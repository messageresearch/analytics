from you we love you and we thank you so we ask you that it's blessed now as we read your word and we know your word is anointed but just come and anoint us to speak your word have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us and guide us in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to sh unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the test testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what for time to understand all right Revelations 14: 6 and I saw another Angel flying in the midst of Heaven having the Everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth and to every nation and Kindred and tongue and people singing with a loud voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and and worship him that made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and The Fountains of water and there followed another Angel saying Babylon is Fallen is Fallen that great City because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the third Angel followed them saying saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast in His image and receive his Mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine or the wrath of God which is poured out without me mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels and the presence of the Lamb you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I made some extra copies of the quotes that we'll be giving out tonight so if anybody uh needs a uh a copy raise your hand and we'll let brother Donnie or some of them pass them out to you of the quotes for tonight they'll be using so if there's any anybody needing a copy of them let's take it and uh you know we don't have them for everybody we just need them if you want them all right some people like to read some read it off the screen and other things all right but now we've read this and we've been talking in This Book of Revelations and been on it now for quite a while trying to just go through the book and see and we got here now to verse six says and there was another angel in the midst of Heaven what having the Everlasting gospel to preach unto to them that dwell on the earth so now remember that you're in heaven with your viewings and things that are taking place but yet on Earth is where the Everlasting gospel is brought forth all right and what is the Everlasting gospel now what would be something that would be in the Bible as I was trying to bring out Sunday what would it be that could be counted as the Everlasting gospel now the word Everlasting can be counted as Eternal it's According to which way it's being used it can be used as talking of God and his ways and everlasting can be the word Eternal so we're talking about then the Eternal gospel or the Everlasting gospel what is the Everlasting gospel what would it be that you could look into the Bible and you could find a Doctrine or a thought because the Bible is a Doctrine you know you say we don't have no Doctrine when you just lied right because everybody's got a Doctrine if you don't have a Doctrine you don't have a church or a thought all right but now what would be then that would tie together in the understanding to each and every one of us that we would see the uh you know and understand it's the Everlasting gospel all right we know for assurity that the first message Jesus preached was what he told Nicodemus he said you must be born again right that was his first Doctrine if you want to call it because the Bible I said is a Doctrine all right and see Nicodemus couldn't understand right because he said now how can I enter my mother's wound and come forth another time in other words would that do me any good if you're saying that I'm messed up this way and I need a uh to be born again and if you'll check your your uh D lots and things there you'll see that it's saying You must be born from above and that's what Nicodemus couldn't catch he couldn't get together the fact of he he could only talk about going back to his mother and coming out again and you he knew that was impossible and he knew that that would not do any good you know to to be able to do that cuz you would just have you know the person there the second time but see it means that you must be born from above amen amen in other words Jesus was saying what you need to do Nicodemus is to be born again in the Kingdom that I'm trying to bring amen right all right and that Kingdom would be the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would come on the day of Pentecost right all right then it says You must be born again oh yeah you need to be born from where I came from cuz what good as I said would it do for us to be born the second time or third time or 10th time upon the Earth but yet when you we could if we could just be born from where he come from all right now the only way that we could ever do that was that God himself would have to come down right and make a way that we could be born again amen all right see it couldn't be just something that we have a thought or a doctorine or idea that is not the new birth cuz that's not your natural birth I you think about it I want to get natural spiritual natural spiritual for enough tonight for us to see something because if your natural birth is Nicodemus say that won't do me any good to do that all right that was exactly right cuz your natural birth it wouldn't make no difference with Brother Ray there born 6 72 years ago right about it was close anyway that's it well what good would it do for him to be born again you know of a natural birth that wouldn't happen but if in some way God could make a way and he did for us to be able to be born into the kingdom that he was speaking of see then that way we could understand but see Nicodemus couldn't catch that amen and he Jesus went on to try to explain and he said if you can't understand these things I'm telling you how can you understand the things of heaven right see Jesus was explaining that he that is Born the flesh is flesh he just born the water water he born this and you know everything coming down he was actually speaking of the fact and to show us that God Almighty himself not a second person right because if it's a second person to it then you got a problem CU you'd have one dying for us and the other one condemning us to hell no you better keep the same God there and understand but see God would make a way by coming down in human flesh and dwelling here with us to be what the scripture would call him Emmanuel God with us amen right not God the son there's no such thing right you can't find that in the scriptures because to see it won't tie up am you won't find the word Trinity in any of your King James translation you might find it in some of these other modern translations today but you won't find it in the original because it doesn't exist all right but now then Jesus would have to explain I'm trying to get to a point where you don't understand what I say in our Sunday that the Everlasting gospel would have to be preached to mankind CU if we're going to get eternal life we have to have the Everlasting gospel right right all right and see in doing that that Everlasting gospel would have to be a message that would relate exactly to what he was doing amen now so then he gets on on over into the scriptures and it says that they're on Calvary when they pierced his side out came water right and blood all right now see that was exactly the thing Jesus was trying to get Nicodemus to see he was trying to tell him look I've got to go die right and he said if you can't understand this natural point that I'm trying to make he said and you are and the original says he was the teacher the teacher the greatest of all of Israel he said and you can't understand what I'm talking about he said how can you understand Heavenly things you know if you can't understand Natural Things see out of the body of Jesus Christ came the elements that would make up the new birth amen all right out of his body body came water blood and life amen right right amen see because that flesh was there no life within it it was gone so out of that would come water blood and life all right now we'll read this in a minute but I'm just trying to make a point in your mind I want you to think about isn't it odd that those things would take place of the water coming out the blood coming out you know the story they couldn't break his leg we know that right the old the custom was that when someone was hanging there and and they were needing for them to die quicker they would just break your legs when they did they just slump down well you drowned in your own inner parts or whatever cut off your breathing and you just die but when they come to Jesus they said no we don't need to to break his legs he's already dead but see some of them standing by said well wait a minute he might be fooling you you know we're paraphrasing cuz you know the Bible not every word not written but said you now wait a minute said you better do something else so they took a spear put it into his side well wouldn't it be an odd situation that they hit exactly to a place now they were hitting his heart right amen right come on he wasn't aiming in his kidneys or his bows or some other place they wouldn't just talkking him to test him they were sinking the spear into his heart right well when they sunk the spear into his heart out came water and blood right see why because he'd already died in agony amen right scientifically speaking they say that you're you can actually come to a place in pain that your water and your your blood will mingle well the scripture says that that he sweat as it were great drops of blood when he was over in the garden of gey see the things were already getting ready to where that when they went to the heart they supposed to get blood right but instead they got water and blood right and out of his body came the elements that would go forth and constitute the new birth all right or make a way for the new birth to come all right then it would make it then it would be an odd situation that's what I'm want you to see I kind of thinking today about it itd be an odd situation to see how that down Through the Ages you had a lot of teachings but is't it odd that Martin Luther would preach that just shall live by faith oh yeah then John Wesley would come along and preach sanctification and then your Pentecostals of zeusa Street 1906 right would come forth preaching the baptism of the Holy Spirit right now is that a coincidence or is that God fulfilling in the natural to show us was it a coincidence back diary that out of his body came these three elements right what water blood and then life amen is it a coincidence that then you would have in the flood the world was washed by water M right right right that's right didn't help it very much did it right but then Jesus when they pierced him his blood fell on the earth to cleanse and claim the Earth right right you know in one of these days the world's going to get a fiery baptism right that's right it's going to cleanse off everything and come and make a place that God and his people can live amen is that coincidental is that something that just happened is it odd then that Luther would preach that just shall live by faith but see then as I trying to bring out Sunday we'll read just in a second what the prophet had to say but see then the Everlasting gospel would be justification right the Bible says the just shall live by faith right Martin Luther they said when he wrote it out he he was reading he wrote right beside of alom in other words that's the only way right that the just can do isn't it OD that the Bible is tied up and coldly speaks of from Genesis to Revelation about faith amen everything is based on faith he that cometh to God must believe that he is amen faith is the anchor of all things right see without faith it's impossible the Bible says that's quoting there to please God right all right there's no way to be born again without faith right see that's what Jesus was trying to place into the hands of Nicodemus what if the man could have had enough understanding to have received it right see to be able to took that and accepted what Jesus said but he couldn't do it see the reason why was because Jesus has never died yet right and see then nobody could come to that place that man needed to come because he had not died right he had not made the way as I said a moment ago for us to be able to understand that you must be born again that's right and there would be no way see for you to do that without the shed blood without the fact that Jesus Christ di amen gave his life that he could come back and live in you and I right right and preach a couple of services there the weekend didn't C the time right I guess I'm kind of like the little boy said about when preacher preached that night they come home and he said I I'm not feeling too good I got a sore throat and the little boy there he said no wonder said you hot you know hollered he said you hollered in the church tonight and said God don't lie for you to holler so maybe maybe that's the way I am maybe don't like for me to holler but think about it then odd coincidences right it's not no odd coincidence to me is it you right amen see Martin Luther started a message that the world was waiting on to fulfill this Angel's message right of the Everlasting gospel see then we can't reject that I believe what Martin Luther taught right right see the truth now not the Trinity he taught not the fact that he would say the Jews were to be took out and be killed no but the message of the day that he brought amen was the just shall live by faith I still believe that today amen and I believe that even like I was showing even the Jews they'll receive this message of the just you live by faith right cuz anything we get from God has to come by faith it can't be an intellectual conception him if it was Jesus Christ died in vain you see he had to give his life forgive me he had to give his life to where you and I would be able to live all right now in doing that then it's easy to understand what is the new birth yes and the days of Mark Luther it was to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and that was it right the days of John Wesley when they come along that was what would be called a second work of grace even though there's not three works of Grace CU it's the same Holy Ghost justifies you sanctifies you and fills you with the Holy Ghost the same Holy Ghost but it's just the way we call it so actually they come along preaching sanctification see John the Baptist preached that you must believe on him that was to come that's right is that odd then wouldn't it be an odd thing then again to say that Jesus began to preach and when he did he said the unclean Spirit goth out of a man see that's sanctification right right and then would it be odd to believe that the disciples preached the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz that's what Peter done on dead Pentecost right he said this is that y it was spoken of by the the the prophets and things right what this is that new birth that Nicodemus couldn't comprehend all right see that it would make it turn out to be what the Everlasting gospel is justification right the only way into the body of Christ is first you must be justified you must repent of your past sins right you don't just walk up shake somebody's hand say I'm born again now I'm I'm too old for for that and you know we we we come from the old school maybe enough to I believe in a definite work of justification I believe in a definite repentance I believe in what the Bible says the goodness of God is what leads you to repent it's not just CA somebody drug you up to the altar that's where people's done it exactly go back in the altar get somebody take them up to the alar say you need to get saved Now where's that in the Bible you can only find it in the Catholic Church yeah when as I say in that Pope got the the decree that he could and wrote a decree back there and said it was better to make people serve God by force than to not serve him in my all you know and that made Millions die for their belief all right but you see then the Everlasting gospel is justification Believing on Jesus Christ accepting him as your savior and repenting amen but see what I find in all of us basically a lot of times is one thing we want to repent for what somebody else done well you know if you ever talk to people say well I'm this way cuz my mama was this way or I'm this way cuz my dad was this way it's my Daddy's fault cuz I a't heard of the nature well you can change that that's right right you change that but you see it's it's repenting for what we done like I always told you was bringing across our minute ago about it it was no Roman spear that killed my savior it was no cross that killed him no Jew didn't kill my savior no Gentile no Roman or nothing didn't kill my savior he died of a broken heart you know why because mankind would not accept him the Bible said he came to his own and his own received him not right but to them that did he gave them power to become the sons of God he putting within them the word that when Pentecost would come the word had to be so down in their hearts MH it's not just walking up to somebody and saying you believe Jesus Christ as your savior yes well you're a Christian no that won't work amen that's just the human knowledge and human knowledge won't save us sure we must have knowledge because the Bible's right when it says faith cometh by hearing that's right and hearing by the word right that's true amen but just because we hear the Bible says the Old Testament Saints Paul in his writing said that they heard but said it not being mixed with faith and them that heard it it didn't do them any good you know there around the time of of Pentecost in the Bible there was a lot of Jews heard the word of God Paul even reasoned daily with them in the synagogues and things and the disciples went everywhere preaching the gospel that's right but you see they couldn't believe it why because it was not mixed with faith right they didn't want to repent of their sins because they didn't think they had any amen right I've told you then and then it was verified by the the the rabbi Richmond and him they believe that circumcision Those Old Testament Jews had been taught and they believe that circumcision put them into a place to where that they were pure because they believe that that was the sinful part and they had that right of what happened in the garden but yet it's because your circumcised doesn't take away the the sin right that's right it was only a natural thing that Abraham had to be circumcised that was a sign of a covenant am that God had already made with him right come on God had done made the Covenant with Abraham in circumcision was just that part in Abraham that made it to where he was displaying to others what he believed that's the way it is in Christianity right right Christianity is not and smoking and drinking and chewing and running around with women that's not Christianity Christianity means a very change of nature right that's what Nicodemus couldn't understand you mean there's something wrong with me I've been told all of my life I'm all right you're telling me I need to be born again but see Jesus was was telling him no I'm trying to tell you I got to go die for you I got to die for your sins but can we believe that he died for us then what is the new birth what is the new birth that would tie together with all of the thoughts of the Bible that you could take Abraham's life and go through the fact of him believing God and then see him over about the 12th chapter that he begins to move on in toward the things and getting in then you see him about 16 and 17 over through there 15 you see him meeting God meeting mzc right but do we really understand justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost as to be the new bir right that's right pure you can believe on the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says that that's what you must do right the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ Thou shalt be saved right amen but then the Baptist came along and they taught us well all you got to do it just believe it yeah just believe that God died for us and you're saved well now Nicodemus had that Nicodemus put his life on the line hey he was a big ruler yeah he knew he was going to get blackballed in a hurry if they found out what he was doing right and he come to Jesus to ask him about some CL are we willing to put our life on the line are we willing to be associated with the word you see then the disciples it took three and 1 half years of Jesus's Ministry to bring those disciples from what they had been taught right come on now they went to church but they had been taught this is the way just stay here believe in great Jehovah and one day he'll Deliver us but you see Jesus had to preach three and 1/2 years it took him a long time to drive that unclean Spirit out of them disciples now that's what he said he said the unclean Spirit goth out of a man walk in dry Places cette come back and find us none you know don't find nothing filled with it y see then as I said isn't it odd that Luther Tau that J shall live by faith and isn't it odd that Wesley taught sanctification the cleansing and setting aside of the person you know that Wesley talked so much on sanctification it even said one day he said ain't no need drinking black coffee he said they ain't nothing in it his house was on fire and he came walking back in according to what I read out of his books he looked up and said well thank you Lord I don't have to worry about that anymore he didn't mean he didn't have to have a house to live in but he had too much tied up so he was thanking the Lord that they set him free from that see those people back there literally believed who was it one of the men down through there was it Moody which one of them was it that raised about 16 17 people from the dead one of the Great Men back there wouldn't even read a newspaper Smith Wiggles work wouldn't even read a newspaper why because he was in that time of sanctification coming forth into the baptism of the Holy Ghost of ausa Street great people living their lives for God oh and is it odd then you'd come to the zeusa street as I said a moment ago and I that would come forth preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost true there was a lot of wrong went with it but so what the message of the hours going around the world today there's a lot of wrong with the people in this messag am more than you are out there in organized religion well what does that matter always the scarecrows is where the good fruit is the food is at you don't build a scarecrow out in the in the pyer where the cows is at that's right you put it right over your garden where the good stuff planted you that's right right but I'm just saying isn't it odd but yet it's not odd it's the way God was doing things right because God here in the scripture we just read this first Angel proclaims the Everlasting gospel the just shall live by faith second Angel was talking about Babylon is Fallen it's fallen and different things are happening sanctification then the third Angel was preaching about the mark of the beast right is that a coincidence like I tried to explain to you about it people are looking for the mark of the beast and already have it if you're not born again you're already sealed out anybody will want I in high sense as brother R used to say order to know that that shouldn't take a revelation if you're not born again you're not in the kingdom of God so you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have an inside teacher so you're already marked oh yeah one of these days it'll come into the hands and come into your forehead cuz where is your forehead your intelligence and things that's your 666 that's your Trinity Doctrine that's in the mind of man around the world right the mark of the beast isn't it odd that a zeusa street begin to preach those things amen then here comes along after them was the prophet brother random picking that up and preaching the mark of the beast the Seal of God the different things and showing us that if we're not born again we already have that Mark don't worry about getting the mark of the beast oh I I I I don't want to get around any other church doctrine I I might get some kind of Mark of the Beast no you're already marked if you're not born again your intelligence intelligence is in your forehead is already filled with a Doctrine seeing Martin Luther like I told you in his soul was a new birth of justification but in his head his mind and things were still motivated by the trinitarian doctrine you said I don't see how that can be well I'm looking at it right and you're looking at it that's right I'm talking about everybody in here okay you want me to call names no matter how much we're born again I we're not born again in our head that's right right we're born again in our soul and them channels between that soul and that head is clogged up by the devil's lies right telling you all you got to do is believe the message of the hour and you're saved now that's a good one isn't it oh yeah M yeah you say well brother D I see you fight that a lot seemingly exactly right because that was the doctrine of the Baptist Church that's where I came from all you got to do is believe you believe Jesus died for you Danny then that means you're saved let's go say it with your mouth I didn't even like to read that scripture I heard it preached on so much I still have trouble sometimes reading it where Paul said you know that you believe in your heart but with the mouth confession is made under salvation kind have heard it preach so wrong and all you got to do is just believe well that means the devil saved right why because he believed the Bible says he did the Bible said he believed and trembled about what he believed now that's scripture go and get your Bible and read a little bit but you see the Everlasting gospel is justification because that's the anchor of all Christianity amen right that's the beginning of all Christianity that's the beginning of the new birth it's justification repentance and asking God to forgive you amen I don't do a thing to your nature you know that if you're in any way at all remember your life a lot of people say boy when I got saved I just believed and I just got filled I've been filled ever since well praise God you're one in a billion there s billion in the world so you're one in a billion cuz that didn't happen in the Bible like that here's Peter and them still wondering if Jesus was the one he was supposed to be right here they were they couldn't get it straightened out finally R it the L Jesus said one day he said now do you finally believe I used to tell about in the Baptist Church I showed that to a Baptist preacher I said the Bible said he that believeth didn't say he that believes and is baptized it said he that believeth keeps on believing you said well what are you trying to explain the New Birth the Pentecostal people who claim the new birth but know nothing about justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost tried to preach that in the man's church one time he got offended at me brother in this message cuz all I was doing was just preaching the justification sanation to baptism of the Holy Ghost and he was a Pentecostal he was supposed to have that Doctrine before I ever heard of it but you see you can only preach really Truth by what you've experienced amen I couldn't tell you what the new birth is if I hadn't experienced that I couldn't tell you what justification is if I hadn't experi I'd tell you what brother Rand said or what Dev said or what Moody said or Knox or Calvin or Billy gr or somebody or I can tell you all about what they said but I know Church what happened to me right I know what happened to me I was 18 years old before it ever even but yet I saw God when I was 11 years old you've heard me tell that I knew right where he was at and everything but I didn't make that my salvation would you see one day I just had to get over the church to get saved you said well you not talk like that but why not when it's the truth I used to hear hear them tell about what salvation was and and I thought well don't line up and I didn't know how to explain it but I knew there I had had an experience I had repented of my sins I'd asked God to forgive me and it wasn't some preacher telling me what I had to do cuz they didn't really know what to do themselves right and I began to read the Bible and I begin to see about those in the Bible and what it done and I said well that's what it's done to me it made me want to go to church did Brother around say if he's in your heart said you can't waitting the doors open all right that's up to you I just preach what I believe right but you see then one day I seen in the scripture I didn't know anything about Wesley's teaching of sanctification sure I talked to my brother he's a Methodist Minister but my Lord he sure didn't have it he had a you don't think I'm telling the truth his grandkids or kids and all gave him a great big old cabinet to put in his house to put his Playboy magazines in he's a man to dis preacher that's no joke heard him the other day at my sister's funeral and I think it's more religious matter in him now than never been I guess cuz he's about 75 76 years old he's probably concerned about himself but he look like he at least had a sincere heart and begin to believe but listen Church what is the new birth do you have the new birth or are you just basing it on your fact that you believe the prophet's message right have you went through the experience of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's right oh no I got it all at one time now I want to see that in the Bible that that's that's all I ask you I want you to lay out in the Bible and show me that because all the way through the Bible it took three and 1/2 years to get them disciples living with the G with Jesus 24 hours a day 7 days of the week I went to church every day but it took three and a half years to get that unclean drove out of them come on am I right see only then would they be qualified to go to the upper room and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost because as Jesus was saying about the the scripture you know covering it that some took the word and kept it you Remember The Parables how did some of got Stony ground some got in this place some got in that and it all eats it up and all the birds come and he said some took the word and kept it you know that was the only ones that was there the 120 in the upper room but you know like I've always said you think they ain't odd things in the Bible my Bible tells me that Jesus was seen of over 500 Brethren after his resurrection but only 120 made it to the upper room you know what they were the only ones that knew what was going on right they had seen the dead raised right they had seen him there and they had walked with him and talked with him but yet he wasn't in the upper room why cuz they let the cares of Life they let this happen they let that happen is that what Jesus was explaining I bought a Yola box and I got to go try them I just married a wife can you have me excused see that's what we've all done right are we like Nicodemus trying to understand it from an intellectual conception or we're depending upon God to reveal it to us amen I know it's a carnal way to express it but it does make a point you take a drunk I've never dranked any so I don't know I had to take what other people said but a drunk will see a pink elephant and he run over you with a knife in your hand trying to get away from the Pink Elephant why cuz the Pink Elephant is more real than you are right to him it is the Bible says one day you'll they'll see these great hideous things brother randam your Prophet said it would be because men had long hair and women had cut their hair off and they would see these hideous things amen and it would torment them right but you see the disciples three and 1 half years before they could be born again why because the word has got to be planted then then and I know the word ain't ain't supposed to be used in aunt but I'm this country there's nowhere in the Bible that anybody was ever born again that didn't hear the word first right now you show me that cuz the Bible will be wrong then when when it said Faith comth by hearing right so you got to hear the word you got to take that word and hold that word that's right sometimes it's hard yes for 2 years I sought a baptism of the Holy Ghost after coming in this message and prior to that I was teaching adult Sunday School classes at 25 years old age and I was a deacon I was everything that could be thought of in the Baptist Church and well thought of my name I found out the other day is still down there written in gold in the bottom of that church because they got all the deacons on one side and all the pastors that had been there on the other side but you see they thought a lot of me cuz I dedicated my life and I found out I wasn't born born again I would to God I could preach tonight hard enough for everybody that I'm looking at and everybody on the Internet is listening that that you'd find out that you're lost right cuz you could do something about it amen right but you sat there looking at me thinking well brother Dale's talking about the New Birth he don't know as much as I know about it well show me in the Bible see three and A2 years it took that took God to drive that word down in their heart amen and only 120 out of all that Hur him was able to go to an upper room and held on to that word long enough cuz what is a new birth it's a birth of the word that's right right no it's an anointing now show me that in the Bible I believe in the anointing I know it's there right but the new birth can't be based on an anointing right cuz David was anointed to kill a giant right in a barer in a line right that's pretty good anointing MH SS in a little bitty runt right was capable of picking up tons of steel of a door out of the ground and walking off with it that's a pretty good anointing that's right Samson take a jaw bone of a an old dried up Jawbone of a donkey and kill a thousand Philistines one lick as the prophet said with that thing would bust it all to pieces but God was in that that's right amen that's all he had all Samson had that he took it and he slew them with it well if we just take a little bit of Faith sometimes and just believe God we' see our sicknesses go down to the drain to just believe it teren s and talking last night about little baby a he running a high temperature sure they took him to the doctor sure they got him medicine thank God for doctors and medicine but the time they got him home and laid down with him a minute he was temperature was broke and he was all right why can't we believe it that way right see we get to the point that we doubt God because he doesn't do for us what he does for others what kind of a child is that am you know m i don't ever remember my mama whing me but I'm sure she did I'm honestly sure she did I just don't never remember but I seen her whoop my brother was 18 years old with a metal ring off of an old wooden barel and all he done was said he was leaving home she said you go back in the house till you calm down then you can leave you ain't leaving mad when she wrapped him with that thing about a couple of times he went in the house and never did leave but you see folks she done him a favor that's right right she done him a great favor sir like I was explaining there the other day those Jews driven to all of the world and God's iner hands of Mercy driving them back to the homelands where he can deal with them in the end time SI over 6 million Jews killed by Ian and Hitler and them to drive them back to the Homeland that's right God was gracious to drive them back because any Jew outside the Homeland is back with come on and any of you and I without the baptism of the Holy Ghost were backslid to start with don't worry about getting back slid don't worry about getting confused that's what people will tell us about the message I'm afraid to talk to you'all about this message I might get confused now you might find out you're confused right see we need to be justified before we can ever be Sanctified amen amen that's right if not we're doing it just like the prophet would say one day he said you can be Sanctified without being justified you know when he says that I'll be glad to give you the quote amen you know why because a lot of people do that without truly being justified and cleansed of God they sanctify themselves and go to church and don't do this and don't do that and they say I don't drink I don't smoke I don't chew I I must be a Christian well what was I when I never done those things but you see when I come in this message and heard that Prophet talking about a new birth I knew I didn't have what he was talking talking about cuz he was talking about a life the new birth is a person of Jesus Christ coming and living in you it's not that justification that's just the work of the holy spirit it's not there at sanctification that's a work of the Holy Spirit that's why you can go that far die and go to hell why because you're not born again you're not born again without the person of Jesus Christ coming and living in you that's right prophet in Christ of Myster God reveals say what is the new word he says the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you right amen not personally to brother Bram and you heard him we were at a church there was three of us I think it was I know there was three and they were praying for us with about the baptism with the Holy Ghost and the brother he was good brother he got up at night he said I believe every one of you got to baptism of the Holy Ghost tonight well I went home knowing that I didn't get it and the other two that claimed of taking his word for it are no longer in the message right so now you can judge your own Point what you want to on it they turn down this message but you see I didn't take his word because that wouldn't do me any good right I knew what the bible say that no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be by the new birth right cuz I'm only saying what somebody else says right right people in this message are right this day taking what brother random said to said I've seen you there and they're taking it that brother brandom saw them there though so they must be saved I know I get very I'm I'm I'm the the guy that spoils the little eggs you know the little things but you know what he was inheld and saw people right now which one was the one he saw me in right oh no I was in heaven brother you can't tell me no ain't no need trying but the actions and reactions shows what we are you get upset for me by saying that you're not born again you know what that just proves you're not born again right a you got no sense to realize that but yet I'm I'm the hateful dirty guy and and and you can't tell me I ain't SA I'm not going to try to you're going to tell yourself that's right because all I'm going to ask you have you been through justification as repentance and an experience of actually God coming to you at that place and letting you know that your sins are gone I've heard people talk about it as a great burden lifting off Brother Gary I've heard him talk about he said it just like bubble danks and for quite a few days and play that's wonderful I believe in it and he used to tell me and said Brother D I think I've got this or that I said well you think it ain't no good you got to have an experience amen that's right amen you know one day he called me from Alabama he used to call me about once a week more than that and say Lord yeah Lord this is working out you know Lord doing this one day he called me he say all settled brother Dale you know to this day I ain't had a bit of trouble with him about talking about the new birth and I holler and scream at him and tell him that unless you get the new birth you're lost and you sat there and say Amen well what do you do with it we don't have the excuse that Nicodemus did because at that time God had not made himself into manifestation that he could pay the price right right right he had not died on Calvary right right the church we're not back in the days of Martin Luther when it was just to live and believe and die the prophet of God said what he said the last three ages the messages of each age completed to birth I said isn't it odd that Luther preached justification Wesley preached sanctification and a Pentecostal preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know that John Wesley called sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost his own writings and it was for that time amen but see now we must be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost that's right that's right you see church I made this plans earlier in the week I'm not just preaching to somebody that's come get that off your mind I made the plans to preach this message earlier in the week to follow after the the message that I brought Sunday of the Everlasting gospel I've already got two sermons wrote down to go with I don't even have to study for Sunday but you see this kept coming it kept coming you've been here long enough to know what I teach about the New Birth those disciples took that word that Jesus brought amen and that word cleansed them I thought we believe we were Washed by the Water of the word I thought we believe the scriptures that unclean Spirit was driven out of them and they went to the upper room to wait sure we know the story they get in the upper room and they say well I think we've got it let's just take it by faith but somebody had enough G to stand up and say well we ain't got what he said when is the preachers of this message going to tell their congregation you ain't got what they what you think you got you know the blood's going to be on their hands it's not going to be on mine cuz I've told you I ain't going to have to I may have to answer for a lot of things but it won't be for not telling you what the new birth is and what that you need to be born again it's true well I'm just good I go to church whatever you want me to do won't you get born again won't you get born again yes Lord talking to the car pror today about it I said why is it that people can't have an experience with God it takes them to a place that they can stand all the troubles and things what's the matter with us right but you see that's the trouble of the people this mess you they go good for a little while right you see them come in and this let go good for a while and I like I tell you it's like a candle burning at both ends while that's going to burn out then you see them drift right back where they come from or go back to a worship place man it stood right here and preach years ago right here in this church and preach years ago because of the fact of what was happened related to the to the different about the the where brother Brandon was hunting out there he backslid he went back to the denominational church if you want to see him on the your YouTube you can pull him up look at what you call it Facebooks or what that's on there you can see him and his wife they're proud I ain't going to get on Facebook I'm not proud the way I look but see people are so proud they got their little shorts on and their haircut off and then they're so proud they're liberated I didn't know I was ever B right you know that those Jews didn't believe they were in bondage go back and read your Bible they said we're never in bondage to no man right there they were under the Roman author being killed see they didn't believe it amen they believe they was free we go over cook the Seas and we liberate them women and the next time you see them what have they got painted face and ha cut off running down through the bars and strip naked did we liberate them oh but listen Church what is the new birth justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost I knew that my experience of justification was true because I had experienced it I had seen God I had talked to him I had felt him so close but yet when the prophet began to explain the new birth I knew I had missed it cuz I was putting it on some feelings or ideas and feelings are wonderful look feelings without the truth is satanic right do what you want to with it I shouted I cried I spoke in tongues you want me to give you a quote I just run it off a minute ago brother around said you're Pentecostal say I spoke in tongues he said and deny the birth of the word he didn't pull no bone the prophet said it like this and you've heard it I've got them laying here if you want these notes you're welcome to it he said false prophets produce false births amen he said true prophets produce true births the birth of the word amen what is the New Birth the birth of the word who is he I thought my Bible said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's what I thought the Bible say so then we need we're supposed to be word children right not intellectual Giants Amen on that that's but word children amen I sitting after all these years of studying and doing setting today just going on through read reading the book of Revelation sitting there just wait said God thank you for showing the truth I can read these things now and they just make beautiful sense to me yeah right amen sister said the other day she said the prophet said it we read the Bible but said when you explained it said it's a whole L better well that's all I'm trying to do right amen would you just explain this about the New Birth cuz what is the New Birth the birth of the word what is this Mark of the Beast to reject the word right right you reject the words you're automatically marked with the mark of the beast the others comes later where you buying and selling but it's pretty close now cuz you can't buy and sale now without a social security card if you do you buy findy it from some other point but they automatically want something they want your telephone number or whatever now before you can make a transaction it's pretty close but you see the prophet go to the Future home and read what he saids it's in the notes here if you want it he said justification does nothing to your only chops off your pie sins it does nothing to your nature right those disciples had that same nature walking right there with the Lord Jesus that they started out with you want the scripture for it did not the very man that we put our emphasis on the day of Pentecost coming with the word did not Jesus say to Peter one day get behind me Satan is that Bible why because he knew that was the devil talking it wasn't Peter right amen see you can't the Bible said you cannot see the kingdom without the new birth right see means to understand not see like understand yes Lord sanctification is when that unclean Spirit go out of a man and you know the easiest way to find out whether the unclean spirit is gr out of a man or not pretty good way I ain't going to do it but pretty good way to find out you know I don't know where that got that on there not but I sure didn't hit that's a good way to find out let somebody hit you you'll find out what you are right let somebody cross you you'll find out what you are you can see where the unclean spirit's gone out or not that when your enemies can hang you on a tree and you still pray for her amen can you do that can you pray for the people who lambast you and make fun of you and lied about what you preach and everything can you pray for them then you're not born again prophet of God said one day what he said now if you want to know the evidence of the Holy Ghost he said let's get here in the Bible right where was it Zeki about the rider's inkhorn go through and Mark and Mark those that are signning and cry for the Abomination done in the city he said that's a good way to tell whether or not you're born again can you truthfully forgive someone that does anything against you even though they don't ask you easy to give somebody to ask you M what if they don't ask you can you forgive them well we'll never come to the rightly in Mark 11 CU Mark 11 words speaking of if you say to this mountain you better read on down about to 25 I think it is but somewhere right along in there it says if we don't forgive we won't be forgiven amen H right that's right if we don't forgive we can't be forgiven that's right see that's the nature of Christ you know what Christ was trying to do to show the disciples the nature that they needed to have right right come on was that right he was trying to show them the nature they needed to have and they couldn't understand it they knew that he could just and everything would be gone what about them hanging around Paul when he got over there oh Paul used to turn around in S turn him over to S but then one day he got to wor it looked like he couldn't do nothing you know what he was the crowning crowning day of his ministry but yet it looked like the worst day he' ever had you know the crowning day of Jesus's Ministry that proved he was a Christian was the day he hung on the tree for me right amen that's when he proved he was a Christian are we willing to be on a tree Paul said I would that I could be a cast away from my people and only after saying that did God speak to him and say all Israel will be saved Paul come on read your Bible not every Israelite but the Israel of God will be saved cuz Paul prayed for him can you pray for your enemies can you pray for them that despitefully use you and that's what the scripture say so what is the new birth then justification choing off your pie sins sanctification being cleansed and set aside by the words you hear right same as identical with the disciples and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth yes which is Christ in you the nature of Christ The Life of Christ the very soul of almighty God coming into you by the New Birth the very life of almighty God that would die for those who were persecuted amen well a man done at work one day he said Jesus had long hir I can have long high I said if you'll show the nature of Jesus Christ I won't say one word about your heart that's what I told you said I won't say one word about your life I won't say a thing in the world about a woman that shows the nature of Jesus Christ cuz you know you ain't going to do it unless you're born again if you're born again it's automatically going to be a LIF lived right you you don't have to worry about a man where you got a highcut or not you don't have to wear woman about where she cuts her high or not if she's a Christian right those that keep cutting her High ain't Christians amen even the Little M off a little thing little you're not a Christian but see the new birth is the Life of Christ coming in it's not a Doctrine you know a doctrine of of brother of random I believe everything he says read Christ a Myster of God revealed but brother brand will tell you that it's Christ revealed in you that's the new birth amen amen The Life of Christ Living in US that's the effect or the what do you call it the production or the the coming forth from the just shall live by faith right so we're still saying that we're still still talking about that just shall live by faith you know the Lutheran says we're a bunch of fanatical nuts Antichrist is never you know what we say we say we believe what Luther t that's Luther talked to just you live by faith what is anywh the same God that walked the shores of Galilee you got to be living inside of you if it ain't we're going to argue and fuss about it right right we're going to grab and complain until that happen right see brother Dale but you're telling me that I'm not born again I wish I could I wish that God I could tell you that enough to get you to believe it and do something about it amen amen right brother accused me of the saying that one time he said I said something to about this brother was went to church here and I said a Christian don't act like that he went away and told everybody that I said he wouldn't a Christian I didn't do it I said a Christian wouldn't act like that now if he's going to go act like that then he was one admitting he wasn't a Christian I didn't have anything to do with it but you see him until this day he won't come back why cuz he went somewhere where somebody tell him it was a chrisan that's the way they doing this message right I mean in this message you just find your church to go to to tell you're all right you shop around a little while you'll find you one they'll say everything's okay righten but you see following up from the Everlasting gospel the way today the only way the judge can live by faith is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right now I'm ending with this statement the only way you can be truly Justified is to have the new bir talking with somebody the other day about it where that they showed me where brother brandham had actually in this brother in his church had put this out about to do it brother R says the the justifica that the the new birth and the baptism is two different things I got that quote you want it be glad to look at it with you he said I can conclusively prove that you're born again by Believing on Jesus Christ and then baptized into the body amen what's he teaching adoption that's what we're going to get on in this Saturday right adoption you're born into the family but that don't make you an adopted manifested son or daughter of God right the growth development the stature of a perfect man has to be involved right see you do start your salvation by believing amen if it's truly justification right now you understand that I've explained justification for an hour now right the Everlasting gospel for an hour that everything's based on faith then where would it be any problem with what I just said you start your Christianity when you start believing and As Long as You Keep On Believing God's going to keep coming to you that's right until one day now what if Brother Gary would have been when I told him one day about the he was talking to me he was studying on the godhead and I said Brother Gary you're trying to figure it out I'm talking about Brother Gary cuz he didn't get mad at me I said you can't figure it out brother you're going to go crazy trying to figure it out you wait and let him reveal it right and he'll reveal it to you right sister G when he says that ain't nothing but one do well you know that's all it takes we don't have to have W BL blang blang all over her head and running out her earbobs and I mean ear loes and everything else to have a revelation it's just believing God right and taking him at his word amen that's right he said it and I believe it amen now I want him to reveal it that's right right but if I stop believing right well brother D I've been believe in a long time and and I'm just just having problems I've been believeing we poor little baby you're not going to get no sympathy out of me on that because babies have got to go through growing up you know what you know the only way a baby gets anything to eat is cry you know the only way that it is like I've always told you isn't it something how many of you remember this in your Christian experience come on musician you remember when you used to when you first got converted that you asked God for anything he just give it to you he just poured it out on you right then one day you ask him and you didn't get it right you said wait a minute now what's wrong what's wrong Lord you ask him again you don't get it you got a child train you amen would it be something for your kids to come along to you and they come up every day and say daddy I'm I D you born for Mom and Daddy you come back and am i d i mean a while I'd get upset with that wouldn't you and I say son who do you think you are I put a little sting on they don't ask me that question again cuz if you're that dumb there's something wrong with you we need to take you to the mental institution we got all the signs and everything else we got your birth certificate we got everybody in the country knows who you are why you keep doubting who we are right well you know what my point is this when God tells you something and you read it in the word just take that and stand right there amen and he don't bother you at all reminding him of things you say Lord I've repented of my sins I've tried to study your word to let it cleanse and sanctify me and take away my Deeds that I done in the body you know I quit this I quit that because the word said to that you said you'd give me the Holy Ghost he says that's my child just stay right there that's what I've done two years I everybody in the country to pray for me everywhere I went I went to the altar God I wanted to new bur then brother mod said Brother D I don't know what you're doing I said I don't either he said I don't think you're the kind of seeking signs and wonders to prove that you're saved I said no ain't got nothing to do with it you know what he said but this one thing says God is his word right and said what he says is true he said he'd give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost right he said now just accept it but I didn't go around and tell everybody I got it I got it that's fine if you do I hope you do but see God come down one day my wife and I both received the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same night she fell one way I fell the other she fell under a drunk's feet had get some things put on her that drunk was looking at her he was a drunk sitting on front row in the church he was just looking at her but you see something was settled well did you see VES did you see dreams did you speak in tongu you shout no no no no I saw God not even like I saw him when I was 11 years old right and I saw him in his word he was staring at me through his word I love that picture word it just got Christ standing in the word dra out you know with the letter that's beautiful because you see I don't believe your new birth ends when you get born again that's right no more than I believe that Jonas ain't going to grow no more no he's going to grow and a little old when I always call him back there dawn little Dawn he's going to grow all he needs is food that's all a Christian needs is just the word of God to read it study it you're going to come into the new birth somewhere if you're genuine amen but until that day you may have to wait but see those that wait long come out with a greater experience right you think old Paul didn't think he was a Christian he was doing everything in the world trying to prove he was God said Paul I need way to do it let me show you how to do it so we just slapped him down got him down on his knees and blinded him then when he received the new birth he didn't want to kill nobody body but listen to what I'm saying he changed from trying to kill people for what they believed he changed to a point of trying to get people to believe the word that would kill them man asked me one day he said when that happened with Jim Jones or the other Jim Jim Jones outfits you remember down there all like that and the man asked Fred Hooper one day said is Sam ever tried to get you to kill yourself he said he does it ever service cuz you see we got to die out that's right to be born again okay let's stand what do we got 280 in the red book 280 in the red book anybody have a need I am voice and it I love but all rise in the Earth and cath gave somebody stole her cof CL right we came up here just made a simple prayer and asked God to give it back and you know what it just came back brother klie was up speaking here and the man stole his guns just a simple prayer God giving his guns back you know what he got his guns back right how many more testimonies is throughout the congregation here things youve asked for see it be brought back that's what our sister's asking for Brother Don had a little black book thing made with songs in it and everything and it's got gone let believe God s my wife lost picture the other day she searched the house over for some pictures that was made of the banquet and the thing she searched everywhere she sat down in the chair where she always sits and looks at the cattle out there in the field and just reached her hand down in the side of it you know what there the pictures were well did she put them in there or did God put them in there I ain't going to worry about it she got her pictures back let's B let's believe that father in the name of Jesus Christ we call for look come back we believe you know right words out youing Backus anybody else you why not believe one crack off for some of his heers you know there to the place of having some C he want to take care of that but he's also got a bad Co so we're going to pray and believe that everything will be all right with the help but we're going to bring the bed father in the name of Jesus Christ we this PR she going to make all of the animal without the bird and the only because we believe now we ask you to take away the in the name of Jesus my little sister has a very special request so let's believe father I little sister has a special request something special to her so we just ask you come there and make that man and she'll come back and tell us about because she believes you we believe you we thank you in Jesus name anybody else you simply believe thank God for it believe they're standing for old member cold they're standing for him tonight and asking the Lord would reach down and touch him he got in that age you know problems so let's just believe it father they're committing to you just a little he's at an age where things are going wrong stop from being tou his heart in Jesus believe it anybody else just believe you don't have to see to believe we believe to see God give it it'll feel good pray that you would just everybody be all right thank you for that without you she problem now you do this anybody else what about it do you have the new birth why me Jesus everything we love you and we thank you anybody else believe why would we be in church if we wouldn't believe why would we even try or serve or do anything we wouldn't believe but believing is simply it's the simplest thing to is I don't know I've even been accused of saying you believe this you believe this anything I believe anything I can see and can prove I believe but see a lot of people can't believe because they got to have something to hold on to you know what brother R said if you got to have something to hold on God be good enough he said they needed something to hold on to and he gave them tongues to hold on to it why can't you believe it yes I've seen these little kids here do it and you've seen it I've took out a $20 bill and laid out before one of these kids here have done it many times and say you believe I'll give you that and you know they don't doubt me at all right they don't doubt me they believe I give it to them and I do that's not trying to buy something or pay it off or it's just making a contact to see if you can believe me that I would do anything I could to try to help you how much more confidence have you got in believing a God that cannot fail cuz I can fail and not be able to take care of my commitments or whatever but God can't just believe it just say thank you Lord yes do Brother Ray the other day with his arm and we done would you s Lord just reach down and take this problem away from it and you know it just went away well all I got to do is just say thank you Lord hallelujah I love you thank you Hallelujah if not why you going to pray I mean do you think you got to do something I was talking to that chiropractor today and he said people thinks they got to do something to get God on their side I said yeah you can't never do nothing don't never try to appease God that's that's going worse than Catholicism that's on back to the total po when they offered their kids you know would give their kids up to an alligator because they believe that was a God don't TR to appease God just ask you and I like the way the prophet said it one day he said a know from God is greater than any El you could think of do you know that the Bible says that those people there the children of Israel they asked for
