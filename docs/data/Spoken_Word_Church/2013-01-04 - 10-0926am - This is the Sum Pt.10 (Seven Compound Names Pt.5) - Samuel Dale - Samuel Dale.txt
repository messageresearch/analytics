word right amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading from Hebrews 8 and Ecclesiastes 12 forgive me got to group it this morning amen so just remember these that are away today remember the Labby Grace I know you have but she's running a temperature and all yesterday and things old sinus congestion and but she'd be all right but just keep praying for her that the Lord would would take care of everything and also remember brother dick and gaale he had some problems with his truck you know we were praying that they Gail asked you know to pray that the truck would be able to to go and burn back well when they got down I think it's about eala that somebody stopped them and told them that they were were blowing oil out you know the car the truck and and if hadn't it would have blowed up you know and burn it up or or start destroyed the motor but they got they got it fixed as far as I know when I talked to him Friday I guess it was and they were getting it fixed and and all so you know the Lord is still with us no matter what we think we think well now you ought to be able to drive down there and back with no wall in it well that's all right he can do that too you know he can do that that's no problem but he just does it his way so we accept his way of doing it so just remember that White's over with brother Hughes uh speaking this weekend for him and did you say Brother Dean down brother brother Harris Brother Dean down at brother Harris preaching for him this weekend uh the Lord willing this coming Wednesday we will have uh some of you children young kids going to the meetings and all you may know him but it'll be uh brother Jason Watkins son Matthew the Lord willing will be here here with us uh preaching this coming Wednesday all right so remember that remember Brother Ray Gabriel he fell uh there Friday and HT his knee and I also just pray that the Lord would would take care of that and his knee would be all right amen couldn't come this morning couldn't get in the car but just just remember that and take that the Lord would be with him amen we just appreciate it any other announcements I generally fail to do something but anyhow uh I gave you a list of all the preachers that would be coming in October and November and all so we're pretty well booked up and all but just pray for each one of them I gave it to you the other night on there but just remember that father we thank you we love you and we thank you for all things and we know that you give them to us freely we're glad we didn't have to pay for anything cuz as a human mortal if we tried to pay some something then we think that we had something to do with it but we realize and know that we have nothing to do with whatsoever it is it all comes from you and is all free that you give it unto us freely we thank you and just have your way bless all of these that we've asked to remember and just be with each one Lord and just have your way that the Lord would guide each one and we pray that you'd be here today with us as we try to speak about your word that you would come Lord and speak to each one touch the lby there with the temperature and dismiss it from her and all Lord we believe you thank you for all things Brother Ray leg we believe everything is all right and just have your way in Jesus name amen Hebrews 81 now of the things which we have spoken this is the PS we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens now you can go on down and read and see who this is we know it's about Jesus because he's the minister of the sanctuary but just getting the point you know that Paul is summing up all he said and then saying this is the sum of it we have such a great one a high priest all right Ecclesiastes 12 and verse 13 Ecclesiastes finishing up his conclusion of the matter and he says let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man you may be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word yes sir I don't see boy or any of there he is sitting over the corner J is a Jason leaving is uh Ashley's husband leaving next Friday next Friday I thought I thought he was leaving pretty quick to go overseas so just remember that and keep him in your prayers I wanted to read a a little testimony to you I asked the sister to give it herself but she didn't want to so I said you just write it down and this is this is about Mary Gabriel but she didn't want me to put her name on it okay so this is this is about Merit okay and it's was a wonderful testimony I thank God says Friday night the weekend of the banquet in North Carolina me Joyce and hope were sitting around talking in the hotel room and I suddenly noticed a spot or something in my vision and considering the previous eye problems I've had any other time I've seen spots in my vision it always meant that my retina had become detached so my first reaction quicker than anything was fear I remember looking at Joyce and only being able to see hi her face but I tried not to let it bother me so I laid down and I place my right hand over my right eye and asked the Lord to touch me and heal me of whatever it was that was causing this spot to come in up in my vision and when I woke up the next morning thank the Lord it was gone I haven't had any more problems with it since that night Hallelujah the devil keeps trying to tell me that it was nothing and that it would have just went away on its own but I won't listen and continue to give God the glory for it every day amen am wa got a testimony amen okay now we've been talking about the seven compound names of of Jehovah and trying to get it together to where that we can uh see it in the way that I believe God wants us to to see it and uh forgive me for repeating a lot but uh I believe repetitive things is necessary because when we were in school we didn't go to school one day and they said 1 + 1 equal 2 then we went day two 2 + 2 = 4 day three no you didn't do that did you every day you kept going back even when you got up into algebra you know and you got into trigonometry and and all of the things that would go with the mathematical forms you still saying what 1 + 1 = 2 2 + 2al 4 so it's not a problem for me to repeat things as Paul said one day because I believe it's necess necessary for us to to understand right now what have we been talking about that the prophet of God said I gave you the quotes on it if anybody needs them uh send me an email or anything I on the internet ways uh you know send me an email be glad to give them to a year backup a few services and you'll find them but the prophet of God says you cannot separate any of those seven compound names of Jehovah because they all are in Jesus Christ now if he was one of those seven compound names it would be necessary then that he be all the other and as I tried you know going through in the series talking about it there's a whole lot more things in there that you can go through you know that you can get into the the uh you know the Ros of Sharon and Lily of the Valley the bright and Morning Star but it's really all contained with with in the seven compound names of Jehovah you know Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Tish you all the way through and uh it's all contain therein and you cannot look at one greater than the other see see that's our problem I'm I'm trying to get it to you I'm trying to get it to me okay so you listen to me talk to myself see we we put more emphasis upon Jehovah Gyra saying the Lord is our sacrifice and then we kind of downgrade it over a little bit as we may be sorry for the language but this human we kind of put it down a little lower to talk about Jehovah RFI as our healer and I told you the reason I keep saying that is what it's true I think that we don't dare go around and saying well I don't know whether I'm saved or not I think I'm saved maybe I'm saved maybe I'm well I don't know things works out pretty good you know if I get feeling good I'm saved you know we don't say stuff like that do we we don't try to take anything in against the fact that we're saved right all right but then we'll take in all kind of things against the fact that we're healed we listen to the doctor and thank God for them but we listen to them above the word the word says we're healed that doesn't mean you don't go to the doctor see that's that's what the truth is so hard to preach brother brandom out there you know praying for the sick and I remember seemed like a 62 the Jehovah gyus series I believe it's in California but anyhow he was preaching and the sick was being healed all kind of Miracles were taking place and you know what he was doing he's going to doctor every day because of his stomach problem that he was very sick well boy he didn't down no faith well now you going to talk to God about that so that's all right you go talk to God to see who's got faith and who ain't and when Jesus raised a little boy from the dead and sat on a rock and grown of a headache you go talk to God about whether or not he had Faith all right see that's where we want to prop everything up you know make some special case about ourselves you know or some kind of thing and that's where our trouble is right we don't put put the fact that Jehovah Gyra and Jehovah rapi is in the same atonement cuz the prophet said you cannot preach salvation without preaching healing and you cannot preach healing without preaching salvation amen well brother d by stripes with heal right but if he hadn't went to Calvary I keep making that statement I hope it'll don't on you if he had went to Calvary and paid the price that beating on his back would have been no good it would have been worthless right you see you should and talk like that why not it gets the point across to you because healing is in the atonement of Calvary you can't separate it wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity with his stripes we healed you can't separate it you got to put it together but that's what I'm saying we make one more than the other why why would we do that why would we get on in like we're going today on on Jehovah T you the Lord is our righteousness now you going to make that less than our sacrifice well I just you know I just can't see really what you're saying well that's what I'm saying there shouldn't be any problem about what I say now there might be a problem about what you understand about it but there shouldn't be any problem about what I say I'm trying my best to be as blunt as I can that without him being Jehovah jyra our provided sacrifice what good would it be for being a banner or a or a peace or righteousness or any what what would it be if he's not our savior all right now here's the point I try to make across I'm not preaching against what somebody else believes that's their business I'm just trying to tell you the truth amen then it would all have to be based upon who died at Calvary right all of the seven compound names would have to be based upon who that was and if that was not God that died on Calvary then we're we're still in our sin we have no more than anybody else has we have a philosophy but if that was God that died then there's hopes that he can be our sacrifice amen by accepting him right all right then if he is our sacrifice he can be our healer see what you say but brother Dale see that's what we do we we take and say well brother Dale brother so and so said that his God couldn't die well what's that got to do with it your Prophet said God died well no no God can't I got quotes where God can't die yeah well what about the quotes where he did what about the quotes where he took upon himself the human realm to live with us and die that you and I might have it because if he didn't die then how could his life come back upon us if that was a man now I know what their their statements I know what your Prophet said but if that was a man that died on Calvary then some way in the world we're going to have to find Salvation after we get out of this world because there's no way in this world that a man can die for another man right amen so you better start your Doctrine somewhere about how it's going to be great when we get over there you know see I'm just just as honest as I can be about it to try to get you to see if God didn't die then we have no savior that's right he said but brother Dale God can't die I know the story but it's like I try my best to preach to you when that body was born that was a creation God created a body to come down and live in and he came and lived in that body at the birth cuz your Bible said born this day in the city of David is a savior which is Christ the Lord he was Emmanuel God with us amen sure we know what happened at the River Jordan that's when the fullness that's when all things came because he couldn't die for for you and I as a baby he couldn't die for us at 12 or 13 years old when he could talk to the to the people at the temple he couldn't die first at that time cuz he was not anointed to be that to to finish it all up all right but see on Mount there I mean there on River Jordan he became the anointed became anointed your Prophet said now how can an anointed become anointed I don't know ask brother brand all but you see trying to be straight and honest about it people think I'm hateful in the basis of what I'm do I am hateful in one thing if me and you don't get this pretty quick yeah hey I'm looking at a lot of 65 and 70 year old people that a few more years folks somebody better be ready to take over because we ain't going to be around here very much longer so we better get serious about what it is now and then some of you in the 50s is pushing it see but see church I'm just trying to get you to see who what happened at Calvary God came down and lived in that baby yes Soul and Spirit came into that body and live made him God Emmanuel but one day that Soul and Spirit left out of that body Jesus said into thy hand I Comm in my spirit it left out of the body that's what died the body then went to to the grave and laid there for three days while the very soul theop of God your Prophet said went to hell to speak to the souls in prison he came back up raised up the body and went up and that same God the prophet said come back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's our sacrifice yes I'm talking about an eternal God that would make a way your Prophet said he'd made his a way by coming himself he didn't send somebody else he came himself to die to release that life that it could come back upon us and he could be Jehovah Gyra then if he can be Jehovah Gyra now don't downgrade anything for the rest of the things that we're talking about in other words don't make them smaller what I'm telling you that we're doing we take what the doctor said what the the you know somebody as quick as somebody get something what you do now we become our own doctors I won't call her name she might do like to me to say things about it a certain sister one time was at the doctor and this I best I can remember almost the exact wording of it but the doctor said you're that lady that doctors yourself cuz you know what we do what happens when you get sick what happens now when you get sick you run into the the computer you type it in and then you start reading right the doctor tells you something you used to the doctor said you got to you know hle hery I didn't know what in the world it was if he told me I had one what's it matter I just need something for it but see I don't H everybody's got I don't H everybody got this everybody's got that you know well see we're not taking God to just say by his stripes I'm Healed now when the Salvation comes up do you run the quotes to try to find your salvation now this is about four Services I've been heavy on that I know it but do you do that do you run the quotes up into the prophet's message to find out if you're saved no no no I'm saved well why run the quotes up with the doctors to find out whether you're healed or not but you see we take what the doctor says and wonderful thank God for it that's what I asked sister Kathy this morning I said Brother Ray go and I hope he's hearing this if he is get your hard head over there to the doctor and let him run and check your leg out to see if you got any problems I'll pay for it if you need it let them look at good X-ray on it check the thing over you'll call in a few minutes nothing wrong with going to the doctor right what's wrong with it but ain't no need now brother Ray for you to run in the computer while we're talking to see what what happened if you fall three foot or 4ot or 8 foot see we get it all tied up we become up to where we don't really just accept what God says God says I'm healed amen that's right God says I'm Healed let me say I'm Healed all right go down to the doctor and the doctor looks you over and he says hey you got s good do now give me something for it help me well but you understand what I've been trying to drive at now yes I know I'm hitting it hard but I'm I'm trying to drive it within my own brain as well as yours that's right there is no difference in what the value of each one what would it be brother Al was talking to him about the other day he had a good point he said it's all just one package Jehovah Jehovah Jehovah it's all in one package it's all in Jesus Christ all right let's don't value one over the other because somewhere out of this now I'm go ahead and make a statement where you can think about it all of the compound names of Jehovah now listen all right our Old Testament definitions all right words now we use something in you cuz we La it over but get what I'm talking about now I haven't found one yet now everybody listening I haven't found one yet out of the seven compound names of Jehovah that deals specifically with a change of the body I'm open for comments all of them are Earthly or whatever you call it now forgive me all of them are dealing with a while we're here on Earth okay so we're going to have to go above this righten but it won't be above this it'll have to come out of this because now what have we been talking about the reason you know he's Jehovah Gyra is because of a personal experience of Salvation within your soul amen right that's right all right now then if that be true why can't we believe that the healing is based upon the individual person now we're not talking about healing for everybody right cuz that's not what they believe but it's still coming from a a connection through their inner being for them to be able to believe but see the connection we need to make is that soul that says that I'm already saved and then when are we going to get to the basis to say I'm just as healed as I'm saved and Let It Come From the Inside Out amen your Prophet said your Resurrection lies within you that's right come on but you see then the Rapture will have to come out of what we're the brain that's right but if we don't get it in the correct order come on if I'm wrong show me take all the compound names and show me where it's tied to the Rapture you're going to have to get this Rapture first what resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's the first part you got to get right that's if we don't get that right then if we got it right in here why can't we believe the body is just as healed as our soul is saved amen now if that don't don't on you don't hit you hard enough I'll keep saying it over and over because it's true right we put more emphasis upon our Salvation than we put Upon Our healing that's right but the scripture said the same God that died for me also healed me now see we're in our ways we say oh no no Brother D we don't want Jesus to get back up on AC Cross or we don't want him beat again but subconsciously that's what we're saying we're saying that subconsciously within us that he needs to do something else now what else can he do he said his word that healed us is that true now but think on these things see if one of the seven compound names applies to Jesus all must apply and all must apply with equal quality no Brother D I believe we need to have a I believe we need to be saved but it's not necessary for that saving and healing to come under the same well now you show me where that's at well we don't maybe need him as our Banner our Shield as much as we do our Salvation now what kind of a mentality do you have let alone spiritual revelation if he's the same yesterday today and forever then we better believe it but are you following me now I'll keep repeating that I'm sorry but that's just what I want to do but you see it all depends upon who it was that died at Calvary right it all depends upon who was beat because if you don't understand you're missing it cuz you're saying that we're beat that the beating of Jesus healed us well what are you saying saved us are you going to make up two persons two identities no if they're not the same then you don't have the same well brother so and so I don't care if everybody in the message listen folks I don't went too far I don't care if all of you leave I don't I mean I don't say it wrong now I'm say it in the best way that I can I don't care if everybody in the world differs with me I still believe God my family my my kids my wife and everything grandkids and great grand if you don't agree with me that's that's up to you my God is real thank you he's not ative of your imagination amen and he's just as much Jehovah J and he's just as much Jehovah RI he's just as much as any of those compound names as we're going through because the pointed I've been making what he would not do us any good to be Beat to Death there on while he was alive had it not been for the fact that he went to Calvary and died to pay the price because the healing is not in the chemistry of the blood that's right it's the faith in the blood is what heals you amen it's the life of God that must come forth because only God can create Sals to heal you that's right amen the doctor sets the bone but he can't heal it like I was giving our the other night where brother around and said take somebody that's got a sword on them and then bomb them you know get them ready go to the Grave he said you go out there every day he said you shoot pen aying in there he said it won't heal it right I want it because it does before you die no because there something wrong see the life is gone it's the life of God that we must have within us amen that's right not a concept or an idea it's the life and then with the life comes the healing all of these must apply to Jesus Christ okay now let's get into the next one which is Jehovah tiu if you'd like turning your scriptures turn to to uh Jeremiah 23 but let me say this while we're going through now I've tried to explain it CU somebody out there hears it and then they wonder what's going on they don't know what they're talking about Jehovah TI can you is spell two different ways you run it through and you get into your your uh in system and computers and everything you'll find it spelled two different ways one of them is t s i d k n e the other one is spelled TS i d q e n u all right just to make sure that you like I said you won't find a lot of these in the Bible written out but but it's verified by the prophet because he was the one that was telling us about the seven compound names of Jehovah right all right but look at Jeremiah right and let's see what this is Jeremiah 23 verse 5 behold the days come sayth the Lord that I will raise unto David A righteous Branch all right now this is speaking of the restoration of David to the throne in the Millennium to rule as you know David Son of David speaking of Jesus Christ right the branch that will be in the Millennium was the promise to David that his son would sit on the throne Solomon in the natural ascended to the throne of David but that that was not the promise that you keep reading back there it was the promise of Jesus Christ all right now the branch cuz you run that all the way through the scripture of the branch David A righteous Branch a king shall reign and prosper and shall ex execute judgment and Justice in the earth in his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and this is the name whereby he shall be called that's where they get it now Jehovah tishu which is the Lord our righteousness now that's a promise that the son of David is going to sit on the throne in the Millennium because he's going to rule as king all right now but see he is our King by the baptism of the Holy Ghost because we are the children of God we're the offsprings of the king see all right so now the natural is going over but see the spiritual is staying here because Psalms 50 and6 says the heaven shall declare his righteousness amen the heavens will declare it right sir when this takes place let's read on down go to verse 7 and you'll see what I'm saying therefore behold the days come now that's the Millennium see in the natural now watch behold the days come sayth the Lord that they shall no more say the Lord liveth which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt now look at the next verse they won't say that a day comes that you won't say the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt cuz that could be done back there when they come up out of the land of Egypt all right but what verse eight but now what's going to be said but the Lord liveth which brought up and which left the seat of the House of Israel out of the North Country listen and from all countries whether I had driven them and they shall dwell in their own land that's exactly what's taking place right now it won't be just said that God brought them out of Egypt it will be said God has now put them back into the home land right all right now they got to be in the Homeland before the millennial rign can take place see so it just keeps right on going but who is it said the Lord who the Lord our righteousness all right now if he's your savior Jehovah J if he is your savior then you don't have any righteousness of your own right cuz the Bible says my righteousness is filthy rags that's right but his righteousness all right to declare Romans 3 and 26 or 25 because someone has to declare his righteousness now you see where we was at back few weeks ago where the prophet of God in the church age book was talking about the righteousness and if we ac accept the fact that he died for us by our Union with US 31 Church age book we have become the very righteousness of God because we're not the Jews waiting for the Millennium that's a natural things but just showing you how wonderful God's promise is that he promis now I brought him up out of Egypt that was showing his righteousness but that's not all of it that I'm going to put him in the land back where they come from all if you notice in verse uh 8 and from all countries right everywhere around and that's what I enjoyed about the brother that was here that was you know brother Solomon Solomon you pronounced it that if you're a Jew and connected with a certain amount of bloodline right today you just call them up and they'll come and get you they'll pay your ticket and take you home and he said you don't have to apply for citizenship you don't have to do like we do in America wait 15 years to do something and go through all of these time he said when you land in Israel they will hand you unquestionable your citizenship that's how much they're wanting to bring the people home now I didn't ask him so I don't know how much you got to be a Jew but that's like I've told you waiting in my turn Oklahoma they know that brother CLA and them if you're 1/8 of a certain tribe of Indians out there if you're just 1/8 now that's a long way back you know 1/8 you can get your medical bills you can get all kind of things taken care of if you're just one 18 but see Israel thinks so much of it they want their people home but listen that's only the natural story David in the natural Story coming out of Egypt in the natural story don't you think that God looked down at those people and saw him righteous no no no now brother D saw what he doing well I reminds you that he when who was it bam or B one over there was trying to show God all the bad things and it said he showed them the hinder parts of Israel you know what that would mean the worst you could get right all right and the prophet said I can't see nothing is I can't see anything cuz that's the way God looks at it now we're going to start looking at things the way God looks at it and that's what I've been driving at amen if we have the new birth why can't we believe that by the new birth that he has given us that we're just as righteous as God is but now see that's where we fallen again see we're not going to take that we're righteous but we're going to still say we're saved so you got the bumper stickers I'm not I'm not perfect I'm just saved well when are you going to get perfect well when I get over there H you see what I'm doing we must get in our mind that by salvation brings a Healer within us and makes us just as righteous as he is right now if you don't then you're downgrading one of the compound names right well I've heard this over and over so I can put together the banner I'll just lay out well okay that's all right that's your business I thought about doing something the other day and you know I'm I'm kind of arrogant old guy when I do say things I guess but I thought about writing out a thing and just applying for a job and each one of you being the boss and I thought about writing out my res what you call that big old word resume you know we call it the south of Rumi a resume and give each one of you my resume and see if you would hire me to work in your company and write out all the things that I do and don't do and how many times I'm out and why I'm out and what's going on and would you me if I was going to miss 36 days in one year you know okay I'll get off of it listen folks this is not a play pry why were you so dedicated back in years ago but you're not now what's wrong but yet you still think you're just as much now see I can take the other side of the righteousness because I got them laying in my office of how that if we turn the righteousness of God in the wrong direction do you know that if we turn the righteousness of God in the wrong direction he does not have to hear our prayers that's that's Bible you know have to hear our prayers that's right well I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and they don't hear me maybe it's because we've turned from our the righteousness of God that's right I try not to be hateful I write out things but then I put them up and Don't Preach to you you think I'm but I try my best to get you to see something about his righteousness yeah but brother so and so preach righteousness and I just feel so good that's you what's the difference in the word you know if I say righteousness or I say righteousness what's the difference in the way the word comes out but listen see it's a promise now in the Bible that God will one day Reign Over Israel and that's what he's saying here in Jeremiah and you go over Jeremiah 33:16 and you'll find the same repeat that he's telling Israel one one day you will be drawn back to the Homeland and when you do now this is kind them all together when you do there'll be a Banner written prob get there today but there'll be a banner stretched out over what does it say if you was a Jew and you done what I said and they send you the money they send you everything they send you a free ticket and all the brother said and you landed Israel and there's a sign that says welcome well everybody no it means special to them cuz everybody ain't going to walk past that word welcome and reach and get in their hands their citizenship that's and become an automatic citizen with all rights of Israel that moment he'll be the banner that's what we we'll get on over okay but you see it take the millennial Reign to really bring his righteousness into the correct order cuz that's the promise to David that his son would sit on his throne that's why he becomes the son of David in the millennial rign all right now but doing that it's promised to David that his son that's not going to be Solomon in the Millennium right who is it going to be Jesus right but you know what he's going to be when we get there said why he be the son of David no it be the Lord our righteousness right that'll be his title the Lord our righteousness Jesus is our righteousness we got any at all and he's going to be king now turn over to Hebrews right where you were with the reading the eight one go back to 72 71 why you turning there for this MDC king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation what king of righteousness and after that he's also king of Salem which is Jerusalem and he's king of Peace So in the Millennium he's going to have a Banner written across him what the Lord our righteousness the Lord our righteousness Jehovah tiin you but you see now here's your prophet he said now he is now King of the Saints now we don't have to wait till the headstone comes for him to be king you don't get some thought in your mind like that one of these days head we'll be no no he's king of saints by the new birth he is our king and you know what that makes us us his children that's right we're the Sons and Daughters of a king go to the Book of Revelations read where that it'll be Kings and Priests amen we're not only at this day by the new birth Kings and going to rule with him in the Millennium come on is your Prophet that way brought but he's already king of saints he's already our righteousness amen but when are we going to start confessing it that we're just as righteous as he is by the new birth yes but brother Dale I I do so many things wrong now you're putting it upon some form just like you're putting your head healing upon some form but yet you're not putting your salvation you will say I am saved if you're saved you're perfect if you're saved you're righteous amen I just can't see you're looking at what's out here that's right right you're looking at your body and your spirit of a human being that will have mortal problems as long as we live but when are we going to say what he says oh we're good to say I'm saved let me say what God said I'm saved let me say well God this we do that all the time right right but then you say well you're just as righteous as he is by that same salvation that you have within your soul you're just as righteous as it is now you tell me how you going to make it any other way cuz see I'm talking about an inside man amen and we're going to see this it comes out into the outside man your salvation is inside right it's in your soul right but it displays outwardly okay your healing is in your soul that's where the Healer at but it's displayed outwardly when we accept it and believe it that's why it comes like that there a click there something happens and we're healed well see the righteousness in me I have no righteousness my savior is the one that's righteous that's right but you know what he says back to me come on is that Ro is it Romans we're supposed to confess with our mouth believe with our heart that we saved well is it right according to the scripture that we're supposed to confess and believe well is it right that we're supposed to confess that we're just as righteous as he is yeah but now how can we human mors be righteous God said it that's right you want to call him a liar he's one that said we righteous but you see what I'm trying my best to do is to drive the point within you and me to where we either find out we're saved or find out we're lost that's right because we find out we're saved Hallelujah we find out we're lost we can do something about it it's not get up in heaven to find out whether we're saved or not that's right it's to find out here that's right right but you see the only way you can be saved is take what God says that's right the only way you can be right rightous perfect now is that what we were on that a few weeks ago if our righteousness the Bible says don't exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees because righteousness the definition of the word righteousness is living right that's what I was getting to a minute ago see he he gives us his righteousness and we live right and we do right do the best we can then we turn that righteousness into lasciviousness well it don't make no difference what I do cuz I'm saved anyway that proves you lost that's the best way I can say it when that thing start telling you like Sister Mary said the devil will begin to tell her oh that just like any other time just tell him you're a liar that's right you're a liar that's right I thank God for everything I drop a screw on the ground and some I find it I say thank you Lord for finding you know what the devil said the other day he said I was want to help you find it I said you didn't do it I SAR told us she didn't do it talk to him it's like you talk but you understand what I'm saying I'm trying to put it together in a form where we can understand Israel has promised that one day they will come to a millennial Reign and at that day then it will be understood by Israel who the real righteous one really is and he sits there as their savior they're all in all and they'll realize that he's King you remember in the tribulation they said where'd you get the nail prints he said I got him in the house of my friends can we say What God Says see but we immediately when we say we're righteous what happens 49 Quotes come up on your computer brain right don't be that look what you done well you know it's not based on what I done that's right amen all right I done preach that so don't worry about it I done preach if we say we're not s we didn't do it and we did do it then we're proven we're lost CU we're a bunch of liars right how much more do I need to preach on it you don't condemn me to sin well there's something wrong with you you're lost I was thinking about a brother the other day all i' made was one point to a brother and offended him and he left and I don't feel that I've got to go apologize cuz I told him the truth I said whether you're saved or not you'll prove it that's right he did he left he said you saying I'm not saved I said I didn't say that I said you're going to prove whether you're saved or not that's right and you know our actions is going to prove what we are we're going to prove whether we're lost or we're going to prove whether we're saved but do you understand see see he is now our King yes we don't have to wait till a millennial Reign to see him as king the day you're born again he became your king he became your head cuz he's the head of the church now I don't have to wait till the headstone comes for you to be the head that's just the headstone coming into full manifestation amen right right see that's not another New Birth right that's not accepting him in a king in a different way no no you just realize who he is king of righteousness and by being that that makes him the king of the saints that makes him Paul said the king of peace now we got the other one to get on on that right Jehovah Shalom you see what I'm trying to do yes take the word of God let's read that word of God take the prophet's message put it together to see that we don't have to wait until the time comes we can see that he already is our righteousness sir he already is our healer he already is our savior he's already our righteousness I'm not confessing how righteous I am that's right that's right cuz I know I'm not amen he's done told me I'm not that's right I got plenty other people tells me I'm not too but he done told me I'm not but you see when I confess his righteousness then he has to take my confession right right are you listening yes he takes my confession My Confession must be according to his confession so I confess that he's my righteousness he confesses that I'm righteous that's right amen see but if you go around confessing that I'm weak then God has to say you're weak when you go around saying you're sick then God has to say you're sick when you go around saying if you're lost then God has to say you're lost so then what are we doing we're confessing ourselves either into the right thing or out of that's right amen that's Jehovah tiing you the Lord our righteousness it didn't say there now listen I'm trying to get this to a point it didn't say there in Jeremiah the Lord is righteous they didn't say that right they said the Lord our righteousness we know he's righteous right but see when he said the Lord I righteous means that righteousness has been imparted it means it's been transferred from him to you and me amen amen now why can't we say I'm just as perfect as he is right was life in the other day in the paper it had maybe some of you read it and it had a thing that over in England or something they was going to give the poor people money you know I'm just putting it in and you know what the queen when over she wanted to get the money of course that won't be talked about no more you know shut all that up but she want you know she's poor she could show you on the records that where they was you know they running out of money but you understand they we're easily and quick you know to accept our our General Motors retirement right we're easy and quick to accept our social security you know and all of that the only one that I don't want is the $250 check you get and you die cuz I don't want that one cuz that's all you going to get from your Social Security it's 250 bucks now that's going to bury you is it that won't even cremate you that won't even build a bonfire but my point what is it you know what you got to do to be able to get General Motors retirement what is you got to do you not only got to prove who you are you got to confess who you are cuz if you go down there and lay down the papers brother collie take his papers in and lay it down there the sign you know James call birth certificate they say this is you and I'm not say well who is this no no no no no no no we say that that's me like I used to do when I was early years I had to go cuz we had a family bible didn't even know I had a birth certificate found out it did but we had a family Bible and there was 13 of us and I'm the baby of 13 and I'd lay that down that I did to get my driver's license and they said it's good I mean CU they'll accept that quicker now they will a birth certificate I that's truthful they'll accept a family bible now quicker they will burst they'll accept the fact that you've been baptized somewhere and a record's been made of your baptism quicker they'll accept your birth certificate right now but see they would say well which one are you I said no problem I just pointed the bottom I said the baby of the crowd well see if I had to confess that what would I got well which one's you we want to give driver's license to one of these 13 we're not going to give all 13 right do you get the point we must confess that we're righteous we know how now and we know our lives don't have anything to do with it if we're you're doing sin we're lost that's blunt plain we're lost but we're doing the best we can do humanly possible and then depending upon his righteousness well now that puts Works in it I put it to you before and I don't mind it you're not saved by works no sery you're saved by grace through faith but once you get born again you reach a conditional situation that says You must repent of what you do wrong if you don't you're going to have to answer to God somewhere now that's the Bible in your prophet's message that's right so which one we going to confess we're going to have to say who we are right we're children of God we can say that pretty easy right I mean that's that's pretty easy to say I'm a Child of God as I was saying about the queen you know that when them children are born that they're born royalty right that's royalty born royalty they think so much of that we were talking a while ago and I'll be glad to find you the article it's in U National Geographics about how King Tut and some of them were deformed they've proved they were you know why because they had a lot of incest in the king's lineage you know why cuz they didn't want the money to spread nowhere else they wanted to keep it in the family so they had a a lot of incest and they believe by the incest you know of having children by their own children you know people out on the internet make you know I understand the word but I mean my language you might miss what I'm talking about there was a lot of kids born because that brother and sister got together and Daddy and the daughters got together you know what they doing they're trying to keep the lineage and they believed that it made a superior lineage but instead of that it made kids that was deformed they've proven that a lot of them were highly deformed but yet they kept doing it because they believed it was a doctrinal thing but listen when that child is born over there to that royalty it automatically becomes royalty I remember brother Brady and him telling about how that Queen and all you know when the next one is in line to go up to every what to be the queen or The King and I know this in the marriage and whatever the Kings and thing but whoever's next in line you know that they they take them when they're little they say like a daughter say Olivia there with be the next one in line to be you know to the throne you know that all of her life she's trained she didn't get to live on her own she doesn't get to go out in the rest of the world she's trained and trained and trained to walk a certain way to act a certain way to dress a certain way to talk a certain way all of her life she's trained and that Queen would come over there and stay where brother bra then was had you know what she she' do she wanted to be normal she'd sneak out at night and go downtown and the security guards was mad about it but she'd slip out and go you know what she'd tell sister Brady she' tell a servant I said don't you bathe that baby anymore in the morning I want to bathe it cuz see she didn't get to live like the rest of them she was set aside well folks why can't we believe that we are the children of almighty God set aside for a purpose in there this end time to not be like everybody else that's right that's right amen but to be the Sons and Daughters of a living God to believe what God has said about us he says we're righteous they didn't go ask the queen did you sneak around downtown that didn't make her where you wouldn't Queen God don't look at what you and I do what we do don't do don't have anything to do with it you said not just all twisted up will Heaven help you to understand the truth he is my righteousness I don't have any but let me say what he says now to end it all up how many of you treat your kids if kids good then you treat them good right now come on now Danny there you I know he does cuz he pets hope like everything anyway but but do you pet hope and and run Jacob out no no you don't do that now Jacob's a good guy that's reason I can use him he's great kid I love Jacob he's a good boy but now what if he wasn't a good boy would that make him less your child would you treat him less or different you asked June and you asked Lisa they were girls out in the world that come into this and married into our family but I never treated them any different if they come to our house with their pants on and their things they W they come into our house they knew what we believed and you know it wasn't long till they started just respecting that you know why because we didn't screaming harder at them now if we just scream hard at him get out of here go put on some clothes and act like no we didn't they Tre no different because if they're married our children they become our our Offspring because the Bible says the two become one so if you can't believe your Offspring you got a problem I treat my kids good but I just can't treat yeah you're not serving like God God treats his children the same right CU they're his children I love that story where the king come in you know and the man killed the King's son and the King come in and he said when the son when the man told him said I'm sorry in a fit of rage I just killed your son and I'm sorry I deserve what I'm getting he walked outside he said destroy all the records make him righteous go in there and shave him up and clean him up I'll be back when he came back he didn't come and say get in here I'm going to do it now he rolled out a red carpet he said you killed my son but all the records are destroyed I've told you what I believe on that you know what in the story you're not getting it if you just say all the records is destroyed about what the guy done now he said now you're my son you know what happened all the records of his son was destroyed and there stood his son you say that's impossible what's impossible with a man of God is easy to do we kill Jesus Christ and God said okay I'll just make you my son I'll make you just as righteous as I am how long was it about 6 months ago when I was trying to preach about the the uh uh like you're worshiping idols and then coming in worshiping God and to seeing that he paid the price come on come on musicians he paid the price we don't have to pay no price we just accept what he's done but then why can't we say what he says why can't we say What God Says About Us see there must be something wrong with the way we're thinking maybe we're thinking that we are saved but we're not righteous now how can that be if you're saved you're righteous what else can it be if you're saved you're healed what else can it be Jehovah the Lord our righteousness don't have any of our own he's our righteousness let's Stand Together 34 the red book 3:14 anybody have a need sing it this way it says God sent a son but singing as God came as a son
