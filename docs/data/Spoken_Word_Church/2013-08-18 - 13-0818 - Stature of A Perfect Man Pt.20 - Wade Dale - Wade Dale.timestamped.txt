[0:01] okay didn't have brother Danny with us
[0:04] from the Philippines he's going to be
[0:05] speaking for us today
[0:07] and
[0:10] we've had a delegation of
[0:13] of island of the Filipinos for a week or
[0:16] so so
[0:17] we uh enjoy them being around us because
[0:20] they're they're great people
[0:22] I always thought that
[0:24] we were talking together Friday night
[0:27] I told him that brother Toriano I
[0:29] thought he was always the serious one
[0:31] because he always got a serious look on
[0:32] his face and brother Danny he said
[0:34] brother if you see a Filipino with a
[0:37] serious look on his face
[0:40] what'd you say
[0:41] yes
[0:43] he's just kidding
[0:47] so he's just kidding
[0:50] no no we've had a blast my I've laughed
[0:53] Joel foreign
[1:07] all right
[1:08] well Hebrews 11. now we were we were
[1:12] beginning
[1:13] to
[1:16] discuss a few things last Sunday
[1:19] about by faith so faith is a revelation
[1:23] right so in the Statue of perfect man
[1:25] that's why we're taking so long with
[1:27] this Foundation of faith is because
[1:30] it is the very Foundation of
[1:32] Christianity
[1:33] you you must have faith in something
[1:37] that you've never seen in your life
[1:41] show me the new birth
[1:42] show me your new birth
[1:46] we as human beings we like to see things
[1:49] right okay but Hebrews 11 starts off
[1:52] telling you one thing's for sure
[1:54] faith is the substance of things that
[1:56] hope for the evidence of things you've
[1:58] never seen
[2:00] I mean we we see these things that uh
[2:02] there's a man that's in the Philippines
[2:04] that he uh
[2:07] um
[2:08] acts after crucifixion they actually
[2:11] nail nails in his hands but if they need
[2:14] them said yeah every year they may
[2:15] actually nail nails in his hands put him
[2:17] on a cross for a certain length of time
[2:19] well see that doesn't even prove to me
[2:21] that Jesus Christ was was crucified but
[2:25] I have to believe by faith
[2:28] that he was and then that faith that I
[2:31] have speaks back and says that's exactly
[2:33] correct
[2:34] and then the Bible was written
[2:36] for our admonition
[2:38] for us to learn and study and to see
[2:42] what God's already done for us
[2:45] he's already done it he does it he
[2:48] reveals it and then he makes it manifest
[2:49] so God done it before the foundation of
[2:52] the world
[2:53] he's revealing it to us now
[2:55] I was thinking about this morning
[2:58] um
[2:58] is that eating cereal I don't know why
[3:00] sometimes stuff comes from me eating
[3:01] cereal or riding the lawnmower so I
[3:03] don't know where it comes from but
[3:06] but you you look at people and you see
[3:08] that
[3:10] faith has to really come by hearing
[3:16] and then you have to rent that what's
[3:19] inside of you has the ring back to that
[3:23] right it has to ring back because
[3:26] she takes feel smelling here
[3:29] can be deceivable
[3:33] but watch the Providence of God
[3:36] you know we say we're in the day of the
[3:38] open book which is correct Christ came
[3:40] down through a prophet and opened the
[3:42] book to us well even in the closed book
[3:44] that's what I'm thinking about this
[3:45] morning even during the time of the
[3:47] closed book
[3:49] God took a bride
[3:52] right
[3:54] God took abroad even in the closed book
[3:56] we say the clothes even even Luther's
[3:58] little lion and Wesley's little light
[3:59] God was pleased with those people why
[4:02] because they believed Luther one day
[4:05] said that just shall live by what faith
[4:09] not by work not by Penance not by
[4:11] crawling on your hands and knees brother
[4:12] Danny sees that a lot over in the
[4:14] Philippines they do pennants and stuff
[4:16] like that because there's a lot of
[4:17] Catholics over there
[4:18] and then this this guy that hangs on the
[4:21] cross he may think he's going to heaven
[4:23] just because well he could be the
[4:24] biggest Senator than ever
[4:27] he's not born again he's not a child of
[4:29] God
[4:30] okay so he's just doing that as penance
[4:33] and then you see the people that beat
[4:35] themselves with the the like the Canon
[4:38] Tales you know Daddy was telling about
[4:39] blood blood splatter and everywhere
[4:41] that's not an act they actually do that
[4:43] well they think they're appeasing God
[4:46] well Luther walks out one day and says
[4:49] no
[4:51] the just are the people that are
[4:53] Justified have to live by faith
[4:56] not by that but now by the faith you
[4:59] have we'll show your works
[5:02] don't forget that remember
[5:04] Works without faith faith without works
[5:07] they work together
[5:09] but to have substance Faith which is the
[5:12] bottom of that pyramid that means that
[5:14] God has actually come to you in the New
[5:16] Birth and give you a part of himself
[5:21] actual substance
[5:23] it's like brother brother uh Soriano
[5:25] we'll talk about Wednesday night it's
[5:27] not just a spirit
[5:29] sure God is a spirit
[5:32] but he's in spirit form
[5:34] but he's in you
[5:36] and he's not like Casper the Friendly
[5:38] Ghost
[5:39] he has a form he's a man
[5:42] he's actually a person because he is the
[5:45] personality of almighty God because that
[5:48] right there is the personality of
[5:50] almighty God
[5:51] the statue of perfect man is the
[5:53] personality of God himself
[5:56] okay because when Jesus came on Earth he
[5:58] didn't act any different than the father
[6:01] why because he was the father made
[6:03] manifest in another form
[6:05] so what about you and I
[6:07] we think here's Jesus here's brother
[6:09] Branham and here's us
[6:12] well now Jesus was virgin born that sets
[6:14] him apart but now the same holy ghost
[6:17] that William Branham has the same holy
[6:18] ghost that I have
[6:22] I choose whether to let it work
[6:27] come on
[6:28] we're free moral agents brother Brown
[6:31] said the Holy Ghost is very timid why
[6:33] would a Prophet come and talk about the
[6:35] Holy Ghost as an actual person give me
[6:36] my personality
[6:39] you know all the other denominations
[6:40] that go well we hope that we live a good
[6:42] life and we hope that that we'll meet
[6:44] something later on in Life or right at
[6:47] our death or after our death we'll meet
[6:48] our our theophany
[6:52] well when God comes to you if Jesus if
[6:55] we bypass our theophany like he was
[6:57] talking about Wednesday night if we
[6:58] bypassed it and he came with it which
[7:01] was just what so
[7:03] so when brother Brown said his soul came
[7:05] back on the day of Pentecost in the
[7:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost there's the
[7:08] theophany in 120 people
[7:11] so that's theophany we're going to look
[7:13] for
[7:14] you know the Bible says we've got a body
[7:17] waiting in heaven well what is heaven
[7:20] well Graham said heaven was a word
[7:23] there is a literal place called heaven
[7:25] but you know what heaven will pass away
[7:29] Heaven and Earth will pass away we're
[7:32] going to live down here
[7:36] but if you have any questions you can
[7:38] just stop and this is just kind of open
[7:40] discussion
[7:49] you don't have a whole bunch
[7:51] no no everybody can have the same to the
[7:55] office sure that's why it would make you
[7:59] a son and daughter of God I act like a
[8:02] devil because I'm a Dale but parents and
[8:04] I have different traits because of our
[8:07] Humanity
[8:09] but inside if he disagrees with the word
[8:13] and I agree with the word then he and I
[8:15] are not of the same family
[8:16] it all comes back to the word right here
[8:19] this word is where your body is being
[8:21] built right
[8:22] right you glorified bodies being built
[8:24] around your born-again experience well
[8:26] where's your Born Again experience out
[8:27] there somewhere no it's right here
[8:30] I don't have a body
[8:32] come on I don't have a body hanging up
[8:34] somewhere in the closet that I'm going
[8:36] to
[8:37] I'm gonna step this theophany not with
[8:40] this this over into another dimension
[8:42] correct okay everybody understand what
[8:44] I'm saying this Glory my glorified
[8:46] body's coming later
[8:48] Jesus is the only one who's on the
[8:50] glorified body everybody understand that
[8:51] say amen amen Jesus is the only one
[8:54] right now with a glorified body he is
[8:55] the only one that has reached
[8:56] immortality which means one time he was
[8:58] Immortal and now he's immortal
[9:03] I don't care he will explain anything I
[9:06] can't explain it not going to it
[9:08] because the Bible says there's only one
[9:10] person reaps immortality that means he
[9:12] was Immortal he died he resurrected and
[9:14] became Immortal nobody else has been
[9:16] that way or the Bible is wrong okay
[9:20] so they are waiting in that sixth
[9:23] dimension in their theophany
[9:26] which is the Holy Ghost brother Brown
[9:28] said all these people browned he said no
[9:31] he said well what is this the angel told
[9:33] him said this is perfect love well
[9:35] there's only one common denominator
[9:38] remember they were black-headed
[9:39] redheaded women
[9:42] right
[9:44] but they all had one thing in common
[9:46] they had a new birth when they were
[9:47] alive here on the earth they had the new
[9:49] birth
[9:52] Dimension is that theophany of God that
[9:55] Genesis 1 26-27 and it's waiting
[9:58] on you and I
[10:00] to whip the Redemption of this body
[10:03] not another one right
[10:06] or that would be replacement this is
[10:08] redemption
[10:09] brother Brown said if I die go to the
[10:11] Grave
[10:12] he said my spirit goes to God who gave
[10:14] it Soul goes into the sixth Dimension at
[10:17] the Resurrection The Soul picks up the
[10:19] spirit comes back into that same body
[10:21] and resurrects now you're not going to
[10:23] go out here to the graveyard and you're
[10:24] not going to see
[10:25] Graves dug up
[10:28] it's a secret catching away
[10:31] but somehow you say somehow well Jesus
[10:34] walked through a wall in his glorified
[10:36] body and then a fish
[10:38] right it didn't fall through him he had
[10:40] substance
[10:42] that's the glorified condition we've not
[10:45] made that yet
[10:47] but we're sitting in Heavenly places
[10:48] what is Heavenly place in heaven it to
[10:51] me when the to me when the Bible talks
[10:52] about heaven I think about the word
[10:54] because I'm not in heaven
[10:57] I may be Heavenly places
[11:00] we're in Heavenly places at the Statue
[11:02] of a perfect man that's Heavenly places
[11:04] but then we grow in Grace and knowledge
[11:07] we got everything we need for our
[11:08] journey
[11:12] I talked so long I forgot you forgotten
[11:14] what she's going to ask you're my you're
[11:17] remembering the man raise your hand back
[11:18] up
[11:19] but does everybody understand that
[11:22] we're talking about a real thing here
[11:28] here
[11:30] everybody had a hope of eternal life
[11:33] when brother Brown came and that book
[11:35] opened I believe he saw eternal life
[11:38] right here
[11:39] because this is where we're gonna live
[11:42] we're not going somewhere else God saw
[11:44] the city coming down brother Brown said
[11:46] on a redeemed entire Earth
[11:49] this Earth
[11:51] like he doesn't annihilate you at the
[11:53] new birth he burns you over
[11:56] kills the old nature
[11:58] we don't believe in Two Souls where you
[12:00] got one here and one will be under and
[12:01] you get this one you get that note once
[12:03] off brother Brown said I don't believe
[12:04] in transmigration of Soul right which
[12:07] means my soul could go over in his body
[12:09] or my Soca Gore in another body see that
[12:11] does away with all that if you take the
[12:13] whole message
[12:15] the whole message if I died today
[12:18] and I fell on the ground you're not
[12:21] gonna have to open the door for my soul
[12:22] to get out
[12:24] it it goes over into another dimension
[12:27] because brother Brown said it's faster
[12:30] it's faster so if it's faster it steps
[12:32] over into another dimension this can't
[12:34] go because it's not glorified yet okay
[12:36] right but the Inside Man is if you're
[12:39] born again there's the theophany there's
[12:42] not one there's not a coat hanging up in
[12:45] a closet somewhere right that's what I'm
[12:47] saying about this statue of a person man
[12:48] this is real and required now it's not
[12:50] required in the millennium
[12:53] it's required now that somebody come to
[12:56] a place of adoption
[12:59] where God thinks just as much of you in
[13:01] your flesh
[13:03] as he did Jesus
[13:05] because Jesus in his flesh on Mount
[13:07] Transfiguration sure he was transfigured
[13:09] sure his body's shown and all these
[13:12] great things but when he come down down
[13:14] off of that mountain he was just as
[13:15] human as he was when he went up on the
[13:17] mountain
[13:19] right he suffered he died he had to eat
[13:22] he was hungry he got a little ill
[13:25] he was still a man but he was almighty
[13:28] God in that man all right so everybody
[13:31] understand where we're going with this
[13:32] because you go but you got to believe
[13:34] this this is why I'm hanging so much
[13:36] this is uh
[13:38] part 20.
[13:41] trying to build a foundation we've had
[13:43] 20 many services just trying to get
[13:46] people to believe in faith to believe
[13:48] that you're born again to believe that
[13:50] God will do what he said he will do
[13:52] because if brother Brown said the Holy
[13:54] Ghost was a gentleman then guess what
[13:56] you grieve him he's going to go out on a
[13:58] whim now he's not going to come out you
[14:00] understand this is all for our
[14:03] illustration purposes
[14:05] right brother Danny was an English
[14:07] teacher
[14:08] you make illustrations to get people to
[14:10] see things better and the illustration
[14:12] brother Brandon made wasn't that the
[14:14] Holy Ghost was going to come out of you
[14:16] and go set out on a back porch somewhere
[14:19] no you know what you've done
[14:21] you just hindered it from working
[14:24] remember we were talking about the pill
[14:26] you take that capsule of pill inside
[14:29] there and if you take that that pill and
[14:31] pull it apart and what's inside there is
[14:34] what helps you the outside is not going
[14:36] to do you any good the outside just made
[14:38] out of Glycerin or or whatever it is
[14:40] glycolor but it's going to dissolve
[14:44] put in the right environment
[14:47] put it in the right environment you got
[14:49] to swallow the pill you can't lay the
[14:51] pillow down on the ground and say
[14:52] well that's that's gonna do me good
[14:54] that's really going to do me good and
[14:56] two weeks later you're still sitting
[14:57] you're gonna say well why didn't you
[14:59] take the pill while the doctor said that
[15:01] it would help me well you gotta take it
[15:04] put it in the right environment
[15:06] let the thing dissolve and then what's
[15:08] inside can help you same way with the
[15:11] new birth we were born in sin shaping an
[15:14] iniquity espousing our mothers when I'm
[15:15] a liar
[15:17] a capsule
[15:19] of corruption a capsule of sin
[15:23] a capsule of unbelief
[15:26] a capsule that is anti-word
[15:32] so that makes you born
[15:34] Antichrist
[15:37] I don't care who you are except for
[15:39] Jesus Christ remember he was born right
[15:41] that's what he was trying to tell
[15:42] Nicodemus Nicodemus was going back to
[15:44] the natural sex act
[15:46] do I have to go back in my mother's womb
[15:48] right Jesus said no no you got to be
[15:50] born from a love you got to be born from
[15:51] my daddy that's where the seed of life
[15:53] comes from is my dad the Father which is
[15:56] in heaven right
[15:57] which we know with any but same way with
[16:00] you and I that's what we don't
[16:01] understand we we try to pray to a god
[16:03] out there and uh I think a lot of times
[16:05] preachers think God's hard of hearing
[16:07] because they scream a lot
[16:12] Jesus never screamed
[16:15] one time in his life I don't believe he
[16:18] has support Lazarus he screamed but only
[16:22] one time but you know why he said that
[16:23] for him so that everybody wouldn't come
[16:26] up remember brother Ram said he had to
[16:28] shout Lazarus or everybody would have
[16:30] resurrected right all right but remember
[16:32] that that supreme power in control is
[16:34] not somebody shaking you or forcing you
[16:36] to do something or or trying to scream
[16:38] it out of you
[16:40] remember the demon said something to
[16:42] Jesus one time and he said go
[16:45] I don't believe he screamed at him he
[16:47] just didn't go
[16:48] why he was in control will it when you
[16:51] become a Son of God if you'll watch
[16:54] brother Brandon brother Brown never
[16:55] screamed it to people
[16:57] you're in those prayer lines it was it
[16:59] was real soft and calm
[17:01] and he'd even talk to the devil and he'd
[17:03] talk to him in a regular tone of voice
[17:06] he said come out of this woman Satan now
[17:09] if you're in the name of Jesus Christ
[17:10] you know what the power behind that
[17:12] voice it didn't have to be
[17:14] 100 decibels High
[17:16] but the power behind it like brother
[17:18] Brown said about the little boy little
[17:20] man with the with the badge in the gun
[17:22] waiting 90 pounds stopping the
[17:25] you know 600 000 pounds or sixty
[17:27] thousand pound train what he wasn't a
[17:30] man that could do it it was the power
[17:31] behind the man that could do it and
[17:33] that's why I think that we're so
[17:36] I don't want to say this wrong but we're
[17:38] so
[17:39] um
[17:41] Slack
[17:43] when it comes to the power of God but
[17:45] it's because you and I do it it's not
[17:47] because God's not powerful that's great
[17:49] it's because you and I are not believing
[17:51] enough
[17:55] the pills laying out here somewhere it's
[17:57] not in here we'll do you some good
[18:00] but that right there that statue of a
[18:02] perfect man is the key to the whole
[18:04] thing
[18:04] of getting us out of here
[18:07] nobody in the history of time has ever
[18:10] put that statue of perfect man together
[18:12] like the prophet did
[18:14] Peter said add to your faith virtue and
[18:16] your virtue and all is not you know he
[18:17] was telling the people but look what
[18:19] brother Branham did he actually brought
[18:21] it into a life
[18:23] paralleled it with the church ages and
[18:26] then showed that that Faith you receive
[18:28] the new birth and then there's a holy
[18:30] spirit baptism up there above brotherly
[18:32] kindness that has to come into the
[18:34] believer not that you receive the new
[18:36] birth at the top of the pyramid no no no
[18:39] Faith down there at the bottom is your
[18:41] new birth
[18:43] right thank you
[18:45] I don't see it any other way
[18:47] remember I'm pretty sure another day on
[18:49] glorified again well that's what he did
[18:51] he glorified you
[18:53] at the river
[18:55] and then he's going to glorify you again
[18:56] in a mountain that's what he did with
[18:58] Jesus he glorified him on he said this
[19:00] is my son who's my wife please to dwell
[19:02] he didn't say here he and him at the
[19:04] river he didn't say that to you he
[19:06] didn't give you the car keys to the car
[19:07] no you got on a tricycle
[19:11] you had baby Faith but then as you grow
[19:15] up when you get up on that mountain when
[19:17] Jesus stood on that mountain he said
[19:19] here you him
[19:21] in other words this is a man you're
[19:22] going to hear it from or the woman that
[19:24] you're going to hear from me because you
[19:25] sisters that's the statue of a perfect
[19:27] m-a-n not
[19:29] man gender-wise
[19:31] that's mankind
[19:32] so we had a Prophet come and show us how
[19:34] to do these things
[19:36] gave us a step by step and I believe the
[19:38] whole process that brother Branham went
[19:40] through
[19:41] was
[19:42] to
[19:45] forget to turn this thing on
[19:47] was to
[19:49] so they'll be listening to us listening
[19:52] to a solid page and watching them swim
[19:54] so anyway
[19:56] funny how things come to you right in
[19:58] the middle of something that I didn't
[20:00] turn this thing on so I've been
[20:02] adjusting it for nothing
[20:04] but Faith version all is temperance what
[20:07] that does that builds on your Holy Ghost
[20:10] experience okay that's the building that
[20:14] reservable was supposed to do what sweep
[20:16] off the foundation and start building
[20:19] the building
[20:20] and that's what brother Branham did he
[20:22] brought us
[20:23] to a place
[20:25] to where we could go up the building and
[20:29] he described the Holy Ghost as a person
[20:30] a person that was very timid why is he
[20:33] very timid because if you don't let him
[20:35] in one of the doors of your heart
[20:37] he's not going to burst his way in
[20:39] that's right he's going to say okay
[20:42] whatever you want to do it's your choice
[20:45] because you know what one day when you
[20:47] say well God I didn't have a lot of
[20:49] patience when I was when I was coming up
[20:52] through there he said well I tried to
[20:53] give you some and you didn't want it
[20:56] go ahead somebody raise them in oh I
[21:00] think that's why God chose the Gentiles
[21:02] rather than the Jews
[21:04] wanted him he's not going to force
[21:06] himself
[21:08] that's right and they believe by faith
[21:10] like the Centurion he believed by faith
[21:13] Jews have to see something yes laying on
[21:16] a man is a Jewish tradition but the
[21:19] Bible does say lay hands on the sick and
[21:21] then shall recover Nate don't say lands
[21:23] on the sick and and shake them and
[21:25] scream at them until no it says just lay
[21:27] hands on sick and they shall recover
[21:30] that stumps a lot of people because
[21:31] we've come through Pentecost and all
[21:33] these different denominations it says
[21:34] you guys screaming shake them and you
[21:37] know Ravel them that's not it
[21:40] we got to get people to start believing
[21:42] that that that's not it
[21:44] you know brother Brown said every time
[21:46] you go to the altar you get weaker
[21:48] what is that every time you go to that
[21:51] offer you get weaker because that's not
[21:54] a gentile tradition
[21:56] that's a Jewish tradition sure it's like
[21:59] a member of the clock we're talking the
[22:00] other day there are some churches that
[22:02] believe
[22:03] in that totally that you should never
[22:05] come up to the front never have an
[22:07] awkward call no now we don't believe
[22:08] that here that's right
[22:10] but now there are some that will believe
[22:13] and not have to have that
[22:16] the Centurion but there are some people
[22:18] that will have to have hands laid on
[22:19] them every Sunday to get something off
[22:22] of them or get so what big deal
[22:25] I mean it's in the Bible you can't take
[22:27] it out that's right it says laying hands
[22:29] on the sickness y'all recovered
[22:31] so we still do it
[22:33] but it should be coming up the statue of
[22:36] a perfect man to where you don't go up
[22:37] there as much as you used to go up there
[22:39] okay now that's your growth development
[22:41] as a Christian
[22:43] when I was first born again I was in the
[22:46] altar of life I had a lot to get off of
[22:48] me
[22:50] I have a lot I had a lot I had a lot of
[22:53] changing to do and I needed some help to
[22:55] do it but now when God gives you the new
[22:58] birth and he sells you into a place
[23:01] you just accept it by faith and then you
[23:04] see the things work out in your life you
[23:06] don't have to go to the altar but as
[23:08] Christians though we need each other
[23:09] it's not you don't go out there on them
[23:11] on an island somewhere and say well I
[23:13] don't need anybody no we need each
[23:14] other's strength that's what we're going
[23:16] to talk about Lord willing
[23:18] when I get back
[23:20] maybe we'll we won't be able to read
[23:22] this but see that's virtue
[23:26] it's all I don't have virtue like Peter
[23:28] did why not
[23:30] why do you like to come here and
[23:32] Converse
[23:33] or have conversation about the word of
[23:35] God and even about things of life
[23:37] because we can help each other in the
[23:38] things of life
[23:40] why because somebody
[23:43] has virtue
[23:45] You Must Believe brother Danny's got
[23:47] virtue today
[23:49] so that's where you're going to get your
[23:51] strength you're not going to get it from
[23:52] nobody else but him today God's going to
[23:55] use him as a conduit and right down
[23:56] through that conduit right to you it's
[23:59] where the word's coming for you today
[24:01] right that's right same thing with with
[24:04] brother Dale we believe he has virtue or
[24:07] we wouldn't come here
[24:09] because he's got something we can draw
[24:10] from he's got a bank that's got plenty
[24:12] of money in it that we can draw from or
[24:15] plenty of word in it that we can drop it
[24:17] right or we'd go somewhere out
[24:20] if you got a default bang you walk up to
[24:22] him all the time you say hey I got this
[24:24] thousand dollar check well we can't cash
[24:25] it because we don't have no money in the
[24:27] bank
[24:27] why would you keep going there
[24:30] and that's the same way where the Holy
[24:32] Ghost the Holy Ghost is timid
[24:35] the Holy Ghost program said you agree
[24:36] because the Bible says breathing off the
[24:38] holy spirit of God for by yourself
[24:40] for your seal until the day of your
[24:41] Redemption
[24:44] you're born again you're seal
[24:46] got it yes well sometimes I think you
[24:49] know brother clock and I were talking
[24:50] the other night
[24:52] the prodigal son was a son
[24:55] he wasn't the first cousin he wasn't a
[24:58] worker out in the field he was a son in
[25:00] the family
[25:01] and he went done something wrong now you
[25:04] say well well if he no it proved he was
[25:06] a son because he came back
[25:10] look at Adam
[25:14] was the son of God
[25:17] and sold out the whole human race
[25:22] sin
[25:24] in his flesh
[25:25] he let his flesh take over
[25:28] and he's sending his flesh like brother
[25:30] Brown said about the
[25:32] the preacher that said I'm not going to
[25:34] preach anymore and told black guys go
[25:36] buying some beer and and brother Brown
[25:39] said six months later he was dead
[25:40] because God took his child home so he
[25:44] went to Mars name so there's things that
[25:45] we can get in this thing and this part
[25:47] here that we can have the Holy Ghost and
[25:49] our soul
[25:51] and do things wrong but as we grow in
[25:53] Grace and knowledge it should be
[25:55] shedding some of those things off that's
[25:57] one of your walk if you look and say
[25:59] well I don't know more than I did six
[26:01] months ago you've got a problem
[26:05] you've got a problem brother they don't
[26:07] have a problem I don't have a problem
[26:09] you've got a problem and if I don't know
[26:11] no more I have a problem right
[26:15] so don't blame it on everybody else
[26:18] it's our own problem even with the new
[26:20] birth we're going to have plenty of
[26:22] problems but as we go up that statue of
[26:23] a perfect man
[26:25] virtue is strength
[26:28] I need strength
[26:30] you need strength because remember this
[26:34] still this adamic nature
[26:37] it's very strong because it lives in
[26:39] this condition of this world it came in
[26:42] sin so it's contrary this is contrary to
[26:45] God
[26:47] right but what's inside of it is God
[26:50] that's the Paradox
[26:53] you you see what I'm saying but you
[26:57] control whether you get virtue you
[27:01] control whether you get knowledge
[27:02] Temperance place it's all well per
[27:03] second man that's something that you do
[27:08] God's already got it there but it's
[27:10] something you do to either let it out
[27:13] let's see who that it's one of the two
[27:15] either open the door and let him in or
[27:17] keep the door closed
[27:19] right but it's your choice
[27:22] let's go upstairs and let brother Danny
[27:23] get ready but brother Joe will be
[27:26] speaking next Sunday
[27:28] and then the Sunday after that we'll be
[27:29] back and hopefully we'll start a little
[27:31] bit through faith and then into virtue
[27:33] thank you
[27:35] amen
[27:40] amen or old me one of the things
[27:56] okay
[28:26] okay
[28:55] on that
[29:09] you're doing that brother away thank you
[29:14] glad you're here too enjoy thank you
[29:30] everybody
[29:57] foreign
