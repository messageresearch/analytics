bibles now to hebrews we'll continue our thought from this morning hebrews 9 verse 11 and then we'll continue our thought on the eternal plan of redemption let's bow our heads the lord thank you today for this honor and privilege that we have of standing before your purchase possession lord it truly is an honor there's not another office in the world that we would be attached to lord except this one and that's to talk to your people about you father we pray that you'd be with each one lord the ones that are not here the ones that are sick the ones that all the requests have come in lord of the different ones uh bless brother donny's church there in tennessee lord they had to cancel their service today but lord we know you're the healer you're the one that takes all diseases as one there's nothing no bigger one or no little one to you lord cancer or any of those viruses lord they're nothing to you father we know where they came from they come from the devil and they're going back to the devil and lord you gave us a healing atonement that we can plead the blood of calvary that you took our stripes for us lord that we don't have to go through this well i pray lord that you would just cover us over with that lord and be with us lord during the furthermore this service forgive us of our many sins and mistakes that we make against you lord we ask your blessings in jesus name amen oh we need to uh brother colley said he wasn't feeling very good so let's buy our heads again i want he's coming in the door but dear lord we asked you that we were brother calling lord and he said he had some little issues with his stomach lord and cramping and different things lord we pray that in the name of jesus christ when he walks through that door back there just now that they'll be gone lord it's just the devil trying to keep him away from this service lord now we pray in jesus name that you'll condemn that thing lord in jesus name we ask you amen amen come on brother get up here for those of you that don't know brother colley's been with us as long as about as long as this building's been been here so um not saying he's old but he's been here a long time sorry brother dirty too so they're the they're the two they're the two pillars that like tarrant said it just really don't look like a service without them too sitting right there where they're at so we need elders we got we like the young people but we need elders to to tell us you know give us a something to reach for and brother colley and brother darling sure that we'd say that about you if you weren't even here so amen so but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle we're just family we're just family where's family members and that's what we talk about our family we our natural family probably worse than that but our spiritual family is really really good you okay okay all right all right if he says he's okay he's okay not made with hands that is to say not of this building and neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered him once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us so he had to obtain it like me and you i was sitting and praying for brother colley back in the back i was watching him holding his head and i thought man we have to press through this is the fight it ain't a picnic this is it we got to press through we press ourselves to the mark of the high calling we press ourselves brother you know you look at jesus christ he was the prince of peace right yes he said i don't bring peace but a sword and amen and we must press into the kingdom of god we must use that sword we're not that sword is not going to be set on our side the rest of our life we're going to have to use that sword which is the word of god we know that so in amos 3 verse 7 says surely the lord god will do nothing i hope we see that now we've known for us has been in the message for a while we've known this but it really hits home to me that that you really read this scripture he's just not going to do anything amen unless he reveals it to a prophet first if he can get it to a prophet he can get it to us and man because there had to be somebody to listen to that prophet now there's a lot that do not but there is a group of people that will listen to that prophet because the lion hath lord who will not fear the lord god has spoken who can but prophesy i read revelations 11 3 and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sackcloth and you can be seated and we'll read the other one thank sister freda for singing that song she had said she had it there and and about the stars in the hand but the bible tells us the mystery of the seven stars which i saw us in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars were the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou saw us are the seven churches so we're promised these things we know i'm going to fly through this pretty quick so we'll just keep your hand on the button back there because we're going to get to something um but yet this morning i had the background a little bit we had some um i knew there was some that had not been here in a while and they they um we just kind of background a little bit to uh i don't like to leave anybody out i don't like to leave people that come into the service and and don't know what you're talking about at least they get something when you background just a little bit and you know what background helps me too brother dale says sometimes he backs around too much well i don't think he back backgrounds too much i think he background enough to pick up because you know what it's the spirit of god doing the backing up it's not him he's like me he's wanting to just be he's wanting to get to the millennium or get to the future home but but god god knows more than we do so when we yield ourself we go back and and you know they send people in here that are that are i don't say not believers but they just hadn't been through a series or heard what was going on so you kind of have to back up to to pick them up and then slow ones like paul we'd have to do the same thing for him so uh i told you i was going to keep you awake so anyway so now we know that malachi came and restored all things it's okay and restored all things and turn the hearts of the children to the fathers i want us to understand and make sure we realize that it's turning us back it's turning our ideas back to the faith of the fathers not to the old testament not to a pentecostal message pentecost was good we don't throw pentecost out but we're not sitting under a pentecostal message where this one's going to jump up and speak in tongues and this one's going to interpret and you can't even preach so see what did the prophet to god he told even in some of those questions remember the question that that the prophet was covering was on tongues and interpretation well what if one's what if one prophesies what if one speaks in tongues and what if this one doesn't do this what if people were at because you know what they sent in services you served at one brother he said i've heard they get up and just start prophesying it's like popping popcorn they just start getting up and prophesying and you can't preach well see that's not what then brother brown says well the spirit of the prophet subject to the prophet all right well that took care of that and then he said i think last sunday or wednesday night he said now you may have the unction to do what you're doing but you can hold it you can hold it you can hold that and some of y'all's been holding a real long time because we we heard any tongues and interpretations in the church so maybe somebody let loose one day do you do that brother barry's church and i didn't think so now no shame i mean just saying that we're coming to a place though where we may need some of that we may need some of the tongue's interpretations and things like that because it's in the bible it's there for us to use amen and like brother brown said you lay in the you lay under the spout long enough you'll uh you'll begin to do those things but we're heading toward that we're heading towards something that i believe it's marvelous i believe it's something that we're going to press ourselves into and it's not going to be it's not see it's not going to be out of time you can press yourself into something and it'd not be time for it right and see that's what brother brown talks about doing trying to do god a service without it being god's will that's a wonderful message if you want to go listen to it or or read it it's trying to do god and start trying to do a god of service without it being the will of god you'll be out of the will of god so we've got to that's why that when we come up here and in the pulpit and when you're praying during the week they have to coincide they need to coincide with what you're praying for and what the preacher gets up and preaches they need to kind of get together and then it makes them it makes you listening better and it makes me preaching better or whoever's up here in the pulpit all of us come what expecting that god's going to what talk to you not talk to your neighbor but talk to you today you should be the only person sitting in the building because god's going to talk to you he's not he's not where he talks to this great big crowd he talks to individual people that's what we're talking about this this today about the gentiles he speaks to the gentiles sure as nations but he speaks individually by the new birth he speaks to each person individually and then we can have a gift of prophecy a gift of wisdom a gift of healing against all these different gifts of the nine spiritual gifts so if i get started on that i'll never get on this again so so now we look and pull the chart back up if you don't mind we got to a spot this morning that i wanted to get to but if you'll pull that back up and we see that we we talk about the church ages we have a bride we've got seven church ages something's got to happen at the end of that seventh church age because remember it's an event that happens but remember the seventh church age or the time element of the church age goes all the way through the millennium time element time does not cease until the future home all right so we're but we're going to be now that we are eternal people in our soul we must what we must transfer that into this guy because this is the time creature this is stuck in three dimensions this is not a spiritual being that you're looking at right here but you look inside of me is a spiritual being all right same way with you and god's talking to that spiritual being he's changing them first putting that person in heavenly places putting that person in actually not in this dimension amen your soul by the new birth has been raptured into heavenly places that you've already been raptured because you've been caught up but we're now we're waiting on what to wit the redemption of this body according to romans 8. but that didn't have that couldn't happen in any other church age because like i said this morning they were all upright operating under a closed book even even john saw the thunders but couldn't write them he just wrote the symbols he wrote just the symbols of the seals right jesus preached them in matthew 24 we didn't know that until the prophet of god came and the book became open and went once the book became open he preached the seals to us and then he takes us back to matthew 24 he said jesus has already preached them all right now we nobody ever knew that scholars didn't know that because the book was closed well now the book has been closed down through church ages now it has been open because of the ministry of what we were talking about this morning let's go to luke 17 verse 24 for the lightning that lighteth out of the one part of the earth or heaven shineth on the other part under heaven i'll let them get to it so shall although the son of man be in his day so we've got to see a son of man ministry come here and because he was through the seven church ages but right at the end now remember you and i are in that space of time right now of of trying to realize and and i don't say figure out because you can't figure out god but to realize that we're looking at judgment if we're not born again but we're also looking at we're all going to die physically if something doesn't happen according to luke 17 verse 24 going down to 26 as it was in the days of noah so shall be also on the days of the son of man then verse 30 said even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed it's always before destruction that the son of man comes on the scene and is being revealed all right so he's come not in the first church age first three four five six but in the seventh church age we had a prophet of god come restored us back to the faith of the fathers and then preached the opening of the seals the opening of the thunders and all the deep deep mysteries of god that's in the bible not out of the bible it's in the bible for you to read it's just sometimes we read the letter of the word and don't get the spirit of the word amen and that's what happened to man when they had all these other different denominational ideas is everybody okay with that but now remember when brother branham came on earth and he started his ministry it was in a healing process but remember he said that was just to catch the eye of the believer not in the years of preparation not in the healing ministry because listen that's not gonna change your body now it may temporarily give you a healing you go through the prayer line you get a temporary healing and then you might get sick brother abraham so you can get healed today and get sick tomorrow the same thing amen because it's a temporary healing it's not totally all the way a full resurrection let's just say it that way so when he when the prophet of god came on earth and he would tell the people their problems he would tell them where they've been tell them where they're going and tell them what's happening in their life oh i see you're a christian because you have a familiar spirit or i see this he was he was looking at the soul of the individual because he had to see where they'd been because he even had to see their thoughts sometimes he said oh you're thinking about a son you're thinking about your husband you're thinking about your wife he was right down in the deep part of the person and listen that's what's happening today if you'll let god talk to you not that william branham's here not that but the prophetic utterance that he left us because remember he told us we're prophetic people and we only are going to hear prophetic things amen little messiahs messiahs he made us so close but do we really believe that you better believe it because that's what this message this message is not here for the healing campaign there's been healing since the beginning of time but there's never been a body change like me and you are going to take it in a church age does everybody understand what i'm talking about enoch took a body change that that wasn't under a church age i'm talking about inside that church age somebody's going to stand on the earth as the prophet tells us and death is going to crawl up their sleeve and they're going to just wipe it right back off now when that happens the dead christ are going to rise because there's nothing to hold them the reason they don't come back into this time period it's like i've told you many times before why would you be in the sixth dimension eternal no taxes don't have to go to work on monday yeah hallelujah for those of y'all that work those y'all that don't you can remember that monday morning was always tough yeah monday's tough at the post office too because y'all's bills come in on sunday and we have to deliver them on monday but they don't have to worry about things like that some of you laugh because you have never mind so anyway they're in the sixth dimension why would they want to come back here why why come back into this miserable world well because one day they're going to feel a pull and that pull is going to bring them into this dimension because somebody's standing in this dimension that death has been destroyed from [Music] now you can take that as a fairy tale you can take out whatever you want but there will be someone that will not be part of a resurrection they will be the alive and remain everybody got that say amen first thessalonians 4 verse 13 if you'll pull that up please that's where we'll start but i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep asleep they're not dead they're more alive now than they've ever been that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord so in other words it's pretty it's been confirmed that we which are alive and remain now as paul was writing this he was part of the alive but now when he died he became part of that then with us are asleep so alive and remain unto the coming of the lord now when was the coming of the lord it's now i'm not talking about now remember they all oh the coming lord was 1963. now the coming of the lord started when you got born again whatever day that was it's going to culminate like i said before we're not looking for a rapture rapture rapture rapture rapture well it's not just going to we're going to pull up and go in the rapture right we've got to have a resurrection first we've got to have a body change next then we're going to take a rapture rapture is a culmination of all those things happening so what do we need to we need to we need to hone all of our efforts into getting the dead folks into this dimension because that's been destroyed in this dimension and you say i can't do that well we'll do your funeral and we may have to you might have to do mine but somebody is going to stand on this earth according to the bible and according to god sending us a prophet because he's not going to do anything until he sends us a profit so he's already sent that prophet we're ahead of the game buddy he's already sent us that prophet that prophet told us what was going to happen the bible's already told it was going to told us what's going to happen and it's in this time period that holds it way down the honing of the bride knowing who she is and what she's doing here not that we're gonna die by and by no somebody's gonna stay alive somebody's not gonna be a part of that having to go to sleep i don't want to say die but asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and the denominational world they're looking for hey they're looking for they're looking for an angel with wings usually girl angels ain't no girl angel who had to tell us that the prophet so if you believe one you've got to believe that one there's no there's no angels you know there was cherubs in the old testament that had wings right in ezekiel that was cherubims but regular angels don't have wings why they need wings for oh so they can fly yeah right so anyway that's this old wives tale that's what your mama told you your grandma told you that's what the world writes in a little book for you to read you know and it sounds so sweet and really nice that you got an angel there with wings you know but what is the shout the voice of the arcane we know that the prophet that god told us to shout was the message and the voice of the angel was the voice of the archangel the resurrection and with the trump of god we've heard not we've heard all this and the world's looking for it that's why this carry catching away is going to be so secret it's going to happen so quick they're not even going to know anything about it and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up there's the rapture will be caught up after the culmination of what change won't prevent them that get come up out of the ground the resurrection we'll read the next scripture talk about together we're going to be changed and caught up in the air be in the clouds to meet the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words so let's read the next one behold i what show you a mystery it's so much a mystery nobody knows about it but the bride god sent the message to the bride not to the church they have a message they say they're going to go through the tribulation they say they've got to stand before the for the white throne judgment right we're not that's not him in the bible but he took a prophet to tell us these things behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye look at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound what is a trumpet it's what a message yes it's something that is unique to you and me amen because there's all kind of sounds everywhere else what if you were on the battlefield back in the 1800s 1400s when they had no communication with with cell phones or anything like that they could be fighting one mile away and how in the world you're going to by the time you rode over there you'd have some disaster going on but if you had one guy with a strong voice and that trumpet made a certain sound and he hit that note they knew either the charge or to retreat and that's the same thing with me and you folks we've got to hear the certain sound of this message of the hour not all the other sounds that you hear for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible like i said last week pay attention to that because remember it had to be corruptible before it can be incorruptible and it shall be raised incorruptible people in the message believe you know or people in the world believe that that this one's never going to show back up again that we're just going to get a brand new one well that ain't true according to that now listen this won't be made new got it but it's going to be the same you that's redemption redemption is not replacement replacement is getting a new one but redemption is what bringing up that which had fallen and you can't be unless you this has got to connect or it should have said and the dead shall be raised with a brand new body it says raised incorruptable for this corruptable must put on incorruption in other words you're connected to it yes in other words it would just say well we're just going to go the store and buy another one right it's not you're connected and look aren't we mortal now you're mortal this mortal must put on immortality we shall be changed right here in this vile thing that your mama and daddy brought and it's dying even the ones that have already passed on they're going to bring their body up and it's going to be changed okay and it'll be new man 20 years old well some of your 20 year olds are rolling your eyes but but but that's that are a lot older than that yeah i'm looking forward to that part i was telling them ladies i'm i'm 61 years old and y'all are 12 and 14. so y'all we you'd really not i hope you drove did you drive down here oh because you're not 14. goodness but it's not hard for y'all to you think well body change you know i'm i'm feeling pretty good you where did you get my age you got all these other brothers and sisters get a little bit older we are looking for a body change we are looking for a body change because it it has to be a total resurrection for us to get out of the bed in the morning right feet get up we get up in shifts now but now listen on that resurrection morning that won't happen boy what a youth camp and it'll be a permanent one it won't be one that you go to and come back from no we'll all be young amen amen for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality he's telling us what we must do they'll be okay with that so the dead in christ shall rise in corruptable we shall be changed so what are we looking for first resurrection we're looking for death to be destroyed in a group of people in this time element in this dimension and that's going to draw them out of that sixth dimension which will be a resurrection not only of us brothers and sisters but every saint from paul all the way to right here boy what a draw you talking about a third pole everybody won't see a third pole that'll be the biggest pool you've ever seen in your life when all them dimensions started emptying up and the devil's going where they going no the devil's going where they been because see he can't get in the sixth dimension that's one place he can't deal with he can go talk to god for some reason in the seventh dimension he can go talk to god but in the sixth dimension he don't mess in that that ain't here that's just god's kids and god's kids alone what a mighty god we serve if brother johnny was here sister johnny was here she said what a mighty god we serve amen let's go what he preserved us even even in our inadequacy and even in our corrupt ability and all the different things that we are he's preserved us yes he's preserving if they pass on he's got them standing there waiting brother brown did not see dead corpse when he went to the sixth dimension he saw people that were happy people that were in the what the prime of life why are we why do we ever get afraid folks the only thing you better be afraid of is having a new birth or not having it amen so now we're looking for resurrection we're looking for then when the resurrection happens we're looking for a body change because remember we get changed after go back go back to 51. there you go behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in the moment twinkling of an eye and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed so the dead's got to come out of the ground even though standing here looking old but that voice of the resurrection is not old but when we're raised then what happens the prophet of god thank god for a prophet he said we'll be around here 30 or 40 days right like the lord jesus was 30-40 days and then we're going to be caught up which is the rapture after the resurrection after we get changed then we're going to have a culmination or a rapture or as the rapture the word rapture means ecstasy or or pinnacle or or you know something way up here that's going to happen because all these other things have happened right so that's why this you know us at the church we don't scream rapture rapture rapture no we need the voice of the resurrection somebody's going to have to preach the voice of the resurrection first then we shall be changed then we shall be caught up like in revelations 4 1 watch this excuse me revelations 4 1 after this after the church ages after everything's happened i looked and behold the door was opened in heaven thank god for the open door i had to have an open book before we have an open door and the first voice which i heard was that we're a trumpet see there's a they you see trumpet everywhere it's not that's not confusing that's a voice talking with me saying come up hither and i will show these things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne now that's to me that's truly we know that's the rapture of the church now after the church is raptured then god is going to go shift to the jews right we were covering that a little bit last week according to revelations 11 there's going to be two prophets come on the scene now but we need to talk about this first we need to look and see who goes in the rapture so let's go to matthew verse 25 and cover this right here there's wise virgins and foolish virgins then shall the kingdom of heaven be locking up to 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom now look they all 10 was looking for a bridegroom all right five of them weren't looking for a bridegroom and five not no all ten were looking for a bridegroom all right and five of them were wise and five of them were foolish now why were the five wives they had oil the five foolish ones did not that's we're going to get to that story they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil now what's oil oil is a type of the holy ghost all right they that were foolish took their land and they were in the words they took everything they needed except one thing one critical part was what what was it they had oil that's like a car with no gas useless but they had it but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept then all listen all ten arose at the same time they heard the same voice they didn't hear a different voice they all ten heard the same voice and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him in other words there was a cry or a message went forth told you what the bridegroom was saying go you out to me go you got to do something go to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps let me say a little bit about that they all wore their hair right and the dress right went to church listened to tape read the books watched the preacher prayed they trimmed their lamps they were getting ready to do something the foolish said unto the wise we missed one spot give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out they run out of oil they were justified they were sanctified because sanctified what cleaned and set aside for service they cleaned trimmed the lamp they cleaned everything up but they did not go on to receive the holy ghost now you know as well as i do that as brother richard was preaching sunday most of your foolish virgins are going to come out of this message because they're virgins they're not contaminated with that denominational stuff out there but what happened they said in a message church where the pastor told them well just believe that brother brown was a prophet and all you got to do is you know read one book and listen to two tapes a week and you're fine because they're foolish they had to be led by somebody that was foolish that's why i tell you we teach the baptism of the holy ghost in three stages you've got to be justified you've got to be sanctified a definite work of sanctification justification because you know what sanctification is sanctification makes you feel good makes you want to go to church the unclean spirit's gone out right according to luke the unclean spirit has left you and you're feeling good you're feeling religious you try to stay awake during the service i said try some don't try but you understand what i mean they're virgins though they think they've got it and they are clean as they can be right because they're foolish for their virgins but the wise have went on to purchase the oil i said purchase yeah you got to purchase the oil you got to want it more than the next guy besides you wants it you got to want it more than the store you get it from got it but listen that storeroom will never run out of oil the baptism of my holy ghost is for everybody it's just the ones that want it and the ones that don't give us your oil for our lamps are gone out we've tried to live this thing we've tried to not do this we've tried to not do that and that's your problem you tried to not do this and you tried you you took that one word and you took yourself out you tried let god do it because when that unclean spirit goes out of you walks in dry places seek his wrath find us none he's gonna come right back into your house and the bible doesn't say us even your house it says it's his house and finding it swept and garnished the tv's going out the door the dresses are down the men's not drinking and smoking he sees all that and he says hmm i think i'll give them a religious spirit if they want to go to church i'll let them go to church if they want to if they want to be a message believer go right ahead that's okay press play all you want to not according to the bible though they're not going all the way they're doing some of it they're doing some of it but the bible says in ephesians that he gave apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists for what they're perfecting knowing how to get your oil right and keep it lit so it won't go out amen but the wise answer is saying not so you've been sitting in church 13 14 years what's your problem lest there be not enough for us in you listen it's a personal experience with god you want to give the new birth to everybody you can but you can't give it to everybody that don't want it tell them and tell them and tell them lest there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell find you somebody that's got some oil that can sell it to you and buy it for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut remember that door was opened in heaven in revelations 4 they went up through the door well who shut the door on the ark god shut the door on the ark so god's going to shut the door on the gentile dispensation and these that were left out afterwards came the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you're not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh you see the dispensation he didn't say son of god he said the son of man dispensation is when this is going to all happen so if you don't get in that dispensation then you're going to be left everybody okay with that may be strong but you know what i'm sorry let's go to the can y'all pull up the 70 weeks of daniel's chart y'all stay with me today i know it's a little warm in here i had a cheeseburger today i'm okay all right let's go yeah there you go let's go to right here i know that look don't worry about brother bob just fill this thing full of good stuff and if you want one of them i guess they can send you one but brother bob just we just kept adding stuff it wasn't brother bob's fault but he just wanted to put this chart together but we're right here in the last church age right so what's going to happen is that we are going to take a rapture or a catching away or a wise virgin is going to leave this place and then what's going to happen is god's going to start dealing with the jews right i'm going to slow down just a minute god's gonna start dealing with the jews but he's not gonna ever deal with gentiles again got it the one i just read you here the wise virgin were all that was a gentile bride even the foolish virgin but remember they weren't bright they didn't get married because they didn't go with the bridegroom the bridegroom called but they someway did not become bride because they never were married because he said i knew you not everybody okay with that all right so now what's going to happen is is we're going to be caught up into another dimension and it's not so much up we're just going to step over into a faster dimension amen because that's where they're at now they're in a faster dimension okay the ones that went on they're going to come back into this dimension and then according to this chart according to the other chart two when we take a rapture then what happens is the tribulation is going to start the wrath of god is going to start on the world because it's a gentile world so god's going to start the tribulation on them first not the jews yet because he's got to go over there to the jews and he's got to preach to them three and a half years before the battle of armageddon he's got to preach three and a half years about 1260 days through the two prophets he's got to preach to them and while he preaches to them you and i are enjoying a marriage supper of three and a half years you know don't get tired of what we're gonna eat or where we're gonna be okay just please make it the menu will be given to you when you need it anyway matthew 24 verse 21 sometimes we get hung up on some things like that but i it doesn't matter to me we can have we're gonna have communion today maybe we'll just have communion for three and a half years it doesn't matter all right let's go to matthew 24 for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time now this is matthew 24 jesus is just getting finished preaching the seals hello matthew 24 you see all this 24 all the way through such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect sake that's me and you those days shall be shortened all right let's go to revelations 2 verse 20. see notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou suffereth that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication now he's not talking about natural this is spiritual fornication everybody got that and seduce my servants with to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and i give her a space to repent now this is in the church ages but what it's what he's prophesying and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her we're not talking about natural adultery we're talking about spiritual adultery we're talking about denominational ideas we're talking about something that's contrary to the word of god amen caster that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and we know that they do not all right matthew 17 because look when you say great tribulation listen tribulation worketh patience and we have tribulation in our own life but you will not ever go through the great tribulation because the great tribulation is the wrath of god and it will be because there's no listen what's keeping this world alive right now is the holy ghost that's inside you what's keeping this world halfway no attempt of sanity because the other nine tenths is not the tenth of sanity that's left what's not letting this world break into create into chaos is you and me because the holy ghost is on the earth protecting the bride but when she leaves there's only going to be 144 000 people that are born again everybody else is going to be what they're going to worship the beast whoa that's why you don't want to be here that's why i see the bride don't the bride don't go through that the church will because the church only went so far and didn't take the full word of god but the bride why would you let your bride go through tribulation oh we're going to wedding supper we're going to we're going to take you over to germany and put you in a concentration camp for our honeymoon now that would be a horrible husband right yeah god's not going to do that he's going to rapture us out of here and then he's going to let like i said all hell break loose here on earth amen because there's nothing to hold it back there's nothing to hold back the wrath of god except me and you sitting here today and all the bride around the world and after six days jesus took peter james and john his brother and bringeth him up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them his face did shine as the sun his rainbow was white as the light and behold there appearing to him moses and elias talking with him brother i'm talking about the second coming because dare stood jesus the second coming of christ and there goes there stands the two witnesses that he's going to let them go to israel and do what he's going to take the veil off of the eyes of the jews so that they'll accept because see they already they're already looking for this guy they asked jesus why must the last first come well malachi 4 says he got to come before the great and dreadful day of the lord the only problem is is they miss them comings of elijah so god's going to send them the spirit of elijah and they'll give them a bonus they're going to send moses over there and they're going to call 144 000. let's go to revelations 11 3 and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man hurt them fire now look fire they're not going to be like a flamethrower it's going to be the word that they preach and that's what's happening now flame of fire every time you hear the inspired word of god it's a flame of fire because what does it do it burns out what you've got problems with doesn't do anything to the outside person doesn't burn you on the outside burns your me on the inside and when i get burned on the inside it just makes the outside guy do the right thing that's just really simple and if any man will hurt them fire because see they got the holy ghost god's not going to send two prophets over there without the holy ghost amen so they're going to have the baptism of the holy ghost but now remember remember position they'll not be bribed god is going to promise to go pick up that 144 000 because he promised never to forget israel he's not going to leave her here he's going to give her that space of three and a half years listen thank god he didn't give us just three and a half years because we'd be so far behind how many years you've been here what if you just took the first three and a half years you were here we'd be here still i mean still next time in the next year and the next year and the next year but she's only going to give them three and a half years and they're gonna so know what's going on watch they have power to shut the heaven that it rained not in the days of their prophecy we know that's elijah have power over water turn them to blood and smite the earth with all plagues as often as he will we're going to read the sixth seal in a minute because brother brown tells us about the two prophets in the sixth seal when they shall have finished their testimony the beast is what the beast is going to pop up and kill them both there's going to be a special anointing on them because of the word of god for 1260 days they're going to prophesy nothing can touch them not a person not a man not an atomic bomb nothing can touch those two prophets i want a little bit of that anointing right now i want i don't want i don't want them to have it all i'd like to have a little bit of that now and when they shout and you too you should have it keep you awake and it's going to he's going to kill him so now let's go to daniel 12 7. i heard the man clothed in london which was upon the waters of the river when he had held up his hand right hand in his left hand he swear by him that liveth forever like i said wednesday night this is daniel is the book of revelations to the jews so this is the basically the same scene that's in revelations 10 7. it's just that remember when he raises his hand in revelation 10 7 time shall be no longer that's me and you but now remember israel has a certain length of time 1260 days that's all they got so it'll be that it shall be for a time times and a dividing of time three and a half years 260 days and when he shall accomp have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished and i heard but i understood not i said ah oh my lord what shall be the end of these things daniel's lord that's what 4 000 years ago almost and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed in a book now what happened when we come to the end time what happened to that book it got open so we can see what that prophecy is all about many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise what a promise but the wise shall understand amen the wise will understand go to 9 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city now remember in 70 weeks of daniel there's 70 weeks which is 490 years everybody i know some maybe not but that's okay we'll get to it maybe later again loot back over it again 70 weeks because a week a week equals seven years if you look in your bible in genesis jacob worked seven years for rachel and leah and he and it was it said fulfill her week so one week equals seven years so 70 weeks which is 490 years god is going to give them 490 years to repent and turn back to god everybody got that saying ma'am all right so now 483 years is already over with back then we'll get to that later so there's seven years left after the rapture because listen this can only happen after the rapture takes place because remember god don't deal with us and the jews at the same time that's right we're gone we're out of here and then god goes to them to to give them their redemption preaches three and a half years to do six things but look at the first three finish the transgression what do you do with you make an end of sin what'd he do to you make reconciliation for iniquity what did he do to you he justified you he sanctified you and he filled you with the holy ghost amen that's what they're going to get preached to in that three and a half years and then what's going to happen in the second part of the week is this right here brings in everlasting righteousness we'll get to that later self-division and prophecy and anoint the most holy because this is right at the millennium is going to start right here because it's going to take 74 weeks to bring israel back to their condition of redemption okay 70 weeks 490 years everybody got there all right so let's go to number three brother brown takes this in order then when the church is taken up moses and elijah appears in revelation 11 all right when the church now that's bride the bride you have to see what he's talking about remember that's 1953. it was 1963 when i said i now call you bride he knew the difference in the bride and the church because there's a difference in the bride in the church but you can use them listen a church can be a church a bride can be a church but the church can't be the bride yeah don't need to add that up again i don't know if i can say that again but do you understand what i mean church is the church the bride can be the church but the church can't be the bride all right which is just regular church which was the foolish virgins the ones that don't have the baptism of the holy ghost all right look moses elijah appears in revelation 11. and what preaches jesus christ to them and the holy spirit took from the gentiles now look it's not took away from us we're going out of here there's no more holy ghost for listen the prophet even tells it even the people are still going to go to church they're going to think they're getting the holy ghost why because the sanctification they think that's the holy ghost i'm sorry holy ghost took from the gentiles the rapture comes for the church or bride to be taken away and the jews that's left here will be preached for three and a half years because he said there'd be seventy weeks still determined on thy people messiah be cut off in between he's talking about the one week of messiah ministry three and a half years before that jesus preached and then three and a half he's going to preach to the two witnesses when he's taken away the gentiles will be given a place then they get three i need i need to read a little more they'll get three more years and a half to be preached to of jesus christ let's go to zechariah 12 verse 10. and i will pour it out upon the house of david with this that's jews and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem did in 70 weeks are determined to do what bring jews back and the city you got to have the jews and the city all right so in the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced who was that jesus christ and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one in his bitterness for his firstborn and that day shall should be a great morning in jerusalem as the morning of hadramanon in the valley of megiddon which is armageddon zechariah 13 verse 6 and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thine hands then he shall say those which i was wounded in the house of my prince their friends they're going to preach jesus christ so much three and a half years so they're going to realize they killed the messiah 2000 years ago and they're going to be in trouble but what did joseph say don't worry this was done to preserve you this was done to preserve life this was done in other words look this is what god's telling them this is done because i promised you i'd come back and get you i've already took the bride you missed that part but i've come back to get you because i promise i'll never forget you what a mighty god we serve all right revelations 6 verse 12 and now beheld when he had opened the sixth seal lo there was a great earthquake now remember we are not here when this happens because this is the great tribulation everybody got that we are not here but we got to show this the place where this is where the church has got to go through not the bride there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth sounds like kind of a nuclear thing doesn't it even as the fig trees catholics are untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it was rolled together y'all ever noticed when they set off a atomic bomb what happens look at the mushroom it rolls open right folks this we know one thing's for sure like i said again thank god for a prophet he said there would be no atomic bomb hit the earth until the bride's gone so you can whatever you want to say if you see an atomic bomb go off call brother dale he won't be there because we'll be gone but the heavens departed as a scroll and every mountain and island were moved out of their place wow every island every mountain and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able who shall be able to stand wow that's pretty tough so now let's go to the first chart not the day i'm saving the week sorry let's go to the first chart and we'll stop here in just a minute and take a communion okay so now where are we slide can you slide there you go we're almost getting to the future home all right the rapture all born again believers everybody see that all born-again believers going to rapture right here all right then there's three and a half there's 1260 days two prophets according to revelation 11 3 4 2 13. they're going to preach 1260 days and then what's going to happen now remember during this time right here is the tribulation period to the gentile world because those two prophets the bible says they can bend nature they can make this do this way well they're the cause of when the sixth seal opens brother brown said who opens the sixth seal the two prophets they'll open that seal by being able to call fire and all these different things because i want you to to think about something really quick and then we'll read a couple more quotes and stop because we stop right here we should be okay and we'll continue again because right here look when the rapture happens to us there's three and a half years tribulation is going to set in on the gentiles and the two prophets are going to preach to the jews and then what's going to happen when they get finished preaching they're going to die in other words 144 000 is going to be killed and so is the two witnesses are going to be killed and the bible says the whole world sees them so cnn's there fox news nbc abc cbs because them three them two guys tormented the world for 1260 days every time they try to kill what if you try to kill the bible says in the way that they try to kill them is the way they're going to be killed so they're going to send you know they're going to send the cia the fbi the fbla and all them other people over there i know what fbla is don't get i know it's future business leaders of america i know what that means but i'm just saying we're going to send all them llas and dvds and all them others over there what they're going to try to kill them because they hate them what if you tried for three and a half years to kill two people i'm talking about the whole world they're going to send everybody even israel is going to send them assad kgb and they can't kill them for three and a half years but when they do kill them though what's going to happen they're going to lay in the streets and what's going to happen they're going to resurrect right in front of everybody's eyes in front of the world they're going to have the cameras on them the whole time they'll cut away and say well we've finally we've got rid of these guys and they're going to do this we're going to leave them laying there look at them they're they're just they're bloating they're they're turning green they're you know you're not commentating and all of a sudden they're going to go back and go oh they've resurrected and then they're going to take a rapture but let me tell you something the difference between remember we'll cover in a minute but we're covering it later there's two battles and then we'll then we'll stop right here i'll read a few more but remember there's two battles everybody wake up just for a minute please two battles the battle of armageddon and the battle of gog and magog according to revelations 20 verse 9. now there is differences in these two battles and you need to understand both of them to when i keep going through here you'll understand what i'm talking about the bible of armageddon at armageddon is going to be a natural battle it's going to be nations against nation it's going to be this one against that one they're going to all confer converge on jerusalem and they're going to start punching buttons the battle of armageddon will be an atomic war now the battle of gog and magog is a spiritual war it's not a it's not an earthly battle and it's not a battle that's going to do this and that it's not going to rain fire down we read we read in the bible and many generations never saw nuclear war or what happened to it but remember in the battle of armageddon it says that man's flesh will come off of their body while they're still alive that's nuclear that's nuclear war that's that's the fallout and all the different things but now not with this battle this is going to be god and the devil and his spirits and god's going to have to get rid of them because remember the battle of armageddon doesn't kill satan the bell of armageddon doesn't kill his imps remember they're what bound for a thousand years they're right down underneath here and they can't do anything but they're gonna raise up just one more time but remember this battle that's coming up will be a nuclear battle a nuclear war between men because the prophet tells us man always destroys himself okay so let's read this right here just for a second revelation 7 verse 1 after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds now where the four winds wars all right holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom was given to hurt the earth and sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants now hold on you and i are not servants thank god for a prophet again we're children of god we're sons and daughters we're not servants so who is that look hurt not the earth neither the seed nor the trees now look all this is happening to the gentiles but over there in israel god's got to call out 144 000 in 1260 days and there's not all that chaos going on over there because he said hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads because this is you say well who i don't know who that is well you will right here and i heard the number now you're going to see numbers in the bible talks about multitudes nations ones that you can't number that's gentiles people nations people you can't you can't so so much of a number you can't number them but remember here israel has numbers and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed and hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel so who are they talking about that's talking about the two witnesses going over preaching uh redemption to the 144 000 and they are saved of the tribe of judah 12 000. reuben 12 000 gad 12 000 asher 12 000 neptulum 12 000 manasseh 12 000 simeon 12 000 levi 12 000 iscar 12 000 zebulun 12 000 joseph 12 000 of the tribal benjamin 12 000. if you add all them up you're going to get 144 000 every time amen so that's who they're talking about that's to the jews then hurt not to hurt not wherever they're at they're over there in israel now that's what gets me the biggest turmoil in the world is in israel and palestine and hamas and all that right they're just blowing each other up almost but during those three and a half years god's going to shift that thing out and the world is going to start destroying each other and it's going to then wind up in israel because israel's going to have to have three and a half years to preach to in not so much chaos because they got to hear they got to get together they got to hear the message all right now let's get this right here real quick and then we'll finish then we'll take communion communion and foot washing daniel 9 27 and he shall confirm now look bring up the daniel 70 weeks chart one more time before we everybody okay i know it's hot i know you're trying to go to sleep and you want to get out of here but this is important if it's not important you shouldn't come so the 70 weeks of daniel push it back over that way a little bit and i don't want it to be confusing so watch 70 weeks are determined all right everybody got that so there's a time it started and they got 490 years to save israel just to make it simple everybody got that all right so now bring it back this way a little bit so now jesus is right here he died right here on the cross i'm old i'm looking for these things fine so right here's calvary and thank you for making it bigger i'm just kidding but 62 and 7 is 69 so 69 weeks has already happened god look this is grace right here folks because listen without us this right here should be jammed in right here everybody got that that over there should be right here and when christ died if they would accepted him in the jewish realm there would have been no gentiles right but we've got grace now knowing that he had to put them away because they put him on the cross but we did we know that but they literally put him on the cross because they said let his blood be on us and our children and that's why god had to then chop it off right here give the gentile bride time to come in thank god that's me and you folks if not that would have been right here they would have took a rapture and it would have been millennium and been done with right but god give he separated because of grace and because of to get this bride out he had to cut them off right at calvary he started a gentile dispensation now remember that gentile dispensation is going to end so there's one more week left after the rapture to finish the 70 weeks of daniel from here to over here where it's not on the chart to bring it together to finish it everybody got that we were we we're the ones that put that gap in there god did for us then he's going to pick right back up and what do you do if they rejected his three and a half year message over here everybody with me they rejected this three and a half year message the jews did and he's not going to let him perish he's going to he's going to save him because he said he was he's going to have to preach that same message right here right anybody got that and then what really happens is this three and a half year message we accepted and that's what we've been living on for 2 000 years is a three and a half year message of jesus christ amen but they're only going to have 1260 days so he's going to have to send two prophets what does the book of amos say he does nothing until what he reveals it to the prophets okay so we come over here and we see that that message of jesus christ comes and lands in two prophets they preach three and a half years they preach it so much to where they see the cross and they see that lord of mercy we've done we've done something really awful and god's going to destroy us he said no he said i know you i know you you didn't see the nails in my hand here but through those two messengers like i read it before where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friends he said don't worry he said i'm going to take you up in the rapture then because the bible says right here and he shall confirm the covenant this is daniel 9 27. don't go back to it we've read this enough and he's he who's to he now listen god doesn't make a covenant and break it ever when god makes a covenant it's an everlasting eternal covenant everybody got that so this he is fixing to break the covenant so who is this he this he is the antichrist the beast that's right the pope because let me ask you a question i've got to cover this we'll stand outside and talk for two hours so we can talk in here if it's all right with y'all all right so the gentile bride does what she goes home and then the pope comes on the scene but what has israel been looking for for this whole two thousand years in ad70 titus a roman general destroyed jerusalem to the ground remember in matthew 24 they asked him three things he said they won't be a stone left on another well that was when titus a roman general get that roman general comes into jerusalem they shut the door and run into the temple course god's not there anymore and they literally eat their own kids and to bark off the trees titus finally goes in and destroys and kills everybody that's in there and the blood ran out the gate right but what did he take with him he took something very important that's going to be connected to the end time in 1870 titus destroyed the temple took it apart and took the menorah took the ark of the covenant took the laver took all the purple curtains took everything and where'd he take them to he's a roman general he didn't take him to italy common he took it to rome so who has a you know the temple mount people are trying their best and remember richard we're talking they've already got the according to the uh i can't remember the name of the of the article they've already got the red heifer the red heifer has been genetically modified in the united states because the red heifer could only have like three colors away from the red heifer they've got the red heifer ready but what do they need they need the menorah they need the laver and they need the ark right because see that's what they're trying to do they're trying to get all that back together because god told them in the old testament if you'll get all that together i'll meet you in that holy of holies so the temple mount people are trying their best for 2000 years they've been trying to put the piece of the puzzle together they don't have all the pieces but they know who's got them so when this pope comes up and we leave this place this pope comes up you know what the pope and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week what can what covenant is he going to give them i'm going to give you your things back but you got to do this for me you got to release all your gold you got to release all everything in the in the land of of israel to me i'm going to give you your things because remember and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease now what's the sacrifice and oblation he's they've given him they've given his ark back they've given israel their art back they're already making sacrifices they're trying to get the messiah here but what's going to happen during that three and a half years there stands two prophets outside of this new temple they've built going to make the people so mad that they kill 144 000 of their own people and two prophets that's right because for three and a half years they're going to be putting this temple back together and they're going to be doing their cutting and they're going to be doing their sacrifices and these two witnesses going to be standing outside the temple just like jesus did and said god's not in there you've already killed the lamb of god you can sacrifice all you want to and then 144 000 of their brethren are going to come out and they're going to say it's useless for you to put this temple together because i am the temple of god now but now who's also on the scene the pope's there and he says now wait a minute i'm the temple of god remember the bible says he wanted to be the temple of god sitting sitting in the temple of god showing himself to be what as god that's what's going to make everybody so mad right here and when it does the 144 000 and the two witnesses are going to be caught up and then you're going to see tribulation like you've never seen before that battle of armageddon is going to be so bad until it's going to be no holes barred so what's going to happen in the midst of the week cause of sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the over spreading of abomination he shall make it desolate you know what's going to happen the pope's going to walk into their temple and he's going to say i'm god and they ain't gonna like that because he desecrates the temple that's what he says he says the over spreading he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease in other words he's telling them to quit i'm him now and them jews ain't gonna like that even the ones that turn 144 thousand down are not going to like that and he shall make it desolate even until the consummation of that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate what's going to happen in the midst of that 70th week you say brother wait what happens over here well you got to remember a battle of armageddon a worldwide atomic battle doesn't last just one day it will be over a period of weeks or months before everybody's killed and then there's no telling how many people is going to be killed because of radiation and all the different things so you can carry that on but there's something got to happen from here to here there's going to be a millennial temple and we'll cover it later on there's going to be a temple built somewhere in here because that thing's got to be done at the end of that 70th week because the prophet of god tells us we're the anointing to the temple we're the anointing to the temple so they're going to build the temple because we don't know anything about temples because we're gentiles but they're going to build it and we're going to enter into that to anoint that temple for the thousand years of millennial reign and i'll read you some more quotes later on but the prophet of god tells us many many times he said they're going to absolutely hate these jews the 144 000 and then when they're caught up listen when they're caught up there is zero holy ghost on the earth zero i'm talking about all over the world listen the bride's gone 144 000 and the two witnesses they get the baptism of the holy ghost they're caught up in a rapture they're gone who's left satan the pope false prophet beast whatever you want to call them they're just going to start destroying each other and man has always destroyed their self and they're going to keep pushing buttons and pushing buttons and pushing buttons until this world's gonna be annihilated when we come back into the millennium i don't i don't i don't see why there's not they won't be structured still here because it's not gonna be completely wiped off like it is the battle of gog and magog they may be this you know the shell of this church may still be here but it's not going to bother us we got the biggest bomb there ever was called the baptism of the holy ghost and it's not going to harm us nuclear battle is not going to harm us if we come right back into the thing it's while it's going right but you know what we're going to be carried away we're going to be off in a safe place not going to have to worry about that what about folks you're standing and your flesh melts off your body before you die the birds will eat you before you die that's worldwide but not for the bride why would god send why would god send you through that but he is going to send the church to it because the church turned him down amen the church didn't get the holy ghost the ten virgins five of them were wives they went in the rapture the five foolish ones they did not because they were foolish let's not be foolish let's know that we know that we know that the new birth is in our soul not just something we think about something we talk about something we wonder about and something we hope for see i'm not going to hope that i go to all that i've got to go to the white throne judgment and hope that i'm going to get saved no no i don't think so folks you got to know that you know and you got to know now you will not get the holy ghost after the rapture takes place if you're a gentile gentile church door is closed listen when god closed the door and noah's age remember noah didn't close it god closed the door and he decided when to close it when he closed it there was not one person ever got on that ark again not one i'm sure i've told you many times before i'll bet you there were claw marks on the outside of that door people tried to get in i bet you there was claw marks on that outside of that ark with people trying to get up into that ark and the door was shut not another gentile was saved i'm talking about us now so let's stand to our feet we'll just go ahead and go right on in the communion if that's all right listen if you have a need today if you have a need today it's already been met and we have absolutely we have absolutely come to a place to where you can be healed standing in your seat and you can be healed we've seen people heal by taking communion because it's what it's an ordinance of god ordained of god an ordinance of god and and really it's a requirement of of all born-again believers because if you don't want to take communion then why wouldn't you want to because you're partaking of participating in something god told you to participate in same way with foot washing so let's go into the communion so if you have a need today let it be met while the communion is going on let it be met while the foot washing is going on okay so let's read in first corinthians 11 verse 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you drink this bread eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself in other words we're going to give a minute a moment of silence for you to clear the slate get everything out of the way and then you can take communion because it says for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body who's the lord's body me and you for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep that's pretty serious for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world now see that sets us apart right there that sets the bride apart we're not condemned with the world if we come under the conditions of the new birth we cannot be condemned with the world that's what it says right here wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger they meet at home that you come not together into condemnation the rest will not set an order when i come i've been reading the history of paul and when paul came up to the corinthians what happened was is the only rooms that the christians could use were usually people that were of wealth that had that were wealthy and had these big homes and big houses and they were just having parties they'd bring a big feast and they'd bring all the wine and they'd just eat and they would carry on and paul had to rebuke him and say no you you need to eat at home this is a lord's supper this is a solemn time this is the time when we pray and we don't go to all that carrying on business because he said if any man hunger lady meet at home that you come not together under condemnation he was watching them do that and he had to set him in order to make sure that they took communion and it was a solemn time and it was a time of of of reflection in the time that we what enter in with the sufferings of christ he said then the rest i will set an order when i come when you head back to the corinthians so let's um let's pray real quick and then we'll then we'll break the bread the heavenly father we pray lord that today now we move into another part of the service or this is a solemn time not to be playing because you said lord if we discern it wrong that many are weak and sickly among us and many sleep father we don't want that to happen we want us to be strong christians lord so lord i pray anything that we've done lord i pray that you bring it to all any of our remembrance lord and we promise we'll take care of it father just give us this daily bread as we partake it forgive us of our sins and bless the ones that are with us lord today in this house as we think about 2 000 years ago that people would have to meet lord in little places maybe catacombs and all the different places for fear of the of the persecution lord i pray that lord we live in a free country but lord we see that the rains are being tightened ever so much each day and lord until you come we're going to take this communion as much as we can as possible as we can and then lord we'll stay with you in the marriage supper and we'll take communion and we'll enjoy that time with you lord thank you for saving us lord thank you for filling us with the holy ghost and then thank you for bringing this message of the hour to our attention and where we can receive it lord we thank you for that father we ask you just bless the people in this building in jesus name we pray in the furtheman of this service amen the bible said he took bread and blessed it
