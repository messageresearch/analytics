given unto each one of us we ask you father that just help us and we realize that the human mind is Twisted in many ways about a lot of things and our thoughts and our ideas and Lord pull us apart but yet we know and for shity that you are God and you're in control and that you'll take care of everything that's right and I just ask you to help me to to say what you'd have to me to say Lord and let your grace be sufficient we love you and we thank you be with Brother Gary there Lord take care of him we believe he's going to be all right we just pray that you would deliver him from that fluid the things about his heart and the things Lord and and just touch him we commit it all to you in Jesus name amen amen Revelations 1 that we've been reading about for quite a while now one of these days we'll get around where we can preach on it and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one lik un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle remember the symbolics and the things showing of who he is his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like un Define Bryce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice is the sound of many Waters let's go over to Luke I've chosen Luke to read there's three times this Parable is um written out in the Matthew Mark and Luke I don't it's not in John it's mentioned as to things but not as laid out so let's go to Luke 8 and we'll start reading at verse 4 and when much people were gathered together and and were come to him out of the city he spake by a parable so went to sew his out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was shoten down and the fouls of the a devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was spraying up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it and others fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath an ear let him hear now remember this in this gospel that without a parable spake he not that he might hide it we were always taught you know that God made it simple no he spoke in Parables to hide it that's what the Bible says all right now listen in his verse n his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God now I don't want to keep you standing but I want to point your mind the kingdom of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right everybody with me the kingdom of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the way into the kingdom is being described amen all right the new birth all right and that's what he was describing now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside are they they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts see being sold lest they should believe and be saved and they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe on in a time of Temptation Fall Away wait and that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and a good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience all right now remember that keep it so go to Mark now as we'll just read that one scripture that we said was there that I wondered if he'd knew it was there verse 13 Mark 4 and13 and he said unto them in the explaining of the parable know ye not this Parable the parable what the parable of the so that's what's right above there all right and look what he says know ye not this Parable and how then will you know all Parables you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing so to me the key is the understanding of the parable of the soar of the seed because that's into the kingdom because if you don't get into the kingdom you you you won't have no understanding it it won't be there but I want you to keep that in mind when you come back to it and hear it and remember now in the parable as it's being said I said now that is the speaking of the kingdom of God the new birth salvation into the kingdom into the new birth all right are you with me now it's not just a simple little parable of uh just you know well he he tried to make a parable where they can understand now it says there that he spake in Parables you you know that it might be hidden right all right now I'm going to say it this way I believe brother Brandon spoke a lot of Parables absolutely right all right and in speaking those Parables I believe that's what hid it you know am the same way the Lord Jesus spake in Parables to hide it not to make it plain cuz some of the things brother brandham says and and you bring out and the new birth is one of them when we get down to it to really see in what he's saying you'll find out it it's really a parable I I believe Daniel 70 weeks is a drastic Parable that was spoken but it you know because it says in the 70 weeks book that it's you know the message he brother R said this is a parable all right and he's sping Parables to hide it amen from the eyes of the wise and prudent I believe the entire message was spoken Parables all right but see we think we understand the parable oh well we know the Parables we've read those things and we we've heard this but did you notice in hearing it that when it used is used in Matthew 13 that it says that they took and understood it right right right it says in mark 13 Mark about four there it says that when it in other words when they heard it they receive it right all right it says in Luke that we just read that they take it and keep it right what was it what is the parable of the so he started off telling you the parable of the so the store is the word right read all four in all three of your Parables about the and it's the word the seed right the word right that is planted all right now when we get back to that you follow that real close and it'll help you in what we're doing but now do not spend a lot of time on it every one of the writings uses uh Luke 814 it talks about the believe and is saved and talks about the heart in Matthew 13 it says that he that understandeth it not in his heart all right it says in Mark 4:5 that Satan cometh and immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in the heart all right now as we said this morning then talking of the new birth it the word heart is the center of man which is really what you are all right so then we could easily say you know that see Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word out of your soul not out of your thumping gizard called a heart that you can take a transplant and Aaron told me somebody lived 300 and something days with a mechanical heart well that's not exactly the uh you know the heart is the center of anything and that's what you are the soul the being the person you are all right but all of the parables are leading to one thing which is the birth of the word or the seed that was sown all right see then it has to be sown that's why I'm not going to argue with people about it but I do tell you what I believe and why I believe it that way so much is laid in the message of I come with this seed in me well where's it at and what is it then others say I come into the world with eternal life I got a quote I've got one too but you don't like mine Judas went hung himself and you go do likewise that's a direct quote how many times you want to hear the prophet say that but you that's not but brother Dale no no just the point see you say I've got a quote we were talking about it last night in the Bible study that it have been brought to my attention that brother randam said right before the Rapture it would return to a Garden of Eden condition you remember that now do you think the world is going to turn into a Garden of Eden if you do I'd like to sell you some stock in alcatra we're going to make it a tourist attraction would you already have it you understand what I mean there'll never be until the millennial Reign an Earthly situation of being like the Garden of Eden so now you go back to the Garden of Eden and what do you find that can be here now all right what we talking about W was bringing up the new birth puts your soul back like the Garden of Eden with eternal life well that's a Garden of Eden existence right while you're in the worst world conditions that could ever be thought of so this because you got a quote don't lay everything on a quote well bless God there's going to be a Gard if it ain't a Garden of Eden condition happens around here for the Rapture I just ain't going to believe it was was the word go out ahead go out ahead you remember one time when brother BR said it like this on a message he said I believe one day the black and white will fight again die like flies the next message he said that was my opinion not thus sayth the Lord see then we can say well I've got this I've got that all right but does it line up with the rest of the message that's right can you bring it all together to where you don't have to leave out something right yep or deny something or say that can't be true I just explained it to you there's a Garden of Eden conditioned by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into your soul in your soul is the Garden of Eden condition not in the rest of the things not in your body and your spirit cuz you got a battle but now what have we been dealing with I I don't want to get to start I want to try to finish this part and you know we're not through with this part of it we're just uh trying to bring it to a conclusion to where you can understand what I've been driving at then you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul the new birth doesn't take place in your body doesn't take place in your spirit goes you can your body is useless death doomed and everything else the spirit can be Anointed with and can be the genuine Holy Spirit and you still be lost so we better get to the condition of understanding and I want to bring this out later as we get into it but I want to lay down some little things and read something and then we'll we'll get to that point all right think about these things what is the new birth then brother brandham what is the New Birth the one that we claim to believe the prophet then we should be able to take what he says contrary to all of our former teachings right and uh Believe it or else if you can't believe what he taught on the new birth then you can't believe what he taught somewhere else that was a reason for me emphasizing that do it that Jesus said if you don't understand this parable of the sore of the seed then how then can you understand any of The Parables right now what was his first Doctrine you must be born again that's right all right so then the the parable would be being born in into the kingdom of God the seed is the word of God Amen but yet if you're going to still hold all of those things you know of saying then then you're annihilating the scriptures from helping you in any form as I was saying a second ago when you you say I come into the world with this seed in me well where's it at brother brandom said that the seed was put in you before the foundation of the world now that's a direct quote right amen but where is it at and what is it Jesus said the seed is the word of God well he didn't seem to be putting it to where that you was born with something I believe his emphasis say was that the kingdom is lik UN to a seed that was sown and the word sown into our heart and I asked a simple question to people that were talking about the seeds and the things and I believe what the prophet said about it always have been and always been able to accept it that way but I asked a person I said are you born again by the SE did you come into this world with in you as you think or was it the words you heard after you got here that's right that's all I want to know because see if you say it was a seed you were born with you don't need no preacher you don't need no Prophet you don't need nobody to explain it right all you need is the spirit of God to descend and if everybody in the day of the time of the Holy Ghost coming of 120 from The Upper Room at one time and then 3,000 outside they were surely more right around that period of time of days and weeks or months or whatever from the day of Pentecost there were surely a lot of other people saved right you agree right well how come I didn't get it on there Pentecost oh brother Dale you're so deep you're so this you're so is that deep that's simple speaking of asking you a simple question if you know what you're talking about you can answer the question right but I put that out across the land from the internet anyone to show me the truth about that not as sarcastics or aggravating I want to know the truth you know what I've got probably between 80 to 100 people sitting in this church that are depending in one way or the other at least a little bit upon what I'm saying it may be just a little bit but it's all right and I I want to tell you the truth and you know what my soul is involved you know what what I want to know the truth I'm sincere about it but I'm just showing you or trying to to get you to think the way into the kingdom is made plain and simple by the Lord Jesus in The Parables first you hear it comes into your heart you believe it some people believe it more than others because they hold on longer than others some take it and go all the way through and receive the new birth right all right then what is the new birth what is the natural birth wasn't that what we were talking about the other day of of the Nicodemus you know what is the natural birth it takes a planting of the seed it takes the life to the seed it takes the years and you know I mean a months in the times of nine months to bring forth a natural birth of the one little seed germ that you started with well I thought that that was what you know the Lord Jesus was talking to Nicodemus about was explaining the natural birth for you be able to understand the spiritual birth all right you understand the natural birth the birth of the seed that is planted right right that's the baby right that's where the baby come from from the seed that was placed into the wound and germinated right and it come forth a baby now there's your natural birth all right what would be your spiritual birth right there's never nobody in the Bible ever got the new birth without first hearing the word that's now come on show me in the Bible let's quit playing right show me in the Bible somebody that got saved without hearing the word first come on you know it's not even that ain't even sensible well brother D I just got it I just I never heard nobody I just sitting out under a tree and it dropped okay if you got but don't tell me you never heard it from nobody that's right if you read the Bible you heard it from somebody right do you understand then amen so what is the new birth we'll read in a minute what your Prophet says the new birth is all right then we'll continue on into the process but I want you to read this so go ahead with number one and let's see what the prophet has to bring out about this new birth is taken from the message of a paradox which is preached in ' 63 paragraph 98 the Virgin birth was a mystery to the people they couldn't understand it just like the new birth is today the new birth is a mystery to the people right they can't understand it they don't know what you mean they have belittle it bring it down saying you know saying they make it little bring it down by saying well just because you believe something there's people that believe that right just because you believe it that you're born again what dides he say the Devils believe the same and tremble right is that scripture right watch it isn't what you believe it's what God has actually done all right the new birth is a birth it was a new it was a paradox when God brought new life to the human race to reject it is eternal separation to receive it is eternal life all right this new birth started by the birth of a baby we call Jesus because that was where it was transmitted down to you and I to bringing us to that position all right going to Christ is a mystery go to number two Christ is the mystery of God reveal paragraph 240 the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth see now you can blow that into your mind of your thinking he's talking about Christ as a mystery of the three-fold Revelation that's fine because if you don't get fold number one of a three-fold revelation you ain't going to get the other too amen right so then solve the problem but see God has revealed to you this great mystery now he just said up here that the new birth is a mystery what do you mean it's a mystery all you need to do just get B again okay tell me how well you just believe well the devil believe well you shout well a lot of people the prophet said shouted and didn't get it right you speak in tongues a lot of people spoke in tongues and didn't get it right so what is the new birth so we see it's a mystery and like I said about Nicodemus we say about Nicodemus well that poor old ignorant Nicodemus all he had to do was believe and he didn't know what the new birth is it's just believing what is the new birth okay he said here it's a mystery then he says it's a revelation right y so it must be the mystery revealed is the new birth you following me the mystery revealed to you is your new birth amen amen now what else are you going to make it well I shouted no that's the attributes that's the baby after it gets here that's not the birth of the baby remember the birth of the baby is an example a parable are type of the birth of the new birth that's why that it's got to be water blood and spirit that's why it's got to be seed planted word Made Alive and then the birth of the baby right all right so you got to hear the word it's got to be quickened it's got things that it does through that process of justification and sanctification and then the life or eternal life all right so it's a revelation look at the next one this is taken from the patmas vision preached in 1960 12:04 prph 71 now ask God while we're talking on Revelation ask him to give you a revelation of this now watch it for it can only be known by Revelation and you can only be saved by Revelation well I I just I just felt it no if I'm P for today forgive me okay because I'm going to get this off my heart what happened in the upper room you know there was a whole lot of things transpiring in the upper room where it was filled with the spirit of God and the floating around that doing but didn't it come down to one final analysis and it said tongues of fire set on each one of them paraphrasing brother brandham what did he say that was that's the new birth when that Pillar of Fire that lick of fire that was on each one of them came into the soul of each individual it wasn't the shouting it wasn't the doings it wasn't the speaking in tongues that was outside later right right are we right he said and they spake with tongue here you sitting upstair downstairs maybe might have been 30 minutes later or whatever it was they were outside speaking in tongues but you got to put it back to where he said when that lick of fire was sitting on each one of them all right you can only be saved by Revelation you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you amen now no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is the Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost right amen come on he might say the pastor says so the Bible says so them are truths the church says so that is true but you don't know know yourself until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you and he's become in you no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost not by knowledge not by intellectual all right first it's a mystery second it's got to be revealed thirdly you can only be saved by Revelation well brother D I just went up to the altar shook the preacher's hand and said want to be saved or I cried I done this are are you trying to tell me I ain't born again why would you say that why would you say right that that you're thinking like that it could be a signing something wrong with you it could be a sign you need to be saved I didn't get no Revelation when I got the new birth well according to the prophet you didn't get it right y bless God you ain't going to tell me that way I'll just get up and late goodbye not joking dead serious more than any time in my life cuz I'm facing something I've got to express to you I'm not joking he said well if you had said so and so think a lot of people would still be here did I run anybody off by the word of God let me ask you a simple question why didn't you go that's right amen yes sir that's all I got to say why didn't you go okay but you see I try to do everything I can and to bring it down the way that I can bring it for you to understand because I'm not trying to be popular I'm not trying this church wouldn't build on popularity it's built on one thing what does the word say all right now look see first it's a mystery then it's a revelation to explain the mystery only to you because you're the one getting the birth all right then you're saved by Revelation from God's word now look what he says go ahead with number four when you must be born again 1961 12:31 in the morning now false teachers will bring false birth now do you understand what he means by that do you realize if you have been taught that you're speaking in tongues as your new birth that's a false teacher that taught you that the word of God didn't teach you that if you're taught that you cried you got the new birth that's a false teacher if it's just believe the prophet's message that's a false teacher that's right but watch what he says true prophets will bring the word all right brother brandom brought the word right but anybody true whether it be male female whoever that tries to bring you to Christ fits in that category right amen if they really got the word or seed all right watch what he said true prophets will bring the word the birth of the word Christ right false prophets will bring false birth birth the birth of churches the birth of Creeds the birth of denominations and here you are Pentecostal Brothers false sin or Sensations and tell a man he's got the Holy Ghost because he speaks with tongues I've seen Devils speak with tongues pencils lay on lay down and write in unknown tongues that don't mean a thing see it's got to be a life y by their fruits you shall know them brother brandom do you believe in speaking in tongues yes sir you believe in shouting shouting yes sir to be a Christian I believe that I believe God's word but if the life isn't there to back it up now where's it at number five spoken word Original Seed 1962 3:18 paragraph 151 now for the birth of the word is Christ not have polluted with denominations the early church no denomination just a word and spirit irrigated brother and the god laid the word down like that and the Holy Spirit irrigated it and there she went she brought forth children certainly so now what is it right the birth of the word y all right back to Christ the Myster of God revealed picking up on paragraph 233 and read just quite a bit all right so go ahead that would be number six look Christ in you makes you makes him the center of the life of the Revelation see Christ life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do what is the new birth then you'd say well brother brandom what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you right then you shout then you cry then you speak in tongues but Revelation first right amen not you joined the church you shook a hand you done something different you set a Creed you promised to live by or C of Ru but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest or whatever it might be is Christ in you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon roll it on up you got some little things in between you read it what is it is Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself see that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws and fulfill his word by death and Christ God do in flesh in order to them sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeem back that will be leave only in the word of God and not swap it like Eve did for intellectual conceptions of man you see it that's Christ's idea that's God's idea the new birth reveals this okay now may I put a point in he just said that God had to die in flesh right to bring us this new birth amen do you believe that God had to die in flesh to bring us his new birth well then how come there so much in the message that everybody says you always was eternal that you already had it when you got here what do you need Jesus for what do you need a new bird for right you mean e in flesh to make it known to you that you always was I know what brother BR was talking about come on we've been over and over you read it when he says you always was eternal look back in what he said he said if you have eternal life today the eternal life was always Eternal there's not but one seed that's right and that's the word of God Amen look and if a man says he's born again and try to place these promises of God in this last day days to some other day making him Christ yesterday but not today then that man or that person has been in a delusion by Satan if that man says that he believes that and it doesn't manifest itself through him okay that's far enough all right what is the new birth it's the birth of the seed as the natural birth was a birth of the seed that was planted into the wound of the mother and must be given life and then the child comes forth the spiritual birth is the birth is the word that is sown and that's The Parables the word is sown the Holy Ghost comes to irrigate the word and the child comes forth the natural is the top of the spiritual right okay so what is the New Birth the birth of the word the birth of the word right so then that means the word has to be planted that's right I mean I just got to planting a garden we did the other day you know Nanny and Terence and I doing Zach heing on some of the others we planted a garden well you know wouldn't it be something to walk out there and look and and we know exactly what we planted in what rows we planted it but even if you some beh have something happened that we have three rows of okra and that three rows of ochre comes up to be turnip greens wait just a minute that wouldn't want our sold right remember you get what you plant and remember the birth is a birth of what you plant right any seed your Prophet says has to what rot planted beans about probably four weeks ago I guess got maybe a half a dozen stocks well you know what something happened they didn't rot and come forth and produce more beans I left them because I hope they will but I went right by the side of them and planted more beans cuz I wouldn't go take no change cuz I just you say well you you will you a farmer yeah yeah and I realized that before that seed can do anything the outside has to rot before you can be born again you got to rotten away die to yourself before the life can come so if I come into the world with eternal life why do I need God for they don't read where brother brandham said it's a seat of representation from predestination and another one says a representation by predestination well you just took away everything that that that I I I believe that I list when I first heard it brother so and so explained that and I just seen that I always was eternal how'd you get it now where does God have anything to do with it will he give it to me well when did he give it to me well it was put in me when I come into the world the quotes are there it's all right you got quote but what about going back a little bit further where he said the seed was put in for the foundation of the world how about that quote and remember it's the birth of the word so the word has to be planted that's right how can we hear without a what and how can he do what unless he's what right amen I ain't no preacher have anything to do with my salvation did you read the Bible well yeah well that was some preachers a whole Bible full of them somebody had to bring the word to you why did brother brandham say if he's not tying together a lot of things he said the seed comes through the body right right he said that's why that who was it Philip had to go down to the Ethiopian unic and remember there was some people in the Bible that were some of the Apostles that were trying to get the Holy Ghost to fall on some people and it wouldn't do it you remember that that's in the book of Acts and they sent for Peter and John or something what was it and they came down and they just said a few words and the Holy Ghost fell amen but brother Dale I just don't feel good when you preach brother so and so preaching I just feel so good I want to get up run with him I'm not making no liot I'm telling the truth true I thought that we believe that if a dumb donkey was able to correct a prophet that we were supposed to believe the word it didn't matter who it come from but I just don't feel it what do you need you need chill bumps we'll run downstairs and get some ice water pour it on you not a joke I'm dead serious wouldn't you do it if you believe that would be what would bring the Holy Ghost on it right would you not go get the ice and pour water down somebody's back come on sisters brothers whoever wouldn't you do that if you believed that that would bring the Holy Ghost righten but you know what they done in the days of the Methodist may I quote your Prophet they poured water on them that were in the floor shouting to keep the holy ghost from coming on them that's right do you need that quote the Holy Ghost was there and then pouring water on them drove it away I'm sorry but I thought we wanted the truth am what is the New Birth the birth of the word to the disciples it says they took it they understood it said they received it they said they kept it or keep it there a correct word there what was the difference in the disciple what was the difference in those that were uh the Bible said that Jesus was seen of over 500 Brethren well what happened to 380 of them because there were only 120 in the upper room well they just didn't get the message they didn't get the memo yeah what about it folks what is the new birth why is it so important for you to hear this message would you like for me to turn over and read the LI one I have on you where brother brandham says your Pentecostals turn down the birth of the word and you know what he related that to he said as Mary denied the Virgin birth of the Lord Jesus when she said your father and I have sought you diligently brother BR said she turned down the birth of the word and you know who Mary represents ausa Street Pent C right is that Masterpiece or seed not hour with the sh cuz that quote is from the seed not hour with the sh that they turn down the birth of the word I never been there and do those things I've seen it but I've seen it in Jamaica when uh people were taking the little kids and grabbing their chin and pulling it up and saying say it say it say it say it say it say it say it sorry folks but just for a moment now I want to ask you a serious question I want you to listen with me and if I say ha High I see you getting sleeping everybody stand up okay because I I want this on tape in the way that I've tried for 40 something years to explain it and to put it into simple terminology cuz I've waited for that all right what is a soul it's you the prophet said you're a soul you're a being your person when that baby comes from the mother and dropped a little boy girl drops forth they start immediately forming their nature of what they are their little soul doesn't know a whole lot you don't recogniz there certain things around them but there's a soul within that baby or else is dead all right even Jesus when he was a little fell in the Cradle could not die for your sins even at 12 or 13 years of age that he could confound the wives he could still not die because the soul of that person had not fully developed into what it would be when he would reach the age of accountability know coming up then he would come on and then he would gain ground and he would keep going and he would be 30 years of age correctly to say 29 and a half because the Bible doesn't say 30 it says becoming 30 that's the only way you can explain that Jesus was born in April and crucified in April now do you believe that that's what your Prophet said he was born in April crucified in April now how could he preach three and A2 years so he was becoming 30 the Bible says for the priest to enter the Ministry Jesus at 29 and a half began his ministry and as he did his first message was you must be born again am it took all those years to bring that person to that place that that soul that being that he was was then ready to do whatever was necessary and bring a message when a baby is born naturally it starts programming being programmed it looks up it sees lights it looks around it hears the nurse is cussing and saying Full Moon and blanky blank all these babies being born the poor little thing enters the world in a bad shape it goes like we were saying this morning when it comes to the age of accountability God doesn't record a lot about it you know but when it reaches that age of accountability then God puts on a record the prophet said and it begins to record our lives that's right all right so you're not repenting for just being a baby when you repent you that's that's not the point all babies go to heaven right right do we need that quote because of the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter what Mom and Daddy is or who is what all babies under the age of accountability go to heaven wonderful God we serve all right now so the molding of that baby's nature we'll call it we'll call it that for the purpose of following the lineup throughout the message of understanding and the spirit is the nature of the Soul or displays what the soul is the soul has a nature it's either of God or it's of the world so automatically when it's first born it's of the world all right that's why it needs to be born again all right that nature for years it took that to build that and the environment you are around is what causes you to be the way you are I've even preached to you that I don't believe in homosexualities are are lesbian form of being some genetic form of some germ you happen to be born with that others were not I believe it's hereditary well Mom and Daddy wouldn't in that and no but there was little things you see certain people you know and you'll say well you know they kind of act a little odd because they were raised by mama and Grandmama right hi higher raised by Grandma and Grandpa was not involved so they act a little bit on I'm glad you said that they don't like like for me to use that word feminist right that's right that's why the boy needs the masculine leadership see because it forms a little different in him by his father building a nature bringing a person to a place that they become a real person and see then one day that person that has been molded which is the soul inside of you and that's why I believe like I do what the prophet says page 80 of the Hebrew Book that your soul is your theop now I know you're looking at that and I still ain't got to her to preach on it but you're thinking my theop is way up your I hear my theophany calling me that's a pretty song but it scripture but it's a pretty song see everybody thinks that theop is way up yonder brother R says your soul is your theophany that's right and he says the nature of your soul is going downward if you're not born again said when it you turn it turns upward so then a sinner has a theophany which is a body right The Sinner right today if he dies where does he go it's easy for us to think where the Christian goes right come on you what did it even the angel of the Lord referred to when brother Brandon was beyond the curtain of time the angel of the Lord referred to souls under the altar but I've always been taught that I've got this and my theop is way out under where did they get it from brother Brandon right show it in the message right show it in the Bible no it's what you've been listening to you've been listening to somebody explain something that they had no Revelation see because your soul is the real you the real you is your theophany remember there is a theophany of The Sinner a body that they step over into out of the human flesh or they don't step over into it that's really incorrect it's not that they step over into it it's just that Soul leaves that body what about an amazing thing that your Prophet could go there and be young like they were and look back and see his body wiggling on the bed right see then the important thing is the revelation right you say yeah but the Bible says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting look at all the questions if it be dissolved right brother random who is this MCH we don't have the bodies yet that's right but you don't want that quote but you see that little baby that Soul begins to be molded into the person that it is and even if they're identical twins they's still two different Natures there even the the magazine thing for sister Trudy that showed that where that there was two parts of two body parts up here two heads two THS and grow it into one one body down here with flesh and one of them girls like there was two girls and one of them like boys and the other one didn't two different Natures even though they were so conjoined is that they were hooked together with only like the bottom parts that's being one see takes quite a while to build that nature into what we are amen and it takes quite a while for God to get that nature to agree with him that we read this morning on who is it on um what is it I'll get it in a minute souls in prison brother R said if he can get that nature to agree with him he said it'll die now where's the wrong and what a problem see then if you can see that your soul is the real you that's what you are and it took a long time to bring you to where you are and what you've been taught all of your life is what motivates you or has brought you to the place that you believe what you believe right all right some way somehow God enters into that person not in body cuz that won't save you not in spirit cuz that doesn't save you God in some miraculous way can enter and speak to that inner being the real person that you are and if you'll just do like the disciples cuz remember it says many took it and believed it but the cares of life and the things went on and they lost it but some believed it you had never read where the Dr disciples would say now we believe you that you are this that and Jesus even would say do you now believe right y you know as it come to the place that you believe they were living the parable that he was talking about the word was being swn into their heart their being their soul the word was being planted into them but to some it just got to the brain out they went some it got a little further and got into the spiritual Realm you know the spirit part and to begin to act like they were Christians Judas is a good example right because you want to use him as a dirty gu all the time anyway and uh well it took three and a half years are you listening it took three and 1/2 years to drive that unclean Spirit out of them disciples it took three and A2 years to plant the word that they would finally say where can we go thou Hast the words of eternal life yet turn right back around and say we don't understand what's going on are you going to restore the kingdom now because they didn't understand that in the book of Acts they got over acts one and along in there right they were still looking for a literal Kingdom after all they'd heard and seen but you know what they only had one thing to their advantage they stayed with the Lord Jesus to hear the word you ever notice brother brandom in what he says he said Paul never left his converts he he stayed with them until they got anchored what's he talking about he said that was Billy Graham's problem he said because they didn't have anything you know they didn't stay with them and keep them going he said Paul went and live with the man right now like we was explaining to somebody there yesterday suppose the man that Paul was talking to received this new birth we see Paul then could stay with that man and and teach him the stature of a perfect man up to right here you know what he come out to be faith of the fathers but what about somebody that never got the new birth exactly when he first expressed it what about some of them like at the house of of apoll what in know Words the book of Acts when they were having a great Revival talking about Jesus Christ but they didn't know he had come and died they knew about him and they were talking about it and Paul explained to him that he was dead now and he'd come to do what he said he's going to do and you know what they got the new birth but does that help you understand right three and a half years the disciples live with this man I come on don't be silly with me you said well the disciples only with him about 3 years two months and three days boy you're really smart You're just showing how dumb and idiot you are don't be playing words you can get yourself in trouble with God playing with words trying to show how smart you are forgive me but that's truth you think you straighten something out because it was not that wasn't my wife is real bad I'll say we went to town on Thursday it was Friday I said we got there Thursday at 2:00 it wasn't it was Friday at 3: she's really got to keep me right on what we're doing cuz she thinks I'm losing it upstairs and you know what I never did have anything to lose I probably lost that a long time ago but is it true I'm not throwing off on her I'm telling you just like we all are we love to correct each other okay get you to life before you get away from that sad part listen what happens in the New Birth then see the disciples we'll use those as examples to leave it but speaking of us the disciples had the opportunity for three and A2 years to not just hear what the man said but question him about what he was talking about and he would explain it to them privately of what he was saying and what was going on you know that this is the way into the kingdom I spoke in Parables to hide it from the others but now you can understand what I'm talking about I've come to die I must give my life I must set a stage and fix it to where you can have what I have but the only way it can be done is you're going to have to have it done in that soul that being that person that you are all right as I said and we say it again however old you are as how long you've been working on your nature in your ways that's your soul that I'm talking about no that's my body Spirit no no no no no no body without the spirit is dead Spirit can be Anointed with a Holy Ghost and still wrong we're not dealing with that you're not birthed there you're birthed in that stroll cuz that's the only place the word stays you take that word and you hold it you you say I don't understand it that's right I didn't understand this message when I walked out of the Baptist Church did you understand it when you left where you were at no it took years to understand they didn't run me out of the Baptist Church I left in my own accord because I knew I was contrary to their Doctrine and thereby I couldn't stay in that church that's what they asked me when I come out my mother asked my brother where you going I said I don't really know I said' I know what I'm doing now I'm going up to a church at Gainsville because i' been up there a couple of times but I said I don't really know my brother said are you a preacher I said don't know nothing about it don't make no claims to me he said well if you want a church we'll just build you a church well I had enough power in that church to probably sway the whole church and took it over cuz what I didn't have on my side my brother-in-law had it on his side all I had to do is get him a degree and he had aund and I had a 100 and there was a half a dozen left that couldn't fight it right but you understand something begin to dwell within those disciples heart now think of yourself what it says think of yourselves of your life and your coming and where you're at say when you first heard of this message and see for some reason you believed it yes maybe you wouldn't even born again maybe like me maybe you found out you wouldn't born again because of the message maybe you were born again but something started ringing a bell hey you know this is right that's the most simple I've ever heard that scripture explained and the Bible just become started becoming alive you remember it and the things that used to be mysterious Mysteries you begin to gradually understand you know the Bible does say being born again that's right by The Incorruptible word of God which is being is a process taking place over a long period of time right but you see we put it on well I believe I'm born again cuz I come to the message I wouldn't have come to the message if that been for that well the disciples walk with the message and put their life on the line with the messenger for three and a half years that they were people were fighting against their master and was putting wanting to put him to death and trying to kill him and and then you know what they wound up getting done the same way after they had received what he had then maybe sometimes it takes a long period of time for the new birth to process see we want to think oh I I come to the altar it doesn't make any to to you but when I saw what Brandon was talking about I said I do not have the new birth he was speaking of because first off I didn't have the word I was a trinitarian how many of you were that right how many of you believed in your father or Son and Holy Ghost I remember when sister Gail she got to the point she be to see the truth of about the the understanding of the godhead and you know she used to sing with the what Atlanta Christian choir course on up to the voice like an angel right but then she told me one day she said I just kind of Li through that part where it says Father Son and Holy Ghost Blessed Trinity you just kind of live through it are you changing or you you ever do that bless right there you go she put something else in the place what if they' put her on the microphone somebody probably run her out of the group she wouldn't have been singing with the group no more but okay see it takes a long time sometime few you come to the place that actually the spirit could Quicken it cuz I want to ask you some simple questions now give me a few more minutes can God Quicken the word that's not real see the Trinity can't be revealed cuz there's no such thing right I got a revelation of the Trinity who'd you get it from you had to get him the devil it certainly didn't come from God cuz it can't be revealed cuz it ain't true but that's what we thought right see it takes a maybe for that word that seed that you heard to dwell within your soul long enough for you to make a decision and to see that you're lost the prophet said that Jesus couldn't get them Pharisees to realize they were lost so he could die for them now what about us Pharisees and Sadducees but I when I heard it I believed it okay but don't talk to me about it okay I'm sorry I'm mean hateful and arrogant but I remember sometimes when it took months and years for to drive that Trinity out of you the you would tell anybody else later W as quick as I saw it I didn't believe that no more well why did I have all the problems we trying to get you to see the truth well brother Dale it just looks like this Tre there's got to be something I can't understand you know I'm sorry I I got too good of a memory right but you see those disciples for three and a half [Music] years heard the word the pure unadulterated word straight from the mouth of almighty God and they still was sitting in the upper room like a bunch of scared chickens afraid somebody was going to open the door any minute and expose them but when the Holy Ghost came they went right out of there to let the world see something had happened the word has been given birth now quote the prophet paraphrase just a her but it's close spoken word's Original Seed he said they was and he calls them seeds I checked that to make sure he said those seeds were pulled into the upper room which meant 120 individuals that had believed enough of the word to go there and wait when the other 380 that had seen Jesus after his resurrection did not make it to the upper room something went wrong the cares of Life the threatenings of the parable of the of the things throughout the the parable of the s the 500 of them Rejoice to see his resurrection but some what 10 days later or something they couldn't be found but you know what I love about the Bible I don't think it plays with words I believe those 380 come on to Salvation you want me to prove it to you in the Bible because the Bible called him Brethren to start with you didn't notice that he said he was seen of other F more than or something like that 500 Brethren I believe they come on to the truth eventually that's just personal that's all right that's not nothing you know no argumentative just a point but what is the new birth then brother Dale for 40 something years I've tried to explain something to you because I've always believed it that way since I've seen what had happened to me and what I believe the prophet was trying to explain in the Bible that you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul I've tried to teach that for 40 something years right and some of you would remember it cuz my wife brought it back to me last night I was listening to them talk I like to do that I like to get you into a good little discussion and I shut up and listen to see if you know what you're talking about brother collie where you remember that I said one of these days I'm going to get him into the biggest argument in the world with somebody and I'm going to back off in the corner and I S it over I'm going to find out what this boy believes you know but how many times have you ever heard me explain go ahead and pull up now the three rings here maybe I can get it in 10 minutes all right pull up the the the three rings brother I know who's there brother um brother Bob was back there all right the three rings of mankind the outer part the sea tast SP smell here the inner part memories and conscience and the Soul as the center which is Faith or doubt all right now what is the new birth the dis the disciples heard the word they saw it they could partake of it smell you know do the thing they could taste the Heavenly gifts they had the feelings and all they had come into an inner real from the outer Court into an inner realm until they had come with the affections the memory the reason the conscience and things of them in their spirit real that when they come to that they said well we know you've got the words of eternal life there ain't nowh else to go but remember this as far as it got right when the Bible says that he breathed on him and said receive you the Holy Ghost your Prophet explained that right what does that mean they did not get it right then it was a promise to come now I'm going to quote brother brandham brother Brenham says you believe unto eternal life and he said see th the discipl believed on him and had eternal life now this getting to a spot now you can't have eternal life until the death of Jesus Christ so evidently brother R saying something I believe you believe un eternal life that's right and I believe by predestination God knows you're going to have eternal life so as far as he was concerned the disciples already had it but that didn't mean they had it in their possession okay now the word out here the outer real the C tast field smelling here you got to hear it got to come in then it goes through your memories and and how it goes through there I don't understand because all of this is garbage can of the best we can do with the memory reason but some way the birth of the Soul so that word coming this far won't save you the word coming this far won't save you amen the word's got to come into your being and it took three and a half years to drive out that unclean spirit and you know that brother randam even said it to show you how technical the man was in his wording it hits me how great a man could be to say it he said those disciples were only potentially Justified he said they were only potentially San he said because Christ had not died yet that's right right but you see the word they heard drove the unclean Spirit out of the man brother Brown said John preached justification Jesus preached sanctification because Jesus preached the planning of the word the planning of the word into those disciples now the day of Pentecost could come the Holy Ghost could fall now here's where you're going to differ with me but you can go ahead and do what you want to because I'm just dumb enough to Keep On Believing what I believe I'm sorry that baptism of the Holy Ghost can anoint your flesh that baptism of the Holy Ghost can anoint your spirit right does the baptism of the Holy Ghost go in your soul soul don't answer too quick cuz you might get clicked a little okay just hold your point does the baptism of the Holy Ghost go in your soul or does it make alive the word that's in your soul now you're getting somewhere it makes alive the word that's in your soul it don't have to go in there it just irrigates quickens makes alive the word that you've held within you he said but I always thought it was the baptism well now you're confused out here because you don't know what the baptism fits in come on I'm not against that we'll get through the message I believe the Holy Ghost comes down and it doesn't matter where you got two people standing there and one of them winds up being an anointed one the other one winds up being a genuine Christian the anointed one he's got no word in his soul in the P Purity he's allowed the cares of Life the things to happen to take him over he's allowed his church that he's going to he's allow lot of things to keep him from coming to that inside man would say I don't know what I'm disciples I don't know what it is but I know one thing you got the word of eternal life and if there's any hope for me whatsoever let me believe that right when that Holy Ghost came down on the day of Pentecost it anointed their spirit because come on the Bible said in the last days you brought my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and your daughters that's Bible sir do you have to put the holy spirit inside that's okay if you want to say that I'm not going to argue with you I'm just going to say that word that you've took right in there is the real you that Peter as much as he was and even deny but yet he was the one that made the confession thou aren't the Christ the son of the Living God God had made that known to the man what was his birth on the day of Pentecost that that he had said Was Made Alive the Holy Spirit comes down through does it have to come and dwell here see there what we want to call it the baptism and now you're getting into confusion cuz the prophet says you can have the baptism right every day of your life and miss it why if that Holy Spirit comes right here Why didn't it birth that birth that person how come that person don't get the new birth then we want to call them anointed ones they've got Christianity in our they've got Christianity in the spirit they've got the anointing of the Holy Ghost they got the gifts they got the signs they got the Wonders they got the love of God they got their things but yet they're not forign again why is God a respector of persons cuz you see if I've got any ounce of the that old man left in me right you remember last Sunday I tried to express something to you where the Bible says it's holy ghost in fire that's the scripture brother R says all right now that you know paraphrasing him he said really when you saying it said it's the fire and Holy Ghost now he's not correcting the scriptures he's just explaining what's happening cuz you see when that Holy Spirit comes down to here that Holy Spirit yes comes in here into the point of burning out everything that's left of you that is not right why there's not a lot of New Birth because the people don't have the word planted in their hearts that's right how can God Quicken a trinity you're in your makeup your being and you're still as trinitarian as can be what's wrong is God a respect to a person that he would anoint this person here and that would be you here or anybody else here but yet he'll give you the new birth right it gives you the new birth but to the other person it's just anointing cuz you see the anointing does the same in both people the anointing anoints the spirit that's right yes sir the birth of the word is in the soul that word is Christ quotes from The Prophet yeah it's God and you together as persons now what does he mean you've got some problems is we're trying to say this morning the prophet says you grieve that Holy Spirit he said he goes out on the limb now are he lost when he goes out on the limb if all you can deal with is in here and he comes out of here here then you're leaving the person lost or unregenerated you see what I mean for 40 years I've tried to explain that because I saw what your Prophet was saying that anointing come down upon the spirit of mankind pour it out on All Flesh right but why didn't it give birth to all because they never had the word swn into their hearts and you say well brother Dale and for 40 years or more going into 50 now started in 1971 preaching first message was 1969 and you know it was so odd the message I preached in 1969 that the Bride of Jesus Christ was the son of man cuz that's what I understood you said brother Dale now the disciples we've seen them they took the word they held the word it drove that unclean Spirit out of them it planted the word into that Soul into that being of Peter to where that he was standing there but what was he he was a seed he was rened out enough but he needed a life and that lick of fire came down on the day of Pentecost and brother Brandon said went on each one of them he said and went into their soul and quickened the word that's right you mean I've got to understand every see I try to pick up the mind if you're thinking you mean I've got to understand everything Peter understood no no no no Martin Luther Martin Luther was a man he was all into the trouble it was but he fought the Catholic church he they had protested Catholic Church people had before Luther come along and Luther was right in that protest against her systems and when he was all at once something happened when he was reading Romans and he said do Jo shall live by faith did that make p that make Luther quit drinking did it make him stop smoking a poipe no because he didn't have the word to take that out of him but he had enough word that he said the just shall live by faith we don't have to do these penances we don't have to go to the pope we go straight to Jesus Christ amen for our Salvation yes sir amen and you know what that was the birth John Wesley believed and taught what Luther taught now you want some records of it I got some books at home if you'd like to read them John Wesley he never was the first one to come up with sanctification he got on the boat headed to America matter of fact he came to Georgia right and in his journey he was coming over here as a missionary under the just shall live by faith but yet he had seen everything had went so far away from Luther's real correct teaching of the just shall live by faith by Revelation that the man was sincerely seing for God what's wrong what's a matter you know what God used somebody every how you pronounce it moravians or moravians or something they were the original teachers of sanctification he was on that boat headed here they taught him the truth you know what he come back home he said I went to America to convert the Heathen he said come to find out I was a heathen myself and needed to be converted then it was as a prophet calls it the new birth of sanctification fell in into a man's heart there were a lot of protests and things right around the turn of the century against those things and theusa Street was not the original teachings of one God the zeusa street was trinitarians Daddy Seymour and those men they were still trinitarians but yet they felt that call in their lives that to see that the people had gotten away from the real truth and to begin to C C out and God answered that with gifts and signs and wonders but we just put it all they got was gifts now they got the person of Jesus Christ you want me to quote brother random he said the Holy Ghost came himself on the day of Pentecost it's about 464 seal book he said another great prophet he calls isusa Street a great prophet he said but then like others at the end of the age he said then the messenger came who was brother brandham ausa Street came forth with the birth of the word not just gifts the birth of the word each age has been the birth of the word may I quote the Bible have you received the gift of the Holy Ghost since you believe have you received the Holy Ghost after hearing of this message what do you mean I had it I wouldn't come in message well the devil's here did he get it now get away from stuff like that cuz that's that's junk in your mind well don't you think that God led me I said it I believe God led me into this [Music] message but then this message brought Christ to me and I seen that I didn't have that new birth that's right and I cried out to God to receive it and it took two years to get enough word planted to where the holy GH ghost could fall two years that I've read six books in one day and listen to two tapes brother col is witness to a lot of it all I done was read I set up there where he was at working me and him was talking about the Lord or just sitting down there all day long A lot of times reading I've told you about it and you just you look at me like I'm crazy or something the man I worked with on his end of the table he had Playboy magazines we had a table for our desk for working he had Playboy magazines he had filthy on the other end I had the Bible and the prophet's message well brother Dale is you brother see brother said I'm a human being we don't have to expl explain that there was just something inside that was controlling till even told you about the time that he told me and I was speaking on the pyramids here and he told me he said Playboy magazine has got an article on the pyramids of Egypt I said would you bring it and let me read it I was sitting in the office he was outside working we changed positions but we were up I was sitting there reading the Playboy magazine and a man come walking down the line and looked over oh he found a preacher he's in there reading Playboy magazines this was a great big Husky built white guy Luther Beck some of them here knows him he grabbed that guy and he slammed him against the office and he said he's not reading that he's studying on something that he is preaching on as his church and you know that was never mentioned again he was willing to fight that man over me Tom asked him one day when he found out that Tom knew about brother brandham Tom said how did you learn about he said Sam Dale he said what do you think of Sam Dale on a scale from 1 to 10 he said he's an 11 that's what he said because he knew what I was day by day but church do you understand what the new birth is you've got to hear the word it's got to clean that unclean Spirit out it's not because you quit drinking you quit smoking you quit doing those things it's when that inside man drives out through the spirit through into the body and it cleanses you by the washing of the water of the word that's right yeah and then you got the birth of a baby you know what we don't like that but it's still true I don't care how old you were the day you reive the new birth you got the new birth as a baby Desiring the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby you may think you had a lot of head knowledge I could quote a lot of the Bible studied the Bible that was my whole thing but yet I realized and brother Mo said brother Dale I can't figure you out he said there something he said I know you're not trying to find some something that you could do or not do and it would bring you to a Salvation that you'd accept he said but you got to remember one thing he said he is the word and said the new birth is the birth of that word and you know that was it that was the day I received the new birth you know what that come to me as a revelation the new birth was no longer a mystery it was something that had been revealed to me did you understand everything no still don't ever understand everything but I saw Christ as the word and I said Thank You Lord my wife right beside of me fell one way and I fell the other way we all kind of laugh about it cuz there was no drunk sitting on the front row down at Holly Hots and he was at sitting on that front row and when we got down to pray and I went fell one way and she fell the other way and she fell right under that old drunk's feet he was just looking at her he trying to get over you know but you know what it didn't bother her she didn't get upset excuse me I'll go lay down somewhere else you know no she didn't I have no control over that it just ended that situation she brought it back to me last night she said you've always taught that it's the birth of the word well I can't see any other birth what is it that's right you explain to me what it is you tell me something that Satan can't impersonate right but what did Brother R say the thing he can't do he can't bring the word word by word he said he can't do it that's right I hope I hope you understand if not I wish you would do me a favor and go back and listen to this tape about three times before you say anything to anybody else that I don't agree with brother Dale because of so and so and so and so would you go back and listen to the tape and see if what I said you owe me that respect but you won't do it you'll go away telling people you don't agree with that cuz I believed that I believe when I got it I cried I was there today I got well I ain't saying you didn't get it right but I'm saying one thing for certain may I quote brother Brandon he said if you got the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues he said it is not according to the Bible now do you need that quote he said it's not according to the Bible see because we put the tongues and the things the head put the birth first and then shout and Glory Hallelujah all you want to cuz what did we read when we reading brother Brown said it's a life he never done away with saying that the evidence of the Holy Ghost was the Life of Christ show me that but we want to say that well he done away because it could be the love anybody man fact love but he never taught that it wasn't an experience and that the Life of Christ was supposed to live in us after the New Birth comes because before then we're only saying what somebody else said amen that's right you can't call Jesus the Christ except by the Holy Ghost I quote the prophet except by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth cuz you're saying what somebody else says forgive me for being hard this afternoon but remember 40 something years I've tried to explain this I'm not against nobody I love everybody no matter what you do to me or have done to me or whatever that has nothing to do with anything and this man you're looking at because this man has one thing in the mind and that is to try to serve Jesus Christ and I know I make the statement and you don't some people don't like it but the men that's helped me the most in this message was the men that hurt me the most can you say that can you say that the ones that helped you the most was the ones that hurt you the most no you say the ones I don't don't like was one to hurt me you know they made you think they made you consider they made you pray I've always told you we were referring to it last night I was a kind of a person and I'll finish with this thought I could understand in the old days that when they they would just get a word of mouth and you don't get mad at each other what and they would just take their handkerchief out and they'd just slap a man in the face with a handkerchief and I'll meet you in the morning at daylight you know what man would go and they'd take two guns and they'd stand off certain Paces with each other and they shot each other I can understand that because the greatest insults you can give a person is to slap their jaws don't please slap your children in the jws get you a I know the football guy got into trouble by using a little paddle but at least nobody hadn't gotten into trouble yet using a little Hickory so get you a little Hickory and kind of work on the other end you know surprisingly it gets back up to the head right but don't slap them in the Jaws my brother-in-law hit my nephew so hard underneath until he knocked his intestines out don't do it you get mad but you see I always wondered if somebody slap my jaws could I take it and I have had ever right to hurt a man that work because I've told you about it he kept pinching me between the legs in the wrong place and I told him over and over don't do that we don't play games now that's wrong for you to touch somebody in the wrong place don't do it now and I caught him one day sitting on the table and I meant to I didn't pray to be forgiven before I went and done it I just knew what I was going to do and I went over and I put my hands on his knees and I looked him in the eye and I raised up and if you want to hurt somebody do that to him when I came down he came off of that table straight up cuz it was just total I mean I bounced him off the table and when he did he slapped my jaws plow not easy I stood and looked at him I grin at him never said a word he just slid off that table and he he went to work he never touched me again in the wrong place but you know he stayed away from me about an hour or so I guess he figured he needed to let me calm down you know but you know what I never had no part or thought about hitting him back I said Thank You Lord I needed that you ever heard brother Brown say that God will let somebody say something to you to see how you'll react okay but if you don't understand the New Birth please please put me in question we'll do it next Sunday we'll go through this again next Sunday to make sure you understand what I'm trying to bring and bring your questions and bring your thoughts that's fine with me I love it I love to talk to you about what you believe and what you think about be glad to discuss it in any form with you but I ain't going to argue with you I'm just going to present God's word and believe it go somewhere God's going to get to where he's supposed to in all of us sir it may be that we've got to go by the grave because we can't come now see I could stay another hour if you want me to at least cuz remember being born again means after you're born again something's taking place now that unclean spirit is drove out of the soul but that unclean spirit is still dwelling in our body and our spirit even till this day now if you don't agree with that there's something wrong with you even mentally speaking because he still has those accesses and he's still working in every way to try to control us will it ever come brother Dale it we'll get to a place that the devil won't bother us yeah in the Millennium in heaven that's come on that's what I say I'm sorry for being able to quote brother Brown says you will always be a sticker he doesn't say we have to he just says we will we'll be a sticker as long as we're in this flesh come on brothers with the communion let's stand together let's don't have nothing but we'll go right straight into the communion I'm sorry I didn't mean to I just wanted to get it off to where you could think about and you'll a lot of you will remember that I have taught these things cuz you'll remember the messages and some of you'll be able to come back next week and say I heard you in 1975 when you said this
