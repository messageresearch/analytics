========================================

before you throw in one slug from last time this is the last time what I'm talking about sheep from the reflection was an auditory I got a thing about it I'll actually paying him a compliment but the reason I did that I was thinking about you know what the fact that all of us as humans are sheep nature I tried to get that point across to y'all we all have a sheep nature and God intended for that that wasn't an accident you know so that we would seek Him and as a shepherd well when you become a Christians may you're like a black sheep because you're so hot you don't know what I'm talking about when you're ready to work with the world yes the workplace and schooling but and anywhere in public they're always a black sheet you really stand down so that's the point I was making on that but it's interesting if you look at that little nursery around says baa baa black sheep have you any wool yes sir yes sir three bags full so I thought well there's justification sanctification depth in the Holy Spirit all the other three did you think about it thank you bond that you put that black sheep in there no I was on the Internet that's all about for now we're gonna go back to into our lesson about humility for a while and I want to review the first few slides put in some new slides up and then we'll start where I left off last time so the objective is to understand what it means to humble ourselves before the Lord a couple of definitions humble means having or showing a modest or low estimate of one's own importance and then the verb like action is to destroy the independence power or will of and especially when emphasizes the will we humble ourselves about denying our own pleasure and our own will and seeking the will of the Lord Satan promised seven if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land Psalm 69 32 the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek God isaiah 57:15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contract ones well speed through these first 20 or 30 s live really quick because I have a lot of sausage and there's my last lesson I think Matthew 18 for whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and Matthew 23:12 and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself should be exalted James 4:6 but a giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud will give us grace unto the humble or verse 10 humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and he shall lift you up first Peter 5:5 likewise ye are submit yourselves into the hill there yeah all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble or sixth humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time and in the Strong's definition this the gillip are base cast down humble of low degree estate and lowly as a condition lonely of low degree brought low with grief depressed lowly in spirit humble there are many misconceptions about what it means to be humble humble is often thought to me simple or shallow this common thought may lead to slothfulness or laziness towards God as was once stated by brother Dale there is the difference between simplicity and stupidity we talked about that last time on the contrary to humble ourselves before God can mean many things but perhaps the best summation of these is to submit our whole life and our will to Jesus Christ now how did this live in the other day so this is just me as a student I'm not anything special I'm just trying to basically and place emphasis on one part of humility so the best way I know to describe this is to break it up into three parts three types or three forms with humility the natural humility and that's like the statute man we've been talking about there's some natural knowledge or a red I guess you say temperance some people are naturally can control their temper and so work better than others and something will naturally have patience and things like that well there's a natural humility too you know some people in your life that aren't even Christians that are really humble everybody knows somebody that's really humble but that doesn't do away with the part of us still needing the humility of Jesus Christ we still need the character development the humility of God humility there's also humility develop during your Christian journey that's important that that's not exactly what I'm talking about today either and you just develop that as you go as you take on these virtues and the stretch man you begin to the agency also Mohammed is the attitude choice talks humility choose them to be humble and you do that several times a day every day maybe in time we could come up in a situation where you have a little bit of free time and you can do something leisurely like read a novel or read your Bible you know which do you give your time to you know you can please the flesh more entertaining or you can more you know such your affection on things above that's what I'm talking about is the attitude choice of humility and there's other ways to do that several times a day but you know that isn't day we think Isaiah 40:31 but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint this includes prayer or meditation certitude fasting studying listening and many other acts of love and obedience now these are ways we choose humility as I will say many go deny pleasures and self-will so things that appeal to the flesh temporal things that seem important now but don't hold their internal wave glory and then admit false and beliefs and deeds so they lost and it's hard for one man Thank You quarter brother branham and saying it's hard for a one for for one man to believe another you know it's hard to get no man to believe another man because we all have this pride in this sense of self-righteousness and that we're right and what we've always believed is right and it's hard to humble that Downing's and still now website this person has something here from the Lord so admit that you're wrong in your belief and and admit that you're wrong in your deeds when you do something wrong for someone those are both ways we choose humility as an part of our Fremont agency with my choice all right and then prefer others before ourselves that goes without explanation and then waiting on God for revelation and other blessings this might get touchy not my mom I'm not really throwing off on anybody of like but there's been people that we've all seen that have come here and set for just a short little while and then before you know they throw up a hand to say you can't understand anything brother bill says and they walk out the door and disgust and some people probably walk away and that's what I like to say if you don't understand well don't take the wraps down with you but you know people are a little more humble when they walk away bull they cut down and just say I'm just not I just don't understand and leave but to me the humblest thing you can do is to just sit and listen and if you don't understand just pray and ask God to give you a revelation and give them some time I'll just give brother Dale town I'm gonna give dog town to help you but it's prob - man's got a problem all over it when someone throws up their hands they bless God you can understand anything that this five minutes on full ministry says and they walk away then they try they tell other people you can't understand brother Dale don't you you know listen brother Dale someone told Gaby that you can't understand brother Dale he's off the word and so she had that free I guess prejudice or disposition from the very start when she started coming here that she was told by someone she highly esteemed the brother Dale was wrong so she had a lot going against her what does that was a lot of little things going against her but yet she chose humility she chose to be humble and sit and listen for a little while and find by she understood she began to understand things when she had been told that he wasn't even right you know so it goes down to we're not any better than the people who have left here we don't have any less product than they have we've just chose to suppress the pride in ourselves and and choose humility and say no I'm gonna listen for a little while safe this man because you know Bella Dell really late for what it preaches you know these powerful masters believe what they preach so it's just a matter of saying god he's right and you can reveal to me what you reveal to him so that takes humility you just humble yourself now it's a choice many people may feel that to be humble means that we should not study because we are trying to figure things out on our own like Eve did instead of waiting on God this is a misconception about humility reading studying and listening to sermons is not the way of trying to figure things out in your home studying the Word of God is actually necessary for us to do in order for God to reveal his word to us is part of our reasonable service and you know the scripture about reasonable service I read that to y'all last time my little best man poor people this is where I left off from believe last time so brother members or people Joseph and Mary both real poor and here there was in this little stable how humble God makes himself and then when we try to make ourselves something great can't you see how humble how God humbles himself and takes the things that's not that he might bring to pass his straight pulses how that little Jehovah legen a man wrapped in the cloth taking off the back of the yoke the neck of a yoke where the office had been and wrapped the Prince of Peace in my poor way then what do we do and this is a continuation of that if God can hold himself like that one week to be able to humble ourselves to become his servant if he did things like that can we forget our great dignities and things of this world and past from that and humble ourselves before him this Christmas and they show him our appreciation of that birth and that humanity by humbling our own selves and receiving his work no matter what the tradition said is his word that counts that's what he'll take his word in that home and the message locally says the way out is down here to hold himself to be exalted I hear that his awesome self should be abased we must humble ourselves not try to know too much just know one thing focus everything else out of the way looking to Christ if you don't know how to write your name that don't have one thing to do it just focus your heart to Christ and his will and watch what happens this is me how could God be just were failure if you made a Bible that could only be understood by smart people on the contrary it can only be understood by babes and that our deal is for joy some spirit and said take I think they'll follow the law of heaven without forbid hid these things from the house the wild green has to build them on the bags even so far so it seemed good in my sight we desire the understanding revelation of the seal sandwich the veil and other mysteries contained in the word I'll make this point last time just redirect but do we study those things how can we expect other Avila's mysteries if we don't ever read the seal book the name sudden week week sport and so forth your main gotta kind of keep going and revolving on those those books the like the the dam the dam same weeks we read that all the way through together and then we go to the seven sails and we go to the church a book and then we are back over again and just all these series we keep them going because we're doing a comic play on our field you know we're making things ready making ourselves prepared for the Lord to reveal it to us and that's what I believe in don't set the silver boundary donors themselves just stay in it you know and constantly keep reading now we're like a woman claiming to be expecting a child I made that point last time yeah never knowing a man we the bride's should not expect a new birth birth of the word if we don't consecrate our lives to God and spend time with the word man we must study the Word of God now say to me through 14 states show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth and then just gonna read the yellow here this is about the perilous sword see but bless their house that they see in their ear so they hear but he that received seed in the good ground see that here is the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty and some thirty how would you prepare your ground receive the Word of God homely yourself by sacrificing the care of this world your own ideas business that have an ear to hear that's a meek humble spirit ready to listen and willing to admit when you're wrong now see and then Miliband on the way back he said now we don't have to be smart we don't have to be educator we have to believe we have to humble ourselves and empty ourselves for God to manifest itself through us empty up yourself get yourself all the way the biggest enemy you have is yourself now you believe God you do it now this is one of those quotes from one of our ministers here again so named that creature I think this gonna be pretty obvious when the word comes then you should say Lord is that in me because it hides y'all memory talked about that last time when you believe something you don't even realize you believe until the minister stands up and exposes that and you and then you start silhouetting you realize I believe that that's because it has but is that in me yep that's in you a preacher will tell you that yeah that's in you he'll preach a sermon and you'll go man I need to what move over a little bit hey I need to stand here and let that thing go away but here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes the white horse right that's why your new birth is emotion important thing without the new birth guess what you'll thank you're right if you don't have the reverse you're automatically inclined to thank your riders then trying self-righteousness something you'll thank you're right saying thanks he is right you'll make you think you're right that's what that's why that the seals has to tie in with the statue of perfect man that's not the virtue of a man of a human that's the virtue of God that's not the knowledge of a human that's the knowledge of God amen that's what's got to be born in here anybody have a guest who said that our master but way on the first sale part to de-rank this was real obvious because he says his name right in the middle of the quote so I think on this one so make your colleague and make your election sure well how can I do that brother Dale it's just pray to God and think about him and listen study the word and think on God so that's brother Dale I'm calling chosen he is talking about making your calling and election sure here a while back I was that last middle of last month so I see in that it's just pray to God sustained Communion prayer think about him there's meditation listen to sermons and listen here study the word read your Bible thank on God you know we don't put enough emphasis I think on meditation meditation is really powerful just sitting still and just thinking about God and why put a time limit on that you know we shouldn't say well I'll just give God 10 minutes a day of meditation that's not a whole lot I mean get very far Hebrews chapter 7 brother Branham said therefore God reveals not to the world not to the psychologist not to the educated ministers but to the humble in heart has people who is make he will reveal these secrets of the great things of God to them you see it I here comes another one of these named night creatures so that's the danger zone right there all right kind of guess who that might be say that that's the danger zone right there when you come to church and you feel like you've done your religion you've done your religion for the week and you've gone through all the exercises and you've gone home and you say well I'm just as good as the other one there well there's someone else there that's dying to themself and soaking up the work and they're going home and they're studying when and when they sit in church they don't complain about how long the minister chrétien they're eating it up and that's the difference between carnal and the spiritual and that's how close it is in this day it's going to be so close where Judas was putting his arm around the word and saying I believe the same thing you do I'm casting out Devils I'm doing college town stuff and he's sitting right there among the amongst the people who do you think said that those two guests but above I think ya don't really supposed to build against this I'm just think eventually you know a little thunder you might catch the little phrase in there that only belongs to one minister like if I put up something says sugar tip you will know as brother Dale or some kind of little wackadoo that's weird Bob words food for God this is many okay all the greatest things we can achieve in this life required humility perseverance and discipline so like anything you try to achieve learning the instrument learn a certain career or anything that's you know really worth having you have to put yourself into it so why would they expect to give them any less than these to God in order to attain to the greatest blessing for them my brother Dale always says you can't make it so easy that people fall into it it's not something you're going to stumble into for redemption north it's so hard we can attain to it but there's a way made we just have to do our part and you know thankfully this is another ministry here and you know Saints what we need to do is we just need to give in to what he's doing don't reason it don't think about it your own way think about it God's Way look at it through God's eyes look at it through his word and I believe he'll finish that word in you amen and he'll finish that he'll perfect that word in you amen praise God now I believe by the way it was January 24th all right now these are what I call this place of humility we see them in the Bible we see them in the message we saw brother Branham I see him here we see them all around us these are pictures of four examples of humility that's what I'm talking about sir we're see Jesus brother membership week we find out that the Bible wrote in such common language he must have used the grammar that was used on the street talking about Jesus this just a common people because the boss said the common people heard him gladly see so many the intellectuals could not associate themselves in such a common person that's both withdrawals I'll get em that were Perriman and so forth that perhaps he did so it was a little too much for them it is yet today God humbles himself God his humility the manikin humble himself is on it rode up here that exalts himself is on the road down hallways that's Christianity humble yourself and if that Lockton reflecting us people will see Christ in you you see when they can see that so a draw I studies that work here in the Polka mango a drawl means speak in a low lazy way with prolonged vowel sounds we call that redneck or southern or whatever you'll know what I'm talking about all right well there wasn't anybody speaking redneck or southerner in Jerusalem or wherever you know Jesus was there was nobody would have been speaking like that always talking about anywhere you go that I know of in the world there's always the high-polished people who pronounce the words right use big words and then there's less educated people who use the draw and you know speak the language of the common people and I don't know but I would I would guess that Jesus would have learned to speak the way that Joseph and Mary raised him up as you know they weren't real high educated so he probably would have had some of these slangs were street slang or whatever you call it or drawers and such a way for the high-polish preached and think what do you want to hear but and you know we always think about the pretty Jesus in the movies where he's got this sort of you know ready please you know God pearly white teeth he's all decked out on nice and Verdi and then he's got this real you know like an English accent and some movies or a band or something and announces words all right was he would have been that way I don't know I mean I would have kind of think that he would speak more a little bit hunger than that and more like the calling people so that the people he was sent to would receive so you think about brother Brown stand up and say visions in the healing lines and so forth and so much God was used in him to where he didn't even know what he was saying did you ever notice I need those tapes for brother been praying for somebody and or or seeing a vision tell what's in the vision all suddeniy puts on a British accent and talks real polished and pronounces words right you see what I'm saying so God comes down and uses a humble man and uses his dialect his tongue his way of speech and that's hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent people would say well I can't bid God he wouldn't talk like that I was kind of my first thought when I heard program pray for somebody and said you know that God was using that man like that uh-huh how would he be speaking that way and being gone but that's how God can home himself that is the ultimate humility that Jesus Christ came down in the flesh and did all the things that he did here and use the drawl the common speech and that's where they where that scripture was that brother Brennan was quoting that from the common people heard him gladly when there's a lot of these in the book Lamar at least displays of humility and Jesus said over against the Treasury and he held how the people cash money the Treasury this honors summarizes this this is where the dawn cast in the two months right humility that's all she actually gave all her living humility she didn't hold back anything from the Lord the two men went up into the temple Luke 1810 pray one a Pharisee another public and the Pharisee stood and prayed doesn't themselves a god I think they are not pets other men or extortioners just unjust adulterers or even as this public you know fact twice in the week I give tithes of all that I possess now that's not humility at all that's the apex of pride he's bragging about what he's done and then the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much of his eyes into heaven but smote upon breast think I'll be merciful to me a sinner I'll tell you this man went down to us house justified rather than the other for everyone that is all themselves would be abased and he that homes home with new social be exalted okay team 15 and they brought unto Him also infants let's just read the yellow some for little children to come unto me and forbid them not throw such as the king of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God has this little child so no wise enter heaven you know a child believes what you tell them and they're also they're very meek very humble and so forth we have to be like children and they just they just believe look 18 skipping down the yellow again now when Jesus heard these things he said unto them under him yet this is the rich young ruler yet like a style one thing sell all the house and distribute to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me he's asking him to make the hunger choice in the rich young ruler wouldn't do it the sixth seal all this is about his brother Neville okay what here the pastor the brown Carbonite right he was the pastor of brown tabernacle and and brother brown pops about here even when he first come in brother Neville he's talking about he didn't understand the message then but he believed it and stayed right with it that's honor that's respect to a brother like that I can't say enough for him and now the Lord bless them so just talking about my example a while ago about how some people won't listen for five minutes or five months hardly but some of my brother Neville would just sit there and just listen until he understood that humility you suppose God selected such a man brother Neville for that special purpose because he knew brother Neville would reverence the Office of God's prophet and then the fifth seal this is really profound okay brother Branham speaking he actually told this story a couple years proud of this I don't know when this actually happened I think it was in 1961 it was laying there one morning in his bed next to medium heat she was still asleep and he brought herself up on the head of the bed and he said and I thought boy you are already 53 if you're going to do anything for God you better get doing it now right off the bat that's kind of loco to most of us because we know he had all these a compliments he was a major prophet he prayed for the sick and they were healed he won probably millions of souls to Jesus Christ and he would lay there in his bed and think now you haven't done anything thinking to himself you'd only done anything for Jesus Christ and talk about humility unlike that guy in the show a few slides ago who's bragging about his accomplishment around would actually have a lot of accomplishments and not even you know take credit for it here just sit there in civil order I've done anything for you because you're gonna be too old for after a while say and I thought you know that's right now I thought boy you know I ain't very far away I got to go pretty soon it's the best I say you're older than my daddy later see I thought I got to know the way pretty soon I saw it and here I ain't done nothing for him yet I thought I always want to do something wrong I thought I got to hurry up and do it if I'm gonna do it and I don't know how I'm gonna do it that's all you know right after that he went into the old curtain of time before arm his humility probably go before fall but before honor is humility he was honored by being able to go beyond the curtain of time and Schroeder after this the seal wasn't real to him so talk about honor you know but he was really humble right before these great honors and his life the apex of his ministry about the highest note his ministry and right before that he got so little they wouldn't count any of his accomplishments as being anything it was always kind of did more for the Lord I think we make it to this how about I was not good that long time I think we got to talk to this I won't play off a little bit of this story here because the story has humility written all over it hold on the same when high this boy has stepped out though the place is a rest awhile from the dancing got with these girls and he happily going out towards your crown I had one little girl kinda ragged looking and shed a dish pen full of water she washed the dishes and thought I never seen her before I wonder where she come from so he just lets it is waiting it around the side of the the book house where he'll never come back side of the growling Manor she's barefooted she spelled she held her head down she seen who it was and she was very shy she this great person and she was just a cousin to these other girls or her father was forming on this big armored outfit so they kept she kept looking down she shamed being barefoot he said what's your need she told and said why do you out there to the for the rest of his she kind of made excuses and so the next time he watched far again finally is sitting out there they all kind of carrying on her they eat he said on the crowd been some watch her come through the dishwater around and he watched her and he said to her he said you know my real purpose of eating here she said no Strato said my purpose of being here is hunt the one he said I find a character you that they don't head I saved the church there were you married she said me you me I can't think of such a thing and me see that's the maintenance boss's son of the old company isn't racist about the country everything's said that said yesterday I couldn't find one in Chicago I want a real life I want a wife with character and the vein that I'm looking for hi Steven you so with your marry me she said well it started her she said yes and he said well told her to be back so then you just make yourself ready here the day I'll be back hell and objets you know I'll take it away from here you only have to work like this no more I'll take you and I'll go to Chicago not a bit what you won't like you've never seen she said I never had a lot of a market he said he said I feel gentle for real but I'll be back he kept the tract with the new to the time of the year she worked everything that she could do to save enough money at her dollar a day or wider she had with her board the bomber wedding dress perfect type of the church and she got her garbage right yelling she displayed this wedding on her cousin said why you force dedicated you need to think that a man like that anything you do to you she said but he promised that it's probably that I bleed his work or he's just making a fool of you said uh Peter got somebody no wonder they put it there but he promised me I'm looking for I am so protected later and later the day finally arrived certain hour is be there so she dressed in her garment and she had even heard from but she nobody'd be there so she dressed up in her wedding clothes got things ready well then they really did like medicals Maine Boston sent it to the foreigner for today now that the girls heard of their bad so is this all of history saying to them that is too sure this girl miss face of ultimate on the basis of his word that he'd be back bar so they got the liability but throw a handrail would base or rivers AHA land video like it said for the city kids you just did there not a bit of blush the over flower and they're waiting overall Vicki is probably I hear that and the flower that always makes me think about the Berkshires you know the virtually recently acquired with climates time to perfect plan so we don't listen his bride has made herself ready fire there's the now I told you was wrong see income that I got five more minutes the new be here all of it is like just baptized they won't cop teach out the five minutes there are cars to the Gallatin and earlier the wheels they were brought forward stop she jumped from the tree he ran out the door he jumped out of carriage and she filled into his arms and said so cousin denomination's promise like that I'm called to prepare a place for you let me savor crazy but brother to eat right now be sealed breaking like this of the supernatural thing right here the sound makes a way into eternity there I'm almost an angel standing there saying it the legs that seven angels message time of the award little royal model in the arms of Jesus we take another time let's think of these things as may go long now nobody so the man in this story visit himself with the virgin girl because he found in her the character he was looking for that's what he came all way down there looking for he turned down those real Tonti you know real flirty girls and went after this one little girl ragged looking girl with the character what do you think that Lord has been doing with the little group of believers that spoken word church hasn't he busied himself with us hasn't he brooded over us surrounding us with science and wonders hasn't he hovered over us and brooded over us with love and grace bring us revelation of his word I'm not saying we're the only part of the bride now I'm not saying that you're saying we are part of why do you suppose he has visited himself with us so much what do you think he is doing couldn't he be making the proposal to you if he is making a proposal to you will you accept whether you become mrs. Jesus Christ and these are several are a whole bunch of quotes about brooding I think whether they'll talk to us alone a while back but it's the burning of the Holy Ghost is for month some people can't keep the victory trying to say do you love me but you believe me and if he brought me what I am without me having any more any choice how much more when they give me back my life with eternal life with it if I brought back to him and say yes Holy Spirit I don't care what the world says I love you I love you I love you oh no that cloud is your did show up do you know there is I forgot how to do like that you don't know anything about this cloud that was over spoke more Church in 2015 and you remember in Flagstaff Arizona this is the one from Flagstaff Arizona 1963 very 28 I know we don't follow signs but signs fallen believers and there may not even be anything to that I believe in it I believe the Lord was telling us something but I'm not following that problem that I'm believing in the revelation is coming forth there are signs and wonders all over the places the northern ones at the end time was a lot more Sanko make happen we've had dead rage sick healed and we've gone brought back and curses brought back and trees spoken down and all kind of things that have happened and those are all signs those are good especially notice them the Word of God is being revealed that's the birding of the Holy Spirit then why is he standing here hovering over us like that is what I'm asking he sent His Holy Spirit now but he's brooding over the place trying to bring us back to first to be back to herself to be reborn again to be sons and daughters of God to take God at His Word to believe God's Word that's another one about brooding Oh duration this is a locus arte no Jerusalem group so much kills the prophets and stones thing that are sending the house and what I've gathered together as a hand duster fruit under her wings and you would not hold your house is left unto you desolate and verily I say unto you you shall not see me until the time you shall say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord could the Lord say the same thing to us at spoken word Church he's only obligated to his word thus we must accept his word to be a part of him could we tarry too long in our unbelief and the Lord passes by he has long-suffering but he won't be with us forever today is the day of salvation known in that person and then Hebrews chapter 7 for the venison now say that's old people o people how oft the Holy Spirit would have covered you as a hand of a brood but you went you want your own way and you're going to have your own way about it that's nice magrib along so I'm going to cut it off but this is brother Charles Spurgeon we like to look up some Spurgeon at home every now and then and read and he's got a lot to say about humility also so maybe we'll put that the next time I see you sometime any questions I'll be upstairs [Music]
