don't you good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scripture turn back where we've been reading from Revelations 1 try to get into the service now remember I know it's already been announced and everything but remember to pray for sister Trudy and the family there that and the loss of their son there he passed away this past Sunday and so just remember that they'll be having a memorial service on December the 12th and so that'll be where we can't go or anything but uh you know we just pray that the Lord would bless and we'll try to at least send them some money and and to help them and you know and do things like that but just just just remember the family I know that it's kind of a shock to him he had been sick for quite a while but still it was just kind of a a shock for it to come so quick so remember that his name was Terry just pray that the Lord would would bless sister Trudy and the family all right uh now remember next Wednesday the this coming this next Wednesday brother uh Eugene Collins will be here preaching for us and then on Sunday brother forny will be here preaching for us and we're we will be leaving Wade and brother Donnie and I will be leaving on Monday and we're hoping that we can get back in on Sunday uh it's just according because it's a about a 19-hour drive but uh we'll do the best we can we'll just do whatever we can do so remember that and let's remember us as we're traveling amen all right I know Terence has already made all the other announcements and things so remember these things I F anything that I forgetting remember to pray for my wife she's been having a lot of trouble with her back and then all at once wo it's hit her again that she can't sleep so you know uh she's sitting up last night I just turned the tape player on and she listened to services from you know brother brandom from about 11:00 to 5:00 this morning for you know trying to and can't sleep so just pray that the Lord would would give her sleep and and comfort un it amen John 1 Lord Jesus we thank you for all things and we pray that you would just bless us with your love and understanding and Lord first of all that you'd forgive our sins and just cover Us by the blood because we always want to remember that we ask you now to come tonight and just speak to our hearts and our lives that we may see you Lord and be guided in your understanding as we read your word you come and speak to us by the word that we may be able to speak about you and just bless those that are not here remember the sick among us and just come you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so remember that just touch your wife Lord and give her strength in the body and then give her sleep tonight Lord and we we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated I believe the time time is at hand because it's a time to understand now if you have your things I ran off 10 extra copies and just in case uh but if you have your copy you were supposed to bring them back with you uh to tonight uh from Sunday but if you don't have a make sure the ones that that don't have a copy get a copy of the quotes a lot of the quotes is things that we have quoted many times but we're just trying to put it all together in one line and to be able to uh speak about something and and it's going to take us now quite a while to be able to um speak in on this so I pray that you won't get bored uh hearing it and that you will uh you know that it'll be of interest to you uh you know we read our in the scriptures as we was trying to cover Sunday and we had a good in a company so I had to kind of you know walk around a little bit different than what I wanted to bring but uh we still I believe got the point across about what I wanted to bring now uh I say this again because I don't want you to think that I am uh you know just this that or the other I've been studying on this point of the Book of Revelations and you know it because this is message number uh five tonight and I've been speaking on this for quite a while so it's not just that someone comes along and says something and then you know uh I jump up and start on something to do that if you believe it's that way then that's up to you I can't convince you any other way uh Wade read a quote the other day and I want to try to get that quote uh that he read where brother brandham said he said if God if you can't do something with him I can't do it right so that's you know I want that quote because that's the way I've always been I've always been burdened because that uh you know two or three times in my life I've had to deal with situations that other people would have entirely dealt differently and you know and things like that but I I I can't deal the way you deal I have to be the way I am and doing it like that then sometimes I might not satisfy you about the way things are done but just remember I'm the one responsible so you know it's always burdened me and I used to pray Lord if you can't touch the people what can I do right and you know people say well just go tell them well where's it ever settled anything to go to somebody and tell them you know it just won't work you say oh yes it will just come and tell me brother I had two brothers in The Minister's meeting one time and they was both up talking and both of them said just tell me like it is I got up behind them I said you two don't want me to tell it like it is I mean you know they just kept on about it I said you two don't want me to tell it like it is right because it would be contrary to both of them you know I would have been saying things that they wouldn't have liked but that's just my nature and my ways I'm sorry that's me but you know a lot of people believe and it's not just because of um somebody as I said come through and make a statement about something but a lot of people believe that that brother randam was the one to that come to John on patmas and revealed a book to John and their statement is because that he was a prophet and the word comes to the prophet well all right now whether that be true or not I don't lay emphasis upon that my emphasis upon one thing I want to know who came to brother brandham right that's because if I can get to the point to see who came to brother brandham and really who it was right that came to brother brandham then I don't believe we'll be concerned too much about whether brother brandham come to John or not that would be uh you know another point I know what the prophet has said I know what he made the statements and things and we'll get to it eventually uh you know of what he said but what I want to do is go through the Book of Revelation cuz that was my intentions has always been to go through the Book of Revelations in this point about where that the scripture said that he sent and signified by his Angel unto John amen now I believe that there was an angel come to John O Baptist amen yes sir now I believe that because the scripture said it all right and I I believe that uh you know brother randam had an angel all right that came to him I believe is that amen all right and but the main point I want to get is I've always believed that the Bible and that's the reason I gave you the quotes right up front there I believe the Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ amen amen now if we are part of that right then all right we're we can be revealed and made known all right amen but if we're not part of that Revelation then we have got a problem you know so I'm trying to find the revelation of Jesus Christ and then when it comes to that place that we get to the point then uh we won't worry about some of the other things because you know uh as I said this is not something new it's something that's been around the message for a long time well all right now I'm just I'm honest and this way I talk plain if it was brother randam it come to John on patas okay all right but where's that going to put us in Rapture if we don't know the Revelation that come to John O Batman right now if it's not revealed to me and you that's right see just because brother around preached it do you automatically have itess that's what I want to prove tonight cuz we're going to stay in this for a while but we're going to stay in it going through the Book of Revelations because I believe it's very vital to understand right there are are uh many things said in the Book of Revelation and I think will be very helpful unto us about these things all right now as one who is a Believer I believe in angels right amen I believe in angels am the prophet of God said ever born again believer now he didn't say everybody in the world right see we used to you know we had pictures all over every little baby and all over this that the other well brother Brown didn't explain that but he did explain that all born again Believers have Angels right all right now so you can say well all born again Believers have the Holy Ghost well that's true cuz it all going to have to tie together because if it's an angel from God right that is given unto you and I and we'll get to that when we get more in the scripture then that angel coming from God would be a part of God right amen would you not agree because the scripture calls it uh ministering Spirits sent forth for the hours of Salvation now that's a paraphrase but we'll get back to that scripture later but what I want to do is just get step by step through the Book of Revelations and I believe you'll begin to see a picture unfold and the picture that I want to unfold to you is one thing brother Ram had an angel right sure followed him from birth that's right appeared to him right as about a 200 lb man dressed and he seen him and everything talk with him that angel told him many things like what serpent seed was what different things was that angel directed him and told him I'd always be with you and but why didn't that angel tell him about the seals he had to have a visitation y of an Angel to tell him about the seals that's my point that's what I want you to see and you'll see that it'll unfold one of the most beautiful pictures that's right that has ever been to mankind because why didn't that angel tell him he had the Holy Ghost Why didn't it tell him come on that's right that's right John had the Holy Ghost when he's on P why didn't they tell him all about that that's right you have the Holy Ghost do you know everything no we'll automatically admit we don't see that's why I tried to preach about even that the Lord Jesus by his own ways of doing being almighty God he limited himself to word that he wouldn't even know when he's coming back right you said well that was just the flesh well don't just lay on all of it just being the flesh tie it together with the whole entire being right I mean don't you think that he could override the flesh he surely did and could tell them everything y right but you see that's where that I don't believe that we're following the message to see the real importance of what has happened in this in this last days h now to approach it then as I said get this point drive it hard into your mind if that was brother brandham that come to John on Pat where would that put you in the Rapture right well it might be oh yeah come on come on you was fixing to say it'd make me believe him better now butd if you can't believe brother randam was a prophet without thinking he come to John on pmas you're in bad shape that's right amen I'm in terrible shape amen if you can't believe God kept his word straight right you're in terrible shape amen now that's as blunt as I can be not to try to do anything or whatever but I wrote this down you know we better deal with who came to brother Brandon and who told Brother brandom all of these things now what I want to prove tonight is one point if the the if brother brandham came to join patas where did he get what he brought to John right that's right are you with me amen where'd he get it you said what it got it from the Lord Jesus well now let's just prove that in the Bible now let's prove it in the the scriptures that we've been talking about now I tried Sunday like I said with company M how in the world could I go through something so I done the best I could you go back and listen to that but just don't discard the message right because there's a lot of things said right that you need to have of understanding all right but you see now listen it's there on your quotes page 13 of church age book that brother brandham said that the Book of Revelations is the only book it's Church age book P 13 I think it's uh one two or three of you notes okay let me look up here and get it number one on your notes page 13 it's a revelation of Jesus Christ given to John for Christians of all ages it's the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus himself though personally appearing to ascribe through personally appearing to ascribe right it's a revelation of the person of Christ that's right but it's not just the revelation of the person of Christ right on down below there see the uncovering is not not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it's the revelation of his Future Works in the oncoming seven Church ages amen look down at number two on your notes what a great day is ahead of us friends the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave to his Angel and come and signified it to John that it might be known through the church ages the thing that is in store for us why because it says there in Revelation 1 the Revelation that God gave to Jesus to give to John he said signified by an Angel so there's an angel involved all right you got all of the quotes that goes through but go down to number five on your notes and look at it Christ revealed in his own word 1965 but it's the revelation of Jesus Christ God himself revealed from word to flesh that's what it is the Bible is the word and God is the flesh God God is the word rather and Jesus being the F amen it's a revelation how God the word was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us and that's why he become a Son of God he is a part of God now so let's just take now before we we get into the thought that I want you to get for the night I want you to just follow me in the scriptures all right follow me who's talking let's go through I've done this one time you know but let's go through to get this lined up together at one time I want you to look at it now who wrote who was this in re in uh writing in Revelations 1 1 through three that was John right right John was writing down right what he was told now watch it go from John writing down to an angel talking to John to Jesus coming on the scene right because I'll go ahead and say it to you any Revelation you think you got if Jesus Christ won't come on the scene to that Revelation then it is not a revelation that's right blunt plain don't need interpreting does it right now so verse 1 2 and 3 John is telling you see blessed is he that readeth this is John talking right you all right then what does it say John to the seven Church ages the angel was telling John to the seven Church ages Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before the strong and watch that an angel is telling John a great Revelation watch it in just a minute CU we'll prove that if Jesus don't come to your Revelation is not a revelation that's what I'm trying to prove verse 5 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and ha made us Kings and Priests unto God and and and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever behold he cometh with clouds and every ey shall see him they also which pierced him and all Kindred of the Earth shall whail because of him even so amen and the angel is bringing a great Revelation to John of Jesus Christ right he describes him up there in verse four from him which is and which was and which is to come now watch Jesus when he steps on the scene you say did Jesus step on the scene well verse 8 says red letters so that means Jesus speaking when you see it in the Bible that's what we're supposed to believe the red letter means Jesus is talking I believe God's talking all the way through but you know I'm just telling it like it is verse eight I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending listen sayith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty amen they come and verify that what the angel said was true right the angel said up there this is the one that which is and which was which is to come now Jesus steps on the scene now that's not just an Angel that's Jesus stepping on the scene because the angel proclaimed it correctly that's what gets me about the people that say brother brandom was all messed up before the seals broke then the seals had to come straighten him out and I'd like to see that but they won't come and tell you where it's at oh yeah they attack like the church age book and say the 17 contradiction I've invited on tape and everywhere else to come and show me the 17 contradictions there till this day nobody's contacting me about it listen now what's it what he jumps back says I John now John's going to tell you what he's doing now the angel has delivered the message the angel has delivered the message to John that God gave him to deliver of who of Jesus Christ is that what we just read the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him God was giving him a revelation here brother R said he didn't even understand that in those quotes right there at the beginning of it he didn't understand his part in the Kingdom but said when he come to John on patmas then he knew see he' come from the pillar of fire and went back to the pillar of fire he come from God and went back to God why because he's God the whole time right but he was displayed all right so follow me now John talks John said I John who is also your brother and companion in Tri in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle of that is called patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as a of a trumpet I gave you a quote somewhere in your reading that John knew who that was amen I can find it as I go through if I don't it'll be any notes or you just read every one of them and what did he say and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet what's who's this this is not an angel this is the Lord Jesus Christ No Angel could say I am Alpha and Omega come on no angel could say what John said he said to John up here that he's the one that which is and which was and is to come no angel can say that about himself it was the Lord Jesus amen so no matter who come to John on patas we better be concerned about the message that he brought or else you're just in idolatry so follow me that's what I'm trying to prove that's the whole thing I've Got Tonight is to show one thing that even though an angel would step right down here tonight and tell us something it still takes the Holy Spirit to reveal what that angel said amen cuz that Angel brother Rand couldn't reveal nothing to you even Jesus said come on quote your Prophet brother brand said Jesus said even my own life did not reveal that unto thee why right I think it's uh ano some Christ Ministry I believe it's 74 then brother R said the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word right that's right no angel can't reveal you the word no Prophet can't reveal you the word that's right he can only express to you and I in the words right amen yeah but brother Dale we got what the prophet said amen do you know what that'll do that'll drive us to hell if it's not revealed amen if it's not revealed what good is it right right good look right John in verse 99 and 10 he's telling where he's at and what he's doing and he heard behind him a great voice as of a trumpet let's see if I can find it I'll run across it a minute but brother rown saids it like this said he didn't turn to see the person he knew what which number is it you got the notes you can read faster than I can okay number 14 on your notes which is 49 of the church age book The patmas Vision page 49 Revelation 1:12 and I turned to see the voices spake with me and being turned I saw seven gold and Candlestick John does not say that he turned to see the one who voice he heard right he knew that voice but he didn't turn to see that voice he knew he was there in a vision but he turned listen he didn't turn to one whose voice he heard but he turned to see The Voice y I like that he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one in the same he knew that was almighty God Amen he knew who that was talking to him but the surprise was is what he saw I've preached this before to you right verse 11 saying I Alpha and Omega the first and the last see a prophet can't say that an angel can't say that right only God can say those things what th see us right in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto s and unto pergamus and unto tar and un artist under Philadelphia and under lady AA and watch and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks now he didn't turn to see the person like knowing it was Jesus you understand he turned to see The Voice cuz the voice and the person is the same that's right the seven golden candlesticks has got to be the the same as he is why because he and them that's why in verse 13 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks One Life unto the son of man now I've got it in here somewhere if I don't I'll get back to it maybe Sunday he saw the glorified Son of God you see he saw one in the midst of seven gold C like another son of man that's what he saw amen cuz it wasn't the son of man it was the glorified Son of God you got son that's god well don't don't get all tied up just think about what's being said where is he to be glorified according to your Prophet he's to be glorified in me and you that's right cuz he's already glorified right that's right glorify thy name already glorified it glorify it again come on and in the midst of seven can seven candlesticks one like another son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pouch with a golden girdle watch now if you'll get this one I wrote it somewhere down in my notes I wish youd read the Sevenfold Glory of his person it's in the church age book I'll find it in a minute but if you can find it in the church AG book if you'll turn over about page 13 14 you'll start 15 turn just keep turning you'll see it s says the Sevenfold Glory of his person but now remember the point you remember what we brought out we brought out what that this was Judgment Day we've done been through this cuz he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day the Lord's day is not the Sabbath yet the prophet will call it the Sabbath The Lord's day is not Saturday the Lord's day is the Judgment Day you remember I preached a message just the other week on it or when I preached back on it some time ago that it was the Judgment Day you're looking at see cuz this is the bride of Christ sitting on the Judgment exactly like the Book of Daniel but when he turns to see it what did he see right come on we've been through it before haven't we look at number 10 on your notes paragraph 167 Patman Vision 60 1960 1204 the evening service here's more proof that this Doctrine is right about the Lord's day did you notice him he was not a priest during this time neither was he King he was a judge you remember how I went through it the message is titled the Lord's day if you didn't get it go back and listen to the message the Lord's day is the Judgment Day the white Throne judgment that's right cuz that's when it fits all of the scriptures and fits Daniel notice a priest a high priest when he went into the sanctuary and went in or went in to minister to serve he tied himself around the waist tying his girdle around the waist meant that he was serving never tied it over his shoulder but here he comes out walking out with a girdle tied around the top with a s over his shoulders gted about the pouch the breast so that's not masculine it's feminine right with a golden girdle gted up high what is it an attorney of Judge a judge with his sash over his shoulder gted up here not just not down as a priest see that he shows he wasn't in his priesthood now he went all the way over into the Lord's day and saw him coming as the judge so now when you're looking at Revelations 1 you went all the way over to the Judgment Day with it that's right amen if you can see what I'm talking about see then the angel can bring the message but who's going to be setting in judgment amen you and I right but who's on the throne right judgment when over into judgment I gave you some more quotes on that CU Patman Vision number 12 on your notes sonone of righteousness healing in in his wings and now his countenance he was a judge or another thing to show that he was over into the Lord's day you believe that he went over into the Lord's day and saw the Lord as judge not his priest not his King not as but as judge he is a judge don't you believe that the Bible said he's the judge and here he was dressed as the judge showing that he had done what he was and what he was to The Sinner what he was to the Christian and here here stands now with the voice of many Waters and his countenance was like unto the sun shining in his strength what does the scripture say about many Waters the voice of many Waters people right so we set on judgment with him not in front of it to be judged right we set on the Judgment seat with him John saw all the way there in Revelations 1 over to the Judgment seat how many times do we give you this one why are we not a denomination 1958 927 and if you'll notice Revelations 1 number 13 on your notes we find Jesus standing in the seven Church ages the seven golden Candlestick when he turned and saw one like the son of man standing clothed with a how was it it was a bride standing in the candlesticks draw out right right right damn it so what did John see on the patmas look down at the next one there seven Church ages 1954 512 we've read this one before right number 13 a the reason I add these A's and B's is because you know I'm not so good and other this so I have to put in some quotes every once in a while kind slide them in and hand them to Joe so when I do I give them a and b and c and d you know all that all right all right what paragraph 204 what the spirit said the candlesticks all right in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like the son of man what one like him who was this his bride one like him watch How It Was clothed with a garment down to the foot the Holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed us from our sins with his own blood G about the pouch not a man a woman amen and a golden girdle the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ right going down he swore by himself 195422 Revelation 1 Jesus was seen or the church rather of the bride of Christ seen him standing into seven golden candlesticks and his feet was made of brce which Bryce is divine Judgment of the church out upon the world the Divine judgment so what do we need now do we need any more to be able to see now we're down to the 14 that we come to what he does not say he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but he knew who that was I mean we could be in a great big crowd and I could walk up and I say Danny he know cuz he knows my voice I can't disguise my voice on the telephone I call people try to I can't do it they I Brother D but see now watch it does John does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but he turned to see the voice right and watch him cuz he was a prophet he knew he was going to be there and he knew things was going on I like that he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one in the same Jesus is the word then who are we you get to really see in the word you see in Jesus now watching go on down while we're at it and then we'll go back and read the scripture same message page 110 7even Church a excuse me seven Church ages 54512 he was standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks who is it what is this re this revelation of Jesus Christ and here he's not a prop Propet here he is the almighty God manifested the Alpha and Omega cuz that's who he said he was that's right but the catch of it is is where's he at he's showing himself in his prde amen like I've told you show me in the Book of Revelations anywhere that Jesus has ever shown by himself he shown any is right let's just go ahead and read this patas Vision number 16 60 1204 he comes down G about the PS and the things the sful glory of his person the sound of many Waters look what he says and he gets to what a vision what did he see here the glorified Son of God oh no that's son of man ni it's bride but the glorify Son of God glorified Son of God and the bride glorifies him amen so now let's read the scripture down through where we talking about and I turned to see The Voice verse 12 that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden Candlestick in the midst of the seven candle sticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the pouch with a golden G his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire that's Daniel 7 cuz it comes to the anent of days the white Throne judgment eyes were Fame of fire feet like UND defined Bry as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth one a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead now look at John and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not now who's that the angel no brother R said it's not a angel it's not a prophet he said it was God come on fear not red letter right I am the first in the last a ain't no Prophet can say that keep that in mind ain't no Prophet can say I'm the first in the LI it'll help you understand the reading of the Bible I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more and have the keys of hell and death write the things which thou Hast seen and the things which are that's and the things which shall be here after then he explains the mystery of the church ages and you know the the candlesticks and things but what I want you to see now is this then Revelations 2 is the church edges Revelations 3 is the church edges right do you have a Scofield bible it's all red letter right that was Jesus writing himself that was Jesus revealing himself that was the Alpha and Omega making himself known where's the angel come on why does not John say he told me to do this no brother random says I think I got it in here from forgive me for just jumping around because I want to make sure you get it patmas Vision 1960 number 20 on your notes 1204 now just a little comment before we go before we read again this morning we taken the Supreme deity of the revelation of Jesus Christ who God revealed to him who God revealed him to us this morning as the Supreme deity the Great I am not I was or will be I am always and we notice in this first chapter of Revelation or the Revelation what is the revelation of Jesus Christ what's the first thing he reveals himself here as the god of Heaven not a tri God but one God one God and he re reveals himself that way in the first of the Revelation and speaks it four times in the first chapter so that there will be no mistake the first thing you got to know that he is not a prophet he is not a Je your God he is not a secondary God he is God he is God and so therefore the Revelation come came forth and we will we still continue with it tonight on down as we of the seven full Glory listen patas Vision 257 paragraph and I fell at his feet my the prophet couldn't stand no more see such a vision he just he just sapped his strength and he fell down and his feet is dead and he laid his hand on it oh my not a prophet God I am the first and the last I am the first of the Revelation the last of the Revelation I'm here him he that was I'm he that is and he that will come there's somewhere in there I missed one where that I wanted to bring it to you but just remember brother R says paragraph 997 patas Vision if you find it go ahead with it but if not brother BR said Jesus said I want you to know who I am before I tell you anything else I want you to know who I am he said before I tell you anything else the last quote there you'll see is off Christ The Mystery of God reveal where the brother Brown says it's the brightest part of the mystery amen now let me ask you one question I will not speak no more on this subject of what I'm fixing to say until a later date so no need of asking me why was it that John is called the greatest of all the prophets now I've got what brother R said on that so don't worry about it but John was called the greatest of all the prophets we emphasize a lot upon and I do too that it says but the least in the kingdom is greater than John and that's true cuz John was not a born again believer in the New Testament Kingdom but he was the angel of the Covenant John was the angel of the Covenant don't mind say it that way but I won't pray no more cuz you see we're going to come back to the same thing John do exactly right we are amen going to come come back Amen to be to the place you see Church all I'm trying to get you to see is one thing everyone said hold up a point let get it one thing I don't mind quitting one thing an angel can deliver a message a prophet can deliver a message but if Jesus Christ does not step forth and vindicate that to be true come on what good is it come on Amen now you take this for whatever you want and God forgive me for the carnality of Ed but there's no difference in John Smith in all of his plates that he had than what most people have about brother brandham and the Bible and the things that's right that's but you see brother brandom it took him 30 years to preach the statute of perfect man that's what he said and you know that was not even his message he was sent to bring right right not even his message he was s to bring that's right it was a restoration message see that's why that angel couldn't tell him no more that angel was sent to him that was with him all his life couldn't tell him no further than that who was it that come to John on patmas here we've shown that the angel is only deliverer but that the Lord Jesus stepped on the scene let go back and read the fourth verse fifth verse there where that that angel tells John this is the one who is and one who's to come which is and and all of that and Jesus immediately when he steps on the scene he said I'm exactly what John said I'm the one which is and which is to come there's no nobody in this world puts any more emphasis upon brother Bram in the correct order than I do but he's not among God and he can't reveal a thing to me right if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's why you don't know it that's right amen well I just can't understand why brother brand one of the biggest men of this message he said brother Brown made so many slips of the tongues on the message of uh Feast of the trumpets that you can't understand what he's saying you better go read that book CU brother or listen to tape cuz brother R said this is thus sayith the Lord that's right that shows our carnality that's why because we can't put together things cuz brother R said on on Feast of the trumpet that the seventh Church age messenger Meli 4 comes between the sixth and seventh trumpet and he says all trumpets is the isual and all trumpets sound under the six seal so so that would automatically look like it' put brother brandham over there but in the tribulation but it can't put him over there cuz if it did mean You' be over there you see because statements are made by a prophet and people try to carnally understand them that's right or calculate them it's just the same way of Daniel 70 weeks when they around come up and he said there's in the Daniel 70 weeks he said there's one week left after the Rapture and yet they went haywire in the seal books everywh else and brother R said no no no no no you didn't understand me never did I believe Jesus's Ministry they're talking one thing he's talking about something else that's right right we better get to Revelation that's right but my point tonight is one thing thing even though an angel a prophet could sit down in your home and explain the Bible to the detail right it would still take the Holy Spirit to reveal it amen cuz he's the only revealer of the word and if he's the only revealer of the word then he's the one I'm looking forward to you never noticed I give it to you the other day so you had never noticed that brother randam kept saying we're looking for a great one to come oh he was just throwing you off on that because he was that one oh where did he become it you see then that made a lot of people run along and they say I'm the great one he come to introduce me oh lord well they've all went by the grave so far you said well he did too yeah but he'll raise all them that holler I'm the great one they're not going to raise until the Judgment that's right and then they'll find out that's right but we're just chapter one chapter two chapter 4 John hears a voice was that the voice of the angel or was it the voice of the Lord I just ask simple questions well you confuse us no no no now he's already confused I didn't confuse you I'm sorry he was already confused brother random I was listening to him the other day on the tape and boy he was raking down on something on predestination he said now I'm not trying let's see if I can remember the exact wording I'm not trying to to condemn people or something he said I'm just preaching the gospel he said I'm just telling the truth about it so you can think that you're arguing fussing and screaming about something no I fa this Doctrine before I faced it and had to sit down and tell a person I didn't agree with I've been there before and seen these things the only emphasis I have is one thing that angel can't deliver nothing to you and I that Prophet can't deliver nothing to you and I he can deliver the word yes right it was already written right brother rown couldn't add anything to what was written right right but you see light had not shined on it that's right when the prophet preached his message it brought it to light but it still takes the Holy Spirit to reveal it if you don't have the Holy Spirit you're just as blind as you ever was am and can't understand yeah yet you say oh that's in Deep thing about stay away from there why the Holy Spirit WR right right amen yeah amen Jesus said I sent my angel and I told him what to tell you but he can't the angel can't reveal it right your Prophet said I am nothing but a trumpet he said a trumpet is totally mute unless someone blows it right he said one day I used to think that Jesus loved me and God hated me your Prophet said that he said I found out it St same person that's right so that's the point now come on that's the point I want you to see that no matter who brings what to you it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal it amen amen now let me put one more point to it and if the Holy Spirit reveals it the Holy Spirit can make it manifest right the prophet cannot make it manifest right now you show me where you can and I'll go back and tell you that he would stand there and say you you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on him I can't do a thing till he comes you might order read a little on those things because sometimes he's talking about the angel that walked with him and sometimes he's talking about Jesus Christ that's why it's so close you see we make angels to be angels and that's right they are Earthly Angels but if there's not a Heavenly Angel we've lost the whole story brother Dale can preach to you till he turns blue in the face but you can't see it until God reveals it to you and I know that that's why I don't mind going over it and over it and over it because I know and realize it you can't get it until God reveals it to you am I right does the scripture say that no man can call Jesus the Christ except It Be by let me quote your Prophet on that scripture he said unless it be by the Holy Ghost cuz you're just saying what somebody else said he said you can call call him Jesus Jesus and not getting nothing you know why cuz you're saying what somebody else says about Jesus well brother Dale you're just so dried and cut and everything else and these other brothers even they preach ER I just feel so good we get over on the other side it ain't going to be worried about that right it bothers me because that I can't preach like others I cry and I pray and I ask God to help me I can't be with Just What I Am I can't have be nothing but just what I am and that's the way I believe God I just believe what he says if I hold it up in this red letter I just believe Jesus spoke that that's how much I believe it but you know what I believe God spoke the whole thing it don't I've always told you it don't always be red letter all the way through because it's God talking to us whether he uses prophets Angels or who he using he's talking to us right right now let me say it this way an angel came to Mary and brought a message but he never put the seed in her wound right is that true right that's right he only told her what would take place right he said the Holy Ghost will overshadow you amen the disciples walking with the Lord Jesus that's right yep right he told him he said okay boys come on back in sit down up you in the upper room and keep your mouth shut cuz you'll mess it up I'll be back amen and even though they could deliver the message on the day of Pentecost even though Peter after receiving the Holy Ghost could bring the message y he could still couldn't put that Holy Ghost in them people's heart that's right amen if you don't get nothing nothing else that's all I want you to get all right that's right they worth it tonight for me amen for you to see one thing right it takes God to reveal amen that's right no matter who tells you it takes God to reveal right youve heard brother random talk about Moses now there's two or three different ways it's said in there now you put it together do what you want to one time he says that Moses sits on on his mother's knee two or three years old and said she says you're not the son of Charles and brandom other times he said somewhere 15 years old or something you know different something it comes and and Moses realizes it it's all right I said Charleson El say you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter right okay you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter you're a Jew but you know what he got ready yeah but all he got out of all that he could do and all that he believed about what he was he got brother R let me quote him a stinking dead Egyptian that's and that's what he went saying that's that's all M has got am out of all the years he said five minutes in front of the burning Bush was more than all the 40 Years of his mother Telly that's right he got something personal that's right you better pray for God to give you a revelation cuz that's the only way it's going to make it out of here that's the thing what we got brother 288 and red book 288 a red book anybody have a need I just pray that you'll take that home with you trome time believe it holy ghost is the most important thing that you could ever think of only the Holy Ghost can reveal the word Ang com morning or night will be all in the day shall in the where no anybody have a I believe that God is the one reveal the angel delivered it to John Jesus come on to see the angel steps aside and Jesus speaks himself straight to Jo will come you know him as Savior in the be happy forever to put them in their Jesus sisters ask for her children oh we believe you you'll give them you'll give them a good time on hon and things and this wding will be FR you be we thank you in Jesus nameus say yesterday today forever there no in the world to put the emphasis on Jesus like brother around none of the Riders none of them doing put the emph like he did he always waited on him our I you will be there will all the think about it want to reveal his word you see what we do a lot of times we read it and we think because that we read it or can even put it together in a who what when word high form that we've got it who want when word how is a presentation in other words you going to present something you got to get new where walk in and how see it it's got to be revealed you ever ask God to reveal to see when you don't understand what brother Dale is saying or any other preacher you know is preaching the truth do you ever pray that's right or you just get all upset go it well it's just intellectualism he just he just intellect he just he just always conjur everybody and just he just upset with everybody there's a blessed time that's I changed I'm trying to save your soul if I make you mad at me and get you enough to study the word maybe it'll work we shall see the king we shall see the king we shall see the king we shall moment AG go the prophet said when you see the word you see Jesus this was Jesus appearing in John many times he speaks of prophets Angel John was the greatest of all the prophets can we go ahead and say it the prophet salvations John sh the word flesh greater than all the prophets he the only Prophet that Jesus appeared

Bride of cross he said it John that this messenger would be pointing to the skies to a word born bride love to go folks love to go right take that last statement home with you could you see I know how people do that listening to tapes and I wasn't going to say that but most people that listen to tapes they cut it off quick as you get the people to come up to the altar they don't wait I mean you know they don't wait for the rest of the story that's all right so they don't care the rest of the story see God is trying to reveal himself amen do you and me but he's in you and me trying to reveal itself right he's not revealing the god off up you under somewhere you he's revealing himself right way father we love you we thank you we ask you to just go with us now and help us to understand
