TRANSCRIPT
========================================
their mamas all right we're talking about uh the high priest in uh hebrews chapter five and just kind of wanted to start on this slide it just kind of said in your mind um that christ is our high priest and he's the high priest of our confession and he's seated on the throne of our heart and you know you in the old testament the high priest would go into the um the holy of holies and on the day of atonement once a year and and do his work and you know but but now christ is fulfilling that role so let's just go to the lord in prayer before we get into this scripture and begin our little study lord we asked lord that you'll just bless our study this morning and bless all the ones that are uh like brother terence said that are traveling brother wade and brother louise lord as their minister in this this uh this morning we ask that you'll just be with us today lord god and help us lord as we come expecting to receive from you in the name of the lord jesus so hebrews chapter 5 verse 1 says for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men so paul is sitting in our mind he begins to set what what a high priest is and and how a high priest is called is called of god it's not somebody that that says well i i think that i would i would like to do this job it's somebody that god has ordained for that purpose and the high priest his job is to ordain for men and things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins and sometimes it's a little bit easier to read another translation so i've got another translate the berean study bible um some somebody was asking me recently is it okay to read other translations and i i say if if it'll help you you sometimes the king james version has um you know we don't we don't really think in the way that they that it's it's written sometimes so it helps to kind of pull up another another version a little bit and and compare them course you know you got to be careful but um anything that'll help i'm in favor of um so the berean study bible says every high priest is appointed from among men to represent them in matters relating to god to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins and the king james version goes on and says who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity so in other words uh we've got a high priest that look so in the old testament the high priest was was somebody like them that that had his own weaknesses and had his own struggles and things but now jesus is a high priest that has no sin but yet he went through he was tempted like we are and he he uh you know uh like in the prince of the house of david the author there said that he had a headache there at the tomb of lazarus and and uh and and so he he know he understands what we're going through whether you're no matter where you are in life if you're a young child he was a child so he knows the struggles of a child if you're a teenager he understands the struggles of a teenager and knows the the you know uh how how maybe adults uh seem to misunderstand you sometimes and all of those kind of things and what a blessing it is to when when we go to prayer we have somebody that we can reach out to that knows what what's what's happening what we're dealing with and so it says by reason hereof he all does for the people so also for himself to offer sins and and paul goes on to say and no man taketh this honor unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron so now jesus of course you know uh he he all through his ministry he would he would uh he would kind of go back to you know i didn't i'm not i'm not putting myself into this situation i'm not i'm not saying these things of myself but actually actually god the bearing witness of me and anybody that's called of god they don't they don't put themselves into that role you go back to exodus 28 it says when when god actually called heir into the role of the high priest and he said take thou unto the air and thy brother now look aaron aaron it wasn't because aaron uh was a particularly great person or anything like that or but god god chose him to to fulfill the role of the high priest and all of his sons so he called them and so we just want to dwell on what a calling is for a few minutes that he may minister unto me and the priest's office even arab nadav and abihu eleazar and ithamar air and sons and thou shall make holy garments for her and thy brother for glory and for beauty and thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted whom i have filled with the spirit of wisdom that they may make aaron's garments to consecrate him that he may minister unto me in the priest's office so aaron was set aside to fulfill that role that god a calling of god is something where god is god is god it's a supernatural thing where god is moving on the scene to draw somebody into a place that he wants them to be in now you say oh well it's a minister you're talking about i'm talking about i'm talking about anybody if he's drawing you maybe this born and speaking to your heart is god calling you to be a christian god drawing you into the spot that he wants you to be in and so he we're we're hewn like at like those um those blocks that went into the the temple that that solomon built god draws us and then he hews us out and puts us right where he wants us to go so you know when you're when you're born again maybe he'll begin to speak to your heart and say well i i want you to preach the gospel and you begin to feel like maybe there's maybe there's something a call in my life and he's drawing you it's god drawing you and pulling you not yourself drawing you to put you into a place so and the maybe maybe the one the greatest example of a call of god is in isaiah where isaiah you know he'd been looking at uriah and looking at men and then what other people are doing and finally god got him to a place where he pulled him off to the side and and showed him that showed him what his real influence should be his brother brown priest in that sermon influence and the seraphim took a coal of fire off of the altar and he laid upon his mouth and said lo this had touched thy lips and that iniquity is taken away and that sin purged also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i see and who will go for us so so god's wanting somebody that there's when god calls you there's got to be you got to respond and when he calls you it's not he's not forcing you he's not going to force you to be a christian he's not going to force you to be a preacher he's not going to force you to be a deacon whatever that is but he he wanted isaiah to say i'll go i'll do it whom shall i sin and who will go for us then said i hear am i send me so jesus was called he was he was called because it was god moving in him to be our high priest and to fulfill you know how could how could anybody of themselves go up on the cross and die and do all of those things but yet god it was got the life of god in him down veiled within that flesh to go to go minister for us and to perform the the the deeds of a high priest and to be to be our high priest to to live the life and to preach the gospel and all those all those things but let's just meditate for a few moments on on what some other great preachers have said about being called now i i i love some of these quotes that as i was kind of doing some research david livingston said if a commissioned by an earthly king is considered an honor how can a commission by heavenly king be considered a sacrifice and robert dabney said the true doctrine of calling is that the man whom god has designed and qualified to preach learns his call through the word now that's a powerful quote right there let's let's sit on that for a second now because you know that goes for a christian too now you know you you when you're called of god and you you you start coming to church and along and along you you begin to maybe wonder if you're born again and what's going on and but you you begin to get surety from the word the word is where actually you you began over time it as it begins to open up to you you begin to identify yourself and your life and what god has done with you by the word so maybe somebody would say well how do how do i know if i'm called to preach how do i know if i'm called that you you look into the word and the word is what identifies your calling the true doctrine of calling is that the man whom god has designed and qualified to preach learns his call through the word the word is the instrument by which the spirit teaches him with prayer that he is to preach the word is the thing that that identifies your calling maybe that's kind of a it's a really profound thing but i've found that to be true when you when you get into a rough spot and you're wondering what what's what's happening in your life you go back to the word and the word is what proves things out right when you can begin to look in your life and see that your life lines up with with with uh your life parallels the stories that you're reading in the bible of david and all these all these great men and you can see your life played out in the story of rahab then you begin to get confidence that your life is going in the right path that you're walking in the light of god's word martin lord jane said jones martin lloyd jones said it was mr spurgeon i believe who used to say to young men if you can do anything else do it if you can do anything else do it because if you're doing it of your own self to be popular or for fame or for money or to to to be a great person you're doing it for the wrong thing if you can stay out of the ministry stay out of the ministry i would certainly say that without any hesitation whatsoever i would say that the only man who is called to preach is the man who cannot do anything else in the sense that he is not satisfied with anything else this call to preach is so put upon him and such pressure comes to bear upon him that he says i can do nothing else i must preach it doesn't that compare with what isaiah was saying that what are you because what are you doing you're preaching because because you want to help somebody you want to help somebody get out of there out of their uh their eggshell say it like that and that's how that's so any calling is when you're called of god to be a christian there's something motivating you that you can't you can't not you it's it's pulling you to to get out of the world to get out of your your the way that you think to uh you get to a place of desperation where you've you've got to move on with god martin lord jones said i have always felt when someone has come to me and told me that he has been called to be a preacher that my main business is to put every conceivable obstacle that i can think of in his way isn't that a strange thing because you don't want somebody that's trying to promote their self or their own idea and you know uh being preacher being a preacher is uh well i think i think one of these other quotes references that so i'll just hold on for a second and john newton said none but he who made the world can make a minister of the gospel if the young man has capacity culture and application it may make him a scholar a philosopher or an orator but a true minister must have certain principles motives feelings and aims which no industry or endeavors of men can either acquire or communicate they must be given from above where they cannot be received now see how see why jesus was called of god he was called because god was god actually walking in him and doing he he was god manifested in the flesh and the things that he did and the words that he spoke that you know the people that listen to him said no man i've never heard a man's talk like this before because it was god's using his mouth and using his uh it was he was god manifested in the flesh manifested for us and jc philpott said those whom god calls for the work he usually yeah here's the quote i wanted to get to those whom god calls to the work he usually so strips and empties so pulls down humbles and a basis so shows them what the ministry is and their own unfitness for it that they shrink back from so arduous and important to work and can scarcely be persuaded that they are called to it you know there's there's a pattern in there that it when god forgot to really put a stone where it needs to go first it's got to be it's got to be uh it has to go through some low points now you think about the life of christ when when he was rejected and that they rejected his word and and and struck his back and put him on the cross when they rejected his message that actually put him where he was supposed to be on the cross to fulfill his word now even today when the word was rejected when brother brown preached i indict this generation for rejecting the word that then that place that actually moved the word to where it was supposed to be it placed it so even in your own life for the word actually be put into effect really the way it's supposed to be in your life you've got to come to a really low place where you realize that even in your own self there's nothing there's nothing that you can do you have to rely completely on god so many times god will take you down to and maybe this is not just i'm not just talking about ministers but just everybody that but but also especially ministers that to really to really be effectual he'll bring you down to a low place where you think you you think all sorts of things he strip so strips and empty so pulls down humbles and a basis so shows them what the ministry is in their own unfitness for it that they shrink back from so arduous and important to work and can scarcely be persuaded that they are called to it we need hardly remark how different this is from the forward pushing bold if not presuming spirit which so many manifest in their ambitious aim almost to force their way into the pulpit so god wants somebody that can't do it they can't do it of their own self to preach the gospel j.c riles said i felt shut up to do it and saw no other course of life open to me i couldn't help to do it i couldn't help but do it and c.a spurgeon charles spurgeon said he that can toy with his ministry encountered to be like a trade or like any other profession was never called of god but he that has a charge pressing on his heart and a woe ringing in his ear and preaches as though he heard the cry excuse me the cry of hell behind him and saw his god looking down on him oh wow that man entreats the lord that is here is made out here in vain whatever call a man may pretend to have if he has not been called a holiness he certainly has not been called to the ministry i think that's another thing that maybe maybe sometimes ministers forget about is that brother brown preached in the message influence that if you're called to preach the gospel you're called to a life of holiness so that you can have an influence with the people because you know there's so many that have fallen by the wayside because they got caught up in things and and we're not living a life that you know if paul if paul could say that that if it's going to offend somebody to eat meat i'm not going to do it then how much bolder we should be to to to to try to have an influence where we we stay away from things that will will cause people to stumble because the calling of god is something to be something it's it's an honorable thing and that's why paul said and no man take this honor unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron so also christ glorified not himself to be made in high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son today have i begotten thee so in john chapter eight jesus answered if i honor myself and it's not true of any if any man any any preacher sometimes you know we we maybe we get we get a little bit sidetracked sometimes and start thinking that that uh our goal is to have people follow us or look at us but our goal is to point back at jesus christ our goal is to point at him and so it doesn't matter how popular you are or how unpopular you are or how many people uh look at you strange while you're preaching or don't look at you strange or getting it or not getting it what matters is that we're preaching the gospel so he said if i honor myself my honor jesus our example now my honor is nothing it is my father that honoreth me of whom you say that he is your god yet you have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his say and again in john chapter 7 and jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me see how see how he is our example because this is how we we preach that this is not this is not even the doctrine of william branham that this is the doctrine of the father that we're preaching this is not my doctrine but when we preach the words off of the page and to make it a living reality you this is it's his that sin us if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is is in him you see how you see why god will take a minister and and mold them down into where they they they're just nothing until they can't they can't do it of themselves because they're not that to a place where they're not looking for for praise or glory or anything because he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him and jesus said in john chapter 8 and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth that's what paul was talking about here and when he says and no man taketh this honor unto himself jesus came on the scene as our example an example of as our high priest to take somebody that we can have confidence in that he was he was everything that that we can rely on in john chapter 5 31 he said if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true there's another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true he sent unto john and he bear witness under the truth see he had a forerunner a forerunner to forerun the coming of the son of man but he said but i receive not testimony from man so he's not looking for somebody to give him praise and and and to give him pass on the back and tell him whether or not his sermon was good he said but these things i say that you might be saved he was a burning and a shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his life but i have greater witness than that of john you see what he's saying he said now i've got a man to testify of mia that my that of who i am to that proclaim but but now i'm not relying on that so much i've got a greater witness than that of john and that greater witness like like how paul said we've got a greater uh uh uh uh well i'm i'm drawing a blanket of the scripture a greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father has sent me when he was doing the will of the father the works of the father and god's life was made manifest in him so that the people could see that the eyes of the blind were open and and the lame walked and people heard the word and they he he broke the loaves and the fishes and god's life was manifested in him i've got a greater witness than that of john so he was our high priest and the old testament the primary purpose of the high priest was to serve as a representative and mediator as a representative and a mediator between the people in yahweh it was the high priest's responsibility to see that the covenant was enforced now set this in your mind that don't maybe look so much at think about jesus walking on the shores of galilee but he's our high priest now seated in our heart to do what to see that the covenant is enforced so he's in your heart actually living it out he's when you do wrong he's he's there to say you shouldn't have talked to that person that right that way you need to you need to repent he's there to open up the word to you because he's your he's our high priest as the representative for the nation of israel the high priest had a tremendous responsibility to direct the hearts to change your heart toward god and the fulfillment of the covenant so he's the high priest seated in our heart now like in the old testament how the high priest would go through that outer core inner court holy of holies well now our high priest has done those doing that work to go into our into our heart to change our hearts to see that the covenant is enforced and to be a representative a mediator between god and man throughout the old testament there is a foreshadowing and forward reaching hope of a more perfect high priesthood that can represent god effectively and be a sufficient mediator for the people of israel the cyclical pattern of the lives of good and poor high priest makes it clear that no human being can fully perform his responsibility so paul goes on to say as he saith also in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard and that he feared he's a priest now paul doesn't really get into melchizedek until hebrews chapter 7 but we're kind of leading up to that so he's saying he's trying to set in our minds that that they had a high priest after the order of aaron a man that could die and would go in and out of the holy of holies and every year he had to go go in and out but now we're changing over to a priest after the order of melchizedek a a a a priesthood where once into the holy of holies is fine it it finishes the work and this as melchizedek came in the flesh and was manifest to minister to abraham and talk to abraham in the flesh so jesus god was manifested in the flesh of jesus and in the days of his flesh as paul was saying when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears again what's he talking about he's talking about a man that got crushed there in the garden of gethsemane a man that that that i got the little picture there crying out to god father let this cup pass for me so who said and start setting in our mind who is this melchizedek who was that melchizedek when we i just got a little picture to show that melchizedek laying his hands on abraham and blessing him and as bro you know we were just listening to brother branham explaining in that sermon before i before the lesson that melchizedek was god in flesh that god pulled up around that theophany pulled up around all that the pot ash and the petroleum and all that and walked out there and had communion with abraham and sat there and talked with him and identified that he was god by by saying uh where's sarah and tell him what she was thinking and and and and discerning things and telling abraham got up and walked with him and looked over at sodom and gomorrah when he when he came and visited him later and showed him the things that were going to happen but we'll get to that a little bit more when we get to hebrews chapter 7. hebrews chapter 5 where we are he says paul says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and all them that obey him called of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek though he were a son yet learned the obedience now you think how how could jesus learn to think of a little baby a little baby can't preach but as a little baby keeps eating after a while it can start babbling and after a while that little baby that that's babbling after a while it can it can learn to follow some direction and get out of the road and gets a little popping from his mama when it runs in the road and it keeps on growing so he learned by obedience by the things which he suffered he got a little popping from his mama if he maybe uh played in the road or did something like that but i think one of the examples i like to use there's there's this thing that psychologists like to do with young people with little kids and that's the the picture i have as we're just closing up right here uh that they'll ask a little kid if i a little child if i put water in this in this tall glass and then pour it into this little short squat glass is the same amount of water and a child cannot tell you that it's the same amount of water because they don't have that capacity yet they're not yet at that place to to be able to say it's the same amount of water but but you you do that to a teenager as the musicians come forward a teenager will say that's the same amount of water the older you get the more capacity you have and the older that jesus got in the flesh the more capacity he had to receive revelation from the father and the more the older he got the more he learned and he learned obedience by the things which he suffered the things he went through as god put him into the place that he wanted wanted him to be in and we'll just stop right there as we continue on god bless you saints [Applause]
