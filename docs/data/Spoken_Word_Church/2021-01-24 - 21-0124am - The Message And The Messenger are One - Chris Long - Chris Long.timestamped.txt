[0:15] my
[0:16] [Music]
[0:31] [Applause]
[0:31] [Music]
[0:41] pour out your power
[0:45] [Music]
[0:52] i am
[0:58] [Music]
[1:10] lord
[1:13] [Music]
[1:22] you are holy
[1:26] [Music]
[1:39] amen we can see him this morning
[1:42] if we'll just open our spiritual eyes
[1:45] to his word you know a lot of folks
[1:49] i believe in the day that we live in
[1:52] that portray or call themselves
[1:54] christians don't really know what a
[1:55] christian is
[1:57] because they don't really know who
[1:59] christ is
[2:01] christ is the anointed word
[2:04] jesus himself when he was here was the
[2:06] word made flesh
[2:08] and that's where a lot of people
[2:10] misunderstand the lord
[2:13] sending himself in the form of his son
[2:16] is that he was vindicating his own word
[2:18] exactly
[2:19] which is what he's asking us to do today
[2:23] amen as fellow heirs
[2:26] sons and daughters of god god bless you
[2:29] it's a privilege as always to be in the
[2:31] house of the lord with you and to be
[2:32] here to minister and fellowship with you
[2:35] i do not have to introduce myself you
[2:37] all should know me by now
[2:39] i'll pray for the brother that's going
[2:40] to get eye surgery because i got eye
[2:42] surgery
[2:44] i did in december the 18th and they put
[2:46] a third eye
[2:48] right there on my forehead when they
[2:49] were taking out the stitches
[2:52] so you just pray for me that god will
[2:55] let that heal up and it's
[2:56] in its due time uh the rest of
[2:59] my eyes are doing well i can see so much
[3:02] better that now i don't have to use
[3:05] the 2.0 cheater glasses now i'm down to
[3:08] 1.5
[3:10] amen i brought him with me just in case
[3:13] so while you're standing if you would i
[3:16] gave brother
[3:16] wade he come in the office and said give
[3:18] me a title and i said
[3:20] good luck matter of fact i thought of
[3:24] five or six of them after you left
[3:27] i've been preaching at home on the third
[3:29] pool now i haven't been
[3:30] approaching it the way that i would have
[3:33] years ago
[3:34] i've been taking a different approach to
[3:36] it because the lord had spoke to me and
[3:38] said
[3:39] break it down so it doesn't seem
[3:41] mysterious
[3:42] doesn't seem something that's not
[3:44] attainable
[3:46] uh and and and the phrases that we use
[3:48] today
[3:49] uh quoting out of the message a lot of
[3:52] people are like oh
[3:55] no we can't handle that we just brother
[3:57] wade and i were talking no we don't
[3:59] preach on the seven seals well i do
[4:01] as brother samuel pointed out to me if
[4:03] the prophet
[4:05] spoke it it was for a reason
[4:08] but a lot of people are missing the
[4:10] reasons why he said it so that's what i
[4:12] want to preach on this morning
[4:14] i did give the message a title
[4:17] brother wade give me the title the end
[4:19] time message and i liked it so much i
[4:21] said the message
[4:22] the message and the messenger are one do
[4:26] you believe that
[4:28] then if you believe the message you are
[4:31] in fact a messenger
[4:34] so you must become one with it so
[4:37] let's take saint luke chapter 14 if you
[4:40] would
[4:41] this morning uh it says
[4:44] there uh at verse 16 when you get it
[4:47] parable
[4:48] this is in the scofield bible above the
[4:50] 16th
[4:51] verse it says the parable of the great
[4:54] supper all right
[4:57] so let's just see how this works
[5:02] verse 16 says then said he unto him
[5:06] a certain man made a great supper and
[5:10] bade many let's pray
[5:13] father we thank you lord for this
[5:16] portion of scripture that we're going to
[5:18] read this morning lord
[5:20] for the sake of time father we'll just
[5:22] start right here we're asking lord that
[5:25] you'd come down
[5:26] father and remove each one of us out of
[5:28] our places lord
[5:30] and let the holy spirit become the
[5:32] filter
[5:33] that's in us father that we can receive
[5:36] exactly
[5:37] the way that you ordained it to be
[5:39] received lord
[5:41] it's a parable to many father but you
[5:44] told the disciples when they asked about
[5:46] speaking in parables
[5:47] that it would be revealed to them
[5:50] because they were chosen and elected
[5:52] father
[5:53] they were ordained and they were
[5:55] predestinated and they were
[5:57] foreseen by you lord and i believe
[6:00] that's why we're here this morning
[6:03] bless us and help us father move me out
[6:05] of the way
[6:07] for your honor and your glory in jesus
[6:09] christ's name we ask it
[6:11] amen god bless you may be seated
[6:16] i hope this is going to be all right for
[6:18] you this morning but i'm going to charge
[6:19] right into it
[6:21] because i i preach at home in this in
[6:23] you know in a series a pastor can do
[6:25] that he can
[6:26] he can take a subject and he can go for
[6:29] for for days or weeks or months on it
[6:31] and
[6:32] and he doesn't have to give it but one
[6:33] title and he says part one and part two
[6:35] and part three and apartment he just
[6:37] keeps on parting it out right
[6:40] so i i i felt compelled as i was
[6:43] uh uh uh preaching on on the pool and
[6:46] i've given different
[6:48] uh segmented titles to it but
[6:51] um we know that that in the bible for as
[6:54] an example
[6:55] um to help you kind of get to where my
[6:59] thoughts are
[6:59] and for example for an example moses
[7:03] the great prophet moses had uh uh
[7:06] three pools now when we go into the
[7:09] scripture and we begin to look
[7:11] at moses's pulls we we begin to realize
[7:15] that
[7:15] if you will read your bible that he had
[7:18] the
[7:19] uh the the the the staff
[7:23] and he threw it down right and it turned
[7:25] into a serpent and then
[7:26] he and now moses didn't like snakes you
[7:29] could tell by reading in the bible he
[7:31] ran from it
[7:33] and then then of course the lord
[7:35] instructed him don't worry about it
[7:37] uh i'm going to give you what it takes
[7:39] to overcome being afraid of that serpent
[7:42] so he picks it up and we know it turns
[7:44] back into his staff
[7:46] and then and then the second pool was
[7:48] him taking his hand and putting it in
[7:50] his bosom and
[7:51] and then in a clean hand put it in pull
[7:54] it out it's got
[7:55] leprosy on it and put it back in and
[7:57] then it it's fine again
[7:59] now we can follow that those pools
[8:02] through
[8:03] uh the the life and and the ministry of
[8:07] our own profit
[8:09] we understand that um but then
[8:12] there that came down to this this
[8:15] phrase uh the third pull
[8:18] or the third segment or the or the third
[8:21] part
[8:22] uh of the ministry and of course um
[8:26] if you'll go back in the exodus for the
[8:29] sake of time i'm not going to go there
[8:30] but you'll find out that
[8:32] moses had a third poll but he never used
[8:34] it
[8:36] you can read that in your bible all
[8:38] right he never had to use it
[8:41] it was and there was a reason for it i i
[8:44] believe that when god put something in
[8:46] his word
[8:47] now it has a use and he's going to use
[8:50] it
[8:51] but what happens is as we begin to focus
[8:54] on
[8:54] the messenger that god would send
[8:58] and we lose track of the message because
[9:01] of the signs wonders and miracles or the
[9:04] pulls
[9:05] of that messenger's ministry
[9:08] they become so spectacular because of
[9:10] course it's not the man
[9:13] and truthfully i want to be very
[9:15] truthful with you on the way that i
[9:17] god has dealt with me i have come to the
[9:19] conclusion that this is not the message
[9:22] of william mary and branham
[9:24] no more than in exodus it was the
[9:27] message of moses
[9:30] it was god using the man
[9:33] and then the men to be
[9:36] able to uh convey himself
[9:40] through them right now i know you
[9:43] understand that i know i'm
[9:44] preaching to the choir this morning so
[9:46] y'all stand up and sing for me
[9:50] amen will do amen all right
[9:53] yeah man you know what brother branham
[9:55] said amen was that was like telling the
[9:57] dog to sick him
[9:59] amen and i'm very comfortable here
[10:02] behind brother
[10:03] samuel's pulpit and i appreciate his
[10:05] confidence in me to allow me to come and
[10:08] my friendship and love for for for
[10:10] brother wade and
[10:12] and sister june and and uh we're just we
[10:15] really enjoy
[10:15] ourselves so i want you to relax but i
[10:19] don't want you to fall asleep
[10:22] amen i want you i want you to have your
[10:25] hearts open
[10:26] because what i'm going to bring to you
[10:28] is not mysterious but
[10:30] but uh it's it's months worth of
[10:33] of of of work uh in just
[10:37] an hour or two you'd be real proud of me
[10:39] brother samuel last
[10:40] sunday or two sundays ago i think was
[10:43] last sunday i preached two hours now i
[10:44] hardly ever ever
[10:46] do that usually i'm 45 minutes to an
[10:49] hour and i can see the
[10:50] folks back here going what is it today
[10:56] well let me start out like this now i i
[10:59] want to go through
[11:01] some of the scriptures and i chose
[11:04] saint luke 14 and then matthew 22
[11:08] you see in saint luke 14 it's called the
[11:11] parable of the great
[11:12] supper so let's roll down a little ways
[11:16] into it before i get to the
[11:18] the to the definition of pull
[11:22] okay uh all right well you don't have to
[11:25] hold your bible anymore because you can
[11:26] look at the screen but i'll use mine
[11:29] because i got footnotes i have comments
[11:32] i got highlights are you ready
[11:36] so then said he unto him a certain man
[11:38] made a great supper
[11:40] and bade many and sent
[11:43] his servant at suppertime to say to them
[11:48] that were bitten come for all
[11:51] things are now ready
[11:54] and they all with one consent
[11:57] began to make excuse the first
[12:01] said unto him i bought a piece of ground
[12:03] and i must needs go and see
[12:05] it now i want to stop right there for a
[12:08] minute and i want to i want you to get
[12:10] that gist of of of how this is going to
[12:12] work now think about this
[12:15] here is a person who has been invited
[12:19] uh the word bidden has has many
[12:21] different
[12:22] uh uh meanings to it but here's one
[12:26] where
[12:27] where the the the the bible uses it is
[12:30] bad and bidden
[12:31] it's an invitation all right it's a
[12:34] request it's an
[12:36] offer it also can be a little bit more
[12:39] intense
[12:40] in that it also can become a beseechment
[12:44] or an entreatment that's a little more
[12:47] intense than an
[12:48] offer you know an offer is when you get
[12:51] something in the
[12:52] mail and they're asking you to become a
[12:54] a player
[12:56] or a partaker of of what the the the
[13:00] invitation that they sent you but when
[13:02] the salesman that works for that company
[13:05] shows up at the front door it gets a
[13:06] little more intense
[13:08] you see what i'm saying so there was an
[13:11] offer made a request
[13:13] uh uh uh it seemed almost casual
[13:16] but the importance of the invent
[13:20] of the event is what should make it more
[13:24] uh uh you know a decision has to be made
[13:28] when you get an invitation to go down to
[13:32] hear a sales pitch if you're not
[13:34] interested in the product or you don't
[13:36] want to well that's
[13:37] one thing but here is a an invitation
[13:41] uh by by somebody of of high priority
[13:45] now now i i want you to notice something
[13:48] it doesn't
[13:49] it doesn't really identify
[13:53] and break down who this man is it just
[13:56] says a certain man
[13:58] right now if you didn't know who this
[14:02] man
[14:02] was you might throw the invitation in
[14:05] the trash
[14:06] but if you had some prior uh
[14:10] knowledge of who this certain man was
[14:13] you might
[14:13] think oh this is an up important man in
[14:16] our community or
[14:17] or this is an important man down where i
[14:19] bank at or
[14:20] this is important man where i work you
[14:23] see it gets a little more personal
[14:26] but right here it seems very impersonal
[14:29] just a certain
[14:30] man all right so that means that
[14:34] maybe he wasn't as well known
[14:38] as he could have been maybe he just
[14:42] arrived in the community
[14:44] and he wanted to invite everybody in the
[14:47] community over to his
[14:49] house so that he could get to know them
[14:52] and they could get to know him now
[14:55] there's a reason why i'm taking the long
[14:57] way around
[14:58] right now is that because you need to
[15:00] see
[15:01] this in order for you to get
[15:04] one with the message
[15:08] it's easy to come to a relationship
[15:12] or understanding with the messenger
[15:15] but what he's conveying has a lot to do
[15:18] with the fancy t-shirt
[15:20] that brother samuel had on yesterday
[15:24] you see he'll wear it one of these days
[15:26] and you'll get to read what was on it
[15:28] but i'll quote the man that everybody uh
[15:31] uh i say it like this because it's very
[15:33] similar to a quote that the
[15:35] that the actor john wayne made one of
[15:38] the many things that he made famous he
[15:40] said
[15:41] i can't help it if you don't understand
[15:44] what i said
[15:46] [Laughter]
[15:48] all right and and and god says things
[15:53] through a a message that he conveys
[15:56] through a messenger
[15:58] but the understanding also has to be
[16:01] sent
[16:01] down by god in order for you to come to
[16:06] an
[16:06] understanding of what's being said now
[16:09] we know that's
[16:10] that's the message of matthew 16 where
[16:13] where he asks who do men say i the son
[16:16] of man
[16:16] am and there was lots of answers and i
[16:19] if you really understand god's word none
[16:22] of those answers were exactly wrong
[16:26] [Laughter]
[16:27] because each messenger and each
[16:30] prophet that god would send
[16:34] was essential an essential part
[16:38] of the whole but he wanted to know if
[16:41] peter knew the whole
[16:43] who do men say i the son of man am well
[16:45] some say you're prophet some say this
[16:47] and some say
[16:48] that some say you're a good man some say
[16:49] you're a bad man and some say you're a
[16:51] crazy man and
[16:52] some say you're a good preacher and some
[16:54] down and down and down and down
[16:56] and he said that's all fine and dandy
[17:00] but i want to know who you personally
[17:03] peter i want to know who you personally
[17:08] think i am and he didn't have to think
[17:12] he said thou art the christ the son of
[17:14] the living god
[17:16] and we understand that peter was blessed
[17:18] by that statement
[17:20] but then what jesus said after that
[17:23] it became controversial you understand
[17:27] he said because upon this rock
[17:29] well there's there's there's a faction
[17:32] of
[17:32] of of of christianity that believes that
[17:35] the church was going to be built on
[17:36] peter
[17:37] now that started with the roman catholic
[17:39] church
[17:40] they made peter the first pope which is
[17:42] really interesting because peter was
[17:44] married
[17:46] and we and we and we have no record
[17:49] historically or any kind in the
[17:51] scripture that peter ever made it to
[17:52] even rome
[17:54] but they put him there they removed his
[17:57] wife
[17:58] and made him a pope because of the
[18:00] statement that peter made
[18:03] but then the protestant or protestant
[18:06] churches
[18:08] that that that that broke away from the
[18:10] roman catholic church
[18:12] and and the fact that they they believed
[18:14] that the foundation of the church was
[18:16] built on peter
[18:17] said no no that's not what he meant
[18:22] see how now now now dissension
[18:25] has started now now confusion has begun
[18:29] why because now you've got two sides
[18:31] and and they begin to argue and and
[18:34] disagree
[18:35] and split up and split apart about where
[18:38] the church
[18:39] who's who's it built on because the
[18:41] protestants believe no no no
[18:43] he he's it's built on him jesus the
[18:46] christ
[18:47] you see and both sides are wrong
[18:50] amen did you know that right it's not
[18:53] built upon peter
[18:54] and it's not built upon christ the
[18:56] reason we know that is they threw
[18:58] christ out he was the funny-looking
[19:01] stone
[19:03] that was the head of the corner and they
[19:06] didn't use him so they didn't build the
[19:08] church on him
[19:10] but the church is built on the
[19:12] revelation that god
[19:14] gives you of who
[19:17] he is so therefore we're relying on god
[19:22] this morning
[19:24] i can't rely on myself if i was to rely
[19:27] on myself i might have another stone
[19:29] that
[19:29] the church was built on maybe if i was a
[19:32] certain kind of a man i would think it
[19:34] was built on me
[19:36] but i don't think that way god has given
[19:38] me
[19:39] uh i would use the word punishment but i
[19:42] don't believe that's really the way it
[19:43] should be taken
[19:44] i believe god has given me lots of tests
[19:47] we know in the bible it says that god
[19:49] tempted job but the prophet of god said
[19:52] that's not exactly the way it works he
[19:54] didn't tempt job
[19:55] he tested him well you're looking at a
[19:58] man who's been tested
[20:00] all his life now i have failed a lot of
[20:03] those tests
[20:04] but my failures
[20:08] have worked to the good because i
[20:12] believe
[20:12] his word i believe he's in control
[20:15] i believe he he he's the master of
[20:18] everything
[20:19] the world's in chaos right now are
[20:21] countries in chaos right now
[20:23] god stealing control
[20:26] you say well why is it such a mess it's
[20:30] such a mess because
[20:31] god decided that man asked if he could
[20:34] have control of it and god said i'll
[20:35] give you control of it
[20:37] it ain't gonna work out god already
[20:40] warned him
[20:40] i'm telling you this isn't gonna work
[20:43] but if you
[20:44] want it i'll let you have it
[20:48] for a time and boy
[20:52] what a mess we have made so brothers and
[20:56] sisters i'll look at myself
[20:58] i'll cut the country out right now look
[20:59] at myself and say if i was decided that
[21:02] i was going to take over i'd be a mess
[21:06] so let go and let god
[21:10] that's the key amen
[21:13] so here we have a uh a a parable that
[21:17] begins in a certain way
[21:19] and uh and and the and and and what it
[21:22] says here in the scripture we'll go back
[21:24] to it
[21:25] uh and they all with one consent
[21:29] think about it this entire
[21:32] group of people that were made and
[21:34] offered to
[21:35] or given an invitation to and were
[21:38] bitten
[21:39] not one of them decided to take up the
[21:43] invitation
[21:44] because they began to make excuses
[21:49] and the first one said unto him i bought
[21:51] a piece of ground and i must needs go
[21:53] and see it now i do
[21:55] know that in this building this morning
[21:57] and
[21:58] those if some of you out there on the
[22:00] stream are business people
[22:03] what business man buys a piece of ground
[22:05] he ain't seen yet
[22:07] well i i got some i got some desert i'll
[22:10] sell you in florida yeah
[22:12] and i got some beach land i'll say in
[22:15] arizona
[22:17] well if you don't go look if you don't
[22:20] inquire
[22:21] if you're not interested enough and
[22:23] checking it out so
[22:25] i i want you to see how lame these
[22:27] excuses are
[22:29] all right i mean anybody could see right
[22:32] through them
[22:33] yet they're going to use them anyway
[22:36] bought me a piece of ground and i got to
[22:38] go check it out
[22:39] well first thing i think is what a lousy
[22:41] businessman he is
[22:44] right i pray thee have me excused in
[22:47] another
[22:48] verse 19. i bought a me
[22:51] a yoke of oxen and i go to prove them
[22:53] who's going to buy
[22:54] something a horse a a mule a cow an ox
[22:57] without proving it
[23:00] well they could all be lame and blind
[23:02] and halt
[23:04] and not any good at all maybe so old and
[23:08] sway back you couldn't even cut it up
[23:10] and eat it
[23:12] look at look at what's going on excuses
[23:16] are being made right now
[23:18] and the excuses are so poor and so lame
[23:20] yep
[23:22] right and another said i have married a
[23:25] wife and therefore i cannot
[23:27] come i'm surprised the scripture doesn't
[23:30] say but i ain't better yet
[23:35] because that's really the kind of
[23:38] excuses
[23:40] that these folks make right when god
[23:43] sends a servant you're with me
[23:47] now i realize that we're we're we're
[23:49] made up differently here this morning
[23:52] but let's continue so that servant
[23:56] came and showed his lord these things
[23:59] then the master of the house being angry
[24:01] said to his servant go out quickly into
[24:03] the streets and the lanes of the city
[24:05] and bring in hither the poor and the
[24:07] maimed and the halt and the blind
[24:10] and the servant said lord it has done as
[24:12] thou hast commanded and yet there is
[24:14] room
[24:16] and the lord said unto the servant go
[24:18] out into the highways and the hedges and
[24:20] compel
[24:20] them to come in that my house
[24:24] may be full now you may not have paid
[24:28] attention like i have
[24:30] but in this parable the word
[24:34] servant was used three times
[24:38] so we had a first pull and a second pull
[24:42] and a third pole now the third pull was
[24:45] for this servant to go out into the
[24:47] highways
[24:49] look at what the second pool was right
[24:52] healing
[24:54] get the halt the maim and the blind and
[24:56] everybody but how did they make it there
[24:58] right they must have gotten the
[25:01] satisfaction
[25:02] of the of of what the servant had
[25:06] from that certain man that they could
[25:09] walk and they could see
[25:11] you understand that's the second pull
[25:14] what's healing
[25:16] right by the discernment we understand
[25:19] that
[25:21] right and i want to you can cover this
[25:24] for days
[25:25] but we just want to get right down to
[25:27] the nitty-gritty for us this morning
[25:28] amen
[25:30] so then that third time the servant went
[25:33] out
[25:35] lord it is done as thou hast commanded
[25:38] and yet
[25:38] there is room amen and the lord said
[25:42] unto the servant go out into the
[25:44] highways
[25:45] and hedges and compel them to come in
[25:48] that my house may be filled now what i
[25:51] want you to
[25:52] begin to see is the way god operates he
[25:56] does not operate the way you and i think
[25:58] he should operate
[26:00] he does not operate the way that that we
[26:02] operate
[26:04] he is god he doesn't make any mistakes
[26:08] but the really interesting thing about
[26:11] the god we
[26:12] serve is he deals in parables
[26:17] why well uh i didn't put it down in my
[26:21] notes
[26:22] but we could go over to matthew 13 and
[26:25] we could find out why
[26:27] is that right i'm sorry brothers that i
[26:30] didn't give you that scripture but i
[26:31] know you could get it as quick as
[26:32] possible
[26:36] matthew 13 10 and the disciples came and
[26:38] said unto him why speakest thou
[26:40] unto them in parables
[26:44] right who is them well
[26:47] them is who they certain man bade or
[26:50] invited
[26:52] to his great supper
[26:56] he answered and said unto them because
[26:58] it is given unto you to know the
[27:00] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[27:01] but to them it is not given you see
[27:04] they didn't have inside information
[27:08] to know how important this invitation
[27:11] was going to be
[27:13] all they saw was a certain man
[27:18] that certain man in our day traveled
[27:21] around this planet seven
[27:23] times amen
[27:26] and he was just a certain man to most
[27:29] people
[27:30] think about it in the days of jesus
[27:34] who was god manifest in the flesh
[27:38] as the son of god only one tenth
[27:42] of one percent of the population
[27:45] knew who the son of god was
[27:53] you'd say no man everybody must have no
[27:55] no
[27:56] no they didn't have social media back
[27:58] then
[28:00] they didn't have a way to share the good
[28:03] the bad and the ugly to everybody on the
[28:06] planet
[28:09] it was just whoever
[28:12] god called to come in contact
[28:16] so even the disciples who came in
[28:18] contact wanted to know how come
[28:20] lord you're talking so funny why are
[28:23] things hidden
[28:25] why are there mysteries what about
[28:28] these things that are said that we don't
[28:31] understand
[28:34] well it'll be given to you he said
[28:37] that's right for an understanding
[28:40] when you have need of he's still with me
[28:44] this morning
[28:45] amen all right let me go back over to
[28:47] the parable
[28:49] i want you to see something before i
[28:51] move forward this word compel
[28:55] down in verse 23. and compel
[28:59] them to come in that my house may be
[29:03] filled the word compel
[29:06] is to drive or urge forcefully
[29:10] or irresistibly right okay
[29:13] yeah all right so either you're going to
[29:16] be forced
[29:17] or it becomes so irresistible
[29:20] that you arrive compel means to cause to
[29:25] do
[29:26] or occur by overwhelming pressure
[29:32] you don't think the squeeze is numb well
[29:35] the squeeze has been on me
[29:37] ever since i come to the lord 42 years
[29:39] ago
[29:40] but now it's to
[29:43] the highways and the hedges
[29:47] it's to anybody who will listen
[29:51] that you can get to come
[29:54] but i want you to see something here in
[29:56] this parable
[29:58] this is the great supper
[30:03] well wait a minute matthew 22
[30:07] calls it the parable of the marriage
[30:09] feast
[30:12] so is it the great supper or is it the
[30:16] marriage feast
[30:18] well brothers and sisters when it comes
[30:19] right down to it
[30:21] it would become one in the same by
[30:24] revelation
[30:25] but without the revelation one is the
[30:27] great supper
[30:28] and it's just a servant
[30:31] [Laughter]
[30:33] but when those who actually
[30:36] end up showing up by being
[30:40] bitten by being preached to by being
[30:43] compelled and urged
[30:45] to be driven and some of us
[30:49] unfortunately have to be driven is that
[30:51] right
[30:53] because if we're not i'll tell you what
[30:55] the prophet of god
[30:56] said in now i i better read it off the
[31:00] cover because i say sirs what time is it
[31:02] that's not what it's called now is this
[31:05] the sign of the
[31:06] end sir in that message
[31:10] brother branham begins to talk about and
[31:12] i even told the brothers i wasn't
[31:13] reading no quotes
[31:15] but sorry and and those brothers are so
[31:19] quick on the draw back there i'm sure
[31:20] they can get this
[31:22] uh in is this the sign of the end sir
[31:24] paragraph 129.
[31:28] brother branham talking about a dream a
[31:30] brother had his brother jackson
[31:32] and brother branham says and telling the
[31:35] dream
[31:36] and brother jackson said then you picked
[31:38] up something like from the
[31:40] air
[31:45] how you getting it this morning
[31:48] how you been getting it through
[31:52] the air if you understand
[31:56] what we're talking about brother branham
[31:58] broke it down to airwaves and he says
[32:00] you've got to have a crystal inside of
[32:02] you
[32:02] i knew they could do it
[32:06] you got to have a certain thing inside
[32:08] of you to become a receiver
[32:10] of what's being passed through the air
[32:14] now you say well he's talking about a
[32:16] radio oh it's a parable
[32:20] you see some people just hear radio
[32:22] waves
[32:23] but to those like in matthew 13 that it
[32:26] was given to it's given to you
[32:28] to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[32:31] how do we know and my neighbor don't
[32:33] know
[32:34] it's how you receive what's coming
[32:36] through
[32:37] the air so in this dream
[32:40] brother branham picked up something like
[32:42] from the air like something like a
[32:45] wrecking bar don't tell me
[32:49] that this is not the house of
[32:55] you corrections it brother sometimes the
[32:58] preacher be preaching and you're like oh
[33:01] he's beating me to death
[33:04] with a wrecking bar
[33:07] or a crowbar that's even better why
[33:10] because what kept the voice
[33:12] of elijah alive
[33:15] [Laughter]
[33:16] black birds crows you with me ravens
[33:21] they're all same relation if you don't
[33:23] know that he and brother brad says
[33:24] wasn't it brother
[33:26] something like that a wrecking bar real
[33:28] sharp
[33:30] so you got to have yourself studied and
[33:32] approved
[33:33] in order to be able to be used by god to
[33:36] bring
[33:38] something that will cut even to the
[33:42] morrow
[33:43] because it's a sharp two-edged sword
[33:46] and it'll discern what's going on in
[33:49] your life
[33:50] it'll it's so good the word of god is so
[33:52] good
[33:53] that it'll discern what you're going to
[33:55] do tomorrow yeah right
[33:57] that's right and the next day and the
[33:59] next day
[34:00] and what you did last week and the day
[34:02] before that
[34:04] that's how the word of god works that's
[34:07] why you'll say oh
[34:08] brother i was just listening to a
[34:09] message and what you said or i was just
[34:11] reading in the scripture
[34:12] what you said and and i was just talking
[34:13] to a brother or sister about way
[34:15] and lo and behold if it didn't come out
[34:17] from the pulpit
[34:20] then tomorrow you'll run across somebody
[34:22] who will begin to talk to you about the
[34:24] very subject
[34:26] does that happen to you did you know
[34:29] that's the word of god
[34:31] it's working but watch this he says and
[34:35] you struck the top of that mountain and
[34:36] you ripped it around and lifted the cap
[34:38] of it off
[34:39] and it was in the shape of a pyramid and
[34:41] you ripped the top of it off
[34:43] now that was months and months before
[34:45] the pyramid message was preached by the
[34:47] way that's the stature of a perfect man
[34:49] and said beneath that was white stone
[34:52] granite and you said the sun
[34:54] watch now or light has never shined on
[34:56] this before
[34:58] look in on this watch this
[35:01] now here is a place in the message where
[35:05] the prophet of god is conveying to the
[35:07] people through a dream that
[35:09] you need to pay attention to this
[35:13] well how could we pay attention to it if
[35:16] the sun
[35:16] or the light had never shined on it
[35:19] before
[35:20] because it was going to begin to shine
[35:23] on it from the time you started paying
[35:26] attention to it
[35:28] amen oh yeah that's right
[35:31] but if you make an excuse
[35:35] you'll never even get to the great
[35:37] supper
[35:39] which by revelation turns into
[35:42] the marriage feast and you'll see how it
[35:45] works before i'm done
[35:47] i'm watching the clock i probably
[35:48] shouldn't even do it
[35:51] thank you brother samuel and right
[35:52] because in the formation of the world
[35:54] paragraph 130
[35:56] the world was formed before there was
[35:59] light
[36:02] we all know that god moved upon the
[36:05] water
[36:07] that's a type of the spirit then in the
[36:09] beginning he spoke
[36:10] for light and i've always liked to say
[36:13] and i may have said it here before
[36:15] the first thing that came from god was
[36:18] not light
[36:21] and god said it was the spoken word
[36:25] and god said let there be light
[36:29] the first thing that you could see with
[36:31] the natural eye
[36:32] was light but before the natural
[36:35] eye could see something came through the
[36:39] air
[36:40] [Laughter]
[36:41] here with me all right
[36:45] naturally down under there in the age
[36:48] that formation was
[36:51] and i'm going to say that that formation
[36:52] was i realize that it says it that
[36:55] that light had never come upon that
[36:58] stone amen what's a stone
[37:03] it's a revelation it's a confession it's
[37:05] a
[37:06] it's it's something that's revealed to
[37:09] you but light had never
[37:10] shine on it so i want you to get this
[37:12] inside of
[37:13] everybody in here this morning are
[37:15] things that you don't know yet amen
[37:21] but you let the light shine on it
[37:25] amen and you realize that when the light
[37:28] shines on those things that are inside
[37:31] of you today that you're not
[37:33] that you don't even know yet you'll see
[37:35] that it's a stone amen
[37:37] how did that stone got there who put
[37:40] that stone there
[37:42] well it was the creator because he made
[37:46] those stones
[37:50] but light hadn't shined on him yet so
[37:52] there was no writing
[37:54] there's nothing you can read how
[37:58] can you get it if you can't see it
[38:03] you still with me and he said look upon
[38:06] this the light has never
[38:08] come upon it before and brothers and
[38:11] sisters do you understand what's going
[38:12] on here
[38:13] don't focus on brother jackson's dream
[38:15] as much as what's being
[38:17] said you see
[38:20] how can you look upon something that
[38:22] light has never come on before
[38:25] it's it's darkness there's no
[38:29] way for you to see it unless god reveals
[38:33] it to you
[38:33] like he did peter in matthew 16.
[38:38] flesh and blood did not reveal this to
[38:40] you there was no
[38:42] light that shined on this up to the
[38:44] point of peter's statement
[38:46] you see i want you to get this brothers
[38:48] and sisters peter's
[38:50] statement was the light that shined upon
[38:54] the stone that never had
[38:55] light on it before
[38:59] you see that amen and a pond
[39:02] listen now upon this rock upon
[39:05] this stone what stone the fact that the
[39:08] father which is in heaven
[39:10] has revealed it unto you and that brings
[39:13] the
[39:14] light then you begin to see
[39:17] but these folks in the parable in luke
[39:20] 14
[39:21] never allowed the light
[39:25] to shine upon what they did not
[39:28] understand
[39:30] therefore they began to make excuses and
[39:34] and in the day we live in brothers and
[39:35] sisters a lot of
[39:37] excuses are being made they're being
[39:39] made
[39:40] so radically and so drastically that
[39:43] people that have followed this
[39:44] message half or near all their life has
[39:47] said
[39:48] i can't see it anymore that's because
[39:52] you pulled up
[39:53] short and you and you and you disallowed
[39:57] the stone
[39:59] as the scripture says and now you
[40:02] can't see your blind laodicea
[40:05] [Music]
[40:07] amen rich
[40:10] have needham i don't need you that's
[40:13] what people are saying
[40:14] because i got my own thing going on here
[40:19] you understand and you couldn't preach
[40:22] to somebody
[40:23] something that they hadn't already heard
[40:27] but what happens with the preaching of
[40:30] the gospel
[40:31] is that lights come on
[40:34] you remember the old forgive me brother
[40:36] uh samuel because you work for chevrolet
[40:39] general motors but the old commercial
[40:41] with the ford
[40:43] ford has a better idea they said that
[40:45] blink and the little chain would pull
[40:48] and the little light bulb would come on
[40:50] well general motors probably already had
[40:52] them ideas didn't they brother said
[40:55] ford was just promoting it but i want
[40:58] you to understand that's really the way
[40:59] it works
[41:02] as we move forward as we move through
[41:06] as we move into a light
[41:10] comes on hasn't it happened to you
[41:13] haven't you been sitting in the pew all
[41:16] this time
[41:17] and a preacher whether it's one of the
[41:19] home boys or a visitor
[41:21] will come and say something in such a
[41:22] way and you go i see that
[41:25] i see a light came on so you see light
[41:28] never shone on that before
[41:30] but that stone was there all the time
[41:35] but it took something through the air
[41:38] amen
[41:40] so that the top of it could be taken off
[41:43] and you could look inside
[41:45] but here's what most people do
[41:49] most people do now if if i was to uh
[41:52] keep reading and i don't need to you can
[41:54] do it on your own
[41:56] we'll find out that people are like
[41:57] cattle
[42:01] that's what he says here in the next
[42:02] page or two
[42:04] they'll take the path of least
[42:07] resistance
[42:10] you know what i mean they won't pull
[42:12] they won't they won't shove the gate
[42:13] down but if the gates open
[42:16] they just get right hey there we go
[42:18] that's an easy one
[42:19] we'll just wander over there and we'll
[42:22] just wander over there
[42:23] and we'll just wander over there do you
[42:25] know why that people are like cattle
[42:28] according to brother branham very few
[42:30] stayed on
[42:33] to look on to what i had told them
[42:37] brothers and sisters don't give up don't
[42:39] pull short
[42:40] don't stop keep moving
[42:44] keep moving no matter how hard it gets
[42:46] no matter how rough
[42:47] it gets no matter how bad it looks
[42:50] listen now no matter how
[42:51] dark because the light
[42:55] is always with you and it will
[42:59] shine whenever you get to the i noticed
[43:01] this about the life of abraham god
[43:03] talked to abraham and everybody said
[43:05] what's the matter with you he never
[43:08] talked to me
[43:10] and abraham you've got the life of
[43:12] luxury here
[43:14] what do you think you're doing quitting
[43:16] your job
[43:18] and going out where yeah where are you
[43:20] going
[43:23] abraham couldn't tell
[43:26] because he hadn't gotten to the point of
[43:28] the next stone
[43:30] light hadn't shown he it light just
[43:32] shone on abraham
[43:34] take your stuff and go
[43:39] and i want you to notice something in
[43:40] the scriptures abraham wandered around
[43:44] kind of like what we would say pillar to
[43:46] post
[43:48] but when he got to the next destination
[43:52] that god
[43:53] wanted him at he didn't know
[43:56] he didn't know what the next destination
[43:58] was but when he
[43:59] got to the place where god wanted
[44:03] him through all his wandering
[44:06] light shone on a stone
[44:10] that had not been written on before in
[44:12] his life and god spoke to him again
[44:15] okay abraham you finally made it to the
[44:18] place where i
[44:19] wanted you to go god didn't tell him
[44:23] god didn't give him a map the only thing
[44:27] abraham knew was god
[44:29] spoke to me here and told me to go
[44:34] where
[44:36] but he told him to go and that's all
[44:39] abraham needed amen he went
[44:43] on that right he now i want you to know
[44:46] something about humanity abraham had no
[44:49] idea
[44:50] whether god would ever talk to him again
[44:52] or not
[44:55] and you know if god hadn't spoken to him
[44:57] again
[44:58] abraham would have said wow man i must
[45:01] be going crazy
[45:04] yeah yeah right i mean i must be going
[45:06] nuts
[45:07] because i know god talked to me but
[45:10] now he's left me all alone oh no
[45:14] he hasn't left you alone just don't be
[45:17] like these cattle
[45:19] when the prophet of god says something
[45:22] take it to the bank because
[45:24] it's god speaking through him
[45:28] and these folks in luke 14 had no
[45:31] idea who this man was
[45:35] just like we had no idea
[45:40] who the man was that was talking to us
[45:43] until we gave our heart to him
[45:48] i can look back now in my own testimony
[45:52] and look in my life and i didn't give my
[45:54] heart to the lord till i was near 22
[45:57] years old
[45:57] but now i can look back in my past
[46:00] before i give my heart and said oh god
[46:02] was dealing with me
[46:04] god was steering me around abraham
[46:06] didn't realize it but god was turning
[46:08] him
[46:09] abraham would begin to wander over here
[46:11] and that didn't work out
[46:13] so he'd have to wander over here and
[46:15] that didn't work out
[46:17] and he'd have to wander over and finally
[46:18] he got to a place where it looked like
[46:20] he'd had a little grass and some water
[46:22] and god said okay i'll talk to you again
[46:26] but that wasn't his stopping point you
[46:29] see abraham
[46:30] wandered around looking for a city whose
[46:33] builder and maker
[46:34] right was not man i want to clue you in
[46:37] on something this morning i want to
[46:39] shine a little light
[46:41] on that stone do you know that abraham
[46:44] was looking for you and me
[46:48] that's who he was looking for he was
[46:50] looking for a
[46:51] city whose builder and maker was not man
[46:54] and brothers and sisters if you're in
[46:57] the mystical body of christ this morning
[46:59] you did not get there by your own hands
[47:03] because i'll take you to a place in the
[47:05] old testament where he told
[47:06] one of his servants to build an altar he
[47:09] said but don't you
[47:10] unhewn stones those stones should not be
[47:15] handled by man's hands
[47:18] build me that altar amen abraham was
[47:22] looking for us
[47:24] and here we are amen
[47:27] a portion of that city whose builder and
[47:30] maker
[47:31] is not man amen so the whole point of
[47:34] this is in paragraph
[47:36] 133 they were looking in on it in 132
[47:40] brother jackson out of the corner of his
[47:42] eye
[47:44] said he kept one eye on the prophet
[47:48] and he slipped off to one side the
[47:49] prophet did and started going towards
[47:51] the west
[47:52] towards the setting of the sun coming up
[47:54] a hill going down a hill coming up a
[47:55] hill going down a hill
[47:56] getting smaller and smaller and went all
[47:58] the way out of sight what was the coming
[48:00] up the hill and going down the hill and
[48:01] coming up the hill and going down do you
[48:03] know those were pools
[48:05] because the prophet of god said his
[48:06] ministry was like that mountain range
[48:08] that he
[48:09] had he come across up there somewhere on
[48:11] the wyoming
[48:12] montana border in that direction seven
[48:16] peaks
[48:17] three of them were taller than the
[48:18] others up a hill down a hill
[48:20] up a hill down a hill but if you'll
[48:22] notice the last
[48:24] peak the third pull was the highest peak
[48:27] but he got
[48:28] smaller and smaller
[48:32] until he went all the way out of
[48:36] sight that's right
[48:40] here we are today we realize
[48:44] who he is who he was
[48:47] who god sent amen but he's not our
[48:50] christ
[48:52] he's not our god you understand
[48:55] we know that but there are people who
[48:57] are making him
[48:58] way more missing the mark by a long shot
[49:02] they either says nothing or they say
[49:04] he's too much
[49:07] but the true revelation is to understand
[49:10] how he placed himself
[49:13] in the word of god he said i must
[49:17] decrease so that he
[49:21] who christ can increase
[49:24] he's still with me amen all right so
[49:27] down at the
[49:28] paragraph 133 if the brother still got
[49:30] it up there
[49:31] then he said when i did that he said
[49:33] then the brethren
[49:34] turned around after a while now watch
[49:37] he's out of sight
[49:40] he's not here he can't talk
[49:44] for himself he can't straighten out what
[49:46] people are saying about him
[49:48] and he can't live the life anymore in
[49:51] front of the people so they'll know who
[49:52] he is he's out of sight
[49:54] right and when that happened
[49:58] the brethren turned around after a while
[50:00] and said did he vanish
[50:02] where did he go and said some took out
[50:05] that way
[50:06] some took one way some another you see
[50:09] they're all going off on their own
[50:11] like like i know i got a piece of land
[50:15] yeah see what i'm saying i gotta go
[50:17] check it out no i bought some ox
[50:18] hey i married a wife i'll see you all
[50:21] later
[50:22] but a very few stayed
[50:26] and looked on to what i
[50:29] had told amen them
[50:33] now let's go back over to the parable
[50:38] saint luke 14
[50:42] 23 and 24 and the lord said unto the
[50:44] servant
[50:45] go into the highways and the hedges and
[50:47] compel them to come in
[50:49] that my house watch may be
[50:54] filled right now watch this last
[50:57] statement
[50:57] for i say unto you that none
[51:02] oh that's harsh now
[51:06] that hurts but none of those men
[51:10] which were bidden the word bidden now
[51:14] remember
[51:14] is to drive or urge forcefully
[51:18] none of them saw it as irresistible
[51:22] forbidden shall taste of my
[51:26] supper amen so right here is judgment
[51:28] amen
[51:30] he's still with me matthew 22.
[51:34] let's go over to matthew 22 and let's
[51:36] see what now this
[51:37] now we realize that we serve
[51:41] the god of his word amen is that right
[51:45] there's no contradiction now if you
[51:47] believe that i'll pray for you
[51:48] but there's no contradiction
[51:52] in god's word what man does is he begins
[51:55] to
[51:55] use his own reasoning and begin to try
[51:58] to apply that reasoning
[52:01] most of the time because of your own
[52:03] situation
[52:05] your own condition your own
[52:08] circumstances
[52:09] it's as simple as water baptism
[52:12] now here we've got jesus telling them to
[52:14] go into all the world and baptize
[52:16] in the name of the father and of the son
[52:18] and of the holy ghost not
[52:20] fathers not names not
[52:23] sons you understand but in the name of
[52:26] the father and of the son and of the
[52:28] holy ghost
[52:30] and then the man that was given the keys
[52:32] to the kingdom
[52:33] by revelation by a statement of
[52:35] revelation
[52:37] that god gave to him over in the book of
[52:40] acts
[52:40] begins to employ exactly what the lord
[52:45] said in matthew 16 or mark 16.
[52:49] thank you and they were all baptized in
[52:53] the new testament in the name of the
[52:55] lord jesus or jesus christ and the lord
[52:57] it's the lord
[52:59] jesus christ in the name of the father
[53:01] and of the son
[53:02] and of the holy ghost people are still
[53:06] arguing about it
[53:08] and watch watch the cop out oh it don't
[53:11] matter how we're baptized
[53:14] none of those were bitten no that's
[53:17] right because it did not matter to them
[53:20] how it was done they bought land and
[53:23] didn't check it out they bought oxen
[53:25] they didn't prove it
[53:26] and a guy married a wife and i don't
[53:28] even know if he ever saw her
[53:31] well to go along with the rest of the
[53:32] parable you understand
[53:35] she must have been veiled it didn't
[53:36] matter he just
[53:38] wanted to get married now brother
[53:41] branham cautions all you young folks
[53:43] that aren't married yet
[53:45] you pray about it you make sure
[53:48] and this is another thing he says don't
[53:50] marry outside of what you believe
[53:52] happens all the time but don't marry
[53:55] outside of what you believe and i
[53:56] understand the hope
[53:58] yeah it's well they'll come in why don't
[54:01] you lead them in
[54:03] and then if god wants you together
[54:06] then it would be according
[54:10] to the word because if you don't do it
[54:12] according to the word
[54:13] it more than likely will fail if you do
[54:16] it according to the word you're going to
[54:18] be tested
[54:21] and proven but if it's according to god
[54:25] it'll come out in the end you're with me
[54:27] amen
[54:28] so you got you got matthew 22 now this
[54:31] to me is interesting
[54:35] this is matthew
[54:40] the other parable's scribe was luke
[54:44] now luke was a doctor
[54:48] you're with me and they have a specific
[54:51] way of doing
[54:52] things and they see things a certain way
[54:55] and it's their way or the highway very
[54:58] few of them are open
[54:59] forgive me if there's a doctor in here
[55:01] to to to alternatives
[55:04] because they're using their their skill
[55:08] their knowledge uh what they've seen in
[55:11] the past
[55:12] to begin to deal with what's in front of
[55:15] them
[55:17] but matthew worked for the irs
[55:21] [Laughter]
[55:23] now can i ask you a question who is the
[55:25] harder case luke
[55:27] or matthew matthew was a
[55:30] mathematician he was a numbers cruncher
[55:33] he was the guy that decided
[55:36] through calculation how much tax you
[55:38] owed
[55:42] he understood numbers
[55:45] look at the parable it's supposedly the
[55:50] same parable you with me
[55:54] but it's not given the same title luke
[55:57] 14 the marriage feast
[55:59] what do we got here i mean the great
[56:02] supper
[56:03] what we got here is the parable of the
[56:05] marriage feast
[56:06] something has happened
[56:10] what happened light
[56:14] began to shine on this
[56:18] you see that servant in luke 14 was sent
[56:21] out
[56:22] to just get anybody
[56:26] i don't care whether they're sinner or
[56:28] saint
[56:29] i don't care whether they're the trash
[56:31] man
[56:32] whether they're the drug addict whether
[56:35] they're the drunkard
[56:36] whether they're the president i don't
[56:39] care who they are
[56:40] you just speak so that they'll hear
[56:44] and come that my supper
[56:48] will be filled that's a very
[56:52] general way of doing things that's why
[56:55] god sent a prophet
[56:56] amen what you need to see is he sent
[56:59] that
[56:59] servant to compel
[57:03] to urge to bid to
[57:06] offer to request to entreat
[57:11] to invite
[57:16] here we are this morning
[57:20] but that just gets you to the great
[57:24] supper
[57:26] i'm going to tell you folks something
[57:27] right now i got the great supper right
[57:29] here
[57:29] amen hang on let me just here's the
[57:32] great supper
[57:34] right here the message of your hour
[57:37] yes sir if if we lived uh
[57:40] 3 500 years ago i'll have to look in my
[57:43] bible
[57:44] in the days of moses these would have
[57:46] been
[57:47] these would have been printed sure and
[57:49] it would have said
[57:50] moses instead of william branham on the
[57:53] bottom
[57:55] 2000 years ago would have said paul this
[57:58] says jesus
[58:00] from cover to cover you with me
[58:04] but brothers and sisters this is just
[58:06] the great supper if you
[58:08] showed up
[58:12] the marriage feast amen comes by
[58:15] revelation amen amen
[58:16] amen same books
[58:22] same recordings same writings
[58:28] but different feast
[58:31] elevated more specific
[58:35] the great supper is very is it is very
[58:38] general but the marriage
[58:41] feast is specific yes sir
[58:45] you see how matthew by revelation
[58:48] is narrowing it down there's nothing
[58:51] wrong with the parable in luke 14.
[58:54] there's nothing wrong with dr luke
[58:57] but matthew by the grace of god in this
[59:01] instance was given some light
[59:05] that luke didn't have
[59:08] he didn't call it the great supper
[59:11] he called it the marriage feast
[59:15] and look at the other differences would
[59:17] you with me and then we'll close
[59:20] matthew 22 verse 1 and jesus answered
[59:23] and spake unto them again by parables
[59:25] and said the kingdom of heaven
[59:26] is like unto a certain king
[59:30] oh it's a little elevated now and 14 it
[59:34] was a certain man
[59:35] but now it's somebody important
[59:39] pay attention now it doesn't say the
[59:42] king of kings
[59:44] it says a king
[59:48] now let me ask you a question brothers
[59:50] and sisters who are the kings
[59:53] of the king amen i'm looking at him
[59:58] this morning amen kings
[1:00:03] of the king amen you're with me
[1:00:06] so this parable doesn't pinpoint whether
[1:00:09] it's the
[1:00:10] king or a king it just says a certain
[1:00:13] king
[1:00:16] which made a marriage for his son oh
[1:00:19] it's getting a lot more specific
[1:00:23] you see if the folks in luke 14 had
[1:00:26] known it was a king
[1:00:28] and that it was going to be the marriage
[1:00:31] feast
[1:00:34] they might have come
[1:00:37] chances are no because at the end of the
[1:00:40] scripture
[1:00:41] none of those that were bitten right
[1:00:44] they got an invitation but they turned
[1:00:47] it down
[1:00:50] watch verse 3 this is the reason why
[1:00:53] i'll just be public about it
[1:00:55] the fivefold ministry is under attack
[1:00:57] today
[1:01:01] listen careful by those who received
[1:01:04] a servant that's right amen
[1:01:09] and sent forth his servants what
[1:01:12] happened
[1:01:13] what happened to the parable
[1:01:16] it's the same god saying the same words
[1:01:21] to two different men one of the men
[1:01:25] recognizes that a servant
[1:01:30] has servants
[1:01:34] and he sent that servant three
[1:01:38] times in luke 14.
[1:01:42] but i'm gonna i'm gonna throw this at
[1:01:43] you i want you
[1:01:45] to mull and chew on this but
[1:01:48] was the third time the servant in luke
[1:01:52] 14
[1:01:53] him or his servants
[1:01:56] oh it doesn't say servants brother
[1:01:58] that's right
[1:01:59] the message and the messenger
[1:02:03] are one do you believe the message this
[1:02:05] morning if you believe the message this
[1:02:07] morning
[1:02:08] then you will become one with it and
[1:02:10] when you become
[1:02:11] one with that message you become one
[1:02:14] with that messenger
[1:02:15] and now it's not servant it's servants
[1:02:20] amen exactly so you now
[1:02:23] have become a messenger from god
[1:02:27] amen and you know what your message is
[1:02:33] to live what's been said
[1:02:38] that's what jesus message really was
[1:02:42] why do you condemn me he said for
[1:02:45] for a good no no no not for the good
[1:02:47] works but for you being a man who make
[1:02:49] yourself
[1:02:50] god that choked
[1:02:53] them do you know brothers and sisters
[1:02:57] that that's what will
[1:02:58] choke the church world today is there
[1:03:02] there are here on this planet now
[1:03:05] people who are beginning to become the
[1:03:07] living word
[1:03:09] and it will begin to choke those who
[1:03:12] cannot see it manifesting in their life
[1:03:16] and they will become our condemners
[1:03:21] sir can we keep going
[1:03:25] i got a little bit of time
[1:03:29] and sent forth verse 3 his servants to
[1:03:31] call them
[1:03:32] that were bidden i want you to see this
[1:03:36] they were already bidden yes how do we
[1:03:39] know that
[1:03:41] luke 14. they were already invited
[1:03:45] they were all the offer was already made
[1:03:48] how is it made
[1:03:49] by the prophet amen by the message that
[1:03:52] the prophet left
[1:03:53] the invitation and the offer
[1:03:57] has been here but now the servants
[1:04:02] are going to be used to call them
[1:04:07] that's right so you get that look at it
[1:04:12] to call them that we're already bidding
[1:04:17] already invited already knew god sent a
[1:04:20] prophet
[1:04:21] right amen i already understood that in
[1:04:23] the bible
[1:04:26] behold i will send you elijah the
[1:04:30] prophet
[1:04:32] is that right now some of you folks may
[1:04:35] or may not know this but there's two
[1:04:37] parts to malachi
[1:04:38] 4 6 he will turn the hearts of the
[1:04:40] fathers to the children
[1:04:44] you got that do you want to read it
[1:04:48] brothers can you put malachi 4 6 up
[1:04:50] there
[1:04:53] yeah i know i'm still using my bible
[1:04:56] i'm good with that
[1:05:00] 4 5 malachi 4 5
[1:05:04] behold i will send you elijah the
[1:05:06] prophet before
[1:05:08] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[1:05:10] of the lord and brothers and sisters can
[1:05:12] i ask you a serious question are we not
[1:05:14] on the threshold
[1:05:16] amen of a dreadful day
[1:05:22] now why would it be great
[1:05:25] look up your redemption draws nigh
[1:05:29] don't sweat what's going on in the
[1:05:31] political world and
[1:05:32] in the church world and in the west
[1:05:34] world in that world
[1:05:36] look up don't let your head hang down
[1:05:39] look up
[1:05:40] why because when this may be the darkest
[1:05:43] and most evil day
[1:05:44] that's ever been but it is the golden
[1:05:52] you may not realize it but this is the
[1:05:54] day that the lord hath made
[1:05:56] and it's the one that abraham was
[1:05:58] looking for
[1:06:01] that's why it's a great day but it's
[1:06:03] very dreadful
[1:06:04] especially for those who were bidden and
[1:06:07] wouldn't
[1:06:08] come and then they're told
[1:06:11] you ain't coming right none
[1:06:15] of those that were bitten that refused
[1:06:17] the first
[1:06:18] call can come
[1:06:22] but here we go watch this
[1:06:25] malachi 4 6 and he shall turn the heart
[1:06:30] of the fathers to the children
[1:06:33] and the heart of the children to their
[1:06:37] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[1:06:40] with a curse
[1:06:43] you don't find that interesting i do and
[1:06:46] here's what i've been told by many
[1:06:48] ministries
[1:06:49] brother branham only fulfilled half of
[1:06:51] that
[1:06:52] only the part that john the baptist
[1:06:54] fulfilled he only the message this is
[1:06:57] what people are conveying they've only
[1:06:59] turned
[1:07:00] the heart of the fathers to the children
[1:07:03] hear me now and so they have to
[1:07:07] because they only see half of that
[1:07:09] fulfilled
[1:07:10] they have to say he's coming back
[1:07:15] he's coming back because we believe he's
[1:07:17] the one and he didn't fulfill
[1:07:19] all that was said about him because he
[1:07:22] hasn't turned
[1:07:23] this is what they say the heart
[1:07:27] of the children to the fathers and i and
[1:07:29] and i've been confronted by it
[1:07:31] and i and i told the people i've got
[1:07:33] news for you
[1:07:35] too late the heart of this child
[1:07:39] has already been turned back to the
[1:07:42] pentecostal
[1:07:43] original i'm not talking about 1906 now
[1:07:47] i'm talking about 2 000 years
[1:07:50] ago when what happened a servant
[1:07:54] was sent to bid
[1:07:57] to them to come to the great feast and
[1:08:00] israel crucified him
[1:08:03] turned him down so he went out into the
[1:08:06] highways and the byways and the hedges
[1:08:09] and he collected some disciples now he
[1:08:12] had many followers
[1:08:13] when he was breaking the bread and the
[1:08:15] fish when
[1:08:16] the healing campaign was going on in his
[1:08:19] second pool he had
[1:08:21] lots of followers but when he said
[1:08:24] unless you eat the flesh
[1:08:25] and drink the blood of the son of man
[1:08:27] what kind of a statement is that
[1:08:29] it's a statement that light hadn't
[1:08:31] shined on yet
[1:08:34] he was beginning to un to cut off the
[1:08:37] top
[1:08:38] and show the disciples a stone that
[1:08:40] hadn't been written on yet
[1:08:42] why because they would become ridden
[1:08:44] epistles
[1:08:45] right right you shall become written
[1:08:49] epistles read of all men that's why
[1:08:52] those seven unknown thunders on the back
[1:08:54] of the book
[1:08:55] look like there's no writing amen but
[1:08:58] that same
[1:08:59] prophet said that in the last days the
[1:09:02] real
[1:09:02] true church amen
[1:09:05] would understand those seven he didn't
[1:09:07] call him thunders
[1:09:09] he said voices
[1:09:12] you're with me now they become a voice
[1:09:16] they're no longer a noise that you have
[1:09:18] to be afraid of
[1:09:19] that you have to cower down to that you
[1:09:21] don't understand
[1:09:23] they are becoming a voice to you
[1:09:28] you're with me how do we know that
[1:09:31] because over there in what saint john 12
[1:09:33] i think it is
[1:09:35] is that the one where where it thundered
[1:09:37] and some said
[1:09:38] it was a prophet uh some say it was this
[1:09:40] and so angels is talking to him
[1:09:43] brother branham tells us that jesus
[1:09:46] understood what was being said so it was
[1:09:49] the voice
[1:09:51] of god to him see how important it is
[1:09:56] to sit in the house of the lord yeah
[1:09:59] it's saint john 12 i just wanted to
[1:10:00] check
[1:10:01] there in verse 28. you still with me
[1:10:05] brothers and sisters
[1:10:06] let me get let me let me find a place
[1:10:08] where we can pull off
[1:10:10] till this afternoon all right
[1:10:15] oh yeah it gets good for me it gets good
[1:10:19] so so here we are verse 3 and sent forth
[1:10:23] his servants to call them
[1:10:25] and remember many are called but few
[1:10:29] are chosen call them that were bidden to
[1:10:31] the wedding and they
[1:10:32] would not come and again he sent forth
[1:10:36] this is different now
[1:10:38] the other servant went out did didn't
[1:10:41] get the results that he wanted
[1:10:43] he he went to the to the the hefe
[1:10:47] to the one that sent him and told him
[1:10:51] well watch this second round
[1:10:55] he sent forth other servants saying
[1:10:58] tell them which are bidden behold
[1:11:02] now there's a message coming with it
[1:11:04] he's given these servants a revelation
[1:11:06] to begin to preach
[1:11:09] you see what the other servant did not
[1:11:11] divulge he did not give it out
[1:11:14] he told the people you stay here and you
[1:11:16] look on this
[1:11:18] but most of the people left very few men
[1:11:22] and or women would stick around
[1:11:25] and say okay this must be prophecy
[1:11:29] this must be for the future this must be
[1:11:31] for something that's coming
[1:11:33] and then as it began to come guess what
[1:11:35] you found out
[1:11:36] you and me became
[1:11:40] the fulfillment of the prophecies that
[1:11:42] were
[1:11:43] said years ago that didn't make
[1:11:46] any sense to the people
[1:11:50] just like isaiah behold a virgin shalt
[1:11:53] come on
[1:11:54] come on behold the virgin that is not
[1:11:58] possible that's right except for one
[1:12:02] phrase
[1:12:03] all things are possible to those
[1:12:06] that believe you're with me and
[1:12:10] 700 or 800 years later 740 or whatever
[1:12:13] it was
[1:12:14] a young girl a young girl who the
[1:12:17] prophet of god tells us and spoken word
[1:12:19] is the original seed
[1:12:20] learned isaiah's statement on the knees
[1:12:25] of her mother exactly what is a mother
[1:12:29] it's your church
[1:12:33] and you're learning right now on the
[1:12:35] knees of your
[1:12:36] mother a statement that was made that
[1:12:39] could not be understood could not be
[1:12:42] scientifically proven
[1:12:44] could could not be handled by people for
[1:12:47] years now brother madam told us this
[1:12:49] that there were handfuls of women
[1:12:52] virgins because you had to
[1:12:56] qualify kind of like the ministry today
[1:12:58] you got to
[1:12:59] qualify now just because you qualify
[1:13:02] doesn't make you a minister called by
[1:13:04] god
[1:13:05] but you do have to be a virgin in order
[1:13:08] to be able to fulfill
[1:13:10] isaiah you're with me
[1:13:14] handfuls would begin to think could be
[1:13:16] me
[1:13:17] could be me could be me first date
[1:13:20] second age third age fourth age
[1:13:23] fifth age sixth stage and then we even
[1:13:25] got to the seventh age
[1:13:27] and the pentecostals believed that they
[1:13:29] reached the summit
[1:13:32] brother banham said no no no no
[1:13:35] no you're just getting started
[1:13:39] can you start with me today brothers and
[1:13:41] sisters do you realize that
[1:13:43] we're just getting started and you go i
[1:13:45] don't know brother it doesn't look like
[1:13:47] we have much time oh we don't need
[1:13:49] time because time shall be no more
[1:13:53] now the clock is still moving there's
[1:13:55] still three and a half years of
[1:13:56] tribulation there's still a thousand
[1:13:58] years of the money in the city you see
[1:13:59] the calendar's still working but for the
[1:14:01] bride
[1:14:02] when she starts she's done because
[1:14:05] brother branham said when god
[1:14:06] says anything no matter how many years
[1:14:10] it might take in god's
[1:14:13] thinking it's finished he doesn't look
[1:14:15] over his shoulder and check to see
[1:14:16] he let there be light oh where's that
[1:14:18] sun at i know that sun's going to come
[1:14:20] up oh get that cloud out of the way no
[1:14:22] no he just keeps moving like those four
[1:14:25] living creatures he just keeps
[1:14:26] moving forward right
[1:14:30] that's brothers and sisters the god we
[1:14:32] serve and
[1:14:33] that's the way we should be amen
[1:14:38] now how long have i been up here i'm
[1:14:42] asking for a good reason
[1:14:45] oh hour and 20 minutes
[1:14:48] somebody must be getting hungry
[1:14:53] wait a minute oh yeah
[1:14:56] no but i i i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:14:59] close here in a minute
[1:15:01] but i'm gonna start out with this out of
[1:15:04] blasphemous names
[1:15:07] brother branham at the end of the
[1:15:08] message says now one
[1:15:11] thing more i'll give you brothers these
[1:15:14] quotes i'm not going to read them
[1:15:16] he's talking about his two climaxes
[1:15:19] think about it
[1:15:21] two climaxes why didn't he say
[1:15:24] three climaxes because brother branham
[1:15:28] tried
[1:15:29] without the understanding forgive me if
[1:15:32] this offends you but he did not have the
[1:15:33] understanding
[1:15:35] of not being able to explain the third
[1:15:37] poll how do we know that because the
[1:15:39] angel
[1:15:40] said i told you not to try to explain it
[1:15:47] but he tried and he tried
[1:15:50] and he tried and i don't believe brother
[1:15:52] branham was
[1:15:53] was out in the open uh cognitively
[1:15:57] going against what the angel told him
[1:15:59] don't believe that for a second
[1:16:02] but i do believe brother branham
[1:16:03] misunderstood
[1:16:05] what the angel meant when he told him
[1:16:08] don't try to explain it
[1:16:11] why did he tell him that and then why
[1:16:14] did brother branham continue
[1:16:16] to try to tell people how it
[1:16:20] worked two reasons one the angel
[1:16:23] said don't do it because you can't
[1:16:28] you can't explain the third
[1:16:31] poll i won't be able to tell you the
[1:16:35] difference between the servant's
[1:16:37] first message in luke 14 and his last
[1:16:40] message in luke 14
[1:16:42] that got some people in the house
[1:16:47] you're with me all right the first
[1:16:49] message didn't work yeah no i had
[1:16:51] rejected
[1:16:52] everybody all with one consent
[1:16:56] what did the why
[1:17:01] i can imagine back in those days come on
[1:17:03] man
[1:17:05] this guy hadn't even got an education
[1:17:07] yeah he didn't even go to school
[1:17:11] you see he he he's it's his hillbilly
[1:17:15] yeah there ain't no way
[1:17:17] oh he's got a gift but there ain't no
[1:17:19] way god called him
[1:17:21] to bring no important message
[1:17:25] he gets that's that those excuses were
[1:17:27] made by the
[1:17:28] even his own pastor dr roy davis
[1:17:32] said come on billy you
[1:17:36] huh think about it you you're gonna go
[1:17:40] out and you're gonna preach the kings
[1:17:42] and potates
[1:17:44] give me a break you don't even know your
[1:17:45] abcs
[1:17:48] well he did learn them
[1:17:52] always believe christ he learned his
[1:17:56] abcs
[1:17:57] whether you know it or not brothers and
[1:17:59] sisters algebra is not that difficult
[1:18:03] if you understand the theory
[1:18:06] of algebra without understanding
[1:18:10] it might as well be a foreign language
[1:18:12] that you never have
[1:18:13] seen before brothers and sisters i
[1:18:16] believe this is not a foreign language
[1:18:18] to us
[1:18:20] i believe we've seen these things before
[1:18:24] where brother i'm only so-and-so i i
[1:18:27] haven't been in the message
[1:18:28] i don't know the bible i don't know oh
[1:18:30] in the mind of god before the foundation
[1:18:32] of the world
[1:18:33] but you see god kept that to himself he
[1:18:35] didn't want light to shine on that yet
[1:18:37] so there was no writing
[1:18:38] and i'll tell you why there was no
[1:18:40] writing on it because he didn't want the
[1:18:41] enemy to get a hold
[1:18:42] of him you see what was on the back of
[1:18:45] the book is still inside the book
[1:18:47] but it's not written legibly in the book
[1:18:50] except written epistles
[1:18:52] you're becoming the fulfillment
[1:18:55] of what looks like the unwritten
[1:18:58] word how is that possible because
[1:19:02] light now is going to shine on what was
[1:19:05] in god's mind before the foundation of
[1:19:07] the world amen
[1:19:11] and i've already been attacked by this
[1:19:12] so i know the counter punch
[1:19:14] oh come on brother god sent a prophet
[1:19:17] and a prophet is the last moving part in
[1:19:19] the body
[1:19:20] and i can't disagree with that the mouth
[1:19:23] and the eyes
[1:19:24] he says the eyes it's the last moving
[1:19:25] part right
[1:19:27] ah but he says in another place there's
[1:19:29] one thing left
[1:19:31] the intelligence and whether you realize
[1:19:34] it or not the reason why we're being
[1:19:36] fought so hard be all by all the enemies
[1:19:39] including our own
[1:19:40] fallen nature is because the thoughts of
[1:19:44] god
[1:19:45] unseen thoughts are becoming
[1:19:49] by the light shining on them for the
[1:19:51] hour they're in
[1:19:53] written epistles red of
[1:19:57] all men now some men will read you
[1:20:01] and they will be condemned amen none of
[1:20:04] them which were bitten
[1:20:06] to the great supper
[1:20:10] but the marriage feast turns the corner
[1:20:14] and it's because now the revelation is
[1:20:16] not just on one man
[1:20:18] listen brothers and sisters if god
[1:20:19] wanted to keep all this to himself and
[1:20:22] do it all himself he would have remained
[1:20:24] elohim
[1:20:25] we would have remained thoughts inside
[1:20:27] of him and we and
[1:20:29] and there had to be some way of
[1:20:30] communicating come on now you all have a
[1:20:32] mind don't you
[1:20:34] does everybody in this room except for
[1:20:36] you sleeping is everybody in this room
[1:20:38] thinking
[1:20:39] of something either i'm a nut
[1:20:42] or whoa i never heard this before yeah
[1:20:45] the brothers preach on that all the time
[1:20:47] or you know whatever's going on in here
[1:20:48] i'm hungry
[1:20:52] and blasphemous names we're going to
[1:20:53] find out that the people got hungry
[1:20:55] and began to leave he wouldn't stick
[1:20:58] around long enough
[1:21:00] they wouldn't look upon those things
[1:21:02] that they didn't understand
[1:21:04] so their natural appetite began to take
[1:21:06] over and it's like okay man i can't take
[1:21:08] this anymore
[1:21:12] how did jesus fast
[1:21:15] for 40 days what was he living on
[1:21:20] if i fasted for four days i wouldn't be
[1:21:23] worth much
[1:21:25] unless i came in contact
[1:21:29] with the god who created
[1:21:32] all nature then he would take over down
[1:21:35] in the engine room
[1:21:37] and no matter how weak or how tempted
[1:21:40] or how tired how numb
[1:21:44] how hungry we could keep going
[1:21:47] did you know it's a great and dreadful
[1:21:51] day
[1:21:53] please stand i'll take off from there
[1:21:56] i can i can make this in two parts ease
[1:22:00] you love the lord amen did i did i pick
[1:22:03] up on somebody was getting hungry
[1:22:06] no no but it but but but in blasphemous
[1:22:10] names
[1:22:11] listen it didn't happen to the servants
[1:22:13] it happened to the servant yes sir
[1:22:15] amen he was preaching amen and people
[1:22:19] got tired now
[1:22:22] i'm gonna ask y'all a personal question
[1:22:24] i don't want you to raise your hand or
[1:22:25] answer it out loud
[1:22:27] but if brother samuel was to turn on a
[1:22:30] message
[1:22:30] of brother branham every sunday morning
[1:22:33] how many of you could stay awake
[1:22:36] but when god has a living servant
[1:22:40] which are servants get behind this
[1:22:44] sacred desk and then begin you're going
[1:22:46] to find out before we're done it's not a
[1:22:48] different message
[1:22:50] they preached the same message
[1:22:53] but god gave them things to say to the
[1:22:57] people
[1:22:57] that would begin to shine light
[1:23:02] that had never shined on that spot
[1:23:05] before
[1:23:06] yeah let's pray father
[1:23:09] help me lord because lord this message
[1:23:13] is real
[1:23:14] this message is for us lord and it's
[1:23:17] condensated down from you
[1:23:20] to a servant to servants lord
[1:23:24] and all of us in one way or another are
[1:23:26] servants lord here to
[1:23:27] serve here to serve others father
[1:23:31] as you served us
[1:23:34] we pray that you would help us with our
[1:23:36] revelation lord
[1:23:38] that you would help us to see father
[1:23:39] that we are part and partakers
[1:23:42] of this third pull father we've come to
[1:23:46] that place
[1:23:47] lord we've heard the phrase we know the
[1:23:49] term
[1:23:50] we can locate it father in the
[1:23:52] scriptures and in the message
[1:23:55] but father up to this point it has just
[1:23:58] been words on pages
[1:24:00] they've just been things that have been
[1:24:02] said by your servant lord i can see now
[1:24:06] unless you eat the flesh and drink the
[1:24:08] blood of the son of man you have no life
[1:24:10] in you
[1:24:11] that statement was made lord to shine
[1:24:14] light
[1:24:15] and to separate it is truly a great
[1:24:19] and dreadful day lord and we have
[1:24:22] arrived father
[1:24:24] and we believe lord that we're not
[1:24:26] children of darkness but
[1:24:27] children of light and we are the light
[1:24:30] as we walk in the light lord
[1:24:34] help your children to better understand
[1:24:36] your word lord
[1:24:39] which will help them better understand
[1:24:41] themselves
[1:24:42] and as they better understand themselves
[1:24:44] lord they'll begin to better understand
[1:24:46] the word
[1:24:48] we love you and we thank you we'll give
[1:24:51] you all the praise and the honor and the
[1:24:53] glory
