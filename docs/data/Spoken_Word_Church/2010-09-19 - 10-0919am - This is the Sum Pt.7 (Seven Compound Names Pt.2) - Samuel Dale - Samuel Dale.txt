appreciate it every but just let's see I'm trying to remember if I'm missing any announcements but any now let's read our scripture and just go right on in something seems I'm lighting up and down Josh on the thing is is it that working okay I seem to be moving in and out myself that's reason I'm saying that's reason I'm talking like that cuz it seems to be going up and down so if it starts we I change a battery or something but anyhow let's get into our scripture Hebrews 8 and Ecclesiastes 12 that for Matt and and BB and and Zach to be with us today appreciate that father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for saving us for your guiding us thank you for being you Lord we ask you now that you would just help us and bless each one remember way there as he's ministering today Lord and just Bless the people and then remember him flying back home and just give him a safe journey we love you and we thank you and we commit everything into your hands and asking you to forgive our sins and have us Lord in that way we can stand in your presence and Lord then we can believe your word we commit it to you now have your way as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts guide us now in Jesus name amen now remember our point of what we've been bringing that Paul is saying here in the book of Hebrews now the things which we have spoken of this is the sum now of the things what all of the whole thing that he spoke spoken of and he is to some we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens what a wonderful thought to be thinking about you know who our Lord and our savior is okay Ecclesiastes when he's finishing up he said let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word let me set this ban here at least running now we've been speaking for quite a while on the the things that I said the bringing it like from a partial understanding to a perfect understanding and you know trying to uh bring things into the situation that we can we can understand uh the things of God you know and I I hope you've been enjoying it I really have myself just thinking on it and doing it now this past Wednesday then we took and I hope you have the notes that we gave if you don't have the notes we gave on Wednesday uh would you please just let us know and we'll try to uh get you a copy of Cu we want you to uh do it I hope if you didn't get it you got to be able to see our hearers on the internet all right now what we've been doing or what we was doing this past Wednesday was you just brother especially if it's one of those or so of this one has everybody got a copy of this one this the seven compound names do anybody I didn't think about it brother if there's not enough in our brother Joe will run some off on the the uh computer back at the back so you know if you have those but especially read those notes because what we done Wednesday was just read what brother randam said and I hope you you enjoyed it to be able to just see what he was saying about the compound names of Jehovah all right and how that they all must be found in Jesus Christ right now so that was what Dr brother Bosworth asked Dr beess you know to the seven compound names of Jehovah apply to Jesus Christ yes or no well he couldn't answer it because if he said yes on one side no on the other side he would have been wrong and he knew it so he couldn't answer him to to that but my point this past Wednesday was one thing I want to restate it to you that do we count all of the Redemptive names of Jehovah do we count them as all to be the same value I don't know of any other way to say it or whatever to do but I believe that's where we're missing the way that we need to be seeing God okay because we put uh a lot of emphasis and thank God for it upon Jehovah Gyra which which would be the Lord's provided sacrifice and Amen on that because everything is connected to do into that and like I said if you didn't have him as Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided sacrifice then you wouldn't have him as as Jehovah RI the Healer you wouldn't have him as Jehovah TI you you know our righteousness none of that would have be of any value right had he been we say well we were just uh the the stripes brought it I tried to bring that out Wednesday if you just had the beating the back of the Lord Jesus the blood running out without the death at Calvary right you wouldn't have no healing right cuz it takes life to heal the blood is not what heals you it is not taking a compound you know of the blood and putting it on you it's faith in the blood it's faith in the blood that was shed for you that heals you all right and if it hadn't been the shedding of the blood see if there hadn't been a sacrifice there would be no uh point of even talking about healing or anything else so that was what I was trying to say Wednesday and I want you to think on those things I believe we put emphasis upon the Jehovah Gyra which you know is the Lord provided sacrifices we'll get in a minute but I don't believe that we put enough emphasis upon all of the other you know compound names which are not names they are titles to a name because there's only one name and that's the name of Jesus but then you got those uh compound names as revealing you remember we brought out brother Brandon was talking about how that through those names it would be brought out about his attributes would be revealed how that his nature would be revealed even God's attitude read those notes and and look at them even his attitude toward man would be brought out through the revealing of his name all right and even to the bases of the very nature or character of God would be displayed through those things and and you know and we could look at it all right and remember now that you cannot separate those names so you can't make one greater than the other as I said it's all hinged upon whether or not he was our sacrifice Jehovah Gyra yes sir read it all hinges upon that but was he going to just display that he was the Healer what is the attributes of God savior healer Redeemer all the things is his attributes well then being his attributes was one greater than the other you know where would we get the idea that that would be but I believe that's where we miss our healing sure we want to say that we're saved and like I said Wednesday you wouldn't dare to get anybody you know walk up somebody are you saved yes I'm saved but didn't you walk up to somebody say are you healed well don't know now how what would give us the right to say that right well healing is just temporary brother Dale but it's already paid for it's already finished we're the ones that's limiting that that's what I was trying to get across Wednesday I want to get into the names you know and just cover the scripture but I want you to see what I trying to say if we look at him as Jehovah Gyra but we make it of some lesser value or some uh you know way of De demoting down or whatever you would call it I don't have the education so I just talk in plain sense that I got on my own that's very little but how can you make one greater than the other if he is one I gave him to you there Wednesday brother R said he if he is Jehovah Gyra then he must also be Jehovah Raa our healer right but now if he's not our healer he's not our savior that's right if he's not our savior he's not our healer either way you want to go backwards and forth everywhere you want to go you can't separate it cuz he's the same yesterday today and forever am but see I believe that we we put too much emphasis upon now and I don't Heaven Help Me forgive me you know somebody listening to me they don't what in the world I'm talking about anyway and I guess that's true but we put emphasis upon the fact that he is our savior but do we put the same emphasis upon the fact that he's our healer right well in a way I guess you could say that now there's no such thing you remember how we were bringing it out from page 31 there the church age book where brother random was talking about if we believe that he died for us us we must believe that we're just as righteous as he is by being in him he said to accept one is to accept the other to reject one is to reject the other that's right and I bring that over to what we're talking about here that to reject the fact that each one of the compound names of Jehovah is trying to reveal God to us and to turn that down and say well I don't know sometimes I feel like I'm Healed sometimes I don't feel like I'm Healed that's what's wrong with us that's right Amen brother God's word don't talk that way amen God says we're healed God says we're perfect God says we're righteous amen but I just can't see it that's what's wrong so we're putting not the correct value you up the point that I'm trying to make we're trying to make one thing greater than the other now how can you do that that was the whole thing of Wednesday night you know and I know I was my wife even said going home you know said sometimes you found sound like you just having trouble starting off and all but I want you to get it I don't care what it takes amen I mean we can go here six and seven sermons and amen and all like that that's wonderful and good you know and the exhorted messages I love that but I still like to just get down and think about it that's right you know then somebody preaches an exhorting message I got something to shout about I know what I'm doing I'm happy then but now get let's get that and then we'll get off of it if he's greater in one way than he is in the other how can you make him God right well you just don't understand but I agree so you got to pull pit this evening you explain it to us okay no sarcasm just truth sisters or whatever give you the ppit this evening and you explain how that he can be greater on one thing than he can on the other and then you make him Hebrews 13:8 see we're we're not counting it in the correct way especially to get down to the last one that I told you that I kind of moved these around from what they were in the run off the computer not not not R around them now the computer thing to where that it showed you know the seven compound Redemptive names I moved them around purposely because I wanted to bring it out a certain way and to finish it up by saying Jehovah shal Jehovah Tom Mar which means his presence but do we believe he's here we amen amen now how could you ever be saved if you wouldn't hear amen but do you put that on there though do you put that value exactly like your salvation not no that's that's what we're not doing all right so we need to do that but now let's just get into to the message for or the part today I want you to see because for me to keep on harping on that will not show you a thing that's what everybody thinks you know no but revealing of the word of God will show us the truth so then we'll we'll learn the truth from that all right so now the first one that we look at is Jehovah Gyra so if you want to go ahead and turn to Genesis 22 then let's just start on these seven Redemptive names or compound names of Jehovah and like I said now be this sensible talking it's not names because there's not seven names of God there are seven uh manifestations of God cuz there not said seven spirits of God there's it's the spirit of God in each Church age manifesting itself and the Seven Redemptive names is God revealing under those names his nature his character his way what he has been doing what he's doing now and what he'll continue to do it's being revealed throughout the word of God okay so then we will find those things and now some of the these words I'll try to remember them when I get there some of these words are spelled different in some forms and you will not find a couple of them as actually being Jehovah Rah R A- ah which is the Lord our the Lord our my shepherd uh you won't find that word Jehovah re in the scriptures there are some I think there's five of them in the scriptures maybe and a couple of them that are not but let's go over there and look at it Jehovah Gyra now why would he be called Jehovah Gyra well it means the Lord will provide okay so let's go over in Genesis and just pick these and go kind of slow with it and just read the scriptures and things you know and and see what's going on now we know the background story of what here is happening in Genesis 2 22 this is the time that Abraham is told to take his son upon the mountain and kill him now he starts out and he comes to the place to where that he's fulfilling what God is saying now what about God asking him or telling a man to go kill his only son he said now wait a minute God doesn't do things like that well what kind of a God are you got you know I mean it's in the Bible well God wouldn't ask us to kill one of our kids now somebody's already done that but what if he asked you to believe the word you got any problems you got any problems of with him asking you to do something you you understand what I'm saying God called me to preach well I just do what he called me to do okay I I I I've never been a Hell's Angels and I don't have tattoos all over my bodies and I never was a drunk I never was a dop adct and things like that so I don't have any anything to brag about you know that's what most preachers do you know they try to tell you where all they come from all I can do is preach you know that's just the only ability I have that's you know I don't have all that other to brag about I was sinner enough you know but I just have to to be what I am but all right now what happened to Abraham we know the story that he goes and he's going to offer Isaac he's going to do what God told him Isaac up about the 11th verse you know whatever uh 10th 11th he said uh you know in other words father he's getting kind of concerned about that time you know cuz he looks around and there they work here in the wood and carrying the fire and you know now they didn't carry the fire the whole 3 days so evidently the last day they buil them a fire you know and they picked up and they started down the road going on and left the servants over there you know and y'all stay here the Lin I go and the ltin I shall return now that's what Abraham had said cuz he believed it but what was he going to do he was going to go kill his only son right you know I like the way brother Richard Wilson says about it he said he didn't have nothing to bring him from and he got a son named Isaac no no hulks no whatsoever now if he took him up there and burned him he'd at least have some ashes you know so Abraham had a whole lot more you know than you'd think all right but he he's going up you know the little lad says uh you know here's the fire and here's the wood you got a knife but said where's the sacrifice so I like what it says and Abram made his Abraham made his statement verse 8 he said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering now you can read that two ways but it comes back to the same answer so you can read that is saying now son God's going to provide a lamb that's what he done but then you can read it the other way of said now son God will provide himself a lamb that's two ways looking at it ain't but you know to come out to be the same thing because wound up with a lamb but it was a prophecy of what Calvary that God would himself come down to die for our sins he wouldn't send a son he didn't send a second person he came himself so the Lord provided a sacrifice a lamb for Abraham in a natural but he was saying one of these days there's going to be a great sacrifice coming and the Lord himself is going to take care of that son see because this is working but like I told you Abraham is going up there and you know what the lamb that he was going to offer cuz he's told to do it the lamb he thought he was going to offer was his son that true now he said now he had this great no if he had that great Revelation why didn't he walk out there and find a lamb tied in the bushes and grab it and take off with it no no no no get the whole story he was just plain oh honest man walking up there he was going to go do what God told him to do that's right God told him to kill his son that's right he's going to go do it amen cuz he believed God that's but see then God comes on the scene and says okay now I'll take care of it bring a lamb so he did see God stopped his hand he had him right up ready to kill him verse 10 11 all and God calls from Heaven the angel of the Lord called out if you'll notice that's big old capital l r d he calls out unto him and he says you know hold your hand just St don't do it Abram lifted up his eyes verse 133 and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him for a burnt offering in the stead of his son now verse 14 and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen Jehovah Gyra actually it means Jehovah c s e e s is the way it's really pronounced Jehovah SE are in other words God sees the need and he's going to take care of it right right because he's Jehovah Gyra our Lord's sacrifice and I think that we need to see you know if anything I think you and I need to see who our sacrifice is right cuz I said There Goes Abraham up there to offer his son he thought that was the one that he was going to kill and he fully had it in his mind to go do it cuz God told him am but then God steps on the scene and provides a natural lamb for Abraham showing that it calv what would take place that the Lord himself would descend right not another person's here you get another person your sacrifice is wrong now Abraham at that time had another son right they believe his name was ishma but God made it specifically the point saying Abraham take thine son thine only son right all right we know the story ishmail never come from when his name was Abraham Ishmael came when his name was Abram right amen all right so Abram was the father of you know ish right but then his name was changed to Abraham right and that made him the father of Isaac but now if you go to reading your scriptures see people don't read and try to keep the story straight if you'll keep reading if you don't last me I'll show you on the computer and you'll find out that the scripture talks about ishma being the son of Abraham why because he's the same man right right right right it's just distinguishing the fact of thine son thine only son promised son is what you're talking about right Isaac was the promised son okay that's why Abraham was going to offer him right he was the promised son all right but he stopped because God stopped him to show him who the real promised son was going to be and that would be Jesus Christ but now watch what I'm the point I'm trying to get you to say see he said he would provide a lamb verse eight God will provide a lamb all right so it's easy to understand so it was written out there and the scripture and they actually wrote out the name and said is this the name of this place here will be Jehovah Gyra because God saw the need Jehovah overseas and he became the sacrifice right now that goes all the way to Calvary because there where God provided the real sacrifice like I said now if you try to make him some other person so you take this and try to bring down your River Jordan doctrines and Things They said that Jesus was just a man till the River Jordan and then he become God and then God left him and and all that and the other then you don't you don't have God giv his life right then you got so old they're so wonderful in their Revelation but my God can't die when mine dead that I might live that's the difference in the way I believe it and what everybody else believes it seemingly you say what God can't die brother Dale the life went out of that body right that was death right that was God himself providing a sacrifice that was not God providing a son to pay the price it was God coming himself to make a sacrifice now we're quick as I say to accept the fact and we believe on it that he is our savior M but can we believe he's our healer the same way we believe he's our savior have you ever even studied these names I asked you the other day would you listen to even just one tape I ain't no going to ask for no raise of hands but I just wonder how many of you heard that tape you know I ask you just to Simply listen to Jehovah under the seven compound names of Jehovah right but now have you ever just studied these Redemptive names Amen to see whether they apply to you or not right and that's why I keep saying it I want it buried into our head if nothing else maybe get in a heart sometime do we value each one the same or do we try to make it in degrees but see he's our sacrifice he took my place who took my place God took my place amen not a son of God there's no such thing in the Bible as those things God came himself righten that he could taste death your Prophets it we see everybody's got over they're so smart see but brother Dale God can't taste death God is a spirit there's where you're hooked at you just got God as a spirit that's floting how long could we preach on it how long have we preached on it the condescending of God that God himself descended to man he didn't send somebody else he came himself but he provided himself as a sacrifice all right and in doing that then see the word itself Jehovah Gyra God sees the the situation and God gives his own life the lamb was just a natural thing there cuz that wasn't that sacrifice that was made that one that that Abraham made was not the one to cover sin even in the natural that was not the one to cover sin the one to cover sin would have had to been taken to the high priest you would had to taken it up and made a sacrifice that lamb was just exactly what it was for to take the place of Isaac right right it didn't make Abraham righteous he didn't cover Abraham's sin he just saved Isaac's life see because Isaac was not the promised seed right right Jesus Christ was the promised seed so God would have to come himself are your sacrifices no good that's right you see why the my point of trying to we I try to preach to you to get you to think just just think about it man we're not supposed to think we're supposed to get it by Revelation amen but you can't get it by Revelation if your brain don't operate you can't get it by Revelation reading G omin it you get it by the study of God's word amen but you see do we make him what who was that sacrifice I know I was going to go through all of them today oh boy we may take three months on on this but get your mind on that sacrifice you know then that every time a little animal was taken up and killed it was speaking of Calvary yes then the high priest and they begin to offer lamb and you know they begin to do and every that bit of that just got getting stronger and stronger you know but you know after a while God said I'm tired of it you've made my offering a garbage can right that's what he said he said it's become a stink in my nostrils the things he Ed aain for man to do and you know what man was doing it they never quit offering the lamb and it became a stink no no it was the fact of not their sincerity right about what they were doing amen have we got to where we just go to church and claim to believe the message and just you know we're in the message what else do you want brother Dale I'm more worried right now than I have ever been in my life amen I try to keep it under cover and don't let you know it but you know if God don't step on the scene pretty quick folks we got a problem how many of you are over 60 how many is over 70 we are 70 and over now time don't have nothing to do with it ain't worried about that time's not worrying me what's worrying me is you and me because we got to get out of here but it'll take the revealed word to get us out of here right it won't take this sermons of making us feel good and that's good it won't take you know things of like that or things that you know we think makes sense when they don't it's going to take the word of God Amen what kind of a sacrifice do you have my sacrifice was almighty God am no Brother D was a son no my sacrifice was almighty God that was the only way that God could taste death was to enter a human flesh by and mzc couldn't do it mzed could have felt pain mzc could have done this that the other but he couldn't be our sacrifice this one had to come because the word said it would that he would come virgin born and that it would be Emmanuel what kind of sacrifice do you have if he died that I might live then who died the you get into all of that with your mind it is don't try to figure it out just believe it God came down took him 4,000 years because he came the wor the way he said he would come right and he came down to be Jehovah Gyra so the Lord did provide himself to be my sacrifice and yours if you'll accept it what greater could it be well I just can't understand I just I just can't understand because I don't see how God that's where you you're not looking at God correct way see then you get off of that and you get back and you need to go back and start in Genesis and preach one God again all the way down do you believe God died in your place see there's no reason to talking about how the the next one that we could we could be as righteous as he is that's why I moved it around see instead ofing Jehovah gyus and then Jehovah RFI and all the way gen is used that's why I moved it because I wanted it moved out way how can he be Jehovah just can you our righteousness if he wasn't righteous himself right now brother randam said if Jesus wasn't God he said he was the biggest deceiver that ever been right but yet do we still toy in our minds any thought or concept whatsoever of mankind that would make him anything other than God himself well you can't see God I'm glad you thinking but the man that stood here on the shores of Galilee said if you seen me you seen the father am remember the lady that was really good to brother Bram talking you know but brother Brandon that's like a husband and his wife because you're one he said not that kind of one she said pardon he said do you see me she said yes he said do you see my wife she no he said then it's not the same kind cuz Jesus said if you seen me you've seen the father if he wasn't our sacrifice then surely were not even no concept or thought could be made of anything about being righteous right we're found in our sins needing a savior if that was not almighty God that died on Calvary yeah but I just don't understand how he could die how can you die come on how can you die I mean you sit right there and say BL and die now you being silly no I'm not being silly tell the truth let's see you die we'll try pray for you to be raised if you don't we take you an Undertaker well now you ought not be sarcas I'm not sarcastic I'm telling the truth you can't die right I could take a gun and or a knife or something and cut your head slap off of you and I could not they call it killing you that that's all right cuz that's human words but God's the only one that can take your life that's right God was the only one that could die right one man could die for another and plenty of men have done it that told stories of how somebody you know in the militaries and the things and and somebody threw a hand grenade and the guy just jump on that and just blow him all to pieces when he know it was going to kill him and died for other people to save a company or whatever and that's that's great but this man didn't just fall on a hand grenade to try to keep somebody being killed right this man took sin that I'm talking about it he nailed it to the Cross amen he became sin for me he didn't have any sin he became sin for me that I might become as righteous as he is there's no need to talking about righteousness and that goes to show that what the prophet said there in the church age book he said the revelation of it is missing to most people what that we're just as righteous as God is by the new birth amen he said it's missing with that's you I agree with it what do you agree oh some days I read and I'm feeling pretty good I'm doing all right I look at the word and I say you know Lord I'm just as righteous as you are about 30 minutes later I'm in I'm the biggest sinner there is in the world because that's what I'm thinking in my own mind cuz see we got to get it straight but the main thing to get straight is who is our sacrifice if that was a man and that's all he was with just a man that died at Calvary then you and I are lost that's right going to remember this one that dies must be able to not only pay the price right right but he must be able to come back in the person that he died for now I ought to do away with all this about the body of Jesus I'm not against those Brothers I'm against what they preach yeah well they don't agree with it but you know what they're trying it is just it still ain't just a a bunch of people just six and seven and trying to preach good something to make you feel good and and tell you all this that and the other at least these other brothers is trying to preach something right I got more respect for them than I have for the biggest portion of the people of the mess because at least they're trying I don't agree with it it ain't right but they're doing better than the others you understand what I mean yes cuz this thing is not being good and going to church right this thing is you and I going to walk off this Earth one day or we're going by the grave but you see it's what our minds we get in them and what do we think in our human mind our capacities of our mind I was laughing yesterday telling them something thing about it was Brother Ray about think coming back last night you know I I say something here about you know people sleeping and I know that's a problem and I have a problem too but you know what I say like this is you know I say to you say well why not between services today go lay down and take your nap and then you won't have no trouble in the evening service cuz that's what I do whether I'm preaching or not I try to sneak off and get me a little nap you know but brother Dale if I took a nap in the middle of the day I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight I'm mean I know I know I'm mean is right s but the point's there you sat here and sleep do you stay awake at night after sleeping here come on folks amen so don't tell me that you know I can't take a nap in the middle of the day you take a nap at church is that a different something you okay but who is your sacrifice don't worry about who your righteousness is cu you can't understand it that's what we don't understand we want to jump from Jehovah Gyra to jeh Jehovah RFA we don't want to go through the other to get into the situation of understanding what they mean and how their relationship to us Abraham when he said the name of this place is Jehovah Gyra he was saying in relationship to me they was a God that created a lamb because you know the story 25 miles back over the mountains and all up in the hills why didn't the animals eat him up you you heard the message of the prophet he said God created a lamb Jehovah created a lamb to take the place not of Abraham he created a lamb to take the place of Isaac so he says the Lord Jehovah sees Jehovah sees he sees down he realizes there's a need and he comes down and he creates because only God can create so he creates a land but that was only speaking of Jesus Christ see God just didn't come down in the last in their days after you know the prophets and all and create a lamb he came himself he came himself this is not a good luck story or a bedtime story this is the gospel truth if your God didn't die on Calvary then you're not saved right right that's just sensible as can be but you don't understand I know I don't understand brother BR said that's why they come up with this great big God in three persons Blessed Trinity he said just don't you just don't he said I know I don't understand I don't understand how they could be that right but you see Jehovah Gyra doesn't mean that God sent somebody else Jehovah jyra means god stood there before Abraham and spoke that lamb where would have not have been called Jehovah J he spoke that lamb into existence right what about The Real L what about the lamb that takes away the sin of the world what about the one that provided way what about the one who died have you ever thanked God for dying for you have you ever done I mean just thank him for dying for you well you see why that they come up with all these other doctrines and it makes it so sweet my God didn't die oh it just makes it so sweet of a story that's what gets me about all of us you you can talk about Jesus dying on the cross and you can preach to the congregation and all the things and tell all about the what happened and how he was beat and how he was done people just sit there and look at and go sleep would you start talking about brother random and how his wife died and his baby died and people just cry all over the building I'm I'm not throwing off on that I cried too I'm just telling it like it is we put more value our thought emotionalism reaches us quicker of the things brother Bram tells than it does about what Jesus done but who is our Jehovah JRA if it's not God himself then we're left in our sins right who come down in my place God did not another person that's why I said if we don't go to the Jehovah righteousness you know our righteousness why because we can't understand Jehovah listen folks I'll run this on back go on your computer and run into the seven compound names of Jehovah and then go down the line and just keep reading the commentaries and the the things you see Jehovah means that's why it was only used there it wasn't used in Genesis 1 the word God was used in Genesis 1 which means Elohim self-existing Jehovah means like a father with his family and and he's bringing his name down to his family because the family has to have the same name but when it was first brought out it was jvh V I know you use it sometime jvh U and it be different word but just remember one thing there was no vowels in it so they had to add the vowels to make it come out to be Jehovah if you read read the story they have now it's on the internet if you want to go on and read it where that this uh Jewish rabbi was dying and for years before he died he began to preach that the name of God was Jesus I going there very little but when I see something like that it interests me of course it goes back to Jehovah se you know but he was pronouncing his name and saying that was the name of the Messiah to leaving his own son said Daddy got into delusions but he sure did brag on his daddy he said Daddy saw visions and daddy talked to God personally he went along with all that but he couldn't go along with it and him having any connection to understanding the name of the Messiah would be Jesus but you know the old brother could have been broke right into something you know where you can see it see a lot of people don't understand about the Messiah to the Jews and thing you know that there was a 90y old man about 3 or 4 years ago up New York died and they believed he was the Messiah they had a group of them believe that that was the Messiah because they believe some of them believe that he's not coming back act like that that it just be an understanding comes to you of you know the Messiah but you know when things will take place but there's others believe that there will literally be a person stand out there and that'll be the Messiah but you see that's what I told Ruben when I was over there with him Brother Dean and US was out there with him and prayed for him when he had a rice on him he couldn't go to sleep at night I said Ruben you believe the messiah's coming he said yes sir I said we just believe the messiah's already come I said we both believe in the Messiah it's just a Bas as we believe he's already come you believe that he's coming and you telling us all about this one that we believe to be the Messiah he said yeah and you telling me that he existed yes sir I prove he existed said this Messiah told us this Jesus told us to lay hands on the sick and they'd recover you believe in praying don't you yes sir I said you mind if me and Brother Dean and I lay our hands on you he said no I wish you would he got up the next morning he didn't have no rash right see but you say well why didn't he believe it cuz his mind is blackened his heart is darkened he's not born again right that's right he's telling y'all about Jesus but he just doesn't have Jesus in his heart that's right his sacrifice did not become personal to him he still wants to go back and offer the lamb Because he believes he keeps offering the lamb and the and the Rams and the the red heer and everything right that the Messiah come well he's not looking for the Messiah to come and die they don't believe the Messiah is going to come and die no way but you see if the Messiah didn't come and die there is no salvation right what about Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide himself and did provide himself for you and I that we might be saved no need of talking about being how that he is our righteousness or even speaking of righteousness until we understand who died because if it wasn't God we're not righteous it was just a man that died we're not righteous if that was just a man that died you're not not righteous there's no way brother R said it's impossible for one man to die for another well why don't you believe what he says well Brothers don't so makes it so sweet and wonderful okay but is it the truth will brother so and so stand up to the truth come and let's see let not being Circ itic nor hateful or nothing just being truth if I ain't right I want somebody to show me why because my life is at stake right and brother D you just won't listen will you I'm talking to Lula Georgia what's out there is anybody else's business I'm talking to you and me who is your sacrifice I want you to know that I believe and it's surely not one this because it took 4,000 years for him to get here and a lot of Jehovah jyra Jehovah kishu Jehovah arban Jehovah Shalom it took a lot of things being made manifest before he could step out there to be God in human flesh that's right so don't make me a Oneness I'm Oneness in true Oneness yes sir but not to denominational Oneness I believe in one true and living God Amen but oh if I had about two hours or three to preach on it cuz you know how I preach it now I believe it that's why they couldn't understand as we're bringing out the other day they couldn't understand Satan has never been understand how that Michael could step on the scene can't understand that he can't get that comprehended in his mind cuz he don't know where he come from he's standing there talking to the devil and now here goes a Halo of light the great son of the Living God the word of God and begins to say Let There Be you know what he looked like that was theophany you know what he looked like Jesus that stood on the shores of Galilee sir cuz that's who he was I really enjoyed that time the only time they allowed it cuz he wouldn't do it no more there at the The Passion Play when they had that about the creation of the world and they had the same man that played Jesus in the parts that came on and I thought I we said she that every time of course it didn't mean anything probably the 99% it was D but it did to me because dire he was and all at once here come a baby crying and then they showed him it coming up there he was a man same man that ain't Oneness see Oneness can't stand that God just moved over in another form and here stands God still talking to the devil right today he's up there talking to the devil but yet God's in your heart yes they can't understand that and there are all the fullness of the godhead B that dwell in Jesus Christ and the devil's still up here talking Heaven Wasn't emptied right see they don't understand the Son of God Where's God now I thought we were the children of God oh how you want to preach I thought we were the sons and daughters of God well then if we're the Sons and Daughters of God we God made manifest in another form Bri for I can't see there's no need to talk about Jehovah tishu which means he's our righteousness until we see that Jehovah of the old was Jesus of the new and how je Jehovah God dwelt on Earth in him that body standing there dwelt the fullness of the godhe bodily that's why I believe that when that baby was born his soul was the soul of God Amen his Spirit was the spirit of God Amen the body was just a creation right but you can't separate him no more once he created it cuz that's when he become Jehovah with his family like a father that's what Jehovah means like a father with his family that's when he really become that and could stand on this Earth and Proclaim unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins oh but Brother D left what was in him come in him and then then left out of it what kind of a god do you have what kind of a comprehension of God do you have that he just comes into something uses it and goes out of it and don't use it no more what does he do with that that he don't use well brother Dale I'm glad you said that yeah I'm glad you thought it too cuz see brother brandom said when MDC came that God just and spoke a body into existence and stepped into it right he said but then he just and spoke it right back out of existence because we never never see Mel jezdic no more we see Jesus who is your sacrifice is he Jehovah jar then God himself amen came down to give us life it's the only way cuz when we get there I've preached it to you when we get there we're not going to see a Halo of light over here and something over here represent the the dove looking around you know and we going to see Jesus and we going to realize who he was think on these things there's no need to talk about Jehovah T can you our righteous until we see who our savior is because only our savior that can take our place can make us righteous you agree there's no way for us to be righteous that's right somebody's got to take our place will me to take your place won't make you righteous right come on Brothers think on these things he's Jehovah Gyra the Lord has provided a sacrifice and that sacrifice he provided was not just a one lamb all that just spoke of him but it was the one who stepped on this Earth 2,000 years ago that we call Jesus Christ and he could stand there and say I and my father are one that's certainly not Oneness is it but it's certainly not trinitarianism either because he was telling the truth and he can be in every one of us and still be up in heaven today right because he's Jehovah let's stand again what we got 669 is power 669 anybody have a need think of that one that you serve is he your savior after all lifted and we stand upon the so over in the city that the savior is that I can make it you can make it can't you myself I can't make it can you but I know Jehovah Shalom Shar I will call keep on trusting keep are the words that I me strength that I can make it I don't have enough voice so sing it unto it after all and our bir have been lifted and we stand upon the mountain so tall oh look over in that City that theor what does it do me I anybody have a need as we sing that course over again after all this is over and our burdens have been lifted and we stand upon the mountain so tall over in theor do you believe it me faith that I can make amen do you believe it just think about these things think about your savior your sacrifice if it wasn't God we're still lost but then if we take that and just make it and try to get it to understood as a savior and don't understand all of the other calm down Redemptive names then we're not making them all the same that's why we can't understand that we're just as righteous as he is cuz we're still looking at something of ourselves that's right and God is not looking at her anything he's looking at his own self that's where he made the way father we thank you Lord we ask you to just dismiss us that we go Lord eat a natural meal come back together this afternoon father that you'd help us to understand who is our sacrifice who is this Jehovah Gyra the Lord sees and provides we love you father thank you for all things just got each one in Jesus name amen you dismissed this week
