[13:33] got one
[13:36] you that's the only reason coats you
[13:39] know I've often said many times that if
[13:41] I had my own church I would just put my
[13:43] coats on a rack over there number them 1
[13:45] 2 3 4 5 and just come on out in a shirt
[13:49] and a tie and just say I'm wearing
[13:50] number seven over here today y'all just
[13:52] look at that and and then and then you
[13:54] don't have to have to go through that
[13:56] that ritual but that's it amen wow it's
[14:00] it's just it's just different I mean I
[14:02] preached a lot in my life but and a lot
[14:04] of different places but the this far
[14:07] down and meeting y'all for the first
[14:08] time and we we met these two guys when
[14:11] they came out to Kansas brother pingston
[14:13] is our pastor there in witch talk Kansas
[14:16] we uh have just moved out there back in
[14:19] February of this year so so 2011 has
[14:23] been a big change for us as a family we
[14:27] spent the last 21 years years down in
[14:29] Fort Walton Beach Florida prior to that
[14:32] and I found out over the last five or
[14:34] six years that I spent more time in
[14:35] Witchita preaching than I did in Florida
[14:38] so so it just seemed like because of the
[14:41] need that was there and the help that I
[14:43] could be that we went ahead and just
[14:45] relocated our our our dog and our
[14:47] furniture and just took it all out there
[14:49] and now we're Kansas residents for the
[14:51] first time um but it's uh brother
[14:54] Pinkston wanted to got a text from him
[14:56] just 10 minutes ago he wanted to send
[14:58] his greetings all of y'all got to meet
[15:00] him earlier in the year um if I can just
[15:04] be half the preacher he is tonight then
[15:06] then the Lord will be pleased with that
[15:08] I'm sure we enjoy his ministry and amen
[15:10] and we've gotten acquainted with the way
[15:12] you you your guys preach we get a little
[15:15] sample we get a we get bigger doses of
[15:17] brother Wade than we do Brother Sam when
[15:19] he comes out so so we know twice as well
[15:21] how he preaches as much as his dad does
[15:24] because he takes twice as long I may as
[15:26] well just go on and say that I me say
[15:29] Amen to that you know oh is that the way
[15:30] it is here well that's the way it was in
[15:32] Kansas I'm just I'm just surmising that
[15:35] it we got a shoe thrower on the front
[15:37] row here but
[15:40] uh you know Brother Sam come out and he
[15:43] was just done so quickly and then
[15:44] brother Wade was following him up the
[15:46] next week and I just sent word that you
[15:47] don't get to roll over minutes you
[15:50] know the next guy
[15:53] in if you forfeit your Menace the next
[15:55] guy don't get them this ain't AT&T this
[16:00] this is the Church of the Lord so but uh
[16:04] but anyway that it's uh I guess I'll
[16:07] tell you something about me since you
[16:08] don't know me I I came in the message in
[16:12] 1969 I know you're all looking saying
[16:14] wow you don't look that old so go on and
[16:16] get that out of the way you know I well
[16:18] that guy's looking been around a long
[16:20] time but 1969 in Tennessee I'm a
[16:23] Tennessee boy uh our church was in nut
[16:26] Bush Tennessee Brother Ray Miles was the
[16:28] pastor that that got the message started
[16:30] there back in in the late
[16:33] 60s coming through Pentecost a few years
[16:36] prior to that we had a man ministering
[16:39] there his name was um a brother gray
[16:42] Freddy gray he had sat under WV grants
[16:45] Ministry and and through the middle 60s
[16:48] of course I was six and seven and 8
[16:51] years old and you don't remember a lot
[16:53] of things that went on but but he was he
[16:56] we recognized later after he was gone
[16:58] and and the Lord had took him off the
[16:59] scene that that even in those
[17:01] Pentecostal years that he was preaching
[17:04] a lot of things not letting us know that
[17:07] it came from Brother Bram you know y'all
[17:09] ever been around folks like that I
[17:12] mean he was a fine man he had a b gift
[17:15] of his own I remember just just one
[17:18] little instance to to relate to that I
[17:20] remember as a kid he was preaching we
[17:21] were going to have a two we Revival how
[17:23] many remember two week long Revival them
[17:26] them don't happen much anymore but but
[17:28] we were going to have this two week long
[17:30] Revival and all the way leading up to
[17:32] that here I am 7 8 years old all the way
[17:34] up to that he keeps telling us that
[17:35] twins are born in every
[17:38] Revival and I kept hearing he preached
[17:40] that and preached that leading up to
[17:41] this two- we Revival that we were going
[17:43] to have and I I'm looking around as a
[17:45] child as a kid I'm looking for the some
[17:48] pregnant lady that was going to fulfill
[17:50] that you know later on when we came into
[17:53] the message we realized where he got
[17:55] that and as an adult I understood what
[17:57] he was talking about
[17:59] but we had him there he was a fine man
[18:00] of God I remember you know going through
[18:03] the Pentecostal years and sitting under
[18:05] that Ministry and then I was sharing
[18:07] with brother Dale today one day I
[18:09] remember very well he prophesied there
[18:11] was going to be a death in the church
[18:12] and it would shake the church up and
[18:14] great things were coming down the way
[18:16] and it was him 2 weeks later he was
[18:18] killed in a car crash and on his way
[18:20] into town to get the mail one morning
[18:22] and so shortly after that the message
[18:25] came and then we understood maybe the
[18:27] Lord was just Paving the way to get us
[18:29] down but right right but that was 42
[18:32] going on 43 years ago that we came into
[18:34] this word and and I just want to report
[18:37] that the hope of of of what the word
[18:39] came to do is not diminished years later
[18:42] right I have no um that ain't nothing I
[18:46] don't feel like there's anything lacking
[18:48] that that we missed anything that we
[18:50] we've been short changed along the way
[18:52] for us to still be here right Glory
[18:54] because brother random let us know that
[18:56] God's clock is exactly on
[18:59] it doesn't matter how long it may be we
[19:02] a lot of folks spent way too much time
[19:04] figuring out how long it was going to be
[19:06] right we had this fell this past year
[19:09] figuring out you know who was the guy
[19:11] out there in California Mr camping he
[19:13] had it what was the first day sometime
[19:15] back in the in the early summer and then
[19:18] that didn't work out and he moved it up
[19:19] to October and finally after that one
[19:21] failed he said I'm just going to quit
[19:22] trying I'm not going to give you anymore
[19:24] he ought to quit before the first one
[19:26] and then he wouldn't have had all that
[19:27] trouble but
[19:29] but that that's our our history we were
[19:31] born and raised there in the church um
[19:33] the church again starting around around
[19:36] I'm actually a year older than than than
[19:39] brother Wade here just to give you an
[19:40] idea of I know I look way younger than
[19:43] that I mean you know met his brother
[19:45] today and I said did you say it's your
[19:47] brother or your son you know I just just
[19:49] couldn't figure
[19:51] out it's the gray it's the gray but he's
[19:54] putting us up I may find sand in my
[19:56] sheets tonight when I get home I don't
[19:59] know but
[20:01] uh but we we've enjoyed the day of
[20:04] Fellowship we got in this morning uh you
[20:06] like I said you met our pastor and
[20:08] through that and through meeting these
[20:09] brothers here we are to to just share
[20:11] some things in the word with you tonight
[20:14] I trust the Lord
[20:16] helpap yeah we were just having some
[20:18] fellowship today and and I was about
[20:21] probably 1970 I was 10 9 10 years old
[20:26] and we had a man coming from up in East
[20:28] Tennessee named brother Woodby was
[20:29] preaching a Revival right and and he
[20:32] preached this revival and the whole gang
[20:34] of us went out and got water baptized in
[20:36] a cow pasture P that day and he baptized
[20:40] me when I was about 10 years old we
[20:41] never saw him a whole lot after that I
[20:43] never really knew what come of him or
[20:45] where he went but it was brother Woodby
[20:46] that that baptized me at about 10 years
[20:49] old later on in life after you know I
[20:51] came to more recollection our pastor
[20:53] there we were at a camp meeting up in
[20:54] Michigan and he baptized me again as
[20:57] seems to be the case so many times when
[20:59] your conscience wants to be clear but
[21:02] but I still remember very well at about
[21:04] 10 that that he came and I think my mom
[21:06] and some of the elders there the older
[21:08] people in the church and all of us kids
[21:10] we were all just getting baptized that
[21:11] day and and so I still remember that
[21:14] very well it was our brother would be
[21:16] and like I said years went by we never
[21:17] knew what even come of him but it ain't
[21:20] really the man that puts you under the
[21:21] water it's the conscience that's cleared
[21:24] by going under that water right I know
[21:26] you get a you know water B baptism very
[21:28] well but but that was that was about
[21:31] 1970 somewhere in there and I've been
[21:34] privileged in in my short life to to
[21:37] live through all the cycles that this
[21:38] message has had to offer right I mean I
[21:41] know looking at some of y'all you know
[21:43] the message is getting older let me just
[21:45] say that when I first started preaching
[21:47] and I and I did start preaching when I
[21:48] was about 19 years old so 32 years ago
[21:53] that were somewhere in there I started
[21:54] preaching and I've gotten to preach to a
[21:56] lot of churches been in a lot of
[21:57] different meetings and I've lived
[21:59] through all the cycles that we've all
[22:00] went through we went through and we went
[22:03] through all of them we had the dates we
[22:04] had the 77 and then we had the 84 and
[22:08] and we stored up canned goods sometime
[22:10] along the way there I don't know why we
[22:12] were doing that still I can't remember
[22:13] but but it was one of those Cycles we
[22:16] were in you know one of those
[22:17] transitions that the message was going
[22:19] through and and again I just share with
[22:22] you brother R said God's clock is
[22:24] exactly on time right I'm just glad to
[22:27] have lived through those cycles and
[22:28] still be looking for what God is doing
[22:32] and what he's going to do in our lives
[22:34] that's right I've been married 27 years
[22:36] to my wife Sandy and got her out of
[22:37] Canada moved up to Canada to work with a
[22:40] brother out there in Edmonton so she is
[22:42] a
[22:43] Canadian I I toil seven years in Canada
[22:46] and we decided to move back to the state
[22:48] so I just stood up and let him know I
[22:49] said you know lest it be the Jacob
[22:51] scenario I don't I don't want to work
[22:53] seven more for another
[22:56] one
[22:58] that that didn't win me much favor up
[23:02] there you know I I just you know being
[23:05] from tennessy I just like to say things
[23:07] like they are you know I just let them
[23:09] know I'm Southern born and Southern
[23:10] bread when I'm die I'll be Southern dead
[23:12] you know and so the Canadian folks
[23:15] didn't appreciate that very much but
[23:17] here we are back in the south for the
[23:19] last got three children two two grand
[23:22] children and a third one on the way and
[23:24] um they are why we are traveling through
[23:28] at this time we went back down to
[23:29] Florida for Thanksgiving and Christmas
[23:31] and and um my of course it's hard to
[23:34] leave the grandkids behind that's one of
[23:36] the hardest struggles I have to go daily
[23:39] just about and read that scripture where
[23:41] Jesus says unless you leave father
[23:44] mother just to keep me encouraged
[23:46] because it is hard to be away from him
[23:48] that's right the folks in Kansas aren't
[23:51] sure my wife has moved yet or not
[23:53] because she's back down there so much
[23:56] they they think she took up some kind of
[23:57] F residency cuz she gets to go back more
[24:00] than I do but uh but that's our history
[24:03] we we've spent 21 years in Florida we
[24:06] spent about seven years in Canada
[24:08] working with different churches there
[24:10] and and learned to trade I learned to
[24:12] sell cars for a dealership while I was
[24:15] up there I know that hits close to home
[24:16] around here right and so we that's been
[24:19] part of our life I sell life insurance
[24:22] for a living not not asking for any
[24:24] applications to be handed out this
[24:26] weekend or anything a lot of preachers
[24:28] will get up and they'll want to mix
[24:29] their business with their preaching you
[24:31] know and um I'm sure you lived through
[24:34] that cycle too somewhere along the way
[24:37] but uh I trust the Lord will help us
[24:39] tonight I I'm not usually longwinded at
[24:41] all when he said watch night and four
[24:43] hours and all that kind of stuff I was
[24:45] just kind of bewildered by that but I'll
[24:48] do my best when just say you know 4
[24:53] hours I'm just thinking how in the world
[24:55] can
[24:56] you you you know especially
[24:59] because you know a lot of folks really
[25:01] love them quotes where brother R said
[25:03] the preacher ought to get up and preach
[25:04] about 45 minutes how many you know he
[25:06] said that you know yeah oh we love them
[25:08] don't we especially after the guys went
[25:10] a couple hours that's the only quote you
[25:13] can remember when you get home prr said
[25:16] preacher ought to go about 45 minutes
[25:19] but I you know I I learned a lesson I
[25:21] was several years ago I was up in
[25:22] Baltimore Maryland and I was sitting in
[25:24] a meeting and there was a brother there
[25:26] from Trinidad that was preaching I
[25:28] didn't know this man but he he made one
[25:30] and I don't remember a whole lot of what
[25:31] he said except for one observation and
[25:33] he said this he said I know everybody is
[25:35] going to tell you that brother brandom
[25:38] said you a preacher should preach about
[25:40] 45 minutes and his observation was this
[25:43] he says but if I'm preaching and you're
[25:46] receiving and we're all having a good
[25:48] time for about 3 hours and when we get
[25:51] done it seemed like 45
[25:54] minutes he said have we done disservice
[25:57] to what brother brother Bram said you
[25:59] right well he took his whole three
[26:02] hours but his point was good you know
[26:04] brother brandham said about John over
[26:06] there for that 30 minutes of silence you
[26:08] remember what he said in the seals about
[26:10] that he said it seemed like a
[26:13] millennium he says now 30 minutes not be
[26:16] might not be very long if you're having
[26:17] a good time but he said in that suspense
[26:19] between life and death right he said it
[26:22] seemed like a millennium it wasn't a
[26:25] millennium but it seemed like a
[26:26] millennium right so if we go 3 hours and
[26:29] it seems like 45 minutes then we're
[26:32] right on the
[26:35] message you are you good with that now
[26:38] now I'll have to admit I've sat through
[26:40] a lot of 45 minute sermons that seem
[26:42] like 3
[26:46] hours I I've had my share of those in
[26:49] the last 42 years so so if my if my 2
[26:53] hours seems like 4 hours then just don't
[26:56] don't let me know that because
[26:58] because that that that wouldn't work out
[27:00] very good but but I just wanted to share
[27:02] that with you I get to think of that
[27:03] often that if if the Lord will help us
[27:06] amen right like I said you're going to
[27:08] spend the first half hour figuring me
[27:10] out and I'm going to spend the first
[27:12] half hour figuring y'all out and and by
[27:14] the time we get ready to have a good
[27:16] time it'll be time to go home and take
[27:18] communion and go down and have some
[27:19] fellowship but but with the few we've
[27:22] got to meet so far we've we've
[27:23] appreciated the the the warm handshakes
[27:26] and the greetings and and and I trust
[27:28] the Lord will just let us have some
[27:30] fellowship down the way together so but
[27:33] we did choose a very small text I wanted
[27:35] to start with this and and you know
[27:37] because this is just half a verse here
[27:40] you got here I'm challenged to to fill
[27:43] up four hours with a half a verse right
[27:46] isn't that amazing you know you think a
[27:48] man going to preach 4 hours he ought to
[27:49] read a few chapters out of the Bible at
[27:51] least just to fill up space but out of a
[27:52] half a verse right amen I I found this
[27:55] quote and you I know you're going to
[27:56] know all these quotes the brother's
[27:58] going to try to find them on the screen
[28:00] and and it's good if they do that at
[28:02] home this is just what happens in Kansas
[28:05] we got a couple of pretty good computer
[28:06] guys and as I begin to read a quote
[28:08] they'll search it find it and make sure
[28:11] it's the right one or hopefully it's the
[28:12] right one and they'll put it up on the
[28:14] screen now sometimes we get crosswise
[28:16] and and I'm on one and they're on
[28:18] another one and that's going to happen
[28:19] and they do it for brother Jim who talks
[28:21] a lot faster than I do did y'all have
[28:24] trouble keeping up with him I mean was
[28:26] pretty fast
[28:28] but brother random said this about he
[28:30] had read a text in the in the message to
[28:32] the leosan church behold I stand at the
[28:34] door and knock he read just that one
[28:36] verse and and and he he's obviously to
[28:39] me when he he says this he's picking up
[28:41] something from the audience he says and
[28:44] some might say why brother brandham
[28:47] isn't this rather a small text for a
[28:49] group of people this size and for a
[28:52] Convention of this caliber if you just
[28:55] read just a few words and one little
[28:57] verse of scripture yeah I I I think he
[29:00] was picking that up somewhere out there
[29:02] he read one verse and he says some might
[29:06] say I think somebody probably was out
[29:09] there saying that right and he says and
[29:11] some might say why brother brandom isn't
[29:14] this a small text for a group of people
[29:16] this size a Convention of this caliber
[29:19] if you just read just a few words in one
[29:22] little verse of
[29:24] scripture that's not enough verse yeah
[29:28] that's not enough scripture brother
[29:29] brandom for us are are you following the
[29:33] context what I'm seeing in this quote
[29:35] there's somebody out there saying man
[29:37] this is a big
[29:39] convention this is a big we we beat a
[29:42] convention that's going on here in town
[29:44] this week and you're going to come out
[29:46] here and read one little verse of
[29:47] scripture and that's all you got yeah
[29:49] yeah and brother R says but you see it
[29:52] isn't the size of the Scripture it isn't
[29:55] the size of the reading it's what it is
[29:58] that counts that's right oh man is that
[30:03] right it's what it is that counts it
[30:05] ain't the size everybody's hung up on
[30:08] size you looking at me you're thinking
[30:11] that's a big preacher for a little verse
[30:13] of
[30:14] scripture I we grow big in
[30:17] Tennessee it's just what happens you
[30:19] know in another place he said this he
[30:21] went out and a trumpet gives an
[30:23] uncertain sound and he read Corinthians
[30:25] 14:8 if the trumpet gives an uncertain
[30:27] sound who shall prepare himself for
[30:30] battle one verse he says now this would
[30:33] be enough text that we could be
[30:36] preaching two weeks from now on it and
[30:38] yet never touch the edges of it there's
[30:42] something about the word that's inspired
[30:44] you're constantly on that one text you
[30:46] can tie the entire Bible with it that's
[30:49] correct he goes on to say one day a
[30:51] fellow asked me he says how can you take
[30:54] the same text yeah I said oh my you take
[30:57] a context of anything from it I picked
[31:00] up a little three-leaf Clover laying on
[31:02] the ground and I held it up the man
[31:03] sitting here tonight from Tucson we was
[31:06] over in Pasadena California and I said I
[31:09] could take this three leaf clover and
[31:11] preach 25 years on
[31:14] it how it is a life that's in it how the
[31:17] three blades being the trinity in one oh
[31:20] there's just so many things that we
[31:21] could say about it right amen you talk
[31:24] about a man that can find some
[31:26] inspiration right
[31:27] right that's a gift that I don't have I
[31:30] could not preach 25 years on a little
[31:33] three leaf clover that I pick up out of
[31:35] the ground right but he got a few hours
[31:38] out of a cigarette carton in the woods
[31:41] come on that's
[31:43] inspiration it's when God inspires the
[31:46] word it ain't the
[31:48] size it ain't the size it ain't the size
[31:51] it's just that word will go out and
[31:53] it'll grow this is what brother Brandon
[31:55] is talking about sure amen he says how
[31:58] about a scripture it's God's word it's
[32:00] Eternal it has no end it just keeps
[32:03] going on and on and on it's a refuge to
[32:06] us and now tonight I want to speak on a
[32:09] trumpet gives an uncertain sound so one
[32:11] little verse right I could take this
[32:14] three leaf clover preach 25 years on it
[32:17] you guys figure that one out and meet me
[32:19] outside after and let me know right
[32:21] that's quite a man that believes that
[32:23] the word can Quicken to you and you know
[32:27] brother Brandon's whole message it
[32:28] quickened out of a lot of different
[32:30] areas didn't it I mean come on yeah come
[32:33] on he took his daily living he took his
[32:36] daily life the things that happened
[32:38] around him the events that surrounded in
[32:41] life whether it was a gun blowing up in
[32:42] his face or or or the little things that
[32:45] happened in his life and he said things
[32:48] about those that we just can't say right
[32:50] right you know it's it's just a
[32:53] wonderful thing just a wonderful thing
[32:56] so tonight we are going going to look I
[32:57] got a very short title for this sermon
[33:00] tonight we're just going to call it
[33:02] hungry am with a big question mark
[33:04] hungry blessed are they that do hunger
[33:07] and thirst after righteousness now I
[33:10] want you to notice how this is the best
[33:12] explanation from the message it's out of
[33:14] the Revelation chapter 4 Series 1961 it
[33:18] was actually preached on New Year's Day
[33:20] in
[33:21] 1961 and brother brandom is going to
[33:24] explain this verse in a way that I'd
[33:25] never heard it explained before i' heard
[33:27] this over the 40 something years
[33:29] preached a lot of ways but when I seen
[33:31] this I could see see what the word was
[33:34] written for Jesus said blessed are they
[33:36] for they sh shall be filled now listen
[33:39] to what brother brand said blessed are
[33:41] they to even thirst exactly whether
[33:44] you've got it or not amen is the
[33:48] blessing in the filling or is the
[33:50] blessing in the
[33:51] Thirsty all right cuz we always run past
[33:54] that first half and we go to they shall
[33:56] be f they shall be filled they shall be
[33:58] filled you get a man preaching on a Holy
[34:00] Ghost and that's all he wants to talk
[34:01] about they shall be filled we get people
[34:04] in this message standing up in the pull
[34:06] pit calling out people's names telling
[34:07] them they're filled well I don't know
[34:09] how he knows that right there is a
[34:11] blessing to being filled but there's no
[34:13] man that can stand here and say you got
[34:15] it and you got it and you got it amen
[34:17] the Holy Ghost is a is a tremendous
[34:19] entity in our lives and you know what
[34:21] the only person that's going to know you
[34:22] got it is you there ain't no man can
[34:25] tell you you got it right because if
[34:28] that's the way you know you got it
[34:29] another man's going to come along and
[34:30] tell you you don't have it and you might
[34:32] just believe him as well that's right
[34:34] but we always go past the first part and
[34:36] they shall be filled and we just rejoice
[34:38] and we're happy and that is the answer
[34:41] to the first part but the first part is
[34:44] blessed are they to even thirst whether
[34:46] you've got it or not amen how many wants
[34:49] more of God brother random ask all right
[34:51] well the reason that you want more of
[34:54] God you're blessed just to be that right
[34:57] just a wanted if you haven't got it
[34:59] you're still blessed absolutely yes may
[35:03] I say that again if you haven't got it
[35:05] you're still blessed blessed are they
[35:07] that do hunger and thirst you're blessed
[35:10] just to hunger and thirst because you
[35:13] want it you're blessed cuz there's many
[35:15] people don't want it right exactly
[35:18] doesn't that re-clarify that whole
[35:20] scripture to you doesn't that mean
[35:22] something out of the word that I had
[35:23] never seen before because we always run
[35:26] past to the filling they shall be filled
[35:28] we're only and when we get filled it is
[35:30] a blessing right amen but the real
[35:33] blessing was even wanting to be filled a
[35:36] desire to be filled oh my I love the way
[35:39] this this word opens up to us and you
[35:41] can see those things that's
[35:43] right blessed are they that even thirst
[35:46] whether you've got it or not amen
[35:48] exactly whether you've got it or not oh
[35:51] man now let's break it on down we got to
[35:53] just stop now and think about church we
[35:54] got to think about Services we got to
[35:56] think about coming to church well man I
[35:58] just went out to church and it was so
[36:00] dry and it was long and and it was
[36:02] boring I just didn't seem to get
[36:03] anything but there was something in you
[36:05] that Drew you here so though you went
[36:08] home in your own mind and in your own
[36:10] thoughts thinking maybe you didn't get
[36:12] anything or it wasn't inspirational
[36:14] enough you know us preachers we're a
[36:16] funny Bunch oh yeah some of us are loud
[36:19] some of us are quiet some are long some
[36:21] are short some are humorous some are
[36:24] very dry right I don't know which way
[36:26] you like it yeah and and sometimes the
[36:30] way the the the ministry puts the word
[36:32] together it's just not to your liking
[36:35] right it's not the way you like it and
[36:37] we're going to get into this in a little
[36:38] while the way the word is coming it's
[36:40] just I like it more I wish he was more
[36:43] like brother so and so over here well if
[36:46] I tried to be that man I would be such a
[36:49] a mockery of what he is and such a
[36:52] failure but the thing about the word is
[36:55] it's the word isn't inspired it's not
[36:57] the way it's brought you might go home
[37:00] thinking you got nothing and you'll find
[37:02] out in a few days when a need arises in
[37:04] your life that that word will come right
[37:06] back around to you again and it'll
[37:09] minister to you in a way that you never
[37:11] imagined it could be possible so let's
[37:13] just remember as we get into this text
[37:15] tonight that the blessing is to thirst
[37:18] and to look for it the blessed are they
[37:20] that hunger and thirst they shall be
[37:23] filled that's the wonderful part right
[37:25] but the true blessing is to have a
[37:27] hunger am and a thirst for the word
[37:30] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[37:31] that's our text which they shall be
[37:34] filled amen I believe it with all my
[37:37] heart amen there's a little text a quote
[37:40] I want them to bring up for us if they
[37:41] will it's out of the message let your
[37:44] light so shine before men in
[37:46] 1961 and this is where we're going to
[37:48] actually draw our text out of you may
[37:50] remember this very well and if you just
[37:52] if you know it by heart you just just
[37:54] bear with me because I just I just
[37:56] rejoicing looking at this stuff right
[37:59] like I saying about brother brandom
[38:00] there's there's just some things that
[38:03] that that that he says that we just
[38:04] can't say as well right just some of his
[38:09] ways of look you know there's some
[38:10] things you say that we know already I
[38:12] mean you know yall ever run into those
[38:14] you're reading along or you're listening
[38:15] to a tape and and here's one for you you
[38:18] want one you want one of those you know
[38:20] how many believe there are things that
[38:22] brother brandom says I don't want to get
[38:24] all into the infallibility and every
[38:26] word being the being thus sayith the
[38:28] Lord I'm not you know this is like our
[38:30] first date I'm not going to bring a
[38:31] whole lot of Doctrine out on you just
[38:33] make you wonder what I'm you know you
[38:36] you remember those first dates you girls
[38:38] ever go out with a guy on the first date
[38:39] and you g just gave you way more
[38:41] information than you wanted you know my
[38:44] Paul he just got out of prison the other
[38:45] day well that's more than you want to
[38:47] know on the first day you know yeah I
[38:49] mean you know yeah hold on here well my
[38:53] grandpa when he Clos that still down
[38:55] well
[38:57] that's a lot of information for the
[38:58] first dat so this is our first date if I
[39:00] if I don't just jump into a whole lot of
[39:02] Doctrine if yall just bear with us but
[39:05] but here's one of those things that
[39:06] brother brandom says and and when he
[39:08] says it it just it it clicks in your
[39:11] heart it's the truth but when you set
[39:13] stop and step back and think well I knew
[39:15] that already you know I mean here's the
[39:17] quote it's out of the communion message
[39:20] 1962 brother Brandon says now our bodies
[39:23] need food and drink each day to survive
[39:26] right M everybody saying praise the Lord
[39:28] thank you brother BR well you know that
[39:31] before you ever heard about
[39:33] brother but it's just nice the way he
[39:35] says it isn't it right because he's
[39:37] going to tell us something about that
[39:39] craving of the Natural Body now our
[39:41] bodies need food and drink each day to
[39:43] survive our physical body if we don't
[39:46] take food each day and drink then our
[39:48] body weakens right how many he says
[39:51] praise the Lord I needed Malachi 4 to
[39:53] tell me that right you know that growing
[39:56] up
[39:57] exactly that's why you showed up at the
[39:58] supper table every night and said man
[40:00] I'm feeling weak need some food right
[40:04] there's something in me I am built to
[40:06] eat right right and brother brandom says
[40:10] if we don't take in that food and drink
[40:12] every day then our bodies weakens
[40:14] there's something in us that we must
[40:16] have food right somebody say praise the
[40:19] Lord that's a deep
[40:20] Revelation that ain't no deep Revelation
[40:22] at all you grow up you you got to came
[40:25] into this world crime want something to
[40:27] eat first thing out of you're thinking
[40:29] of when you get here W what's wrong he
[40:31] wants something to eat he don't know how
[40:34] to say it yeah but it's built in you
[40:37] there's a desire there's a hunger that
[40:39] comes and we're built to eat right some
[40:43] of us do a better job of it than others
[40:45] isn't that right brother way I didn't
[40:47] get like this eating bad groceries I
[40:49] want you to know that this is this is
[40:51] from good food I want you to know my
[40:53] wife is a tremendous cook and look what
[40:55] happened amen honestly I was this way
[40:58] before she found me but she didn't help
[40:59] the program any once I did get
[41:02] married but the these are you know I
[41:04] love the message brother man is just a
[41:06] preacher he's just telling us things we
[41:08] already know there's something in us
[41:10] that we must have food one day's food
[41:12] will not last for the next day you've
[41:14] got to have food each day to strengthen
[41:16] your mortal being he says you can live
[41:19] over but you're weaker and the second
[41:21] day you're still weaker and the third
[41:24] day you're getting tremendous weak
[41:26] well that's I mean are you with me we
[41:29] know that go three days without it don't
[41:31] take me 3
[41:32] days I'm tremendous week between
[41:35] breakfast and lunch sometimes you know
[41:37] that's the only thing I faulted brother
[41:38] brandom on that Doctrine with right
[41:42] there man come in just had a big old
[41:45] breakfast honey I'm just tremendous week
[41:47] you know she'll come back and read me
[41:49] this quote no brother said it takes
[41:51] three days to get like
[41:52] that not the first day there you go
[41:57] but you know what he's saying you don't
[41:58] eat you're going to get weak he said
[41:59] well that's what many times that we do
[42:01] in the spiritual realm right you see
[42:04] each day we've got to commune with
[42:06] Christ we've got to talk to him each day
[42:08] we've got to settle it with him each day
[42:11] Paul said I die each day see each day I
[42:14] die yet I live not me but Christ lives
[42:16] in me so if your physical body needs
[42:18] food each day and drink each day to
[42:20] survive your spiritual body needs
[42:23] spiritual food and communion with the
[42:25] Lord each day to
[42:27] survive Jesus said man will not live by
[42:29] bread alone but by every word that
[42:30] proceedeth out of the mouth of God so
[42:32] each day we've got to study the Bible
[42:35] it's a good New Year's message ain't it
[42:37] let's think about 2012 what if we
[42:39] remember this quote every day of 2012
[42:42] amen here it is again each day we've got
[42:45] to study the
[42:47] Bible why don't you say that with me
[42:49] each day we've got to study the
[42:53] Bible brother brand says some people
[42:55] doesn't study at all some picks it up
[42:58] every two or three times a year but I
[43:01] want you to notice the next part of this
[43:03] quote but a real real
[43:06] believer not a Believer but a real real
[43:09] believer right that's really spiritually
[43:12] built up he reads his Bible every day
[43:14] and talks to the Lord amen that's right
[43:17] amen glory what kind of a Believer reads
[43:19] it every day and talks to the Lord every
[43:21] day a real real believer amen how many
[43:25] know there are believers amen and
[43:28] there's real Believers and then there's
[43:30] a real real believer amen and what does
[43:33] that real real believer do he reads his
[43:36] Bible every day and he talks to the Lord
[43:39] every day brother brandom said he has to
[43:42] right right why does he have to because
[43:44] if you go without it you'll become weak
[43:47] and if you go two days without it you're
[43:49] weaker still and if you go three days
[43:51] without it you are tremendously weak
[43:53] right right that's why oh man we we can
[43:57] get in trouble about talking about
[43:58] people listening to tapes at home yeah
[44:01] but that's why you ain't going to get
[44:03] everything you need between Sunday and
[44:05] Wednesday right Sunday and Wednesday
[44:07] ain't enough to change these bodies my
[44:10] dear brothers and sisters exactly I
[44:12] appreciate the ministry you have here I
[44:14] know you have some tremendous Services I
[44:16] know you have the two on Sunday we only
[44:18] have one you got two times on Sunday one
[44:20] on Wednesday but so many people have
[44:23] gotten to where church is like a gas
[44:25] station it's like a up stuff we we just
[44:28] we just barely get in on the opening
[44:29] bell yeah you know I mean you know
[44:32] brother R said get there 30 minutes
[44:34] early how many remember that quote
[44:35] that's right we read it too fast a lot
[44:37] of people said he thought he said 3
[44:39] minutes early but he said 30 minutes
[44:41] early but we'll slide right in W to get
[44:44] refilled recharged charge our batteries
[44:46] on Wednesday so we can make it through
[44:48] till Sunday yeah you know what brother
[44:50] Brown said about your Perfection he said
[44:53] our Perfection comes between us and God
[44:55] Alone
[44:56] that church is just for
[44:58] Fellowship don't you see brothers and
[45:00] sisters as we get closer to him there
[45:02] ought to be such a hunger coming out of
[45:04] us to where we need that word
[45:07] constantly after 3 days you will be
[45:09] tremendous weak if you ain't picked up
[45:11] your Bible or or heard a tape or read a
[45:14] quote or done something to feed your
[45:16] spiritual Soul you will be tremendously
[45:19] weak on that third day maybe that's why
[45:21] all them folks just fall down in the
[45:23] benches on Wednesday and sleep I don't
[45:25] know yeah maybe because they've gotten
[45:27] tremendous weak because they can't
[45:29] remember where they laid down their
[45:30] Bible when they brought it home on
[45:33] Sunday come on I I'm sorry I I see it
[45:36] everywhere I go I see it in my own
[45:38] children I watch it the the what did
[45:40] Brother Rand us word he said we're
[45:42] getting
[45:43] dilatory remember that word dilatory
[45:45] what what's happening to us which it is
[45:47] common anymore sure the message is
[45:50] common you can't be in it 40 years and
[45:52] it not become somewhat common but
[45:54] there's something in that hungry in and
[45:56] thirsting that you're coming back
[45:57] looking for God to feed you it draws you
[46:01] here don't put in the effort to get
[46:03] dressed up put together cleaned up and
[46:05] then come and sleep through
[46:07] service if you're going to sleep sleep
[46:09] at home is that what Paul said if you're
[46:11] going to eat eat at home sleep sleep at
[46:14] home don't come to the house of God you
[46:17] never made all the effort to get here
[46:19] wake
[46:20] up man there's nothing worse than
[46:23] sleeping you know if you if you ever get
[46:26] over there under that juniper tree with
[46:27] Elijah he's he's sitting there sleeping
[46:29] you know what an angel came along and
[46:30] woke him
[46:32] up sure we might preach on that a little
[46:34] bit tomorrow amen an angel came along
[46:36] and woke him up you know what Elijah's
[46:39] reaction was he went back to sleep
[46:42] again you know I'm not unch
[46:44] christianizing it happened to Elijah for
[46:48] and angel had to come kick him in the
[46:49] ribs again wake up Elijah you got a big
[46:51] journey ahead of you it's more you need
[46:54] these biddles again so ate some more and
[46:56] probably went on back to sleep again but
[46:59] let's not do like Elijah rise above that
[47:02] if you're going to get up and put your
[47:04] church clothes on to come to church be
[47:06] at church don't be out on the job don't
[47:09] be out doing your occupation be at
[47:12] church do your best whatever you can do
[47:15] to to rise up and and take hold of what
[47:18] God is doing at the moment I believe
[47:21] what our brother said I believe the the
[47:23] the the word is here whatever vessel
[47:26] that's coming through whatever form it's
[47:27] coming through it is to encourage us
[47:30] it's to to build us up it's to lift us
[47:32] up and have a home life have a home life
[47:35] that is in love with this word have a
[47:37] home life that is in love with this
[47:39] message that you know I ask people
[47:42] sometimes can you remember the last time
[47:43] you put on a tape right and and you know
[47:45] you begin to see them then they're
[47:47] ducking you know and then they're hiding
[47:48] out and then why be ask me that well I
[47:50] should ask you that you need to be asked
[47:53] on a regular basis when is the last time
[47:54] you read a quote
[47:56] when's the last time you picked up your
[47:58] Bible and read it this is what brother
[48:00] random is telling us if you don't
[48:02] continually
[48:04] feed then you are going to be tremendous
[48:06] week tremendous we Lord help us to fall
[48:09] in love with this word no matter how
[48:11] long the journey gets right just help us
[48:14] fall in love with this word more than we
[48:16] ever have been
[48:17] before Lord all right back to back to
[48:20] our text now this is where I drew our
[48:21] thought from tonight brother br's going
[48:23] to relate a little story I have to use
[48:24] these reading glasses cuz of being in
[48:27] the message so long and having a few
[48:29] birthdays behind me now that's right
[48:32] amen at least I bring mine with me your
[48:34] guys leave them at home all the time
[48:35] both of them had glasses troubles out in
[48:38] Kansas I he did I think the other time
[48:41] he did I couldn't get my contacts in
[48:43] couldn't get his contacts in so probably
[48:45] from staying up fellowshipping too late
[48:47] with brother Scher there you know and
[48:48] then eyes was all swelled
[48:52] up all right this follow this quote with
[48:55] me this isn't let your light so shine
[48:57] before men and I know the brothers will
[48:59] find this easy enough he brother brand
[49:00] begins this little
[49:02] narrative he said some time ago I was
[49:05] going down a road I'll give him time to
[49:07] find that and then you can follow the
[49:08] quote with me on the screen because it
[49:11] it just blessed me to look at this uh I
[49:13] just want you to follow some time ago I
[49:15] was going down a road I was driving
[49:17] along at a pretty rapid speed and
[49:20] watching as I usually do by myself
[49:22] driving he said it's a lonesome drive
[49:24] when you're driving by yourself
[49:26] I can say Amen to that amen right of
[49:28] course now we got
[49:30] GPS there always a woman on there
[49:32] screaming at you ain't it and us men
[49:34] will go out and pay $80 or $100 for a
[49:37] GPS just to have another woman in our
[49:39] life
[49:42] Naggy what's wrong with us aren't we
[49:45] glutton for a punishment enough already
[49:47] to have one woman in the car telling you
[49:49] how to drive we'll go out and buy a GPS
[49:52] just so another woman can tell us how to
[49:53] drive yeah I wish sure mine the other
[49:56] day said turn left
[49:58] dummy I went back and double checked it
[50:01] I didn't know why she got so personal
[50:02] like that but but we'll do that us guys
[50:05] we we'll just complain my I wish my wife
[50:07] would quit helping me drive I wish she'd
[50:09] quit telling me where to go begging me
[50:11] to stop and ask directions we just ain't
[50:13] going to do that are we no right come on
[50:15] we can't
[50:17] because because we're the president of
[50:19] the He Man Woman hater club we ain't
[50:21] about we ain't about to stop ask no
[50:24] directions just cuz our wife wants us to
[50:27] we might be 100 miles off course before
[50:29] we before we give up but even after all
[50:33] of that we'll still go out and spend
[50:34] $100 for a GPS right I get so tired of
[50:38] mine sometimes I'll just make her
[50:39] Chinese so I just hear talking in the
[50:41] background ching chong ching chong and
[50:44] then I can just do what I want to do
[50:45] anyway you know just that's the
[50:47] beautiful thing about those
[50:49] machines but brother man I said it's a
[50:51] lonesome drive when you're driving by
[50:52] yourself he he says you can't turn the
[50:54] radio on unless there's some of these
[50:56] family networks where you can get
[50:57] religious music because it's all things
[51:00] that would take the very Spirit out of
[51:01] you I know you agree with that because
[51:04] you sure can't turn the radio he says
[51:06] wherever I go I've gotten a little old I
[51:08] I carry a little pad of paper now now
[51:10] here's a man that wants to remember what
[51:12] God's saying to him wherever I go I got
[51:14] a little old carry a little W of paper
[51:16] when the Lord reveals something to me I
[51:18] just jot it down I've even wrote on my
[51:21] gun stock in the woods with a bullet and
[51:23] things like that just to get a thought
[51:25] that is presented to me right take a
[51:27] piece of tag out of my clothes or
[51:29] something and write on it something
[51:31] another to keep the message in my
[51:34] mind see that's not a man that just lays
[51:36] his Bible down on Sunday and picks it up
[51:38] again to go to church on Wednesday this
[51:40] is a man that when God tells me
[51:42] something I'm going to write it down I
[51:46] want to remember it exen you know that
[51:48] was what was the whole problem with this
[51:50] Pentecostal movement with all the
[51:52] tongues and the interpretation and that
[51:54] went on in the time yeah we had service
[51:57] last night and God just spoke to us so
[51:59] wonderfully and and you never got to the
[52:02] preaching but but the Lord came down we
[52:04] had tongues and interpretation and
[52:07] prophecy and they're just talking about
[52:08] what a wonderful time they had and then
[52:10] he ask well what did the Lord say right
[52:12] yeah I just can't right remember but it
[52:14] was good yeah oh yeah well if the Lord
[52:17] tells you something you want to remember
[52:19] it you want to write it down brother
[52:23] said I've carved my my thought in the
[52:26] stock of my gun now I don't know how he
[52:29] went and repr preached that I don't know
[52:30] if he brought the gun up there with him
[52:31] so he can see it's carving that's just
[52:33] wanting to remember it ain't it right I
[52:35] ain't never done that that's that's
[52:37] getting on far down the way there tear a
[52:38] tag out of my clothes now I've done a
[52:41] few McDonald's napkins I don't know if
[52:42] that's spiritual to y'all or not but
[52:44] I've been riding in the car many times
[52:46] you grab out a McDonald's napkin and
[52:48] write something down but all right sure
[52:51] just something here's the point
[52:53] something another to keep the message
[52:55] message in my mind right Lord let your
[52:58] word ever be before me GL when God
[53:01] speaks remember what he said but he he's
[53:03] just relating this this little as I
[53:05] drove down along this road I noticed a
[53:08] great big beautiful signboard and
[53:10] usually you know they have a lot of
[53:12] things plastered on these signboards but
[53:15] I never noticed such things on this
[53:16] certain signboard usually they have
[53:18] pictures of hash dressed women or
[53:20] something or another advertising a
[53:22] certain brand of cigarettes or whiskey
[53:24] or beer or something on the great
[53:27] shining signboards but to my surprise at
[53:29] my first glance it attracted my
[53:32] attention because it wasn't all smutted
[53:34] up with something another the smut
[53:36] wasn't on it and I gazed back to see it
[53:38] was a beautiful board and sitting in a
[53:41] correct place just where when you turn
[53:43] this corner you can't help from seeing
[53:46] the sign and to my surprise it had one
[53:49] word it had one word wrote across it
[53:53] right hungry y hungry now we're about to
[53:56] get a message off of a billboard now
[53:58] right all right he might he might have
[54:01] stopped and wrote this on some I don't
[54:03] know but he said that's all it said
[54:04] hungry just hungry that's all there was
[54:08] and then I noticed little bitty letters
[54:09] down at the bottom of the board said 3
[54:11] miles
[54:12] ahead yeah hungry 3 miles ahead yeah MH
[54:16] now we're about to get a message about
[54:18] this hungry y 3 mil ahead well are in
[54:23] the study about that he said usually
[54:26] and I know y'all will believe this
[54:27] usually if they got a restaurant ahead
[54:29] they're trying to out sell the other
[54:31] fell the picture of big old sizzling
[54:33] steaks and so forth and when you go in
[54:36] you usually don't find anything like
[54:38] they
[54:39] advertised it's just an advertisement
[54:42] how many ever run into that you go in a
[54:45] restaurant and you're looking at the
[54:46] menu you tell you where I want that
[54:47] hamburger right there that's the one I
[54:50] want big old man the the juice is
[54:52] gushing out of it and it's this thick
[54:54] and he brings you back a little old
[54:55] dried up piece of beef you can't hardly
[54:57] find under the bun right I actually
[55:00] called a guy back one time and said what
[55:01] happened between this picture in your
[55:03] cook in the kitchen yeah did you
[55:05] miscommunicate what I wanted because
[55:08] this is not this is not what I saw right
[55:12] and this is what's brother B saying they
[55:14] usually you don't find anything like
[55:16] they advertise because it's just an
[55:18] advertisement but this seemed to have a
[55:20] different approach and we know that the
[55:22] day that we're living in it pays to
[55:24] advertise we found find out that these
[55:26] people who are making big progress in
[55:28] business are great men of advertisement
[55:31] they put it on television they smear it
[55:33] on boards everywhere they can to
[55:35] advertise their products smoke this one
[55:38] not a coughin a carload guess that must
[55:41] have been a slogan how many know that to
[55:42] be alive from your years of smoking yeah
[55:45] smoke this one not a cough and a carload
[55:47] the the thinking man's filter some other
[55:50] man's tip he's I think he's looking back
[55:52] to that package he found something like
[55:54] that
[55:56] Li Lively longer with their beers and
[55:58] all this stuff like that it's
[56:00] advertisement they write off a lot of
[56:02] their income tax just for advertisement
[56:04] and it certainly pays
[56:06] off and he says so if it pays off for
[56:09] that I begin to think then why won't
[56:11] Christianity pay off if it's advertised
[56:14] right oh what a simple thought huh right
[56:17] amen what a simple thought
[56:19] right if that works for them what if God
[56:23] begins to advertise the real true
[56:26] message right right on a
[56:28] billboard what is advertising you got to
[56:31] have something that's a little different
[56:33] from what the rest of them's got y or if
[56:35] it's just so common like the things of
[56:37] the world it'll never attract the
[56:39] attention of the people now a man if a
[56:42] man would have been looking for an
[56:44] automobile he would have went on past
[56:45] that sign but if he had have been hungry
[56:48] he' have been looking for that sign so I
[56:50] believe that the Christian is God's
[56:52] billboard I believe that each one of us
[56:54] is God's billboard and we don't have to
[56:56] do so much of carrying on about what we
[56:59] do just simply live such a life that
[57:02] will make the people hungry to be like
[57:05] you oh what a message what a New Year's
[57:08] Eve message let 202 be the kind of a
[57:12] year that I can live such a life not a
[57:15] bunch of carrying on right brother I
[57:18] said we don't need to do a lot of
[57:19] carrying on to get the message across he
[57:20] says just live such a life that it'll
[57:23] make people hungry
[57:25] amen you are the salt of the earth what
[57:28] does salt do it makes you thirsty it
[57:30] makes you longing for that I noticed on
[57:32] this Builder board it didn't claim
[57:34] anything it just ask a question if
[57:37] you're hungry right and you cannot sell
[57:40] anybody anything to eat unless they are
[57:42] hungry right right blessed are they that
[57:45] hunger and thirst here's our message
[57:48] from brother brandom are you hungry
[57:50] right going into the new year that's
[57:52] what you have to ask yourself now you
[57:54] know being being hungry is a paradox let
[57:56] me let me show you the Paradox in the
[57:58] scripture Jesus said If any man shall
[58:00] come to me he shall never thirst again
[58:03] oh man how you going to put them two
[58:04] together blessed is you that hunger and
[58:07] thirst after righteous for they shall be
[58:08] filled but if you the man that drinks
[58:11] from this well he'll never thirst
[58:13] again so you got to decide which way is
[58:16] it are you thirsty or not thirsty
[58:19] there's a paradox in that you understand
[58:21] a paradox we got a lot of messages on a
[58:23] paradox it appears to be one thing but
[58:25] it's not exactly that right because that
[58:28] verse about never hunger again a man
[58:32] that eats the of My Flesh and drinks my
[58:34] blood they'll never thirst they'll never
[58:36] be hungry again but yet Jesus said
[58:38] there's a blessing to be hungry and
[58:40] thirsty could it be that in your hunger
[58:43] the satisfaction is automatically going
[58:45] to follow up because of the require of
[58:48] that hunger and because of the Chet that
[58:51] thirst think on that Paradox I don't
[58:53] have all the answers for that one but
[58:55] I'll let brother Wade explain that to
[58:56] you one of these others
[58:58] days would you do that the Paradox the
[59:02] Paradox where are those verses at let's
[59:04] read those two verses it won't hurt us
[59:06] John
[59:07] 6:35 I want you to see that it's
[59:10] something to think on it's something to
[59:12] to ponder you look at what Jesus said in
[59:14] John chapter
[59:15] 6 John
[59:18] 6:35 verse 34 then they said Lord
[59:21] Evermore give us this bread Jesus said
[59:23] unto them I am the bread of life he that
[59:24] come to me shall never hunger mhm yeah
[59:27] there it is you come to me and you'll
[59:29] never hunger y right he that believeth
[59:31] on me shall never
[59:34] thirst how that's what we want right
[59:37] right sure that's what we want right and
[59:39] we also want the blessing of being
[59:41] hungry and thirsty right yeah there's
[59:43] another verse John 4:14 go to that one
[59:46] John 6 is the hungry part John 4 is the
[59:49] the Thirsty part John
[59:52] 4:14 but whosoever drink the water that
[59:55] I shall give him exactly shall never
[59:58] thirst right amen but the water that I
[1:00:00] shall give him shall be in him a well of
[1:00:02] water springing up into everlasting life
[1:00:05] right can you see the Paradox the
[1:00:08] Paradox is this there is a hunger and a
[1:00:11] thirst but God seeing that hunger and
[1:00:14] thirst that's within you he provides and
[1:00:17] sees you as if you are already filled
[1:00:20] right right amen Jesus stood there in a
[1:00:23] midst of a green field one day and he
[1:00:24] said look around you behold the fields
[1:00:26] are white Under Harvest and the laborers
[1:00:29] are few right he was standing there in
[1:00:32] the middle of a green Wheat Field
[1:00:33] telling him that the Harvest was already
[1:00:35] right the fields are white Under The
[1:00:37] Harvest because he wasn't looking at the
[1:00:39] current condition he was looking at the
[1:00:41] end result of that that's right and
[1:00:44] that's the Paradox of this you will
[1:00:46] never thirst you will never be hungry
[1:00:48] because I see you as a filled and
[1:00:51] satisfied and you I promise you brothers
[1:00:53] and sisters you cannot come to the any
[1:00:55] Services you cannot come to your Sunday
[1:00:57] and your Wednesdays with a desire to be
[1:01:00] fed that God will let you walk away this
[1:01:02] that's right in spite of the man that's
[1:01:04] bringing the word in spite of our
[1:01:06] failures in spite of our human
[1:01:09] Tendencies if you have a hungering and a
[1:01:11] thirsting God will see you is already
[1:01:14] because that's the Paradox of the word
[1:01:16] oh I love that I love it that's what
[1:01:18] this word came to do what did Brother R
[1:01:21] say as she nears him when he picked up
[1:01:24] his pen wrot what did he say as she
[1:01:26] nears him she becomes so much like him
[1:01:29] she is in his very image amen he sees
[1:01:32] her from a far off he sees her as she is
[1:01:34] approaching but as she nears him she
[1:01:37] becomes in his likeness and in his oh
[1:01:40] what is it's just the drawing power of
[1:01:42] the word that's all it is brothers and
[1:01:44] sisters that's right brother amen hungry
[1:01:47] hungry that's all we're talking about
[1:01:48] tonight hungry are you hungry and
[1:01:50] thirsty for the things of God you don't
[1:01:52] have to go home short Chang that guy
[1:01:54] said we we need to always be searching
[1:01:56] for something oh my
[1:01:59] goodness I may as well be a real
[1:02:01] Evangelistic and just stop and talk
[1:02:03] about those that are always searching
[1:02:05] for something always wanting they're the
[1:02:08] give me more people yeah you ever have
[1:02:10] those around in your church you got to
[1:02:11] give me more yeah well well brother I'm
[1:02:14] giving you all the words that the Lord's
[1:02:15] showing me but you got to give me more
[1:02:17] because I was on the internet the other
[1:02:19] day and I was looking at what that guy
[1:02:20] was preaching he seemed to have more
[1:02:22] than you did oh my have you been there
[1:02:24] yeah with that old mind let me know
[1:02:26] y'all been there yes I want you to give
[1:02:28] me more I want you I want you to do it
[1:02:30] like he does it yeah I want you to I
[1:02:32] want you to say things like he says them
[1:02:35] and they're always striving and
[1:02:38] searching that's not a hunger that's a
[1:02:41] lust yeah you know there's a difference
[1:02:43] in a hunger and a lust that's right if
[1:02:45] you're hungry you can be filled right
[1:02:48] but you know what a lust is Jesus said
[1:02:50] lust not after the things of this world
[1:02:52] what is a lust it's no matter how much
[1:02:54] of it you get you cannot be
[1:02:57] satisfied that's what lust is it's just
[1:02:59] always striving and that and we find
[1:03:02] that inside of this message so many
[1:03:03] times there's always those give me more
[1:03:05] you ain't got enough at your church we
[1:03:07] got to go out and find a perfect Church
[1:03:09] yeah yeah amen how many how many found
[1:03:11] one of those along the way a perfect
[1:03:14] church I want a perfect
[1:03:16] Church yeah it would be perfect for a
[1:03:19] few
[1:03:20] days yeah sure till something said that
[1:03:23] crosses you and all ain't perfect no
[1:03:25] more right Perfection you know
[1:03:27] Perfection is a paradox as well we can
[1:03:30] show up here in all of our our our
[1:03:32] failures and all of our our our
[1:03:34] disappointments and all the things that
[1:03:36] are wrong with us and God can look at us
[1:03:39] and say be therefore perfect the
[1:03:42] Perfection is in the Commandment to be
[1:03:44] perfect it's not in us going out and
[1:03:46] getting perfect you want a perfect
[1:03:48] church just show up right exactly
[1:03:50] because the Perfection comes from the
[1:03:53] word
[1:03:55] man we done been trying to be perfect a
[1:03:57] long time what brother brand statue of a
[1:04:00] perfect man don't be putting the peacock
[1:04:02] feathers and a crow it ain't going to
[1:04:03] work right it's not going to work right
[1:04:06] amen exactly oh my goodness but the the
[1:04:10] filling is in the hungering the the
[1:04:12] answer to the hunger it's found in that
[1:04:15] word right you cannot come before this
[1:04:18] word you can't open your Bible at home
[1:04:21] saying Lord I'm just going through a
[1:04:22] struggle today I just need
[1:04:24] something and I know we we play you know
[1:04:27] the Ouija board game sometime we just
[1:04:29] flip and that's that's okay I'm not
[1:04:30] going to you know if that helps you
[1:04:32] right I don't mind going on the screen
[1:04:34] and getting the quote of the day out of
[1:04:35] Jeffersonville I enjoy that right it's
[1:04:38] better than getting the recap of last
[1:04:40] night soap hoer I want you to know

[1:07:16] a Christmas tree might get me you know
[1:07:20] yeah well I'd go see my family at

[1:07:23] just might get
[1:07:25] come
[1:07:26] on if you don't want to have one praise
[1:07:29] the Lord for that if you do want to read
[1:07:32] the quote where brother Randon went and
[1:07:33] cut one down with his kitties praise the
[1:07:35] Lord for that right just read them all
[1:07:39] right you know what I didn't wiah back
[1:07:41] at the first few days of December I
[1:07:42] printed out all of brother bram's
[1:07:44] Christmas messages all the titles it was
[1:07:46] like 17 18 of them through his ministry
[1:07:49] that we have on tape of the Christmas
[1:07:51] message and I just handed them out to
[1:07:53] the people I said
[1:07:54] here are all of brother Brandon's what
[1:07:56] he considered to be Christmas messages
[1:07:58] if you want to know whether you should
[1:07:59] have a tree whether you should give a
[1:08:01] present whether you want to believe in
[1:08:03] Santa Claus or not don't ask me yeah
[1:08:07] there's 17 or 18 messages here that he
[1:08:10] declared to be subjects about Christmas
[1:08:14] you hear them all and whatever God leads
[1:08:16] you to believe about that and do about
[1:08:19] that I said I hope you all you hear them
[1:08:21] all and you decide you all want to give
[1:08:23] me gift I said that's
[1:08:25] fine because when I read them that's all
[1:08:28] I could get out of it is everybody ought
[1:08:29] to bring me a present but they didn't do
[1:08:31] that either so so either they didn't go
[1:08:34] home and listen or something or or they
[1:08:36] didn't send it through the same filter I
[1:08:37] did
[1:08:40] but man we've lived through legalism
[1:08:43] right we've lived through too much grace
[1:08:46] too much legalism too much
[1:08:48] grace you ain't going to make everybody
[1:08:50] happy you know the thing about a
[1:08:51] legalist is he can't take much grace you
[1:08:54] know you know that you ever get around a
[1:08:56] real true legalist see any Grace shows
[1:09:00] up I don't know why I said
[1:09:03] that why I said that a man under grace
[1:09:06] he can stand a little bit of legal as
[1:09:08] usual not much but a little bit right
[1:09:11] because then he'll find out how much
[1:09:12] grace he's really
[1:09:14] under that's right brother oh Lord help
[1:09:17] us right let's get back to our text
[1:09:20] hungry that's all brother Bram said
[1:09:22] hungry are you
[1:09:24] are you hungry three miles ahead hungry
[1:09:26] three miles ahead that's that's that's
[1:09:28] the billboard that's all it says it's
[1:09:30] just drawing attention to the fact that
[1:09:34] the hunger the hunger is there he talks
[1:09:38] about Steven and
[1:09:39] Paul as he went on down through this
[1:09:41] message let your light so shine before
[1:09:43] men he he talks about Steven very much
[1:09:46] in this in this text he was God's
[1:09:48] advertisement board right this is what I
[1:09:51] was thinking about going into the New
[1:09:52] Year let us be an advertisement board
[1:09:54] let when they stoned him to death they
[1:09:57] throw him outside the city this is
[1:09:59] paragraph 50 in that same message or e50
[1:10:01] is the little paragraph number when they
[1:10:04] stoned him to death throw him outside
[1:10:05] the city beat him to death with stones
[1:10:07] when he was dying he raised his head to
[1:10:09] Heaven asked forgiveness for those who
[1:10:10] are Stone the same as Jesus did at the
[1:10:13] cross then God seen his little
[1:10:15] advertisement board being taken
[1:10:18] down Steven looked up to heaven he said
[1:10:20] behold I see Heavens open see Jesus
[1:10:22] standing at the right hand of go he fell
[1:10:24] asleep in the arms of God he was a
[1:10:26] advertisement board for a hungry world
[1:10:29] Amen you say well how many was there you
[1:10:32] said there was maybe 5,000 how many of
[1:10:34] them got saved see brother R's playing
[1:10:37] the part of the critic now he says you
[1:10:39] say well how many was there you said
[1:10:42] there was maybe 5,000 how many of them
[1:10:44] got saved there was
[1:10:46] [Applause]
[1:10:47] one 5,000 people watching the
[1:10:50] advertisement of God's word adverti
[1:10:52] right 5,000 people saw the billboard and
[1:10:56] there was one that got saved oh we ought
[1:10:59] to Rejoice about that aren't you that's
[1:11:01] why I know Lula ain't very big but I
[1:11:03] live in the middle of Witchita 450,000
[1:11:06] people we got a group of 60 or 80
[1:11:08] Believers there yeah but there was one
[1:11:12] he never accepted it right then but
[1:11:14] years later amen if you went away from
[1:11:17] that meeting you'd ask how many got
[1:11:19] saved in that meeting we'd say none
[1:11:21] right but brother said there was one he
[1:11:23] didn't know it yet cuz he went on out
[1:11:26] there destroying some more
[1:11:28] Christians he says see now no matter how
[1:11:31] much I could reflect it here unless it
[1:11:33] reflects on you too will never
[1:11:35] understand the
[1:11:36] gospel would be of none effect unless
[1:11:38] somebody was there to take it there'll
[1:11:40] be many who won't take it but the ones
[1:11:41] who will take it it'll reflect in them
[1:11:44] there's maybe 5,000 that morning at the
[1:11:47] execution of Steven but there was
[1:11:49] one one it reflected in even at the end
[1:11:53] of his life he says I'm not even worthy
[1:11:54] to be called one of the Saints because
[1:11:56] I've persecuted the Church of God to
[1:11:58] death give consent to the stoning of
[1:12:01] that martyr it never did get away from
[1:12:03] Paul he said I persecuted the church
[1:12:05] even to death see it never got away from
[1:12:07] him right because he seen Christ
[1:12:11] reflected I asked brother brother Wade
[1:12:14] when he was showing me in the church
[1:12:15] here today these pictures on the
[1:12:17] platform here they've seen that
[1:12:20] reflection he he was explaining to me
[1:12:21] y'all pray for these people the word
[1:12:24] goes across these it's across these
[1:12:26] people's lives somewhere it'll never get
[1:12:29] away from them there is truth to train
[1:12:32] up a child in the way he's going and
[1:12:34] when he when he's old he won't depart
[1:12:37] this is what he's saying about Paul it
[1:12:38] never got away from him when he seen
[1:12:40] that how did Steven do it he never
[1:12:42] performed any Miracles although he know
[1:12:44] that Christ was a miracle performer he
[1:12:46] knowed all these powers and things but
[1:12:48] what did he do he just presented his
[1:12:50] life in such a way that they seemed that
[1:12:53] it was the power of Christ Glory he just
[1:12:57] lived he didn't do a lot of Miracles
[1:13:00] didn't do a lot of supernal a lot of
[1:13:02] signs and wonders right and oh brother
[1:13:04] br's going to let a lot of us off the
[1:13:05] hook right here you ready for this next
[1:13:07] quote you may never see a vision
[1:13:10] right oh man we all want to see Visions
[1:13:13] don't we right you may never see a
[1:13:16] vision you may never put your hands on
[1:13:19] the sick person and feel the charge of
[1:13:21] almighty God make a skeleton of a man
[1:13:23] turned back to life
[1:13:26] again y brother R letting us down easy
[1:13:29] ain't he you may never see him standing
[1:13:32] over Yonder in three or four
[1:13:34] rainbows you may never see his image you
[1:13:37] may never hear his voice but still you
[1:13:41] can be a signboard and manifest Jesus
[1:13:43] Christ by A Life That's so pure
[1:13:45] unadulterated from the world not
[1:13:47] worrying about the dirty things around
[1:13:49] your life but a pure thing because God
[1:13:52] is in your heart to hunger and thir
[1:13:53] thirst to be like him you may never do
[1:13:56] any of those things you know there is
[1:13:58] one quote where brother says God may
[1:14:00] never answer another prayer for you for
[1:14:02] the rest of your days and you can still
[1:14:04] be a child of God hard to imagine that
[1:14:08] isn't it right we look back at how many
[1:14:10] he's answered for us through all the
[1:14:12] years and brother no he may never answer
[1:14:14] another one and it does not have any
[1:14:17] bearing on your election and your
[1:14:19] salvation and your walk with him how
[1:14:22] many of you want to go through 2012
[1:14:24] knowing that God may never answer
[1:14:26] another prayer for me how many still
[1:14:28] going to believe him then how many still
[1:14:31] going to hold on to this word now we've
[1:14:33] got the word of a prophet it has nothing
[1:14:36] to do with your election you may never
[1:14:38] hear his voice you may never see the
[1:14:40] rainbows you may never pray for a man
[1:14:42] and he'll get well
[1:14:44] again but you are still
[1:14:46] his I am his and he is mine and His
[1:14:49] Banner Over In Me Is Love why was it
[1:14:52] always that what God is doing for us was
[1:14:55] some kind of an indication of who we are
[1:14:57] right what if God does nothing for you
[1:14:59] the rest of your day what if you have
[1:15:02] prayers and needs and things that you
[1:15:04] want right and it never happens you
[1:15:07] still going to be coming to church well
[1:15:09] it might be a little harder but we're
[1:15:10] going to try am sure we're all going to
[1:15:12] be honest and admit that we believe the
[1:15:15] Lord will help us am but it's not a
[1:15:17] bearing on our Rel amen that's right I
[1:15:19] like the way brother you may never do
[1:15:21] any of these things right
[1:15:23] down in paragraph 56 Paul was
[1:15:25] successfully in having Steven Stone but
[1:15:28] all through his life until he
[1:15:29] surrendered to Christ he he was never
[1:15:31] able to get away from that message
[1:15:34] something got a hold of him it wasn't
[1:15:37] the messenger it was the message he had
[1:15:40] righten if there is a prayer in your
[1:15:42] heart brothers and sisters about this
[1:15:44] end time message I know we print them
[1:15:46] off on the computer now and we used to
[1:15:48] bring up all the books but if there is
[1:15:49] something that you need to be sure of in
[1:15:51] your heart it is that it wasn't the
[1:15:54] messenger it was the message that's
[1:15:56] right there's a lot of people that are
[1:15:58] hung up on the messenger they follow the
[1:16:01] message because of the messenger right
[1:16:03] it wasn't the messenger that Paul saw it
[1:16:06] was the message that he had amen that's
[1:16:09] right in another message
[1:16:13] called that was in the message the
[1:16:15] oncoming storm the one I just read in a
[1:16:18] message called I know brother random
[1:16:19] said
[1:16:21] this that how that talking about Paul
[1:16:23] the Apostle that that great Apostle who
[1:16:27] had been through his time of trouble
[1:16:28] when he witnessed the death of Steven he
[1:16:31] seen his little face look up towards
[1:16:33] heaven the Rocks was beating him in the
[1:16:34] face and he looked up and he said I see
[1:16:36] the heavens open I see Jesus standing on
[1:16:37] the right hand Glory he said Lord lay
[1:16:40] not this send to their charge and Paul
[1:16:42] holding the coats that had put him for
[1:16:45] weeks and weeks on the ash he walking
[1:16:47] back and forth till his mind had been
[1:16:49] polluted until he was down on his road
[1:16:51] to Damascus to try to fight a way out
[1:16:53] like a man going to a whiskey bottle to
[1:16:56] try to drown his sorrow that's the shape
[1:16:59] it put Paul in right I never knew that's
[1:17:01] what was happening on his road down to
[1:17:02] Damascus brother BR said he was on his
[1:17:05] road down to Damascus to try to find a
[1:17:06] way out of that pressure that was in his
[1:17:08] mind like a man go into a whiskey bottle
[1:17:10] to try to drown out his sorrow that's
[1:17:13] what Paul was going to do down there in
[1:17:14] Damascus trying to get away from what he
[1:17:16] had done but he couldn't get away from
[1:17:18] it because it wasn't the messenger right
[1:17:21] Steven's corpse was dead and rot by then
[1:17:24] and Paul was still carrying the way of
[1:17:26] that because why there was an
[1:17:29] advertisement there was an advertisement
[1:17:31] that he put forth thank you I have asked
[1:17:34] the Lord daily as I've looked at this
[1:17:35] text and thought about bringing it to
[1:17:37] you I want 2012 yeah I want it to be
[1:17:40] different for me I don't want to go out
[1:17:42] and make it different I just want him to
[1:17:44] make it different because if I go out
[1:17:46] and make it different I'm going to mess
[1:17:47] it up right amen oh man I I can try to
[1:17:50] be as spiritual as I want I mean I can
[1:17:53] hold my Bible just right more often come
[1:17:56] on y'all been there y'all been in church
[1:17:58] you church folks know what I'm talking
[1:18:00] about you message folks know I can say
[1:18:03] good evening friends just as nicely as I
[1:18:06] can I can wear bigger Bell buckles and
[1:18:09] bolo TI all I want right that's trying
[1:18:12] to make it different right I want 2012
[1:18:15] my life to be different I want it to be
[1:18:18] an advertisement board just like Stevens
[1:18:21] was that it'll make that hunger it'll
[1:18:24] drive a man back to that word it'll
[1:18:27] it'll Quicken something in him that just
[1:18:29] by seeing that
[1:18:32] life thank the
[1:18:35] Lord in a message called godhead
[1:18:37] explained you know this message well in
[1:18:39] Chicago brother br's there talking to
[1:18:40] those
[1:18:42] preachers he said I've always thought
[1:18:44] about the death of Steven it must have
[1:18:46] got on to Paul because when he seen the
[1:18:48] Glorious look on Steven's face and the
[1:18:50] clouds was beating him to death he said
[1:18:52] I see see Jesus stand at the right hand
[1:18:54] of God he says you know you can kill a
[1:18:55] messenger but you can never kill his
[1:18:57] messenger if it's real right I like read
[1:19:01] that quote again you can kill a
[1:19:03] messenger but you can never kill his
[1:19:05] message if it's real there's some
[1:19:08] messages that are going to die and why
[1:19:10] because they're not real but if it's
[1:19:11] real amen it'll live and the message
[1:19:16] though Steven was gone on to stand with
[1:19:18] Jesus yet his message lingered on
[1:19:20] because Paul kept talking about it right
[1:19:24] that's what it's stuck to him that's
[1:19:25] what brother is trying to say in
[1:19:27] Abraham's Covenant in Middletown
[1:19:30] Ohio some he said what's the matter with
[1:19:32] me anyhow I'm only telling you the truth
[1:19:34] someday you'll catch it someday you'll
[1:19:36] know that I've told you the truth my
[1:19:38] voice may be silent you might be able to
[1:19:41] silence the body that's speaking but
[1:19:42] you'll never silence that voice that's
[1:19:45] right it comes from God they Stone
[1:19:47] Steven but they couldn't stop his
[1:19:49] message it'll move on right them tapes
[1:19:51] will be played after I'm gone for
[1:19:55] years them tapes will be played After
[1:19:57] I'm Gone oh Lord let it be so amen
[1:20:00] here's a couple of more quotes for you
[1:20:02] do you mind quotes I love I love the
[1:20:04] quotes I like the way brother Rand says
[1:20:05] things yes sir we this isn't let your
[1:20:08] light so shine back to that other
[1:20:09] message paragraph 45 we should be in
[1:20:12] such a condition that would cause all
[1:20:14] the world to want to be like us right
[1:20:16] because men would go down the street and
[1:20:18] say there's a man I might disagree with
[1:20:20] him on his religious Doctrine but I tell
[1:20:22] you one
[1:20:23] that is a genuine
[1:20:26] Christian we don't like those quotes
[1:20:28] because why doctrine's everything
[1:20:30] anymore doctr well he don't believe the
[1:20:33] doctrine like I do brother R say I would
[1:20:35] rather be even if I don't agree in
[1:20:37] Doctrine let him at least know I'm a
[1:20:39] Christian let him at least believe in me
[1:20:42] enough to say I don't agree with what
[1:20:43] that man is looking at but at least I
[1:20:45] believe he is a genu one Christian ought
[1:20:48] to be women going down the streets say
[1:20:50] she may look oldfashioned she may not be
[1:20:52] like the rest of the women you see but
[1:20:53] there's one Christian in this town and
[1:20:56] there she goes because we are sponsored
[1:20:59] by Jesus
[1:21:00] Christen oh what kind of a person should
[1:21:03] we be if we are his Billboards and we're
[1:21:06] sponsored by him then in Christ is the
[1:21:09] one where we get our life we get our
[1:21:10] strength we get all that we have comes
[1:21:12] from Christ he is our sponsor he is the
[1:21:15] one wrote on this billboard right the
[1:21:18] brother said in paragraph 47 the thing
[1:21:20] that we want to do is to preach a gospel
[1:21:22] that appe appeals to a hungry World y he
[1:21:24] said how can you appeal to a hungry
[1:21:26] world that won't even see where they'
[1:21:27] come from or who they are or where
[1:21:29] they're going unless you preach a gospel
[1:21:31] that raises Christ up in a living
[1:21:33] atmosphere right here around us now amen
[1:21:36] we cannot do it there's no way which we
[1:21:38] could join the Masons or the Oddfellows
[1:21:40] or any other Lodge joining some Lodge
[1:21:42] would be just as well but we're to
[1:21:44] preach a gospel that's appealing to
[1:21:46] Hungry people that'll catch those who
[1:21:49] are hungering and thirsting for
[1:21:51] righteousness
[1:21:53] be a billboard that's what brother
[1:21:54] randam is telling us that's right and
[1:21:57] let your light so shine before men
[1:21:58] paragraph 51 he said we don't have to
[1:22:00] have big
[1:22:01] audiences that's a hard one isn't it we
[1:22:03] don't have to have big audiences our
[1:22:05] church can be small right we don't have
[1:22:08] to preach the 10,000 we don't even have
[1:22:10] to preach yeah right that's what he said
[1:22:12] it's right there we don't have to even
[1:22:14] preach we can be God's advertisement
[1:22:16] board Y how do you know look at this
[1:22:20] question how do you know that your life
[1:22:22] might not start some young man on the
[1:22:24] gospel some of you older men you old
[1:22:26] women start them young men on the field
[1:22:28] out there to win 10,000 souls to Christ
[1:22:33] how do you know how do you know we don't
[1:22:35] know it was because that he saw Christ
[1:22:37] in you it's you presented Christ to him
[1:22:40] in the simple power of the Gospel
[1:22:42] right the only way we see Christ is when
[1:22:45] he reflects in each other I see Christ
[1:22:48] in you you see him in me that's how we
[1:22:51] watch Christ amen I come to the
[1:22:54] meeting oh now he's going to get out to
[1:22:57] personal now I come to the meeting I
[1:22:58] start I start preaching I watch the
[1:23:02] people you can see whether they're
[1:23:04] interested or not in just a few minutes
[1:23:07] right now it wasn't no no prophetic gift
[1:23:10] that was able that's right amen I have
[1:23:13] to say I'm not a real spiritual person
[1:23:15] yeah but I can tell in a few minutes
[1:23:17] whether you're interested or not you
[1:23:19] ain't got to be a prophet for that no
[1:23:21] you're back there fou in your nails then
[1:23:23] I know you're just not very interested
[1:23:25] you right come
[1:23:27] on you know again brother R tells us
[1:23:29] some things that we already know I can
[1:23:31] tell
[1:23:34] right you can see whether they're
[1:23:36] interested or not in just a few minutes
[1:23:37] you look all over the audience you can
[1:23:39] tell who you're
[1:23:41] boring y'all didn't know I could tell
[1:23:43] that could
[1:23:44] you all right all of you that know that
[1:23:47] I can tell that you're bored that you
[1:23:48] think I'm boring go on and raise your
[1:23:49] hand yeah one guy back there he
[1:23:54] you thank you for that brother your
[1:23:56] honesty is appreciated I don't want to
[1:23:59] be boring but it happens
[1:24:01] sometimes you can tell who you're boring
[1:24:03] or whether you're not see and the first
[1:24:05] thing you know you see them standing
[1:24:07] there hanging on to every word under
[1:24:09] expectation right see there's the boring
[1:24:12] crowd and there's those who want I'm
[1:24:14] seeing Christ reflected in that person
[1:24:16] because he's hungering and thirsting for
[1:24:18] God and then me preaching the gospel he
[1:24:20] sees Christ reflecting in me I see
[1:24:22] Christ reflecting in him that means
[1:24:25] Christ is in our midst hungering and
[1:24:27] thirsting I watch the audience how they
[1:24:29] take it say something another watch what
[1:24:32] effect it takes on them watch their face
[1:24:34] light up full of joy they're ready right
[1:24:36] then to receive something that's Christ

[1:31:26] ingredient yeah in north book Illinois a
[1:31:29] suburb Chicago sales of hadacol were
[1:31:32] limited to liquor

[1:31:38] with testimonials to the powers of the
[1:31:41] seemingly miraculous yet foul tasting
[1:31:45] brown liquid and he he had a jingle

[1:33:09] this is 1950 listen at this Statistics
[1:33:11] in a n in a 15-month period ending in
[1:33:15] March
[1:33:16] 1951 leblan sold more than
[1:33:20] $3,600,000
[1:33:22] worth of this
[1:33:24] tonic that's a lot of money back in
[1:33:27] 1951 he sold more than
[1:33:30] $3,600,000 worth of the tonic in another
[1:33:33] 6 months leblan sold his interest of the
[1:33:37] leblan corporation which was hadac
[1:33:39] Call's parent company to investors for
[1:33:43] 8.2
[1:33:46] million we don't want no hadacol sale
[1:33:49] what were they selling alcohol right and
[1:33:52] calling it supplements and calling it
[1:33:53] some kind of an Elixir that was going to
[1:33:55] fix everything yeah and it was drink it
[1:33:58] was liquor right and and he sold his his
[1:34:01] his part of the company for $8.2 million
[1:34:04] in
[1:34:05] 1951 but the Enterprise collapsed under
[1:34:08] the weight of its debtors right it was
[1:34:11] discovered all too late that LeBlanc was
[1:34:12] spending more for advertising than he
[1:34:15] was taking in in
[1:34:17] receipts and turning his $3.6 million
[1:34:20] profit into a one .8 million second
[1:34:22] quarter loss yeah he was advertising
[1:34:26] right and he was selling it yep but he
[1:34:29] he he had concealed almost $2 million in
[1:34:31] unpaid bills $656,000 in ta tax debts
[1:34:36] and another two million was listed on
[1:34:38] the ledgers as accounts receivable which
[1:34:41] was simply cases of tonic out and
[1:34:44] Consignment I guess the best there's a
[1:34:46] lot of this but the best testimony came
[1:34:48] from from Groucho marks you all know who
[1:34:51] Groucho marks was in 1952 there was an
[1:34:54] interview that leblan gave to grouo
[1:34:56] Marx's radio program when Groucho asked
[1:34:59] him what hadac call was good
[1:35:01] for you ready for this what was hadac
[1:35:04] call good for he had Groucho marks ask
[1:35:06] him what hadac call was good for leblan
[1:35:08] gave an answer of startling honesty it
[1:35:10] was good the senator said for 55 million
[1:35:14] last
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:20] year well this product good for about 52
[1:35:23] million last year that's what it was
[1:35:25] good for the name of hadacol has become
[1:35:29] synonymous with a cure all of any
[1:35:31] dubious origin right right we don't want
[1:35:34] know how to call sale we don't want
[1:35:37] something that's just pumped up and
[1:35:38] advertised up and singing and dancing
[1:35:40] and parrots and gold limousines and
[1:35:43] television
[1:35:45] ads brother random didn't want it for
[1:35:47] his message he didn't want the $6
[1:35:50] million churches
[1:35:52] right I know y'all remodeled a lot but I
[1:35:54] know you hadn't reached 6 million on
[1:35:56] this place yet so you're still in the
[1:35:58] message right he talked about building
[1:36:01] those $6 million Cathedrals right he
[1:36:04] wasn't interested in the money he wanted
[1:36:06] his gospel to be presented he wanted to
[1:36:09] be a signboard for us to follow not with
[1:36:12] blitz and Glamour and
[1:36:15] advertising you know what's startling
[1:36:17] I've got a quote right here in my
[1:36:19] notes this kind shot me can I read you
[1:36:22] something you know I'm not going to pick
[1:36:24] on or robers because he's he's dead and
[1:36:26] gone
[1:36:29] now did it bother brother brandom that
[1:36:31] he didn't have the following or Roberts
[1:36:33] did no he knew his message was different
[1:36:36] from that but but yeah here's a very
[1:36:38] honest confession this is in Saskatoon
[1:36:40] in a message called Stand still he said
[1:36:42] I was in a meeting not long ago at the
[1:36:44] cad
[1:36:45] Tabernacle I preached for five nights
[1:36:47] now Cale Tabernacle is in Indianapolis
[1:36:49] y'all know where e Howard Cale talked
[1:36:51] about him a lot I preached for Five
[1:36:54] Nights with the place packed out and my
[1:36:56] love offering was about $1,000 now this
[1:36:59] is 1957 he's telling this okay follow me
[1:37:03] along I believe brother Roberts the
[1:37:05] night that he come he said I want from
[1:37:08] the middle of this this side 60 men to
[1:37:10] stand and say tonight they'll pledge me
[1:37:14] $1,000 60,000 just on half a side of the
[1:37:18] same crowd that I had right
[1:37:22] that's all right he needs it he must
[1:37:24] have it to carry on exactly what's
[1:37:27] brother R saying we don't want to know
[1:37:28] how to call sale we're not I preached
[1:37:30] five nights and my offering was $11,000
[1:37:33] right right he said another man came in
[1:37:35] and the same crowd yeah the same crowd
[1:37:39] that I had he on the first night asked
[1:37:42] 60 men to pledge him
[1:37:44] $60,000 well don't you reckon the other
[1:37:46] half got under the inspiration of that
[1:37:48] probably gave him another 60 right right
[1:37:51] but brother R him didn't he said he said
[1:37:53] I know he said the Lord just know that I
[1:37:55] didn't have that much
[1:37:56] sense I'm not intelligent enough for
[1:37:59] that my mean I don't I don't have to
[1:38:00] have very much my expenses run me I
[1:38:02] think I counted about G what was it $100
[1:38:05] a day from my office in my hke yeah he
[1:38:08] says well that's quite a different well
[1:38:10] I guess that's quite a different right
[1:38:12] $100 a day versus 60,000 on the first
[1:38:15] night from the same crowd in the same
[1:38:17] par
[1:38:19] exactly come on brothers and sisters his
[1:38:22] gospel was not out there to sell like
[1:38:24] that that's why those women could hand
[1:38:26] him those million dooll checks and he
[1:38:28] could walk away from it the vineyard man
[1:38:30] out there in California could hand him
[1:38:32] those $1.5 million checks and he could
[1:38:34] say I don't want it right he wasn't
[1:38:37] selling the gospel he was he was a
[1:38:39] sideboard for the gospel that's why when
[1:38:41] we hear these messages we we we look at
[1:38:44] these charlott on TV and we look at all
[1:38:46] these the Jimmy swaggers of the world we
[1:38:50] have a we have a full old time radio
[1:38:51] station in witch nothing but Jimmy
[1:38:53] Swagger all day long oh my it's a I
[1:38:56] passed by because I like the hecko every
[1:38:58] once in a while and so I do I stop by
[1:39:01] they he I heard him the other day on the
[1:39:03] radio telling the people three days a
[1:39:05] month now of every month they have to
[1:39:08] dedicate it to what they call um the the
[1:39:12] the the Gathering in selling the Bibles
[1:39:14] and getting the money out and he was
[1:39:16] speaking to his own shame he said it 3
[1:39:18] days a month to put this thing to make
[1:39:21] this machine run I have to have these
[1:39:24] sherons or whatever they call them and
[1:39:27] they're selling Bibles and and and they
[1:39:29] got Donnie the son on there he's reading
[1:39:31] $300 on a credit card from from
[1:39:34] somewhere in Oklahoma and and oh man
[1:39:37] they give a big whoop if you get up to a
[1:39:39] thousand oh yeah $1,000 on credit card
[1:39:42] they always want you to know you can put
[1:39:43] it on your credit card
[1:39:45] yeah y y'all don't have those machines
[1:39:47] here do you for TI off just I didn't
[1:39:50] want to get on a bad
[1:39:52] so that's the way Jimmy Swagger does it
[1:39:54] on credit card they'll let you know
[1:39:56] every time on credit card cuz they know
[1:39:58] they're talking to people that are
[1:39:59] hurting right right I know you're
[1:40:01] hurting but if you got $27 left on
[1:40:03] available balance on your credit card
[1:40:05] call in and give it to me we don't want
[1:40:08] that kind of a sale I appreciate a
[1:40:11] church that wants to run on what God
[1:40:12] provides and take care of its Ministry
[1:40:15] and take care of the needs of the church
[1:40:18] and you ain't got to be on money every
[1:40:20] week right you ain't got to remind
[1:40:22] people if you don't know by now you
[1:40:23] ought to be paying your TI and offering
[1:40:26] there's something wrong with this
[1:40:27] picture you're robbing God if you're not
[1:40:29] paying your TI and offering we don't
[1:40:31] need to rehearse that that's right I
[1:40:33] mean if you're brand new and we got to
[1:40:34] run it by you that's okay but but
[1:40:37] brothers and sisters it's it's gone to
[1:40:39] that but this is what brother Brandon is
[1:40:40] saying we don't want that kind of a
[1:40:42] gospel we don't want it right right he
[1:40:44] said I I I guess God just couldn't trust
[1:40:46] me with that much money right I just
[1:40:48] didn't have enough sense to use it you
[1:40:51] you're not going to tell me he didn't
[1:40:52] hurt his feelings a little bit to think
[1:40:53] that the same crowd that heard the true
[1:40:56] gospel thought it was worth about a
[1:40:58] grand over five nights and or Roberts
[1:41:01] that had really not a whole lot to say
[1:41:04] compared to what brother brandham had to
[1:41:05] offer right could raise 60,000 one I you
[1:41:08] know what the difference was he asked
[1:41:10] for it he asked 60 people 60 men on this
[1:41:14] side and they do it Jimmy Swagger will
[1:41:17] get on the radio God has shown me
[1:41:19] there's going to be a th000 men give
[1:41:22] $1,000 well if that's true you don't
[1:41:24] need to tell nobody you know what you
[1:41:28] know exactly and they'll tell you on day
[1:41:30] two of the shareon we've only got 217 of
[1:41:32] those thousand but I know they're coming
[1:41:35] because God said they were going to do
[1:41:36] it well then you don't even need to
[1:41:37] advertise it right if God told you it
[1:41:40] was going to happen then just let it
[1:41:41] happen right
[1:41:44] exactly had to call sales that this this
[1:41:47] you know I read something Billy Graham
[1:41:49] said in his magazine that's sitting in
[1:41:51] the doctor's office here a little while
[1:41:53] back and I picked up one of Billy
[1:41:54] Graham's magazines and he was talking
[1:41:56] about the state of Christianity in
[1:41:58] America he said you know Christianity is
[1:42:00] 3,000 miles wide meaning that it's
[1:42:03] covered the whole whole nation of of
[1:42:05] America but he said it's only 3 in
[1:42:09] deep and I thought a never a truer
[1:42:11] statement that he made 3,000 Mi wide and
[1:42:14] 3 Ines deep it hasn't permeated the
[1:42:17] crust right of humanity yet it's spread
[1:42:21] out they bought it they've sold it
[1:42:23] they've promoted it they've advertised
[1:42:25] it they put it on the radio they put it
[1:42:26] on the TV they they propagated it and
[1:42:30] it's 3,000 Mi wide but it ain't breaking
[1:42:32] the crust it's hardly getting down to
[1:42:34] where the real nutrients
[1:42:36] flow The Roots aren't going very deep
[1:42:40] right right what did Brother Brandon say
[1:42:42] I I I got the quotes here he was talking
[1:42:44] about about about the the need of the
[1:42:47] believer he says the whole purpose is
[1:42:49] just to S suck in more more water than
[1:42:51] you really need to live on let me read
[1:42:53] you that you got a second we got a lot
[1:42:56] of time I know else y'all going to be
[1:42:57] singing a long
[1:42:59] time let me read you
[1:43:02] this me read you this I got it here hang
[1:43:05] on bear with
[1:43:08] me why you know when I try to prepare
[1:43:11] for this much of a meeting I just I just
[1:43:13] do too many quotes you doing too many
[1:43:17] quotes bear with me just bear with me
[1:43:21] I know you know this quote
[1:43:24] anyway he said you take a little tree
[1:43:26] this is an expectations in Jon B
[1:43:29] Arkansas
[1:43:31] right you take a little tree you stick
[1:43:34] it in the ground and you plant it it's
[1:43:36] got to grow it has to draw the moisture
[1:43:37] from the ground
[1:43:39] right it has to draw more than what its
[1:43:43] allotted portion is y you have to give
[1:43:46] it plenty of water you just have to give
[1:43:47] it water it drinks and drinks and drinks
[1:43:49] till it can't hardly drink no more and
[1:43:51] then it just starts pushing out and it
[1:43:53] pushes out limbs it pushes out leaves it
[1:43:55] pushes out blossoms pushes out apples
[1:43:58] the apples was on the inside of it at
[1:44:00] the beginning and it just has to drink
[1:44:02] and every man that's born again in
[1:44:03] Christ everything you have need of your
[1:44:06] healing Satan will afflict you sure he
[1:44:07] will but everything you have need of in
[1:44:10] the whole life's journey is in you right
[1:44:12] then right right and we are planted in
[1:44:14] Christ Jesus when you're born again the
[1:44:16] baptism of the Holy Spirit has come into
[1:44:18] your heart you have everything that have
[1:44:20] need of for the journey the only thing
[1:44:23] you have to do is start drinking
[1:44:25] drinking pushing out drinking and
[1:44:27] pushing out I believe he hears my
[1:44:29] analysis of Christ Jesus he's the
[1:44:31] inexhaustible Fountain of Life and every
[1:44:34] man that's planted in him can drink and
[1:44:36] drink and push out and to every
[1:44:39] Redemptive blessing that God has
[1:44:41] promised belongs to you and it's your
[1:44:42] personal property the devil hasn't got
[1:44:44] any tatto it at all he hasn't got any
[1:44:46] legal rights his legal rights was
[1:44:49] spoiled calary amen right in Denim
[1:44:52] Springs Louisiana talking about the same
[1:44:53] thing sir we would see Jesus just like
[1:44:56] your trees out here if was an apple tree
[1:44:58] you ever think of that it's not one inch
[1:45:00] high but every Apple that'll ever be in
[1:45:01] the tree is in it right there that's
[1:45:03] right 1000 bushels if there's that many
[1:45:05] say 500 bushels of Apple come off a tree
[1:45:08] all 500 bushels of apples was in it when
[1:45:11] it's planted if it isn't where did they
[1:45:13] come from see you just planted it just
[1:45:15] has to draw in water draw it in from the
[1:45:17] earth it just has to draw till it gets
[1:45:19] so much more than its portion and then
[1:45:22] it pushes out limbs pushes out leaves
[1:45:24] pushes out blossoms pushes out apples
[1:45:27] pushes them out don't bring them in push
[1:45:29] them out right so then I think Christ is
[1:45:32] the inexhaustible Fountain of Life Glory
[1:45:35] oh my we are planted in him all we do is
[1:45:38] drink from the fountain push out
[1:45:39] everything that we have need of in this
[1:45:41] amen all the things that we have need of
[1:45:43] is in him we are planted in him and draw
[1:45:45] from him and he is the inexhaustable
[1:45:48] Fountain of Life that's right
[1:45:51] ain't that wonderful same thing in God
[1:45:53] in his word Oakland California you take
[1:45:55] a little tree you plant it there's only
[1:45:56] one thing you have to do to that tree
[1:45:57] and that's water it it's got to drink
[1:46:00] it's got to drink more than its portion
[1:46:03] right it's got to drink till it swells
[1:46:05] out it pushes out leaves pushes out
[1:46:07] branches pushes out oranges it's just
[1:46:10] got to drink drink drink drink and push
[1:46:12] out right what have we got to do drink
[1:46:15] and push drink and push drink and push I
[1:46:18] believe that's what the church the
[1:46:19] Christians got to do is just sit down by
[1:46:21] Jesus Christ and his word I believe that
[1:46:24] he is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[1:46:27] that man can be planted in him and drink
[1:46:30] and push and drink and push till every
[1:46:32] Divine promise in the Bible will be made
[1:46:35] manifest oh don't you believe that do
[1:46:38] you believe that tonight that's all you
[1:46:39] got to do is drink and push it's too
[1:46:41] easy if it was harder we would enjoy it
[1:46:44] more but it's too easy feed and Grow
[1:46:48] Feed and grow what does a lamb have to
[1:46:50] to do eat he eats and he grows the
[1:46:53] calves of the stall what does the Cal in
[1:46:54] the stall do he eats and he grows right
[1:46:57] that's what brother R's whole message is
[1:46:59] telling us it's presented out there to
[1:47:01] let you know all you have to do is draw
[1:47:03] from it right amen but oh we're just
[1:47:05] we're just we're just so tonked up and
[1:47:09] choked up with things of the world
[1:47:11] sometimes that we don't want to feed on
[1:47:12] the good things of the world we'd rather
[1:47:14] go home and try to find our satisfaction
[1:47:16] out of some kind of a soap oper or some
[1:47:17] kind of a an entertainment of the world
[1:47:21] right the truth of it is all God wants
[1:47:23] us to do is sit down by the
[1:47:24] inexhaustible Fountain of Life and drink
[1:47:28] and feed and let it push out and drink
[1:47:30] and push and drink and push and
[1:47:33] amen I found this little quote just
[1:47:36] yesterday or or this morning looking at
[1:47:38] my
[1:47:39] notes the very first message brother man
[1:47:41] preach faith is a substance he says the
[1:47:44] day that we're living in is such a day
[1:47:46] of unsettled peace and unsettled rest
[1:47:48] everywhere this is 1947 first first
[1:47:50] recorded message we got people are
[1:47:53] running to and fr seeking whatever they
[1:47:55] may see most anybody can get a following
[1:47:57] yeah and that the truth today you think
[1:47:59] it was true in
[1:48:00] 1947 exactly most anybody can get a
[1:48:03] following right you look around at the
[1:48:05] people that have a following yeah I
[1:48:08] watch them I I listen to what they have
[1:48:09] to say and I just rehearse brother
[1:48:11] Bron's quote in my mind most anybody can
[1:48:13] get a following right right if it was
[1:48:15] true in 1947 it's really true today I
[1:48:19] watch churches I I on the internet I
[1:48:21] watch pastors up there what they call
[1:48:23] preaching to their people and I'm just
[1:48:25] sitting there thinking what brother R
[1:48:26] said most anybody can get a
[1:48:28] following people that true seed of God
[1:48:32] deserve better than that and they will
[1:48:33] come to the world yes sir but most
[1:48:35] anybody can get a following no matter
[1:48:37] what they teach or thinks somebody will
[1:48:39] listen to them right right amen if it
[1:48:41] was true in 1947 it's really true today
[1:48:45] I heard I read a little thing the other
[1:48:46] day guy was saying that if a if a memo
[1:48:48] blows off of the 27th floor of of a
[1:48:51] high-rise building in California it's
[1:48:53] got 15 converts by the time it hits the
[1:48:57] ground they have statistically proven
[1:48:59] that after 27 floors of freef fall it'll
[1:49:02] have 15 convers before it gets the
[1:49:05] area that's what brother brandom is
[1:49:07] saying most anybody can get a following
[1:49:10] and it's the day that the prophet spoke
[1:49:11] of people when they're hungry they'll
[1:49:13] eat from anywhere if children and people
[1:49:15] are starving they'll eat from a garbage
[1:49:17] can they once eat from a nice table but
[1:49:20] if they are hungry they'll eat somewhere
[1:49:23] so I think real true minister of the
[1:49:25] Gospel ought to be up and going ought to
[1:49:27] be giving the people the right things
[1:49:29] meet in due season amen that's what the
[1:49:34] that's what the real true Ministers of
[1:49:36] the Gospel ought to be up and going
[1:49:38] giving the people what right spiritual
[1:49:40] food and you see right spiritual food
[1:49:44] and SE I see so much in this message
[1:49:47] that is just just just a history like
[1:49:50] and just a a rehearsing of of brother
[1:49:53] Brand's lifestyle and what he did and
[1:49:55] all of those things are good but you
[1:49:57] must remember brothers and sisters we
[1:49:59] are following the message not the mess
[1:50:02] there are people that that you know what
[1:50:05] as it's been know you've heard it said
[1:50:06] so many times what if Rebecca had fallen
[1:50:08] in fallen in love with the messenger
[1:50:10] instead of the one she was going to meet
[1:50:12] yeah right she didn't fall in love with
[1:50:13] elazer he was just the one bringing the
[1:50:15] message right right it was the messenger
[1:50:19] he was the messenger he he came
[1:50:21] declaring the news that Isaac is on his
[1:50:23] way right Amen brother Bram never wanted
[1:50:25] those things to happen that's right
[1:50:28] hungry in Luke 11 quickly if you want to
[1:50:31] turn there a couple of verses of
[1:50:34] scripture that you can think on in the
[1:50:37] in the days ahead as you look back on
[1:50:38] this service and think of some of the
[1:50:40] things we were looking at in Luke
[1:50:44] 11 Jesus asked the question verse
[1:50:48] 11 if a son shall ask bread of any of
[1:50:51] you that is the father will he give him
[1:50:53] a stone if he ask for a fish will he for
[1:50:56] a fish give him a serpent if he asks for
[1:50:59] an egg will he offer him a scorpion if
[1:51:01] you then being evil know how to give
[1:51:02] good gifts unto your children how much
[1:51:04] more shall your heavenly father give the
[1:51:07] Holy Spirit to them that ask him
[1:51:10] hungering and thirsting if you know how
[1:51:12] to ask if you ask for these things amen
[1:51:15] and you being carnal if you ask for
[1:51:17] bread your father's not going to give
[1:51:19] you a stone if you for fish you won't
[1:51:20] get a Ser if you want an egg before you
[1:51:23] ask before you even ask Matthew 68 your
[1:51:26] father knoweth what things you have need
[1:51:28] of exactly before you ask
[1:51:32] right brother random had to work on us a
[1:51:34] little bit about our prayer lives about
[1:51:36] how we should pray right about the vain
[1:51:38] repetitions that we go through and and
[1:51:41] brothers and sisters I don't I don't
[1:51:43] even have time to begin to approach it
[1:51:45] but all of us preachers like to preach
[1:51:46] about prayer life and you know why
[1:51:48] because us included we don't do enough
[1:51:50] of it right amen it's not to preach
[1:51:53] about your prayer life so that we can
[1:51:54] make you feel miserable because it's so
[1:51:56] miserable but it's because ours is all
[1:51:59] so so miserable right it's because we
[1:52:02] want to pray more but the busyness of
[1:52:04] Life sits in the things of Life the time
[1:52:07] that's right but brothers and sisters he
[1:52:09] knows what we you know I I've tried to
[1:52:13] alter the way I approach the word here
[1:52:16] in the end time if I can believe that
[1:52:17] scripture that says he already knows
[1:52:20] what we have need of before we ask right
[1:52:23] then what's all the asking about right I
[1:52:25] hear people pray and they rehearse the
[1:52:27] whole week before the Lord well Lord do
[1:52:29] you know that that that that sister
[1:52:31] Sally said that about me well he knew
[1:52:33] that already don't need to tell the Lord
[1:52:36] about that and you know that brother
[1:52:38] brother Carl you know what he said about
[1:52:39] me this week and and and you know lord
[1:52:42] well yes he knows all of
[1:52:44] that and he knows your need before you
[1:52:47] even ask that's right and he will
[1:52:48] provide the
[1:52:51] Brothers the the the the the days of
[1:52:54] that's what I say about Jimmy Swagger
[1:52:55] and all of his fundraising and whoever
[1:52:57] it may be I'm not picking on him you may
[1:52:59] be a Jimmy Swagger fan I hope not but
[1:53:01] you may be right if you are I'd like to
[1:53:03] speak with you after the
[1:53:05] meeting downstairs amen while we share a
[1:53:08] hot dog I would like to talk to you
[1:53:10] about that I hope you're not but all the
[1:53:13] fundraising all the asking all the
[1:53:15] begging right all the Bible selling all
[1:53:19] the Expositor Study Bible that he can
[1:53:21] pump out is to build a false Kingdom
[1:53:24] right right on a false
[1:53:26] word the Lord knows what we need if if
[1:53:29] if if the need of a true son and isn't
[1:53:33] it wonderful in our lives as we look
[1:53:35] back through 2011 and all the things
[1:53:37] that God did for us can't you remember
[1:53:40] the Most Blessed times was when God did
[1:53:42] things for us to take care of a need
[1:53:45] before we KN knew even the need was
[1:53:47] there is that amazing have you had those
[1:53:49] experiences where all of a sudden
[1:53:51] something happens and then you realize
[1:53:53] tomorrow why that happened it was
[1:53:55] because I was going to need this the
[1:53:57] answer was already provided and then the
[1:53:59] need showed up amen your jobs brothers
[1:54:02] and sisters it's not to just make you go
[1:54:03] out and toil and labor right it's to
[1:54:06] provide for a need that'll be out there
[1:54:07] ahead you get a little windfall
[1:54:09] something good happen in your business
[1:54:11] in your job somebody gives you an extra
[1:54:14] 20 bucks just out of the blue you may
[1:54:16] need that tomorrow right I like
[1:54:18] something brother Perry green said one
[1:54:19] time you know brother Bram tried to give
[1:54:21] him a piece of money brother green said
[1:54:23] I I heard him tell this story he said I
[1:54:25] don't want it brother Bram and no I want
[1:54:26] you to have this brother green was like
[1:54:28] no brother brand he drove him somewhere
[1:54:30] or something and he said no I don't want
[1:54:32] this money and again he tried to give it
[1:54:34] to him brother green finally gave up and
[1:54:36] he said brother brand if you're telling
[1:54:38] me that I'm going to need this money
[1:54:40] tomorrow then I'm going to take
[1:54:42] it but he said I don't want to just take
[1:54:45] it for the sake of taking it but if
[1:54:46] you're telling me that I need to take
[1:54:48] this money right and sure enough it
[1:54:50] turned out that way there was a need
[1:54:52] that showed up and it was provided
[1:54:54] right I believe that's the kind of Lord
[1:54:57] that we're
[1:54:58] serving we'll be like trees planted by
[1:55:00] the rivers of the Water of Life Jesus
[1:55:03] knows how to feed us brothers and
[1:55:05] sisters whatever whatever struggles this
[1:55:08] church will go through in
[1:55:10] 2012 I don't I don't guess y'all have
[1:55:12] any we have a couple at home you know
[1:55:14] they show up every once in a while
[1:55:15] Church struggles y sure well
[1:55:20] you don't mean our church I mean every
[1:55:22] church I mean every Church what happens
[1:55:25] why do you think brother Bram need to
[1:55:26] warn us about a man will come in among
[1:55:28] you and he'll sit among you for a long
[1:55:29] time he'll be real nice and love and
[1:55:31] everything's going good and all of a
[1:55:32] sudden y he'll begin to move around
[1:55:34] things go bad and we throw up our hands
[1:55:36] and say it must not be a good church no
[1:55:38] it's we've already been told that's
[1:55:39] going to happen right but God will take
[1:55:42] care of that right amen he's kept you
[1:55:45] this far the work that has been started
[1:55:48] in you he will perform it right until
[1:55:50] the end and that's the consolation we
[1:55:52] have in going into
[1:55:54] 2012 he will take care of God knows how
[1:55:58] to feed his children we sing a little
[1:56:00] song There Lord feed your children as we
[1:56:02] stand here willing to Feast from the
[1:56:05] table of life right don't you feel that
[1:56:07] way tonight Lord we are willing to feed
[1:56:09] just let that hunger stay there don't
[1:56:12] let me ever get S I know we sing I am
[1:56:14] satisfied satisfied with Jesus and that
[1:56:17] and that's also a paradox
[1:56:20] being satisfied with Jesus doesn't leave
[1:56:22] you sitting at home on Sunday on your
[1:56:24] couch I don't need to go down to church
[1:56:27] because I am satisfied I'm satisfied
[1:56:29] with Jesus yeah well you're miserably
[1:56:32] satisfied if that be the case because
[1:56:35] you're not following what the word says
[1:56:37] it will be your cond the word brother
[1:56:40] brand said if you're a real Christian
[1:56:41] you can't wait for the doors to open
[1:56:43] there's something in you that draws you
[1:56:45] down there exactly I'm afraid too many
[1:56:48] people are satisfied they're just
[1:56:50] they're just happy with what they got
[1:56:51] right amen Lord let that hungry there's
[1:56:54] so much word about this so many
[1:56:56] scriptures we could look at Jesus knows
[1:56:58] how to feed his own right right let's
[1:57:01] let's close I I won't take much longer I
[1:57:03] do want to go to one more area because I
[1:57:05] won't have time to do this tomorrow but
[1:57:07] in John chapter 6 if you'll turn over
[1:57:11] there I know you got a little time still
[1:57:13] to feel I'd like to go over this just
[1:57:15] quickly with
[1:57:17] you few more quotes few more vers vers
[1:57:19] and
[1:57:25] we this is real familiar I want to just
[1:57:30] talk a couple of minutes about the
[1:57:31] feeding of the 5,000 people you know I
[1:57:34] believe the Lord knows how to feed us
[1:57:35] and believe knows believe he knows how
[1:57:38] to take care of the need after these
[1:57:39] things Jesus Went Over the Sea of
[1:57:41] Galilee which is the Sea of tab a great
[1:57:43] multitude followed
[1:57:45] him because they saw his miracles which
[1:57:47] he did on them that were diseased he
[1:57:49] went up into the mountain sat with his
[1:57:52] disciples the Passover a feast of the
[1:57:54] Jews was n when Jesus lifted up his eyes
[1:57:57] he saw great company he said unto them
[1:57:59] Phillip whence shall we buy bread that
[1:58:01] these may eat this he said to prove him
[1:58:04] for he himself knew what he would do
[1:58:06] Philip answered him 200 penny worth of
[1:58:07] bread is not sufficient that every one
[1:58:10] of them may take a little one of his
[1:58:12] disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother
[1:58:15] said there's a lad here which got five
[1:58:17] barley loaves two small fishes but what
[1:58:19] they among so many and Jesus said make
[1:58:21] the men sit down there was much grass in
[1:58:22] the place the men sat down in number
[1:58:25] about 5,000 Jesus Took the Loaves and
[1:58:28] when he had given thanks he distributed
[1:58:29] to the disciples the Disciples of them
[1:58:31] that were set down and likewise of the
[1:58:33] fishes as much as they would and when
[1:58:35] they were filled he said unto his
[1:58:37] disciples gather up the fragments that
[1:58:40] remain and nothing be lost therefore
[1:58:41] they gathered them together filled 12
[1:58:43] baskets with the fragments of the five
[1:58:45] barley loaves which remained above over
[1:58:48] and above unto them that had eaten those
[1:58:52] men when they had seen the miracle that
[1:58:53] Jesus did said this is of a truth that
[1:58:56] Prophet that should come into the world
[1:58:58] and we know later on Jesus said you
[1:58:59] follow me just simply because I fed you
[1:59:01] your fathers did eat Mana in the
[1:59:03] wilderness and they're dead right but
[1:59:05] what a miracle it was 5,000 men sitting
[1:59:08] on the grass by companies one one of
[1:59:10] those gospels
[1:59:11] call you know you you you Pentecostal
[1:59:14] people know that if there was 5,000 men
[1:59:17] how many women and children were there
[1:59:20] exactly thousands thousand fed them all
[1:59:22] with Five Loaves and two fishes and and
[1:59:25] I just love some of I just want to read
[1:59:26] you a couple of quotes what brother R
[1:59:28] said about that and I hope it gives you
[1:59:30] some courage
[1:59:32] amen he was talking
[1:59:35] about a paradox here's your Paradox it
[1:59:37] was a it was a paradox when a carpenter
[1:59:40] Son by the name of Jesus Took up five
[1:59:42] biscuits two fish and he fed 5,000
[1:59:45] people if it isn't I want to see
[1:59:47] somebody do it today I want you to EXP
[1:59:49] explain to me right what kind of an adom
[1:59:52] he let loose you know how often he said
[1:59:54] that that's a common expression yes sir
[1:59:56] that's brother BR what did he do not
[1:59:57] only the fish but the fish was growed
[1:59:59] the fish was scaled the fish was clean
[2:00:02] the fish was cooked the fish was
[2:00:03] whatever it was the bread was planted
[2:00:05] and grow Y and notice this part and all
[2:00:08] of it bypassed God turned it from cook
[2:00:11] fish to cook fish he just growed it out
[2:00:14] and broke it off and he growed it out
[2:00:16] and he broke it off and he growed it out
[2:00:18] until he fed 5,000 amen what does that
[2:00:21] routine mean break it off grow it out
[2:00:24] break it off grow it out feed grow it
[2:00:26] out that means he is the same yesterday
[2:00:29] today that's right he is the same God
[2:00:32] that was he is still the bread of life
[2:00:34] to any man that's hungering and
[2:00:35] thirsting you can't exhaust his goodness
[2:00:39] what does that routine mean break it off
[2:00:41] grow it out he's the same yesterday
[2:00:43] forever amen in a message call calling
[2:00:45] Jesus on the scene he said it might have
[2:00:47] been young John that said you know what
[2:00:49] I'll tell you what made it real to me
[2:00:51] was that day when he broke the bread we
[2:00:53] was all hungry we had went out into the
[2:00:54] Wilderness we couldn't find him and
[2:00:56] there we met him all the multitudes come
[2:00:58] around the first thing you know we find
[2:00:59] him saying send them into the city to
[2:01:01] get some food and then he told us to
[2:01:03] feed him and he got five biscuits and
[2:01:05] two little fish and he broke that bread
[2:01:08] and I noticed his hand when he would
[2:01:10] reach back for another piece of bread
[2:01:12] that that biscuit was growed out again
[2:01:15] and then when he reached back and put it
[2:01:16] out in the plate and then he reached
[2:01:18] back that fish was growed out again
[2:01:20] right not only a regular fish but a cook
[2:01:22] fish already growed back again what kind
[2:01:25] of an adom did he turn loose BR cook
[2:01:27] fish cook bread and bypass the growing
[2:01:31] right I'd like another place I'd like to
[2:01:33] ask a scientist or whatever school what
[2:01:34] kind of an atom did he turn loose not
[2:01:37] wheat but wheat was growed and milled
[2:01:39] and shortened and baked and ready to eat
[2:01:41] what did he do and when he broke those
[2:01:43] fishes they were SED and born and raised
[2:01:45] and scaled and cleaned and fried and
[2:01:47] there was a second when he reached for
[2:01:48] it
[2:01:50] he took them five biscuits hey man oh
[2:01:54] brothers and sisters I want to ask this
[2:01:56] this is in Grand Prairie Alberta it is I
[2:01:58] want to ask this congregation what kind
[2:01:59] of anatom did he turn loose right he
[2:02:01] took those little biscuits and he broke
[2:02:03] five of those bed 5,000 people not
[2:02:07] growed wheat sure he bypassed this is
[2:02:10] what brother Rand keeps talking about he
[2:02:12] bypassed right
[2:02:14] bypassed bypassed all the regular
[2:02:16] routines of nature y
[2:02:19] was bypassed right he bypassed
[2:02:22] everything that he talked about turning
[2:02:24] the water into the wine in one place he
[2:02:25] says that water would have eventually
[2:02:27] become wine if it had went down into the
[2:02:29] ground and growed up into the grape and
[2:02:31] it came through the grape and it got
[2:02:32] mashed out it could have become wine but
[2:02:35] he bypassed it right he bypassed the
[2:02:38] regular routine he didn't he didn't
[2:02:41] need in this Resurrection brother you
[2:02:44] know what's going to happen he's going
[2:02:45] to bypass that regular routine right
[2:02:48] amen the trouble within this message
[2:02:50] we've got regular routines for
[2:02:51] everything right come on we got reg
[2:02:54] we're just people of sameness right you
[2:02:57] don't think that's true take somebody's
[2:02:58] seat that's been sitting there for 20
[2:03:01] years come on you say I don't believe
[2:03:04] that brother Tom just go on a man has
[2:03:06] been in that chair for 20 years you go
[2:03:07] in and get his seat on Sunday you'll
[2:03:10] find out if we're not got regular
[2:03:12] routines or
[2:03:13] not right I've seen fist fights nearly
[2:03:17] broke out
[2:03:20] at least star Downs you know yeah right
[2:03:23] you ever see a man that his seat got
[2:03:24] took after sitting there for 20 years
[2:03:27] he'll stand around and Mill around he'll
[2:03:29] go sit in one place and he'll go sit in
[2:03:30] another one just letting the man that's
[2:03:31] in his seat know he ain't comfortable

[2:03:49] before I married my wife I wear the same
[2:03:52] kind of shoes I only have one kind of
[2:03:54] shoes I wear to church and I wore the
[2:03:56] same ones if floram ever quits making

[2:04:16] see praise the Lord there a real man
[2:04:21] another one on the right that's all get
[2:04:23] on my
[2:04:26] hand now my wife will say why don't you
[2:04:28] go looking for some shoes
[2:04:30] why I like these I like these I just go
[2:04:33] get the same thing every time right I
[2:04:37] wear black fuzzy socks we'll just find
[2:04:39] out what else y'all wear black I won't
[2:04:41] take them off but black fuzzy
[2:04:43] sock it's a routine I'm in right I don't
[2:04:47] want blue and black in the drawer
[2:04:48] because you I got to stand there and
[2:04:52] examine come on man right you know what
[2:04:54] I'm talking about we we're people of
[2:04:58] routines it gets that way with church
[2:05:00] sometime but in 2012 maybe we need to
[2:05:03] bust out of the
[2:05:04] routine yes sir if church has gotten
[2:05:06] stale go find another
[2:05:08] seat maybe it'll sound better from the
[2:05:10] left instead of the right mix it
[2:05:14] up bypassing the regular routine right I
[2:05:18] I buy the the same everything I don't
[2:05:20] need to do a lot of shopping right I can
[2:05:23] tell my wife the size and she's seen the
[2:05:25] same shoes for 27 years so you don't
[2:05:28] have to say well these these Allan
[2:05:29] Edmonds over here look good no they
[2:05:31] don't look good at all because my foot
[2:05:33] won't fit in there yeah I don't need to
[2:05:37] look this is what brother BR is talking
[2:05:39] it's a routine the same old routine what
[2:05:42] if God would come along in 2012 getting
[2:05:45] ready to get us out of here and just
[2:05:47] break us out of those routines
[2:05:49] you know what's the trouble with the
[2:05:50] Baptist Church is everybody's got to get
[2:05:52] saved the same way oh oh yeah they got
[2:05:55] to go down the Romans road you know you
[2:05:56] got to stop here and you got to stop
[2:05:58] there and you got to stop there we kind
[2:06:00] of did that with the message we took the
[2:06:01] stature of a perfect message you got to
[2:06:03] have some Faith first then you got to
[2:06:04] have some virtue got to have some
[2:06:06] knowledge got to have some all of those
[2:06:07] things are good but how dare a man get a
[2:06:10] little Temperance before he gets Faith
[2:06:13] yes because he didn't do it in the right
[2:06:14] order did he yeah we had a routine this
[2:06:17] is how it had to be done yeah but
[2:06:20] brothers and sisters the train is about
[2:06:21] to leave the station I mean there may
[2:06:23] not be time that's gory there may not be
[2:06:26] time for people to go through the same
[2:06:27] routine that you and I went through
[2:06:29] right the Lord's took 42 years to get me
[2:06:32] where I am I can't expect the man to
[2:06:33] come in now and catch up unless God does
[2:06:36] something Supernatural for that's right
[2:06:38] man my 42 years don't give me some kind
[2:06:40] of seniority because when a man receives
[2:06:42] this word he's already caught up he
[2:06:45] bypasses the routine we don't have no
[2:06:48] Roman's Road for him to walk down
[2:06:50] righten you know we don't have to have
[2:06:52] him hear life story first yeah y'all
[2:06:55] live through that we used to do that a
[2:06:56] lot give him a t which one you give life
[2:06:58] story well that's going to make him cry
[2:07:00] that's going to break him down yeah that
[2:07:02] may be true why don't you going and just
[2:07:03] start up at the top give him marriage
[2:07:05] and divorce give him serpent
[2:07:07] seed I've seen people come in under that
[2:07:10] what was your first book serpent seed
[2:07:12] that's a good start isn't it that's
[2:07:13] breaking it in gently yeah that's that's
[2:07:16] taking him down the Romans road
[2:07:19] that's easing him right on up into
[2:07:22] it the regular routine the regular
[2:07:25] routine is not going to work in me and
[2:07:27] brother brand said this miracle bypassed
[2:07:29] the regular
[2:07:30] routine bypassed it it it it went it
[2:07:33] went beyond what we've known would work
[2:07:36] y but sometimes even in this message we
[2:07:38] get in our mind this will work and then
[2:07:40] this will work and we got to do this and
[2:07:42] brother you need to do that well how do
[2:07:43] you know I need well that's the way I
[2:07:44] did it so that's why I know you got to
[2:07:46] do it that way but it B pass the regular
[2:07:49] routine break it off feed it out right
[2:07:51] break it off feed it out there's one
[2:07:53] thing I want to point out to you I I
[2:07:54] promise I'm going to let yall
[2:07:57] sing I looked through all these quotes
[2:07:59] where brother Ram talked about that
[2:08:01] miracle I looked at all the descriptions
[2:08:04] that he gave of the bread and the fish
[2:08:08] and you know what I found
[2:08:09] out is that sometimes brother brandom
[2:08:13] said that it was talking about that fish
[2:08:15] he said you and you know before I say
[2:08:18] this read these to you quickly let me
[2:08:20] just say this you know on the day of
[2:08:22] Pentecost if you remember there was all
[2:08:24] those people there and every man was
[2:08:26] hearing it in his own language remember
[2:08:28] that we always said well that was the
[2:08:29] tongue but it wasn't the tongue it was
[2:08:31] the
[2:08:32] hearing and and all those nationalities
[2:08:34] there was 17 different nationalities
[2:08:35] sitting there that heard it in their own
[2:08:37] language and that was the miracle right
[2:08:40] right when when brother Brenham
[2:08:42] described this bread and this fish that
[2:08:44] was broke off from that loaf and from
[2:08:46] that original one he gave it a lot of
[2:08:48] different
[2:08:49] descriptions he called
[2:08:51] [Music]
[2:08:52] it he says the fish he took those fishes
[2:08:56] and he broke them they were not just
[2:08:59] raised up another fish out of the water
[2:09:00] but he broke a fish another piece growed
[2:09:03] on while he was breaking that one a
[2:09:05] fried
[2:09:06] fish a fried fish rolled in cornmeal and
[2:09:10] fried ready to eat yep and he talked
[2:09:15] about the bread it was baked he says not
[2:09:17] just wiggling fish cook fish what kind
[2:09:19] of an adom remember 5,000 people out of
[2:09:21] the two fish took those spell and broke
[2:09:23] it off every time he'd break it off
[2:09:25] another piece would be grow on cooked
[2:09:27] fish already cooked I like this
[2:09:29] description fried and
[2:09:32] crisco that's a that's a good one that
[2:09:35] my favorite of
[2:09:36] all he said ready to go what a person
[2:09:39] I'll break off wheat and go cook it but
[2:09:41] the not the regular procedure but he
[2:09:43] could bypass all of that right just
[2:09:45] break off cooked bread and hand it out
[2:09:47] with brown crust on it
[2:09:49] it every time he broke a piece of bread
[2:09:51] off no sooner than his hand left there
[2:09:53] was another piece of bread
[2:09:55] there on and on he he he talks about the
[2:09:58] fish he said I watched his hands talking
[2:10:01] about John giving that testimony I was
[2:10:02] standing near each time I come to the
[2:10:04] basket I seen him take up a piece of
[2:10:06] biscuit and break off a chunk of it
[2:10:07] reach back and break out another piece
[2:10:09] he was young he says I just can't
[2:10:10] understand how there was more baked
[2:10:12] bread if he if if he would have had an
[2:10:14] oven and baked it he had wheat I might
[2:10:16] have understood it but he didn't he
[2:10:17] bypassed procession the regular natural
[2:10:20] run of raising the wheat and grinding it
[2:10:22] and milling and sifting it and
[2:10:24] shortenings and salt and seasoning and
[2:10:27] he put it in the oven and breaking it
[2:10:29] don't you see his brother ROM described
[2:10:31] this fish he said one place it was fried
[2:10:34] in Crisco in another place he says not
[2:10:37] only wheat and milk that goes into the
[2:10:38] bread but it was already growed and
[2:10:40] baked and ready to serve every time he
[2:10:41] reached his hand for it there it was it
[2:10:43] was a new loaf he just broke a part of
[2:10:46] it off and handed out reach back and
[2:10:48] there was another Herring already cooked
[2:10:51] he growed that Herring fattened him up
[2:10:52] and boiled him
[2:10:54] right wait a minute just a few minutes
[2:10:56] ago it was fried fish fried in Crisco
[2:10:59] rolled in cornmeal and fried and now
[2:11:02] he's saying he's reached back grabbed
[2:11:04] that hair and fatten him up and boiled
[2:11:05] him and baked him and had him
[2:11:07] ready every time he get a biscuit he'd
[2:11:10] just say here biscuit grow back at Grand
[2:11:11] and here you are amen all I'm trying to
[2:11:15] say to you is brother Rand described
[2:11:17] that Miracle sometimes the fish was
[2:11:18] boiled right sometimes it was baked amen
[2:11:22] sometimes it was fried in Crisco right
[2:11:24] and my only point to you is this if on
[2:11:26] the day of Pentecost every man could
[2:11:27] hear in his own language as those
[2:11:31] disciples was handing out that fish
[2:11:32] couldn't a man have fish to his own
[2:11:37] liking let's make the miracle a little
[2:11:40] bigger if we
[2:11:41] can I can hear Andrew walking along
[2:11:44] bfish got bfish I don't know who would
[2:11:46] want that but I got B
[2:11:49] here comes Peter with his basket fried
[2:11:51] and
[2:11:52] crisco and every man in the eating it
[2:11:55] tasted to his own life can you believe
[2:11:59] because brother brand took so much time
[2:12:01] describing all these different ways it
[2:12:03] was fixed in different messages gold
[2:12:05] baked fried and
[2:12:07] crisco I believe the miracle was this
[2:12:09] brothers and sisters if God is going to
[2:12:11] feed you he's going to feed you with
[2:12:12] what you like he's going to give you
[2:12:15] something that is palatable to your
[2:12:17] taste if you like it boiled you're going
[2:12:19] to get it boiled if you like it fried
[2:12:21] you're going to get it fried if you like
[2:12:23] it baked you're going to get it baked if
[2:12:25] you like it blacken he didn't use
[2:12:27] blacken but I'm sure it was blacken
[2:12:30] right however those people were feeding
[2:12:34] they were feeding to their own
[2:12:36] satisfaction amen glory and that's all
[2:12:38] I've got to say to you about this
[2:12:40] message this message
[2:12:43] comes and it feeds you sir amen oh I
[2:12:48] know I know what you're going to I know
[2:12:49] you're all thinking with me you're going
[2:12:50] to the Book of Revelation and John says
[2:12:52] I ate the book and it was bitter in my
[2:12:54] belly but it tasted pretty good going on
[2:12:57] it was sweet in my mouth like honey but
[2:13:00] it was bitter in my belly why because he
[2:13:03] brother said he had to go out and live
[2:13:04] the word now but when God feeds his
[2:13:07] children he brings you a word that you
[2:13:10] can go home and you don't have to spit
[2:13:12] it out the car window on the way home
[2:13:14] because it tasted good what does the
[2:13:17] scripture tell us tast and see that the
[2:13:19] Lord is because why it's a taste it's an
[2:13:22] acquired taste that's tailor made to you
[2:13:26] tailor made right if you like it boiled
[2:13:29] it's going to come across boiled if you
[2:13:31] like it fried it's going to come fried
[2:13:33] if you like it baked it's going to come
[2:13:34] across bre because why God feeds his
[2:13:37] children right and when he's done he had
[2:13:40] 12 baskets left exactly you know why
[2:13:42] there was 12 because there was 12 people
[2:13:44] going to walk away with those baskets
[2:13:46] which provided tomorrow's food for him
[2:13:48] all day long exactly oh brothers and
[2:13:50] sisters that's our God that's our God
[2:13:52] that we're serving that's what he did
[2:13:54] for us in 2011 right oh but we just we
[2:13:58] just got our taste buds all messed up
[2:14:00] that's all we need to be praying for is
[2:14:01] Lord fix our taste buds we want it to be
[2:14:04] sweet in our mouth I know sometimes you
[2:14:07] got a little Limestone mixed in there
[2:14:09] with it yeah you know what brother
[2:14:11] brandom said he said them Shepherds and
[2:14:13] sheep would get sick and they needed to
[2:14:14] get limestone in them so what would they
[2:14:16] do they'd smear the honey on the rock
[2:14:18] right and as the Sheep licked the honey
[2:14:20] he licked off the Limestone too and he
[2:14:22] got well amen oh there's honey in the RO
[2:14:25] brother's Honey in the Rock for you God

[3:32:34] me I I I just can't I
[3:32:38] forget maybe it's best I did to get
[3:32:42] that i' done it one time a bunch of
[3:32:45] couple of preachers hadn't been to a
[3:32:46] fellowship meeting in 3 or 4 months and
[3:32:50] it goes I a mar marri a wife bought me a
[3:32:56] cow got Ox to
[3:33:00] plow goes on like that you know I cannot
[3:33:04] come I canot come to the
[3:33:09] wedding
[3:33:13] we're going to pass on
[3:33:16] that they're turning it off over Y in
[3:33:20] India and Africa after

[3:33:28] it swapped
[3:33:31] up you could get it swapped around a
[3:33:33] little bit and start I bought a wife and
[3:33:34] Mar the
[3:33:36] C it would really mess everything up you
[3:33:39] know put you in the wrong
[3:33:41] we got about 5 minutes you know
[3:33:46] so you know I I've always been one of
[3:33:49] the kind I guess
[3:33:51] brother Tom wonder why I didn't get up
[3:33:53] behind him to say a lot I I don't I
[3:33:55] don't preach I have preachers preach
[3:33:57] that's that's always been my way I just
[3:34:00] don't do it uh I'll talk about what to
[3:34:03] say or something like that but and I've
[3:34:05] always wanted it to be what they say you
[3:34:07] know they brought the message and you
[3:34:10] always tell somebody get up behind you
[3:34:12] you know and you can say well well that
[3:34:14] fell didn't agree with me cuz what he
[3:34:16] said you know and there's ways of
[3:34:18] sliding your words in to make it all
[3:34:21] clear up you know and all this that and
[3:34:23] the other but I just never believed in
[3:34:25] it because it it doesn't work out to me
[3:34:28] it's just it's the the wrong approach
[3:34:31] and things musicians can go ahead and
[3:34:34] and but I really enjoyed the message and
[3:34:37] I appreciate it looking forward to
[3:34:39] tomorrow and and to hear you know
[3:34:41] because I I I do firmly believe that we
[3:34:44] do need to hunger and
[3:34:46] thirst and that thirst inside of us is
[3:34:49] is a great thing thirsting for this
[3:34:52] message to hear
[3:34:53] it you know as our brother was bringing
[3:34:57] it was a good way too that you know we
[3:35:00] try to make it around here brother Tom
[3:35:02] on one basis that
[3:35:05] uh we try to preach one thing and that's
[3:35:08] to live
[3:35:09] Christ let it be life amen let it be
[3:35:13] what you live the prophet said you can
[3:35:17] shout all you want to we said when you
[3:35:20] come down you be better be able to walk
[3:35:23] straight but if you don't then you Shou
[3:35:26] is not worth a whole lot we may not put
[3:35:28] a lot of emphasis into the emotional
[3:35:31] realm here and and all but we're not dry
[3:35:35] because we we just sit and listen and
[3:35:38] you know a loaded wagon doesn't make a
[3:35:40] lot of r bracket it's an empty wagon
[3:35:42] that clares and Bs a lot but I just I
[3:35:46] love the word of the Lord and I I just
[3:35:48] appreciate God over the years of what
[3:35:50] he's done for us
[3:35:51] here that we started here July the 4
[3:35:55] 1971 and we've been going ever
[3:35:58] since preaching the gospel and now it's
[3:36:00] going around the world by way of
[3:36:03] internet going out to people that can
[3:36:06] hear man today and Guyana called and he
[3:36:09] said I want
[3:36:11] takes all right we'll get them to you as
[3:36:13] quick as we can CU you know but we just
[3:36:17] appreciate God for what he's been able
[3:36:19] to
[3:36:20] do he's been able to put this message
[3:36:22] around the world into the hands you may
[3:36:25] not agree with what this group of people
[3:36:27] does or what that group of people does
[3:36:29] or what this group or
[3:36:31] whatever but if you're trying to get the
[3:36:33] gospel out Paul said one day he said no
[3:36:35] matter if Christ is preached by
[3:36:38] [Music]
[3:36:39] contention look words
[3:36:42] arguing he said I Glory you know
[3:36:46] why because somebody standing by my your
[3:36:50] Christ where they could have never heard
[3:36:52] him before or his name mentioned or
[3:36:55] didn't talk about like he was talking
[3:36:57] about Paul there he was with
[3:37:01] Sten that just burdened on Paul's
[3:37:04] heart and even after he got converted I
[3:37:07] believe it was a greater burden than it
[3:37:09] was before yes he wanted to die
[3:37:13] right he was warned even by the Holy
[3:37:15] Spirit not to go to Rome now you come
[3:37:19] you you study that one out that a man
[3:37:21] went to Rome and wrote the biggest
[3:37:24] portion of his writings come from Rome
[3:37:26] and we have them in our Bible but even
[3:37:28] the Holy Spirit warned him that you're
[3:37:31] going to it's going to happen to you if
[3:37:32] you go PA said I don't want to go I'm
[3:37:35] willing I'm I'm going ain't nowhere to
[3:37:37] stop me cuz he was a Roman citizen
[3:37:41] he had his his nationality as a Roman
[3:37:44] citizen and he could have refused to to
[3:37:47] let them
[3:37:48] crucify yet he wanted to die yes why
[3:37:52] because he'd seen what he'd
[3:37:54] done the life that he had been and the
[3:37:57] things against the gospel and he so
[3:37:59] wanted to give his life for the gospel
[3:38:02] well I think that's all it needs for any
[3:38:04] of us
[3:38:06] right but around stated how many times
[3:38:08] he said God
[3:38:11] died that we might
[3:38:14] live he said now let us
[3:38:17] die that he might live am right to carry
[3:38:21] this message to your neighbors to you
[3:38:23] you don't have to go down to the
[3:38:24] neighbors and knock on the door I want
[3:38:26] to tell you about the prophet just live
[3:38:28] it before you know what eventually
[3:38:31] they'll come around want to know a
[3:38:32] little bit about it then you can start
[3:38:35] talking to them about the things and
[3:38:37] telling them the truth but mainly just
[3:38:39] tell them how you your fire got
[3:38:42] lit you know you just tell them a little
[3:38:45] about about your life what it's done for
[3:38:47] you you
[3:38:49] know and then doing that then like I
[3:38:53] heard a person tell one time
[3:38:55] said that it was such a change in the
[3:38:57] person's life said I wanted to be like
[3:38:59] it well that's right right you know in
[3:39:01] Fox's book of Martyrs that a lot of
[3:39:03] those Roman
[3:39:05] soldiers when they were taking them down
[3:39:07] to feed them to the lines and thing you
[3:39:08] know what they just throw their stuff
[3:39:10] down walked right in with
[3:39:12] them they seen something
[3:39:15] real and they wanted to be part of
[3:39:18] it they just walked right in there with
[3:39:21] it a live life is the greatest thing
[3:39:24] that could ever
[3:39:25] be new year's resolution you're going to
[3:39:27] break
[3:39:29] them but make a resolution in your heart
[3:39:32] as we end this year
[3:39:34] up that we'd wind up in a New Year have
[3:39:38] a wonderful time I always look forward
[3:39:42] I I I'm glad this has lasted and gone 40
[3:39:46] something years since the prophet has
[3:39:47] gone because just let all as her brother
[3:39:49] was saying all of them things is run all
[3:39:52] over you know and let everything
[3:39:55] astray is supposed to be
[3:39:59] yes but you know the little bride she
[3:40:01] comes right down through the middle of
[3:40:02] all of it she gets it she's thirsting
[3:40:06] and you know it's not far the others
[3:40:09] then
[3:40:10] it's only for those that are hungering
[3:40:12] and
[3:40:14] thirsty in their heart for the word of
[3:40:16] the
[3:40:18] Lord and now after there are celebrating
[3:40:20] let's just stand we read our scripture
[3:40:24] go into the communion we be in the new
[3:40:26] year now some watches may be a little
[3:40:28] different but we're close to it that's
[3:40:30] why always let it roll over a minute or
[3:40:32] something but we're in the new
[3:40:35] year you know they say according to what
[3:40:38] is it the uh asex one other of them one
[3:40:41] of them Maya say that this is the last
[3:40:44] calendar year they
[3:40:46] wrote well so what and ain't going to
[3:40:50] put us in the Rapture that's
[3:40:53] right knowing all about those
[3:40:56] things what good is it that's
[3:40:59] right rapturing Faith lays in this Bible
[3:41:03] yes and brought out of this Bible
[3:41:05] through a prophet's message so then it
[3:41:07] lays in the prophet's message where on a
[3:41:10] five-fold Ministry to pick that up out
[3:41:14] of the message and take it to the Ley
[3:41:18] and then the Ley to make it manifest and
[3:41:20] let them take it to the world right
[3:41:23] sheep is what beget
[3:41:25] sheep Shepherds don't beget
[3:41:28] sheep sheep beget sheep so take the
[3:41:31] message to the world take it to your
[3:41:33] neighbors I want to say you don't have
[3:41:35] to go I wanton to talk to you about
[3:41:36] brother R was prophet
[3:41:38] no they don't need to being
[3:41:41] foolish but if they give you a little
[3:41:43] chance just start talking am brother
[3:41:46] random says just talk about the
[3:41:50] weather he said if there a car salesman
[3:41:52] or something just talk about selling
[3:41:53] cars said in a little bit you said the
[3:41:56] Lord's good you know now I'm
[3:41:58] paraphrasing it but he said you know if
[3:42:01] they pick it up said then you can carry
[3:42:02] it on yes and talk to them about the
[3:42:06] Lord just be led be s
[3:42:11] and you know what I like to
[3:42:13] remember I like to talk to somebody else
[3:42:16] trying to help them the way I
[3:42:19] remember the way it was brought to
[3:42:24] me if it was delivered to me in the
[3:42:27] right manner let me deliver it in the
[3:42:29] right
[3:42:32] manner is delivered to me right here
[3:42:34] from the
[3:42:36] word the man said what does the word
[3:42:38] say
[3:42:40] I said well that's right I can't argue
[3:42:43] the word
[3:42:45] right but I want it revealed don't
[3:42:47] you let's read our scripture we're in
[3:42:50] the New Year great time looking
[3:42:53] forward to the wonderful works of God in
[3:42:56] the change of this body to walk off of
[3:42:59] this Earth without having to die you
[3:43:02] know somebody's going to be that so why
[3:43:04] can't we contend with
[3:43:08] that everybody in the Bible ever
[3:43:10] amounted to anything it was when the
[3:43:12] word was revealed personally to
[3:43:15] them and then they just walked
[3:43:20] out Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11
[3:43:24] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[3:43:27] which also I delivered unto you that the
[3:43:29] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[3:43:31] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[3:43:33] given thanks he break it and said take
[3:43:35] eat this is my body which is broken for
[3:43:37] you this do in remembrance of me
[3:43:40] after the same man also he took the cup
[3:43:42] when he had s saying this cup is the New
[3:43:45] Testament in my blood this do ye as
[3:43:48] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[3:43:50] me for as often as you eat this bread
[3:43:53] and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's
[3:43:55] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[3:43:57] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[3:43:59] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[3:44:01] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[3:44:04] let a man examine himself and so let him
[3:44:06] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[3:44:08] he didn't say now examine yourself and
[3:44:10] then just go eat you examine yourself
[3:44:13] you straighten it
[3:44:15] up right amen examine yourself you find
[3:44:19] something you straighten it
[3:44:21] up then you go to the table then you go
[3:44:25] with it say it's not you well I I've
[3:44:27] examined myself no for he that eateth
[3:44:30] and drinketh unworthily eateth and
[3:44:31] drinketh Damnation to himself not
[3:44:34] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[3:44:36] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[3:44:37] and many sleep for we would would judge
[3:44:40] ourselves we should not be judged I love
[3:44:42] this scripture but when we are judged we
[3:44:46] are chasen to the Lord that we should
[3:44:48] not be condemned with the world
[3:44:50] wherefore my brethren when you come
[3:44:52] together to eat Terry one for another
[3:44:54] and if any man hunger let him meat at
[3:44:56] home that you come not together under
[3:44:59] condemnation the rest will I sit in
[3:45:01] order when I come yes what about a man
[3:45:04] as I say in the other day out of all of
[3:45:07] the
[3:45:08] things
[3:45:10] why was not Peter chosen to write to
[3:45:12] tell us about the communion why wasn't
[3:45:15] John chosen we call John The
[3:45:18] Eagle right why was not he
[3:45:22] chosen to tell us about the
[3:45:24] communion one born out of due
[3:45:29] season come to tell us about it right
[3:45:32] the Apostle Paul then one born out of
[3:45:35] due season in the last days come to
[3:45:37] explain it more into deep detail of what
[3:45:40] Paul was talking about so he said when
[3:45:43] you do this see in the Corinthians they
[3:45:45] coming together having communion but
[3:45:47] they was eating supper they was having
[3:45:49] you know drunk and everything probably
[3:45:52] cuz they drank wine and things and he
[3:45:54] said don't do it that
[3:45:58] way it's not supposed just to be eating
[3:46:00] a meal or something it's a
[3:46:06] Sol and then to come to find out you
[3:46:08] know I used to when I bad and thing we
[3:46:10] talked about the the marriage supper you
[3:46:13] know going to eatting and all we
[3:46:16] wondered what that would be that Prophet
[3:46:18] one day when he said it he said it's
[3:46:21] going to be the
[3:46:23] communion I thought beans and ters and
[3:46:26] all tomatoes and Cal down the
[3:46:28] drink we're going to take
[3:46:33] communion that's going to be a wonderful
[3:46:37] communion we've seen people healed take
[3:46:40] communion
[3:46:43] heal see because it really means
[3:46:46] something he said well it's just a just
[3:46:48] an example but it's a wonderful example
[3:46:51] right amen so let's just take a few
[3:46:54] moments of Silent prayer praying one for
[3:46:56] another and the prophet said you pray
[3:46:57] for your pastor your pastor prays for
[3:47:00] you let's do this and then we'll go into
