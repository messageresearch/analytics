========================================

everybody change your service if I can share something real quick I was going to the uh in the facility or work those two maintenance departments and if you've ever been around Maine this is probably getting him though they're a different breed of people different attitudes and look out some life and making the most money I went through there singing praising God just walking to the other shop somebody yelled at with some certain words what are you so happy about I just kept walking singing went back what I was gonna do and I come walking back out yelled it again at me and that's what I tell you what I'm happy about it I said it's the nature it's in me and it ain't me I'm just praise the Lord I just kept walking but you know it's it kind of excited me and upset things but I was just walking and in the spirit of the lower man singing and hopefully it touched a hard something there but you know you've got to understand work around maintenance people understand how hard that is sometimes would change your service over here now do you want to see it without your power in love foreign and from revelation 6. now remember the Bible study will be the first Saturday in November we'll keep that in mind and come and be with us we're dealing with justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know hadn't got over into some of it but that's what we're dealing with so come and be with us and enjoy the Lord willing next Wednesday the 31st brother Joel Forney will be here with us preaching on Forest so remember that uh Now The Minister's meeting will be the second Saturday in November so remember that to the ministers that want to go with us over to brother Joel Hughes um for the ministers meeting I'll show this the third Saturday will be the fellowship meeting uh brother the Tony's there at Six Flags so remember that I know you already prayed for these but just remember Sister Gayle talk to brother dick a little bit ago and he said that she was really sick and y'all got the old flu bug so I pray that you're watching him tonight and they'll see and and God will heal her just as quick Diaries he would anywhere else I appreciate it appreciate it uh Jackie thank our June's mother for coming to be with us knowing that she's been sick for quite a while so you just keep praying for her yes the Lord would take care of it all right any more announcements I generally miss you did he announced the uh the ones you know for out there marketing for the shower and the different thing so we'll remember those Revelations 1 and revelation 6. Heavenly Father we thank you Lord tonight for your grace and your love others that you have extended unto us and truly you are our father and what a great opportunity to be able to have one to talk to because our father is not only our father he is our savior Our Redeemer are all in all and everything is involved in that and that's what a father is really like we love you and we thank you and we ask you now to just be with us bless the ones that are sick remember Sister Gail their lord just touch her and make your word be what the Arctic word and be healed and let your light shine we ask you to just Open the Eyes of our understanding that we may see you and to all that are watching the service tonight we say shalom because you are our peace we love you and we thank you guide us now in Jesus name amen in Revelations 1 one two three this is the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass he sin and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth what about just a blessing to just be able to read the word of God they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for this time is at hand the time of what time to understand and let's go over to Revelation 6 9-11 and when he had opened the night verse the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they failed and they crowned with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true this thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth and white robes were given unto every one of them it was said unto them that they should rest for a little season until their Feller servants were also and their Brethren should be killed as they were should be fulfilled and then you may be seated the Lord had to bless him to his word now we come up to the park we've hit like a few little messages in doing this like we did Sunday to speak about their Sunday morning about the uh you know kind of reviewing kind of what we had been speaking about in the first four seals and then coming down to a position to talk about that under this fifth seal and I remember under all of the others uh you know you'll find it uh that there was a beast saying come and see the verse 1 going on down verse three uh verse what uh six and then on down to verse seven each one of them is saying a beast is saying come and see all right but then on this fifth seal that we just read now there is no uh announcement messenger there's no combat Beast as we would call it and and we'll get to it in a minute but uh I want you to think on that tonight I tried to to express a lot of the thoughts are Sunday about it that you know uh we don't need another messenger that's right we are in the time of the fourth combat Beast the eagle so we don't need another Messenger to come that's right we need to get into the message that has been brought unto us we need to become that part that we are to be of that combat Beast because it's not just that brother Branham was the combat beast and and we have nothing to do we're supposed to be the part that fits in there and the prophet said when this bride gets a revelation of what she's doing here you know her what she's for and all like that and what's taking place the two Spirits among them and everything and doing those things then when you do he said Satan would be powerless before her that's right you say well I don't know where that'll ever come well that's what the prophet said it was coming so I believe that and that's what I'm looking for time to come when Satan cannot control your thinking and my thinking that we can be set in and associate in with God until no matter what comes or goes good or bad whatever that we just rejoice and say thank you Lord amen because that we have received you know these things all right now no combat Beast to announce I want to say the S and then a little bit I'll come back to it because it's in the message so you don't need one for the field six and seventh because the prophet has come to bring us sebastians all right you agree with that amen now so we don't need another one we don't have to have somebody to come in straighten out the message and the things the message is perfect the one who brought the message sure had thoughts and failures and problems right but he straightened them out and he told us the truth about what was to be and we cannot correct him because he was standing before God you know so we're not trying in any way to correcting or any point because it would be foolishness to do those things you know it'd be foolishness to anybody's mind to say brother random was wrong other than the points that he covered that he was wrong you know like the white horse rider or things like that he told us and he straightened that up now anything else that you're arguing about what good would it be to uh you know argue over because it ain't going to affect us anyway uh I don't even care about listening to it but now what I want you to notice tonight is one thing and then I said I'll come back in the message to it you'll notice there is a thing happening that we've just read and we'll get back and review this in a minute but see each seal one two three four it had symbols right yeah right my horse rider red horse rider black horse rider Pale Horse Rider it had symbols and it would tell about you know the things or the ages that it was in and and that was where the Prophet had become the eagle to express that unto us but if you notice in the fifth and we'll get back to it in the sixth and the seventh there's not a symbol right now I want you to hold that point you're going to say automatically wait a minute there is no no and forever I want to see it right we said well it says dire that you know trolled under the altar that's people right that's not a symbol yeah I know white represented people the black the red you know the pale represented people yeah but that was symbols when you come to this fifth seal there is no symbol right when you come to the Sixth Seal there's no symbol the silent seal is not a symbol all right I want you to put that in your mind and think about it I'm not saying that there's not things there right right that are not understood I'm not saying that now right I'm putting this up front then I'll back up on it again I'm not saying that there's something not something there that needs to be made known that's right right which is not a symbol it says Soldier under the altar now we don't know who that is without the prophet message you're coming to tell us right amen but that's not a symbol that's people all right well then six seal it just says there's an earthquake and all kind of pestilence and I mean it's not any symbol amen amen there's not a symbol at all under the seventh it says silence in heaven for this next half hour now write that down or jot it down and think about it as we go along and then when we come back to it you'll see something begin to unfold that I believe we need to have an understanding of you know in this day and time all right now let's just go back and let's pick up some things that we talked about um Sunday so let's go ahead and win number one I'm going to reread these because it's about three quotes here that we're doing dealing with Sunday but I want you to get a point from it the point is that when you come to this seal there's not an announcement and we're gone that's the two things all right so then there's not anything to be made known to us are you listening under the field sixth and seventh seal there's not anything to be made known to us to redeem us because we've already gone up and I didn't say now that there wasn't anything in there that we need to know about Redemption listen to my wording be somebody out there you're listening to me I know I speak strange and odd but you consider it is not a symbol under that seal right and we're done gone into rapture so this is not to us it's not even about us sure we read it and get from it what we have need of like I said there's Sunday the first four seals shows the Plan of Redemption right in the field six and seventh shows you how he done it amen right then I've encouraged you to read to see a book and to not try to read to find a mystery you're trying to find some secret coded mystery that nobody else did not did you ever see that well yeah all the world said it you know I'm talking about the people in the message like I told you you know you you get into your own sales and when I first time I went to the Tabernacle Club I sat down about 1968 you know and I sat there and I looked up there and there was that cross with uh NRI you know I wrote that down I thought now I found the new name of Jesus I'm gonna come out after the service I said brother mom would you mind explaining something to me anymore I said what is that i n r i there this over the cross from the church what does that mean he said it means Jesus Christ King of the Jews well I raced what I was thinking see I'm human too we're all looking for something instead of looking at it right I'm inviting you to read the steel book again and do not discount what is being said as what we would call a foundation be sealed rattle will speak for quite a while longer on the foundation and he does actually on the seal itself we just want to turn over and get the sealed no the foundation is where the mystery's at the key right because like I've always tried to tell you we'll keep going back over it till you get it the seals is not to the Bride of Jesus Christ the seals take place to Israel after the Rapture the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself and he asked God that's the prophet is that fulfilled the first seal and really over into the seals he said yes well we certainly don't want to be there when that takes place because that according to my understanding would be right about the middle of the right about the time Armageddon sets in all right and he breaks his Covenant we're certainly don't want to be there when the sixth yield tribulation but that seemingly has been so hard to try to get especially ministers right to be able to see that statement we get the revelation of the seals amen we see before we see where it comes from we see where it starts at in Genesis and works its way all the way down through we get the revelation we know what's going to happen in the tribulation but we don't want to be there right even that you know people look at that and they say why what do you mean we're the bride so we got it right here where the Prophet said in the I believe it's in the church's book where he says it it's under the forest seal that the Rapture comes that's exactly right oh but it's foreseen Revelation because it only foreseals dealing with Revelation to you and I right amen not that we can't read field six and seventh and get a mystery from it no that's right but the fifth seal is sold Under The Altar and we know that to be Israel right but maybe we need to think about that a little and consider a few points so now just watch it as we go through and if you would on the fifth seal if you would read from that paragraph 110 through paragraph 199 around 200 there you will find blood around them explaining the combat Beast and explaining like one two three four and what they are and what happens and the things that are taking place under that you know so then you would see it but look what he says now paragraph 81 through 83 1963 322 notice but here when we come to this fifth seal now there's there's no Rider Goes Forth and there's no Beast to announce it it is no Rider no Beast right all right and watch your point to me John said John you he the lamb opened it and John saw it there was no one there to say now come look come see thank you no wonder you might meet no now here's the thing that popped in my mind today as I was thinking on these things that I was thinking that immediately when I say there's no combat Beast under the fifth seal and that there's no symbols then we're going to think that we're the revelated people that can jump up and understand these things that is true but only by way of the Prophet messenger right right everybody get that not our jumbled up minds and our thoughts and ideas and what we believe it is I don't hear what you believe it is or I don't care what I believe it is it's what the word says all right see that we can stand on that part so that would be maybe a thought in somebody's mind but there's no combat beings there's no symbols but remember before the prophet came and spoke on the fifth seal we did not know who those Souls under the altar were right that's right I mean is that true then that leaves us out of it don't it don't get so revelated until we Glory look what we see yeah yeah we see it by way of the Prophet Messenger right right whether you like that or not ice no power of the living creature or theirs and on the sixth eel there's no Beast to announce it and on the Senate seal there's no Beast to announce it no powers to announce yeah see no one does it on the look on them after the fourth seal there's no Announcement by any beast power from the field sixth and seventh not at all all right rolling he said now notice I love this as in the times of the writer of the four horses the writer singular of the four different horses there was a beast to announce the power every time the writers traveled another horse and come forth to ride another kind of a Beast come out and announced it that's a great mystery Steve that is the mystery why announcing the mystery okay why isn't there one here on the fifth seal to announce it and he asked the question why is it throwing you here it is according to the Revelation that the Lord Jesus gave me to Daisy or this morning early I want you and in fact the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time right the time of the fifth seal okay The Mystery of the Antichrist is revealed at this time the Antichrist took these last ride and we found him on the Pale Horse mix with his many colors and rides all the way into prediction we get it on the trumpets and so forth when we teach that I go into it now but we you get pulled off the subject watch it he said I know we're not going to it okay that's the mystery that the church ages had already finished at this time now here's something for you to think of and watch it be perfectly right but you're first going to get the thought that I'm trying to correct no I'm trying to express into sensible terms when the prophet says that this don't happen this is you know Church age had already finished at this time now to take the first verse of chapter nine you know I mean the fifth sixth chapter verse 9. and then take the other verses remember this fifth sealed Jew as we'll get to it later is not the bride of Christ it is Israel as a nation it is not Israel of the 144 000 right now another something there I'm going to hold it it is not the 144 000. right the field sealed view is not and it's not ever Jew right LeBron said it's not these Wall Street bunch it's just money hungry it's only the predestinated are you with me we'll get back on that point a minute but just remember now where does this group come up and are killed for their testimony from Calvary until now right that's the best way to say it so it starts off in the fifth seal that these these who receive white Rogues their manifestation on Earth is during the churches right did that ring a bell when I think about it the time that they're beginning to you know when they're being killed and saying is during the church ages right but there's a part of that fifth seal that doesn't happen in the church ages right they don't get white rose in the church ages there's a part of that seal that's not fulfilled until after we get out of here until now the prophets right right he said these things is after the church is done gone and don't take place during the church ages I mean are you in your mind with automatically they're they're killed during the church hey that's exactly right right that's why it's not a symbol it's a people told under the altar is not a symbol it's a people the secret is to find out who it is not a symbol to find out who that is it's under the altar we know it's Israel as a nation Israel you know but it's not 144 000. we just read the scripture that says this group of people will receive white rose before the 144 000 are killed right pull up back up brother Anderson Revelations where would you read look back to where he was reading Revelations this picture and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw one of the altar that sold of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they hailed we'll get to know and they cry for a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true just thou not judging them into our blood on them that dwell on the earth we'll get to that part later too and white roads were given unto every one of them they're killed in the church ages right with the white robes not in the church yet so the fifth seal is not fully revealed until after we get out of here even what's making manifest on Earth and white roads were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for a little cease yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be full of him that's 144 000. right the 144 000 they're the one is to be killed see when we get out of here or something else is going to take place they're going to receive white Rogue all right we'll get back to that it might be a little contrary to some of our thinking but I just want to get that point no combat Beast because the mystery of the Antichrist also the mystery of Jesus Christ him the bride has been fulfilled at the time that we begin to talk about see the mystery of the church is finished at this time of the fifth seal right whom we just read so now no matter if what you think about it leave the prophets right because this don't take place in the church ages this is after the church ages we just feel seal comes into finality but the people of it started being killed at Calvary right after them the real true Jew now I want to keep pounding that to you not every Jew right but around the emphasize Not That Wall Street bunch is after money and stuff right he's talking about they're not even in the 144 thousand right because out of Israel the whole nation is only 144 000 out of Millions that are there right now is going to be saved in that Park amen so then separated it's not the bride it's not 144 000. it's Israel to be saved as a nation of the promises God gave her now so that starts to unfold look at number two now on you notes Brother Anderson this is paragraph 87. on the fifth seal but the reason that he reveals that I I as I understand it is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the Antichrist being revealed and at the same time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church age at all mushy that's right they're away from the church you need the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of Revelation and does not return until it comes back with his King in 19th Chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be now what would it be for the church age was revealed by these seals and now watch what hey did all right can we go back and we look at the seals and we see that even one two three and four is after we get out of here but they started back under right they've started in Genesis the prophet says it works his way all the way down through all right he said one seal will tie the entire Bible together now he didn't say you had to pick which one right any of them right right I've asked you before you know what is the the seal that's most important to you and people who say oh the seventh you know what I've always said if you don't see the first you don't know what the seventh is Right amen all right so the first seal was a very important important one to me amen amen and I told you when I preached a few weeks ago a month ago or something I didn't connect together the second third and even the fourth in the The Importance part and like it was until the Lord revealed it to me on one seal the tie the entire Bible together because one seal is the revelation of Jesus Christ right amen the Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ that's why we keep reading in Revelation 1. the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John not trinitarianism the message of one true and living God you may make known to you and I in this end time and only to that can you understand the seals and things people come in and all that grab and see a book they read it they know all about to see them I told you what I done I read the seal book after being in the message probably three four five six months and I laid it aside and went back to the church age book because I couldn't get a full comprehension of what he was studying but then one day I begin to come back through and start it on the seals all right but now listen the seals reveal what has been what is and what will be that's Hebrews 13 8 right Jesus Christ was saying yesterday today and forever all right so the CEO starting back you under work their way down that's what I was trying to illustrate with the fifth seal that those Souls under the altar are actually killed during the church ages the time of Calvary to where we are but yet that seal was not fully revealed go to some more things about it amen so the prophet's right when he says the church is gone and isn't even past our time until we get the revelation of it look what he says on this one go ahead number three look what he was saying Gabriel's instruction to Daniel 1961 7 30 in the morning service paragraph 50. and the third chapter of the church was gone up but now Redemption is to be revealed and watch how the church was redeemed all right the revelation of what's taking place during the church age must be revealed to us The Plan of Redemption through the Church of you see the church is gone one after the third chapter so he is now showing in the fifth chapter remember we put service after service in the fifth chapter of Revelation right look what he says now he's showing in the field chapter how he did it what taken place I sealed the church off you remember we kept emphasizing the prophet said enough that the the fifth chapter was a saying for the opening of the seals you remember that that's right need to back up and listen Maybe the fifth chapter how he did it why can't complaints I ain't sealed at church y'all how did he feel the church y'all the revelation of his name water baptism using his name eternal life no eternal hell serpent seed eternal security all the great doctrines predestination of the church that was revealed to the church he's showing how he done it yep right he said but that was before the seals broke sure nothing was a prophet before the seal broke that's right so what takes place now moving number four the Feast of the trumpets preached in 1964 719 the morning series paragraph 36 37. the first three chapters of the Book of Revelation revealed all the happenings of the church then for the third chapter into the 19th Chapter there is no more seen of the church NATO bride right the church goes up at the fourth chapter of Revelation returned back to the 19th Chapter of Revelation the bridegroom together coming into into coming to the Earth and therefore the 19th Chapter on this concludes you've been to the Millennium and the things four to 19 is to Israel all right now and I said I spent 40 years trying to explain that that we do not go into where the seals are broke out because they're broke to Israel even though we are here at the time of Israel being as a nation sealed away in God we are not at the time when they receive their white robes right amen what did he say what did we keep giving number five we give this this quote a lot poor seal night paragraph 194. what Roger pale horses he appeared on his Riders Last Ride he's on his life now now this is not in our day that will be on down it's the seal foretold because see the church has done gone up when this happens all right when they get their white robes go ahead with number six because we're gonna be back on that same scripture but the emphasis on like verse 11 and white roads were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren should get killed as they were should be fulfilled they're giving white robes before Israel is sealed as 144 thousand but the Bible says when I said there's a mystery to this seal it's a great mystery and why God would do it now you remember we got them there you remember the fifth chapter as it said in that fifth chapter but around said it was a scene in the opening of The Seven Seals and we're done gone right you didn't think of that it's a saying he says but we're done God see but we see it that's the scene we see ourselves already in glory in the fifth chapter remember they asked him a question about it he answered the question that all that was that was not the bride and then the Lord corrected him and he answered it back and he said that was the Bride of Jesus Christ unless anybody would like the other paragraph 270 through 274 uh questions and answers on the seals trying to cut down a little bit pull up to number nine now let's start on something we're going to read quite a bit right here and this will be a continual reading for a little bit starting to paragraph 215 and it will go down through paragraph what I'll get to it in a minute I'm going to turn place your stomach where I'm at I'm in here somewhere so we're going to start at 2 15 and we're going to wind up at 228 so that way you can't argue what profit says or not all right paragraph 215. now notice in the ninth verse children under the altar now here's where I'm going to get some real disagreement now you're going to read in your other book and say disagreeing see but this is the upgraded translation I mean that's a very good point just watch just a minute just see I thought that too much I thought that too but it didn't come that way we've I've always thought that these Souls under the altar were the the martyrs of the early church is what he said he thought it was I'm sure that Dr urach Smith and every one of them says it is see but I thought so myself but when the Holy Spirit showed the vision to it are you listening it wasn't it isn't the soul so we saw a vision about the fifth seal that's what he said now you now you say well I I don't know about that well now in just a minute we'll find out so these are not The Souls of the of the Bride church not at all we thought that was the right church wedding that our souls under the altar you see crying how long how long let me read it again now shall we get to it so he goes to the fifth seal reading it and then he comes down and what does he say now for they at for a day at this time if you notice this feels still being open see the church is gone through the bride's gone right it just can't beat it Souls under the yard the early church now now please if if you ever did give this attention now because this is a great controversy so I want you to listen real close now you've got your papers and things to write down now and I want you to notice now these cannot be them Souls because the souls of the righteous modern and righteous people the church the bride has done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the with the bride now watch for they are gone and the Rapture in the fourth chapter of Revelation that was taken up now you see why that it's so important for me to keep driving that down to get your mind one day to where the Holy Spirit can quick and what he's really saved yes but brother so-and-so said it I don't care what he said I don't care what anybody says it's what the prophet had to say that's right we had a meeting first time we run into brother whibley and brother Richard and him we went up to pick up brother Fred Barker and they had a meeting and they were going to have one a week later we went back and met these brothers and when we got there we started talking of something on the seals and and the things and and one of the brothers he said well brother so-and-so said the two witnesses is not going to be killed in 144 000 is not going to be killed don't worry Brothers being yeah I said anybody got a seal block well they produced a seal book but I produced the pages where the Prophet said the two witnesses would be killed and 144 000 to be killed and I said now let's turn in the Bible yeah then we got into the Bible where it says they were to be killed and I said now who are you going to listen to but brother so-and-so told it that way I said I don't care it ain't in the message did he do any good no you're going to get the same point do they better have our so-and-so said than that what the Bible says if that's the way you are out there on the Internet or anybody sitting here then you might as well pack it but he does and go home because we ain't gonna change around here good we don't know who the prophet is and what he came to do and we've got his message you go play around the Foreign Fields where you can't where they don't have a bunch of prophet is talking about because that's what they've done flooded those places with their doctrines listen now who are these Souls then see that's the next thing who are they if they are not near a church and watch what he said this is Israel that's to be saved as a nation all of them that are predestinated that's Israel itself you said oh wait a minute you say they came oh yes they are to be saved here let's just settle in a minute I got four or five scriptures I'll take one let's take Romans just a minute and find out if they are and state in the Book of Romans and go to the Limit chapter Romans will find out just let's just read it then we'll have it by herself Romans the 11th chapter the 25th 26th verse now listen Paul here and Paul said if anyone else even an angel preached any other gospel and what he was then what he was to be cursed what I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of the mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceits there you are the blindness in part is happening to Israel until it's fulfilling fullness of the Gentiles become in all right now blindness to Israel now let me State what I've said over and over you probably said this is Israel as a nation he says not the 144 000 that he's speaking of they will be sealed after we leave out of here these have given their life for the gospel down Through the Ages the testimony that they held for the word of God that they believed this is not ever Jew no more than ever Gentile will be saved this is the predestinated chosen of Israel he said well no did they hear the gospel not necessarily because we're going to read in a minute we're going around and said they stayed with the law and the round said when they landed those airplanes over there the people said those priests you know told them said you're going to fly home on the wings of an eagle he said they've been back up in them countries up there plowing with an old wooden plow now there's really is wrong now watch okay so we get to a point to think on something blindness now to me there's a lot of things that we've got to be considered on that because if you go one way you're going off you go the other way you're going off you keep running it you're going out on a limb either way you go unless you follow the complete channel right through the middle all right if I'm wrong on the if I'm up for correction but what does it mean blindness in part Paul speaking over in the other gospel talks about to this day Israel can't see the truth but because of their heart all right and if they can't see then they must be blind now we're not talking about willful ignorance or blindness you know the foolish version as an example a lot of those people are blinded that if it's even heard the truth I'm trying to give you an example and show what you'll think about it the fullest version is blinded to the truth they can't see what you're talking about because they're Pharisees or Sadducees priests preachers you know has blinded their eyes and you know the Bible said that God would wink at her ignorance but now if you turn down the truth yeah as a gentile you have no hopes whatsoever because you don't get a second change and I want you to get that out of your mind in a hurry that Israel is not dealing God is not dealing with a set of change he's doing exactly what he said he was going to do right amen he's not giving Israel a second chance that's Catholicism we don't make it here maybe we'll make it there that's Catholicism God told us what he was going to do and he done it that's right he blinded his people he said now the religious leaders this those guys are not not the part I'm talking about how they assumed you the religious leaders they blinded themselves to the truth when they were standing there saying if any blood be on us that was probably real good people that haven't even become a to be Soldier under the altar you may be there that day but they were blinded by the false Shepherds just like your foolish virgin brought around and said is what those who never heard the message right or those who were blinded by the false Shepherds and they're foolish virgins and they'll be giving eternal life one day huh well you already got an example to see we're not talking about the the religious leaders that was calling that we're talking about the people that got caught up in that I was telling brother Donnie about it you go down here to Walmart go outside of Walmart and you get your microphone and you start saying they're selling stuff in this place it ain't good you're not even shopping here you want to leave not buy nothing in Walmart anymore you know what you don't gather a crowd right right you know what the crowd's going to be doing and maybe some guy comes up never been in Walmart we ain't going into Walmart because they got plenty of not kill us you draw a crown that's what's in religious leaders done right they draw the crowd and those four old people didn't have the bad kids from the Holy Ghost to know the difference you don't find any of the Apostles standing in that crowd come on because they knew the difference right they were already pre-programmed to know the truth even though they were running and hiding they were not in the crowd flying out for his blood the church if you don't get nothing out of this message tonight you get one thing Israel is the root and offspring of God you and I are grafted in right and then yes we're the bride of Christ the most wonderful of all sure we have accepted Jesus Christ and Israel has turned her down but Israel is the foundation that was God's Nation chosen out of all of the Nations of the world he chose a nation because in dealing with Israel you don't deal with individuals you deal as a nation sure there was a lot of problems in it but just remember one thing even in who was it Balaam trying to curse Israel he got back and looked and saw the hinder Parts the worst things that could be happening in Israel and he said I can't see it then he said all I can see is a atonement that's being made right but get what I'm saying now so don't misunderstand me blindness when you're willfully blinded that's you're sealed away in doomed and there are a lot of Jews that were willfully blinded and they have a place called hell to go to but there's a chosen predestinated group amen of Israel and I emphasize chosen predestinated we want to go through Chosen and predestinated enough Gentiles were called in predestination right right why don't you read the book girl we're Paul's speaking of predestination and see if he ain't talking about Israel just as well as he talking about us right when you're willfully blinded you're lost when you know the truth and won't follow it that's the first seal of iniquity be that North to do good and won't do it right that's where the problem of the people of the message they know better than to come up with all this garbage that they're doing now that brother random was wrong and this and that and the other they're blaspheming the Holy Ghost whether you like those words or not right brother Dave I've heard you say some things about people you talk about I'm talking about you me or anybody that is contrary to the word of God and we know better and won't call her after it we become willfully ignorant blinded blaspheming the Holy Ghost because remember you can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost if you had it right right you can't Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost quotes it's impossible Paul's explaining for you to fall away if you are sealed in by the kingdom of God by the new birth you can't fall away he's not explaining how to fall away he's explaining you can't fall away he said that's Baptist Doctrine nope that ain't once saved always saved that's what's truly Born Again always born again now get my point and say maybe we can continue a thought we turn down this word we are blinded to the word and we have no hope whatsoever because we're not Israel Israel was God's chosen Nation amen I like what that Rabbi Richmond said he said I can't help it if God chose us and I rejoice when you sit down even though the man you know I don't know what he'll be what he can be or whatever could be out of him or what he might be lost and dying go to hell we throw the truth God keep the nation and spent 4 000 years dealing with that Nation you know what I'm talking about it didn't start until over in Abraham and they're coming on down come on get the story but it's 2 000 years of it this God's chosen people right right when he said Abraham you and your seat after you are going to be in an Everlasting Covenant who was the seat of Abraham Israel right and Paul says that their their hearts are blinded to the truth when he said one day it will come off the veil or come off their eyes and they'll be able to see I've got this at the end of the message I think it's a good place to put it when that 144 thousand they see they have rejected their Messiah through the two witnesses right and they'll Realize by their preaching that they have turned down the gospel true and then weep and pull apart because they realize they themselves of the body of Israel had turned against God and crucified him but what about when they come up and see what if God slips a little secret to that hundred and forty four thousand and after you get out of here I'm going to show you something I want to show you my grace I'm going to show you my grace to Israel as a fallen race a nation no wonder they shout and cry in rejoice because they see not only their salvation if they see the opening their seals come on note the opening of the seal show the Israel's Redemption all right come on then they'll not be preached like they don't have to preach one Co two Co three simple not but they tell them the story they'll see that God did blind their people but your eyes are going to come open amen white robes amen amen that's right they'll see that they've been killed down through there martyred by the Millions but they'll see also if you're going to be giving eternal life don't you think that'd make a good old Jew a 144 man to realize he's done missed it but he's our and he's got salvation and it's going to happen the seals are opening to him and he sees God like it is but then he also sees that God didn't leave Israel out of this right that's right he didn't annihilate Israel because of what they were doing because they were blinded and here's the part that a lot of people wouldn't agree with God blinded amen I don't covered it now so you'll take the point right right I'm not talking about Wall Street Jews I'm not talking about every Jew I'm not talking about the priest and those guys that were there hollering for his blood they blinded themselves right but when they blinded themselves just that it is in the Gentile dispensation those who heard the message those who didn't hear the message the prophet said foolish virgin he said and the ones who heard the message but were blinded by the false Shepherds they are foolish virgins to be given eternal life I'm not talking about all Israel I've laid it out in order of what I'm saying God blinded his own people the scripture said blindness in part why does it say in part because one day that part's going to be taken away the part that's blinding them is going to be taken away you say well I I can see how that that they were you know these people blind I'm not talking about the people who saw the truth and blinded their own eyes right now I've done been over that a dozen times I'm talking about the real true Israel as a nation of God that has been martyred down to the ages for their testimony and you better get it right now the word of God right and their testimony yeah but I just can't see how Israel's got a word of God the Bible says it the prophet said it what are you gonna do with it if you see the truth and turn it down you're lost if a Jew sees the truth and turns it down he's lost but what about those who've never heard nothing right come on those who've never heard anything about Jesus Christ no nothing but the law and they've lived it to the letter go to their home at a meeting at times and they got everything so laid out in perfect order even to a place left there for Elijah to come right that's right because they know that Elijah will proceed to coming beside amen absolutely at Reuben when we go down to Israel that thrilled me to hear what the man had to say and what George and them said he said he said I believe that this was Elijah talking about brother Brown because they know that Elijah is going to come we know that's going to be Elijah and Moses they think Elijah is going to come and the Messiah right right will be right there what I told Reuben I said Reuben you're looking for the Messiah to come we believe Jesus was a messiah and that Messiah told us if we laid hand over sick you remember he was bitching and off I said you mind if me and Brother Dean here pray for you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the one we believe he said no sir I want you to you know what God healed him but the next morning I said how you doing Reuben he said wonderful now he's going to have problems he's going to have trouble trying to qualify in this group of people he better hope that he lives it long enough to make 144th house because he might get a shake because as much truth as he knows a man could quote the Bible ten times better than I can tell you everything about where this was and where Jesus walked and everything he said Sam I'm not going to show you nothing that I don't know personally that this is where Jesus walked and what he done we did not go to the Via Dolorosa that everybody wants to walk on he said because he's about three places and they don't know where exactly what was the mouse Placentia or something he said they got so many places that we don't know he said I'm not going to take if I don't know I know you're a vulnerable man maybe God will help you one of these days but listen Church go ahead with go ahead with murder number nine we're still on there I'm like I'll have to make sure we try to keep up with paragraph 225. the last Gentile brought to be brought in is in for the bride the blind has come to Israel for that purpose see for us to be Romanian you realize that he hadn't blinded Israel you and I wouldn't be saved now I'm talking about blinded whether you believe he blinded them deliberately or what he done I believe he did you and I wouldn't have come in I ain't talking about all the Israel and all the junk and the people that hear the truth those that blind their own selves I'm talking about a group of people sealed Jew is blinded now listen for a minute those people that were crying out for his blood those Pharisees and all that was arguing with him all the time down through there even gamaya and Nicodemus was never in the bride brother Brown said they could be given eternal life one to one or the other some be given eternal life for their stand all right right but don't tell me I'm not talking about them people that was the Pharisees the the the religious leaders none of them ever come in to be the bride of Christ now I'm not saying nobody couldn't get the idea so you get women you're trying to try to trap by this word and then you turn off the tape and say well I don't believe what he said some of those people could have received eternal life they stay in my opinions I'm not talking turn down God and they're going to be doomed for that turning down I'm talking about a people that was blinded that God himself blinded he put his hand over their eyes that they couldn't see that you and I could be saved if he hadn't done it we wouldn't be saved whatever you want to argue about the blindness just remember if blindness had to come to Israel you wouldn't be saved that's right shall be saved as it is written yes that's a scripture well no no that says all at that they said all Israel all said is not all Israel is Israel right how do you say that but not all Jews are Jews right you know how our Israel all you want to that don't mean anything at all we are the Israel of God we're the bride of Christ all right so all Israel shall be saved as written now he's quoting Old Testament scripture he'll come out of time or deliver and shall turn away ungodliness for Jacob now there's two scriptures there you need to consider and ain't got time one of them says al-azine comes to deliver you know where Israel's deliverer comes from from you and I whether you like that or not it comes from you and I out of Zion we are Zion out of the Bride come to deliver the other one says two design or something like that come to deliver you better get in your scripture to write now they are Israel that's under the this altar watch Israel was blinded for the very purpose of us being saved you believe that now Who blinded them God God blinded his own children that you're not going to be saved for that no wonder Jesus without standing at the cross an infused howling for his blood that was his own kids and he was the scripture he was himself the word and he knowing that those people what would have gladly received him now you're going to read your prophet knowing that those people would have gladly received him now why did he say that he couldn't go to Israel with his doctor I mean with his gift Israel right but he couldn't go that's right my iniquity I mean that's not full yet you leave this message and go driver won't be running around standing over there knowing that those people would have gladly received him and that's the reason he blinded them it's originally blinded him so they wouldn't recognize him can you come and shut your humble way and blinded them to it that they wouldn't receive it see the scripture said they would do it and he grabbed it all right and he glided what's blind Jesus said Jesus pitted once them even so much as he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they were blind Paul said they were blind for a cause for us but just remember one time Jesus said lay this not to their charge now he wasn't talking about them guys that started the stories and got everything messed up right it was late to their charge I'm talking about the Pharisees and Sadducees that was trying to trap him he wasn't talking about them he was talking about his little chosen people his little bride you know as we'd call it we know they didn't turn out to be right it won't turn out to be right they rejected the bride we are the bride amen but they're his chosen people he said don't lay this child next to their charge what do you think he was praying that he wasn't saying don't lay this to the Pharisee high priest he said you are of your father the devil and he certainly wasn't talking about the religious leaders when he said don't lay this to their charge he was talking about his little bitty group that was going to receive eternal life one day notice now I want you to watch this real close they were given robes they didn't have them they were giving Rogues now that's what the scripture says right white robes each one of them now the Saints now already have one like you here see we get white roads here the baptism in the whole goat but they were given but dire they were given robes and the Saints already had theirs and gone on CC and they had at night they they see they had not changed because they were blinded by God their own father told that the grace of God could be fulfilled to the bride so the bride could be took from the Gentiles is that right blind you go to the next one number 10. you sit out of the fifth CEO paragraph 246. how are you going to ever blind out Israel now he's not meaning God blinding out he's asking us the question see we think this or don't have anything to do with anything remember what I was saying a while ago they are the roots the roots of this Gentile dispensation of the bride of Christ has Jewish roots we're building on them they're not building us come on how are you going to ever blind out of Israel hey you're going to say they can't be saved is what he's saying right well if they don't come in this Gentile dispensation and receive Jesus Christ they're not going to get eternal life now where's your scripture I just give you a whole message a whole bunch of quotes words your scripture where's your quotes that's what he's just saying you can't blind to Israel oh how could that Prophet stand out there that day and say you look like a unicorn Israel whenever was trying to show him the worst parts of it and he said well he said whosoever blesses you'll be blessed looks whoever curses you'll be cursed oh my how are you going to do it how are you going to blind out Israel remember what our trouble today in the United States is what we have turned against Israel oh yes we are over there with the weather but yeah will I make them give up land or without making them give up the promises that God sin would belong to them that's right so we can't fight the whole worldacle I thought David done a pretty good job tackling it one day right right you think he was ready to afraid David picked up valve Stones right you know what an old Goliath had four more Brothers that's the story go read David probably figured I can take out Goliath but I better have some more Stones left over because there's going to be four more and I ain't going to be worried about might do it kind of like way be a dog and brother Mike and they take them all they went to Israel years ago and came back and they brought some little Stones you know from places and they got a little bit small just small Stone you know and it was there where David had killed Goliath and uh wait said Daddy you know he was seven eight nine years old or something I don't know he said Daddy said regular this could have been the stone to kill Goliath yeah one of that I don't know so I I kind of figured it might that might not be the stone you know and it you know it's like way more like book come on he said if he hadn't got that other one he could have got this one I said I agree with you but you see I can worry I mean David didn't work but now listen we ain't got time to read all of the parts you talk about the measuring sticks he's a unicorns of Israel just keep running up he had to Blind his own children to give us a change and we turn it down and don't now don't that make you feel about so little that you could crawl under a concrete block with a 10 gallon hat on and never touch it that's pretty small right yes they held to the word of God now he's talking about the Israel not the Wall Street not all these others listen they held see they held for the word of God they were Jews they had their law they stayed with it you remember last night they stayed with them and they were Jews and had the law and the law was the word of God remember we'll get back to it where the word of God and the testimony they have the word of God in the testimony the hell all right come on they stayed right by it that's right for the testimony they held they were martyred and here was sold on the altar after the church had done been gone now watch they had in their blindness martyred their Messiah and now they were reaping for it they realized it they recognized after it was gone on they see then when they come before the altar of God and now the grace of God to them and watch one paragraph you better read it again they had in their blind they smarter their Messiah now they were reaping for him actually 144 000. read it that's not the Israel of the fifth sealed you come on vaccine then when they come before the altar of God but now the grace of God is to them now watch now they could not by no means be Saints because it'd already be robed but here they are now your sold them to Altar for the word of God and the testimony they held or be in God's people the Jews but now watch the grace of God comes to them and Jesus gives them each one a white robe watch come over after the church is gone because they were loyal to their cause and they were blind to you and they didn't know it they didn't know it they were playing exactly the part that God had ordained for them to play and here here John looks over and he sees Souls under the altar now watch he sees those Souls watch what he calls them they cry Lord how long watch just a little while longer let's get down right through the scripture they realize they've murdered their Masashi and they didn't know it they realized it they got murdered back to pay for it for doing the wrong and now look what a thing that they had to do see they was guilty of murder until they got murdered see they cried out hit bloody on us that's right and they were blinded now if they hadn't have been blinded God said let them alone they're not worthy don't worry but being that they were blinded by God his grace reached down to them amen talk about Amazing Grace and give gave each one of them a robe because all Israel will be saved every one of them that has its name written that's right all Israel will be saved yeah one not every Jew not ever Israelite oh who are the children of God the predestination of God we're blinded that you and I could come in and we pick up right there Sunday already think about it Israel was God's people chosen among all the nations the only people on the Earth that God chose various people he chose Israel above every nation in the world and he made him a nation and they ruled and reigned as long as they were in God's will but when they got out of the will of God then they began to lose out but then they'd come right back because he never did stop dealing with Israel even at Calvary you read you Daniel said me Wicks and look at your drawing brother Reynolds said he was still dealing with Israel up until Titus that's right in 80 70. I read you books said he's still dealing with Israel no when that when I went across show me where he said it I showed you where he said what I'm saying he was dealing with Israel for until Titus come in not dealing with salvation unto him no he was not dealing with Israel as salvation in the Old Testament of the Salvation we're talking about let's do the Gentiles which is the new birth to receive while we're here on Earth he was dealing with him as a nation and he run to the world and they've been blinded and they've run down in those countries you've been down there in the bed at the mercy of those people when Hitler and them took over Germany had the money that's why Israel never did like I mean Hitler never did like him he tried to destroy every one of them killing them all over the world and they came to one of our ambassadors and asked for help and that Ambassador laughed and made fun of them and that Israelis priest or whatever what he was looked back and said you and your people are cursed you know the family and how many of them has died the coastline Ambassador wouldn't help her you think we're helping them now we're over there making them give up land to try to keep from having a war we're playing right into the devil in his traps that's why it's going to come in there with that Covenant Covenant that will be made because he's going to guarantee him peace that Polk's going to stand in there and guarantee him peace and they'll sign a seven year agreement but that's not the hundred and forty four thousand that's not the chosen of Israel that's that natural Israeli guy over there I wanted to never will get nothing but what about white robes given you remember that I said it the other day I said the greatest revelation of Grace it could be thought of is that God would give Israel eternal life one day the chosen ones will receive eternal life when they don't even want it they don't know anything about it but I hope you caught up the connection to what I say when that 144 000 those two witnesses tell that 144 000. you're going to die for what you believe I said don't you worry about it it's your brethren have already died and we're just waiting on you to be sealed when we get you out of here there's going to be something take place amen Israel is going to get light ropes Brother Robinson under the salad seal I've got that in here but I didn't get to it did you say you mean he's gonna give them eternal life when they don't want it what good did you do that God saved you right well I was a good person so was the Pharisees and so was a rich young ruler that done everything in the world but yet if riches grow into hell you see Church one more time Israel as a nation is going to be given eternal life the given light Rose even though they never accepted Jesus Christ as their savior because God deliberately blinded him that you and I could come in I'm not talking about that religious leader that was standing there that argued with Jesus and spoke hard to him and called him everything and got those people gathered together I'm not talking about this money-hungry bunch of Jews today around the land what about an honest and sincere heart of a people a group of people who's going to give their life for their testimony for the word of God and God's going to give eternal life you just think about that 144 000. they're going to be happy about getting eternal life they're going to be happy about what's taking place even though they know they're going to be killed they're going to be happy about it you say well how do they know they're going to be here because they can read the Bible the Bible says they'll be killed but to think that they would stand there and say you mean you mean my people are going to give eternalize and they'll say yes Paul said Israel was blinded they said all Israel will be saved amen amen all of that real true Israel is going to be given eternal life don't you think that'll make them cry Shout it ought to make you cry and shots no no I believe now is you gotta be born again you ain't going to Heaven's ain't born again I'm not making no I'm I'm saying that because that's the way it used to be you know the old-timey preacher Union you don't get saved you ain't going to heaven come on great win but now what about the foolish virgin just going to be giving eternal life what about 144 000 I'm going to be given Eternal what about the Israel of God is going to be given eternal life what you see folks who are Gentiles so let's talk Peter pattern and say maybe we've got to Hope our only hope is in Jesus Christ right and he used to work understand thank you complete to be given eternal life because God sinned church if we can never get it down in our minds take What God Says and look right straight at him with the word and say bye and you're a strike I am healed thank you and not take well the doctor says and everything and I'm feeling so bad I'm hurting stand right there and saying I don't care what you say I am healed thank you we're glad to say we're saved we don't want to lose that confession we'll hold our confession the same with salvation as we do with the healing and remember it is the same atonement that it was made under purely if God can save us Soul why can't he heal the body yes but brother Dale I said it now confessed it and that will keep saying it right amen that's where the trouble is that you ain't said it enough come on you said the lifetime one day and you walk out of our heel that's right amen that's right but when you start doubting it and questioning it right that's right then how can God heal us come on Church how many years 224 each step I take anybody have a knee he stepped my tail My Savior goes before I have a date good morning foreign foreign I saw that today when I was studying this morning no wonder they cry no wonder that 144 pounds well they see not over their own they see their bleachers oh said he would be a Castaway is that what he said where's me please thank you a minute if he doesn't even louder he went every word of it he'd be a castle fight Maybe maybe that's what he was burdened about and God showed him all Israel he's saying already made a way it'll be contrary to every religious belief you understand why the prophet said there's going to be a lot of different agreement here you think you can appreciation the denominational atmosphere God is going to say this I don't see how that could be I don't care I'm tired keep ing but I know a lot of you even all names or something it's what I just got to be preaching about now that you left listen you hurt your feelings I don't give up give up I love you as a people and I'll give my life to one thing to try to preach this gospel to his purity you give a people a change to be able to receive instead of just pity pattern around well we're good people they're all going yeah yeah man years ago preached the message called as he said there's a place for everybody that even if you turn down this nasty day's a place for you well I agree with him there is one if we turn down this message it's called hell right right on Graves and then over all the way into the plane Lake of Fire no we can't climb blindness right that's right be real careful about saying I didn't understand I know I've done that but I didn't understand be real careful about it right because at the time he was doing it you might have been understanding there's no salvation outside of truth yeah sorry I wish I could give everybody and I can only give you one thing is to try to preach the gospel with me and where you can be set free because if you don't see that you need to be set free then you're lost but if you can see you need to set free then go do something about it right not a God to go to and cry out and he'll be there yeah but if you don't cry out for it it won't be there well I'll tell you what brother I've been in this message I don't care ever that ain't got nothing to do with it hell is going to be full of good people I think on these times Lord Jesus we're just trying to be as good as we could about expressing what we see and to realize that we're human beings and if you don't reveal it to us then we can't have it we can have a lot of quotes a lot of talks and ideas but we need you to reveal it to us Lord forgive our sins and guide us now take care of the people on the way home May our hearts turn with you Lord as the wheels turned upon the vehicle and may we see you living before us thank you Father for the truth you said you'd know the truth and they'd set you free we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you just need there's a blessed time that's that's awesome foreign
