«  254       †          And that's the way God does the Church. He beats every creed, every denomination, every man-made dogma, until He sees His Own Life reflecting in you. "If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not." See? If what is purposed to the Church, the Life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you, don't you stand still if you haven't got patience, virtue, all these things, and temperance, and--and things, and godliness, and brotherly kindness, and all these things that's required of you. No matter what you've done, no matter how much you've shouted, how many churches you've joined, how many feathers you've pinned into yourself, don't do it. Wait till genuinely, from your heart, you can forgive, till in your heart you have brotherly kindness. No matter if they pull a handful of beard from one side, you can turn the other cheek with sweetness, see, until those virtues, no matter what they say to you.

«  277       †          To my knowledge, I add temperance, self-control. I like that. "My country 'tis of thee, crown my soul with self-control, from sea to shining sea." See?
278    Patience. Oh, my! Tested. Don't you worry; Satan will count them for you. I'm climbing up the ladder now. See? I've added virtue, knowledge, temperance, now I've got to add patience. I still ain't got the Holy Ghost.
279    Then after I add patience, I add godliness. You know what that is? Like God. I add that. Don't misbehave myself. Go like a Christian gentleman ought to. Let that not be a put-on. Something in me, the love of God, just boiling. See? See? Not say, "Uh-uh-uh-uh, boy, I could do it, but maybe I better not." See? Huh-uh. Huh-uh. It's there, anyhow.
280    It's a Birth. I been birthed into this, into this, into this, into this, into this, into this, into this. And then the love of God, Christ, comes ...

if you think it's not true go call them right now and you'll see that they're booked up on a lot of things because that's doing it but we're going to try to do it about the second third week week in October every what that works out to be but we want to everybody to go and the church will be paying for all of that you know of your tickets there and things on the train but you need to let us know because we got to do that we can't wait till later and say well I decided to go or decided not to go or whatever uh you say yeah but that's a long ways off well I'm planning on going yeah I mean you know anything else comes up I'll say well I'm sorry that's secondary unless it's a death you know or I'm in the hospital or something I'm planning on going so I can go ahead and write my name down you'll find it on the list you know because you say we I don't know something important might come up well that means you don't want to go with us so just don't go with us okay no problem that's way to put it right okay sorry about that but it's true isn't it Revelations 3:14 and it's the angel of the Church of the the lady of sins right these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God all right that's to this age and time now this is to where the things that's required in this age because we're talking about a Rapture a change and things like that so you know these are the things required for us in this age to come to a change of the body and that's what we're supposed to be talking about in this age right a change of the body not that we're going to die and go by the grave that's all right but a change of the body to somebody to fulfill what Paul said you changed in a moment the twinkling of an eye all right Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue notice to through the knowledge Heavenly knowledge not just head knowledge right whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust who he writing to to Born Again Believers like precious Faith escape the world all right and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated in the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've we're trying to uh talk about this stature of a perfect man and uh you know I'm honest to say this and that's so Wade got a note there while ago about where he'd been preaching on the Daniel 7 or Sunday school on the Daniel 70 weeks and the brother said these big name or something big preachers said they don't uh They Don't Preach on these things well how many of you hear them preaching on the Statue of a perfect man we don't need that we're we're up here we're we're up way above we we're in The Headstone well how'd you get there that's the only question I say it without any Reserve or thought or whatsoever if you are at The Headstone or have the headstone then you had to come this way yeah no other way cuz there's not another way to get there well we're just born in this age oh that's Glory ain't it yeah we're just B well you know no listen the prophet said these things are required right now something's required means is it it's got to be done amen all right and see then that way we know for a certainty God has made a way for these things and for your Prophet to say that that for 30 something years he waited to bring this you know bring it on out into the open the way he would seeing things well that certainly must be something great and wonderful for doing those things all right but see we just think well oh we we're we're just born why brother Dale don't understand we're born again up here we we up here at this lady of see an age we don't have to worry about this well how'd you get up there we're just born up here well Glory Hallelujah you just born somewhere I guess you born kin folks to something you know I'm K folks to the prophet that's the reason I know I'm going well sorry to tell you you firstborn kin folks to the devil according to the Book of Ruth that's right now so we need to know how to get rid of that folks to the devil and then we could talk about kin folks to something else right lenes won't get us there right okay now but now see most people don't preach on things now I'm just honest I wrote this in my own notes no most preachers Don't Preach on these things why because they don't understand them amen that's right well I know all about this yeah it's like a brother one time he came by here and brother Mo was preaching on these things and like the statue of a perfect man all and he was talking about something in there and he said the brother said don't tell me about it let me let me let me study it out himself well he came back about 6 months later he had studied it out and he had to Rapture in Wesley's age the sixth age he had to Rapture in the sixth age you know why cuz brother randam said the brotherly kindness would be the time of the Rapture so brotherly kindness is Philadelphia boy that was great see he spent 6 months studying if he' just sat down and listened to a few tapes that's right but they're not going to do it cuz see that's not not made for that way and it's not meant to be that way so all right we're not no problems but the only thing I would say to you out there on the internet if my pastor wouldn't preach on telling me how to get get up to the Statue of a perfect man I'd find me another one amen that's right that's as honest as I can be with you I'm not pastoring no internet but I'm just telling you that's exactly the way I do all right cuz your Prophet said if your if your pastor don't believe in Hebrews 13:8 get away from him no that's that's all right but now what was we talking about we talking about this past Wednesday you know we've been talking about this stature of a perfect man we've come through faith as a new birth you know and personal experience of Faith all born again Believers come the same way through faith then these are the requirements that would come in this age for us to come because the word would be given all right we would come from Faith to Virtue right how do you get virtue well I just have to have it so I'll get it well how do you get it how do you get knowledge well I just study the word well like I said you you you got people that has memorized the entire Bible but know nothing about the truth of the god of the Bible right so that doesn't fit too good but we come up to Faith virtue knowledge all right Temperance was our last point and remember we were talking about what the prophet had to say about Temperance and he says on the uh statue of perfect man paragraph 228 and all through 29 uh no excuse me uh 219 he's talking about Temperance he said it doesn't mean to stop drinking alcohol not in this case stop drinking alcohol is a wonderful Temperance but that was known in the day you know probations and probations every you say those word and and you know alcohol and Temperance see see he says not in this case it's not Temperance there is not just a not not drink alcohol that's wonderful thing virtue is not to just be a virgin life that's a wonderful thing but when you turn it to Holy Ghost virtue see it comes down to strength and life and living and things and Holy Ghost knowledge is not just knowledge of the letter of the word but it's what's been revealed to you cuz you know how I state it I only have I I wish I had what's in my brain revealed to me that's right am but it's not so it's what he wants to reveal to us all right see then it's not in the brain to be revealed you know it has to come down into the soul of the individual all right but see what is then coming down to Temperance as a holy ghost Temperance not to just stop drinking alcohol but how to control your tongue but brother Dale uh I I I when I got born again I got rid of all these things you know I I I got everything I needed when I got born again well the baby's got everything it needs when it's born again lay it over to the side of the room put it in a bed until tell it you'll see it when it grows up to 20 years old you'll come back now that don't work too good does it that's a carnal illustration it don't work too good the baby's going to be dead right and that's what's wrong with the people reason they don't have these things things are not taught it they're required but see but brother Dale I Temperance how to control my temper I I never have had a temper well why you red face now why are you trying to prove to me you don't have one see just go ahead and let people around you find out what it is right and see then it's that ungodly uncontrollable temp emper of of blasphemian names paragraph 140 141 but I but when I got born again I I got rid of everything I you know I did I I I I I become so weak I was Meek and humble and just cross them with the words see what just cross them with the word and see what happens all right then you say but a Christian is not supposed to have a temper well why why would Peter say you need Temperance amen right amen why would God spend so much time and I talking about Wednesday in the Bible speaking about a Temperance and things and how that we needed to be you know somebody speaks to our to us we say Okay praise the Lord Road R you know bless God I'll run down you know you that's uh good Temperance in it all right but you see we have the prophet called it a man-made Saed up belief or Temperance I didn't say that he did like I said now why would Peter say we need temperance if we don't need it why would he say add Temperance if we don't need it see brother Bram even covered it he said Jesus got angry and drove him out of the temple but he's the god of temperance right right the Bible says be angry what and sin not other words something happens to you Road rage the first thing is sure anybody well you're not done that but didn't say well well thank you Lord I didn't get killed cuz the Bible says be angry sin not let not the sun go down on your wrath right you know my way of saying it somebody does something to you say for I forgive you I forgive you pra God get rid of that cuz if you don't you'll start saying something back the next day that's why it say let not the sun go down on your wrath cuz if you keep that that part of you the next day you're going to start justifying yourself right well I I really it really wasn't so bad anyway they don't understand me it really wasn't that bad see you'll wind up all right but what is it these things now let's go on into the thought now see you remember how I was trying to bring it out Wednesday night that these things must be the prophet said vocalized together all right now see if it's the right kind of Faith then if the right kind of virtue is brought in it will vulcanize to that Co why same material you don't vulcanize iron to rub same material so what is the new birth a born again experience a revelation of Jesus Christ what is virtue how do you get virtue by the revealing of God's word right right so that will type that type of virtue will add or vocalized together what about knowledge not head knowledge but holy ghost knowledge knowledge to know the word is right all right and and to see then that that'll vocalize together right all right Temperance then see the right kind of temperance will vulcanize together with all the other so it's all the same material now as we come to patience then think of it that way that this patience we're talking about is Holy Ghost patience not our patience we got a good many scriptures we're going to read a lot on this one you know in the scriptures because I want you to to do and this evening we'll try to uh we're going to have to do it two-part so we'll have to continue Wednesday night on this evening's message but what is now you add all of these together now remember how we were saying it you don't get virture knowledge Temperance patience then get the new birth right it won't work amen those are just man-made nature given cuz the prophet said you know Blasphemous n statute of perfect man that these virtues you know people have a portion of these and not even born again you've been around people you love to be around because of their nature their ways and their kindness and but you've been around people that claim to be Christians then I'm honest sometimes I want to get up and go where the sinner's at yeah right that's about as truthful as you can be all right but see what is each one of them is an extension of the other amen if it's added to it it has to be the same material all right so then being each one added see you can't have virtue before you have faith well I need knowledge that's what I need you can't have knowledge until you have virtue right now we're talking about Godly virtues we're not talking about head knowledge you can have all the head knowledge in the world and that's wonderful praise God but remember it's just laying in there waiting on you to where the Holy Ghost can Quicken it you see what I'm getting at you say well I just I don't need these other things I just need knowledge but it won't work you got to have faith first virtue which is a Christian Life lived in Christ to people to see the strength to pass you remember to let it go out to the people where they can see it and see then Holy Ghost knowledge that's Revelation that's not head knowledge amen oh we thought we had Holy Ghost knowledge didn't we you remember how we was when we argue with you the way to baptize with father son Holy Ghost cuz the Bible says it oh that was really Holy Ghost knowledge wouldn't it then Peter come on over 10 days later or something be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ well I just believe what Jesus said now that's wonderful knowledge isn't it but it's not Holy Ghost knowledge mainly that's stupidity but it sure ain't Holy Ghost those knowledge all right now so then is what I'm saying then you have to have this before you can have this you have to have this you got to have faith first then virtue then knowledge then Temperance before you can have patience well I just have patience I just got patience I I've got a lot of patience you know what yeah now what about it well no I I I I need Brother D for you to tell me how good I am and what I am as a Christian and what the end time is and what this is to be and where Russia is coming down in the White House the lady getting in there I need all of these things I need this this that and the other I don't need this simple stuff well you know what I've always found one thing in God the greatest revelation that he could ever give me is the most simple thoughts that could ever be amen because that's the only way I can understand it right all right but see then you get the point now you got to have faith you got to have virtue you got to have knowledge now you can say you got Temperance now we'll read one today sometime where brother BR said you come off all this way now come on I thought you were supposed to read the message did he not get over at the back of the message and did he not say fill me up Lord with this virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and love he said fill me up that I may teach others Apostles prophets pastors evangelist and teachers for the bringing of these things into the body of Christ you you didn't read that but it's just like I heard today where the brother had said that what we need to do is is we preachers and things we need to just kind of introduce brother brandham and then put on tapes well if that's the way you believe it go ahead how fun at it you no argument with you but you missed that quote he just said right that I may teach others the Bible does not say the prophet of Malachi 4 is for the perfecting of the Saints now I want a scripture on that it says the 5old ministry is for the perfect and now the 5-f ministry is only supposed to preach to you what the prophet preach that's righten I understand that this certain brother said that and all of the congregation was was any of you there when he said it was you shouting oh okay sorry to put you on the spot you the one that said it so it was said right maybe not the words that I said but the thought that to just play see years ago he sent me a note and telling me that I need to uh I still got it where that I needed to just preach on Wednesdays and play tapes on Sundays well see now he's moving it up until is we just introduce brother random and let him preach okay it's bringing a lot of patience to us right CU you know okay I no problems anybody whatever you believe is left up to you you on internet what you believe is your business you and Lula what you believe is yours but just remember I'm going to say what I believe the Lord giv is me I'm going to try to put it in prophet's message so I believe the Bible said five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the saint I believe the fivefold ministry is only to take what the prophet said and bring it to the congregation amen and that way it'll bring these virtues into being okay amen maybe it's oh we like that one what is patience oh yeah we like that one don't tribulation work as patience now if we get a little time to get over there in a few minutes I got a scripture that comes a little bit before then that I'd like for you to explain if tribulation worketh patience and I believe that right I believe tribulation worketh patience but not tribulation the way you're thinking it and we're not talking about the Great Tribulation no no no we're not talking about that it could only be if it works patience it can only be I'll put this in now and then we'll get back to it can only be tribulation could only work patience if it's tribulation over the word right not because you go out and do something wrong and they persecute oh people's against me and people against me they don't like me down at work I know I'm a little bit mean and arrogant and hateful but they just don't like me tribulation work as patience wait do we get on over a little bit more okay what is patience all right now according to your strongest concordant uh 20 5281 I think he's right yeah 5281 and what does it say patience is patience enduring patient continuance patient waiting means steadfastness consistency endurance in the New Testament the characteristics of a man who is not swerve from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety you know which is godliness by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently and steadfast patient steadfast waiting for patient enduring sustaining perseverance where do we get down in a minute where the Prophet said that God has patiently waited do you realize he has patiently waiting on you and I 50 years since the death of the Prophet right than be 51 now I guess wouldn't it because he died in 1965 God has patiently you know that God is patiently according to the Bible waiting on a Resurrection come on so let's get into it what is it it's enduring in other words it's it's putting up or keeping waiting you know not getting ahead and and doing but waiting and then we'll get down to some more where you know that that God gives us the patience but you know the patience is spoke of a lot in the Bible all right see I decided to use this way on this one because it kind of breaks up the other we just reading but all right go ahead now we've got a lot of scripture to read so I told him he could just put up a bunch of them and we just keep reading Luke 8 and5 Jesus talks about patience but that on the good ground you know what that is a parable of the Kingdom which in an honest and a great heart good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience you know bring forth fruit with patience right you go out there and and you look at an apple in a certain right at start of the year and you look and there a little old bitty ball of a thing sticking back there and a bloom and then you know boy I got some apples well I wouldn't want to take them off and try to eat them you patiently wait right look in Luke 21 and9 19 he says in your patience now I thought we talking about that in add to your faith virtue in your patience what possess ye your souls patience Paul gets into Romans 8:25 he said but if we hope for that we see not what do we do then do we with patience wait for it something we don't see something we've asked God for y right and we're going to get down at a while I hope we'll understand that we'll get down at a while to see we're the ones causing the problems right amen right so go ahead to the next one Romans 15 for whatsoever things were written a four time were written for our learning now watching that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope patience to wait we're supposed to learn that we're supposed to wait I remember it's kind of comical but I remember uh brother Brady and him telling about you know remember they had the the uh they took care of a place there that the queen came to and the only one that was allowed to speak back to the queen was this girl that was actually her slave and she chose her clothes she chose everything you know this girl had to do everything and when they she'd go into a certain thing she had to lay out everything and said that Queen said she'd holler at her and like Mary said she'd say wait she was the only one allowed to talk back to her and she chose her clothes and things well the queen had to wait patiently then all right but look we need to learn that we through patience if patience we possess our soul then we should learn that patience and the comfort of the scriptures would bring us to a hope and that's a hope that needed not to be ashamed not just I hope verse five now the god of patience well I didn't know God had I didn't know he well the Bible said he's the god of patience yeah but he don't have to wait he just he waits he waits and he waits God has patience right cuz he's the god of patience and consolation Grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus first Thessalonians remember without ceasing your work of Faith what and labor of love and patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ that's Paul writing to the Thessalonians right for them to have what ceasing without ceasing your work of faith is great your labor of love is great now your patience of Hope is supposed to be in the Lord Jesus Christ go ahead continue on this is second Thessalonians 1:4 so that we ourselves glory in you in the Churches of God what for your fa patience and faith patience and faith you're going to see and realize I hope today they go together right right because it's the same material you remember that right God of your patience and faith and all persecutions and tribulations that you endure so you're going to go through tribulations and problems which you're supposed to wait patiently well Lord I don't want down the tribulation well what did he say in 1 Timothy 6:11 but thou oh man of God God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness we'll get to that on later this evening Faith love patience meekness he puts them all together right second Timothy 3:10 but thou Hast fully known my Doctrine now watch him manner of life my purpose my faith my longsuffering my charity my patience right amen but he put it all on what thou has fully known my Doctrine that's right amen he had a doctrine of patience we'll get back to it on godliness and all Hebrews there where it's therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go into Perfection Paul had a doctrine of patience you think he didn't when he was looking at things and knowing what was going on and he was seeing the you remember when Paul comes along he's already seeing the church falling away he's seeing them getting away from the things Peter taught right and the apostles right Paul sees them as they start falling away and he screams out about them that you remember my Doctrine now established on the word you remember my man manner of Life surely he had a virtuous life didn't he my purpose my faith One Faith one Lord you see how you can take each scripture and just keep on and on and on on one scripture my long suffering sound like he had pretty good patience don't it my charity in my patience all go ahead Hebrews 10:36 for we have need of patience what that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise now how come we don't receive the promise come on you see what I'm talking about you can stop on each scripture preach a whole sermon how come we don't receive the promise because we don't have patience right y we don't have patience wouldn't it be something to Abraham 25 years waiting on a Child R said in year he had patience okay come on now Hebrews 12:1 therefore seeing we we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses now that's Heavenly Witnesses that's not Earthly thing what does he say let us lay aside ever weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us now that can't be done in the natural in the natural you don't run with patience now the only one that runs in patience if is your uh long Runners where you got number four it takes over he's standing there waiting they're running the race and he's standing there waiting but when they get to him he ain't waiting and he ain't patient no more he's the guy gear up to run it so you can't do that but in the Christian realm what are we to do he sin that which so easy and let us run with patience the race that set let us just live and have patience to wait patience with one another we'll get to it in a minute patience with God right what about it go ahead and watch this one we all know it it's on down below here but we all know it we like to quote it tribulation worketh patience that's the one we get tribulation work with patience now how do how's that done how does tribulation work with patience we certainly don't line each other up and take a belt just start whipping well bud you going to get patience you going to get patience his old brother Tom used to say Tom father voice he said you just pump that guy in the nose Bo and he lean about he said pump him again Bo he said you pump him a little harder the next time he said he ain't coming back for the fourth time said he'll learn patience right you can do anything you want to say anything you want to but already got blood run out of his nose he ain't going to move again right that's not the kind right look knowing this that the trying of your faith work of the patience not to just to have patience because if something that goes on and somebody you know the trying of your faith I thought Faith was the bottom part of the pyramid trying of your Revelation what about it workers patience it's good for somebody to cross you that's right back in about 19 6869 there was a Doctrine called two souls and that was going around pretty heavy getting started long in there early ' 70s and they were talking about two souls and God give you a soul the devil give you a soul you know well I I I didn't think the devil could give you one and I kept looking till I found where the Prophet said he can't so it was all right he he he can't create all right but still I got to thinking about that and you know what I began to study on was the soul of man boy I was Tried by a lot of patience about it too one brother he may listen to the tape he'll know that the truth of what it was I preached not that God had a soul but that God was a soul he said to this other brother he said brother they preaching God is a soul the brother said he's exactly right brother turned around and told me later himself he said I preach 30 or 40 sermons off of that 20 30 something like that sermons off of that when I seen it well see I to have a lot of patience trying to preach and talk about the soul and the things when everybody else was two Souls why because let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing James was pretty smart wasn't it knowing this that the trying of your faith work of patience you want patience let somebody try you Revelation right let them try you Revelation let them tell you you fac you're wrong let them life at you and make fun of you for believing the truth that makes you dig right am so it's not beating you up that brings patience but somebody's standing against you about what you believe right and when everybody would stand against you some of the things I preached I walked alone until some people begin to understand what I was trying to say okay going up James 5:1 behold we count them happy which endure watch you and we count them happy which have patience go to that the word enduring look you you heard of the patience of Job right you've heard how job in patience but if you watch the rest of watch it job had patience and have seen the end of the Lord now what's he saying you know that job lost his children and everything right but you know what happened in the end God gave him twofold of every animal he lost right every animal he lost because of his trying of his faith he brought patience to him in other words he set back and he said I believe God told me yeah but even his own wife said why don't you curse God and die but what was he doing you heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord in the end of job he had double ever animal and he gave him exactly the same amount of children that he previously had now here's the words of the prophet he gave him was it seven I believe it's right okay he said he gave him the first seven in glory what all because of his patience right because of his patience to believe God Amen he WS up with double everything amen and the same amount of children giv to him in glory and he gives him seven more here well you know what that means I don't think brother randar the Bible would be saying well job got his first seven but the last seven didn't make nothing no he could apply the same thing to the last seven as he did the first seven and they would come right come on but that way you got to be patient when you apply something to your family and you see them going the opposite way that's going to make a lot of patience in you one way or the other right go ahead what do we got 13 14 Revelation says now what I think this is the second Church age or somewhere right second or third whatever it is Revelation 2 2 and 3 he said I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience now they were being persecuted to death by this time sure but they were having patience God said he'd take care of them he did and how that th can not buar them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars so evidently uh the trying of their faith was working patience in them because they were staying with the apostles in the doctrine and calling the others Liars of course now we call them brothers right I mean nobody wants to call a preacher a liar anymore oh that's he he's got a right to believe what he want to believe yeah according to the Constitution look now what does he say and has born and has patience for what for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted even to them people there coming down Through the Ages they had patience how would you like to be in the label of the fox's book of Martyrs that's right when they were just killing them by 68 million of them killed by their own records of martyrology and you praying they take your baby out just kill it they take your wife out kill them and you praying we think about the taskmasters of Egypt and how God was trying to form patience in those people you know what they were proving their patience was right when you come down to the Dark Ages because they were giving their life for the gospel they were proven patience to be right amen the trying of their faith not just because they were being killed for what they believed no the trying of their faith you know I never have understood that I'm as honest as I can be here I am I'm telling you I believe in Jesus Christ and he died for my sins I'm trying to make a story out of it and here comes the priest down you know the Catholic priest you know and he says deny your faith that's what do you mean don't you believe Jesus Christ died for sin yes sir I believe it well what's the problem I believe it and you believe it yeah but you don't believe it the way I believe it that'd be what he'd say wouldn't it right I don't understand that folks how human beings could do that that's right but you know they came up when was a decree when the when the Holy Ghost tried to come on that uh Pope or whatever he was and he rejected it and he went and wrote the decree it was better to kill the people to make them serve God than it was to let them go on as they were we've had a lot of people run before us on a lot had we but just remember that and here's the scripture we like to wrote what we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation worketh patience now you got the answer up above in James right the trying of your faith worketh patience not because tribulation is brought on you with the trying of it watch in patience it brings experience and experience brings hope am what about it what about it does our patience match up to those in the Bible okay think about it go ahead to number 16 now let's read what brother Brandon said of the Statue of a perfect man then after that fourthly you want to add patience to your faith watch if you got faith it worketh patience that's James right if you got faith it worketh patience the Bible said so this this is patience now that's the next thing is going to build this stature you know God has got real material in his building amen so see see how short we are brothers and sisters see why where we're at you see where we are at now yes sir right you see where Lula is at now come on see why where we're at yes sir see we have Glory we have shouts and things because we got faith he ain't denying a new birth on anybody right but when you come down to these things here God can't build us into that stature see he can't he can't make us up to that kind of a place now that's kind of OD is it God can't build us into that stature why wh why can't he build us to it when he acclaims that to have we have faith we have shoutings we have glories we have great things well why can't he do it something's wrong with our knowledge right our knowledge is not right we got head knowledge yeah but if we got Holy Ghost knowledg amen come on he can't make us you know God can't make you do something that you don't want to do that's right get that in your mind he cannot override your free moral agency that's right he can make you wish you did right yeah that's right well we he can't make us do it why cuz he's overriding right see he can't make us up to that kind of a place why because we won't make ourselves available that's it amen what do you mean brother I go to church I do this I believe everything pra say Amen where's your patience amen maybe that's why God does certain things to hold people to a certain way I know I've said that a lot lately I'm going to say it one more time we just finished the series on Daniel 70 weeks some got a little bit flustrated when he began to talk about taking seven years off of 2026 and making it down to 2019 and we're only a couple of years from there they got scared excited you're scaring the children but what about 1974 when I preached that that we could go past that 2026 and see if we went one day past it the overlaps and the thing that's perfectly right but it's not scaring the people into coming to God it will not never will patience you say well and nobody wants to know how come I preached it that way no one has ever asked me to come to their church I've been to churches and preached but nobody has ever asked me to come to their Church and explain why don't you think it hadn't been put out the first service that I preached in in a fellowship meeting rank it was the second meeting that had had I preached the second one over brother Jimmy Gibson I preached on 1977 being the 70th jubilee don't tell me they ain't heard it no but they don't want to hear it now time's running out you think I haven't had patience but you know why I've had patience because he told me it could go that far one brother I asked him publicly what will you do in when the Rapture don't come by 77 he said I'll get out of the message then he stopped and he said no brother he said I say we misunderstood the prophet you see I didn't have no worri I don't care if it goes to the year 5000 I have no problem I ain't going to be alive but have problem I think I proved I had patience right am now watch he can't make us up to that kind of a place we got all these other things that watch him right once he man doing we got all these other things what's he saying Faith virtue knowledge we fall slide off with it why because you don't come to the temperance the patience right he can't build his church patience with what what kind of a patience first thing is have patience with God if you got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience When God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience maybe some of you never experienced when God would tell you something that the way it was going to be and then you just wait brother Dale did you want the Rapture to be this late no way I was looking for it the second day after I preached it in 1974 I preached it and was looking for it that day wanting it to come that day but I proved it by the message in the Bible where we could go well we're pretty close right amen we're pretty close now watch this thing when it gets around and we start it starts falling apart on us when it starts falling apart and brother R says I gave you the quotes keep your home home belong to the Catholic church I didn't say that your Prophet said that Bo it's going to go haywire when things starts falling apart but listen at least you ought to be scheduled enough to know and know these things are going to take place why because God said it would good right amen that's it right patience right when God says anything we believe it that's all we got patience yeah when he told me Wade was going to come back to the Lord many many years later I had to have patience but see he's always wonderful in what he does you just have patience with him and let it happen and see go right in the middle of that and he comes back to the Lord and you shouting Glory Hallelujah and God adds some more and he says he's going to stand in the pull pit with you and preach with you he always gives you extra if you just have patience okay I know your patience is weering out there what say I asked him last night to heal me now I listen to the prophet right and I'm just as sick this morning oh what patience right God told Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign he was still believing he was patient with God that's right but yet we're prayed for and don't immediately get it what about God trying our patience what about the Bible where he sends things among us and great signs and wonders happen he said but if they take you to another God don't believe it he's trying you to see the prophet said to see whether or not you'll stay with the word he said he's trying to prove I believe it's God of this evil age he said he would prove that this bride in the end time would not fall like Eve what about it what about it God tries your patience go down to 16 let's jump to that one okay Noah had patience we're coming down you know he said Noah had plenty of patience 120 years now you ever thought about he went 120 years saying it's going to rain now you you got something you better consider God told Noah to get in the ark it going to rain in seven days it did not rain in seven days check your Bible he told him it rain 7even days check your see if it rain the seventh day you remember the story Noah's family come up to him daddy he said God told me yeah but he told you to say seven days and it ain't come he said that don't change me right read your Bible right see God tries our patience you remember what he said about Moses one time I don't know where it's in this one not but he said God wanted to make sure he had the right man when he got down to the Red Sea he didn't want no problem he said so he put Moses through a lot of trouble you mean God wanted to make sure no God wasn't want to make sure God wanted Moses to come to the place that he got out of all of his stuff and had patience right listen see 120 years then God tries your patience God tries them after he told Noah I said Noah I want you to go ahead and get in the heart I'm going to rain I'm going to run you to go ahead go ahead and get I'm going to run you the animals and all in there and I want you to get in climb up upstairs now what's he doing I want you to get up in there I want you to tell them people tomorrow what I've been preaching for 120 years is going to take place all right you go down there and tell them it didn't rain read your Bible God knows how to try our patience well that makes God that don't make God a liar he just told him seven days the rest of it's eternity right don't worry about it what was the first sign know I got now roll it on up got plenty the next day I believe he might have told his family and all you know he could look out and they'd see it and all he said well one day next day he turned around it didn't happen next day keep on rolling it up some Highway Believers come around and on and KN one instead of the black cloud here come the Sun the next day hey there ain't no Cloud that guy come up ah I know you was one of them he but Noah he had patience said if it don't come today he'll be here tomorrow why God said so when did he tell you that Noah 120 years now listen I've got to explain something here so I have to run F so listen now brother around uses Noah he uses the Hebrew children he uses Moses he uses all of them and says they have patience and on the message he's preaching that we have to have patience with our new birth working so don't get all excited about it and say well boy he didn't get that right well you you tell us we got to get born again then have patience and said Noah had patience got the quote Moses had patience got the quote Hebrew children had qu they didn't have Holy Ghost Born Again experience of patience they had patience right more than just a human mortal of patience but not Holy Ghost Born Again experience patience is that enough well I still think he said Moses had it and Moses that I've got it okay let's see you have the patience of Moses well well let's see you have the patience of Abraham y you ain't got enough patience wait till the rest of the sermon done right now look watch this one we find God come this far waiting for the church y right as I said 50 years y right just come the time of the death of the Prophet to 950 51 years what's he waiting on waiting for the church amen you remember the quote now but one thing outside you know the the Readiness of the Bride is own thing is holding off the coming of the Lord the quote we find God come this far waiting for the church but it'll be there don't you worry he promised it that's right somebody's going to be there you know what's going to happen to the rest of us we're going by the grave 40 years ago I preached that that the biggest portion of the people of this message would go by the grave what did the Lord show you that look watch one thing that he's waited for waited all this time for a res Resurrection God has waited he's waiting on you and I can I quote him adoption time when he can pour in his fullness in his baptism and change these vile bodies and the resurrection will take place God's been waiting on you and I he wants somebody to stand up and say it amen amen listen church if we're going to be out of here 5 years 10 years from now we need to start preparation what else you think we're supposed to do I would to God that a Revival would strike in the hearts of the Believers of this man oh we don't they not going to be no more Revival you're a liar brother Brandon said the bride had not had her Revival yet it'll take them on on Thunders to wake her up and you turn around and tell everybody there ain't going to be no more Revival it's not of worldwide sweeping Revival but why can't you have a Revival in your heart am I've had a Revival 50 almost 50 years waiting on somebody to catch on to what I'm talking about come on I don't have to talk and brag it's Dar the truth you go back some of you that's listen to the T go back in 82 and listen to the seals and there's a sister back there I can tell you word for word and see if I wouldn't screaming back there about a Revival in the hearts of the Bride of Jesus Christ not a worldwide sweeping Revival no we're not promis that that's to the Jews under the two witness but the bride has not had a Revival yet the prophet said why can't you have a Revival in your heart yeah but I don't see nobody running the house I don't see any SC come on you got to get it in here when they went overseas and they saw that little cop whever what he was they asked him where the Revival was at he said I'm the Revival if you're in me you're looking at you're looking at it well he wasn't empty in hospitals and running all over the place he's having revivable can't you think of one thing that anytime God reveals something to you that is Revival in your heart God come up this way waiting for the church that's right what's he waiting for a resurrection waited on Moses he said he's still waiting job's been sleeping for 4,000 years no worry he'll wake up amen he's still waiting God promis he keep rolling CU it just the last one or two that we want Moses in the wilderness waited 40 years years patience that's all right and we should have patience with one another too we get we get so much impatient with one anothers go ahead keep rolling he said it's hard to do he said I've tried to have patience this 33 years cuz that's where he said it that's 33 years on this message he said have patience women still bobbing their hair still just the same sisters I can look at you and some of you still trimming and doing things off your hair right but just have patience see have patience wait have it if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here have patience you remember that's the only thing I've ever told you he told me I said Lord where am I at he said if you'll have patience with the people it'll prove you got patience so that's all I've ever said and that's all I ever care about he throw himself in the breach and said God don't do it patience with the people God was going to destroy him that's Moses right first we got to have to where that they baniz together if you don't come to that stature of the dwelling place of the Living God if you haven't got patience patience and one another all right Hebrew children had patience God had patience God had promised them don't you bow down to any image they had patience patience knowing this that God will raise him up in the last days what are we worrying about it Daniel had patience so got patience wait Paul had patience patience certainly look what Paul had to do talk about your patience how about your Pentecostal people as long long as they got the commission they talking about the day of Pentecost watch it wait until wait until you're endued with power how long they didn't have no question how long will it be they just got the answer wait right then he comes on down what promis they waited nine days then the 10th day we were there they had patience with God now if you got that kind of patience after God gives you a promise and you see it in the Bible it's mine then wait if then if you've got that kind of patience add it to your faith and see how far you're getting now you're getting way up here now all right clock hand doing it too what about having patience can you wait for your family can you claim them yes I don't mind saying it because he told me God told me years ago in the scripture he says you'll be there with your offspring the F of my kids grandkids great grandkids what get away from God the more I know the promise is true he's going to bring them but it's their choice they're going to make the choice because it's not automatic because Daddy's this he's going to bring it but he said you'll be there with your Offspring you said with every one of them well why would I not believe every one of them why would you not believe every one of them well I can believe the on living T not Oh Glory that's real good good all right it was God made a go promise and God will keep the prise have patience you've got patience if not you're crumbling now look you have patience if you got patient if not you're crumbling so you realize what he's saying okay Faith virtue knowledge Temperance now patience but if that patience is not correct what's going to crumble come on I didn't say it he said you're crumbling off of this building here and knock all the rest of it down right I thought I had all this I thought I I didn't need I didn't write the book folks I'm sorry and knock all the rest of it down that one thing got to have that don't add it because it'll wreck your building if you haven't got patience if you hadn't got virtue to add to your faith that you say you got and if you haven't got any faith and try to put virtue on it it'll break your faith down see you say well now wait a minute maybe this is all a mistake anyhow maybe God isn't going to there's no God it'll break it how far are we down watch what he says on why I'm against organized religion that's the way God does his church he beats every Creed every denomination every man Dogma until he sees his own life reflecting in you now right beats it out of us if I do not the works of my father believe me not if what is purpose to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things and Temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness and all of these things that's required of you no matter what you've done no matter how much you shouted how how many churches you join the feathers and all that don't worry about it is that the last one we got any more okay blasphemist names to my knowledge this is blasphemist names now watching to my knowledge I had Temperance self-control I like that my country T of thee Crown my soul with self-control from sea to shining sea patience oh my tested don't you worry Satan will count them for you he's going to try you right I'm climbing up the ladder now and I've added virtue knowledge temperance now and I've got to add patience what I still ain't got the Holy Ghost told you there'd be some statements in this message would stand out now what's he saying that's why you people don't believe that that they have the virtues and that they say you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet so look at that they to come up here to Pati and said you ain't got the Holy Ghost yet Le un told you you had the Holy Ghost down at to bottom of the pyramid as a birth right right you don't have see you're climbing up self-control patience and time now watch what I'm doing so listen patience you ain't got the Holy Spirit you don't have the Holy Spirit at patient no you had the Holy Spirit when you born again but you don't have the Holy Spirit the disciples had they had the Holy Spirit you don't have the faith of the father just because you got patience so you come all this way and ain't got the Holy Ghost yet what you ain't got what they had in the original you ain't got it the way they had it so you wait and I had patience had G in this right what about it Church because that's what he says he winds It Up by saying it's a birth I've been birthed into this and this and this and this and this there's not seven New Birth a birth means a coming forth in two a birth means a coming forth in two you had the new birth you don't have seven new births you have the new birth but you're birthed into these virtues right see don't worry about it Satan's going to try it for you into this into this and then the love of God Christ comes down and seals all that up in me for service I hope you're listening praying CU there's some things right around I told you there'd be some things said that would be stumbling cuz that right there has stumbled the biggest portion of people of the message the ones who do not believe that you have the new birth as the book as it did in the book of Acts that's their favorite quote see we come all this way they ain't got the Holy Ghost yet that's exactly right we come all the way from here we're born again by faith we come all the way up to here trying to get where Peter was at Peter was right here where it said holy spirit and see we come right here to patience we ain't got the holy spirit yet no we ain't got it the way Peter and him had it that's what he's trying to teach us how to get it where they had it come on is that right Peter's trying to tell us how to get where he was and in patience you're not where he was at godliness you're not where Peter was at brotherly kindness you're not where Peter was because he was at the faith of the fathers revelation of the fathers come on musician church do you understand this is not just talking about something that we need to do or a good story I don't mean this derogatory against anything but there's a certain Lodge that you enter these brothers has told me about it and in this Lodge they
