[10:06] he promised his word amen and we just
[10:10] love his word if nothing like its word
[10:14] amen and amen the Lord has chosen us for
[10:17] this purpose praise the Lord then we go
[10:21] straight to the Word of God if you have
[10:25] a battle let's turn to Galatians chapter
[10:27] 3 it's so much in there for us as the
[10:40] Bride of Christ as the Word of God has
[10:42] been made playing amen
[10:45] through the message of the hour amen now
[10:50] we can read with full understanding amen
[10:54] now we can see ourselves in the Word of
[10:57] God it's written there it's written
[11:00] there is fear your name is there hey
[11:04] Mara my name is dear
[11:05] but until you see for yourself they amen
[11:10] lovely some of us a preacher preached
[11:12] one time in Jamaica some up to wake up
[11:14] first amen and then kind of grudge the
[11:20] other and touching here to shooting
[11:21] hearing get them wake up also because
[11:25] the promise is true amen well I should
[11:30] read a little further down but I'll just
[11:32] go right from here from the sixteenth
[11:34] verse ten a man died just like sometimes
[11:38] to us regards word and school now to
[11:43] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[11:46] made he saith not and to seeds as of
[11:52] many but as one and to thy seed which is
[11:57] Christ and this I say that the Covenant
[12:02] that was confirmed before of
[12:06] God in Christ the Lord rich was 430
[12:12] years after cannot be Dishonored
[12:15] that it should make the promise none
[12:20] effect Amen tangled by gutters amen
[12:26] Israel got this for if the inheritance
[12:29] be of the law it is no more promise but
[12:35] God gave it to Abraham by promise
[12:40] wherefore then saith the law it was
[12:46] added because of transgressions till the
[12:49] seed should come whom the promise was
[12:53] made and it was ordained by an angel in
[12:59] the hand of the mediator now a mediator
[13:03] is not a mediator of one but God is one
[13:10] it's the law then against the promise of
[13:14] God god forbid for if there had been a
[13:17] law given which could have given life
[13:21] verily righteousness should have been by
[13:26] the law but the scripture have concluded
[13:31] all on the scene that the promise by
[13:36] faith of Jesus Christ might be given to
[13:40] them that believe no wonder we have this
[13:44] unholy but the poor faith came we were
[13:49] kept under the law shut up unto the
[13:54] faith which should afterwards be
[13:57] revealed
[13:59] Alleluia therefore the law was our
[14:02] schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ
[14:07] that we might be justified by faith I
[14:12] like that but after that fate is come we
[14:17] are no longer under schoolmaster
[14:20] for ye are all the children of God by
[14:26] faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you
[14:34] as have been baptized into Christ have
[14:38] put on the ring put on Christ hallelujah
[14:43] there is neither Jew nor Greek there is
[14:46] neither bond nor free there is neither
[14:50] male nor female for ye are all one in
[14:56] Christ and if ye be Christ's then ye are
[15:05] Abraham's seed and here according to the
[15:11] promise this is the word of the Lord
[15:14] you can be seated there is nothing like
[15:17] it Amen when it comes to the individual
[15:25] hallelujah I believe God send somebody
[15:28] to enlighten or understanding amen
[15:33] - thus saith God in Earth and to whom to
[15:41] ascend to to receive it
[15:43] Amen that's it that's it
[15:47] a man as I was saying this morning had
[15:51] little more to this and we go straight
[15:53] to it right so the emphasis differs from
[15:59] age to age depending on the anointing
[16:05] that the church is under in each age
[16:10] carries their own annoying sing
[16:15] hallelujah the emphasis changes for
[16:19] different kind of of anointing that of
[16:24] the lion amen
[16:27] the Branum voice well ago was just
[16:30] confirming this the ox
[16:34] the man and the eager each one a
[16:37] different power a different anointing
[16:44] different strength and now in this age
[16:50] I think the Gospels of Dicky gay men we
[16:55] have Oh a Jinnah this is it you all
[16:59] emphasis is rapture we got to get ready
[17:04] for it after the wedding
[17:08] thank God the marriage of the land the
[17:12] coming of the Lord the whole emphasis is
[17:19] the union of the bride and groom this is
[17:25] the age when everything circles around
[17:29] the coming of the Lord every scripture
[17:36] that has been given every sign for this
[17:41] age and I believe even we have a perfect
[17:44] sign that the Prophet awake us to as the
[17:50] bride of Jesus Christ never before even
[17:55] think that up I'm listening to hearing
[17:58] on the streets open wide Amen in schools
[18:03] of maybe six to eight ten to twelve Oh
[18:08] God
[18:10] Amen because is got to be fulfilled got
[18:18] to be fulfilled we have a different
[18:21] emphasis today and the Pentecostals
[18:24] Nazarene holiness will wonder why we
[18:29] emphasize certain things but it is
[18:33] because we are living under a certain
[18:38] anointing
[18:40] it's time to wake up time to wake up
[18:46] president even the new presidents and
[18:50] things like that email bomber came to
[18:54] Jamaica and he met said some things and
[18:59] trying to get all the Americans right
[19:03] though
[19:04] told me sexuals the main crops in this
[19:13] leutis day was to break the Roman
[19:16] hierarchy but that is not our main
[19:20] emphasis at all we are just as much
[19:23] against the Pentecostals of today as he
[19:27] was against Roman Catholic we have the
[19:34] same gospel same holy goals but a
[19:37] different emphasis we are not living on
[19:41] the manage and I believe that church and
[19:47] we have to come in line with our age we
[19:53] are too long in this message reforming
[19:57] people we can take a pig scrubbing up
[20:04] making look nice put on perfume but it's
[20:10] still going to be the same that's what
[20:14] we do when we just take people up it is
[20:20] not in America yet but it's in Jamaica
[20:22] and make them look right but inside they
[20:26] are still who they are
[20:29] you are not reformist you are gospel
[20:34] preachers we have to line up with a
[20:38] message of the ow
[20:40] you are going to preach perfect truth
[20:42] from the scripture and we found yet
[20:45] rabid random get mixed up in the state
[20:51] the Lord
[20:52] the main thrust the Wesleyan age as
[20:57] conscious he met seven churches was holy
[21:02] living center 5% their preaching just
[21:06] don't do this don't do that and still
[21:09] going on you means over in this age we
[21:12] believe in holiness just such John
[21:15] Wesley did we practice the same thing
[21:18] but that is not a man it for us as bride
[21:27] still right still we have to do that we
[21:31] don't walk around and just like the
[21:33] world amen we have to line up is that
[21:38] right
[21:39] what a day we are living in we need a
[21:43] translation not a reformation if we are
[21:46] ever going to be taught or caught up in
[21:51] the sky we had better get what in this
[21:58] revelation restoration amen but bandage
[22:05] back to Genesis back to the beginning
[22:09] you have to settle that with him what
[22:15] have you Pentecostal he said here the
[22:18] main trust was speaking in tongues gifts
[22:21] of the Spirit that was their main trust
[22:24] we believe what the true Pentecostal
[22:27] believed but the emphasis today has
[22:30] changed from that of Pentecostal
[22:34] denomination coming from Jamaica it's a
[22:37] little different King in at the right
[22:41] time
[22:42] amen they were just about to change
[22:48] those people that we met and had good
[22:51] fellowship with 50
[22:53] years ago it's so different still
[22:57] Pentecostals amen
[22:59] my day he meant when we find ourselves
[23:04] with them and things like that
[23:06] this should pass your home and see a
[23:09] beer bottle and you flow as garden as a
[23:12] deacon you're going to be called up for
[23:14] that maybe somebody drink and threw it
[23:16] over there did it knock heads in the bar
[23:23] today it is the same gospel the same
[23:30] Holy Spirit but another 90 we are under
[23:35] no longer on the message for the whole
[23:39] trust now is the coaming we got to get
[23:46] ready the rapture the rapture I remember
[23:52] driving one hurly morning coming some we
[23:55] are going somewhere brothers I know I
[23:57] stopped it's just still a Pentecostal
[23:59] and he said I don't feel good it's
[24:02] morning I didn't sleep good last night
[24:05] right and it's like the rapture is is
[24:10] gone and in the public market some of
[24:17] the Pentecostals from that church goes a
[24:19] lot of them and then he said better
[24:22] Brady I have to go down to the mark and
[24:25] look at sister so on so it's still there
[24:27] and look at what a song choice still
[24:30] there or if they are gone I said oh what
[24:35] a shame amen they would be gone and he
[24:41] would be left it's time for us expecting
[24:44] our self
[24:46] he had more confidence maybe certain
[24:51] certain sister certain certain brother
[24:53] more than himself what an hour church we
[24:57] are living in it's time to get in line
[25:00] individually with a Word of God
[25:07] Scripture the two shall be in the bed
[25:10] yes and one is going to be taken to
[25:12] serve in the field working and one
[25:14] disappeared I would like to be me
[25:19] when it come to the rapture Church I'm
[25:23] going to say Tom Brady amen
[25:27] first I want to make that rapture you
[25:31] can home after but I want to be sure
[25:33] that Tom Brady make dad rapture and I
[25:39] want to keep it that way
[25:40] is that right think about it the rapture
[25:47] on on time all the Scriptures pertaining
[25:52] to the rapture amen it's before us now
[25:59] hey maybe we don't have to get funny and
[26:01] things like that because this is your
[26:05] day and this is my day hallelujah
[26:10] is that right the rapture the rapture
[26:13] the rapture that is the anointing that's
[26:16] supposed to be on us over the radio in
[26:22] the gambling scheme I don't know if like
[26:24] that over here that would demand place
[26:28] number 16 you hear people calling
[26:31] friends and asking what did it Montreuil
[26:34] what did man play and not only that but
[26:38] in Jamaican way right they would say
[26:44] what is yonder yeah
[26:51] okay and you hear them what is he under
[26:55] they nerve they please sixteen and they
[26:57] know what supposed to follow sixteen so
[27:01] me harlot thirteen and they know what to
[27:05] buy you know what thirteen years and
[27:08] they know policeman number and then they
[27:11] try to go that way
[27:13] I like to say we are to know what
[27:16] anointing we are on is upon I as I said
[27:21] this morning but been imprinted anointed
[27:24] ones in the end time is that right and
[27:29] called some in here from the scripture
[27:32] that was under that kind of a nineteenth
[27:35] and your anointing got to lined up with
[27:40] the word of God your dream got to line
[27:43] up with a word of God your vision got to
[27:46] line up with the word of God
[27:51] sure Georgia was a dreamer came to his
[27:56] father and he said daddy I have a dream
[27:59] and he told it moon Sun Moon on star or
[28:04] he picked it up far do you mean me your
[28:08] daddy and your mother have to bail
[28:15] Georgia said I didn't make up a dream is
[28:19] that right do you know it happened huh
[28:25] just add he junkie he wasn't afraid to
[28:31] tell his father because he knew he was
[28:33] spiritual he in you that is going to
[28:36] happen right when a few times is what
[28:39] his brothers but now his father and his
[28:44] mother God is no respecter of persons
[28:52] is that right someday it's coming back
[28:58] search brother branham book you see the
[29:03] hour that we are no living is that true
[29:08] reservation produces revelation that
[29:13] produces a translation it will be these
[29:18] divine revealed mysteries truth that
[29:23] will turn the hearts of the children
[29:28] back to the faith of their fathers
[29:35] sometimes you got to read better brenham
[29:38] message more than one time not just one
[29:43] time is that right
[29:46] but one said that Jesus does all three
[29:49] as he is descending so damn tough
[29:54] solonian 4:6 mm-hmm for therefore the
[29:59] coming of the Lord so we can say that we
[30:04] are now in the cycle of this coming
[30:12] already
[30:13] he has already descended from heaven
[30:18] him in his grave and brought it out with
[30:20] a shoat they missed it at the Pentecost
[30:24] where God says I am calm down it is not
[30:30] as much geography if you think now I can
[30:35] distance that's not what God is talking
[30:40] about God and morphe God came into a
[30:45] dimension where we could understand him
[30:50] fit us for the rapture hallelujah
[30:57] I believe it won't be too long church
[31:01] the fate of it needs is here when we
[31:07] read while ago for ye are all children
[31:13] of God by faith in Jesus Christ nothing
[31:18] else for as many of you individually as
[31:23] baptized into Christ have put on Christ
[31:30] hallelujah wasn't too bad when we said
[31:38] we have to fulfill this that gives him
[31:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:45] when we heard it it was very wide open
[31:49] for das set the law to put him on amen
[32:01] we are not going to emerge supper you
[32:03] know church that's it is off now looking
[32:09] forward okay there is neither Jew nor
[32:17] Greek there is neither bond nor free
[32:20] there is neither male nor female for ye
[32:23] are all one in Christ Jesus
[32:26] and if he be Christ's then are ye
[32:32] Abraham's seed are we think about it a
[32:41] little bit and if ye be Christ's then
