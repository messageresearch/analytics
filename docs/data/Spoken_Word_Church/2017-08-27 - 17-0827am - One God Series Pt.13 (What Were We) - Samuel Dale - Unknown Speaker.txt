«  52       †          Remember, there's only one form of Eternal Life, and our... even our names and our thoughts were with God before there was a foundation of the world. Because now we possess Eternal Life. And to be that, we have to be a part of God. So we'd have to be as much as in His thoughts, 'cause we have Eternal Life, and was predestined to this life. "And our names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world," according to Revelations. Now, that God had us in His thinking, then we have Eternal Life, 'cause then He spoke us, and we come into existence. And a word is just a thought manifested. God had us, in the beginning, in His thoughts.

«  45       †          I'm only saying this, not to mix up doctrine, but to straighten it out, that we might get away from this fear and scare. You don't know who you are. You are not going to be, but now you are the sons of God. See, you always were the sons of God. See?
46    For when God had you in His thinking at the beginning, you have to be, some part of you, your Life that's in you now, had to be with God before there. Well, when He, before He even become material here on earth, before there was anything, but God, you were one of His attributes. He knowed what your name would be. He knowed the color of hair you would have. He knowed all about you. The only thing happened is when you, being a sinner...

«  48       †          Notice. Those who have, tonight, Eternal Life, was with Him and in Him, in His thinking, before there ever was an Angel, star, Cherubim, or anything else. That's Eternal. And if you have Eternal Life, you always was. Not your being here, but the shape and form that the infinite God...
49    And if He isn't infinite, He isn't God. God has to be infinite. We are finite; He is infinite. And He...
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Oh [Music] shining in the light of your lorry or a few power and love but we say Amen holy your loving [Music] Oh and I want to see a man a man and a man and I want to see him don't you and good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures will go through John one where we've been reading you know bringing our thoughts in from ezekiel 18:4 so we'll go under those scriptures and everything just remember those that are away Terrence and Lisa and Zack them and I will be on their way back today from vacation and remember Wade and June is out in Oklahoma he's ministering today for brother Claude and just pray the Lord would bless them I think they're coming back in Tuesday night or Wednesday so remember to pray for that in each one all right sister Monica's Sunday school class to meet in the sanctuary at 12:40 to practice today then brother boy's class is to meet at 12:50 today to practice so we all have that good timing together they're all right just remember them sister Esther says please remember sister cleda she has a bad cold so remember that and sister Ruth says please pray for my great niece on her parents she's diagnosed this week with diabetes please pray for them as they learn to live with a that situation that the disease afraid the Lord would bless them all and now to remember the Lord willing this coming Wednesday brother Forney will be with us ministering Forrest this Wednesday and pray the Lord would bless him all right then the Bible study will be August a second six o'clock remember that fellowship meeting then will be the third Saturday that's on the 16th brother boy 11 will be ministering for us here so remember that all right if you look over you can see if they want to they closed the door but if you want to its dust okay they pull it back to ya okay the room in there we'll try to get it ironed out to we're working things but we the study's not complete yet we still like to carp it but we've got some rearrangements up here at the front now so don't worry about it and get all excited we'll just figure it all out and it'll work eventually you know one way or the other so do that and also we would ask you because my wife has been up here working I've been doing a lot of the work and doing things through the wiring and different thing and she's been doing a lot of picking up moving and changing things and if you would you know just asking you know I'm not throwing nobody I'm just saying it looks like it's um pues you've got four or five quilts you know well just narrow that down to one per person you know not have extra ones and all kind of books and everything else laying around and there's things under the seats into the seats we know where we don't have too good of a situation here but we still would like to keep it in a decent order to where it can be done and like the children you know and I'm making this statement to everybody basically while they're here I think a child somewhere in there say seven eight years old the children should be able to get to where that they're sitting down and listening instead of doing all of the draw in and the peddling and all like that now in little ones it'll hurt your feelings you know but that you should be listening to what the minister is saying to the congregation instead of doing all of the other things and if you do that it would take out a lot of the material that are in the seats okay because a lot of it dar is for children they're doing but now we try to be you know we don't try to be too hard on you we just try to do the best we can and all like that we don't have the best accommodations but they'll license till the Lord come so if you could take some of your stuff home in other words if a child is there it don't need 18 toys right well I want this and I want that one don't you worry about it if you draw everybody it brought everybody their kids you know they'd have a church full of toys we wouldn't have no place to sit so if you would help us to do that and pick up a lot of the stuff that's dire and things and you know and put it in order and put your seats in order and don't complain about the other ones just get yours in order you said well they're not doing it on the other seat that ain't got nothing to do with it it's get your seat in order get your place in order and that way you know it'll be a little bit better okay all right because that's what we try to do the best we can any other announcements just remember these things and pray the Lord would bless us all right father we thank you for this day and your grace and to us we thank you for all things we thank you for Calvary thank you for grace the Lord what kind of a day would it be without you that we thank you lord thank you for loving us Lord having your way with each and every one of us and father just guide us into your understanding that your light and they walk before us and then we can follow that light and it will lead us into greater days we love you and we thank you remember the sick ones there was just a cleaner that I were the old cold and things and just be with her and just take it that all that away and all the other sicknesses among us we believe you you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you now just make it manifest we love you and we thank you in jesus name john 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him now we won't get dire this morning we'll try to pick up the create or this afternoon if we can all right but it says all things were made by him and who is he the word who's the word God so you're still dealing on the one God and coming out to the understanding see all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not just the one verse from Ezekiel if we can get to that we wanted to Wednesday but we didn't get there but we'll try to do it to date all right ezekiel 18:4 says behold now this is God speaking back up read it the word of the Lord came unto me saying what means it's about the grapes and the things and and the Proverbs and all the nen he says behold all souls are mine so now don't even think about well the devil give me a soul and God just get all that garbage out the Bible plainly tells you all right all souls are mine so if they've sold any were it had its originality from God whether you're Christian or not the soul is the real you okay we'll get to those things behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father who also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die you may be seated well by the Lord that is blessing now to the reading of the word I know that I'm constantly repeating myself I know that and I know I do that purposely ah yes - who gets the notes Terrence is not here so he left it a little blank to put up your hand hold it up until you get you notes and make sure brother Larry they left one back there in his seat we want to make sure you get them at Terrence didn't Lelia so and we can do it this way who got in Joshua Pye somehow all right now we have spent a quite a time talking about in our are dealing has been before the foundation of the world we haven't got to time yet we haven't reached the situation of discussing time and physical creations we'll try to get dar this afternoon if we can all right but we're trying to deal with the situation and I notice I've got it in here we're bread around him he said I'm not trying to in other words preached the doctrine he said I'm trying to straighten out what man's ideas about a doctrines in science all right there's all kind of doctrines in the message I keep repeating that because it's true all kind of doctrines are the people of the message of this that or the other you know in this then they say I've got two quotes for it and and all like that and they can't read them to you that's that's fine you know and you say well if I read you what you probably said it must be right well we used to read acts 2:38 in Matthew 28:19 and we made it father son Holy Ghost right well we can do that with the message of the hour and the quotes and the things and just tie ourselves into knots but see what I'm trying to do is to get you to think sensibly and listen to quotes then sensibly alright the only way we can talk about of an existence of whatever before the foundation of the world it would have to be by way of the Prophet messenger or else it would be our own thoughts or concept right see then those thoughts and concepts are okay if they line up with the word the one thing I love to to when the Prophet made this statement one time he said ever prophet he told my prophets coming you know the Word of God coming through the prophets whatever prophet lines up his message that he's getting it must correspond with the prophets prior right so you can't have one prophet saying it's this way and one prophet saying this this away whatever is saying I don't care whether we understand it or not that's you know I do care but I'm just making that blunt to you that the fact is that if God says that he has to abide by it and he can't say something to one prophet and something other prophet he can't make one contrary to the other one so then ever wonder the prophets would have to check back prior to them you know and get there make sure they're lined up with all the way to Genesis what I didn't it amazing then that God would wait until the last days to bring us a prophet to where the entire Word of God could be brought to that prophet to be delivered to you now all right so it's lined up everywhere we don't have any trouble with it and what we have is we need a revelation you know we need for it to be revealed to us all right you forgive me for coughing and putting cough drops in but that a wolf sinus bug is doing and he's a give a ting me but that it's all right I have whispered before and don't worry about it but now listen trying to get the thought in order and that in the beginning we've read it over and over in the beginning was the word have we read that when we were in the bad news right I wouldn't change after would come into message it was us as opposed to change to fit the word but what did we read that is being in the beginning was the word the Word was with God see this to him let me talk coach said it was with him if it's with him it means he's with him you know but see then it goes on to say what and the word was god right now then it's self-explanatory but it's hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent because wise man cannot figure that out see they've done everything in the book to try to figure John one out all right and so you couldn't get it straight and in line well alright but then you come into the simplicity of the message and you realize that there's just one true and living God and if there's not many there's many manifestations of that God many ways he reveals himself but it's the same God so then we're not figure well the father's here and the sons here and the Holy Ghost and over here and you know we're trying to see that the same great eternal self existing Elohim just stepped over into another form bro and you know what it steps over in the foreign to me the son the logos the speech it's the same God all right then it's the Holy Spirit it's the same God it's not many gods it's the same God being revealed in a different way manner are a manifestation to her that we can look at it to see the truth all right now in doing that then we took the last two or three messages has been dealing especially on it we're in Ephesians says that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world all right then John says 15 16 since you have not chosen me but I've chosen you so now he was telling the disciples that they didn't choose him he chose them now if he chose them then Paul picked it up by saying we were chosen in him so you take what Jesus is saying and he said I chose you nor danger underwear got picked you out that's what it sounds like it's saying huh do you follow me I'm trying to illustrate the Godhead and talking of God for us to understand plain language of what we're saying here was the father it was not another person called a son and another person called the Holy Ghost right it's the same God in another form then take the truth of the Bible Jesus said you didn't choose me he said I chose you they'll be real careful of your thoughts go to remember Judas was chosen I leave that for you to think is it true Judas was chosen and ordained to be one of the apostles so now the Bible would say what make your calling he calls you to write along with the rest of them he chose the one do you remember the 70 that turned and walked away from him he called them but they never made their Judas never made his election sure he did because he went to his own wood he proved what he was so make your calling and election sure well you just make it to work I think I got it figured out until you freeze well that's good then that means you ain't got it figured out yeah it's all right I don't mean to hurt feelings I mean to be truthful but now remember Judas was chosen just as much as his rest of them he had part of the ministry he had gifts and signs and wonders did as well tried to make so much of a point about your choosing and and how it is and taking it back the end of not just a predestination alai deal or concept yeah well if I predestinate I'm predestinate you now hope you've caught on the one thing we've backed away up into God's mind from Derek back into the back part of God's mind to try to understand because now he says you didn't choose me I chose you well then he hand-picked people that's what it sounded like it's saying them go we know everybody he's not chosen right what did he he got pistol pick out down if he did why did he do it was it something you done or didn't do now we back up a little further right because you could do that with Jacob and Esau but your problem would be with Jacob and Esau is he saw would be the better guy than Jacob would be the troubled guy right because Esau was away on a better man then Jacob was Jacob wouldn't nothing but a shyster that's what he's really means that trip her up her he was a deceiver he saw wasn't that see we want to take he's on throw him totally away and all of these things oh he wasn't there he wasn't that remember when he's when Jacob was coming home he was sure he's always gonna kill him right he thought maybe I can appease him by giving him my families giving my ratios giving him maybe I can make up some touch him a little but before he got there Goddard already touch the heart of Esau and he saw goes out and said Jacob don't matter what you do I don't want none of your riches Jacob was a pretty good guy but he saw with a whole lot better so never make anything up on something you do or didn't do now we'll get to that to where you can see it once we come into the earth and the life situations like foolish virgins and things like that will be dealt with upon the basis or what they done or didn't do anything you feel filled you will be based on the basic code it it says they kept the word but they were not born again Christians it's the word of the hour for what they were all right trying to get you to look at something make your calling and election sure he said well Jesus that he chose me okay why did you see I'm just a simple question I try to to be able to talk about it and whatever but I have simple questions but see Paul look at the way Paul picked it up because even to take what Jesus would say in John it would look like he picked different ones for some reason right it's not that the way it looks but see watch a man that comes over and all it was was John riding what Jesus said jesus knew what he's talking about we when mankind read it what does it make it look like to you and I am I right mankind to read the Word of God doesn't look too good sometimes but remember it's got to say the same thing so when John says in his writings about what Jesus said he said you didn't choose me I chose you now Paul said me that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world I don't I know Church I'm sorry I'm a closest in my life to come into quitting preaching instead I am because I found it out but it stills thing don't seem to ring a bell were you you've got contradictions ever were but you're talking and you're doing and they're not in the Bible there's no contradiction in the Word of God Matthew 28:19 is not contoured acts 2:38 right they saying the same thing if you don't believe that I wish you'd get a little message we're brother Branham let's see what was the title they were listening just recently it's where all the ministers come together I'll remember the title the minute all the ministers remember come together and they were gonna challenge brother Branham on this this is the Godhead I believe the title Godhead explained and we should listen to that see we're still arguing what Matthew 28:19 comparison to acts 2:38 and we say well this one was writing this was wrong now they're both saying identically the same thing and that's why now we are two oh I'm glad her father yeah we've got a couple that wants to be baptized okay cuz a little wouldn't want to be baptized alright we can't be in it this coming weekend cuz it breaks a everybody be gone but it'll be the night I believe that's right tenth ever what the Sun default wrong it'll not be this coming Sunday but the next when the Lord willing we'll have a baptism or service so if he and the rest of you think about it want to be baptized we'll try to do that but I love it the way brother branham does a baptismal service and that's the reason I do it that way so he said this is a way to do it he said to fulfill Matthew 28:19 the baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost he said I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he says in that tape he said see you brothers I'm not against you on the basis that you baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost he said because the word says that but he says the truth of it is that's not saying what we read it it's saying Lord Jesus Christ and I said rejoicing in my heart to hear him I knew he did cuz that's the way I've always baptized you hear me when you get baptized to fulfill the Great Commission but the Lord Jesus said the baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and Holy Baptism I brother/sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now Satan can argue over nothing that shows that there's no contradiction in the Word of God all right Allah sees in John says Jesus in his writing says you didn't choose me I chose you now how did he choose Paul says we were chosen in him that's how he chose that's the same thing Jesus is saying Jesus has not said what we mentally read we mentally read and it looks like he's picking and choosing and remember the Prophet said he don't predestinate by his desires nor nothing he predestinated by desires he's picking and choosing that's your own predestination the pinnacle I mean the presbyterian the Baptist and things but when Peters when Paul said we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world and the Prophet says it what emphatically stating if we wasn't back there we never will be back there well yeah we want to figure out some ray of us getting something without going through the truth what does it mean when he said and I emphasize that over and over times 2 or 3 messages it doesn't say that we were chosen by him them come on I'm open I leave it you'll find brother Branham talking in his message in preaching said we were chosen by him but remember he can't be contrary to the scripture they said we were chosen in him what do you think is that a contradiction well what's your answer all right we were chosen in him that's why I've emphasized over and over it's not whether or not I chose him that's what we based it on brother Brennan said what he said it's not the fact of you accepting him we've got to do that you have to accept him he's not saying we don't accept him we accept him we said Lord I accept you as my savior but what if he don't accept us though then the Prophet says what he said it's not whether or not you accepted him he said it's whether or not he accepted you listen Church I'm trying to preach something that one of these days you'll back up and look at it and you'll say Lord God thank you I now can understand the Scriptures that were once so confusing in my mind don't tell me it's not confusing in your human mind to read one scripture as I said to read where Jesus said you didn't choose me I chose you and I ordained you he told Jeremiah wouldn't it he said I knew then ordained as a prophet before the foundation of the world listen church think about it he listened to your weight listening everybody listening real good he never chose you to be a part of himself oh we're getting down to something listen to what said he never chose you to be a part of himself if you have eternal life he never chose you to be a part of himself if you have eternal life you are a part of him you got it he never chose you to be a part of himself that's picking and choosing then don't matter where you want to put it when you get to the picking and choosing you'll start something you did or didn't do if you have eternal life that eternal life is the life of Almighty God is that right that's why your prophet will say if you have eternal life you always was eternal what always me I would always eternal I come here with eternal life in me that's what people are quotes you will have asked a simple question if that's true then what did Jesus died for remember the other day that I was trying to bring out Nicodemus and the thing why didn't Jesus they say Nicodemus you just need to realize you always was eternal because that's what the people of the message are making the new birth there's a knowledge of something instead of it being the person of Jesus Christ but listen he never chose you to be a part of himself if you have eternal life dad eternal out is a part of him and there's his children darzee's offspring he never chose children he had children they many of in here chose you children I mean basically I'm in here you know basic about all the grown-ups anyway you've got children right now did any of you choose them come on now it would be funny but we'll get it that's why I see people would say the man said I want a boy girl you know the wife she says I want a girl now you you're bound to get one of the two what did brother a did you choose your children now come on I'm gonna quote to message people there's people in this message that I heard years ago made a statement and said I'm not gonna have no more children cuz it might not be a true seed of God and said I'll only have a child if I know it's a true see well that's gonna be a good marital relationship man because he's on one side wanting a boy and he figures it Friday would be a good day now I'm not trying to be nice to him right and trying to say it right which he'd say no it's the girls what we got to do it on Wednesday now what do you got so you shouldn't bring up stuff like that that's plain language we're adults you never chose no child you didn't pre-plan your children ah you know what I'm talking about I'm not talking about the basis that's when you got together you said okay we're not gonna do anything we're gonna let everything run and God give us what you never chose your children right your children are a part of you we take the male with a DNA right we take him with the sperm and that's right but he never chose the DNA can be run right back to the woman it's the same thing as well as the man we just want to make it that the male is the sperm and come on the eggs just as important because your profits when it said it the egg is what produced your body your body comes from the egg that the woman produced but it had to be quicker than made alive by the germ from the male you didn't pick and choose your children they are a part of you you can't deny they can run a DNA on you prove who's who woman or man they can prove who the mama is they prove who the daddy is you didn't pick and choose they're a part of you right now don't mean for you to shake your head yes or no or whatever to do whatever you want to do you gently stay quite anyway now lock it down what a lot of people like forever bind the corrugation horrid scream Amy I really don't you know why cuz you holler and scream amen and miss what I'm saying cuz you're not listening I'd rather you just sit there and listen when it strikes you'll raise your voice and say Amen when you see what I'm talking about your holler Amen you didn't pick your children your children are a part of you god never told Rijn he didn't create children his offspring is a part of him the many quotes if I give it to you about it God had you to be a part of women yep you had to be a part of God in the beginning not when you just chose down here he chose you are you ready so we better find out whether we're a part of him how can we ever be a part of him if we wasn't a part of him back there will never be a part of him here but if you're a part of him here with eternal life adore so then you were a part of him back there we're gonna get into the little something in a second I hope you'll catch it but listen he said the next message that was in the future home part graph 129 paragraph 257 of the same message only the predestinated will ever be the one who does it only can be and you only can do it because look it proves predestination because if you got eternal life you had to be a part of God all times because he's the only one is eternal I'm going to identify the masterpiece remember there's only one form of eternal life and our even our names and their thoughts were with God before there was a foundation of the world because now we possess eternal life and to be that we have to be a part of God so you'd have to be as much as in his thoughts because our cause we have eternal life and was predestinated to this life and to be a part of him go now what are you saying I'm saying Paul puts it in perfect order to express what Jesus is saying jesus said you never chose me I chose you you need not to wait he got over here to do it but when Paul picks it up he says you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world Paul's not correct in Peter I mean John and his writings in the words of Jesus he's telling you what he's saying he didn't choose us that's what I'm trying to get you to say we never want anyone you really blow it all I've ever understood is it right he didn't use his children they're a part of him that's how we're chosen that's why I kept emphasizing is the fact that we're chosen in him when I chose him because of something we done or didn't do we are his children where is our springs are trying to bring out and all Springs are not chosen well I just can't understand it what is it you can't understand somebody get up and tell me what you can't understand if we are in him if we have eternal life that life is a part of God right you agree that is a part of God was he didn't he didn't choose you go they tell you area chose me he chose you in him when he was chosen you were chosen in what was he chosen may I illustrate what was chosen before the world the great self-existing L am we call him the father in him was attributes attributes are his children I told you the other day to make sure you held on to that and good he had attributes to be a god right we said we got it all figured out he he created angels right we're right when he had attribute to be a father you know attributes to be a son he had attributes we only deal with the healer isn't a different night yet attributes for that what is an attribute it's a part of God a part of Almighty God if you have eternal life surely you would realize that life is a life of God he doesn't have to eternal life brethren said it well I thought I had to figure out go with Jimmy no he doesn't choose his children but they are his children he said you said he didn't choose me you didn't have to choose you now I will say this card we're gonna come down to it later he did choose a vessel you live in now you're gonna run up and down the line on that one right but I'm gonna quote brother round him to you for we start he said you're a great great great grandmother was red-headed and he said then there's no redheaded children in that he said but then you come as a redheaded child he said that comes straight from great-great-great-great grandmother letter Brown said now quoting he knows the very color of our hire he knowed all of our makeup he knows everything he knew that before the world he knows the body you will inhabit am i quoting him the body that you would inhabit he knew that before the world well because you wouldn't back her in the body before the world you were part of God when father God whatever you want to call him he stepped over into another form call the word the son of God songs that beginning go if you're listening to what I'm saying that son don't have the beginning that son was this Almighty God standing in another phone come on I know the message he said well it says revelation 3:14 there's a greening of the grave that's the flesh of Jesus Christ the beginning of the creation of God was when Jesus Christ was created in flash that body had a beginning but that son of God never had a beginning he was God in another form the Holy Ghost is not another god it's God in another form don't you understand you see that way it's been you say yeah but look why was your prophet then you know what I'm fixing says true basically from 63 to 65 is your basics of the doctrines of predestination and you always was eternal and seeds dwelling in you because the opening of the seven seals right the opening of the seven seals brought the prophets message into view right because his message was not restorations in time it was not reforms it was the word of redemption nobody talked to redemption like this man that's why I love that scripture where they talking about Jesus and said no man's fight like you I'm saying about this prophet no man ever played like that yet are you gonna make him contrary one to the other are you gonna make all kind of now this you know yourself now get off of it and listen you know yourself what your mind is working on and you know yourself that you were thinking of picking and choosing but now you know it's open into another Avenue it's not picking and choosing we didn't choose him he chose us before the foundation of the world not chosen like trying to pick out a bunch of people it was back there he chose us and the fact that we were part of him the eternal life that we have not body spirit and soul of the human out there'll often they but by the new birth in our soul that eternal life is just as eternal is he he was cuz it is his life now are you sitting back before the world and letting God just look down then and can have him a wonderful time creating mankind and bringing into things that he could manifest his attributes and come over here at the end of it winding it up preaching to a group of people in the last days the great mysteries that the denominations never understood where is a one that would understand then he could say in one scripture that he chose us was saying another scripture then we were chosen in him and they come together that's for understanding see we say we say everybody that was ever say he was saved before the foundation of the world right is that true everybody had ever saved was saved before the foundation world when Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain in every name it ever be was written to him right but then we try to make it that there's something different about us what about the foolish virgin they don't have eternal life to that they don't get eternal life to the white throne judgment right which you believe they'll get eternal life into our throne judgment do you well then how come God don't count them as basis always were saved if you account yourself he's always saved why wasn't the foolish virgin always saved you want to talk about a fifth seal Jude that has to be given eternal life why are they not talk about his being always was eternal goes in God's mind he knew everybody would ever get eternal life he said I come here with eternal life did the foolish virgin come with eternal life no okay you just trapped your own self you didn't know it I'll see if the foolish virgin didn't come here with eternal life how did you come here with eternal life oh I'm different that's where we're all that if I were saved before the world meaning then everybody that will go through the white throne everything would be finished before the world and God would know it or I'll be that away why do you want to make yourself come in with eternal life and everybody else don't get it somewheres else what about it I said we want to lay onto all of the quote from brother Branham I can do fewer they might tear on that internet now they're sitting in their studies listening this thing goes around the world you know we've done proved that brothers y'all show it to you in a hurry out of a hundred and seventy something countries this message used to be in a hundred and sixty something level from this church now you see him setting that Turkey boy he's wrong cuz I got all these quotes where brother Brennan said I come with eternal life but then you don't need salvation oh let's go one step further what does the word regain mean what does the word regain mean it means go back where you come from well how can you say I'm redeemed to say you're got to be redeemed you got to admit you've lost now you've got a lost eternal person it's what I told it to so people years ago that's been 40 years ago did you say God give you a soul the devil give your soul just kill the soul of the devil and God soul didn't need nothing I said according to my Bible the scripture says God won't dwell in an unclean vessel so you got guarding the devil living in you the same time and that's according to the Bible that won't work you know that didn't mean a thing you don't mean a thing on what I'm saying today if you're not gonna listen and privately pray in your own soul Lord let me understand what this man is saying because he keeps saying it over and over he keeps illustrating it over and over Lord opened my understanding so if you come with eternal life as a possession within you why did he not give it to the foolish person why did he not give it to the field field you a simple question was it just a knowledge that we come to is that your new birth just a knowledge to you then ball says we can have all of that and still belongs where with Nicodemus be the prophet said we were a part of God he said that's the only way you can have eternal life was to be a part of God so I hope you understand what I'm getting in I'm trying not to show you something I tried three months or four months ago to talk about that we say god this dwelt alone he was just some kind of a spirit just floating around and they just wouldn't nothing give it all alone you got to admit that before he ever created anything he had all of his attributes you agree with that he had his attributes before he started this way because brother Branham says his attributes are eternal and part of him but I don't understand that how could be an eternal healer I did it he just never had nothing to make it manifest well what about eternal life that's well I'm trying my best to get you to see he turned a life as a person in God before the world never had little identities little things floating around in him but he had every one of his attributes he never gained one attribute coming this away show me one that he ever gain I'll show you they were manifested by coming this way but he never gained an attribute coming this way he never received a child to make it eternal coming this way you don't lost me then if you were a part of him before the world then the eternal life you have in you now was what was back there not you not identities not people and not playing not souls we're gonna get to that yes your prophet said we were souls before the world you only have time to get it this morning we'll get to see that's good about where I can just take it on over to evening service what about it Church are you a part of God we're not talking about none of this junk can you tell me and I'll tell you and if you want names we'll call names ever doctrine it ever started about the two souls and all kind of thing wound up in polygamy why because it's so close it's the planting of a seed and that's so close until it's taken in the people of this message into polygamy you see why I walk very very soft because I know it what it can do I know what the devil's trying to do to stop me from preaching I know that and I never will because I can eat code I didn't call me and I didn't start it when he gets ready for me to quit you can kick his old ticker and take me out of the way and that's fine with me cuz I've done and I can meet him saying god I tried to get them people to realize who they are you realize you said what we need to know about the new birth what does it need to know about the new birth more than the fact that you and your children you understanding could be that if you receive the life of Jesus Christ within you in your soul that makes your soul eternal and that's redemption and that eternal life that you receive always was eternal and made you a part of God before the world ever begun made you a child of God well you're trying to make something pre-existent they the only thing that's pre-existing to me is eternal life i firm belief in pre-existent of eternal life but I also believe that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world right well what if he hadn't died 2,000 years ago on the cross why didn't he come into the world and say well it's all the knowledge anyway all I got to do is he gets kids in sciples to understand so I don't have to die do you realize what you're doing you realize if you bypass Calvary you're saying Calvary was false come on get your tops nienna tops if you've got the type of something the anti-type has got to be an exact fulfillment of that top because if not then your top is false prophecy you say what's that got to do with it he's got to do with one time although God before the world ever begun so Jesus Christ down Calvary he had to come to earth and fulfill that to release the life that was within him even though he saw you shouting according to jaw around in heaven before the world ever begun when the plan of redemption was to come and interview you've still got to come to earth as being lost and you got accept Jesus Christ as your Savior to have eternal life because if not you made your type greater than your answer top I don't mean a thing to you I know because that's this human but if you just listen see why don't you believe that God just only was just stepped over in another form same God Holy Ghost he stepped over in another form same God all the ghosts living in use the same guard he created the world the same going to create the world is the goddess living in you see that's why it's always eat something eternal look oh it's a part of God now maybe you've said along enough to work and pull back to the thought jesus said you never chose me I chose you Paul said we never chose him God chose us before the world because we were chosen in him you didn't do something good or bad to get salvation now how many of you children done something good to get to be have your parents as your mom and daddy well you sure are Carla now well is that sensible I mean brother Larry was this something you've done before he was ever born it made your mama have you you know none do it one of these days you'll understand while I profit will tell you and lay it down and show you that if you don't follow the Word of God your do's and don'ts will face you one day but then he'll turn right back around and preach you the gospel it says an unconditional covenant who would they don't matter what I do then you prove you're not a seed of God may I quote brother Branham for a second what about the African native that was on the farm in the olden days they had a whole bunch of slaves you know they'd beat them and everything else but had one slave he was always up doing you remember that story God said I want to buy him he said he's not for sale he said watch the difference you feed him differ don't you no no no don't do nothing said what is it said I used to wonder myself he said until I found out one day then over in his tribe in Africa his father was the king of the tribe and said he's the son of a king and no matter where he's at he's gonna act like the way we prove eternal life the way we prove whether we're saved or not is the life that we live and come on we're human enough and have a lot of failures love that scripture where Jesus had told that he said he signed you in you and me right you remember that Bible where Jesus said is I and you and you and me now when he said this I knew that's easier to understand because he can come live in us right but what about in you and me same God said I knew and you and me we talked about receiving eternal life could be enough but how was we in him we was part of the eternal life now are you back with me or how many times have I made this statement I don't want to be what God thought of coz he thought of Judas in the world and everything I want to be a part of the thinker himself the only way I could be a part of that is Paul said if the mind that was in Christ being you what he said do he said it make you a new creature it'll bring eternal life right into these vessels right here now you'll understand why brother Branham would say in the Bible would say we're not gonna become sons of God we are the sons of God you always was the son of God if you ever get eternal life as a new birth now I'm dividing it so you're not to hold me that's why your foolish virgin don't get a new birth she is an impartation of eternal life you feel sealed you does not get a new birth she's an impartation of eternal life even the 144,000 that receive eternal life here will not never be a part of the Bride of Christ they'll be servants to the bride is it odd then he would talk about Abraham and he said Abraham is my servant Abraham's his servant that you will never be nothing at that Old Testament you will never be nothing but servants even though they will be given eternal life there'll be servants you realize what it means to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ now I hope you'll follow me for a second see then we didn't choose him come on unless I need to quote from the Prophet did you say you saw God you saw God now run around him never said that you didn't cry and pray he said himself that he cried out and prayed to God know when he says you never saw God well I saw God you're not listening to the thought the only way you can seek God listen it's for God to be in you you don't know what you're seeking he's got to be in you who you don't know where the seeking parts that let's see what I'm blowing bubbles right because you're thinking in your mind little brother Brown I'm not yes what's he think let's see if I can quote how close I can get to I mean now brother Branham said dad brother Brennan said we never saw God but said I did no I did I cried and I prayed I fasted I've done everything seeking God and brother brother says I'd wasn't sinking him don't you understand he's telling you you not that you didn't crying for it he's telling you you didn't know how to seek God he knew you you saw him by your works you shouting by your prayers you sodium by you're not doing her doings you never saw him by where he says take my word and say from them what is down in the heart and I'll save you you see we say well I just don't believe rather random you understood he didn't understand me code ah I saw garden I remember when I cried I prayed and well there we I like to starve to death when I came in this message could I realized I didn't have God I realized I wouldn't born again the way he's talking about it but I had God in my heart not same time not same God I'd say angel time you know kind of things when he talked about the new birth I realized I didn't have what are you talking about I know what it means to seek God and cry out before him but I know a lot of times I'm honest and you listen to me a lot of that gets in your way because you think well what else can I do God and we have prayed that prayer sister Anne are you looking at me you prayed it a dozen times yesterday can I hit it mm-hmm we think we saw God but it was really God seeking us see we don't know the Bible the Bible says the goodness of God leads us to repentance that's Bible what led you to seek after God His goodness to call you he was searching for you Adam in the garden or art thou now you won't brother branham that's where I love the message see that way Eunice yeah have you ever heard brother run say this Adam and Eve you've done the wrong right and they put on them fig leaves now can I quote brother on him he said they were back in the bushes heaven church do you need that quote who Adam and Eve was back in the bushes having Church now that's better Browns worse you look at what Adam and he was doing but then God come along as it had my heart now he was in church what were they doing when they were sitting back there don't you think he was feeling bad about what she had done I mean don't you think she just had a relationship with an animal and you think this that she wouldn't live back there with Adams then had him on sorry I I gotta call him she was crying he would she was praying she never charged but her church wouldn't take it or nowhere see our crying out didn't take us anywhere it's where God was seeking after us he's him seeking us when we thought we're seeking Him what caused you to cry and pray you thought is you wasn't who's God you understand God was causing us to cry out brother branham's not against you seeking God remember what he said he said now Lord I've heard people say you need to get down pray that's what you need you do this you need to do that after a while he finally stowed everything down and said Lord just save me something struck and he said goes running down a railroad track God found a man no God found a man God's been waiting on you God's been waiting on you and me - yeah but you seem like that you make salvation that's God giving to you eternal life into a human vessel then you tell me what it is if that ain't what it is who justifies you who sanctifies you yeah but I didn't know you had to do that well they don't wonder if you're saved and I just come into message I believe the messenger prays God but remember the devil does - I'm trying to make salvation not just a flimsy flimsy thing been making it a part that everything in the Bible will fit together you know listen for a second than that come on musician you know that brother branham talking to evidence of the Holy Ghost you realize he talked the evidence the Holy Ghost was love you realized you want these quote you realize he taught in the evidence the Holy Ghost was gifts and signs and wonders he never said there's anything wrong with you just believing he never done away with all of those things when he said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word now you've got ever evidence love is a part of the evidence of God gifts is a part of an evidence of God your believing is a part of the evidence of God but it's summed up by finality realizing who you are and that that went inside of you is the one who saves you he's the one that's guided you he's the one that takes care of you he's the one that leads you because you're his child then we want to make it on something that we can get a big thing or a feeling about instead of just believing instead of taking a simple parable and it says the parable of the sower of the seed number 1 he said the son of man was a so where the seeds right so that put it back our number 2 this good seed is the seed of the children of the kingdom what if he didn't outfielder in order to come from like I've tried to get you to see it I come with a seed in me when was it put time what do you mean I come into world with it when did the Prophet say it was put tire he said it was put in there before the foundation of the world now tell me it's something good you don't or didn't do or what you went through to get all of it and come up in the seed and everything yeah he said it was put in you before the foundation of the world that's what we're not really we're not thinking in the morning stars sang together in the sons of God shouted for joy those angels are the ministering spirits men brought in to minister to the heirs of salvation is that right that's a scripture that's why they were shouting in hollered but the sons and daughters of God saw the plan of redemption what they saw they were going to come to earth and wind up in a lost condition but they saw that God was gonna come to earth to and he is gonna redeem every child he had take you back where he come from and that's why I keep trying to say it to you if you'd listen just listen at all you said I'm a thought well what if there's something back further than a thought and you start with a thought of something well we got really listening we'll try to get into more this afternoon because I want you to see you talk about choosing you never ever knew you going at your choosing you've got this going God didn't choose you you are him are you never will be if you have eternal life that eternal life is God a part of Almighty God he never had to pick it out it's a part of him it's his children all he needed now listen and listen to careful all he needed was the other part of John 1 what does a father need to bring forth his children a wife is that what fathers need to bring forth children his wife and that sensible well now you tell me who was in wife you tell me who was my mother he was my father you quote with that but who's your mother my mother is the word one day it'll strike on you when you see that he's that word and that word is your mother and it took your father and your mother because here's the word without the father to quicken it it's worth nothing there's your mother and your father you never thought about you need a mother what do you think was happening in the garden how long was Adam and Eve in the garden waiting on Eve to be the right mother but she went wrong now quote vertebrae no when it says let us make man in our image he said that was father and son it's a father's word and the son is the word all we need to do is just let the Holy Ghost follow right there quicken that word to make you allow go ahead what we are you might have a need [Music] write down your question dine and we'll cover
