[5:28] Jesus name
[5:31] amen Hebrews 6 and Hebrews
[5:38] 9 verse one Hebrews 6 therefore leaving
[5:41] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[5:44] let us go on unto Perfection not laying
[5:47] again the foundation of repentance from
[5:50] dead works and of Faith toward god of
[5:53] the doctrine of baptisms and of laying
[5:55] on the hands and of resurrection of the
[5:58] dead and of Eternal
[6:01] judgment and let's go down to the next
[6:04] and verse three and this will we do if
[6:06] God permit now if he permits it we'll do
[6:08] it all right we'll get back to that in a
[6:11] little while now Hebrews
[6:14] 9:1 Christ being come and high priest of
[6:17] good things to come by a greater and
[6:19] more perfect Tabernacle not made with
[6:22] hands that is to say not of this
[6:24] building neither by the blood of goats
[6:27] and of calves but by his own blood he
[6:29] entered in once into the holy Place
[6:32] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[6:34] us for if the blood of bulls and of
[6:37] goats and the ashes of an hepher
[6:40] sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the
[6:43] purifying of the
[6:45] flesh cuz see that's all it could do
[6:47] that's right it couldn't I got a message
[6:50] on that sometime to get to it it
[6:52] couldn't get into the soul and and do so
[6:55] it could only do into the purifying of
[6:57] the Flesh and the covering of sin
[7:00] so he says verse 14 how much more shall
[7:03] the blood of Christ who through the
[7:05] eternal
[7:07] spirit offered himself without spot to
[7:10] God Purge your conscience from dead
[7:12] Works to serve the Living God you may be
[7:16] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[7:18] reading of the
[7:21] word
[7:24] now we've been taking some thoughts and
[7:29] you know know trying to cover it a
[7:32] little bit and help us to to see and had
[7:35] a chance this week to be able to go back
[7:38] cuz I really haven't viewed any of them
[7:40] of the the videos that's been made and
[7:43] so we got a chance to go in video a few
[7:46] of them and I tried to cover the last
[7:49] three
[7:50] messages and I saw in that that maybe I
[7:54] need to try to
[7:57] explain myself more of what I'm saying
[8:01] as to what I believe the word is saying
[8:03] uh to you so you know uh bear with me
[8:06] this will be this morning and this
[8:08] afternoon it'll be a couple of messages
[8:10] or more or less to to make sure you
[8:14] understand cuz I don't want you to
[8:15] misunderstand me and go off and and
[8:17] other people to hear me say something
[8:19] and and you know go off and say the
[8:21] wrong thing about it uh when that would
[8:24] not be what I'm talking about
[8:26] now we we I said we've tried to cover
[8:30] and Paul here in Hebrews 6 he says
[8:33] leaving the
[8:35] principles of the doctrine of Christ he
[8:38] said let us go on to
[8:40] Perfection
[8:43] now this is the only age that we could
[8:47] understand Hebrews
[8:50] 61 and Hebrews
[8:53] 9:14 to be able to understand it right
[8:57] all right so now by with us in a minute
[9:00] we'll get to what I'm talking
[9:03] about but Paul said the you know leaving
[9:06] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[9:08] now we covered you know we don't you
[9:10] don't leave the principles like destroy
[9:13] it doing whatever the principles are
[9:15] your beginnings and and Foundation all
[9:19] right so now there's nothing don't if
[9:21] you through out the message today if you
[9:23] think I'm trying to say this way just
[9:25] remember remember one
[9:27] thing you don't do a away with anything
[9:30] that God gives
[9:32] you all right and he gives it to us
[9:35] right and perfect for the
[9:38] time it may not be what we think or
[9:41] whatever but it's perfect and right for
[9:43] the time and that's what we're talking
[9:45] about the title is Faith for the time
[9:48] for that time you know that the prophet
[9:51] of God said the little woman there that
[9:53] touched the him of His Garment she had
[9:55] faith for that time that's right all
[9:57] right now I won't try to go back through
[9:58] all the other
[9:59] and I listen very carefully to what I
[10:02] was saying about Abraham and all of
[10:05] those people there and and I'm pretty
[10:07] satisfied with that to try to go on that
[10:11] the those people were not born again
[10:13] Believers right now because Jesus hadn't
[10:15] died right see if he hadn't died and you
[10:19] read there in Hebrews 9 especially that
[10:21] he is the uh mediator of the New
[10:24] Testament well it was necessary for the
[10:27] new before the New Testament could start
[10:29] you had to have the death of the
[10:31] testator right all right that's that's
[10:34] simple and and doing you know we should
[10:37] understand it but we'll get you know our
[10:40] point of what I'm trying to
[10:43] say you don't leave the the principles
[10:46] of the understanding of one
[10:48] God of the understanding of water
[10:51] baptism of the understanding of the
[10:53] resurrection of the Dead uh you know our
[10:56] Eternal judgments that's where a lot of
[10:58] people say well you know that's not
[10:59] necessary anymore we've got deaths you
[11:02] know well uh remember what I brought out
[11:05] the last service I was preaching that
[11:07] remember you try to do stuff like that
[11:09] you're hanging your soul on a sky hook
[11:12] right and there is no such thing as a
[11:14] sky hook cuz there's nowhere in the sky
[11:16] to hook it too all right so you know
[11:19] don't do that let's stay with the the
[11:21] word all right now two I want you to
[11:24] make sure and understand this point that
[11:27] when you're talking about one God water
[11:30] baptism resurrection of the Dead Eternal
[11:32] judgment remember the Apostle Paul was
[11:36] the one that was saying this that we
[11:39] then we must go into Perfection so
[11:41] you're looking at a man that had a true
[11:43] revelation of these things not maybe
[11:46] your idea my idea or concept about what
[11:49] would be one God water baptism
[11:51] Resurrection or Eternal judgment but it
[11:54] would be Paul which was preaching the
[11:55] faith of the fathers right all right so
[11:59] now now surely we're not going to try to
[12:01] leave the faith of the
[12:03] fathers that would not be what brother
[12:05] randam would be talking about nor would
[12:07] it be what the Apostle Paul was talking
[12:10] about he was trying to lay that
[12:13] Foundation into the church to where the
[12:16] church would have that foundation so
[12:19] don't try to leave it and go on like the
[12:21] people of the message today see and take
[12:24] like the the one God and they go into
[12:26] the two Lords and and you know Jesus
[12:29] wasn't god Till The River Jordan and all
[12:31] that I don't believe that's a true
[12:32] revelation of the principle right I
[12:34] don't believe that will tie together
[12:36] with the Bible you know I'm just honest
[12:38] I'm not against anybody that's their
[12:40] business what you believe is your
[12:42] business what I preach is mine I have to
[12:45] say what I believe and then try to
[12:47] believe for God to help us
[12:49] all so the true Revelation are the
[12:53] principles Paul is saying for us to
[12:56] leave is the true revelation that he was
[13:00] bringing right now what was he meaning
[13:05] see what was he trying to get us to see
[13:09] what is the point see see we've got to
[13:12] have the faith of the fathers before we
[13:15] can even talk about going on to
[13:18] Perfection right but when you have the
[13:21] new birth say it Faith you know at the
[13:23] faith at the bottom of the pyramid then
[13:25] we have a long ways to go to go on to
[13:27] Perfection to bring to the place that
[13:30] the disciples were right right all right
[13:33] see then the disciples brother random
[13:36] was covering see that what did they have
[13:38] the face of the father now he couldn't
[13:41] come and add something different right
[13:44] he couldn't come and and bring us a
[13:46] different message everything he brought
[13:48] was related right back to what those
[13:52] Apostles had already taught right so
[13:55] because if not he'd have been hanging it
[13:56] in a Skyhook right you know he'd have
[13:58] been putting it somewhere that it had no
[14:01] foundation and it would be like the uh
[14:04] the doctrines of man that's come out of
[14:06] teaching the one God and the the
[14:09] resurrections and things and they'
[14:11] turned it out to be uh damnable heresies
[14:14] as the Bible would call it and and being
[14:16] things that would would not be of any
[14:20] value but
[14:23] now I I tried to cover on that too and I
[14:26] wanted to make sure you got me right I
[14:28] saw it and you know these are like I
[14:30] said a few things I want to make sure
[14:32] you
[14:33] understand uh when we was talking about
[14:35] the
[14:36] principles I was talking about you know
[14:39] that uh people today basically a lot of
[14:42] preachers in this message and that's
[14:44] their business now we're not there we're
[14:47] here all but they preach hair and
[14:49] clothes and dress and stuff like that
[14:52] right all right I believe in
[14:54] that all right I believe that men order
[14:57] to dress like men order to dress dress
[14:59] in order to cut their hair like they're
[15:00] supposed to cut it and women order to
[15:02] wear the kind of clothes they're
[15:03] supposed to wear and and be dressed you
[15:06] know modest as the Bible says and and
[15:09] not modern modest and and all right then
[15:12] you know putting that then the men ought
[15:15] to you know cut their hair and be right
[15:18] because the scripture said it the women
[15:19] ought not cut their hair at all trimming
[15:21] it burning it whatever you do it
[15:23] wouldn't be correct to do any of it see
[15:26] you know in any form I believe in that
[15:29] right but I don't believe I believe you
[15:31] can do every bit of that and not be a
[15:33] Christian all right you could do
[15:36] everything and not be a Christian that's
[15:38] not a Christian because you do that that
[15:41] doesn't make you a Christian because
[15:43] that you you do it and even like you
[15:45] know I con a phrase many years ago that
[15:48] people want to preach and they preach
[15:50] really is your wife They Don't Preach is
[15:53] your life worthy of the Gospel they they
[15:55] preach as your wife worthy of the Gospel
[15:57] you know and if we can get our wives
[15:59] lined up we'd all be ready to go well I
[16:01] I don't I don't agree with that but cuz
[16:04] I think the men was one that messed it
[16:06] up but you know you say well the woman
[16:08] started it yeah but the men took it up
[16:10] all right but now listen I believe in
[16:13] all of
[16:15] that and I believe anyone that's not
[16:18] doing those
[16:19] things you know in the correct way the
[16:22] higher the close address the thing if
[16:24] you're not doing it in the correct way
[16:27] then I doubt the Christian experience
[16:30] now I'm you know I'm sorry you know
[16:34] brother de you're saying I'm not saved
[16:35] because of the clothes I wear well you
[16:39] tell me the clothes you were is is
[16:42] Godly right could you turn around and
[16:45] face Jesus
[16:47] Christ men women whatever you
[16:50] know all right so I I I I know I'm
[16:54] blunt but that's why I don't preach on
[16:56] clothes and hair and dresses because
[16:58] that's not even the principles right
[17:01] that's what I was trying to get out in
[17:02] that like in that message there see
[17:04] that's not the principles the principles
[17:07] is a doctrinal thing which is one God
[17:10] water baptisms a resurrection of the
[17:13] dead and eternal judgment see you
[17:16] shouldn't even it shouldn't even be
[17:17] considered whatsoever about dressing
[17:20] right you know that that shouldn't be
[17:22] considered you mean you you you've got
[17:25] to you know if you left this church
[17:27] today and went to one where they were
[17:28] any dresses you know women you say well
[17:30] I just work with them cuz we're in the
[17:32] crowd you know now there's something
[17:34] wrong with you I mean you know men women
[17:37] come on right right that's not the
[17:40] principles no that's
[17:43] right now but we we you know we I try to
[17:48] do the best I can to preach the way that
[17:49] I I do and and and everything I I try to
[17:53] get you born again if you get born again
[17:56] it'll take care of the high the dresses
[17:57] the clothes
[17:59] if not then you're not born again that's
[18:02] as honest as I can be right you know
[18:05] what else can I
[18:06] say well you don't understand my case
[18:09] get born again that's
[18:12] right I mean I I thought we believe the
[18:15] life that was in US was supposed to come
[18:18] out well if the life within me is a
[18:21] lired hippie and you know slued off days
[18:24] like we do and my wife got on to me the
[18:25] other day she said get your belt on
[18:28] because I didn't have a belt on and my
[18:29] pants was
[18:30] dragging get your belt on
[18:34] you I wouldn't out I was just a house
[18:37] okay but see those things are to be
[18:40] natural okay see there's no salvation in
[18:45] that you say well it's proof of
[18:47] Salvation it can be
[18:50] right it can be but you can do every B
[18:52] of that and still be lost right see
[18:56] there's some things you know that you
[18:57] you try to preach and and when you do
[18:59] you always leave people with a question
[19:02] you know what does brother Dale believe
[19:04] about this all
[19:07] right
[19:09] see here's what I wrote down see if
[19:11] that's all that we need to preach hire
[19:14] dress clothes and things and I said it
[19:16] now that needs to be preached to young
[19:18] people that are coming in right but like
[19:21] I said too you don't have to preach it a
[19:24] lot of time if you sisters live it you
[19:27] Brothers we live it you know they're
[19:29] going to see what it
[19:30] is and they're going to go that away if
[19:34] they don't then they don't have what you
[19:35] have that's just simple that's but see
[19:38] if that's all we need to do then why did
[19:41] Paul
[19:43] say now that's not principles right you
[19:46] understand me right that's not what Paul
[19:48] said Paul said the principles was one
[19:51] God water baptisms or because he said
[19:54] baptism is plural the water baptism Holy
[19:57] Ghost baptism right you know and
[19:59] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[20:01] judgment now Paul said that was
[20:03] principles okay so then these other
[20:06] things are not principles they should be
[20:08] a part of our Christian Life right okay
[20:12] now that should put it cuz like I wrote
[20:14] it this way see if that's all we need to
[20:17] preach then why did Paul say to leave
[20:20] the principles and go into Perfection
[20:23] right that's
[20:24] right yep yeah but I want to ask as us
[20:29] to to make sure that we understand why
[20:32] did Paul say leaving the
[20:38] principles now Paul what are you talking
[20:43] about you call the principles go back to
[20:46] to chapter 6
[20:48] now and let's look at what he
[20:51] said therefore leaving the
[20:55] principles now verse two
[20:59] is the principles right right the
[21:02] principles is what verse two doctrine of
[21:05] baptisms UNL on hands resurrection of
[21:08] the dead and Faith toward God and things
[21:12] all right what is it now therefore
[21:14] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[21:16] of Christ let us go on to
[21:18] Perfection now watching not laying again
[21:23] the
[21:24] foundation of
[21:26] repentance listen
[21:29] from dead
[21:33] works now what is your thought of dead
[21:37] works okay turn over to nth chapter
[21:40] while we at
[21:42] it and he's laying down the thought of
[21:45] what he's saying in verse 14 look what
[21:48] he says
[21:50] again how much more shall the blood of
[21:52] Christ who through the eternal spirit
[21:55] offered himself without spot to God
[21:58] Purge your conscience from dead works
[22:01] that's right to serve the Living God
[22:03] right now Paul says two
[22:06] times dead
[22:08] works now what is your thought of dead
[22:14] Works see we could bring up a
[22:18] definition we could sum up a uh point of
[22:22] what Paul is saying and we can make it
[22:26] fit whatever we want right
[22:30] right see we can make it fit as I said
[22:34] and try to say that the higher the dress
[22:36] the cloth Etc right that we need to go
[22:39] on in the word and we could make that
[22:43] dead
[22:44] works
[22:46] right we can make uh and we'll read some
[22:51] in a minute we can make dead works as
[22:54] being false
[22:57] Doctrine sure we need to know that we
[22:59] need to go on and and not have false
[23:02] Doctrine right and and some dead
[23:07] works now the best definition I could
[23:10] come out of what brother randam is
[23:11] saying in my own understanding and you
[23:14] know because I just try to preach what I
[23:16] see right we look at Dead works as being
[23:20] something that we can
[23:23] do in any way to try to make us better
[23:27] right you know something that's away and
[23:29] we try to do something different you
[23:32] understand yes it may have been said
[23:34] wrong you know for your understanding
[23:36] but it's what I'm talking about see we
[23:38] look at Dead works as as something that
[23:42] we say now okay now brother day we know
[23:45] that we don't we don't uh have to do
[23:48] these
[23:50] things because that would be dead
[23:54] works we can say clothes dress hire Etc
[23:57] oh that's just just dead
[24:00] works because works is something that
[24:03] you do to try to make yourself better
[24:06] amen right all right but see he says
[24:09] dead
[24:11] works now what are dead Works
[24:14] Paul brother brandom what is your
[24:18] definition of dead
[24:23] Works he said well I know what brother
[24:25] BR how he'd be dead works is is anything
[24:27] that you think think that would would
[24:29] save you we call that dead Works CU we
[24:32] know better than that that's right but
[24:35] is that his definition of dead works
[24:37] that's right what was his
[24:40] definition of dead
[24:43] works now remember Paul
[24:46] said two times
[24:52] now he
[24:54] says going on to
[24:56] Perfection and not laying again the
[24:59] foundation of repentance
[25:02] right from dead
[25:10] works and a faith toward
[25:13] God and he says over in Hebrews
[25:17] 9:14 he's talking about Christ and the
[25:20] the word of God and the things and he
[25:22] says leaving those dead
[25:26] works now you're going to have to to
[25:28] think with me because I saw that that
[25:30] didn't come across the way I wanted it
[25:33] to be
[25:34] brought and I really didn't cover a lot
[25:37] about it so I knew that I would be
[25:39] bringing a message brother brandom what
[25:42] is dead
[25:44] works okay let's see what he had to say
[25:47] about
[25:49] it
[25:56] okay paragraph 18 4 Hebrews Quest
[25:59] Hebrews chapters 5 and 6
[26:05] 57908 we would take it verse by verse
[26:07] each one of those
[26:09] things baptism we believe
[26:12] it there's one hope one Lord One Faith
[26:16] one
[26:18] baptism now that's not according to
[26:20] denominations right right that's not
[26:23] according to a lot of the people this
[26:25] message right
[26:27] right so that's a whole lot deeper than
[26:29] just talking
[26:31] about well we believe in one God the
[26:34] Baptist Doctrine is one
[26:37] God you talk to any Baptist and he'll
[26:39] tell you he believes in one God right
[26:43] that's right but when you narrow him
[26:45] down he'll say God in three persons
[26:47] bless his Trinity right because that's
[26:50] what I said right cuz that's the way I
[26:53] believed
[26:55] it see the basic doctrine of the bap his
[26:58] church is one God that's right go talk
[27:02] to one and find
[27:04] out but see the doctrine then is not
[27:07] true of their idea and we don't want to
[27:11] take that as a principle because it
[27:14] would not be correct see right to
[27:17] believe that he's God in three person
[27:19] Blessed Trinity right and get it
[27:24] right there's one hope one Lord One
[27:27] Faith one baptism
[27:29] we believe that there's a baptism we
[27:32] believe in the resurrection of the Dead
[27:34] absolutely we believe Jesus Christ Jesus
[27:37] died and rose
[27:39] again we believe that laying on the
[27:42] hands for the sick that's what it
[27:45] said these signs shall follow them that
[27:48] believe if they lay their hands on the
[27:51] sick they shall recover we believe
[27:55] that but what is that
[28:00] now are you
[28:01] reading but what is that Paul said it's
[28:05] all dead
[28:07] works it's something you
[28:11] do now let's look go on to
[28:16] Perfection now brother
[28:19] Randon are you and Paul in
[28:25] agreement Paul sums up his thoughts in
[28:29] Hebrews 6 and Hebrews
[28:31] 9 was saying
[28:34] that it looks like the understanding of
[28:37] one God the water baptism the no eternal
[28:39] hell the you know the things the
[28:43] judgments his dead
[28:49] works now what are you
[28:56] saying Paul what are you saying
[28:59] saying brother brandom what are you
[29:05] saying
[29:08] now to sum that up
[29:11] then let's make a statement and see if
[29:13] we can prove it going
[29:18] through if you take the message
[29:22] of Luther Wesley
[29:27] Pentecost
[29:29] just say the Pentecostal you
[29:33] know and you stay with
[29:36] that and refuse to move on now we're
[29:39] talking about the truth now we're not
[29:40] talking about Pentecostalism you know as
[29:42] a garbage kin right now I don't mean
[29:44] that wrong God knows it I'm just trying
[29:46] to make a blunt Point not talking about
[29:48] the the the the problems they've got I'm
[29:51] talking about there was a truth brought
[29:54] in the days of Martin Luther right of
[29:56] the J shall live by faith we must
[29:58] believe that there was a truth bought in
[30:00] the days of John Wesley of
[30:02] sanctification we must believe
[30:05] that all right there was the truth of
[30:07] the Pentecostals with the restoration of
[30:09] the gifts and the person of Jesus Christ
[30:11] coming back into
[30:13] church we must believe
[30:16] that but now if we we took that and we
[30:20] stay with it and do not go on with the
[30:23] message what does it
[30:26] become
[30:32] are you with
[30:34] me don't ask you to agree with me I'm
[30:36] just asking you are you
[30:41] listening see if we take anything why is
[30:44] it that we burn the bread after we take
[30:46] the
[30:47] communion you know we take the communion
[30:49] we burn the bad bread as quick as we can
[30:53] why because we believe that God gives a
[30:57] word for each day right and that we
[31:01] don't want to try to hold it over
[31:03] because the children of Israel that took
[31:06] the bread and tried to store up a little
[31:09] bit of it what did it do it rotten
[31:12] am real good one day right the next day
[31:16] it was rotten
[31:20] right now I believe Paul and brother
[31:23] brandom is explaining
[31:26] that and and I'm up for anybody that's
[31:29] got a different
[31:34] idea see if we don't go on with the
[31:38] message the message becomes and forgive
[31:41] me God and I'm just human I don't know
[31:43] how to talk it would become stale right
[31:46] right stagnated right
[31:49] right you're a
[31:54] Pentecostal and you won't go on with the
[31:56] message of the hour
[32:01] right what you have becomes dead works
[32:05] right is that Paul's definition is that
[32:08] brother brandom's
[32:11] definition but brother Dale you mean you
[32:13] can understand one God water baptism no
[32:15] eternal hell Resurrection all of
[32:18] that and it become dead Works brother
[32:21] brandom said that's what it is we
[32:23] believe that but what is that Paul said
[32:25] it's dead works is something you do y oh
[32:31] no no no no no he he he he meant to say
[32:34] well you meant all you want to
[32:38] right
[32:40] but I can that's the only way I can see
[32:43] it to be able to keep a line up of the
[32:48] message the way that it
[32:51] is now Martin Luther had the message
[32:54] with the just you live by faith you know
[32:56] what that gave him the new birth right
[32:59] you agree gave him a new birth but it
[33:02] won't give us the new birth today
[33:06] right what is justification today a work
[33:09] of the Holy Spirit
[33:11] yes but it is not the new
[33:16] birth you must go through justification
[33:18] signification the baptism and the Holy
[33:20] Ghost have the new
[33:22] birth see what we have will then become
[33:26] dead works amen if we don't go
[33:31] on
[33:33] right
[33:36] now remember my titles of the subtitle
[33:39] or the main title is Faith for that
[33:43] time and I tried to explain on there
[33:46] that all of those days were wonderful
[33:49] Luther Wesley Pentecost
[33:51] Etc but that was faith for that
[33:54] time that even the faith of the father
[33:58] to be restored to the Bride of Jesus
[34:01] Christ if we don't go on it is only
[34:05] faith for the time and will only reserve
[34:07] us a place you know in glory but we have
[34:11] to have a
[34:13] resurrection that's right now Paul said
[34:16] let us go on to Perfection he said we
[34:17] will if God permit it but you know what
[34:20] I'll get this this evening again you
[34:22] know what God didn't permit Paul and him
[34:25] to go on to Perfection that's right amen
[34:28] right mean is that true he didn't permit
[34:32] it right he withheld that until the end
[34:36] time am
[34:37] right Perfection there in the the
[34:40] scripture let us go on to Perfection is
[34:43] what a full age same as Matthew 5:48
[34:46] where Jesus said be therefore perfect
[34:47] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[34:50] right by the new birth you're
[34:52] perfect but the new birth doesn't
[34:54] automatically put you in the res in the
[34:56] rapture you know what I'm talking about
[34:58] the change the change the change I'm not
[35:00] talking about the New Birth will'll get
[35:02] to it this see and automatically puts
[35:03] you yes in the Rapture
[35:05] yes but not the ra you know you may have
[35:08] to die and go by the grave right all
[35:12] right I believe Paul is trying to
[35:15] explain to us that we need to go on and
[35:18] I was noticing brother randam used Paul
[35:20] a lot in statements like this he said
[35:24] Paul was one that did not want to stay
[35:26] in one place you remember that so he was
[35:28] constantly traveling and said doing that
[35:30] he was constantly wanting to travel in
[35:34] the
[35:35] word you know the depth of the word he
[35:39] didn't want to just
[35:41] quit even though it would be said about
[35:44] him about Peter that Paul says things
[35:47] hard to be understood see he wanted to
[35:50] go on now I I didn't bring them for you
[35:53] to read but
[35:56] uh I guess left it laying in the office
[35:59] but brother brandham says that Paul took
[36:03] five
[36:06] chapters to bring him together in the
[36:09] laying down of the deity of Jesus Christ
[36:11] and the things you know cuz I've made
[36:13] that statement that you come on over and
[36:15] Paul is saying you know the sum of this
[36:18] you know that he made all those chapters
[36:20] to bring it together H but you
[36:24] see if we don't go on in God's word
[36:29] that is what causes organizations to
[36:32] appear
[36:33] right that causes
[36:36] denominations to come on the scene why
[36:40] because the people didn't go on right
[36:44] you said no brother Dale are
[36:45] denominations when he got off well okay
[36:48] we we'll know what we're talking about
[36:49] but you'll know what I'm talking about
[36:51] too that they started out right right
[36:55] Luther started out right yeah true but
[37:00] he didn't continue on and it wasn't
[37:02] meant for to be continued on so
[37:06] thereby the people took his message and
[37:09] denominated it now Luther didn't
[37:11] denominate that's right wesle didn't
[37:14] denominate they denominate his message
[37:16] okay try to make those things
[37:20] plain dead works
[37:23] then as I was saying a moment ago works
[37:26] is something you think you do that's
[37:28] going to help you or make you better and
[37:31] dead work
[37:33] shows that there's nothing you can
[37:36] do there's not a thing we can do to make
[37:38] oursel better that's right quit this
[37:41] quit that that makes you a good person
[37:45] right come on it doesn't say you to quit
[37:47] this do that now it makes you a good
[37:49] person okay simple as can
[37:53] be now Paul in no way or neither was
[37:56] brother Brown and I got a big circle
[37:58] around this and got it highlighted
[38:00] heavily Paul was not calling the truth
[38:04] of one God water baptism right
[38:08] uh the resurrection Etc as to be a dead
[38:12] works that would be something wrong
[38:15] right right right
[38:19] no had he brought that he would be
[38:21] contrary to his own self
[38:26] right because he was the one saying this
[38:29] is where we're at and we will continue
[38:33] on if God
[38:35] permits now he's the one that said
[38:39] that so he knew that God was not going
[38:42] to permit it like I said the other day
[38:44] Paul was trying his best to get it out
[38:46] of the mind of the people that Jesus
[38:49] Christ was coming at that time
[38:52] right but see we think he was trying to
[38:55] get him to see what coming now he trying
[38:57] his best to get it out of their mind cuz
[38:58] he said there got to be a fallen away
[39:01] right
[39:03] amen now was he in any way calling the
[39:06] faith of the fathers would surely you
[39:08] think Paul was there would you right
[39:10] amen was he trying in any way
[39:15] to call that dead works as a false
[39:19] Doctrine now let's move away and you're
[39:21] going to read some things from Brother
[39:22] brandom that's going to sound like and
[39:25] it will be but when they took the
[39:27] doctrine of one God and twisted it into
[39:30] a trinity that truly became what de dead
[39:36] works right so as we're reading that
[39:39] think of
[39:41] that dead works is our carnal concept
[39:44] upon the word of God
[39:46] Amen our carnal
[39:51] revelation will be dead work
[39:55] yes but remember also
[39:58] that Paul and brother randam is
[39:59] explaining dead
[40:01] works as being that we don't continue on
[40:05] with
[40:08] God all right does everybody understand
[40:10] that
[40:12] now there are dead work when you twist
[40:15] the word of
[40:18] God and you make the go the word of God
[40:20] say
[40:21] anything
[40:23] contrary it automatically becomes a dead
[40:26] works right right cuz there's no
[40:28] salvation in it God is not obligated to
[40:32] that Twisted
[40:34] word now he did wink at
[40:37] ignorance because Martin Luther brought
[40:40] the message of the just shall live by
[40:41] faith but he said in a pub and drank
[40:43] beer and talked about the doctrines
[40:47] right
[40:49] right
[40:51] why because the message of
[40:53] sanctification has been lost in the Dark
[40:56] Ages
[41:01] so he didn't have the truth on that
[41:03] lineup there but he had the truth of the
[41:05] just your live of Faith
[41:07] amen all right now you understand do I
[41:09] need to repeat that again cuz I know
[41:11] that when I say things I look at you and
[41:14] some of you going that way that way some
[41:17] sleep some of them's playing with the
[41:19] kids and some of them's writing notes
[41:20] and some of them texting on your
[41:22] telephones and I've asked you to cut
[41:24] them off but you still sit in text with
[41:26] them that's right
[41:28] now you say well that's that's important
[41:29] to me
[41:31] well all you got to do is explain to
[41:38] anybody between this hour and that hour
[41:41] we're in church
[41:45] right don't call
[41:47] me during that
[41:50] time the only one that sort of call you
[41:53] or anybody that would call is a
[41:55] telemarketer do you want to talk to to
[41:58] them right you know what I'm saying cuz
[42:01] they don't have no hours anybody that
[42:03] knows you they know that you're in
[42:06] church at that
[42:08] time
[42:10] amen they don't nobody but a Jehovah
[42:13] Witness ever pull up in my yard after
[42:15] 8:00 on Sunday morning cuz I'm not
[42:19] there my family don't
[42:23] come they know where I'm at my sister
[42:26] one time something went wrong with it
[42:28] was a problem years ago and my sister
[42:30] come running up here to tell me about it
[42:33] you
[42:35] know you understand what I'm getting
[42:38] at that's
[42:40] right let's let's be Christians about
[42:43] everything all and don't get hurt when
[42:45] brother Dale brings out things to you if
[42:47] it's the truth just say thank you Lord
[42:50] you know and go on and forget it but now
[42:54] I'm going to State it one more time then
[42:56] Paul is not
[42:58] saying that the
[43:01] truth is a dead
[43:08] works now he's not saying that brother
[43:11] randam is not saying the truth is dead
[43:13] works that's right and he's not just
[43:15] saying that perverted truth is dead
[43:18] works
[43:21] right
[43:22] see he's saying that if we don't go on
[43:27] to
[43:28] Perfection what we have can become dead
[43:36] works I explained it that's what causes
[43:39] denominate organizations and then that
[43:41] goes on and causes
[43:44] denominations is people that won't go
[43:47] on all right does everybody understand
[43:50] that if you don't agree with me meet me
[43:53] after your service that's fine with me
[43:55] but I'm I want to hear your
[43:58] understanding about
[43:59] it but you see brother randam and Paul
[44:02] is
[44:03] saying we've got to go
[44:07] on if you to asked brother brandom in
[44:10] 1965 the last message he preached was
[44:13] what communion if you to asked him that
[44:15] day said brother Brandon what do we need
[44:17] to do you know what he said we need to
[44:19] go
[44:20] on right because we've not reached
[44:26] the completion right amen we've not
[44:29] reached the
[44:31] Perfection that we need to be because
[44:33] the completion and Perfection that we
[44:36] need to come to is the resurrection and
[44:39] the Rapture right
[44:42] right so now I hope you understand then
[44:44] and then we'll read what brother R said
[44:46] so just remember he's not making the
[44:49] faith of the fathers the truth of the
[44:51] Gospel any form of dead Works he's
[44:54] making it the fact that we stop
[44:57] and refuse to go
[45:01] on now you tell me now I'll make this
[45:05] statement and just leave it for
[45:09] whatever if brother Bram preached the
[45:13] seals why can't we understand
[45:16] him right if he preached Daniel 70 weeks
[45:19] why can't we understand it that's
[45:23] right
[45:25] see but we don't need to understand them
[45:28] things dead works that's what you just
[45:30] done you died when you say we don't need
[45:33] to understand the revealed word in its
[45:35] highest Apex of ever what could be
[45:38] brought to change this body you're
[45:40] making the message dead works right am
[45:43] that's
[45:46] right all right let's go
[45:50] on number two in your notes Hebrews
[45:55] paragraph 1 I was 84 and this is just
[45:56] the the next one right on
[46:00] that now First Corinthians let's read
[46:03] number one over again cuz some people
[46:04] forget what you read and then they got
[46:07] their computers cut off and they got to
[46:08] arguing about what you're saying and
[46:10] they running their quotes in their mind
[46:12] to where they thinking you don't write
[46:14] it down to where they can argue with you
[46:16] later about it so now let's go back cut
[46:17] the computers off start let's reread
[46:19] that first quote
[46:22] okay then we ought to take it verse by
[46:25] verse each one of those things baptisms
[46:27] we believe it there's one hope one Lord
[46:30] One Faith one
[46:33] baptism that's a faith of the father's
[46:36] statement right from a man that would
[46:39] understand we believe that
[46:41] there's a baptism we believe in the
[46:44] resurrection of the Dead
[46:46] absolutely we believe Jesus died and
[46:48] rose again we believe that laying on the
[46:51] hands for the sick that's what it said
[46:54] that's right these Sons shall follow
[46:56] them that believe if they lay their
[46:58] hands on the sick they shall recover we
[47:01] believe that but what is
[47:04] that Paul said it's all dead
[47:08] works it's something you
[47:10] do now let's go on to
[47:14] Perfection now what's he
[47:17] saying that's something you
[47:19] do cuz you see if you think that that
[47:22] makes you
[47:23] something you have made it dead works
[47:26] right
[47:27] if you think just believing the message
[47:30] makes you perfect you're making the
[47:31] message dead works okay he says let's go
[47:35] on laying on the hands them all as
[47:37] orders of the church but let's go on
[47:38] into Perfection there's only one that is
[47:40] perfected that's Jesus amen Now 1
[47:43] Corinthians 12 how do you get into that
[47:45] body by shaking hands no sir by joining
[47:48] the church no sir by being baptized
[47:50] backward forward in the name of Father
[47:52] Son and Holy Ghost the name of Jesus
[47:55] Christ am come
[47:59] on the name of Rose of Sharon the lily
[48:03] of the valley the Morning Star anything
[48:06] that you
[48:07] want that has nothing to do with
[48:12] it it's just an answer of a good
[48:15] conscience towards God and yet we fuss
[48:19] and stew and argue and split and make
[48:22] differences that's right but all those
[48:26] are it
[48:29] works we're going on to
[48:36] Perfection now those statements has been
[48:39] laying before me for a long
[48:41] time whether they lay before you or not
[48:44] that's all
[48:46] right when brother brandom is calling it
[48:49] and Paul is calling the
[48:52] word of the truth dead
[48:55] works
[48:57] you better perk your ears spiritually
[48:59] speaking up and start listening because
[49:01] I never had the answer if You' have
[49:03] asked me I could have read these
[49:07] quotes but I didn't have the
[49:09] answer as to saying that Paul is
[49:14] saying if we stay in one place right we
[49:18] will make what we've got dead
[49:21] works so we must be constantly moving
[49:25] and I thank God for that because that's
[49:27] my goal ever since I've been here that I
[49:30] constantly are trying to climb higher
[49:32] and higher well you just preach the same
[49:33] thing over again I would advise you to
[49:36] go listen again you might find out we
[49:39] move up just a little bit you know into
[49:42] a little higher
[49:44] realm of course if you get all tied up
[49:46] in it and fussing and stewing about
[49:48] it you ain't going to see the higher R
[49:51] Hebrews chap 5-6 1957 908 morning
[49:55] service paragraph 188
[49:58] he's bringing down about the religious
[50:00] man and the Bible and the schools and
[50:02] the things and moving mountains and
[50:07] everything well they say that's man's
[50:09] religion but he's nothing Paul
[50:12] said never become
[50:15] nothing for where there
[50:17] tongues they shall
[50:22] cease and where there's
[50:24] prophecies this shall fail
[50:27] right where there's all these other
[50:30] things will fail but when that it is
[50:33] perfect is come that which is in part
[50:36] will be done away see that's
[50:39] perfect what is perfect love what is
[50:42] love
[50:43] God let us lay aside all these little
[50:46] dead works and ordinances and ordinance
[50:50] and go on to
[50:54] Perfection you see it we're perfected
[50:57] through
[50:58] Christ how do you get into it by the
[51:01] Holy Ghost
[51:06] baptism I like to hear you preach about
[51:08] how perfect we
[51:09] are but just
[51:12] remember we can't be
[51:15] perfect if we don't walk in the light of
[51:18] the age right amen right right right and
[51:23] that in a daily walk not just in a
[51:28] 40-year period that we're in the message
[51:30] you
[51:31] know but continually going
[51:34] on same message paragraph
[51:38] 210 we'll read right on down through
[51:41] this because it's just a
[51:42] continuation I would advise you to read
[51:44] the Hebrew Book especially chapter 5 6
[51:49] 7 if you get that in your
[51:55] mind that he's speaking
[51:58] here that forms of
[52:01] reformation causes
[52:03] death now what's he talking
[52:08] about where's he
[52:11] at he still right in the book of
[52:13] Hebrews Paul said leaving the principles
[52:16] go on to Perfection not laying again the
[52:18] foundation of repentance from dead works
[52:21] and of Faith toward Faith towards God
[52:25] doctrines of B baptism laying on of
[52:27] hands resurrection of the Dead Eternal
[52:29] judgment Reformation forms causing death
[52:35] was the right words that's actually what
[52:38] Paul wrote see what he's trying to do
[52:40] now all these things like baptism one
[52:42] baptism backwards so you say oh now he's
[52:45] attacking all these bad doctrines okay
[52:48] they're dead
[52:49] works I spoke that they're dead works
[52:53] but just remember he's using the
[52:55] truth
[52:57] now all of these baptism one baptized
[53:00] backward one forward one in the name of
[53:03] the father Son and the Holy Ghost one
[53:06] Jesus's name one this way and that way
[53:11] and all these different little things of
[53:13] baptisms and of laying on our hands
[53:16] bless God I got the gift of laying on
[53:18] our hands
[53:19] Hallelujah you can get it this way and
[53:22] Hallelujah the people trying to explain
[53:24] how to get it laying all P that
[53:27] aside because that's dead
[53:31] works these
[53:34] reformations
[53:36] reforming see he's speaking of another
[53:43] class cuz this other classes don't want
[53:45] can go in Perfection okay he said let's
[53:48] get away from that and go on to
[53:51] Perfection the church is still lingering
[53:53] back in those things that's what they
[53:56] were trying to do the early Hebrew
[53:58] church was trying to say well I was
[54:00] baptized by our mercy and and I was got
[54:03] this and this and all these things he
[54:07] said lay all that aside leaving it
[54:10] behind but now did he say we shouldn't
[54:13] do
[54:16] it now listen to what he said about that
[54:19] and this will will this we will do God
[54:22] permits and the original said the same
[54:25] thing this we shall do do if God permits
[54:29] us see this we shall do if God permits
[54:32] us baptism lay on
[54:34] hands and
[54:37] things but that isn't
[54:40] perfect that's only the
[54:42] carnal reform
[54:45] right and that's where the churches
[54:47] leave off at today is on the carnal
[54:50] reform right one of them said well oh
[54:53] well the water the word baptized means
[54:57] it's this and it means
[55:01] that they set up organizations and one
[55:04] sprinkles the other one
[55:06] poures the other one baptizes his face
[55:08] forward the other one backward and all
[55:11] of those things some of them laying on
[55:12] the hands for the sick and some making
[55:14] Apostles and some making prophets and so
[55:17] forth by laying on the hands and
[55:19] preaching the resurrection from the dead
[55:21] and which is all right and the Supreme
[55:24] deity of Jesus Christ that's all right
[55:27] but he said all these are carnal
[55:30] reformations we've just been reforming
[55:34] now let us go into Perfection did you
[55:36] get the
[55:38] picture now let us go into
[55:42] Perfection dead
[55:47] works well not sure yeah we can see now
[55:50] brother Dale that all of it's about them
[55:52] denominations formed all these things
[55:54] where did the denominations come from
[55:57] that's
[55:58] right right every denomination there is
[56:01] came from the truth
[56:03] right misinterpreted of
[56:08] mankind they took the truth and made a
[56:13] denomination turning out to be carnal
[56:18] reform now did you get what he's talking
[56:22] about see that's why the AES went the
[56:24] way they did
[56:27] I thought we believe that Luther Wesley
[56:32] now listen and Pentecost I'm talking
[56:36] about zeusa street right you understand
[56:38] me do I need to bring these if you I'll
[56:40] be glad to he didn't just cover
[56:44] Reformation in Luther and Wesley he
[56:46] covered Reformation in Luther Wesley and
[56:51] Pentecost because they were carnal
[56:55] reform
[56:58] proved it because they denominated and
[57:01] died now the true Bride for that age was
[57:04] sealed Away by the revelation of that
[57:05] age in the time right
[57:08] sure but it took him to the
[57:15] Grave by reforming it took the people to
[57:19] the
[57:24] Grave John Wesley
[57:29] taught that sanctification was the
[57:31] baptism of the Holy
[57:33] Ghost he didn't treat this
[57:35] sanctification like everybody says about
[57:37] it they don't even
[57:40] read they don't read like read around
[57:42] talking about Martin Luther with all the
[57:49] gifts but John Wesley
[57:52] believed that he was Sanctified by the
[57:55] blood
[57:59] that's right that's
[58:03] Bible all right you took a truth made it
[58:05] a carnal
[58:07] reform you made it a dead
[58:10] Works cuz you're not saved you're not
[58:13] you're kept saved by the blood your
[58:14] Prophet said he said you're saved by
[58:16] grace through faith you're kept saved by
[58:18] the
[58:19] blood right but you understand what I'm
[58:21] saying and you'll see the point look at
[58:23] your song books and see if all of them
[58:25] about blood wasn't written in the age of
[58:27] of John Wesley right along in that
[58:29] period of time I know it was the blood I
[58:32] know it was the
[58:37] blood they didn't say about the
[58:43] life cuz you're saved by grace through
[58:47] faith the blood Keeps Us saved but it's
[58:50] not the chemistry of the blood that
[58:52] keeps you
[58:54] saved that was put on the
[58:57] ground and covered as
[59:02] a part to cover
[59:05] us to keep us from being killed with all
[59:09] the
[59:10] rest you know made a bu for blood but it
[59:13] wasn't the blood right but you see
[59:16] that's what they
[59:17] believed
[59:19] right and that made the word carnal
[59:25] reform
[59:27] I trying to think of the one that's
[59:30] listening brother brother said he said I
[59:33] used to believe
[59:34] that he said don't believe it no more
[59:36] though and it was from night to day of
[59:39] the truth I'll think of it
[59:41] minute but do you
[59:46] understand Hebrews chapter 6 paragraph
[59:51] 241 you read all of
[59:53] it though they be members of the church
[59:57] members of the Earthly body may they go
[1:00:00] on and lay aside those carnal dead works
[1:00:05] and press on to the
[1:00:09] Perfection you read all up and down
[1:00:12] Hebrews chapter 5 ver and six paragraph
[1:00:16] 188 let us go into Perfection how can we
[1:00:19] be perfect through the death of Christ
[1:00:24] not through joining church not through
[1:00:25] through any good works what we do that's
[1:00:28] all all right not because we were
[1:00:31] baptized this way or that way not
[1:00:34] because that we've been healed by laying
[1:00:37] on our hands not because of any of those
[1:00:40] things these any of these other things
[1:00:43] we believe in the death Burl and the
[1:00:45] resurrection right where we going
[1:00:48] paragraph
[1:00:50] 209 chapter 6 let's go on to Perfection
[1:00:54] now we got that this morning
[1:00:57] morning how that we're
[1:00:59] perfected perfected absolutely spotless
[1:01:02] and blameless not one sin on us are we
[1:01:07] above Temptation never do we sin every
[1:01:10] day yes sir but yet we are perfected see
[1:01:13] now that's going
[1:01:14] on
[1:01:16] why it's not just under understanding
[1:01:20] that Jesus saved
[1:01:23] us but understanding that by being in
[1:01:26] Jesus Christ we become Perfect Right
[1:01:29] trying to inter relate just a little bit
[1:01:31] to you cuz I'll come back to
[1:01:39] this turn over and look at number eight
[1:01:42] on your notes Hebrews chapter 6 and
[1:01:47] 7 57 9:15 the morning service paragraph
[1:01:51] 254
[1:01:54] 255 continued reading
[1:01:56] then in last Sunday we takeen leaving
[1:01:58] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[1:01:59] in the sixth chapter we read this let us
[1:02:01] go into Perfection and we found out that
[1:02:04] the people today in many churches along
[1:02:07] with the brandham Tabernacle and
[1:02:09] different
[1:02:12] ones
[1:02:14] oh now look what he says we late too
[1:02:17] much studying on studying about the
[1:02:20] principles of
[1:02:24] Christ brother brandham what do you mean
[1:02:28] that we lay too much
[1:02:34] emphasis We Lay too much study about the
[1:02:37] principles of
[1:02:40] Christ he was the son of
[1:02:43] Abraham he was the son of of of so and
[1:02:46] so and on back to genealogies but the
[1:02:48] Bible said let us lay aside those things
[1:02:51] and go on to
[1:02:53] Perfection now that's getting down in
[1:02:55] are deep where you live at folks right
[1:02:59] cuz without a revelation what are you
[1:03:00] going to
[1:03:02] say
[1:03:03] right first you must know the
[1:03:07] doctrine because he said leaving the
[1:03:11] principles and then we must know all
[1:03:13] these
[1:03:15] things then let's lay them aside he said
[1:03:18] of resurrection of the Dead lay on hand
[1:03:20] baptism and all those dead articles of
[1:03:24] God
[1:03:27] and yet they have no life in
[1:03:30] them but the church today just goes to
[1:03:34] those things oh we believe the deity of
[1:03:36] Christ we believe in the water baptism
[1:03:39] we yes sir laying on our hands in other
[1:03:41] words let me put one in here we believe
[1:03:43] the message you know Paul said we do all
[1:03:47] of this we'll do all of this if God
[1:03:49] permits but in the face of all of that
[1:03:52] let's lay aside lay it aside now and
[1:03:55] going to Perfection the church cannot be
[1:03:57] perfected through organization it gets
[1:03:59] further away from God all the time or
[1:04:01] further away from each other we draw
[1:04:04] barriers we separate ourselves seemingly
[1:04:06] not having the faith but then we leave
[1:04:10] those principles of Doctrine if we move
[1:04:13] on to Perfection then those little
[1:04:16] things become of not much use we go into
[1:04:19] a
[1:04:21] relationship
[1:04:23] y now what's going on to perfection we
[1:04:26] go into a
[1:04:28] relationship see it's not arguing in the
[1:04:31] head of the doctrines right right and we
[1:04:36] find that the only way that we can be
[1:04:38] perfect perfected is to be in Christ and
[1:04:40] you find out then by the teachings of
[1:04:42] the Bible how that we get into Christ
[1:04:45] not by water baptism not by laying on
[1:04:46] the hands not by teaching of teach not
[1:04:49] by teaching but by one Spirit we're all
[1:04:52] baptized into one body and become
[1:04:53] perfected through his suffering then we
[1:04:56] look different we think different we act
[1:04:57] different we live different not because
[1:05:00] it's a Duty or we belong to church but
[1:05:03] because the love that God has shed
[1:05:05] abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost
[1:05:09] that makes us fellow citizens of the
[1:05:11] kingdom of God then there's no
[1:05:12] denominations or barriers in that we're
[1:05:16] all we're all one great
[1:05:20] body okay paragraph
[1:05:24] 179 chapter 5 and 6 Hebrews 1957 908 now
[1:05:29] you brand them
[1:05:31] Tabernacle I know we have healings
[1:05:35] that's wonderful we have visions oh that
[1:05:39] that's fine and you can have spiritual
[1:05:41] dreams and sometimes they're not
[1:05:44] spiritual dreams and sometimes we we try
[1:05:47] to help the poor we do all that we can
[1:05:51] that's all right but that's not we're
[1:05:54] not what we're talking about now we're
[1:05:56] entering into another
[1:05:59] phase leave the doctrine oh yes we got
[1:06:02] the doctrine of Christ we believe he was
[1:06:05] the son of God and virgin born we
[1:06:07] believe that with all these things that
[1:06:10] is wonderful but leaving that let's go
[1:06:13] on to
[1:06:16] Perfection
[1:06:19] okay I won't get to the rest part of it
[1:06:21] so I'll take that up this
[1:06:24] evening
[1:06:26] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:06:28] of Christ let us go on to Perfection
[1:06:34] amen I hope you understand what Paul was
[1:06:37] saying what brother Randon was
[1:06:40] saying but you never leave the word of
[1:06:43] God that's right that is your principle
[1:06:45] your beginning your foundation you
[1:06:47] always tie everything to that and that's
[1:06:50] where I see the people of the message
[1:06:51] the problem is they can't put their
[1:06:53] Doctrine back to the principal
[1:06:56] that's you know go back in the word of
[1:06:58] God and take the word of God so they got
[1:06:59] their ideas and on across all right but
[1:07:02] now I have no problem with that my
[1:07:03] problem is me and
[1:07:06] you and as I sit there a moment ago then
[1:07:09] why would you be afraid of the teaching
[1:07:12] of the seals uh Daniel 70
[1:07:15] weeks uh marriage and
[1:07:18] divorce uh what else why would you be
[1:07:21] afraid of it
[1:07:22] right right man my be your idea well
[1:07:26] let's come and let's see if it was my
[1:07:28] idea I'll be glad to sit I talk with
[1:07:31] anybody about what I've
[1:07:35] preached and let's see if that's what
[1:07:37] brother Ram said
[1:07:39] right well that's your idea what brother
[1:07:41] bram's
[1:07:46] idea I mean you ain't going to convert
[1:07:48] nobody but by preaching the truth to
[1:07:50] them it takes God to convert
[1:07:53] people ain't no way to convert nobody to
[1:07:56] any if you do then they just reconvert
[1:07:58] You by deprogramming you you know like
[1:08:02] brother would used to say you get them
[1:08:04] in with the hot dog they'll get them out
[1:08:06] with a
[1:08:11] hamburger but you see church if you and
[1:08:13] I don't go
[1:08:16] on even what we have taught and been
[1:08:20] taught can become dead works right amen
[1:08:30] dead
[1:08:32] works it can become carnal reform or we
[1:08:37] can show that we're still into
[1:08:39] Reformation CU you see if we don't go to
[1:08:42] a
[1:08:42] change you know what's wrong with us
[1:08:45] Reformation right right oh no we're not
[1:08:47] in the age of reformation I don't care
[1:08:49] what you say that's
[1:08:53] right that's right amen message is
[1:08:56] Reformation to most
[1:08:58] people No it's h dress clothes Etc a big
[1:09:01] part of them then it's all kind of this
[1:09:03] and then it's just jumps up and becomes
[1:09:05] all kind of false doctrines to other
[1:09:07] that ain't got nothing to do with you
[1:09:08] and I amen ain't thing in the world to
[1:09:10] do with you and me right
[1:09:14] amen it's whether or not Lula has dead
[1:09:16] works oh my
[1:09:19] right the prophet said that the the
[1:09:22] Pentecostals was doing good with what he
[1:09:24] say in the seal book he said they
[1:09:26] cabbage down on it right that's right so
[1:09:30] you and I can do that and say look what
[1:09:33] we've got look at the message we've got
[1:09:35] look how it's been preached to us and we
[1:09:38] can cabbage down on it of course that's
[1:09:40] what a lot of people thinks today we've
[1:09:45] done
[1:09:47] okay
[1:09:49] right right A lot of people think maybe
[1:09:51] some of you if you don't move on that
[1:09:53] all we've done is just cabbage down
[1:10:01] that's up to
[1:10:04] you because like I said I can't convert
[1:10:06] you
[1:10:08] right that's what I've said you think
[1:10:11] right now that I've dropped
[1:10:15] back you think that I've come up and
[1:10:17] I've dropped
[1:10:18] back to a very low
[1:10:24] form
[1:10:29] if I was you i' change you
[1:10:33] thinking we had and drop
[1:10:36] back we've taken one giant
[1:10:39] step I told you the other night what I
[1:10:42] believed I went back and listen to that
[1:10:44] two or three times two times T
[1:10:47] not I said I believe the headstone is
[1:10:49] here to bring his own message come
[1:10:51] on now it ain't going to be no different
[1:10:53] than Brother randam come on now he
[1:10:54] brought the message so now you think
[1:10:56] that brother Dale was saying The
[1:10:57] Headstone going to bring his message
[1:10:59] going to be something different brother
[1:11:00] randam then I'm sorry for your soul that
[1:11:02] needs woring by the water of the
[1:11:06] word that we went this long and you
[1:11:08] think that's where we would be
[1:11:11] heading but you see I believe the
[1:11:13] headstone Here
[1:11:15] Am cuz the hi and body of the Prophet
[1:11:17] said you not in the last days to bring
[1:11:18] the message the message can't be
[1:11:20] anything contrary to brother
[1:11:21] brandham but if we don't take brother
[1:11:23] bram's message and go on to Perfection
[1:11:26] come on
[1:11:27] brother now remember brother bradam
[1:11:31] whether or not you believe in a return
[1:11:32] Ministry or whatever you believe now
[1:11:34] it's no problem with me cuz I don't it's
[1:11:37] nothing to me right you believe in a
[1:11:39] return Ministry brother randam at this
[1:11:41] time is in the grave righten come on now
[1:11:44] you believe in return Ministry okay he's
[1:11:47] in the grave right so then something's
[1:11:49] got to bring him out of the Grave that's
[1:11:51] exactly
[1:11:52] right y see because you're not just
[1:11:55] playing games with me I don't play
[1:11:58] games I believe in return ministry
[1:12:01] that's sir I believe in the resurrection
[1:12:04] brother Brandon will be the first in
[1:12:05] that Resurrection yes amen yes sir but
[1:12:08] it's that's what's keeping him from
[1:12:10] what's keeping you in ey from a change
[1:12:12] right now is because we're not to where
[1:12:14] he
[1:12:15] was we can have the faith of the
[1:12:18] fathers we can stand in higher places
[1:12:21] but until we reach the position as the
[1:12:23] bride of Christ around the world not one
[1:12:27] individual but as the bride of Christ
[1:12:29] around the world becomes one with that
[1:12:31] message he brought then he'll come up
[1:12:32] out of the gra that's right amen that's
[1:12:35] right I believe that and I believe he
[1:12:37] can preach to us after he raises
[1:12:40] too but it won't be a message of
[1:12:43] redemption
[1:12:47] right and I believe the headstone is
[1:12:49] here bringing its own message
[1:12:53] amen and see then I would
[1:12:55] be if I was you I would listen but not
[1:12:59] listen with the ears of trying
[1:13:04] to play
[1:13:06] games but to see if we are
[1:13:12] progressing instead of saying we're only
[1:13:15] playing around yeah I don't generally
[1:13:19] talk this way to years
[1:13:20] so i' listen for
[1:13:23] you we can take what we've heard of R
[1:13:26] R's message and we can make it carnal
[1:13:28] reform
[1:13:30] right that doesn't mean we're lost is
[1:13:33] Luther and Wesley them
[1:13:35] lost is the Pentecost you know the're
[1:13:38] genuine are they lost no no no no come
[1:13:42] on but they went into the grave because
[1:13:44] of carnal
[1:13:50] reform therefore leaving the principles
[1:13:53] of the
[1:13:54] seals
[1:13:57] M
[1:14:00] oh of Daniel 70 weeks there you
[1:14:05] go the
[1:14:07] Rapture let us go on to Perfection until
[1:14:11] we
[1:14:12] manifest what that Prophet has
[1:14:16] taught in our hearts and
[1:14:19] lives let's stand come
[1:14:23] over don't make it dead
