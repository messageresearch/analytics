========================================

thank you all right get get over the nervousness right quick um I want to say this first my brother um my brother in Christ I was talking to him the other day and he said um he didn't know this was on my heart but I sometime I want to come up and testify but then that little feeling come over me like I want I want people think I'm prideful and it's all about me it's not but that came over me and um I was struggling for a while so my brother he didn't he didn't know I was going through this for a while so he said um he start saying he said you know sometime when you in church Satan make you feel like uh you know it's too much if you come up and testify he said but you know what you know what he tell everybody else that God isn't moving I said wow I didn't think about it that way you know so I said well I'm going make it my point to start trying to testify more all right so uh I had a customer I'm not with him anymore and uh a while ago I made a vow to God about something and um the lifestyle I was in when I was growing up I I went down the wrong lane and I got involved in prostitution and when I was dealing with different people I would see men give stuff to women they act like they care about you but they would give stuff to women and then when they get tired of you they move on to the next so that affected me that with my relationship with men I start feeling like oh they don't really mean what they say cuz they're just going to move on to the next so I couldn't respect gifts anymore and even up to this day I struggle with that like if somebody give me something not really a woman but if a man would give me something I would struggle with does he mean it or is it just you know that that just crazy feeling so anyway I was at a um the lifestyle God just got me out of when I came back to Christ I had certain I was dealing with a man and that's who I got my youngest son by and um he gave me a necklace and and it was a very nice necklace and I'm not really in the jury that much like I was but he gave me a necklace and when I came to Christ when God started dealing with me I got rid of it because it start I just didn't you know wasn't right I felt that way so I got rid of it and um I told God I said Lord I'm not accepting any more jury from any man unless it's my husband so um I kind of said it and I forgot about it well I was at a customer house and he said um one day I was I was cleaning up and he came in there he said' do you wear jewry I said' uh I said' no not really not too much anymore and I kind of told him um I always was sharing my testimony with him about my past and stuff and how God delivered me so I said um I said no I really don't wear a jewelry like that no more I said um and plus I'm healing over a lot of things too so if I accept anything it's going to be from my husband that's what I told the Lord so anyway I kind of left it at that and he called me he said hey come here for a minute um come sit right here so in my mind I'm like oh God you know okay what what what what you know sit in this chair just sit right here I'm like well what I don't like surprises he said well just sit right here I got something for you so in my mind I'm like oh Jesus you know help me whatever this about to be you know so I sat down and he came up from behind and put something on my neck and it's like a um a very pretty necklace so I'm like oh God I'm not really into it I'm not I don't need you know I just he said well I just want to help you to heal you know and I I appreciate your walk with Christ and I've been noticing how you know good you're doing and you know I'm like okay so my I'm reasoning I said well you know the Bible do say know at least you do under me you do it to you know you do it under God so I said maybe I can accept it under that but I got up and I said well thank you so I'm moving around in I'm moving around in the um I I get up and I go in the bathroom and everything and I'm looking at this necklace on my neck and it's glistening and it's shining I'm like man it's just it's funny I don't even feel right but it's a nice necklace you know it's shining and glistening and I said man but it don't feel right it feel heavy and I I feel burdening with it on so um I'm like well I don't want to hurt his feeling but anyway I was like well maybe I can just give it to Isaac or something you know so something came into my mind I was like man you remember that vow you made about you're not going to accept any jury from any man right that's not your husband so I was like oh yeah I did say that so um I was like okay well I'm going have to give it back to him so I took it off well first of all I was like man this necklace feels so heavy on my neck I'm feeling I'm I'm going through all these different emotions about it I said I ain't even got out the house yet it's been 10 minutes and I don't even the necklace feel heavy you know so um I said well I'm not going I'm not going to accept it I just took it off and I put it back in the box and um I went back in there where he was I said can I talk to you for a minute he said uh sure I said well I can't accept this um I said I I just want to remind you I made a vow to the Lord I said maybe if you was a female it might have been different I might have felt that a little different about it but you're a man and I told God I wouldn't accept it from any man that's not my husband usand so he said well you know I'm giving it to you as a gift and you know D I said well no I I can't do it so left it at that and that was it but um I just want to say God will test you when you make a vow to him somehow it'll come back around and you'll be tested based on what you told him you know so I thought about that like wow if you're going to make a vow he will come back around somehow and see if you really meant what you said so that's it you thank you sister Anna you have a song of course than [Music] do not [Music] t [Music] t [Music] [Music] to who made to King [Music] t [Music] t willing will [Music] my [Music] be [Music] sh to hallelu [Music] hallana true [Music] [Applause] good job amen Sister Mary you said she has a

for so many things y'all don't understand and she loves us so much oh my God God forgive me Jesus I'm so sorry anyway so um I've been having this um since I sung the last time I've been happy for some reason I don't know why I've just been happy and um I'm starting to understand how God works and things like that and um I've been there done that like um sister Rebecca said you know prostitution and all I never did that but you know I've been there I lived in Atlant I lived all that life but let me tell you all you young people you can have all the money in the world but that's nothing it's

tonight if you have your Bibles we're going to go Genesis chapter 37 and uh want to look at a little thought tonight but uh want to say uh I appreciate all of the all all of the Brethren here our deacons and the work they put in amen and all the other ones the accounting firm of Bonnet duret Roberts counting the counting the votes and and our uh our new pastor here appreciate him amen so uh I want to look at a little thought tonight um this is uh looking at the life of Joseph but uh I was I was reading something and uh this this thought come to me and uh I I like this but uh Broken Dreams to God's vision and uh before we read the scripture not can y'all see that does that look good does that look okay well good I trying to make sure it got big enough but then the problem is is you got to keep making and and PowerPoint you got to keep making more screens because you just got to keep make adding more of them because everything gets so large you got to keep changing everything I can scroll sideways so and the problem is is the problem I was having is usually on PowerPoint you can see the pre the next line of screen I can't see any of my so I don't know what so just show you just show y'all how to do this what I done was when I get to a certain spot I just put a blank screen in that's where I know that's I'm supposed to stop it's like take a break so that's that's how I figured it out but you know brother Anderson W I told I promised brother and said I was going to do this tonight so it didn't matter what I was going to do this even if I had to draw it on or Draw it on a chalkboard or something hold it up it'd be it'd be different they wouldn't be doing it in the back so uh but the Lord's good to us like where they say where there's a will there's a way amen so let's just all bow our heads and uh speak to the author tonight Heavenly Father we thank you Lord this time Lord to be in your house Lord to gather with those of like Precious faith and Lord we just pray that you have your will and way with us tonight come on them scene Lord Jesus we know that you're here because you said where two or three are gathered in my name I'm there in the midst and Lord we know that you're here we just pray that you just come and speak to each one Lord the ones that are watching in tonight Lord the ones that'll be watching later we just pray that you be with them and touch them Lord give them a blessing and Lord we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Genesis 37 beginning at verse one it says and Jacob dwell in the land where wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his Brethren and the lad was with the sons of BHA and with the sons of Zila his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a code of many colors and when his Brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his Brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his Brethren and they hated him yet the more and he said unto them here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheath arose and also stood upright and behold your sheath stood round about and made OB asence to my sheath and his Brethren said unto him shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us and shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words and he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his Brethren and said behold now that's what it's interesting you tell a dream somebody and they get mad and it's like um I ain't telling no more dreams it's like you know I'm stirring up stirring up trouble but you know you know brother R was talking about Joseph and all the midst and everything God Joseph could see in his life through the things that he went through that God was with him we know that he was a spiritual one he was a type of Christ but God began to deal with Joseph in a way that when he saw these things take place it wasn't about him but it was but he was showing them the vision of God what God's plan was but they didn't but they didn't see that they just saw he was trying to make him make something out of himself and he said I Dreamed a Dream more and behold the Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars made obeisance to me and he told it to his father and to his Brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou Hast dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth and his breath envied him but his father observed the saying amen God bless you this evening you have your seats and uh just want to look at this for a little bit and uh we all know the story of of Joseph and his and his Brethren and the life that he lived and but just to kind of give a little bit of a background and you know we look at the understanding the life of Joseph and we go back to uh looking at his mom and dad and you know you see Jacob and and Rachel and you know we see the the the situation that um when when Jacob was running from Esau and he went to go see his his uncle laan and met met some more of the family there and he began to uh as he was staying there began to uh live in fellowship with them you know laan wanted to bless him and uh wanted to have something for him and and in the midst of all that you know uh he asked him you know what kind of wages would he want and you know they worked out they worked out an agreement that Jacob was going to work because he had met Rachel and you know he was in love with her and and no doubt she was in love with him and you know he worked out a deal to work you know work the seven years that that time for uh Rachel and we know that in the midst of all that time he was working to gain Rachel you know the scripture tells us that you know it was just like a few days it just a short period of time that he worked those years to gain Rachel but we know that his father-in-law pulled a quick one on him and he ended up with Leah and you know and you know because laan said well you know that's that's not customary to for the younger one to get married before the firstborn and so you know he had to he had to take that and you know you you look at the life of of Rachel and you see that you know here you here you are because the scripture never really tells us that much about it but you think you know you are in love with this man and you know you you want to get married and then all of a sudden your sister ends up in the place that you want to be and there she is standing there looking at this situation where you know she's in my place and that's where I want to be and no doubt that was a heartbreaking thing for Rachel to be there to be in this situation that Leah's where she was at and and you know but then you know he went and Jacob went and talk to laan about it you know he's like why did you deceive me and he's like well if you want if you want Rachel you're going to have to work another seven years and so you know he he works it out where he works another seven years to gain Rachel and you you see all the way all through the scripture between laan and and Jacob there's always this contention going on we see how they're all the time working you know because even in the end Jacob stand standing up there saying you know I've worked for you for seven years for Leah and seven years for Rachel and six years for cattle and you've changed my wages 10 times right and it's like you know like they say you know don't do business with family because you know sometimes that's that's the hardest people to try to deal with but you know he worked all the way through that but you you see how that was a it was no doubt a heartbreaking situation for Rachel to be in and then when you see later on that when God recognized that Jacob loved Rachel so much more than Leah that he opened her womb and closed Rachel's when she became bar and and Leah was able to Bear children well you know that was a heartbreaking thing for Rachel to go through because here she is and and even she comes to Jacob at one time and tells him says give me children and he's like can I take the place of God that's something that God does I don't have anything in control over that but he saw that but you know when she began to cry and she had this heartbreak that she was going through this travail that she went through and after all those different five or six Sons that came through that that Leah had born and then she come up with this great idea I'll just give my handmade over to Jacob so I can have children through her and then when you if you want to see sibling rivalry you begin to read the scripture and you see and then all of a sudden Rachel says well I'm going to have children to to bring unto me through my handmade well then Leah sends her hand made to Jacob and says well I can do the exact same thing and what mean she already had children what was what was what was the motive behind doing that right but it was like it was like just like I'm this something I can stick I can stick you with you know I can put this in front of you you know it's just like always time poking and so here she is she's doing this but you know it never satisfied Rachel she still had that longing for children and she after after she went through all this and all the things that she had went through and saw all these things then the scripture tells us that God opened the womb of Rachel because he hearkened unto her because of what she had been through she had seen all these things and he opened her up opened up her womb and she brought forth a son after all she had been through all the struggles all the pain all this and she brings forth a son Joseph and she was so happy that she received a son Joseph and she said now God has rolled away my reproach because now I'm able to bring bring forth children and you know we look at we look at the great matriarchs of of the Old Testament of of the children of Israel we look at the lives that they live but you know you look at the struggle and the pain that she went through I mean here's here is a a woman woman that had went through all of this and no doubt she had spent many nights walking away crying because she wanted something and everybody else had that she didn't have and here she is but she was able to bring forth the son and then she brings forth one son and the scripture tells us that Jacob loved Joseph more than he loved any of the rest of them now you know parents you know they always talk about parents not having favorites well you know what Jacob didn't hold that back he didn't he didn't try to hide the fact that he didn't have a favorite oh I just love all my children the same you know but Jacob saw there was something special about Joseph the script you know brother Brown said one time he was talking about all the all the Patriarchs were good men but he said there was something different there was something special about Joseph he was a he was a special man but you know Jacob saw all of that and here she was she went Rachel went through all this brought forth a son and you you look at here he here he was she she brought forth this son watched him grow up to be 17 years old the scripture here talks about him being 17 years old just just in the prime of his Youth and you know his his father had give him a a coat of many colors but God had had a work for him to do and had a special place for him and we know that through the scripture God began to show him things and he began to speak to the family of the things that he had seen and you know as he begins to tell about the dreams that he saw about what was going to take place and you know then everybody be his his brothers didn't like him to begin with because you know he was he was the like the youngest and you know that's Daddy's favorite he's Daddy's pet and you know he can't ever do any wrong and you know then you know he always gets the best of everything you know Dad gives him this coat of many colors and none of the rest of us you know we just get hand-me-downs or whatever else but you know Dad gives him the top knot stuff and you know we we just do without you know we like the old saying is we're playing second fiddle to a Ste guitar and you know you look at you look at the kind of condition that's this all goes through and you know even you know that it just it just builds up more and more and more to the you know they they couldn't even talk to him they couldn't talk to him in a pleasant tone they they W have anything to do with him but you know when when Jo when Jacob sent Joseph down there to send him to go check on his Brethren and and and see them to check on where the where the flocks were and everything and he went down there and you got you got to think think them them boys them boys hated him they were ready boys was like thank you Daddy he done something for me and it's like we get rid of him and Reuben stood up and we know the scripture Ruben stood up and said you know what we can't kill him now we can get rid of him we can do something to him and he's like we put him in the pit cuz he was just trying to get their anger under control but you know when when they when ru was gone and had his back turned next thing you know they had him sold into into slavery and you look and you look at the life of Rachel here's Rachel she'd went through all this struggle all this pain she's she has a son only son she's ever had 17 years old and next thing you know her sons uh and uh nephews since Leah and Rachel were sisters so sound like something come out of Alabama but um you see you see these brother but but these Sons came back with an evil report and they had killed they had killed a kid and had dipped the coat of many colors in Blood and brought back this evil report to her and here she here she is after she'd went through all of this pain all this struggle all of this time and they saying you know here she is the son that she had longed for all this time was gone from her and do you know that in the scripture you know there's no place in the scripture you know Rachel never knew what happened to him she never learned what happened to him she went she went to her grave thinking that he died and never knew the truth she had she had another son later on and and here she was waiting to have another son going after after Leah had all these Sons After the handmaids had sons all the things that they had done she lost the one thing she wanted was a son he's gone God blesses her again you know what she didn't even get to raise him she named him benomi the son of my morning she dies in childh birth Jacob names him Benjamin so here's Rachel and she never she never comes to the place that she wants to come to right and can you imagine here's here's Joseph growing up away from everybody and then when he finds out you know what your mom passed away she only had two sons you and she never never saw you grow up she never saw what took place and your son and your brother she died giving him birth and you see and you see the Heartbreak and the and the TR troubles and and the trials that she went through and no and no doubt you see the life that Joseph lived and it had you know because it it's a it has an effect on everybody and here and here's Joseph being sold by Brethren and here here he is being sold into a foreign country and no and no you don't know anybody and you don't know the customs and and you know maybe every once in a while he's in he's in Piper's house and maybe every once in a while he'll see somebody that's a Hebrew and he understands the language and he's like hey you know there's somebody from my part of the world but most of the time it's it's all this heathenism and all kinds of other things that he lived with but you know what God had called Joseph to a place and called him into this into this and you know it was it wasn't the the place that he wanted to be there's there's there's no you know you know who wants to be sold into slavery by your brethren right and go and living in a Strange Land with strange food and strange customs and all that and not having your own freedom but you know the one thing about Joseph Joseph was the son of prosperity everywhere he went he it prospered God was with him and God prospered his hand in everything he did am right when he went into Piper's house and and it showed the scripture tells us that Piper knew that God was with with Joseph and he put him over everything put him over the whole house and here he is taking over everything and he controlled everything and you know here's Piper I don't have to to worry about what takes place in my house because Joseph is in charge but you know what after all the things that all the struggles and the strain and the and the problems that Joseph had went through his life was just beginning his troubles were just beginning he thinks well guess what I'm in a good place now and everything's starting to work out now he's got now he's got this woman after him and she didn't come she didn't come you know Piper's wife didn't just come one time you know it was constantly constantly constantly and he had to put up with that every single day and having to having to keep his distance away from her until she put his took the move on him and next thing you know he's in prison yeah here he is he's he's locked up well you know what it just goes from bad to worse he just keeps you know because you know it's it's just like one thing after another after another yeah and it never changes and it just continues to get worse but we see how all this takes place as as it continued to unfold that when when he was in in the prison and here here he is going into this prison and you know nothing looks like looks like it the way that you want it to go but you know in the midst of all that the Prisoners the prison guards the captains when they saw Joseph God showed them that Joseph was a right man he was a man of prosperity and all of a sudden when he come to that place that God put him over everything of the prison he was put in all in in charge of everything and here he is being in charge of all this and and and when he saw all the place that he had been then you know when they see all in the time that he was there and he took over the prison still being a prisoner and you you think about somebody you know like like they always say that the the patients running the Asylum well here you got here you got the prisoners running the prison but all of a sudden this prison begins to uh Prosper here all these things taking place because they saw what kind of man Joseph was and you know you you look at all the things that he went through and all all the struggles and the strains and and all these type things and and you look at all this like what what good would come out of this well I don't I don't see any I don't see how any of this would would be any good I don't see how any of this would ever come to anything well in the midst of all of that you see that here comes the Baker and the Butler and all of a sudden here come here comes these men that are there that are placed in this situation you know here's here's Joseph in this situation and here these men have dreams and they're trying to understand what's going to take place and they're wanting to know what did these dreams mean and they're looking for somebody that can interpret this and understand these things and you know it's really interesting because you know Joseph never tells them that you know I can do these things he said no but I know one that can because you know God is the one that can reveal these things God's the one that reveals dreams and makes Visions known and so when he began to make these things on and then all of a sudden here he comes and and the Butler and the baker you know they come and they tell him their dreams about what's going to take place and here they are when they come and and so he tells the butler you know you're going to be restored because the dream shows that you're coming back to the place that you were formerly and you're going to be beside the Pharaoh and you're going to be handing him his cup and all those things and you're going to see how all that that you'll be restored but the baker was going to lose his life because he was because the dream that he said you know he saw the bread being eaten and all the birds devouring everything he's like well you're it's a loss for you and but but you know he saw what took place and all of a sudden you know there's Joseph in the in the in in the prison and in the midst of all that and he tells he tells the butler he said when you come back and you're restored don't forget about me amen don't forget what I've done don't forget what's taking place but you know what nobody nobody remember Joseph so he's back in the same place doing the same thing and he's like man I thought this was going to be the way it's going to work out I thought this was going to be my way out I thought this was the ticket and you know what he's down there and now it's just right back to the same old thing same old grind everything looks the same and don't look like like anything's going to change and it don't look don't look like there's anything any promise in any of that but you know what God was still dealing with Joseph God still had his hand on Joseph and at that time at a certain appointed time God began to deal with the Pharaoh and began to tell Pharaoh listen through the dream you know he began to deal with him in these dreams and he saw the the ears of corn that were large and the small ones and all dried up and everything and and seeing the cattle how they're how they're fat and you know good got seven good ones we got seven bad ones and the and the bad ones eat up the good ones and nothing changes and and he's trying to figure out and understand what all this means and you know here he is when when the Lord begins to deal with him in these dreams he's looking for somebody that can answer these dreams and you know what none of none of the the the prophets of of Egypt none of none of the wise men none of none of any of those learned men could answer the question that he had and he began to look Pharaoh's like is there anybody in the Kingdom that can answer this is there anybody that can come and answer these questions I've got to because I've got to have an answer for this and that's when the butler comes back and says oh yeah God forgive me my faults but you know what there was a man that done that just exact same thing I've seen him do that exact same thing I've seen it take place because he answered mine he answered my dreams and so they sent for Joseph to come and when Joseph came he began to speak to the Pharaoh and tell him what was going to take place listen you're going to have good years ahead of you you're going to be blessed the next seven years you're going to see great reaps great harvest but the problem is is beyond those seven years there's going to be seven years of famine that's never you've never seen these years of famine that's coming on right and now's the time to prepare for those seven years of famine that's coming amen and when he said you got to prepare then when Pharaoh saw that Joseph told him said you need to find somebody that you can put in place that has wisdom and understanding that can stand in the place and guide the people and do what needs to be done and Pharaoh's looking around and he's like guess what I don't think we're going to find anybody that's going to be qualified to do this job as the man that's just brought us the word of what to do so then he turns to Joseph and he tells Joseph listen Joseph you're going to be my right-hand man you're going to be second in all of the Kingdom only in the in the throne will I be greater than you but in every other aspect you're going to be great you're going to have the way to lead the people and however these people people will go from here will be your way what you tell them to do that's how they'll go and he and so he begins to lead the people and tell them store up the food you need to prepare now because Now's the Time to prepare and when you get ready because the years are coming that are going to be lean and because you see these things that's going to take place you've got to get ready now amen and have you got ready now because I I I wanted to I I wanted to say because I I'm sure y'all probably understand where I'm going with all this because it's not too hard amen but I just want I just want to say you know because you know you look back over your life and you know what I've been in prison and I've been in Dungeons and I've been in famines and I've been in heartache but let me tell you I come to a place I've been I've been brought to a place where there's plenty I have been blessed above measure amen I I I just tell you what my my experience is what what I see what God's done for me to bring bring us to this place to to have the ministry that we've had to see the things that we've seen and the things that we've heard God has blessed us to be hereen but you know things happen when things happen we don't understand why it happens but you know what God's hand is still in it and all of the struggles and the pain and the problems whatever it is God's still in it just as I was speaking last time when we were talking about the Potter see when the when the clay is on the wheel and he's working it and he and the clay is enduring all of the pressure and all those things that has to be done it's whatever's in The Potter's mind is coming to be made brought forth because you know we don't see what what's in The Potter's mind we don't see but you know what he sees what he's going to do just like just like when brother bam was speaking of Michelangelo and Michelangelo was looking at singing Moses he saw that great piece of granite there of marble and he saw Moses and when he saw Moses he said how did you get Moses out of that he said I chipped away everything that was in Moses that wasn't in the vision that I saw and he said when I began to heue all of the way away everything that wasn't Moses then Moses came forth because it was exactly the vision that he had of Moses and he was so moved by the vision that Michelangelo had of Moses that he struck Moses and told him to speak and that's what brother Ram said and that's what made it the Masterpiece why because it was exactly what God had in what Moses Michelangelo had in his mind and it's the same way with you and I we we see the struggles and the pain and the heartache well guess what it God's still in control and it's still God's plan amen that's right brother and know and so we see these things well then guess what God brings up another man in our day now nobody no y'all forgive me but you know nobody nobody wants to see what happened nobody nobody wanted to lose brother Dale right nobody no I mean right who who would have traded places with him as many times as he stood for us he's been Our Shepherd he's been our intercessor yes sir amen he's he's he's been our backbone he's been everything we've had need of but you know what God does all things right and God does all things in his own time and God don't God don't God don't ask us our opinion right and he don't he don't want he don't want any of our ideas CU he said my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts you know because we don't we're not even in the same ballpark as him but you see but you see what God but he left us something I mean I I thank God that you know when you when you look back all through through history when you when you look when you look at all through the history of of the of the church and and through the Bible you know God blessed us to live in this day because the scripture tells us in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and here and here we are in this day you know those people back there they never got to hear Paul right Paul wrote them letters and sent them but you know there some people they never saw Paul's face there's people that never saw Peter's face all all they had was some scroll some parchment that had been written on by somebody and had sent them and somebody stood up and read them what Paul wrote right and that's all they had all of the all the way down through history you look at all these people what they what they didn't have but look and our day we were we were blessed to be in this day we actually get to hear Brother bram's voice all we because you know to me that literally is the voice of God because it's God behind that voice it's God veiled behind the human flesh and it was God speaking to us through a a five foot whatever Kian I mean there was there was nothing there was nothing about brother brandham you know he was he wasn't a looker he wasn't handsome you know you look at a short man with bald holding hair and bad teeth and his HS and totes and fetch and carry and didn't know how half the words couldn't speak good English but you know what God used that man and he used that man to speak to us and he spoke to a group of people that were predestined to hear that voice in this day and it was move us to the place where God called us to he he called every every group to the to their place and they and they ran their race because there was a group that picked up that message just from like when Paul preached his message and they ran with the message that Paul had and then the next thing you know there was one that came on and irenius came and began to carry the gospel further beyond that when all of the when all of the false Doctrine began to come in and creep in and they began to try to turn them away from what Paul said but there were some that were full of the Holy Ghost that stood up and began to Pro claim exactly what Paul said and even even when you go back and look in the in the in the history they are parts of the history that back then there's no written record of it but irenius stands up and quotes exactly what the Bible says in Mark 16 I believe it is here these are these men are full of the Holy Ghost pointing back to what the the apostles had preached why because there's always somebody that has a voice that's standing up and proclaiming ex what what God had said no matter how many devils in Hell began to stand up and come against it and proclaiming that it was wrong and it was false there was somebody that stood up and was given the word of God and they spoke by the Holy Ghost and told the people exactly what the truth was and here we are today sitting here with 1100 plus sermons of brother brandham speaking to us thus sayith the Lord and we have books and tapes and we have every kind of social media and every kind of form of media there is in the world that has this message on it and sometimes we fail to realize because sometimes we allow this to become common to us well because sometimes we we allow the devil to beat us down don't realize that we have everything that we have need of has been given to us in this Earthly Journey because we've had we've had a Vindicated message come we've had a Vindicated Prophet come in our day and began to un unfold these messages to us and tell us exactly what the scripture says and what happened because when when the prophet's message came he called a five-fold Ministry to pick up this message why because even in the Old Testament God had men that were under Moses that done the work he had he had a high priest he had a priesthood he had Levites that were called to do a job why because Moses couldn't do it all but it wasn't moses' job to do it all they were men that were ordained and anointed to do a job and that's what they were called to do and then when he continues on he always had prophets all the way down his through history that he spoke to but in the end time Mo Paul picks it up and he begins to talk about and he call and he gave some yeah right Apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists they are to do the work of the of the to the ministry they are the five-fold ministry why because they are to do this work to continue on until the people are perfected so there is a work that has to be done well guess what there's the same thing that took place under Paul's Ministry there was men that were called to do the exact same thing then in our day when brother BR brother brandham never done away with a fivefold Ministry but God called a group of men under the fivefold ministry that they were called to come to this place that they were going to take this message and carry it on yes that's right amen there was a group that would carry this message on that would that would make the word known to the people right and if you don't have and if you don't see that it takes a fivefold Ministry you're missing a portion of the word you're missing an important part an important aspect of the word you're missing out on what needs to be done because if you can see that you've got to be under headship right and it's not like it's not like people like to make it like it's an umbrella well you know what I can just run around under this big umbrella cuz this big umbrella is my headship I just run around and do no you've got to have a place right amen you've got to be you've got to be settled You' got to be established because you know the Bible says you know we are to be sitting in Heavenly places that means there's a position brother R said it's your position in Christ so there's a position for you to be in you know it's you know so it's not all willy-nilly and just you know whatever but there's a place for you to be then when brother bam said you know you need to find you a pastor and get under him because he's or of God to lead you through well then there was they were they were God called pastors there's God called evangelists but you know and and teachers but you've got to have a pastor you've got to sit under a pastor that knows how because and I thank God that we have had a pastor we've we've had one of the best in the world but you know me tell you but God has has blessed us but you know not only do we have all of those sermons that brother Brandon preached but you know we still got all the messages that brother Dale preached so you know what when all of that was done away when just because he's not up here preaching anymore doesn't mean you can let me tell you there's a lot of people around the world they're still gleaning right God may take his man but he don't take it but he don't take that anointing he don't take he don't take that word away but you know what I I you know I don't know the future I don't know but you know what if brother Dale has done his part we praise God I want to thank God for what he's done he done his portion he done what God called him to do and if he never preaches another sermon then we can say we've heard the word pure and unadulterated the word has been preached in its entire I believe in the entirety in the truth and you know we've had that we've got the we've got the tapes we've got all of I mean praise God I mean you think you know we don't even get to see brother brandom but we get to hear him but here we still got videos of brother Dale that we can we can hear all these things but when we see all these things take place here here we are we've received all this well if if if things change if if things happen well guess what as brother Dale told us and I've said many times it's not a man leading this church it wasn't a man in the beginning and it's not a man now that's right and so if God has been leading us all this time then guess what he will continue to lead us hallelujah it's still God in [Applause] control and that's the reason that's the reason why I I I want to say I appreciate brother Wade I appreciate his servant's heart I know it's a I know it's a struggle but I appreciate him and I believe God called him I believe this I believe this is God's place I think this is God's plan and God has blessed us so we don't know what with what the future holds but we know who holds the future we know what lies ahead because because you know what God's led us today he'll lead us tomorrow he'll lead us the next day yeah there might be some changes on I don't know what's going to take place but you know anytime anything changes there's always changes just like brother Wade said he said I'm not he said I'm not my dad and I can't be my dad but he's going to be who God called him to be thank you Lord exactly and and I and I hope I hope this is okay amen but that's what's that's that that's what I I I want to share tonight you know we all go through hard times we all Broken Dreams we've all had them but you know what we don't see that when was all the things that was like well I don't understand why this happened I don't understand why that happened and we don't understand all these things but you know what in the midst of all that just realize God's still leading you God's vision is still in front of you in the midst of all the things that Joseph had went through Joseph was a was a perfect type of Christ that he was being led well you know what your sons and daughters of God right and guess what you're a type of Christ also yeah all the struggles and all the strain you know it's amazing when you when you look about all the things that you went through in your life and you say you know there's a lots of things you go through in life and you don't you want anybody to know right you know everybody thinks thank God for the blood it's under the blood and nobody has to know about it right but you know what it lives rentree in your mind because the devil likes to remind you of it right good at but you know the problem is is you know we have to get overcome that but see s Satan wants wants to try to hinder you with everything but thank God the blood covers these things that we don't have to worry about what took place in the past to go on forward to move on from where you were that God knew all the things that you were going to do wrong all your all your sins all your mistakes all your problems everything and you know what and God still chose you the Lord and put you in the place that he wanted you to be in that's right because you know what I don't know about you but I wouldn't I wouldn't be here today I don't because it wouldn't because I want have ended up here myself because if it was it wasn't for God's grace to us we wouldn't be here you know lots of Us come from other states and other countries and you know long way away and all we all end up in this one spot why because God knows what he's doing and it all works out and when he when he brings all these things to pass and he works all these things we all end up in this one place as one big family amen and everybody has their own faults and failures and quirks and you know and and you know lots of times you just have to overlook people that's right and I know it's kind of hard for y'all to do that um I know people say oh I've overlooked you and it's like no y'all just ignored me there no there's no way somebody this big and you overlook them so oh bless him Lord but hey you know that's a that's one of those crosses you have to bear that's but you know everything happens for a reason and everything works out the way God wants it to work out when when when here was Joseph and all of the things that Joseph had went through and all of those things and here's Joseph and the famine just all of the whole area all around was under this great Great Famine and everything was dried up everything was gone there's nothing to be had and then all of a sudden his Brethren Jacob finds out hey there's food in Egypt hey we can go get food in Egypt and and live we can we can be sustained cuz you know the one thing is they didn't know how long the the the famine was going to last they just knew that there was a Great Famine on the land because you know when the when the when his Brethren they all came and and he began to make himself known he told him we still got five years of this but when he when he came through all this and his Brethren came to get the food here they are been all through this and here they are they show up coming to get food well you know what Jake Joseph recognizes his Brethren but they don't recognize him and it's amazing here he is he's standing there and he speaking to them through an interpreter when he understands what they were saying he knows what's going on he knows who they are but they don't know him and he begins to speak to him and he begins to check them and test them to see what was going to take place when they when they came in and they're like oh we we're we're all the sons of one man and and one of our brothers is gone and we've got a younger brother and he's still at home and and you know and Joseph knows who they are but he wants to test them and he goes up there y'all a bunch of spies y'all come to spy out the famine in the land and you know and it's like oh and he you know he begins to put the screws to them a little bit you know oh and Ruben's up see see if y'all hadn't done this to Joseph we wouldn't be facing all this right look at the condition we're in right now he thinks we're a spy he's going to keep one of us and the rest of us we can go back now now he wants wants to see our younger brother and it's like Dad ain't going to like this we're not going we're not there ain't a good way this something with this but here they are there they're worried and and you know they're all talking amongst themselves trying to figure out what's going on and Joseph understands EX exactly what's going on he knows what's going to take place and he sends them out with the with their provision and to add another mystery to this mess he like we travel all this way to get food in this famine and the and the in the in the pharaoh's right-hand man he he thinks we're trouble down here he's keeping Simeon and we got to go back and then all of a sudden they open up their sacks that are full they're headed back and next thing you know was like oh great we're in trouble now all the money's in the bags so now if they catch us now they can just kill all of us they were all a bunch of Thieves it's like there ain't no there ain't no good thing coming out of all this and they go back and you know they wait till the very last minute wait till the very bitter end when there ain't no more food and they're up there arguing and trying to talk to jok it's like Dad we got to get some more food and Reuben's like Dad you can kill my two sons we got to do something Simeon still down there we got to do something and he become the shity for Benjamin we got to go down there we got to take him with us and he takes Benjamin and you know the whole way down there you know they're sweating bullets oh it was bad last time maybe it'll be better this time but it don't look good and next thing you know Joseph comes out there and he sees Benjamin and you know and he's and he's trying to make it hard on on them and he's trying to hold it together to let them know who he was and here he going through all of this and and you know then he goes to send them out and he puts his drinking cup in in Benjamin's bag you know oh man we're in trouble now we got caught but you know he went through all of that to put to show where his brothers the condition his brothers were in after all the things they had been through you know because all those years they didn't know what happened to Jacob I mean Joseph their brother's gone they don't know what happened to him he probably dead and they don't understand that years before that Vision was spoke over them amen and they don't remember there was a vision that was made and and when he went through all of that and he began and he called you know because he begins to tell his Brethren after they came back you know he began to speak to them and tell them listen I'm Joseph does my father yet live and it says and they were troubled at his sayings you know here he is he's trying to hold it together he left and wept and come back and he's trying to hold it all together and trying to tell him listen how is everything how's the family is Dad okay and they were troubled by it but you know the first thing he done was he grabbed a hold of Benjamin and he began to cry on Benjamin's shoulder and Benjamin began to cry on his and then you know he come and it says he came and he kissed each one of his Brethren and he told them he said listen he said y'all meant this to be evil y'all meant this to be for good I mean for evil for bad but you know God ordained all of this for good God done all of this to preserve life look what he's done he's he's done all this and knew what was going to take place and he worked all of this out till y'all could be here right now feasting and you didn't realize what you were facing standing right here feasting and sometimes we don't realize what what we've got that God had brought him all this way and then they brought the word back to Jacob and and they told him said listen Joseph's alive all these years you thought he was gone you thought he was dead it looks so Bleak how many years you sat there and cried and thought about your son oh if if I only knew where he was oh if he was still here just like a lot of people you know oh if brother Brandon was here oh oh if oh if if it was just like it used to be and not realizing that the same one that was here before am he's the same yesterday today and forever the one that was here in the past is here today he's still here that's right so what so what if the if the conditions changed we don't we said well it's it's it looks bad it looks bad it don't look bad to God every we we people look at the at the condition that the world is in oh it's bad it's bad you know what it looks good the scripture says when you see all these things take place look up because your Redemption Draw N why because we know these are the signs to look for because now we see the condition the world is in we see the things that are taking place but praise God we were told ahead of time what was going to take place so if we see these things taking place no matter what takes place God's in control amen amen and God is the one that's leading us you know what the same one that led us here wherever wherever you were out out in sin wherever wherever you were at come on whether you was out in a bar somewhere or you sitting on a on a church pew just as dry and dead as you could be like talk about people come to church you know it's like people just come and have sat in churches and they're just as dry as dust and people sit in there and they don't do anything and they've been there for years and all of a sudden you just walk pass them and and the dust blows off of them well because because they they they they don't know anything about the move of the spirit they've never had God lead them anywhere they just come to church and they just go through the ritual do the motions and they just come to church and it's all been dead but how many times have you sat in church and you didn't understand the first thing about what the and all you knew was what the preacher read out of the Bible because maybe you knew about that and then you don't know anything else they said it but you know what there was someday at some point in time God crossed your path and spoke to your heart and brought you up out of that deadness that coldness out of out of your Fallen estate and called you on a journey to bring you back to the place that he always wanted you to be [Music] in and all of a sudden you began to walk in in the newness that you had never seen before and you know what you began to talk to everybody around you and you know what nobody understood what you was talking about when you began just like when was Dwight Moody when he was out there and he run out into the road and you know he asked him he said do you know Grace Grace who the grace of God the amazing grace of God have you don't do you know anything about it yes and they just stand there and look at him like what but there was something that was bubbling up inside of him that I got to tell you about something when you begin to tell people that what God can do what God has done in your life what what you see what God has revealed to you and and they look at you like you got two heads it's not for everybody but you know what it crossed your path why because you were predestinated to hear it and you were predestinated to come to this place God knew that you would hear it recognize that it was Eagle food and take a hold of it and you would eat it and it would bring you to this place but well it's the same if it if he called you out of Darkness into this Marvelous Light if he started you on this journey then it's the same way he's going to continue all the way and if he started in one time then he will take you all the way to a body change amen why because if it's on the inside it's going to carry you there's a draw that takes place amen amen let's all stand have the musicians come see if there's a drawing on the inside of the deep brother R said that deep calls to the Deep he said there's a deep to respond there was something on the inside he was talking about all the way through the scripture all those men that were God called he began to show them through the word and they didn't they didn't have all they didn't have books and tapes that's right but you know they they began to hear and God began to speak to them and show them amen you know all all Moses all Moses had was what God told him all Noah had was what God told him 12 years of Noah preaching now all all Moses had cuz Moses didn't have Moses didn't have Abraham's Revelation he didn't have Isaac he didn't have ja he didn't have nobody's he didn't have his mom and daddies he just knew what everybody said but when God began to speak to him and after all the struggles Moses been through God spoke to him on the back side of the desert through a burning bush and God and brother brandom said you know we all need to have that every Minister needs to have a sacred sands on the back side of the desert a burning bush experience where it's just you and God when God begins to speak to you and deal with you right because you know what there's no there's no man that can take that and give you that right every well you know I you know because the the worst the worst thing that somebody could do the worst the worst thing I think that anybody could do in this church is try to make Sam Dell their Holy Ghost we we're just we're just going we're just going because you know what if you if you're looking at a man then you know what you're not going to make it you're not you're not going there's no stability there and all of the all of the preach ing that he done just like everybody trying to trying to look at brother brandom and and looking at a man not looking at a man looking at Jesus Christ here all the all the faults and failures that Noah had and all the things that he went through here 120 years being ridiculed all the time trying to build an ark that man need to be need to put in a straight jacket and put in a looney bin he needed a rubber room think it's going to rain well you know what all the naysayers didn't think it when it when it came time people started to see the evidence of it it was too late right when the clouds started to roll in the doors already been shut judgment had already been proclaimed amen but brothers and sisters we're standing in the Ark of Safety amen now today is the day of salvation today is the day he say Lord I don't know what to do I don't know where to go he only a prayer way all you got to do is call on him thank God he's never the phone's never busy he always answers answers always on time you can call an old song you can hear from Heaven just about any old time he's always there but God's brought us this far he's going to car carry us on I I I thank God I don't I I don't look I don't think look for things to get any better around the world right but I do think I do expect things to get better here right because you know what I believe we are going to become more and more into the image of Jesus Christ I believe that what the word says about us we're going to manifest I believe that's what God's called us to do am you're going to still have faults and failures you're going to still fall you're still going to fail you're still going to struggle but I want to give you encouragement this the last thing I'm gonna say tonight I'm gonna quit I want to give you a good word before I finish greater is he that's in you and he that's in
