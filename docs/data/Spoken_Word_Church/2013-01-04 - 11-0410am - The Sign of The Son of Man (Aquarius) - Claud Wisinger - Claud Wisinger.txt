the of his glory and praise is that right just keep your eyes on him everything will be all right with see everybody in the house of the Lord remember all the announcements that's been made and all and just keep up with what's going to happen next if you miss something go to the internet and it'll be on there but we're we're glad to have brother Claud wi singer with us today glad to have his wife with us amen here and we just want you to listen to the word of the Lord and just enjoy what God has to bring for us because that's what I believe he does amen that's the way I believe that he speak to me it's through the fivefold Min and that way I can depend upon Him can't you amen we had a good time yesterday at J jun's birthday party and actually today she's really the that her day to and sing Happy Birthday to her this afternoon you know and all but we just had a good time at it amen let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart yes brother Claud W singer comes to preach the word of the Lord unto amen Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord that's your desire Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see I want to see want to see Open the Eyes with my heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see amen I want to see how do you want to see you to see High in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy hly I LIF up I am lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Ho Holy Holy Holy Glory holy holy holy holy holy I want to see amen you know even even job wanted to go up to his house and see him knock at his door and be able to see him it's been in a a man all that from from eons of time man wanted to go see God is that right and you know the the old sages of old if they' have wanted to live they'd wanted to live in this hour you know I I I tell the church I see where I think the message churches uh are failing is that we don't really have joy in in what God has given us you know under the the fifth seal which I call the grace seal you know five in God's numerology is Grace and underneath there you know brother brandom starts talking about the stimulation of Revelation right he says that that's the wine of Joy that's right so if you have a revelation in this end time you ought to have some joy in your life and the way I teach it at our church if you don't have joy here what makes you think you're going to be there is that right because brother brandom said whatever you are here is what you're going to be over there brother brandom said the anointing in the Millennium is Joy did you know he said that so you if you can't Havey joy in your experience where you're at today then I don't I'm just I'm doubtful that you're going to be there can I just put it that way so if you want to check up on yourself when you come to church you shouldn't be frowning you shouldn't be sad and down and out you should be the happiest people you should be the people that can absolutely totally worship God because scripture says that if you're going to worship God you're going to worship you in spirit and truth you're the people that's been given the truth in this end time you're the true worshippers of the Living God is what it is so you know we should be as a a message Believers we should be a very happy happy people and that's what I really believe and I tell my church that too say hey when brother brandom said if you got the Holy Ghost you can't wait till those doors open now if you can't wait till those doors open then if you sat in that Pew you ought to be a happy people the reason you can't wait till they open is cuz you got such a joy in your life that you want to come and hear the Revelation and get that stimulation Jo is that right so that's what weed together here this is to get some wine is that right some Joy is what we've got and he's here I'm not going to preach you he's coming I'm going to declare to you he's here and he's here to reveal himself to you that's his whole purpose in being here is that right so we thank God for it I might say it's good to see each and every one of you you're lovely group I just I I like I say when I come out of the pulpit our church I just like to sit there and look the people yeah I I think this is the most beautiful people on the face of the earth I really I'm not joking when I say that you're the one to the world we the offscouring but to Jesus Christ you're the elected lady you're Miss Grace and you're the most beautiful people on the face of the Earth you really are you know what I was at the uh s I'm sorry to keep you standing if you don't mind just a minute I'm going to I'm going to hold you a while this morning I've got a lot to say okay I'm going to read a lot cuz what I'm going to say might be a little different than you've ever heard it and I want you to read along with me if you would okay and we don't read ahead of me I'm going to have him give you some handouts don't get ahead of me but when I read it we're going to read it together is that okay but I I had to cry when I was there because you know I seen brother Wade and sister June just beautiful people I mean you know and sister June you're going to understand it now when you hit 50 years old you get like brother brandom was and you start talking about when I was 20 years old and you start to look back and you're starting to get old and and you you realize how what it was wonderful the other day I put a tool chest together in my garage after I got through I couldn't get up off the floor I had to crawl over the wall to get up right and I said this is not 20 years old I remember when I was 20 years old I jump right up and just keep right on going so when you hit that 5 Mark in your life you start realizing you're not that 20-year old young man you used to be and I tell you when I seen them they were both just beautiful people weren't there and I thought you know I was happy to be here to be able to see them I would have never recognized brother Wade at 20 he is that I said brother waade I'm sorry but you know I said he looked like Jeff Foxworthy he was totally different looking I would have never guessed what he looked at 20 I am so happy to have the opportunity to see him right because one day right me and him are going to see each other at 20 years old just a beautiful young man a beautiful young and not that they're not that way now but time plays tricks on you did you know that I didn't look like this when I was 20 years old my wife said I'm twice the man she married I weighed 130 lb and she's not far from being right so that's what she tells people at the church so it was just wonderful to be able to see those beautiful young people uh and man it just kind of man it just takes you back don't it when you get up our age over the 50s then you say man I can remember when I was was young like that and you know it's not just a uh a myth it we are going back right Amen to 20year old men and women whatever the prime of your life was that's what we're going back to so I can tell you that this what we the message of the hour that we follow is a beautiful life thank you Lord is what it is you understand and so you can see how God through predestination has brought them up to where they are and they're going to live in those young bodies that you see not just like that but it's it's going to be a brand new body is that right a body not made by Hands by sexual desire but by Spoken Word and it's going to be a wonderful you and and you know brother brandom in the fifth seal right when he or Sixth Seal when he seen those two clouds going there he said I was always scared of those things of spirits of cloud he said he you think about and you look at what brother he enjoyed his human body that he had even though he lived in a body that was sick and failing and getting old he enjoyed the human life that God had give him and he said I want to be able to touch brother oron Neville to talk to brother oron Neville and so see brother brandom enjoyed this human life that God gave him but many message Believers we can't even enjoy the human life that God has given us we sit around going oh pitiful me poor pitiful me quit doing that start thanking God for this beautiful human life that he has given us and enjoy what he's that's what God wants he wants a people that's full of joy is what he wants right okay let's go if you would to Matthew 24 And1 sorry to leave you standing but you'll be glad I left you standing cuz I'm going to leave you sitting for a while so let's go to Matthew 241 we're all familiar with this scripture we read this a lot and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and the disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple now what the disciples were going to they would to show him these beautiful beautiful man-made temples and Jesus wasn't impressed one bit not one bit did it impressed Jesus look how he did and he said to show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said to them see you not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down you know what he did next he just walked away he just told them that they were all impressed they said oh oh let's show Jesus these bu these are the oh our fathers beat these building 46 years and took them build the temple let's show them this great thing that we that's right here he showed it to him he said there's not going to be one left one stone standing on this he didn't say a word didn't interpret he just walked right off and they were looking at they were behind him going you know walking to him went up to the Mount of Olives is that what they did they get the Mount of Olives they had some questions can you imagine yeah they had some questions didn't they sure did and he sat upon the Mount of Oles the disciples came to him privately right privately saying tell us this is the first one when shall these things be when shall the Rocks be tore down is that right the second question what shall be the sign of thy coming exactly now I want you to really look at that it doesn't say signs plural right it says sign singular does everybody understand that he said that's what they asked what shall be the sign right of thy coming and of the end of the world so there's three questions they asking when's the when is the temple going to be tore down what is the sign of thy coming is that and what is the end of the world is that the three questions they asking let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading your word Lord we pray that you'll Quicken it to us and reveal yourself Reveal Your word to us in this hour Lord in Jesus Christ's name we ask it and we just thank you Lord for the blessings of being a Christian oh Father and there truly is joy in our heart Lord just to be gathered together in your presence it's just the sh kind is here Lord and we thank you for that Lord be with us now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen you may be seated so I think I kind of got you to understand that one huh right well let's go back to Genesis if you would let's go to the beginning I always like to take it from Genesis I try to take a scripture out of the middle of the Bible then I try to take the scripture back in the new Testament okay uh yeah you can don't don't start looking at these things until I start reading and explaining them okay I don't want you get ahead of me like I say I want to I want to talk about it with you I don't want you to read it and take away from what I'm saying now okay so that's troubled hand out sometimes you hand stuff out in church people drop their head and they're they're reading that rather than listening to us huh brother Samuel so I'm just warning you I'll lose you if you if you do that so just I'll tell you when to look at what and we'll just follow it together okay amen okay so let's go to Genesis 114 if you would [Music] please and God said let there be lights in the firmament of Heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs right and for seasons and for days and years okay let's go to Psalms 19 And1 now [Music] Psalms 19 And1 everybody there Psalms 19:1 the heavens declare the glory of God that word declare means relate right you understand it declares it it's relating something to you the heavens right so it says the heavens declare the glory of God God and the firmament showeth and that word showeth means make known is that right so the firmament makes known his handiwork what is his handiwork what he's doing is that right if you're working at something that's what you're doing right so the heavens will absolutely are going to show you what the handiwork of God is what God is doing is that right Psalms 19 and uh six let's skip down to there his going forth is from the end of heaven and his circuit does anybody know what a circuit is electric it's yeah it's a circle isn't it right It Go starts here and it goes all the way around back to here is that right brother Dick's saying right so you understand electric right so that's not much but you know that you know that right so it say yeah he's going fors the end of heav and his circuit and I said Coming Round you understand coming aroundto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof what is the heat thereof the so n right is that right so in the heaven God his circuit his coming it goes through the heaven and it's nothing's hid from the sun does everybody understand that from the heat is what it's saying I know this is an odd way like I say just hang with me a minute cuz we're going to get going here in a minute okay but I want to lay some Foundation cuz this may have been a little different way than what you've heard things and we're just going to go I'm going to slow down and read it okay am now I want to read in future home a quote that brother Bram said brother Bram said this God's first Bible was in the skies is that right the Zodiac right it starts off and runs every age okay so the circuit how God moves his handiwork is put in the heavens does everybody understand that now you got to understand the Earth was taken out of its axis during the days of Noah and the Earth is in a wobble now so what used to be where you could look at the heavens and get absolutely if you were a magi the Magi seen a stranger in the sky is that what brother brandom said those Magi were absolutely over in Babylon right India if you want the truth if you want you follow what brother random said and there were three stars in the heaven brother didn't say one it was three there were three stars and that was Magi followed each one those stars is that right and those three stars came together and what did it do those three stars coming together LED them to the son of man is everybody okay with that so now they're asking in Matthew 24 what is the sign of thy coming well who are they talking to the son of man they wanted to know when is the sign of your coming the son of the son of man now I'm going to tell you and we say it you know we know that Jesus was the seventh seal standing there is that right so he talked to the first six but I'm going to tell you he told him what the sign of his coming was now no man knoweth the day or the hour of his coming but he told him what the sign of the coming would be is that right and that's what the second part of it is they said what is your sign what is the sign of thy coming and I'm going to declare to you and I'll read it here in a minute he did give them a sign to absolutely prove to them when the son of man was coming right can I tell you that he absolutely said it and he said it in Matthew 24 right right and uh I'm going to explain some things we go along I know we're going to build okay on this until we get done so anyway you understand the first Bible was the stars do you know if you study it out those three stars that happened they've happened in other times in history did you know that do you know those three stars in the line happened at the birth of Jesus J Christ does everybody understand that do you understand they also happened at the birth of your Prophet you know they also happened at the birth of Moses sure did anybody know that go look through history every time now I'm going to tell you something what happens is the natural men out here remember when Jesus went to Legion he said don't you know you come to me before my time is that right he constantly the Devils would recognize who he was and his own disciples didn't even know who he was that right so what happens is this that what you'll find is and and I'm going to use this brother Jack Moore they were down there they felt the pool of the hour they said God PR fast and pray God sent a prophet fast and pray God sent a prophet he's standing right there and they didn't even know it that's right didn't even know it is that right didn't even know he was there so the Devils will recognize before we do what's going on is that right but what they recognize I don't know how they say it and I'll explain it here in a minute you'll catch what I'm saying okay so we understand the sign of his coming okay that's I just want to stay there for a minute so it it the this constellation of stars happened and when it did there was Moses that came to Earth and Moses said there will be a prophet liken unto me which was Jesus Christ then we had William brandom down here do you know and I'm going to say this do you know what they call that when those Stars lined up you know what they say is coming to the Earth an avatar everybody understand that movie that's come out have you ever and I didn't I don't go to movies and I don't BR a movie into my house that's what he said so I listen to what he said is that right I ain't got time for those things but if you look up Avatar it's an incarnation of deity did you know brother Brandon said that Moses was Christ to that generation so what he was do you understand it's incarnation of deity so God announces it in the heavens before it ever comes to the Earth is that right brother R said if God's going to do something on the earth he announces it in the heavens first is that right and it's true what your Prophet said was absolutely right so when you see this thing out here these blue guys yeah that's not what an avatar is what it's to do they're getting in the spirit of the age but they don't have the realization or the revelation of what a real true Avatar is what an avatar is is the incarn of God Amen did you know that sure amen and you can and I want to say some things that'll kind of blow you away I'm not an astrologist I'm not an astronomer but and I'm going to give my disclaimer here okay brother B said he didn't understand the Stars right did you know he said that exactly your Prophet said I don't understand the Stars see the stars are not our Bible right the pyramid is not our Bible now brother said the stars were a Bible right it was a Bible he said the pyramid was a Bible but brother said our Bible is this right here right there's your Bible so whatever it is that I think I if I look the stars and come up with something I better get it in here right Faith's final resting place is in the word of God is that what he told us so I don't care if it's a message preacher I don't care what you are out there you come up with some idea some saying some teaching some Doctrine you better be able to put it in this black book amen and if you can't put it in a black book then sit down shut up that pretty rough is it that's right cuz I don't I you don't need to you know your saying is as good as my saying as your saying is his saying right but we're not into sayings we're into thus sayth the Lord we're the Bride of Jesus Christ what I've got I don't have brother said you watch in 1963 after the seals broke brother B said you ain't got no thought coming right in other words your opinion ain't worth nothing just get rid of it your opinion is no good what we have is thus sayith the Lord or we keep still amen that's what he said right so this is my Bible right here right but there is in the scripture that I read to you there is a sign of the coming of the son of man right am it's a sign it doesn't say signs it says sign I hope everybody understands that it's a sign do everybody got that okay I was reading a book here a while back and and I think didn't didn't I hear somebody say that you guys listen to the communion table recently yeah play it here okay what year was it which one was it 65 65 okay okay well the one I'm going to read to you is in ' 62 I was hoping it' be the same one but we were having the same thing at our church we were having a communion service and uh so I read the communion book I do the same thing you know when I when I preach something I read a book I read the Bible I get it all together right right so I was reading a communion book and I really hit some quotes that I thought well what is the significance of that you know what I mean and uh of course I'm an old it guy an old senior it analyst so I do know how to use a computer I mean I try to stay away from them I'm going to be honest with you most things on the internet will mess you up right it's still part of the science it's still part of the fourth dimension everybody understand that so you got to be aware of it right I mean I I honestly I believe television could be used for good right but the average person you'll mess it up that's right I'm sorry I'm going to just be honest with you that's right uh and I don't know why I get on this but anyway said he blowed out the shotgun yeah and you know quite honestly that's what I would do too matter of fact call me I'm pretty good shop the shop if you need help there I will help you okay but right okay I me read that quote again I didn't finish in future home if I will God do we have any kleenexes somewhere give me a glasses I don't need a GL I need a Kleenex man I don't need to clean them I need I've got allergy problems no that's not what I need now thank you yeah I've got allergy problems so my eyes are water it's hard to read but you get my age I think I'm in the trial now you know I was in single Vision I went to buy now I think I'm headed to try so so future home God's first Bible is in the skies the Zodiac it starts off and runs every Age The First beginning of zodiac is the virgin that's how he come first the last figure is Leo the LI the second coming just before they it and just before there is the cross fishes which is the cancer age now I'm going to I'm going to ask you something was the cross fishes the sign for the cancer age no no it's not you got to understand brother BR said it eight times in quotes and he always used the wrong sign for cancer did everybody understand that what I'm going to say and I'm not and you can argue with me if you will but that quote always puzzled me and I spent a week trying to figure out what in the world was he saying yeah okay let me go back to what it was every 2,160 years the planets move into a different house in the Zodiac did you know that and they stayed there for 2,160 years plus or minus 400 years okay so what it does is in the the days of Adam they were in those planets were positioned in Gemini does anybody know the signs of Gemini twins now think of that real strong through the scripture right what was the first it was twins right you go into Jacob and Esau right so underneath though when those planets were in that sign the strong thing that was going on was twins is that right you go in the Book of Genesis what Adam's children was called Satan's Children was called the same thing right he tried to it was twins all the way down through that 2,000 years is that right then you come up to the next years is that right does everybody understand what I'm saying and so what it is those PLS move into a different house they call it and they reside there for 2,160 years does everybody understand amen and so what the it has a great impact it's a sign of what's going on on Earth does everybody understand that's what I'm trying to God first announces it in the heavens then it comes to Earth everybody's okay with that that's what brother R said and I can read more quotes if you want me to prove that okay so these things roll down then we had in the days of Moses when he come see in those 2,000 years God sends an avatar to that house does everybody understand what I'm saying so an avatar is for that 2,000 years that's the one right that is the Incarnation of deity he's the one that brings what you need to know for that 2,1 is that something 60 years it was Adam is that right was he an incarnation of God yeah he was then we had Moses was he an incarnation of God yes what was it sacrificial what was he Aries right he was under Aries what a ram exactly sacrifice so for those 2,000 years of Moses those people when they come to you say well Moses is our father see they didn't want to move away from that age it was the dawning of a new age and those Jews didn't want to come out of that age do you understand right now Jesus was and I'm going to say it I know this I might sound like a mad scientist to you but I'm going to say it okay Jesus was the Avatar to the Pisces age you know what Pisces are it's two fishes swim in the opposite direction boy you were swimming the opposite direction as he was weren't you you were too weren't you I was too so that was for 2,000 years that's what was going on you were swimming in the opposite direction to him everybody opposit you understand and Jesus when he come what was this whole Ministry about I'll make you Fishers of Men it was water look at it it's oil Jesus look at his ministry he talked about it is that right I will make you Fishers of Men come follow me and I'll make you Fishers of Men well what what wasn't is already announced in the heaven right you understand it's announced in heaven and so Jesus is fulfilling that on Earth you understand well I'm going to tell you something in the book communion and let me read it cuz I I want to get here so we can understand it in the book communion listen to how brother Brandon puts this okay when I started studying out I thought wow that's unbelievable you know and I believe brother Brandon was just on Earth fulfilling it he didn't even know about the star all he could do is fulfill what the announcement was does everybody understand that brother BR said I don't understand the Stars that's what he said I can show you a quote but all he did was fulfilling what it was the announcement was in heaven right does everybody get what I'm saying right communion was preached in 1962 0204 we see that the astronomers are predicting sometime in this early part or the first part of the month and then he preached it remember I want you to write this down 62204 write it down 62204 okay we see the astronomers are predicting sometime in this early part or first part of the month beginning on the 2 or the 5th this was on the fourth he was actually preaching or somewhere along this month the Indian astronomers predict the world to blow to pieces now that's what the Indian astronomer said right now listen to what brother R says and the American newspapers make fun of it well sure what is the American Spirit ha ha H I'm going to tell you something I preached it in our church if you're all the time foolish you got the American Spirit you don't have the Holy Spirit there's something I don't want around me as a man that's full of foolishness you understand my kids when they were when I was raising them I said there's a time to joke there's a time to cry but you got to have a balance in it I believe you ought to joke okay you know the angel of the Lord told Brother brand you better quit that foolishness yeah is that what he did remember brother brand and you had talk to people who were around brother Bram they said boy he was a cutout but that he the Lord finally come to him and said you know what that's the American Spirit that ain't the Holy Spirit he said you better stop doing that and brother Brenham started quit being so foolish you understand we're in an hour we need to quit being so foolish that's the point okay listen to what he said and American newspapers make fun of it I do not believe the world's going to blow to bits to pieace but I do say it's wrong to make fun of it you understand what he's saying I do believe the world's going to blow to bits but I do say it's wrong to make fun of it I I I read it wrong let me read it again I got off I can't see my eyes are water I do not believe the world's going to blow to bits right but I do say it's wrong to make fun of it because something's fixing to happen one of these days something similar to that right when the five planets Mars Jupiter Venus and so forth come to there they never have did it those five planets that lined up they had never done it that's what oh they claim maybe 25,000 years ago and that's true if you got 12 signs of the zodiac and you stay in that house for 2,160 years then those 25,000 years ago that would have happened before but what happened what he's saying that the scientist to say is going never happened before as long as Humanity's been here did you know that right now let me tell you something do you know the day this happened when those five planets lined up do you know when it happened the day he preached communion this was that day right and he's telling you here do not make fun of that the Americans are making fun of it the Indians the Magi are saying the Earth's going to be blown to pieces I don't believe that does does everybody understand but he's saying don't make fun of it because why brother brandham knew the scriptures that God first announces something in the heavens before it happens on Earth is everybody okay with that now I'm going to read the next paragraph I predict now brother brenham's saying what he's saying okay listen to what he says I predict that this has a spiritual application right now I'm not saying that your Prophet said that amen I and this will to be posted on your internet by the way I gave these notes to them I'm going to be able to read everything I'm going to read a lot so you can catch what I'm saying okay I predict that this has a spiritual application I believe it's coming listen to what he says brother Brandon believes these five planets lining up what he believes it is this is what your Prophet says this is what I believe it is right right okay it's the coming in of the issue of God yeah coming in of the issue of God that the great revelation of the word will be open during this time is everybody hearing what he says remember they claim it was three stars came to the orbit when Jesus was born and this is five right five is Grace the number of Grace does everybody understand right right man three is the number of perfection five is the number of Grace j s u s g r a c e f a i t h so forth number of Grace God ever sends his power to the church it'll be his grace amen amen It Won't Be The Obedience of the people exactly right amen hey like that right you may have been raised in this church a message believer right you may I mean you may have never had a beard to your any alcohol to your mouth you may have never sucked on a cigarette I don't care that's not what's going to sa you your obedience don't do one thing to get you saved cuz if you could be a perfect I mean raised right here on the church pier and be perfect be saved there would be no reason for Jesus to have died right amen right there would have been no reason see it's not by works least any man should boast he says it's not your obedience that's going to get you there it's not obedience that's going to make this thing work it's the grace of God now I don't I don't believe in sloppy Grace I believe if you got the baptism Holy Ghost you're going to bring forth fruit amen is that right fruit is what you're going to bring forth in your life is that right so if you don't bring forth fruit you ain't got the Holy Ghost cuz if a tree don't bear forth fruit cut him down throw him into tribulation the fire is that right and that's what will happen if you don't have Fruit by the way amen and Isaiah said in the 40th chapter how to cry to Jerusalem that her Warfare was over yet she was guilty of idolatry but it was God Grace that was sending it God sends anything to us it'll be his grace and not our merits right so if it may mean something I predict that there will be a change he say issues of God coming forth okay there's a significance in this and when I when I show it to you it'll it'll knock your socks off you understand but it's really something I don't know what it'll be but it's fixed but believe it's fixing to happen we're on the right on the eve of it now and and if any man hungers let him come to Christ If any man is thirsty right let him come to Christ he quenches The Thirst right he is the satisfier of all of our thirst and hunger when the son of man was made flesh at the Feast of Tabernacles which was the seventh Feast he said If any man thirst let him come unto me exactly understand so what this is showing and I'm going to give it away a little bit this is the coming of the son of man I believe you're Prophet said I'm going to say I believe it's the issues of God coming forth okay now let's go read some things that these astronomers say okay let me let me read something see this newspaper article here I want to read this this is what got me going on this okay this right here we're going to read a little bit like I say you will understand when we go along through and I got to start here okay I don't know if this is in your paper this was in May the 17th 2011 J oh I'm sorry January I said oh I'm not seeing good countless people reacted on social networks Friday the news that the stars have shifted alignment astrologically speaking no matter that the astronomy instructor who started all in a weekend newspaper interview said it was an old story very old 2,000 years old actually and that astrologists were insisting it would change it wouldn't change a thing the the story had traveled around the blogosphere like well a shooting star some people seemed angry I believe it's a zodiac scam said Jose Ary or Arch or whatever a 38 year from year old from Fort Lee New Jersey who runs a body shop I've known myself to be a sag Arius I believe since I was born so to come up now with some new sign it's unacceptable is what he said right but others weren't so ready to curse the Stars Kathy torpy always felt like she was a Scorpio trapped in a Sagittarian body I know what that is I found out I was not the son of Peggy and Ed weissinger but I was a Son of God and I've been trapped in this body every one of you sitting in this room have been born under a sign you know that every one of you have been born on under a sign I'm Taurus the Bull hard-headed amen right where are you Aries what are you Aquarius you're Aquarius okay good so we're all born under a sign is that right you know brother Brandon people come and talk to him and they have a certain characteristic about their body right he said it's the sign you were born under is that right but I'm going to declare to you that I found out I was not the son of wi singer I might my natural birth might have been under the sign of Taurus but I have been reborn Born Again under the sign of the son of man so the only influence I have in my life is the son of man so the Taurus thing the Gemini thing forget it does everybody understand that you can go read the horoscope all you want and it's going to tell you this is a bad day for you when the son of man said this is a good day for me this is a that the Lord has made and I will be happy and glad in it so I am not born under a Taurus because I never was the son of Peggy and Ed wi singer I finally recognize I am the son of the son of man is what I am that's the sign I'm born under the sign of the son of man so if you have any influence if you're a bride member here today your influence is from the son of man that's the sign that you're born under amen so forget that stuff you understand right I just wanted to say science is coming along you understand what I'm saying it really is okay right where' I stop somebody help me here sagarian body trapped yeah okay emotional and creative she said more than competitive and intellectual like Sagittarius so on Friday even though she pays little heed to horoscopes torpe said she was thrilled to discover that she have may have always been a Scorpio after all well see this listen it it's kind of I'm thrilled that I always was yeah right a Son of God I was born under the sign of the son of man am and when I found it out I was thrilled you know I thought all those years I was born under the sign of Taurus but you know what I'm not born under the sign of Taurus I'm born under the sign of the son of man so forget that stuff you understand what I'm saying so they're coming in a natural types of spiritual does understand that they're coming to the conclusion they weren't born under the sign that they thought they were born under because of the wobble of the earth that throws everything off you understand so science says you're this the devil says you're this you're that you're that I'm not what he says I am I am what the son of man says I am that's what I have come to you understand what I'm saying so get away from what the devil says start start being what God said you were okay that's right astrolog could have reported a wave of calls emails or website hits from concerned clients people are more attached and loyal by their signs than they thought said Eric Francis editor of Planet Waves net who said he had 25,000 hits on his site since midnight it's interesting how many people are panicking their sign is wrong wow that's right astounded by all the Kur fuffle was the man who started it astronomer and instructor Park kungle in an interview Sunday in the Star Tribune of Minneapolis kungl explained that the Earth's wobbly orbit means it no longer align to the stars in the same way it was when the signs of the zodiac were first conceived about 5,000 years ago that means kungle said that when astrologers say the sun is in Pisces it's really an aquarius right can I give you a little hint now yeah what happened on February the 4th 1962 we entered the age of Aquarius we left the age of Pisces does everybody understand yeah and I'm going to show you something Buddy you caught it you're there see they get it before you remember the Devils recognize it before you got it you're right now you're hitting it now you see what I'm saying there is something that happened in Heavens on that day that was going to Absol it's declaring in Heavens and it's going to happen on Earth does everybody understand that so what it was we went out of that Pisces age where it's two fishes swimming in the opposite direction and we entered into the Aquarius age does everybody understand that the Aquarius age do everybody understand what the aquarious is the 11th sign right do you know the numerology of the Bible what 11 is revelation there were 11 of the disciples that had the Revelation there's one that didn't right so 11 is a type of Revelation so brother sitting there on the very day it's happening and he says I believe I believe it's the issues of God coming forth amen now that's what your Prophet said he said don't make fun of it now brother random didn't go by the Stars brother random went by thus the scripture do you understand because whatever happened in the heavens will happen on Earth and it was happening in your Prophet on Earth that's the point I want to bring but now we're down here I can prove if you say science is this is a good science I'm going to prove to you what was happening on that day was exactly what your Prophet said was happening the issues of God was coming forth and I can prove it by the scripture okay so we're there right we're getting there amen it's really Aquarius and so on astronomers have known about this since about 1:30 BC kungel told the Associated Press Friday in his office at the Minneapolis Community and Technical College his phone ringing constantly as it had since article come out one person that even remark give me back give me my sign back see this is not new news almost every astronomer class talks about it see we've talked about the coming of the son of man for the last 2,000 years true there's not a preacher every Baptist is going to preach out of Matthew 24 oh yeah and talk about right talk about the coming of the son of man sure they are it's been taught right this is not new news almost every astronomy class the new news are old most people had never heard it before and one of the more fascinating elements of the story was talk of a new sign allog together right now that I like there is a new sign It's The Sign of the son of man see the new sign for you and me is the son of man don't you let this zodiac stuff get you can I tell you that don't let it get you but what I can assure you what I did was when I looked at that in communion you know I said what was going on on the day that brother Brandon preached that I put in that day and it popped up I like to fell over I couldn't believe it so what it was it was the dawning and and I'm going to get to that you almost pulled it quit it quit it okay that's what I'm going to end with okay but in 1962 it was the dawning of a new age right if it's a new age you got to have an avatar for that age does everybody understand that you got to have an avatar for that 2001 and it was William brandom God was tabernacling again brother brandom was the avatar for the new age the Aquarius Age and what is it brother brandom what he's trying and I'm going to tell you let me read some I got you got them there I'm going to read it now and it'll really it'll Enlighten you a bunch okay let's turn to this I'm going to turn to the first one it says it's got a quarius underline there okay so now you understand it was the dawning of the of Aquarius the 11th sign do you know what they call it what that you got this that is the sign of the Aquarian age does everybody know that do you know what they call this guy right but look at what they call him they call him that yes the son of man right do you know they call him that if you go out go out on the internet and look it up they call this man here the son of man the perfected man does everybody understand the age that we rolled into in 1962 your Prophet was declaring to you I believe it's the issues of God coming forth look what that man's pouring out of The Jug right what is he pouring out right water what's a water the type of am word amen is everybody understand that amen so what happened in 1962 it was the sign of the son of man amen has everybody got it right now I want to show you what happened in the heaven so you'll see it but this the sign of man five planets lined up is that right Grace and that's never happened on the earth for 25,000 years it's never happened since Humanity has been you understand so what is it what is the New Age what is it bringing you to the son of man it's bringing you to the preferred perfected man does everybody understand that but he's pouring it down to earth it's got to happen in the heavens first before it can happen on Earth is everybody okay with that right amen so understand I'm going to read some scripture here in a minute and you'll see what I'm talking about but I want to read this this is science now but look how see all of science is not bad if it's true science it's got to back up what our Prophet said if it's if it doesn't back up what William brand said I throw it out does everybody understand I'm not Ed in it I'm not because brother Reen said remember Jack Moore's son graduated from LSU University as a scientist he said by the time he will have read every scientific book they will have all changed right science evolves is that right God don't evolve when God did something right the first time he did it right God don't change his mind about his word so if God does something you can hang your hat on it it ain't going to change is that right so if science tells you something you better check it out in the Bible you better check it out in this message of the hour cuz this won't change is that right okay so we had Ryan is he here the the pilot okay you know what this is okay so Aquarius means peace Harmony and joy remember what I said earlier right that announcement was made in heaven that we're supposed to have some Joy folks that's right if you don't have any Joy then you're not under the sign of the son of man amen does everybody understand that if you don't have Harmony if you don't have peace you're not under the sign of the son of man you're still under Taurus Gemini one of those old signs that's still what's controlling them right is that right but when you come under the sign of son of man you're going to have peace Harmony Joy see we ought to be folks we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth you ought to be a happy Bunch you ought to be happy I mean this guy's job ought to be the easiest job right you ought to be so happy and they're wanting to be here they're read up prayed up amen that man you just get up here and the anointing Falls the inspiration Falls and you just nothing's hard exactly see that's the way it's supposed to be right this is this is the age of the perfected man right what did Brother ROM preach is it the age of the perfected man come on it's the stature of a perfect man it is the age of the perfected man amen right here right see God announced it in the heaven now he's bringing it down to earth so we can catch it is that right now we didn't see what happened in heaven brother brandom didn't even see that but he said I predict it's the issues of God coming forth right righten okay so brother brandom was getting it by Revelation is what he was getting it by right okay so the lead star in Aquarius is Alter is what it's called altar is a yellowish white Alpha star in the Aquilla the eagle the stars named rise Mar word for constellation represents the wings of an eagle altar forms one corner of a huge triangle known to all Navigators yeah so if you're a flyer like that Ryan he would be here shaking his head altar is at 01 Aquarius 46° of the zodiac 301 de of celestial longitude like its name altar carries the significance of flying high amen yeah doesn't it say in Revelation to come up here you understand see we're under the sign of the son of man what are we we're supposed to be a flying eagle you know when it says wher wheresoever the carcass is there's where the Eagles be gathered together we're not pecking around on the ground you see an eagle pecking around on the ground where where's the carcass where are we we're flying Eagles you understand we're not sitting here building a roost on this thing exactly I'm not trying to get my I'm not trying to build a a nest and keep my children in it I'm not Building a Church I'm trying to build somebody to get out of here not to get all comfortable in the nest and set there their mouth open every time you come in I want you out of that Nest you understand what I'm saying I've been preaching at the church yesterday lately a lot of people don't understand what reformation and restoration is Luther when he came out of the Roman C he came out of the Roman Catholic Church is everybody okay at that so he preached a message he was a he was a reformer what did he do he reformed the church what did he create another church does everybody understand that Luther come out of Catholicism and created a Lutheran church now he didn't organize till after he died but nonetheless he he was a reformer what did reformers do they create a church what did Wesley do he created a church right we're down in the restoration age we're not Building a Church you know I looked it up on the on the message on the message I'm going to challenge you with this one you may not like this the word Message Church the word message churches is never mentioned one time in the message of the hour we've come up with that after our Prophet left brother randam was not trying to build a church we're the ones that say well I'm a message Church you see what the fallacy of that is you'll get all fat and dumb and happy in your little Nest right here on Earth right here in Lula Georgia you'll say I'm a message church we I go to a message Church big deal then you're a reformer is what you are and you're going to be left right here in your little nest is that right while the rest of you fly out of here I'm not building the church I tell bville Tabernacle don't you never tell anybody they got to come to this church you get them to Jesus Christ brother said I'm afraid you're not getting them to Jesus Christ you get them to a church you're getting them to a perch where right here on the earth I'm not trying to put a bunch of earthbounds on this thing I'm trying to get Flying Eagles I'm trying to get people up into the air that's what the sign of the son of man is it's an eagle it's getting up in the air come on that's right you Earthbound holding on to all this Earthly stuff and you call yourself an eagle get that get rid of that junky stuff if the world or the things of the world's in you the love of God ain't even in you you're an eagle you're supposed to fly higher you're not supposed to reform a church right exactly you get in love with Jesus Christ and you'll get out of here thank you Lord I'm not building a church I'll be honest with you it's a truth we we don't understand the difference between reformation and restoration exactly you know an eagle we're under the eagle anointing does everybody agree with that am that's the son of man anointing is what it is that's Eagle anointing what is an eagle that's God's prophets Jehovah Eagle it's always Eagle is a prophet you're under the anointing of the eagle what does the eagle do it turned you back to the word every Prophet that ever came to Israel what did they do they were turned Israel back to the word what is an eagle it's taking you back to the word back to the original amen exactly is that right I'm not an Earthbound creature right Church you got to be kidding me right I don't call you church anymore I call you bride is that what he said brother Bron wasn't trying to build a church show me where he said you got to come to this church exactly brother R wasn't building a church he was building Eagles little eaglets where they get up and fly is what he wanted come up hither church right right altar carries the of flying high where no one has gone before ex you know Star Trek picked up on that like I say the Devils will get that before we do remember you guys when you're backsliding watching that on TV that's what my pastor used to always say it and I liked it you know see yeah you remember that you was watching that backslid and watching that on TV well didn't they get beam me up Scotty yeah see all they're doing is programming you for the blast what is it so in the real thing when you say you're going to receive a body change most of us who watch star dra you know ain't that what you do it programs your mind right that's all TV does folks Pro it's Fourth Dimension stuff brother man said every disease is in a fourth dimension right did you know he said that go ahead put a TV in your house open up every disease to your family right now I'm telling you what he said he said the fourth dimension was TV right yeah is that what he said so you put a TV in your house you're opening your house up to every disease in that fourth dimension tough man now I'm going to go down this next paragraph here if you go down to the end this was written by George Washington Cary and inz udor Perry in 19 20 these guys really were getting something you know what I mean but listen to what they say Age of Aquarius began no well let me read it and then we'll go that I I may have missed it up there Age of Aquarius began on February 4th 1962 on that day there occurred a very interesting astronomical and astrological event the planets Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn now that's the five plan brother R was talking about right listen to what he says though along with the Sun the Earth and the moon were all found in the constellation of Aquarius in addition a solar and lunar eclipse occurred right right which was visible in some parts of the Old World The Cosmic event that transpired on that day is extremely rare such a Congregation of planets occur only once every 2,100 60 years moving from one constellation to the next each time it happens it marks the beginning of a new era or new age you know you know how people now say well we're in that that New Age movement does everybody understand that this is where it started so look there anytime God does something Satan does something right when brother Brandon was preaching the seals do you realize the Baptist Church was over across the street in Louisville having their convention you know what did he say it right so see every time God's doing something Satan's doing something right every time you see it if God's doing something Satan's doing something remember when we go up the Devil comes down right every time there's an event something's going on the devil's right there he's doing some things too right a new age for Humanity February the 4th 19 marked the end of the age of pises and the beginning of the age of Aquarius in this Aquarian age the Sunday of God when the sign of the son of man has appeared in the heavens does everybody understand that right the sign of the son of man appeared right in the heavens exactly in the stars does everybody got that right listen to what it says all things will stand revealed is that true exactly isn't that the whole purpose of the son of man remember when I preached here last time Parables he preached 3 and 1/2 years he preached the see and then right and then he preached Parables after that 40 Parables he preached in 1963 he the son of man was back to interpret The Parables for you what was the purpose of him being here right all things will stand revealed exactly that's what it was does everybody understand once again in the course of the ages will mankind have reached the same goal which the Builders of the Great Pyramid reached that's pretty good ain't it what did the P what did he build what did Enoch build Bible right right aren't you written Epistles written read of all men what's God building a Bible a Bible with flesh on it isn't that what the word is in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God 14 and the Word was made flesh see God don't want that Bible just to stay here in a black book he wants that Bible to become flesh in you you if you got faith and I've been teaching this a lot if you got a revelation which is Faith does everybody agree with that you got a testimony your testimony Bears witness of what your Revelation is exactly is that right so if you have a revelation your testimony is going to Bear what your Revelation is if your life brother said your life speaks louder than your word your testimony is speaking louder than your words because why you're a written epistle WR and read of all men you sisters there's nothing greater with your long hair amen with your clean face with your dress down where they so when you go to Walmart I've been with my wife I've walked right beside her and I'll watch people and I'll see some women will go by and they'll tell her I love your hair other women will go by and they they'll go it's just like Steven they would bite down on her if they had the chance is that right why she's a written epistle written read of all men her testimony speaks of her Revelation so if you're not doing this message hour you don't have faith you don't have a revelation right you can tell me you know I've told the church in you could absolutely tell me you believe William Brenham was a prophet that don't impress me one bit where I'm at today it does not impress me one bit right pretty rough isn't it because look it means that you are under a son of man you can have brother Brenham as your Prophet yeah the children of Israel said Moses is our Prophet did it benefit him one bit what you had to do is you had to be under his message right well what do we have in around the message of the hour they say I believe the message right they believe a son of man but they never crossed over to the son of man sure does everybody get what I'm saying so I got people in my church who say I believe the message and they smoke you got to be kidding me is that the son of man no that might be under a son of man remember brother Brandon when those people were walking around the streets and they were drunk he said I've seen some of your converts out there he said they sure were mine they weren't is right do you know your Prophet said that so see you can be a convert of William brandom and they'll go out smoke and drink and cut up and do all sorts of stuff you get a convert under the sign of the son of man you won't be doing that stuff you'll get yourself all tied up you'll have a testimony that's right is that right that's right pyramid reached in that far remote age and here and there are found a few whose eyes are beginning to be cleared whose material vision is being purified whose brain cells are beginning to vibrate to that Harmony which to the ancient ones was sweet and thrilling music and when this Aquarian age shall reach its close we too will be able to join in that great anthem of Joy sing the Praises of the most high and the God within now these people did this in 1920 they don't have the Revelation I had you understand they didn't think it was going to happen for another 2,000 years when it came to an end I'm going to tell you right right now we've had our Avatar William brandham the Incarnation of deity you understand we've had this coming of the son of man we've had the sign of the son of man is that right let's read it Humanity has been wandering many many years in the wilderness sure have 2,000 years of church ages but the promised land flowing with milk and honey is very very near and soon the so stone that the builders rejected will have become the head of the corner amen this was what these two people wrote it called God man the word made flesh now brother B said he was God and man remember he said that right see they got in the spirit of the age brother and what this was done in 1920 they're talking about something they knew was going to happen by the Zodiac does everybody understand that and God absolutely by the Zodiac let me read the scripture now to prove what I'm saying let's read it now we understand that brother brandham in Matthew 24 when he did 24 29 that was under the six seal is that what it was right I mean I know you guys know that I mean this guy taught the seals amen wow I I actually listened when I first got year several years back listened to when he preached the seals what was it 72 82 8283 wow that was phenomenal you know really was I mean I'm benefited it helped me a lot it really did let's go to okay let's go to brother brand preach us out of six seals body understand that people don't understand the seals either do you understand see the seals are to us the trumpets are to the Jews does everybody understand that so when brother Brandon was preaching the seals he's preaching it to me and you when he talked about the six seal and I just taught on it Wednesday at church last Wednesday yeah the you look at the Sixth Seal brother say it's a judgment seal he said it's a tribulation seal it's also a Redemption seal so you know what it depends on where you're at right that's it if you're a born to bed believer it's a Redemptive seal to you if you don't accept this message there it's judgment to you right brother brandom said in the seals book you said there's two subjects through the whole Bible life and death right two subjects life and death that's all there is so that Sixth Seal we can place it over the two witnesses in Israel but that Sixth Seal is to us the seals are to us so you got to understand there's something spiritually that happened under that six seal to us the Gentiles amen is everybody okay with that so people will take the Sixth Seal and they say well those two prophets will open the Sixth Seal right but the revelation of it's been opened to us does everybody understand that the literal opening of that seal will be to those two Jews brother said those two Jews with the spirit of Moses and Elijah is going to open the six seal is that right absolutely but you know what the six seal has been made known to me and you right amen by Revelation it has been made known look if the book that he came down in chapter 5 was the book of redemp what is the six seal it's the Redemptive seal so if he didn't open up six then the book wasn't open in chapter 5 when he come down is everybody okay with that is that right brother so we understand as a gentile we get Redemption the 144,000 they're going to get the same message you get and they're going to get Redemption is that right so we need to understand the Sixth Seal let's look at the six seal now remember in chapter 5 he took the book and he's coming down right is that right brother said the open book was a book of redemption that's what he said so come on let's go there chapter 2429 immediately after the tribulation of those things what did Brother random say in the six seal those things were the ikeman case go read it in your seals book if you guys got a seals book you go home and read it he said right after the ikeman case right does everybody understand that right Ian was hung in febru in May May the 31st of 1962 his case had already come to an end he just hadn't got hung yet does everybody understand so immediately after these days is that what it says exactly so see the scriptures placing all this for us people right okay immediately after these after the tribulation of these days shall the sun be darkened yeah is that what I read to you that happened on the 2nd of February of 1962 there was a total eclipse of the sun was it darkened right does everybody get what I'm saying sure here's the six seal listen to it okay shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light it had an eclipse too right it was a sun and a solar and a lunar eclipse is that what I read to you scientists will back it up right they got to back it up if it's true okay and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heaven shall be shaken right and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in the heaven colon stop right there it's a colon a complete stop yeah then shall the sign the sign it doesn't say signs it's not plural folks right it says the sign of the son of man shall be in heaven stop is everybody okay with that so in 1962 0204 the sign of the son of man appeared in heaven if you to know where it appeared it appeared on that day when brother Ram said the issues of God was coming forth in heaven the son of man appeared in heaven does everybody understand that those planets lined up and it was under it was in the age of Aquarius is everybody okay with thaten it is it was under the sign of the son of man so he has showed in the heavens cuz he said it's going to the this the sign of the show us you're coming when is your coming come on help us here what did he say the sign of the son of man in heaven stop it exactly adds up to what brother BR said in okay now let's read on listen to what it says sorry man my I got allergies so bad right now I heard somebody else did I'm sorry to hear that I know what they feel like amen and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn do you know there the Indians were mourning they thought it was going to break to pieces sure you understand what I'm saying they're talking about this they said the horse is going to be blown to Pieces yeah right and we're sitting here going H yeah the Americans Americans we're something you know and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven Hallelujah did we see that amen so in 1962 he showed in the heavens before it ever come to the Earth exactly sure does everybody understand that amen so here it is it appears in the Stars then he brings it down and there's a cloud what is a cloud water you if you got Cloud you got water is everybody okay with that look at that guy what's he pouring out water right it's the issues of God coming for so he shows in the heaven and he says stop then he goes on he said then you're going to see the Clouds Of Heaven 62204 we see it in heaven stop a little while after that we see the cloud come down is that right about a year later right and it's in the Clouds Of Heaven so he announced it Heaven first exactly and then he brings it right down to earth is that right is everybody okay with that and it's a cloud what is it water what is the whole sign of the son of man the aquarium it's water he's pouring out water upon the earth now we know and again let's go back to the six seal it's either a judgment seal or it's Redemption seal for you that's under Redemption it's pouring out water to amen for you for you that do not receive this message of the hour it is Judgment right I don't know how else to say it depends on which side of the Cross you're on you're either getting the issues of God poured out to you or you're getting the judgments one or the other that's right one or the other right remember brother R said a pardon is not a pardon accept it is accepted as a part so there's something you got to accept this thing is that right amen amen let's read some more okay I want to go to this one here the sign of the son of man by Dr Wesley a swift I put a disclaimer on this this guy he started the KKK he was a white supremacist but I remember the Devils will get it before the others will does everybody understand that I'm telling you that's what happens I mean they're sitting there going fast and pray fast and pray God's going to send a prophet standing right there and they didn't even see it understand what I'm saying right so listen let's go down I put a disclaimer there so you can read that we are facing and this is what he said we are facing one of the most significant years in all history this was this he wrote this in 13 of 62 okay 13 of 62 we are facing one of the most significant years in all history one which will which all astronomical observers have looked forward to what will transpire has never happened the lifetime of any scientist astronomer or astrologer on the face of the Earth in fact the exactness of the condition which is appearing in the heavens will take place in February of this year and has great significance regarding prophetic measure I mean this is a guy who's started to KKK you got to be kidding me but what was it he looked at it from he was a scientist too he looked at it for what it was okay so listen to what he says and that's great significant and it has been 23,000 years years when as many planets in configuration has been in opposition or in the same sign together and make the same patterns they are now making even if we were to remove the exact position to which they are now assembling the most significant thing is that the last time as many as five of these planets were in life and similar positions took place listen to this took place four years before the flood that preserved Noah and destroyed his enemies yeah what was he going to destroy no with the brightness of his coming am you understand sure when he son of man come what did he destroy him with the brightness of his coming brother B said they're dead setting in the church fuse right is that what he said see same thing happened in the days of Noah amen that's right okay the most significant thing is that the last time as many fathers in C took place oh I read that no it's again yeah four years before the flood that destroyed the enemies of Noah and I said as it was in the days of Noah under the judgments of God that was one of the last times in ancient pattern of Prophecy that five of them appeared in similar configuration yeah that's something isn't it amen now this is a significant thing because we are soon to move out of the sign in the sky under which we have been traveling for many thousands of years known as Pisces the sign of the fish crossed fishes brother random would constantly say crossed fishes cancer well cancer is the crab cancer is not the crab do you understand said I don't even understand the Stars so you see I kept reading that it confused the fart out of me I said how can it be the crossed fishes and cancer well the answer is it couldn't it was the crossed fishes it was the Pisces age is what he was talking about okay which also was the sign of the early church under which the early church carried out their early Ministry some of you here today might have that fish on the back of your bumper do you get rid of it get rid of it put the sign of the Aquarian the son of man there's the sign you're under you're not under Pisces anymore does everybody understand that you have moved into the stature of a perfect man the son of man's where you're at right exactly amen so I like it you said yeah you had it I was wondering if anybody did when they were harassed by organized jewelry as well as the power of Rome was the sign of the fish we have been in a sign of Pisces during all of the Christian era now we are coming to what is known as the sign of Aquarius in the month of February he said this 13 is 62 is everybody understand that brother ROM preach Comm now what does communion have to do with water and wine and bread right is that right so communion has to do with water you wash the people's feet right what appr how perfect could how how could you preach it any more perfect than that amen perfect right now we're coming into what is known as the sign of Aquarius in the month of f February it is in Aquarius that this great configuration to Heavens takes place the sign of his Blessing amen Aquarius is the water man pouring out the water of the heavens and that has been the symbol of the prophecy which God gave to Joel amen did your Prophet use Joel a lot amen right now in Joel he would pour out his Spirit right pour it out you see what I'm saying pour it out right but he also said there'd be a restoration that was for us too right right okay in the simpol of process God did I am going to pour out my spirit upon All My Sons and Daughters my young and their old men hey old guys you you're an old guy I'm an old guy he's going to pour out his Spirit upon you amen you ought to be some happy man amen right man you come to church you ought to be joy happy worship do you see that's what God's doing at this hour this is the age the era that we're in right right and yet you come moping around I'll tell you you're under the Judgment of the six se you're not under the Redemption of it I'm going just be honest man I get upset I tell our church you need to get happy around here exactly you need to thank God for what you know a pardon is not a pardon unless is accepted if you accept it wouldn't you show some kind of appreciation if you really you know if you don't accept it you never wanted it but if you accept it wouldn't you have to say brother Claud I sure appreciate that pocket knife you gave me wouldn't you show some appreciation me well shouldn't we show some appreciation God's giving you a pardon in this end time The Book of redemption's been open like I told the church the book is open now you're supposed to put your John saw his name in the book you ought to put your name in Isaiah 53 every scripture every promise you put your name in it cuz John seen his name in the book you put your name in the book If God promises you something in the book go back and reread it and put your name in there John the Revelator saw his name in there and he quit crying he said boy he got happy didn't Heen did John the Revelator get happy you've seen your name in the book and you can't be happy something wrong with you right amen Aquarius is a sign of the outpouring of the spirit of vision and power and a new day amen I put Feast of Tabernacle right holy convocation what was was it it was a new day coming a new era Dawning right we are now under the new sign in the heavens and I put flashing red light of Us coming see brother random preached it after that he did preach it you go look at how many times and I've got the quotes it's going to be posted on the internet I'd keep you here all afternoon talking about this I've got it brother Joseph's going to post it on the internet I show many quotes where he talks about them stars that are lining up and I might read the one in the Fe there is one in the flashing red light of his coming because what is it's a sign God put a sign there and that sign was to let you know of his coming it was the second question being fulfilled is that does everybody okay with that we have the answer to the second question we actually got the answer to the third one too right but I'm working on the second one tonight today okay so we have the answer we are now under the new sign in the heavens the events are happening are new signs as the whole universe moves like clockwork with great Precision you must remember one of the things that the pist tells us about is that God has built the earth and the universe in proper relationship Psalms 19 I read it he says that the heavens declare the glory of God firmament showeth his handiwork and day into day and night into night showeth knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard the line of their message is gone out to all the earth and the word to the end of the world and in them hath he set a tabernacle for the Sun right right do you know they say that the pouring out is his divine feminine yeah that's what they talk about when they talk about that perfected man when it's pouring out it's his divine feminine right she is him right is that what your Prophet started saying after the seals did he start saying she is him is that what he said right sure he did this is a zodial track of the earth and it runs in its orbit and we are told that the sun is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race and he goeth Forth One into the heavens and a circuit to the end of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof so the law of the most high is talking about signs that will be put in Heavens which they were to read and he told men who lived thousands of years before Christ what the signs would be not of his coming only which the wise men told at his birth you know they studied under Daniel did you know those Magi that Daniel was the chief Magi you know I could and I got the quote that he's going to post Daniel was the chief Magi sure he was he was the one that said a star would rise up out of Jacob no it was bam that said that bam said a star would rise up out of Jacob right but Daniel was the chief Magi he brought the scriptures to Babylon right and he you know what they his God was God so what did they do those Babylonians started reading that scripture those mad guys knew the Stars yeah Daniel was the chief Magi is what brother Randon said so when they seen those Stars they seen one star and they followed it until those three stars lined up and it led them to the E son of man is that right am right and this is of course the one thing we look forward to and the one thing which we recognize and understand because the kingdoms of this world are to become the kingdoms of Our Lord you know what the son of man is the kingdom of God Amen exactly I preached that sermon too amen you know brother Brandon preached Matthew 6 in the in U souls are in prison now do you know what souls in prison now was if you want to understand the third pool go read that book is that okay right what was the third pool of Jesus when he descended down is that right what happened he has descended down was the third pool in this hour a lot of people are looking for the third pool they don't even know is that right I had a guy sat at a Wendy's restaurant with me one time and he said you know what when the third pool starts watering I going to speak of burger into existence I was sitting there looking at that brother I didn't say a word but in my heart I said you're yet carnal that's the scripture that came to my mind you are yet carnal brother BR said the third pull was the opening of the word see these guys they get a hold of the third pole they're W to do carnal things they want to speak you and me both out of existence tell what they want you that right no they can't open the word they can't explain the word get in a cooler room and explain it and break it down to a congregation to see what the third pool really is what is it spoken word it's the opening of the word right amen right right Amen brother brand would say there said Well when the pressure comes down it's going to really work then you know there's a quote brother said the pressure's now right what they do with that quote did they just skip over it sure no the pressure's now folks EXA this is where the third pool ought to be happening right here in this congregation you ought to be healed set your seats but if you come forward we're going to do Mark 16 cuz I still believe it's part of the Bible I had a guy tell me that you know he said we're beyond that I kept saying beyond what tell me what that is please tell me what that is well we're beyond that and finally I got it out of well you know when you had that guy come up or that guy come up and you laid hands on him I said really he said we ought to have more faith you know I I told him I said you know what faith is a gift too so if you're going to do away with the the you know right you know the gifts of healing right gifts plural of healing then you got to do away with faith cuz what he's saying is let's do away with the gifts right how can I do away with with with the gifts of healing which is the earnest of the Resurrection I'm going to give up my Earnest right exactly I'm going to give up my Earnest to the resurrect if I give up my Earnest am I going to get the new car no cuz your earnest is your down payment on the new car so I'm going to give up the down payment what makes me think I'm going to get the new car so I thought man you need to go read the scripture man because if I give up that then I give up Faith right and he says we need to have more faith well all of that works you understand all the gift if you don't have all gifts working in your church brother said you're living in a delusion that's what he said I didn't say that so if we take any of the gifts out then we're living in a delusion but they'll be put in the right place you won't go speak it in tongues and interpret it and it won't happen right right if they do that at my church I'll get up and say we got a line spirit in the church right if it don't come to pass just like they said I'll as a as a pastor I'll get up here say we got a lion Spirit at bville Tabernacle and we're going to pray that devil out of here right see that's why a lot of people message churches don't play with ITA right exactly you got the gift it'll work right that's right exactly right but you know what by the preaching of the Gospel we're casting out Devils amen sure amen that's right you understand you know this man right here every time he gets In a Pulpit and he preaches to you people here do you know he's casting out Devils do you know he pays that price in his flesh right here if there's a man you need to be praying for you better be praying for this man every day because those Devils as soon as he casts them out they're trying to find a house to get into do you think this guy's exempt from that devil it wears on my body too he'll follow me home and work my head does he work your head these people think they're the only ones who get crazy thoughts in their head you got to be when that Devil's cast out of you where do you think he's going to go to the preacher he's going to try to get the strong man if he can get the strong man he'll get the house man don't tell me I've been preaching for 4 years when I get through pre you know brother said your wife ought to let you sleep in on Monday right you know he said that right yeah but he don't does he I don't either I get up early too but that's what he said does everybody understand so you pray for this I'm telling you I've been pastoring now for I understand you before that I didn't understand one thing I thought why me Lord yeah but now I understand we pay that in our bodies is what we pay this man forfeits himself for everyone in this congregation that's right if you don't pray and you don't love this man you need to something wrong with your experience you need to get behind him you understand what I'm saying lift him up in prayer That's Right Where I Leave off I I that was I didn't mean to get on that but anyway point to the words Jesus okay I would point to the words of Jesus who made the statement in Matthew 24:30 that there is going to appear the sign in the son of man in Heavens and it did yep yeah right I can say this day this scripture is fulfilled if you do not believe that that didn't appear then you do not believe the six seals I come on let's just be hon that's brother B said that was the scriptures he used for the six seal didn't he sure it was so that is the sick seal it's the Redemptive seal what did it he Christ come down amen it was the sign of the son of it appeared in the heavens it appeared on Sunset mountain is that right in a cloud showing you that God is bringing his issues forth is what he's doing he's revealing his word to you the congreg right here God is here to will and do what his word says and what God wants to do your heart says I want to see you and he wants to reveal himself to you amen you understand the Deep calleth to the Deep amen is always man has wanted to see God right and you can Glory brother brand said we have come to face to face is what he said in the church complete realization right we have a revelation is that right we have come complete realization of him is what we have and it's end time amen is that right that's right thank you I'm not to go any further so I'm I'm only read so long I'm not a reader if I was a reader I'd be a Jehovah Witness that's what I told him in the church I start reading a quote and I forget it and start flying and preaching you know what I mean because I told him I said I'm not a Jehovah Witness I'm not a reader right I can't help it no I'm not against the guy who reads quotes it doesn't bother me if you got to prove your point by reading the quote please do is that right we want to read the quotes right sure right let me ask you something 662 the destruction that's been in the earth what has it been yeah sure water right water tsunamis yeah everywhere in America now everywhere it floods where I'm at it floods up north I mean I I think I looked at Fox News where the snow melt up north melting because they've had much now they're worried it's going to flood everywhere flood earthquakes tsunamis but it's water every everything going on is water water what is this God's trying to tell you something God will put it in the heavens God puts it on Earth God will put it right in front of you God wants you to get this thing do you understand what I'm saying that's right see God is Not slacking some down slackness but he's longsuffering toward us word amen because we're humans humans we're dumb yep I mean I don't know how El to say it you know I read an article time science says you got to hear something 14 times before you comprehend it the average human did you know that 14 times before you comprehend it I got out of pullit I stepped down I said I know some of you aren't average so I'm going to repeat it 28 times for those of you for those of you that are not average and I know some of you aren't let's not kid oursel so if I repeat myself don't gripe at me I said you're not getting it and I'm going to keep repeating it cuz I'm not in a hurry I tell them anymore I am not in a hurry I want you to get this so I am not going to get nervous and in a hurry I'm going to take if it takes 28 services for you to get it then you're going to get it so don't grab it to preacher if he's got to repeat himself it's your fault right that's right it's the truth I've heard people say that well our pastor repeat to himself I thought well I didn't say it but dummy what I wanted to tell them s fault not the preacher's fault right am amen right let me see something else I want to read some

you know the motive of a pastor he lives for the people he's a burden Bearer that's right and he loves you you know I tell our congregation back home I said you know if God put you through that back door I believe he loves you period I don't care if you come in stumbling drunk I don't care what you look like if God brings you through that back door God's got to love you to hear this message right this message is the best thing that ever struck to the Earth that's right and if you walk through that back door God has to love you and I'll love you I'll work with you I'll give you a weapon when you need a weapon yeah I'll clean you up when you've got a dirty diaper amen I'm not going to throw the baby away I'm going to throw the diaper away do everybody know there's a lot of preachers they throw the diap the baby away oh I've seen it man they'll blast you right right but I'm not going to throw them away no if God gave me favor with them and they keep coming and I keep preaching this inspired message hour and it'll hack and chop you but we're chopped out by the prophets does everybody know that that's right it'll hack man it hurts oh it hurts I mean there's nothing wor and you tell me if I'm wrong the worst message or the hardest preach in do is when I got to correct my congregation you know we always say when we're mom and daddies we say boy I don't like to whip my kid but you better exactly there's people today don't believe with their kids anymore really show me that in the Bible right show me where your Prophet said that right don't get those things in your head right amen but you know what it's the hardest thing we can do is come out here and correct them but if I love them I'll correct them right when I see spirits coming into the church I'm not going to let those Spirits stay there and take away the rest of the congregation if that person I I nail that spirit and that person leaves I still love them I still make it where they can come back it was their choice that they left right and I make it to where they can come back if I see them on the street I don't get on the other side of the street right right I actually love them as a brother and I tell them you're welcome to come back to this church I have have had people since I'm the pastor to leave the church and I always and they'll come to me and tell me I'll say you know what I appreciate the time you've been here we love you you've great you've added a great great Dimension to the church and you're welcome to come back because I don't want them to go out there and feel like they can't come back that'd be an awful thing wasn't it and that's the way I want people to leave I really do but I want the quotes and I didn't get to read a lot of them just not I already took more time than I should have but I wanted you to see that there was things happening and now we're able to understand what even to more degree what was happening during that time right and so when you look around that here and you see something going on God's trying to talk to you right see God put this whole thing together the whole earth was for you right all that's going on is for you you say really yeah it's all about you you understand what I'm saying it's the bride it's all about you is what it is amen so God's trying to get this message to you is what he's trying to do and he'll use any mechanism he can to do it right is that right right so God's good to us brother Samuel if you'll come I hope I didn't amen mess it up too bad but I hope you understand amen LIF Stand Together anybody has a need for pray and P up let's do that going eat come back okay you enjoy the [Applause] mess that's right the prophet's message started in 63 right sure absolutely I told you before brother around and told
