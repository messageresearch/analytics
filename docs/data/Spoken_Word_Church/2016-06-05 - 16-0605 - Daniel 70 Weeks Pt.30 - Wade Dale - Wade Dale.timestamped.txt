[0:00] okay we're recording now okay speaks
[0:11] truth we are wrong all right we're all
[0:16] know Lilly Zooey's will be here in a
[0:19] minute oh are you just running behind
[0:26] i'll be here man period so while staying
[0:30] with the chickens until the head
[0:31] brewster gets here okay so uh the boys
[0:38] gone too with sterling and em up to
[0:42] Indiana let me to distraction good ok
[0:48] now for those of you any I'll have this
[0:52] out I know Rebecca's got the app on your
[0:54] those of you that are there applied
[0:59] applied savvy so that's what that mean
[1:03] it's an application or play is a nap and
[1:07] it's the table and this is all the
[1:10] quotes you can pull up I'll get put in
[1:13] 70th and they give me 31 results so
[1:15] there's 31 times a brother round said
[1:17] the word 70th okay so we're just going
[1:21] to pick that one today we read some of
[1:24] them last week and go read them again
[1:25] this week because they're important and
[1:30] and as we were talking before the
[1:34] contention in the message in contention
[1:38] means one contend one way one contends
[1:40] another way the desert treat ok you can
[1:44] contend them but this is this this dip
[1:47] with this one treat my brother Dale Toma
[1:48] there's only one tree that's one true
[1:51] thank God God can't give you an untruth
[1:55] he has to give you the availability to
[1:59] get true and then you have to run it
[2:02] through your filter that's the problem
[2:05] some people run it through their natural
[2:06] filter and get a different
[2:09] interpretation than what the Prophet
[2:11] said but the contention in the message
[2:13] is since we've been through all this and
[2:15] we have the church know one thing for
[2:17] sure there's one we left have direction
[2:19] according to the Bible I say that first
[2:21] according to the Bible and the prophets
[2:24] message there's one week left after the
[2:26] rapture that 70th week will be right
[2:31] here after the rapture takes place go
[2:33] fulfill scripture all the way three
[2:35] we've proven it all the way I don't
[2:37] think we have to prove it anymore all
[2:39] right but let's go to the quotes because
[2:41] what they're saying is they say that
[2:44] brother Branham talk Daniel seventy
[2:45] weeks in 1961 one way and then when the
[2:49] seals broke he taught it another way and
[2:52] in 1961 he was basically wrong you'll
[2:55] never get most of the admitted but those
[2:57] that have left the message those that
[3:00] have left and said brother Branham was
[3:02] wrong false prophet or whatever the ones
[3:05] that have left the two things that they
[3:07] Kim well three actually number one is
[3:10] the cloud they say he wasn't out there
[3:12] they say this wouldn't happen they say
[3:14] that didn't happen number two damn 70
[3:16] weeds he made so many mistakes he was
[3:18] wrongly wrong the wrong and in 1977
[3:22] that's the three things that you'll go
[3:25] on to believe the sign or any of those
[3:27] websites that are those sites that are
[3:32] wrong thats a brother around was wrong
[3:34] and they're trying to get the people out
[3:36] of the message now yes it brother ground
[3:38] was so wrong in these areas okay well my
[3:41] my contention is is that if the people
[3:44] in the message in the message that are
[3:46] saying that they that he was right but
[3:51] yet they come along and say well done
[3:52] brother I'm changes doctrine from one
[3:58] week left after the rapture to only
[4:00] three and a half years left after record
[4:02] alright but now this quote to me
[4:09] if this globe versus what we're teaching
[4:11] versus what they say is true then
[4:14] brother Ram was the most confused man
[4:16] that ever lived that we're supposed to
[4:18] listen to I said that we're supposed to
[4:21] listen to that rat dream faith delays in
[4:23] these books and take this way man ok so
[4:28] it can't be an opinion are or we can't
[4:31] decide what the brother ground was wrong
[4:33] now bro Brad was wrong when he preached
[4:35] a white horse rider was the Holy Ghost
[4:37] he himself God corrected him during the
[4:42] seal ok but you'll never hear him say
[4:45] that God corrected him on Daniel seventy
[4:47] weeks it was always you misunderstood
[4:50] what I said and will read that later on
[4:52] but now their contention is is that he
[4:55] showed one week left now my whole
[4:58] problem with this thing is he preached
[5:01] three sermons I'm day in 70 wheels if
[5:04] one part of this is wrong it's all wrong
[5:06] right he preached it right out of the
[5:09] Bible took it right out of the history
[5:10] and I believe when he said in this book
[5:13] is the same thing he said in the sealed
[5:15] there's just a revelation there that we
[5:18] must have that shows that he was right
[5:21] continually all the way through so their
[5:23] contention is is that brother branham
[5:26] preached this what we're going to read a
[5:29] minute from Daniel seventy weeks that
[5:30] there's one we left after the rapture
[5:32] and then in the seals he changed it as
[5:34] only three and a half years left all
[5:37] right now but now I wanted I found this
[5:39] quote from 1957 questions and answers
[5:41] all right and it's the video can show
[5:44] that she's shown and also this is
[5:47] questions and answers don't look at
[5:48] Hebrews now watch it was given by Lord
[5:51] Jesus on Matthew in Matthew 24 that the
[5:53] Jews would be taken out of patron what's
[5:55] he talking about Matthew 24 they would
[5:58] be taken out we would be grafted in and
[6:00] then they would be put back in like Ryan
[6:03] Ryan was asking me a question about the
[6:07] Jews and about Israel about God God was
[6:11] married to Israel in the Old Testament
[6:13] that was his first bride
[6:16] preach that years and years here if you
[6:18] there's a series called Israel and the
[6:20] church it's in a book form almost like
[6:23] this one there's like several sermons
[6:25] that is a real good book to read to
[6:28] understand how God treated Israel he was
[6:33] married to her he had the divorce her it
[6:35] even says in the Bible I am married to
[6:38] thee alright but he put her away because
[6:41] she went for and after other gods and he
[6:44] picks up the wild olive branch on the
[6:46] Gentile bride and brings us in but he
[6:50] never will forget Israel that's why the
[6:51] damn Stephanie weeks come in so
[6:53] beautiful God doesn't forget them in the
[6:58] land you've got to keep the land
[7:00] involved remember what we were preaching
[7:02] less windy you've got to bring you the
[7:05] land God said land the land must rest
[7:08] what's this on the land that temple that
[7:13] temple that city is the holy city that's
[7:17] just the holy city cause nothing to do
[7:19] away with all right now excuse me dan
[7:23] said it back over in the old prophets he
[7:25] said would be seventy weeks of weeks yet
[7:28] allotted to the Jews no watch was what
[7:30] he said and the Messiah would come the
[7:32] press and would prophesy in the midst of
[7:34] the 70th weeks watching which was the
[7:40] seven years there's your key Jesus
[7:46] prophesied three and a half years here
[7:48] he prophesied three and a half years
[7:50] here he was cut off in the middle of
[7:54] that week he's talking about now I want
[7:57] to show you something you brother Bob
[7:59] did real quick this to me this blouse in
[8:04] it for a long time but really this
[8:06] something visual that you need to see
[8:10] and it's really wonderful i'm trying to
[8:12] get Bob to you know put it on chart
[8:18] don't worry about my be keeping stuff
[8:20] your chart and I watch look because look
[8:25] if brother branham was if he said the
[8:28] devil straight up we're going to read it
[8:29] meant that this tree and a half years
[8:30] left of the Jews in 1957 then he says
[8:33] there's one week left in 1961 then he
[8:35] changes it back to three and a half
[8:36] years in 1963 he is very confused man
[8:39] when she's not you're just not getting
[8:42] what he said watch right here I like it
[8:46] when we can do this all right right here
[8:50] one week of Jesus's ministry not the
[8:53] 70th week but brother Brown condenses
[8:56] all of Daniel 70 weeks into one week
[8:59] three and a half years of Jesus's
[9:01] ministry here three and a half years of
[9:04] Jesus's ministry here thank y'all for
[9:09] Gentile correct I want to show you that
[9:11] look a little bit a little bit closer I
[9:14] agree with this and he's done a lot he's
[9:15] added a lot of things he'd even put a
[9:17] white horse rider red or black belt and
[9:19] he's just totally correct in all this
[9:23] and I will give power to my two
[9:25] witnesses they said prophesied mallu to
[9:26] him threescore that's revelation 11 3
[9:30] 1830 and after threescore and two weeks
[9:33] shall Messiah be cut off enough himself
[9:34] he's cut off right here all right okay
[9:39] if I got that we gonna put this chart up
[9:42] but but watch how he even puts in here
[9:47] and tending the passages with baptized
[9:48] and praying the hill was open Luke 321
[9:50] he's got the water there that's kind of
[9:52] cute 26 ad and he died 38 days so he was
[9:57] 29 and a half years old in Luke 3 which
[10:01] was in October it's when he started his
[10:03] ministry making it three and a half
[10:05] years all right so everybody got that
[10:07] okay I see it on I think
[10:09] see it on there too but this is what
[10:15] they're missing in the message brother
[10:18] branham is speaking of because look
[10:20] there is nowhere in the Bible that it
[10:22] said Jesus was coughing to mr. we find
[10:28] it there's only one scripture Daniel 9
[10:32] 27 that says he shall confirm the
[10:34] covenant with many for one week and
[10:36] break the code in the middle week and
[10:38] that he is not he that he's the
[10:40] Antichrist but brother branham is
[10:43] bringing us a revelation that we're not
[10:45] understanding that the three and a half
[10:47] years of Jesus's ministry is here and
[10:52] see the contingent of the people the
[10:54] messages see they tear up everything
[10:55] brother drowned said they're saying that
[10:58] you got squeezed this over this way but
[11:02] the last half of the 70th week here and
[11:04] put the first half of the 70th week over
[11:06] there according to the Bible that can
[11:08] happen the program cannot break
[11:10] scripture listen people then then
[11:12] preachers they've been in a message for
[11:14] thirty and forty years we're drawing
[11:16] their own charts bringing out their own
[11:18] script to the brother baile never used
[11:20] they were you know why said before
[11:22] somebody asked me said have you ever
[11:23] seen a bunch of people so confused I
[11:25] said well it's kinda like you know how
[11:27] he died yesterday he was the greatest
[11:29] but I can who was it Frasier Frasier
[11:32] meet him right right they boxing away at
[11:36] all of a sudden boom somebody who I'm
[11:40] supposed to be shoes my old hits you and
[11:42] you fall down what are you gonna do
[11:43] you're gonna come up fight with you man
[11:44] and that's what happened to those
[11:46] ministers in the men's room now we put
[11:47] it on the internet because I really
[11:48] don't care they were fighting and
[11:50] grabbing at straws because they couldn't
[11:52] they couldn't tell me why this was wrong
[11:55] and everything else is right so I'm
[11:59] saying you saying this is wrong are you
[12:00] any more than the people that saying
[12:02] that brother outgrown here they leave
[12:03] the message I contend that he's right
[12:07] all the way through the man so brother
[12:10] branham is telling us about this mesial
[12:13] ministry
[12:14] now I work brother Claude unit Son of
[12:16] Man ministry because this is a ministry
[12:21] of the Son of Man right this is the
[12:23] minister the Son of Man God would be in
[12:24] human flesh and HP problems ok so now he
[12:28] has cut off in the midst of that
[12:30] ministry week not the 70th week
[12:35] according to the Bible this has to be to
[12:41] fulfill the six full purpose and we're
[12:43] going to go back to it next Sunday
[12:44] alright we're going to go through the
[12:46] six full purpose there's no way you can
[12:48] squeeze that whole six whole purpose in
[12:50] here because if you stop Daniel seventy
[12:53] weeks right here you got to put an
[12:55] everlasting righteousness and building a
[12:56] temple here and then you got the Battle
[12:58] of Armageddon that's going to destroy
[12:59] everything just one of the main you
[13:03] start grabbing at straws you know what
[13:04] they start doing start close quote for
[13:07] well now show me this is what brother
[13:11] been seen in 1957 the Messiah was cut
[13:14] off into mr. Lee what week now this week
[13:18] the Messiah week that Messiah ministry
[13:22] the Son of Man ministry was seven years
[13:24] brother round always condenses all right
[13:28] the real killer that because I want to
[13:30] try to get it goes look he's got all
[13:31] kind of things in him which is wonderful

[14:03] kingdoms and these guys ahead of gold

[14:08] right here he's proving just to get will
[14:12] follow slap on the back the time line up
[14:14] why Jesus died in a t30 and he was 33
[14:17] year ago he showed this to actually be
[14:19] pointing four weeks into go go all the
[14:21] way through and show you you here okay
[14:23] cut brother Fredo many brains in the
[14:25] quote brother Brown said now inside I
[14:27] wrote in the city Jerusalem trap on the
[14:29] Bible wat new Palm Sunday hey cool
[14:31] second 8030 maturities laughing my man
[14:40] home Hank alright so now you got 483
[14:47] years to here and one week left our
[14:50] seven year they're selling here as well
[14:52] yeah
[14:57] come right in hey mamas nobody dude I'm
[15:03] always growing spiritually and where I'm
[15:04] going we're lucky she goes okay okay
[15:11] well you just put together what we've
[15:13] been talking about John an individual
[15:16] pictures for no watch now watch what
[15:17] brother Brown says watch what he says
[15:20] here in 1957 before 61 the Messiah would
[15:27] come the press and we prophesied and
[15:30] would prophesied in the midst of the
[15:31] 70th week which was the seven years now
[15:36] if you take that literally according to
[15:38] the Bible you're going to have to put
[15:40] Jesus prophesied right there in the
[15:49] middle of the 70th week if you take it
[15:52] as exactly what we're talking about the
[15:54] lord mercy that's the bell are again no
[15:57] no right but he was cut off in a mix of
[16:00] that seven-year message because well
[16:04] three and a half years let's just let's
[16:06] just real plane three and a half years
[16:08] the Jews rejected him we accepted him
[16:12] our Redemption comes from that message
[16:16] change of the body and everything now
[16:19] then we're going in a rapture and he's
[16:22] coming back to fulfil revelations 11 3
[16:28] the last three and a half years of his
[16:31] ministry because the Jews rejected that
[16:34] one they're going to see their my side
[16:37] at the end of this one okay because
[16:41] you're going to rip we're going to read
[16:43] maybe next Sunday where the question was
[16:45] asked about the 70th week all right so
[16:48] if I got it all right we need more run
[16:52] that off come out
[16:53] where but like Bob said you gotta get a
[16:56] paper this big to really get big enough
[16:58] Claude or something you know what can we
[17:02] send it to this to print just get them
[17:03] to Princeton big big bear looking stuff
[17:06] okay okay which was the seven years so
[17:14] brother branham takes the seventy weeks
[17:16] of Daniel and compresses it to seven
[17:19] years because truly all this the 49
[17:23] years of building the Temple the four in
[17:25] 34 years coming up to Jesus what we
[17:27] talked about last night about thing and
[17:29] all this is kind of the event date but
[17:34] it's proven that God's telling them what
[17:35] to do in that's right bro but really the
[17:38] truth of the matter is the seventy weeks
[17:40] of Daniel is the redemption of Israel
[17:42] and the city we are injected in the
[17:46] middle of all that to get that first
[17:49] three and a half your message for our
[17:51] redemption so that that seven-year
[17:54] ministry which is not it's not really
[17:57] seven it's the same green i have over
[18:00] again you know it just it breached seven
[18:03] years he preached three and a half we
[18:08] got that part the Jews rejected it then
[18:11] we come up and get this part of going to
[18:12] wrap trend in the same trend have your
[18:14] message goes for the Jews but according
[18:16] to revelations 11-1 they get 1260 days
[18:21] of that message Christ comes back into
[18:24] profits and preachers to them and they
[18:27] improve to them that the Messiah has
[18:29] already come okay so that's how brother
[18:32] Graham is condensing it which was the
[18:34] seven years that part that Bob brought
[18:37] up the yellow part you see that I tried
[18:40] to explain that to mess with me but they
[18:41] sure we're brother I'm say that what's
[18:43] he saying it now so anyway you even
[18:47] people really proud he'd be cut off in
[18:51] the mix look how perfect what Jesus was
[18:53] exactly preach three and a half years
[18:55] was crucified but there is that come
[18:58] right in on this other question here
[18:59] there's three and a half years yet log
[19:02] into them to the Jews it's got to be so
[19:05] it is just three and a half years of
[19:07] Jesus's ministry left but you can't
[19:09] break the Bible the Bible says there's
[19:12] one week left after that print signs of
[19:14] Covenant and we're not here when that
[19:16] Sun if I got that so now I wrote around
[19:19] them is though saying this and then
[19:25] let's go to hear let me did last Sunday
[19:28] this is in the seventy weeks of Daniel
[19:30] Gables instruction watch revelation 6 1
[19:37] Revelation 19 21 is connected with the
[19:39] 70 weeks of weeks therefore we want stop
[19:42] and explain before we go further with my
[19:44] stop and explain why these 70 of weeks
[19:46] because if you don't you'll miss the
[19:47] seals you mr. trumpets how do we work
[19:50] place and every bit of this in here okay
[19:53] because we know one thing for sure the
[19:55] sixth seal opens literally through those
[19:57] two prophets during this ministry right
[19:59] here okay and all trumpets sound under
[20:04] the sixth seal what is the seventh
[20:07] trumpet the kingdoms of our Lord have
[20:09] become the kingdom are the kingdom of
[20:11] this world have become the kingdom of
[20:12] luring I cry that is the seventh seal
[20:14] programs to the seller sell to us as the
[20:16] same as a civic trumpet to them what's
[20:18] going to happen fall trumpet sound under
[20:20] the sixth seal which is known to
[20:21] prophets the kingdoms of this world have
[20:26] become the kingdom what what's going to
[20:27] happen once that bad well we're getting
[20:29] over the kingdom of God is coming in
[20:32] right to be established you'll miss
[20:35] those trumpets so we can place the
[20:37] trumpets right see that's another thing
[20:38] they say the feast of trouble around
[20:40] made many mistakes he did not make any
[20:41] was that you'll miss the louse plays
[20:44] three unclean spirits like problems
[20:46] three rows we know the third
[20:48] or will be the third whoa casting out of
[20:51] the red dragon right here one inside
[20:53] remember the woman she's carried away
[20:54] for how long three and a half years
[20:57] protected you'll miss it all if you
[20:59] don't because it takes place right here
[21:01] in this 70th week now he's in this
[21:05] week's right here all right because
[21:07] we're not here we don't get this message
[21:10] we've already got our message you take
[21:13] place right here according to the Bible
[21:15] in the prophets message there's one more
[21:17] week left after the retro okay now let's
[21:22] go to the 6-foot purpose I'm telling you
[21:24] this Expo purpose if you'll read it is
[21:26] the full purpose will explain to you the
[21:29] 70th week so Israel did wrong to God and
[21:33] end this 70th week what's going to
[21:35] happen I'm going to finish the
[21:37] transgression of Israel read that keep
[21:39] going this is still in the six volt
[21:45] purpose and this don't see that and this
[21:49] 70th year of Daniel heey corrects itself
[21:51] eminent we'd rather coming to make an
[21:54] end of Sam put it away what's the first
[21:56] finish trend right in this 70th week
[21:59] alright here's another one this is
[22:04] paragraph 109 right
[22:12] what is the end time the end of the
[22:14] seventh week when that prints out of
[22:16] Christ shall be revealed at this time
[22:18] making himself God all right know what
[22:20] keep going you going in the middle of
[22:25] this 70th week all right this is still
[22:30] Emma 6 full partners anything gotta save
[22:32] it in wait all right let's go back up
[22:35] there
[22:41] how will it be we say this to you by the
[22:43] word of the Lord that we which are alive
[22:44] and remain think that's lonely was your
[22:46] library manually coming Lord so now
[22:48] hinder or prevent those routes or sleep
[22:50] with a trumpet of God you found the dead
[22:52] in Christ shall rise first then we which
[22:54] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[22:55] together with them to meet the Lord in
[22:57] the air will be called away in a moment
[22:59] in 2009 during that time that ends the
[23:02] church a now what is it going where's
[23:04] the what every church a go ahead right
[23:06] that has the church a church ages or
[23:10] Gentile right Jude as a nation then down
[23:14] here on earth God starts dealing with
[23:16] the Jews they'll be two prophets the
[23:18] eleventh chapter will pick that up two
[23:20] anointed prophets like a lot of Moses
[23:22] who I think it is and they'll bring
[23:24] curses after they saying that them
[23:26] consolidated in Rome have broke its
[23:28] covenant that print and in the middle of
[23:30] this 70th week what's the middle been
[23:35] that it will break it's coming up with
[23:38] Rome a Rome will break it with Israel
[23:41] and that caused the abomination to begin
[23:43] the scatter now Armageddon remember we
[23:49] talked about that right remember the
[23:52] abomination he's going to walk in bleep
[23:54] where we're showing that he's going to
[23:56] walk in and Passover on listen of the
[23:59] three and a half years and he's going to
[24:03] desecrate the temple the Jews can't do
[24:05] any more sacrifices 144,000 streaming
[24:09] you don't need it let's get out of here
[24:11] all right go up watch sorry and there
[24:18] will be a great flood when the Gentile
[24:19] remnant sleeping burden now the sleeping
[24:21] burden is going to be what killed right
[24:23] here right the dragon realms bird water
[24:28] out of his mouth to make war with the
[24:29] realm of the woman see to keep the
[24:30] commandments and dog Rome will do that a
[24:32] confederation of church will consolidate
[24:34] them together and bring the Jews into
[24:36] this Confederation and bring them back
[24:38] to their own temple worship again into
[24:40] the said Gloria
[24:41] they'll have me own turf nice on my
[24:43] right here when they made the tree when
[24:47] they make the tree all right now watch
[24:49] but watch right here but they have not
[24:52] their temple worship yet and when they
[24:56] establish the temple worship the church
[24:58] will be gone right here so he shall make
[25:06] a covenant with many for one week and in
[25:09] the midst of that week he the Roman
[25:11] prince will what break that covenant
[25:17] that's follow your brother around can't
[25:20] say anything that the bible does like a
[25:22] man Rome will break it in the middle of
[25:26] the 70th year three and a half years
[25:29] he'll break that covenant with them and
[25:31] cause the abomination make it that's
[25:33] what to spread to the consummation then
[25:37] he will take constant Jews and persecute
[25:39] them so that's going to happen right in
[25:41] here all right because I was thinking
[25:45] the other day you don't don't take this
[25:49] is it's just something on throw out
[25:51] there the Bible says they'll process
[25:52] time for 1260 days and then after that
[25:56] after that they'll be hunted down and
[25:59] killed so right here for 1260 day
[26:02] ministry there might be a little left
[26:04] over time in here remember they'll
[26:08] promise on 1260 days and when all
[26:11] 144,000 is sealed they don't know I'm
[26:13] going to come in what the food products
[26:16] right at the end of that could do is for
[26:18] just a few days they can just start
[26:19] bringing all kind of firing because the
[26:21] Bible says whatever comes out of their
[26:23] mouth they open that 60 or they can do
[26:26] anything with nature they want to call
[26:27] the earthquakes called all these things
[26:29] going and then they're going to be
[26:30] killed comes remember who you got to
[26:33] come in in the middle that week and
[26:35] break the Covenant so it's absolutely
[26:38] 1260 days so there's a little lap over
[26:40] time in a long time still to go all
[26:43] right the what
[26:54] I like this one right here what a great
[26:56] God is what a merciful Father friends
[26:58] let me say as your pastor you don't
[27:00] realize the privileges that you're
[27:01] living under you don't realize there's
[27:03] many great men nice great Saint
[27:05] thousands of holy men that died in years
[27:07] gone by Spirit fill man who would have
[27:09] loved to sing this day that we're living
[27:12] in lets you and I take advantage of all
[27:15] right let's continue the street full
[27:18] purpose that was the same quote we had
[27:20] Roma break it in the middle of the 70th
[27:23] year three and a half years okay if I
[27:27] got that now we're going to the 70th
[27:30] week of Daniel 70th week means that
[27:39] whatever you want the next the quote
[27:43] behind that little spread what is the
[27:50] straining the middle there right under
[27:55] 70th you'll break the covenant with
[27:59] Chris Brander come that's what the Bible
[28:01] says the abomination of a successor and
[28:03] it was preying on way to conservation
[28:06] conservation of the 70th week the
[28:11] desolation I thought of my all the
[28:14] people that
[28:15] right you read that yeah it's been there
[28:19] for about six weeks desolation there's
[28:24] your desolation are there that's what I
[28:31] said you've got wrong then you've got
[28:33] Israel for three and a half years you're
[28:35] not going to hear much about Roman is
[28:37] we're well maybe a little bit about Rome
[28:38] but not much about Israel there's going
[28:40] to be a time of peace they're gonna have
[28:41] their pen worship they got they want
[28:43] they've been wanting for 2,000 years
[28:44] they got their worship but there's two
[28:46] prophets it's going to come out and say
[28:48] come out of her my people that's why
[28:50] that's in Revelation between 61 and 19
[28:53] come out of her my people and being on
[28:56] protective of her plagues what wrong
[28:59] come out of her then when he desecrates
[29:03] that temple 144 pounds going to leave
[29:05] the key problems are going to lead
[29:06] interactor and then there is your
[29:10] abomination to make it desolation he
[29:13] comes in and he's the abomination he is
[29:16] going to make that temple desolate and
[29:19] other words that you can't go in there
[29:21] you can't go in that temple and it's
[29:24] going to spread it to the consummation
[29:26] what about of Armageddon this out a
[29:28] World War not just Israel and there's a
[29:31] late Friday night Israel find the whole
[29:34] world and like I said they have the
[29:37] sense in the faith when they see the day
[29:40] I'm gonna make it you ain't gonna make
[29:42] it even remembers what's a swim did
[29:45] something said take my life today Lord
[29:47] but a bang in other words in my damn he
[29:51] killed more he killed 3000th listings in
[29:54] his death they had killed the whole time
[29:56] he was alive so they have that Sampson
[29:58] effect where they pushed the wall down
[30:01] hey its roof they're proud people they
[30:05] were smart to
[30:07] they'll call fire out of heaven and
[30:09] everything else you just wait it's a lot
[30:12] of that land ahead okay everybody got
[30:14] there so the abomination to make
[30:17] investment the Pope will walk into the
[30:19] temple and make that temple of desolate
[30:20] so yeah that's going to make somebody
[30:23] mad the Jews are sitting there they're
[30:26] saying the Messiah's coming we're going
[30:27] to make the sacrifices they got 144,000
[30:30] and to prophets over here that are
[30:32] telling them they that temple worship is
[30:34] not yet right temple worship is not it
[30:37] the Messiah already come you're trying
[30:41] to kill him again you know through the
[30:43] sacrifices you've already killed in one
[30:45] time realize that I come to the damn
[30:47] automa because the day of coma is when
[30:49] they separate cry where'd you get those
[30:52] scars and house of my friends alright
[30:55] that's the day of atonement the dama
[30:57] told me you afflict your soul not that
[31:00] you're killing Jesus again you're
[31:02] reflecting your soul realizing you're
[31:04] centering your loss okay if I got that
[31:08] so when he comes in he then all of a
[31:12] sudden for three and a half years
[31:13] they're in they're doing what they're
[31:15] doing and then all of a sudden the Pope
[31:18] waltz into that Holy of Holies because
[31:22] God's not fair people I was not in that
[31:24] whole Ebola he left that holy of
[31:27] holiness hey man that's why the
[31:30] anointing to the temple that's going to
[31:32] be built here is going to be people it's
[31:33] not going to be a cloud and smoke and
[31:36] fire on tonight sighs all right it's us
[31:40] where they're going to the temple
[31:42] because in order here's the Holy Ghost
[31:44] we know the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[31:46] will come into the temple okay if I got
[31:48] there but what what about if a man walks
[31:52] right into that holy holy one day throws
[31:54] the curtain back and there's a high
[31:56] priest with the blood he's doing what
[31:58] he's supposed to do and he turns around
[32:01] and there stands a Roman Catholic hope I
[32:05] Gentile and he walks in and says
[32:09] there'll be no more of that I'm your God
[32:15] I'm the one you've been waiting on I'm
[32:18] your guy you'll see they'll never use
[32:19] that temple again so the abomination
[32:21] makes desolate that temple will become
[32:23] desolate until they build here in the
[32:28] Millennium this is just a beautiful
[32:30] picture once you see it all come
[32:31] together but if you've got questions
[32:33] like 300 73 an avid sailor it's both
[32:39] there's three and a half years of
[32:41] Jesus's ministry level but there is one
[32:44] week left according to the Bible
[32:45] according to the prophets message and
[32:47] according to all these things that we
[32:48] think that's one we left after the
[32:50] rapture to finish the seventy weeks of
[32:53] Daniel all right right okay because you
[32:57] got you'll have to read that when we get
[32:59] into the next part we're going to get a
[33:01] few more we never can get past this
[33:03] we're not yeah thing all right brother
[33:06] though he's caught my brother handle
[33:07] this continue this great message that
[33:10] we're endeavoring to explain this 70th
[33:12] week of day now he's went from Gabriel's
[33:17] instructions to Daniel to a six whole
[33:19] purpose now he's explaining he has
[33:21] explained the 70th week so this last
[33:23] sermon is not just 70 weeks in anal it's

[33:30] this now I didn't write that I didn't
[33:34] ever get that
[33:35] in there okay voice of God made it the
[33:39] 70th week if you want to say anything
[33:41] but that I'm sure brother Ram told on me

[33:45] we can bang so it's not to say when you
[33:47] win tonight it's the 73 my trust
[33:49] whinnies to explain this 70th week of
[33:52] damn then so many people are gathered
[33:55] and all that all right now watch he
[34:01] can't scroll down all right now my
[34:10] Pentecostal brother now Joe who wins
[34:11] brother be realized do you know with
[34:13] 144,000 here do you know for all the
[34:16] great miracles of Revelations appear
[34:18] over in the Jewish days nine hours they
[34:22] gets a literal happening we get the
[34:23] spiritual part right there is nothing
[34:26] recorded in it just the church getting
[34:27] ready and going out sure with the power
[34:30] of God we do miracles in that point we
[34:32] know that but the real thing with over
[34:34] here to the Jew I mean the real working
[34:36] power miracle-working 144,000 don't
[34:40] appear there they're over they appear
[34:43] not in the third chapter what is the
[34:45] third chapter revelation nice 13
[34:50] revelations three is us the turkey okay
[34:53] that's my brother I'm said revelation 6
[34:55] 12 relations and a penis to the Jews we
[34:57] go up and 41 bob is a scene of
[35:00] redemption 61 is the opening sealed and
[35:03] all thanks to the Jews they appeared on
[35:08] the third chapter there on over in the
[35:09] scripture further listen to 11 this with
[35:14] 144,000 come in and now we see that all
[35:17] this stuff was to take place was over in
[35:19] this time of the 70th week the last half
[35:23] of the week Oh buddy son oh this is the
[35:27] last week that's what seven years okay
[35:30] now they've already had 69 weeks oh boy
[35:34] and lived it exactly the way God said
[35:39] they would sounds like a preacher
[35:42] make a mistake don't think so it
[35:46] happened exactly the way God said it
[35:48] would do then there's one more week
[35:53] promise to the two if I alright with
[35:59] that now that he asks them I understand
[36:03] up at this point that it's perfectly the
[36:07] truth it's the Bible it's the prophetic
[36:11] year sounds like a Maddux confused huh I
[36:13] didn't think something all right ok
[36:18] let's take now one stop right here just
[36:25] moments playing this one day rejected
[36:26] them aside was when they of course
[36:28] rejecting Jesus suceder and crucified
[36:31] that's when he was cut off Isaiah 53
[36:34] said his generation was cut off to talk
[36:36] through the Bible remember hear what the
[36:38] Bible said that he shall be cut off but
[36:39] not from Selma sided print I think I
[36:42] approached close that prophecy hit right
[36:46] don't remember he said April the second
[36:49] 8030 he just rode into Jerusalem on
[36:51] white dong kyun in five days later he
[36:53] was crucified on Friday right so look
[36:57] how perfect that if that prophecy here
[37:00] exactly to the day exactly to the time
[37:03] and exactly the way it said it would
[37:05] this other seven this 17 weeks left 17
[37:10] years rather seven days seven year will
[37:12] hit exactly according to the sound like
[37:17] a confused man right now remember he was
[37:21] cut off God sees to deal with them they
[37:23] did not go any further they were
[37:24] scattered by the Roman Empire that was
[37:26] in AD 70 remember the temple was
[37:28] destroyed Jesus told so there won't be
[37:30] one stone left on another that's why
[37:32] they're trying to build a temple by can
[37:34] we prove that Rome has all the menorah
[37:37] and they have a Holy of Holies and I got
[37:38] everything that the Jews need put temple
[37:40] worship back alright you notice here
[37:43] where I got the cross if you look on the
[37:45] chart you see that crosses ad 30
[37:47] there's where they rejected but the time
[37:50] extended out just a little bit further
[37:51] to 70 years those tightest her own
[37:54] general destroyed Israel forty years
[37:56] later what if Jesus was healed maybe 30
[37:58] was 40 plus 30 AE 70 40 years Roman to
[38:04] destroy Israel Jerusalem scatter the
[38:06] people Titus 40 years later alright then
[38:13] he only dealt with them until they
[38:15] rejected cry so we know they sent here
[38:17] they cried let his blood be on us and
[38:19] our children and it's been ever since
[38:22] all right got it when the devil in the
[38:28] Jews will keep going to hang out now
[38:31] watch
[38:36] next time on searching sleeping through
[38:38] every one of these ages waiting and we
[38:40] which are alive a little remaining bunch
[38:42] over here remaining alive until the
[38:44] coming of the Lord when I hinder those
[38:46] with your sleep for the trumpet of God
[38:47] shall sound and the dead in Christ shall
[38:49] rise I'd be literate come but I be right
[39:06] a painter hit it
[39:09] yeah I think that's it yeah cuz he
[39:12] upheld the coming of the Lord will not
[39:16] enter those which are sleep for the
[39:17] trumpet Adagio sound the dead in Christ
[39:19] shall rise first and we will be caught
[39:20] up together with them a man with them
[39:21] here we are meeting right here I'm sure
[39:25] he's marking it right on this chart brie
[39:28] shows the rapture on his chart right
[39:36] hands he said right there after that
[39:39] stone that's the rapture now look where
[39:42] did the Maasai get caught exactly where
[39:45] the word said where will that seven if
[39:47] we begin exactly after this church is
[39:51] cut off then God returns to the Jews
[39:54] when will that 70th week begin exactly
[40:00] after this church is cut off hmm right
[40:06] ok now let's read one morning we'll go
[40:11] then we'll stop with starla national
[40:12] next next week
[40:21] now you protestant say well now that's
[40:23] it just a moment we find out that the
[40:25] Protestants has an organization makes a
[40:27] confederation of churches and image to
[40:29] the Beast and go right with them and we
[40:32] find out here that the Jews are called
[40:34] in on this Confederation yes sir and
[40:36] they agree and the Bible said they did
[40:39] and he makes a covenant with them you
[40:41] home Daniel 9 27 in the midst of the
[40:44] 70th week he Brett the Antichrist brings
[40:49] his covenant with the Jew by people 1c
[40:55] in revelation 11 i'll send they're
[40:57] coming on over here toward 19 he will
[40:59] send His two prophets know prophesied
[41:01] that time and they'll get angry with
[41:02] these prophets and actually kill them
[41:04] dead body shell and spiritual streets
[41:07] called Sodom in tomorrow which are warm
[41:08] food fight Jerusalem that right they lay
[41:11] there for three days and nights and
[41:12] after three days and nights the spirit
[41:13] of life he's quote scripture well coming
[41:16] to them they'll be raised up and go into
[41:18] glory all right when the church goes up
[41:23] then they make that Confederation so
[41:25] there's no way to do that that treaty
[41:28] can see if you do it like the people in
[41:30] other most people the message if you
[41:33] take daniel 9 27 that the branch will
[41:35] make a covenant with many for one week
[41:37] well he made it three and a half years
[41:39] when jeep while Jesus was still here
[41:41] literally was still here okay that's all
[41:46] it's a well I mean it's just too far off
[41:48] till they get so mad and they start
[41:49] growing their own charts and I'm sorry
[41:52] but that's just not the way it is
[41:54] brother Ram will read it next week that
[41:57] brother what's your son here is that
[42:00] right what is that in the middle of this
[42:03] last 70 years we know when he's coming
