the Lord good to see eachone turn around Shake somebody's hand say God bless you God bless you God bless you all good job well we're here we were trying to think the other day and I think 1978 was the last time I was in in this building I was a young scrapping boy getting ready to go to college and and no I didn't go to Mark Hill some of you thought I did but I did get a scholarship from there but I didn't go I I went to a college around town and played baseball and my football but uh if I went to Mars Hill I'd been up here a lot more cuz I love this place this is good I love it up here I I enjoy the people and I'm sorry it's been this long since we have not f don't say Amen if you want to not going to scare me death I promise you but I appreciate uh brother Andre opening up his pull pit and opening up his time and put forth the effort all of you I can't call all your names here in in irn but but God bless you and thank you for what you've done you really really put on show and we really appreciate that could not have we have been a starving Bunch it' have been had been for y'all right but some good food and and some good fellowship and we sure enjoyed it and then all the ones from our church probably about half is here and half at home for the bobs with them now but uh thank you for coming and putting forth an effort that takes an effort to to come up and and take two or three days out of your time and and commitments and commit to uh to coming up here and fellowshipping I know some of you uh do know the background that we used to come up here a lot when we were younger and we all looked a lot younger and acted a lot younger but now we're older the Bible says that's right now we're older we come to a time where we've got older many have passed many have left many are on the other side waiting on us amen that's right waiting on us to what come to Perfection yes cuz there will be a group I believe in the end time that will stand and look at death and as you were saying saying last night Say Bo amen you have no hold on me am because we come to a place where God is going to indwell us so much that we'll be the living breathing moving instrumentality of God so the prophet tells us amen and we sure do know that by for knowledge God you would be here today and everybody would be here and everybody brother Joel good to have you with us today and he did a wonderful job night we didn't speak a lot of time y'all accuse us preachers of talking to each other about sermons we really don't but we're going to talk about David a little bit today so if you were there last night you'll get part of it and then you'll get the rest of it today but but we sure do appreciate brother Joel coming pourn out his heart and we've always enjoyed being around him you sure do appreciate him so if you got your Bible let's turn to the Book of Luke I do want to say before we get started uh from all of us at spoken word church and my dad U Back in the back brother samel Dale youall know him you've known him for years and years and years I want to read you a scripture that come to my heart just a few minutes ago and as brother Louise said we you know there's history between the two churches from a long time ago and we kind of drifted off apart from each other and as brother Jack said it was time for us to get all back together we got it all back together now he said he been he been wanting for a long time I hope that was your desire that we just don't hate each other so much we don't want to live with each other for an eternity hello don't start going tomatoes and we're good Ephesians 2:14 says for he is our peace now that's not what I'm going to read but this is what come thought just a few minutes ago he is our peace who have made both one yes and have broken down the middle wall of petition amen between us I believe that amen been dissolved done away with don't need it no more we need God we need God to to to when we when we think about we don't want to think about how we can hurt somebody we want to think about how we can help somebody amen So today we're going to speak just a few minutes I know the weekend's been long and like I said again sure do appreciate all of you but we're going to uh have the word of God and then then go and eat and then head back home and I hope it won't be 50 more years before we get together again I'm going to make sure that I'm just going to make my way up here and surprise come on Brother come on okay I knew that'd be all right anyway I'm coming anyhow so we're going to speak today on anointed for a purpose yes sir you all walked in this door for a purpose you live your life for a purpose you live your life in in in life for a purpose in Christ for a purpose and as his bride for a purpose all right you did not come here here where God just said okay I'll bring this one here no you have a purpose right and I believe that that we're all now under an anointing that's even different from all the church ages yes am I with me yes my group you better say Amen thank you oh that's week I told him I said if Tennessee well not Tennessee Georgia was playing he'd be shouting all over the place but you know different anointing Luke 4:1 17 but good to see each and every one of you we we we believe it or not we've already of you often and and from Brother wood who married junor I to all of you and I saw some wedding pictures of the them some of you were there and he's a lot younger but we sure do appreciate him we you the foundation that was laid like like brother Andre and different ones was saying the foundation was laid with brother Dale brother WBY Brother Richard Wilson different ones that lay the foundation that we stand on today yes we don't stand on a foundation that's that that's that's out there that's changed doctrines that's moved this and forgot that and I was telling you at church the other day you know we've we've had just two pastors that Spoken Word Church brother Ernest Mo and dad and that's been for 52 years we celebrated our anniversary just a couple weeks ago July 4th and um we sure appreciate God letting us have some stability stability even in your human life is what we want you don't want turmoil you want stability so now in the word of God we have received stability and we are we are resting on that and I'm resting on that we're going to take this to the coming of the Lord amen we're going to see that and I just I'm just dumb enough to believe I'm going to be one of them amen you push me out but I okay I'll bring you with me so we're going to speak on anointed for a purpose listen to this in Luke 4: 17 and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah now this is Jesus yes coming into the temple we're going to start from the beginning and go all the way through but this is a this is the kind of the hinge point of what we're going to talk about cuz brother Brown calls this the greatest anointing ever on the face of the Earth amen was right here this scripture that's it wasn't shouting it wasn't speaking in tongues it wasn't running the aisles he opened the book amen amen now listen Jesus is the only one that can open a book and he's the only one that can close a book so when we get finished with this he closed the book amen and he handed it back now are we living in a closed book age no we're living cuz Christ came and he opened the book a little prophet in the end time we believe that Luke 4:17 and when he had opened the book they handed him a closed book he took it and he opened it he found the place where it was written oh by the way Jesus was in church y'all ought to try that some time the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me now listen Jesus was almighty God Amen he was the Holy Ghost all right he didn't need the Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost amen all right everybody with me but there's an anointing that comes after you receive the Holy Ghost because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach Deliverance to the captive well praise the Lord recovering the sight of the blind that was me we were all blind and set it Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he closed them over and he gave it to the minister and sat down and all eyes were on him yes fasioned on him they're like man we've never heard this you know why they never had the word read the B they had never had the word read the word that's right they were reading the word but the word was reading the word he made it Li because he began to say to them this day this scripture in this building is being fulfilled amen amen let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for this time that we have thank you for this opportunity to speak to to the greatest people that ever walked on the face of the Earth and Lord you know I mean that truly there's no greater office than being here Lord speaking to your people yes father I pray that You' be with the each one Lord open our blinded Eyes Lord open our ears that we may see and hear you Lord you be the active participant in this service Lord please don't be a bystander Lord come in and take over father and you be the one that speak to the people and the one that reveals to them Father there be any sick here Lord I know there's there's many ones that are that are afflicted in the body I pray Lord that you'd give them a quickening power today that you'd heal their body Lord if anybody's sick here in their soul lord we need more than anything we need a healing of the Soul Soul father I pray that you would as the word Goes Forth that it will sanctify a group of people for this journey that we're on yes be with brother Andre Lord and the work he's doing here father one of the most humble men I know one of the weakest man I know but meekness is not weakness weakness is strength and I appreciate him Lord and I thank you for putting him in my life and putting him in our brothers and sisters life here just be with each one now take care of us in Jesus name amen you can be seated all right so getting started we want to look at Luke 4:1 17 there's a up or down down how that that good maybe me I got any teeth you want to fall out I'm not like you for I going fall out on their attach maybe so the word anointing means when you anoint something it means now this is literally what it means it means to smear something on you or spread a liquid cuz that's what they did in the Old Testament they put oil on the priest and anointed them with a literal oil that's right now we know that that was done away with in the Old Testament but now we see anointings in the spiritual realm we the anointings where it falls on you like I know many in this building as old as we all are we've had we've had different anointings you've had an anointing to maybe speak in tongues or you've had an anointing to do this or you've had an anointing like I had one time where it felt like rain was falling on just the sweetest raindrops that was falling on me and I didn't want it to stop I wanted to stay there but of course it goes and moves because it's an anointing it doesn't stay and dwell like the Holy Ghost does is everybody with me we'll get it somewhere because we're anointed for a purpose every one of of us even the anointed ones at the end time they're anointed for a purpose even we're going to read here in the Book of Ezekiel Satan was anointed that's right that's right and that's why he can anoint you amen so the word anointing means to smear or spread like a liquid also means to consecrate but in the spiritual real it means a supreme quickening power and we're reading where brother said supreme power in control we know that all right we'll get to that that was the greatest anointing and and that's what we're looking at brother Joel we're look we're not looking so much for a a shout or or or speaking in tongues or or even healing we need healing absolutely we need healing of our body but until we get this thing changed it's still going to get old it's going to get old and keep getting falling keep falling apart we keep having to put parts back on going in the spirit though we see that it's a supreme quickening power because when the anointing came on Jesus he said I've been anointed to preach amen he was the preacher but he was anointed to be the preacher right he was anointed before the the the the uh religious people of the day let's say the the Pharisees and Sadducees he was in church and he opened that book and man they never heard a guy preached like this why there was anointing on it right even the way he probably said the same word that the priests have said for years and years and years but he he read Isaiah way different than they did you know why because he made it personal now come on I want us to make it personal right make it this is a personal gospel I don't want it to be a gospel that CH Ronnie uh Johnson gospel I want one for myself I'm just a little bit selfish when it comes to that I want God to anoint me I want God to save me that's okay I want everybody to be saved but Save Me Lord right so in the spirit Realm it's a supreme quickening power so keep that in the back of your head yes I'm not going to be real fast I'm going to slow down a little bit because we got a little bit of time appreciate that I don't have a button in my mouth but I do have a watch that stops don't let's go to Ezekiel 28:14 Thou Art the anointed cherub that cover now this is God speaking of Lucifer that's right right he's not speaking of Michael he's not speaking speaking of his Angel he's speaking of the one he created to be the worship Angel amen and brother dick Addison used to hate for me to tell you know i' be preaching along I even boy knows he's laughing everybody remember brother like you know but I told him I said Satan was God's first song leader he was he was an anointed Char he was supposed to be and look that cover so had a covering on him he had an anointing on him and look he wasn't ugly he was beautiful and I have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God in other words he walked around where God was that's right amen thou H has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou were created so now remember Satan had a beginning right but we got to see that we don't amen right and then we got to pull this thing apart just for a minute because Lucifer was created and anointed yes right everybody with me he was created and anointed he was created and anointed the Bible says until iniquity was found in him so he made a choice even Satan had a choice anybody with me sat have a choice listen God had a choice he have to choose you he he don't need you for nothing he don't need the hair that he created to bre he don't need something to stand on he was before all of us amen but we sure need him amen amen we sure need him and in needing him there's our father amen amen as I tell the church the other day we're on brotherly kindness when you call somebody brother brother Joel now I don't care what skin color he is he's my brother he's in the family of God so when we say God bless you brother God bless you Sister amen you have pulled them into your family yes and we have the same father amen amen we have the same father so I say brother Donnie I'm not just saying oh that's brother Donnie no he's my brother I have a brother and sister back here they're my literal brothers and sisters all right but you are my literal brothers and sisters in the gospel just as much in the family of God and a lot of us that don't have family that are serving the lord your church family is your the best family you got that's right amen I'm just fortunate that my family's my church family do natural family but there was a guy named Lucifer he was created and anointed everybody with me right he had a beginning and he's going to have an end even though he's listen that anointing has not come off of him right that's right that anointing is still on him he's just using it different than what God give it to him for in the first place everybody with me here right so in Genesis 1 I know most of everybody that goes to my church realizes that we going to talk about Genesis 1 just about every sermon I preach to me Genesis 126 and 27 tells everything tells Redemption everything is going to happen where you're going what you're doing you're going to have dominion you're going to have power you're going to be male and female as brother Joel was saying they're having a problem with that noway I am not you shouldn't either amen there's never a man had a baby that's right all right so there you are you're separated genesis: 126 says and God standing there in eternity and he said I need somebody to talk to I need somebody to fellowship with I need I need a family yes and they're inside me right and I'm going to get them out God can only do that amen and he knew exactly who they were now listen this Genesis 126 man was not every man that was created on the face of this Earth by I know brother I know brother Andre he knows it you heard it for years and years genesis6 is God's people Amen to me that is an extension of God yes it's actually God in another form because I know it says he created but remember you got to look at that word as he fashioned all right he fashioned a group of people in His image everybody with me but now he created Satan over here separate created him give him an anointing give him a job all right these people this genis 126 group of people is not an anointing right amen it's the person of God in another form called a bride so you didn't have a beginning but yeah you were formed you were created so man you know God created man in his own image and image of God created to him male and female created to them I don't mean the Bible for that quoted it so many times but look at what happened list you say well I still see that word created you know that all the computers all these benches all this steel your car that you drove here was in the garden of nothing new Under the Sun it was laying out there in the element and and then all of a sudden in about 1912 or somewhere a man named Henry Ford he created an automobile he didn't create it like God would create it he created it from the substance that was already here that's right all right so he fashioned or formed a car all right we drive that car it had the beginning but the elements that it had the elements you were originally made of will never go away that's right he fashion You In His Image and then he knew you would come here and he knew you would want it so he had it there to give it to you he didn't have to go scrambling through through his inventory and go Joel Brown I don't want to fight no he already knew were going to be and now Genesis 126 man like I said it's not an anointing it's an image it's God an extension of God it's something that he wanted to express and he wanted to be able to see but we know what happened in the Garden of Eden right right Lucifer was so anointed he knew what the plan of God was and he stepped in make a long story short we know what happened in the garden I don't have to go through it all right and that marred as the prophet of God said Mar the Masterpiece but remember brother R said the Maring of the Masterpiece is what made it the Masterpiece this right here may be your worst enemy but God wanted you in this human flesh for a purpose amen so your birth your new birth is not your anointing and it's not your adoption that's right right I'll read you a quote here that's right out the adoption Series so you've got your you've got your regular birth we're not going to talk about that anymore we're just going to everybody's born again I'm going open my eyes okay everybody's born again all right so everybody has a piece of that Genesis 126 in your soul the old you were was burned out the nature that was attached to your soul was burnt done away with the old you's dead now those you still alive you got two husbands and you can't do that right right the old husband can't be put up and divorced and put in the closet he's got to be d e a d Dead all right but in in killing that then God brings the new birth or the birth to you that he wanted in first place amen that Genesis 126 man in the Garden of Eden he wanted you to be there he wanted you to come the way he wanted you to come by Spoken Word not by the way they came and listen everybody in this building came the same way that's right I don't care how big little short fat skinny all of you are pretty but you all came the exact same way in aen all right so ain't no big eyes a little you we know where we come from and if we don't get this thing and and and and get out of here we know where the end is all right so let that's my whole point I want us to grow amen every Minister for brother Dev but Richard different ones they have preached a growth you got to grow you can't stand baby you've got to grow amen nothing worse than seeing a m nourished child go ahead brother nothing worse than seeing a malnourished Christian Child somebody supposed to be in the message 40 years and still act like they're 10 brother still need to be sucking on a bottle instead of eat meat right come on now God give me these right here they're incizors they're to tear meat with amen I like milk yeah milk's okay A little bit of it right but listen an eagle is the only animal in those four combat Beast that was born to not drink milk at its birth the lion at its birth Ox the man all three of those you had to have milk to get started with that's right but the eagle no the eagle just stands there and opens his little mouth and Mama chews a word up every Sunday and every Wednesday come on somebody amen chew that up and takes and breaks it down into little bitty pieces and doesn't choke you with it she knows how to put it down in there not kill that baby but once that baby grows up he goes and says rabbit F food and here he goes and takes off he doesn't need his mama to do it for him anymore that's what I want to be I don't want the mama to have to do listen I want to come to a doct where we don't have to cry Daddy and Daddy all the time amen we don't have to find Donnie Ren or or any of these brothers I got to find Pastor now how I doing it for yourself I could F my pastor one day and I had to call on my real dad that's what I want us to do learn to call on your real dad sure we have to have Apostles Prophet Pastor teachers demand that's that anointing that we were given and we were talking about yesterday those were predestinated gifts GI to the church to what perfect her amen you can't do it press do series 196 brother Ry talking about ask questions now what is adoption so I want to set this precence just for a minute I won't have time to get through it brother said now back to the book he said your adoption is not your birth all right so your birth is here and your adoption is here and then all the other anointings that we're going to talk about in a few minutes so now you say well I'm born again and brother Ram said when you were born again you got everything you needed for your journey well listen when you were born a baby you didn't gain no new part right when you about 80 might have lost a few but you didn't gain anything right you were born a human you had five fingers five toes on each hand and feet you had a mouth you had two eyes but you couldn't drive a car right not when you were 10 12 14 16 I hope not much but why we were still human that's right right we hadn't come to a position yet right amen we haden't come to a position in God yet for him to give us the keys to the car that's right and say go on son this is yours you drive it that's right it's yours this is your word I produced it I put it here I made it for you now I'm going to give it to you and see what you can do about it right that's why I want us to come well we can take car ke well we don't have to be nervous well we don't have to be uh uh frustrated because listen out there's frustrated enough let's go be in the gospel God will help you if you ask him to the problem is we don't ask him we think we got it all figured out sometime and we don't but you know what if you're a child of God he's going to give you one of those stimulation things I talking about last night and he's going to make you go back in line and that's what he's doing now what a wonderful father Yes a wonderful God he is thank you Lord sir want to read this quote from the believer's position in Christ 1955 I wish we had on the screen we have screen at the church and I'm sorry if I keep reading scripture real fast and you're not turning pages to get to it as usually already popped up on the screen so I I apologize for that but it is better for you to read it then you know then I'm not telling you something different that's right so look now God our Father he's praying now listen this he's praying and God we're trying our best and following you and everything that we do or say sent him into the building just now now why did he need somebody in the building he was a prophet he had the Holy Ghost obviously there's no way we can deny he he didn't have the Holy Ghost that man had baptism of the Holy Ghost but he needed an anointing to come into that room or into that where he was having prayer line we speak have a prayer line he said what I'm waiting on him why is he waiting on him that's an anointing a special yes part that come down into his life and then it would go off of him he said he would you know they take him back and he have headaches for days and they said he'd be dizzy and didn't know what he was doing well that was an anointing that came on him but the thing came off of it right that's right but he still had the Holy Ghost amen amen well listen he's praying send him into the building Lord put a fresh anointing on every Minister here in every lady well I say the same thing today method Baptist Presbyterian catholic whatever you are father they're here because they love you and we're groaning waiting for that time of adoption and we believe now this is the prophet now you believe God sent a prophet I just want to make sure the same congregation some of Y there only three of you that do I must have come this a wrong building how many believe God you need to go you need to find the Lord and we'll pray for you after service go we're groaning waiting for the time of adoption and we believe that one of these days the Holy Spirit look will move in not with the new birth he makes that specific common not with the new birth for for we've received that through Christ but you'll adopt your church then amen everybody with this from believer position in Christ 1955 then she'll be clothed in the power of the resurrected Lord and we pray father that you do this quickly for the day looks so dark 1955 yes right the day looks so dark and evil ahead we pray that you'll adopt us now Lord into your family give us the authority that we need father to make the gainsayers keep still that's what I want I want these naysayers that don't believe brother R was a prophet that don't believe this message is true I want that their their qual will be made manifest amen amen 1954 question questions and answers oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all theologies failed to do in 2000 said you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that Faithful Little Remnant yesen after the doors of the Gentile church is close oh God will anoint a church then so there's an anointing coming my folks my brother you believe that there's an anointing coming that we've not even had before we're there though God will anoint a church then he who filthy let him be filthy still he who's righteous let him be righteous still he who is Holy let him be holy still and God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will take place not only that then but he's doing it now right so there's not there's there is one coming a great one coming but there's one he was saying there's one here too 55 that's and there is one the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ in word form the word's got to be anointed right it doesn't matter if you be you're the word's got to be anointed if we know the words anointing and when that anointing comes into you it anoints you all right but let's look just for a minute with the Old Testament and types and shadows cuz we know you can't do away with the Old Testament the Old Testament is given as we said for an example the Bible says for an example for us that the end of the Earth was coming to so it's for us to look back I mean how many people have heard you know teachings on Abraham and I know some of you may have came from another denomination or or something that they yeah they'll talk about this and Father Abraham but they never really knew who Abraham was the prophet of God knew who Abram was and who Abraham was amen and he taught us the difference in the two amen amen Abram didn't have the promised son Abraham had the promised son so there had to be a change and then then thank God a prophet told us they had a body chain you won't hear that anywhere else in but they it's it's proven they had a body chain uh 300 you know you they took a 300 M journey and and you don't know brother R told the story about the the King sitting there with his many hundreds of wives and they're just as beautiful here comes 99y old Sarah and he wants her oh she had a body change so that's what we're looking for but we got to meet me cous first you got to meet God in human flesh before that happens we'll talk about that in just for a minute Exodus 30: 30 we just read this real quick I know we understand this we've heard it talked many times Thou shalt anoint Aon and his sons and consecrate them so they literally poured this oil onto these uh uh to Aaron and his sons for them to go do the job in the temple all right everybody with me it was a holy anointing oil and I'll just paraphrase this the same time God told him said Do Not Duplicate thisen I'm going to have it make one way Do Not Duplicate this Holy Ghost it's only going to come one way and it's going to come by justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not going to come now listen there's a lot of people going to be Anointed with the Holy Ghost is going to go to hell amen you can get quiet if you want this but it's the truth this shall be a holy anointing oil unto me through your Generations you shall not make any like it after the composition of it it is Holy leave it alone he said whoever compounded it or maketh this anointing oil just reg oil he's going to be cut off from people they're kicking him they'll kick you out you're not an Israelite anymore and they kick you out that's how that's how strong it is that's just in the Old Testament all right everybody with me so now Moses look let's look at Moses the Bible tells us that that Moses killed an Egyptian and Moses made a lot of mistakes but when Moses was speaking for God his face Shone so much until they had to turn away and he had to cover this face now that was an anointing what a strong anointing that was all right because it would come off of him he didn't keep that all the time but he had an anointing to speak instead of God or in God step because remember when he said flies flies came when he said frogs frogs came there was a creation in his voice now remember Moses was not born again right everybody with me Moses was not born again the Old Testament there was no one born again that's right they had anointing but they weren't born again right okay even John the Baptist not born had the hold that's for a different subject think about that for a little while you prach on that later 1954 Ser be of good cheer watch this look at Jonah the prophet after receiving inspiration that kept him alive in the whale's belly what an anointing to be in a whale's belly yes and preach with such inspiration to a city the size of St Louis all of repented and then after the spirit left him he s under a little tree a gourd tree and prayed God let me die all right look at Elijah the prophet after calling fire down out of Heaven called Rain Out of Heaven the same day the spirit left him he run into the Wilderness and Jezebel he was afraid of that woman right so that's the anointing that came on and then that anointing came off and he became just a normal person all right but we'll look at something though because there's something the Bible tells us about one individual that says you see the spirit descend right yes and remain amen that by with right we know who that is all right so that's what we're getting to for now look at Samson Samson now listen Samson what didn't look like all for that's right you know the when when you watch a Samson movie and when you got this guy that's you know just all packed out and everything no he a little big kid looking kid couldn't he be the water boy on the football game cuz he cries he stumped his toe that's seven little pretty little curls but when the anointing that he was purposed for anointing for a purpose he was anointed for that purpose to destroy the Philistines as long as he kept that anointing on him he was oh he could pick up tons tons those Gates weigh tons not just hundreds of pounds tons he just pick them up go set them down that see that was a mystery it wouldn't be a mystery if he was as big as arold Sports ner or somebody like that that would be the mystery they know oh he's just strong he works out no he's a little strip boy and walking around all humped over you know and all of a sudden he kills a thousand of them well that's why they wanted to know why where he got his anointing from where did you get your Dr from right of course we know what happened amen he lost all that because he got out of the of God that's right but remember in the end he took out more than he did during I want to be that way I want to be if it comes down to the end brother Jo I want to be where God says enter in you've destroyed more in the end of your life than you did the first your life see D died here destroy him all right so here let's come to David now remember as brother Joel was preaching last night check yourself just a minute David was anointed to be king that's right right first Samuel 16:10 I want you to look at this real you know you believe in numbers numerology yes we believe in types we believe in numerology we had a Prophet come to tell us what a five what a four what a three what a six what a two what an eight was yes what a seven was right he told us all those numbers so let's look at this in 1 Samuel 16 because David and and taking nothing away from what brother Joel said it took faith and it took David to be at the right place at the right time but remember David had an anointing amen that's right that's right amen amen he was anointed for his kind but remember though he was anointed to be king but remember he was anointed as a boy he did not become king for years after years after that Samuel anointed him now here here's the situation now God want yall to listen God sent a prophet that's right to anoint someone to be a king his name was Sam that sound familiar go the prophet God said a prophet give him the anointing oil every I with 1 Samuel 16:10 says again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel good do it but in seven Church ages there wasn't somebody anointed to destroy the the giant that's right d was the eight Bo the Lord haveth not chosen these and Samuel said unto Jesse are here all th children and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and he stinks smells bad but he's pretty send in fet him for we will not sit down till he come now here's a problem standing at the GU door and he got this anointing oil and God sent him to that place listen God sent anointing to your place yes amen amen and he s and brought him in now he was running with all of a beautiful countenance and good to look at good looking kid and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he right cuz I'm sure Samuel when he those seven boys they were probably big tall guys and he went over to this one and God said no he didn't feel anything there was nothing well this no so that's why Sam says there's got to be one more there got to be something something something's missing right like when brother Rand in questions and answers brother George got the new seal button he asked me yesterday or Friday brother George Smith he said what's what is the greatest part of the seal book to you and everybody would say silence in heaven or this or that the greatest uh time that brother Rand the quote that I love brother R made he was on the questions and answers on the seals that morning and he said you're not getting it it's not for you yes right amen that what he that yes sir he said you're not even supposed to get it that's what he said amen amen so there was somebody Hallelujah in 2023 that's going to get it it was not for them that anointing fell it was just like samel was like nope nope not that group nope not that group and he's probably going Lord It's My People he said no not that that's not the group going to get it come on they're going to praise the lord they're going to be Christians they're going to live a good life uh they're going to live the message the best they can but there's a group coming Hallelujah they got anointed is going to fall on every man Hallelujah and she's going to be an invincible Army amen thank you brother so the Lord said arise anointed for this is he yes then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren I bet you they were probably looking at him a little bit sideways David what this this this end time bride she looks horrible somebody told me one time you know said you know said the bride looks horrible I said brother the bride ain't never look horrible that's right brother you might be looking at mix multitude and foolish bur but the bride has always been beautiful always will be beautiful you got to find her CU all Israel is not Israel that's right then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Breen the spirit of the Lord look the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward yes that it was out the field is out in his daddy's house there had been a war yet there had been a Goliath Goliath may have been a teenager you know probably 7 fo tall by then but but he had to wait a little while right so now we come up let's set this scene like the brother did last night David keeping the sheet now listen he's been anointed had put crown on him yet right he has not sit on the throne but he's been anointed yeah right that's right so and I'm sure that anointing oil of brother Lis he he probably washed it off I'm sure he still didn't have that anointing oil that he had you know for years back now he washed it off but listen you can't wash the anointing sir off of yourself you can't wash anointing out of a prayer cloth you can't wash the anointing off once it comes on you and the Bible said and Samuel said this is going to be our King right here am how it was I don't care how long it takes 60 years since the prophet left don't matter how long it takes you will be K what a consolation if you'll believe that listen try this he believ what the prophet said try that sometime that's it okay so David he's not going he's not sitting down going well I'm king I don't have to do this sheep thing no more you know I don't have to didn't know that I'm just kind of sit right here under this tree and God's going to just make me King no and you know why he was made King God knew he wouldn't do that God knew he wouldn't be frivolous in his Christian experience he would continue on even though the anointing was not always on it right that's right yeah but one day one day in his walk he hears a noise what is that you know he kind of sneaks up even his even his brothers his older brothers are like what you doing here what you doing sitting in this church right what you doing in these meetings what you doing here you're supp out there you you you ain't had a sign or a Wonder in all your life they said boy I want you to remember I killed a bear one time I killed a lion one time so I have a little bit of experience here I just had never killed a person yet okay remember he went to the to the camp here's here's all the other Church agents standing around going what you doing here I mean brother what are you doing here uh we we we thought you were you know you need to go back and take care of your sheep up Daddy's calling you David may have turned around and said yeah I probably better leave there they just don't like me being here but when he turned he heard a voice voice yes that he didn't like amen that's right he heard a strange sound right come from across the valley yes yes and that strange sound wouldn't shut up he just kept defying the armies of Israel yes he kept defying he defied he I defi this whole Army send me one oh he didn't know uh death had made it final final stand fin amen cuz there was a group of people I mean there was David brother Joel he went down and he got those five St that's it and he looked at Goliath and he didn't measure him up you know what he saw he saw a crown and a throne yes that's right am man amen you see joh no sir he saw a crown in the thr yes sir he saw a promise cuz he believed what his Prophet said amen so how could he die right how could he die you tell me how David could die if Samuel was a true Prophet a true anointing was on him he was going to be king he was undefeatable why you're undefeatable if you realize that we are doing what the prophet told us he has anointed us Amen to leave this place standing up not 6et Amen brother from what was life he was a blip in the radar all right that's why we got to look at death because all David saw was I'm going to be king I got to get through this though I got to take this test that's right I can't go around him I got to take it death where you stand yes right grave wears you Victory one day folks we're going to do the same thing death said death will crawl up your sleeve and you'll just wipe it off listen when we say death I don't care if you're a a a hardened Christian if you say death you got that little tingle in your in in your in your whatever you want to say Co we're human we see death we see what death does Amen but why are we teaching what death is let's teach what life is amen and goli was only just a bliff in his radar go was not 9 ft or 14 ft tall he was just an obstacle that David had to get get through to get to the front amen so that's why I see that I see that David was anointed to be K sure he believed that so much a bear a line didn't follow the B come up to he was like I need to go back I need to find my quot I need to go talk brother Andre I need I really got to get you know no he said hey you qu defy the army of God or something's going to happen to you buddy that's the same thing has been defying us for years but there's an anointing on this bride in the end time for somebody to stand up and say death you've been destroyed that's right amen you your watch a fairy tale well we do your funeral that's right that's right preach everybody right amen I'm just we're either going to go in here we're going to go out of here standing up or we're going to have to come up in the resurrection no shame in either one that's right no shame one at all right but don't you want to be here at the end I've heard about this all my life yes I've heard about this great thing that's coming this great Rapture this great Resurrection this great coming back together where I don't move my finger any H right where this glorified body yes is going to just materialize amen it's not fair to that no sir kids fair you can watch all that junk on DC and and comic books that's just a type of what's going to happen to you when they morphing this and morphing the that you know they become superhuman but remember they all got a flaw everyone got a flaw everyone got a cryptonite everyone got whatever you want to put in that there's not been one that stood and said I'm the Champion and never been undefeated well we have one amen and he's not in a comic book he's in your heart yes sir so let's be David let's don't be just David and throwing Stone let's just believe that we the Bible tells us we are to be what priests and King so we've been anointed right by the anointed word and we had an anointed Prophet come and give us an anointed word for an anointed people amen so Lord I looked at that real funny when they said you know when anointing means to smear like peanut butter on sandwich well you know what Lord smear me smear it on me to where me don't show no more amen they smear all over me some of yall don't want that you don't anything you want I'd like to be smeared by God yes trying to do God service without being his well 1965 good gracious bless we got all time world yes right see how the Holy Spirit now now let's look at this we got to look at the clip side because there's false anointed ones there's an anointing coming and is here now is false now the Holy Ghost is not false the anointing is I with really brother called it for false anointed on now look here's from trying to do God a service this is right about the time he preaching now not 65 he says see how the Holy Spirit can anoint man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing wow right got me it's got to be in the order of the anointing amen the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the soul is dark as pig that's right folks that's why we've had people come Among Us you have here we have at our church where they come in and then disappear yes amen but we had one this brother sat on the front row and this was the greatest thing since sliced bread and he was like right on the front row like Dad said though he was like a candle that burned both hands he burned out real quick am disappear you thought he was a candidate for being Bri but he didn't get in here he just got an anointing he got caught up in the moment I don't want us to get caught up in a moment no sir I the only time I once to get caught up is in the moment in t of ey amen right the Cleber grows on the same water that builds that puts life in the wheat but at the bottom he still a c work it's rejoicing blooming got life doing everything that the wheat does but the soul is still a c work false teachers can rise teaching all kind of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost amen and perform just as many miracles as the true God gopel can but by the word they're false that's right right amen wow how you like that tremend but remember brother BR makes he makes his specific it's got to be in the order of the anointing yes got to be in the order got to be in the right time right place all that got to be placed right right all right 1963 brother r on world falling apart you finds out we find out the same thing took place in Egypt when Moses led the children of Israel the whole Egyptian syst had become corrupt well praise God this the same thing right here in this right whole place has become corrupt we find out now Tak Place God sent an anointing messenger amen down there with his word right it was to fulfill his word that's right you say it wasn't to fulfill his word yes he told Abraham that's exactly what he would do and there had to be someone come on the scene at that time to make that word live live right before them God sent Moses remember brother many many times he said he didn't send Moses with Noah's message he didn't send Noah with Jonah I mean Jonah's message and no he sent him with the right message in other words he sent him with the right anointing all right and there had to be someone come on the scene at that time to make that word live right before them so he said God sent Moses the very thing he promised to do he did because he was the anointed word for that hour he said he would judge the world God's word said I'll judge that Nation with Great Mighty wonders and signs there stood a man just an ordinary man like you and me got the word from God and went out there and spoke creation that's right into existence that's right wow uh picked up sand and said free come from the earth and the word of God through that prophet's mouth being it was was right in the hour it was supposed to be fleas came amen right amen he covered the Earth with frogs life he covered everything because God made the promise like I said before God made David a promise to a prophet yes he was going to be a king didn't matter what he he was going to be the king amen that's right that's what we got to see yes right you know um some of my children or one of them is is out in the world but you know you can't look at the trial part right the test the joural part cuz remember what brother R say about the baby he said he saw him already with the baby cuz he got the birdie and the bir eye the booties and all that stuff all that cuz he can see that baby I see my children sitting in church I don't see that other stuff to do that's you know what I can't save them you can't save them my mom trying to save me for 20 years right your mama can't save you your daddy can't sa yeah you have father again but your daddy mama can't save you you got to go to God let God save and then I'll promise you problem won't go away but you sure learn how to handle them amen man I've always said the Holy Ghost doesn't take away all your problems but it will help you get through yes amen everybody with me God made a promise and the hour was there for it to be anointed the anointed were for that hour that they lived in that's what we need today is not back into some Seminary system but the anointed word for the hour that we live in to bring forth Jesus Christ to the world again say yesterday today and forever there's a program laid out for this day a promise of God and the only way that we're ever going to be able to get right is to let the word be anointed amen amen that's right it's always happened yes we find out the great moral pollution in the days of neverne Nebuchadnezzar he had a man anointed when the handri was on the wall he had a man standing there to read right days of why he had a man standing there right in the days of Jesus Christ we find out manmade system and got the world in such a condition their politics was rotten everything was falling apart now we done the same thing turned back around and corrupted the word of God by systematic religion can we find it falling apart there is nothing at all we can do listen there's nothing at all we can do but come back to that anointed word for your hour amen listen Luther's holy GH Luther's justification will not even put you in the body that's right amen Amen brother amen that's right Right Wesley sanctification yeah it'll clean you up make you live better you can be anointed but the baptism of holy ghost in your soul yes sir that's the word of this that's why a come to change anything he just come to tell us that's exactly what you're supposed to do be justified and Sanctified I truly believe in all three because you know what I went through all three if you can't SH now bless Lord you got to know that you know though yes sir absolutely if you can't sit down and write your story being a Christian you're not that's right I got saved right here I got Justified right here I got Sanctified right here I got filled with the Holy Ghost you got to know that yes and you got to put a state down you well I don't know well go back you got a little time you still alive still suck God justify me God sanctify me fill me with the Holy Ghost I may have been a m believer for years that's right but may be a True Believer now cuz this is anointing now for not that is to get out of here and I'll promise you one thing folks Noah preached 120 years he was anointed to preach that message but one day God said that's it that's right I'm sure Noah had friends I'm sure no one had other family members maybe you know uncle aunt whatever and he was compelling them to come in like we do come sir come on come in here but one day God shut the door and said that's it that's right no one's going in no one's coming out the days of the Gentiles are about over folks that's right and I'm not going to shut the door brother shut the door you other ministers going to shut the door God's going to shut the door say that's enough that's right that's right that's enough we've been preaching for all these years there's a time to go up we went around horor we went in the desert we've done everything we we 60 years that's right it will produce itself amen it will whether you want it you can sit there all day long like brother said you can sit there and say something ain't coming up son ain't coming up son ain't coming up bless God I'm right son ain't coming up I'll promise you about 6:15 in the morning you'll be pre wrong you'll have wasted your time the sun's going to come up amen there will be a message is a message but there will be a message anointed to carry us out here and I believe we're under nowen I truly do Matthew 3:16 now here we are let's let's look at Jesus real quick yes let's get to him we've been in the anointing in the Old Testament which came on a group of people and it would leave it would come on David he write The Great Psalms and he would do all these wonderful things but yet when the anointing came off of him he had his best friend kill amen that's right and commanded adulter and Li that's right K David would have died if he had a prophet there that's right what David say bring up man here you know D comes in and says you know this is stealing the sheep and all this stuff David old self-righteous David at the time he was King already you know already had a crown on his head he said bring bless God bring just like we bless God bring here Prophet looked at and said you're the man David that's right you're the man he said but what he said but David I prayed for you right Jesus in Matthew 17 amen John 17 for thank you Lord for me that's my Lord's Prayer you have the other one but this is my Lord's Prayer yes sir brother that's right Matthew 3: 16 say Jesus when he was baptized went straight up out of the water and lo the heavens were open and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him all right so we're watching this scene we're looking at this scene as a commentary we see Jesus we see John we see the baptism we see him come out of the water and then we see brother Albert we see this this form this and it went on Jesus right laid right on right now listen he didn't need the Holy Ghost that's right right it had to be an anointing for something for him to do yes sir he pronounced it in the Book of Luke he said preach that's it amen for 29 and2 years those silent years he might have said a few things but it wasn't for me and you that's right but that thing L on him he had a 3 and 1/2 years job amen Absolut right yes sir remember they tried to kill it many many times but with that anointing on him no sir and what anointing was that man yes sir voice said this is my beloved Son and him I'm well pleased now he didn't say here you him either right that's right man had to wait for Matthew till he went till he lived a little bit longer through his journey almost getting ready to Calvary then he goes up on a a mountain yes right and God adopts him this is my beloved Son whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye in him amen so this first part there had to be something extra that was added thank you Lord remember you get everything you need for your journey but you just don't know how to use it I believe the Bible even tells us that Jesus grew in what great and being made perfect being made perfect became the author of our Salvation it is Humanity he had issues yes yes sir he didn't want die right we look at brother Brown I was reading yesterday or the other day we we still in statute per man we brother kindness 117 119 sermon we'll get there but um brother rown tells about he had complexes he had a critical spirit get on him y know cuz I read you the quote he had a critical spirit get on him he had a selfish Spirit get on him he would have committed suicide for God wasn't that he went through the motions no he took his glove off and reached the water amen he took the gun out and loaded it he would have been a murderer also he got real mad got his 22 out loaded that thing up and I can see him running down that dirt road trying to shoot them and nothing going on he's literally trying to shoot them kid oh y'all get quiet when you start talking about a proph like that go ahead brother he was an example being there but look he overcome every one of them so can you yes sir I like it you know brother ROM he we always try to find this sorry this magic post we try to take this quote mix it in with this one and put a little scripture on it you know and and come up with this well here go wash this bar soap here go wash yourself with it this will take care of everything no brother I've got a stingy Spirit what do I do hold now brother you got to get down right here you got to look at Jesus you got to do this you got to do all this what he's tell today he said do the vice what a revelation and I know y'all mountain people know what VI means it was some great sermon no surprise give it away yes sir simple right a that to me though that's how simple Christianity is you do it right amen there is no magic potion there is no magic there there is some promises though what's this she she and yesterday day I'm sorry don't fall out sometime you call mey name and they go I know you but she said she stood the other day and she just so profound I was thinking on the same thing she said I have done what God has told me to do as far as promises for his kid for kids or whatever more XYZ cuz you got to put yourself in it to she said I've done what I'm supposed to do that's our problem a lot of time amen you know we like to put people in water and baptize them we want to get them wet I baptized a lot of wet centers because Peter said repent right amen and then be baptized amen so sister Linda said well I've done that you know she goes through and it is it is kind of a formula a little but the prophet taught us when we've done all we know to do when we' laid them in the hands of of God when we close our eyes and say God there ears what do you say when you've done everything to do he said stand stand amen that's what you done so you know what she's done she has triggered God's word and has made him do what he said he do yes amen amen made him do he cannot do it may not be today got to have patience it's rough thing but he will do it if you'll do everything thing you're supposed to do amen you see people struggle can I preach just a minute bro you let you see people struggle with finances they ain't paying their time right right I can't afford to you can't afford not to that's right why I got all these issues at s in church in three weeks this one what you do what God said he's got to honor what he what he he's got to honor his word and that's our anointing the anointing for the end time is for God to do what his word said he would do amen all in a nutshell yes sir that's what you and I are here to do say God you said it now you're going to have to change my body I can't amen cuz I keep getting older and older there's an 18y old inside there yes sir if you got to be birth cuz remember that 126 man not old no sir he's 18 years old it's that picture it's that album that God took that you're created in that image he had to get your mom and daddy here to bring you your image here but God must really like it cuz brother not going to be 6450 lb in in in in future home still going to have to heyo right cuz he lik you the way you are amen that's right me the way I am I love him too that it's true God Made You for a purpose that's right if he made the devil for a purpose praise God he made you for a purpose all right so let's continue just for a minute is every all right that food's getting better about 1:30 this afternoon we'll sit down and eat natural food but let's just eat a little those let's see what God said about us first John 1:32 says though John byar record what saying I saw the Spirit now John was a prophet like brother R was a prophet I was looking in one of your books you can see the hood remember brother R said there a hood over there sister I see he was looking at real that nobody had ever seen he saw things sometimes he said I had to pit myself to see if I'm in this Dimension or in this Dimension he was so much back and forth praise God we don't have to do that amen I want to thank everyone of y'all love me I don't want to discern the you don't listen when they when they H brother's neck he knew if they like him or not he knew he knew it I don't want to know that I one think everybody love it drive me you know he drive everybody crazy but brother Brown he's only one got get just what I mean about that he picked that person he picked that character that brother R could handle that you and I can't handle that I love one another preacher said one time he said you know brother R stood up maybe two or three times in his in during his his um sermons and he say you know he said I can't keep a secret I just can't keep a secret we s together pra God he can't keep a secret I'm glad he told me everything God told him that we needed I'm glad he didn't take that with him I'm glad he gave us 1100 sermon that that was God talking to me and you before we've had the end time folks we've had it laid in the flat right here and most don't want right so anyway so here's John here's John here's a prophet he's in the water and he he baptized Jesus and he said I say saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove it wasn't a dove it was like a dove so it fluttering down and ab upon him I B upon him everybody with me you reading it John 1: 32:33 and I knew him not right but he that sent me to baptize with water which was the one that led him out of the Wilderness which was the Father which was Jehovah God orever however you want to say his name the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him there's no doubt he had been around maybe some of the Pharisees or maybe even Kus he'd seen cus and being a prophet he could see cus heading toward the the temple and he see an anointing fall on him yes right but when cus come out he see that anointing leaving he see those Pharisees he' see anointing fall on them and you see anointing leave them that's right right but God instructed the prophet he says whatever the ones you see whatever the one he didn't say a bunch he said one that's it's a bunch now but he said whoever you see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as which baptizes with the Holy Ghost right so remember he didn't need the Holy Ghost that's he was the Holy Ghost amen Bible says his Spirit was a spirit son times and maners SP to the prophets brother said the Holy Spirit right so so you know you can believe whatever you want to about Jesus being a normal man over here and then being God over here be careful that's right you make him another person you make him schizophrenic if you had two or three personalities inside of that's right all right I just believe he born Emmanuel God would that's enough for what the Bible says all right he wasn't part God he was all God that's what brother R said I'll read it to minut he said we get it by measure he got it without measure right so without measure means everything means the whole Cup right right but he didn't have a human side he did have a human flesh didn't have a human brain then he had to live because he had to live like me and you he had to be like us brother that's right amen so now remember we look and we see now I want you to kind of polish your brain off a little bit we know that the prophet of God told us that when Jesus stood and he said who men say that I am right some say your L some say this some say that so who do you think I am I'm asking you today what do you think this message is about well well I I've heard T I've heard brother I heard I want to know what you know about it I want to know what you say about it I want to know you're experence if you don't have one you need to fight and get one but God is Spirit anybody with me what the Bible say but that Spirit came into human flesh John 1:1 we've been reading it for 119 sermon in the beginning was the word yes the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh right now how many of y'all thought about Jesus when I said that I know my people did I thank you me amen I thank you you brother the word has now become flesh in yourh sure it did right there but that's our example but right here today and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the world is going to know just for a moment that God walked in a bunch of people on this Earth yes sir amen right just for a [Music] moment and listen if you're somewhere else just like my daddy's always said if you want to take a train trip a trip on the train don't buy a ticket it's Airline now that's SP at the wrong place at the wrong time but you got to take it well you got to take it to the wrong place right place right time all right let's go son of man though the Son of God is Spirit God everybody with you right that's right the son of man though was the preacher he was the word made flesh he was the one they could hold on to they never understood that man never understood they knew there was it was parts of that would say there's something about you even even even um Peter said th are the Christ right the son of the Living God he didn't say son of man that's that's right CU Jesus asked him a question who do thou say out of son of man out he didn't even answer the question cuz he didn't know the question that's right he just knew there was something about that guy but on the day of Pentecost when that man came back into that group of people yes and I'm going to tell you something if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost who wrote this the Holy Ghost wrote this man that's right right now if you open it it's the Holy Ghost reading what the Holy Ghost wrote amen and if it's Christ if you got the true baptism of the ho GH you can't say something and me can't say something this this can't say something different got to say the same thing that's why the son of man Ministry had to come back in the end time under the Son of God Ministry listen just just for a few minutes under the Son of God Ministry Luther could preach trinitarian baptized name father son Holy Ghost God winked in his IGN because he didn't that wasn't the time that wasn't the an anointing for that moment that's right John Wesley the same way he could preach trinitarian Doctrine and God would say oh that's okay I just want you to do this I want you to get my people Sanctified amen amen come to the Pentecostal I want you to be able to to uh expound on the gifts I want you to be able to use the gifts cuz I'm going send a prophet see if God would sent a prophet in Luther's a our Prophet people would be going like whoa this is fanatical but he sent by the random right that Pentecostal time he just stepped right in he believed in tongues he believed in interpretations he believed in healing so it was just thought stepping right up the line amen putting those Pentecostals right where they needed to be gave them anointing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost fact the truth was speaking in tongues and the truth even even when it fell Pentecost that fell on trinitarians yeah that's right they didn't have it all right that's right but they had some things right but then you come up with the one that's grou then you got brother R teaching what going back and teaching us what Paul said teaching us what Peter said everybody with me so we look and see that brother Rand he comes and he preaches his message and he tells the people like on the seals you said you're not getting it but remember in the church book brother said this messenger of Malachi 4 has come to do two things yes amen you I can quote it without even looking at it amen right first to turn the hearts of the children back children bab babies Pentecostal babies back to the faith of the father yes right back to water baptism correct back to where there's no eternal hell back to where there's not Sor to Soul that's now I'm not getting into do but you see what it was it was he was bringing us back to that right but then he said it was going to do two things yes amen the second one is remember the book was closed back in about ad30 or ad2 something Jesus closed the book right I read you the scripture he closed the book hand it back to the preacher right now Revelation 10:7 that same man P the book open again that's right and precious words 1100 sermon proceeded out of his mind amen amen and now we're working this day to scripture not a day 24-hour day remember thank God for a prophet one more time everybody believe brother was prophet make sure y some back again but you look and see that John was in the spirit on the Lord's day brother said that wasn't a 24-hour day when I say Lord bless this day I mean the day of the Bride not your 24-hour day the day of the Bride the day when we're supposed to manifest not just the Son of God but the son of man we're to be the preacher yes right that's why people are killing the influence of apostle Pro Apostle Pastor teaching and evangelist that's killing that why Satan hates that he knows if he can stop the ministry he can stop the amen but don't we believe in promises amen we made it Revelation 5 said we did yes sir made us Kings and Priests amen so somebody made it prise God let me read this real quick and we'll close right here brother 1955 Jesus had the greatest anointing of any man now listen that great anointing was on him to preach the gospel right what came on him at the River Jordan was an anointing for a Ministry of 3 and 1/2 years because that's why what's happening now we're under the son of man Ministry so we're getting that same three and 1/2 year message sir that Jesus preached everybody with me but now remember there was a time that that anointing came off with Jesus that's right yes siren Jesus had the greatest anointing of any man ever on the earth is that right one day he went into the temple they gave him a scroll he picked it up he sat down and read Isaiah where said the spirit of the Lord is upon me and preach the acceptable year and so forth brother ground talking the juile year he put that in there and he took the scroll and handed it back and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth the greatest anointing that was ever on the earth amen all Methodist look noes ain't anointing I'm read that one more time yes oh sometimes we methodists get noise confused with anointing noise boy you can't get a meth shout right no no you you're right about that no ain't anointing no no I've seen a lot of noise and not faith enough to cure two things you got to come solemnly to the father you got to know exactly where you stand Amen brother why am I people so talked about 1956 some people get the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing that ever was to anyone what did they do when they had the anointing yes the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure all right and one day he entered into the temple and he picked up the scroll and he read the spirit of God is upon me for he has anointed me to preach acceptable year bind up the broken heart heal the sick give s to the blind now we would think if such anointing was on him there had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him that we would want to run all over the building screaming and hollering but the Bible said he put the scroll down sit down precious words proceeded from his mouth here's the thing that's what he done under that anointing the anointing is not emotional that's right the anointing is supreme power am amen now he G us a Comm like knowing exactly what and how do amen here you amen sir amen so now let's look real quick I think ring son brother tell us we know the Spirit came on him on the River Jordan yes aned him for a Ministry which was the ministry of the son of man he preached the perfect word of God he preached every doct true do whever was they got all the fal out of it but he preached all the true doct yes sir all right everybody with but now look 1965 now notice this quickening power Zoe musicians come up bring word the mind that was in Christ was in you then I'll try to show you that when you raised when God raised Jesus from the dead he raised you also right right Amen brother you believe that I do cuz that Genesis 126 man was inside of that man all bottled up all encapsulated you know if you take a you take a pill I don't have a bit I cook them a minute ago but the is the vitam in the outside no that's Galatin that when he gets into your stomach it disolve right that ought to be a sermon he's not going to do you any good medicine's on the inside and also Quicken to life with him you are now Quicken to life although when you were but an attribute in his thoughts but God saw all in him at the finish so now he's saying at the Finish yes is it's not the Finish amen okay this is the finish so he's talking about us then yeah that's right look he said the spirit left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he had to die a man yes sir yes sir die God so what Spirit left him yes the spirit of his 3 and 1 half year Ministry amen where they could not kill him they tried to throw him off a cliff they tried to Stone him they did everything in the world they could to try to kill him trap him trap him in his own words trap him in the scripture they tried for 3 and 1/2 years you think you got [Music] issue they hated it they hated him so much they put you on the cross yet they hated him so much they hung you on the cross that's right remember they didn't hang him for the good works he did no sir that's right they hung him for saying he was gone amen they hang believe so the spirit left him in the Garden of Gethsemane and to die man remember friends he didn't have to that was God God anointed that flesh which was human flesh if he went up there as God he' have never died that kind of death can't kill God that's right but he didn't have to but remember he went there with you in him amen thank all his kids bottled up and encapsulated in that flesh couldn't get out but on that cross cross when he died amen that's stand fre you know the Bible tells us that your names are engraved where in the palm of his hand brother Joel when they drove that nail through that pal yes sir it went through my name you can say it went through yours if you want to but it went through mine I make it personal I'm the one that put him up there I'm the one that hung him up there so he put that na they put that right through my name but remember he went there with you and him God never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon that body of Christ we saw both male and female amen all redeemed in that one body they are one same word the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride yes amen so remember Pentecost was a birth then an anointing came the book was closed there was a 3 and 1 half year Ministry to come brother brand comes and and I I just believe that when he went in Arizona over there and the cloud that they hate so much for I'm glad they hate it that's okay I'm glad they hate it I love it that cloud is a symbol to me that Christ came back down with an open book yes gave it to the prophet Prophet delivered it do he did not take it with him he give it to me and you thank God Amen so that 3 and 1/2 years Ministry he could not die right but he was rejected The Headstone was rejected that's right amen Luke 173 say even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is to be R amen final Voice final age final anointing for the Gentiles you're ready amen you're ready rde we yes this is the anointing we've been looking for don't tell me it looks bad it looks good looks good you still fight you still fuss there's going to be a time when everything's going to come together cuz listen Jesus never had an argument with his own self amen that's right never Jesus never had an argument with the father he said I only do that well he was stand there no I'm not going to do that yes same way with us I'm not going to church today yes you are not going to that church well yes you are cuz there's people over there there Believers everybody with me Lord love you guys appreciate you that anointing is here though yes it's for us reach and grab a hold of sir and just let brother Jackie let it smear all over oh just let that oil

and realize you're bride you have a promise brother Ronnie you got an anointing on you you think well I'm just about Dead's door that' be him talking by De door no you're not there's something working something keeps holding me yes what a what a song to go with that amen something keeps holding me I can't hold myself like sister Linda though she's not holding to herself she's holding to God's unchanging hand she's holding to God's promise that's what you got to do quit leaning on like brother L said quit leaning on a man and quit leaning on on on names and name dropping and all let's throw up one name the Lord Jesus amen he's Supreme he's the authority but he is in you he's not up there somewhere he's right here your glorified body is being built right here you ain't got to go get it where you not going to get it to right here it's it's it's being built by the word that's being anointed right now right now the power of transformation read that book or listen to that day God's power to transform cuz you know what we can't do it we put on hair color we put on like d said you just paint for old Le that's s song I want God to change me I don't want man to change I want God to

for your backside so don't be retreated let's sing a song God bless [Music] you we know we are for the original the original what is the seed the seed is the word of God that's what we come to [Music] realize looking at looking [Music] at [Music] our [Music] amen how we thank God for his precious word word that word that we have become the word made flesh we certainly thank you brother we're not going to try to preach behind you it's the same word the same Holy Ghost yes sir same Holy Ghost yes sir when we see these things that were spoken today and have watched the word grow in our lives not religion right buddy not some looking at some personality but the word grow and that word as we see have come to the Capstone we've been speaking on the Perfection of the bride and as let me just quote this because I love it in the in the message there invisible Union of the Bride brother Brown said that same Holy Ghost the quickening power that Jesus was all the quickening power right he said that same quickening power that raised up Jesus when he raised up Jesus he had all already raised you up with him and SE and seated you in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so we're only catching up to what he has already made us in Christ we are the sons and daughters of God we're thankful for that let's give the [Applause] Lord take your seats for just a moment don't worry I'm not going to stop start preaching but I I tell tell you what that's what we want to leave with that word resonating in our heart with who you are especially in this hour s has so marred the identification of people they don't know who they are what they are why they're here what they purpose and our precious brother speaking on that Anointed with purpose how thankful we are that the purpose of God for knowledge of God that operates in our lives bringing us to a reality that we're not two brother Brown said they'll makeing two every time but it's Christ in you the hope of so brother way we appreciate that brother way really surrendering to the Lord and speaking those great words of truth these words that's transforming us into his image that we're not looking for another person or another man but the word the Christ that's in you the Apostle Paul speaking to the Hebrews he tried to get them to see the great Perfection that moved from Judaism and he talked about Jesus Christ he said how Moses built his house and Christ built his house whose house will you but then he goes on to the ministry of MDC and he begins to talk about the Perfection of who you are and so when we see as brother way Minister today showing us the great anointing that came upon the Lord it did not come and go it did not come and go the brother opened our eyes to the different anointings the Old Testament anointing the false anointing but the anointed bride in this hour that you are that's not coming and going that's not flipping the switch on and off that's not son and daughter of God one day a we're thankful we've recognize who we are and we're thankful that this day this scripture is fulfilled what a wonderful what a wonderful three days the Lord has given all of us and once again we want to thank you all from coming up from Georgia from Lula and and brother Samuel Dale our wonderful Pastor there we want to thank him and and his lovely wife for making the that sacrifice and trip to come up and all of you coming up and just seeing the smiles on your face the fellowship and with your brothers and sisters and we appreciate that so much the group here I can't say enough for sister K Peterson I tell you what she's just 247 working there with her husband back there and just working to get all these things together I told my wife I said uh we're going to have to pay for them a vacation to go somewhere for a long time don't even answer the phone if you don't have to right but I I we thank this lovely group here in Irwin you're so special how everybody was so excited brother not just talking about the meetings but we've been praying for weeks and months for this time and so we don't want to let this like water off of ducks back we're going to hold to that word brother Joel Brown came and poured out his soul last night encouraged all of us spoke to all of us and we heard that word even we have some I wouldn't dare mention that went home families that went home last night and pray for their parents pray for these Mee and pray for brother W they told me we're praying for brother way I thought what care to this lovely family family is and I I thank God that's the kind of caliber we have with these Believers here in and so when we see that and seeing uh pres Brother Louis and his wonderful Ministry and the family that he has brother Aaron here brother Bob went back last night the brother uh way these wonderful ministers have come up and been a great blessing to the church here you know oh with open arms and the Believers are so they're feeding you know as a as a minister when you see your people feeding on the word and and not not just a bunch of nonsense but really feeding on the substance and when we have these kind of Ministries that y'all have sent up it's just been a fair and fair uh you know it's the hand of God let me say this real quick and then then we'll uh compare to to Le and those things I I you know you you as a minister and as a Believer you you you watch the hand of God in your life you watch that and then just however God deals with you been a Christian about 30 years and for me to just wake up to I don't know how God deals I don't know please come on I mean I know something about being a Christian you know it's a shame like he said this morning it's a shame when we come to church and we don't grow in the word it's a shame when we've been reading from second Peter 3:18 where Peter says grow in the grace and the knowledge as Jesus did and so when we're coming to church but we're you know two months later we had learned we hadn't received when Jesus said come unto me and learn me that's his word come unto me and learn him and so you know just like you brother way just like you ministers we challenge these Believers because this is who they are this is what they are this is purpose and anointing and so you know when when we saw the Lord begin to move and when brother Aaron coming up the in his and then brother Bob and brother Lis and then I began to watch because I don't just have anyone come up to this pool I begin to watch that and I thought Lord are you doing something not just having another minister in we love those things we love those things God has a fold Ministry and so I began to see the hand of the Lord move and so when brother Bob and Brother Joseph was here the last time I stood behind his pool pit we had a wonderful time of Fellowship the word went forth might and I said you know you all will you'll have to go and bring your young people and bring the people up from Lou and we and so you know I I I wasn't catching the vision I wasn't catching yet what God was doing and the brothers came through Brother Lou different ones came came through and then so many weeks later I was speaking with brother Wade and he said hey you know let's be praying about this then I I realized that the vision that brother Wade had he' actually had outreached me because I was looking for this too but his vision outreached me when he said we'll bring the group I thought right then oh God this is your do my vision I thought them just here brother W's Vision it Outreach mine God bringing these things together and so how thankful we are it's not about a man as brother B said in the weeks to the seals this hasn't been a man it's God this hasn't been a man you can say what you want you but be careful what you say there hasn't been a man that's been God so all of your lives your families your children your participation has been precious and these things have been in the fellowship of Brotherly kindness and the adap love God and so we appreciate them I'm not good at these things but we going ask brother Wayne to come back and uh or brother come here and what we're going to do we're going to he's going to say a few words and this this and we'll get together we'll head up to the farmers uh Farmers daughter's restaurant this about 30 40 minutes from here they're expecting you all to come we're going to have Fellowship lots of good food nothing like the spiritual food that we had today though and we thank the Lord for that so we love you all so much and so dear I have to do this every time brother because I love Brother Joseph Canada he's bu friend of mine I love him and we've been through so much and then my wife was talking about him last night and Brother Joseph God bless [Applause] you am amen praise the Lord Jesus we don't want to just you know elongate the time even further we just thank God for his word and appreciate each and every one of you amen coming to see him amen the word amen so hopefully that word takes effect in your life amen and you continue moving on with that word praise God Amen so uh we just appreciate brother Andre once again he's just been a blessing to me personally I know to many of you all amen just is like like brother white said he's he's just a humble meat person and one of the things that I always brag about brother Andre is that whenever you're talking with him he always make you feel important you don't care what he has to say he wants to know what you have to say and that's what I've always appreciated about that Andre you know so U so I'll keep saying that brother Andre cuz I I like that quality bless you it makes you feel amen so let's just bow our heads amen our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity that we had to have heard your word Lord Jesus we can truly say Lord God that it's been good father to be in the house of God lord to worship with these Believers father of like Precious Faith Lord and Lord we ask Lord that you would just uh continue to bless brother Andre Lord as he labors father here and in the church and the people Lord that that that work alongside him Lord may
