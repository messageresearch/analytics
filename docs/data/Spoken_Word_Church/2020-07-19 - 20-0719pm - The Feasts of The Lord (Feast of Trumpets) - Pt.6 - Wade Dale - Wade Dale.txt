ambidextrous well i'm really not but i was at that moment so good to be in the house with the lord by way of announcements let's get those done real quick but listen to them yeah wednesday i announced these people were going to go back to phase one phase one is just the men in the building and i read off the names i'm going to read them one more time brother dale myself brother terrence brother anderson brother john duret brother josh bro tony butler kern brother bob bob's feeling really good he's good and brother luis is feeling good um brother paul will be here wednesday with us one more time before he take goes back to that forsaken place called mini soda hey man brother donny brother ryan brother gary brother danny and the new brother all right so we will have those until you hear anything different that will be wednesday and sunday at least until we kind of shake all this out of the out of the building so it'll just be the brothers and sister esther can play the piano she sit with tony that's okay so it's all right but um also remember next sunday dad and i will be leaving right after service going to illinois for a couple days working on the deer land so just keep us in your prayers that way we'll be back on tuesday so um and then right after the service we're going to a death a burial and a resurrection amen the old man's gonna die and there's a new man gonna come to life so we'll be able to see how that god does it god does it really nice death burial resurrection right there in one one instant and thank god that we see that some are walking in newness of life and some are are carrying on i was if you go back to my old when we were preaching on a revival always after a plague there's a revival so i think this plague that we're seeing now that we're really going to see and and i i know some are at brother dale and i were talking another day some are having a revival but i told you it was not a church revival it's a personal revival so it's a personal revival it will never be another brother brown said it'll never be a worldwide sweeping revival it'll never be a revival that'll catch attention the third poll is not for the world it's not for you understand what i'm saying it's not a public show but we can have a revival in our hearts every day how that god i you know you get up in the morning and you you just thank god that you did something that probably hundreds of thousands of people were not going to be able to do that day because that many people die every every day around the world and they didn't get up like you did but you did you got to get up you got to breathe breath and you got to then turn that to praise him for letting that happen so we're on the feast of the lord and today is part six which would be feast of trumpets now i want you to understand something before we get started there's a difference in the feast of trumpets and the seven trumpets in the book of revelations but they do compare together and i'll show it to you in just a little while so everybody got that say amen so we're gonna talk brother brown preached on the feast of trumpets remember the um he he tried for months to get a building to preach on on the the seven trumpets and the seven trumpets and the seven trumpets and he was pushing pushing puss and pushing because he saw him in there he saw him in the bible plagues vials and all that and then god just kind of shut the door and if you're a minister if you've ever studied anything you sometimes you have to go by the leading of the lord sometimes you you know you get up against that wall and you don't go any further and god wants you to go a different direction so then he revealed to brother adam when he preached the feast of the trumpets which is what we're going to talk about today that he had already preached seven trumpets in the seals so he had already preached them supernaturally so what we're looking at today all these feast days they're natural happenings but to me and you it we're still on the journey of a christian right this is your journey of going from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost and then growing further in justification sanctification in the baptism of the holy ghost as you go up the pyramid and further on up to the headstone you go through the justification sanctification in a higher order but we'll stay right down here on the bottom if you don't mind for today so leviticus 23 verse 23 let's remember all these that are sick mom with sinus infection and and all the different ones i talk i call bob and and louise between services and they're okay um they're getting on the side of uh bob said he was a little bit tired yesterday i told him that's just cause he's getting old so i can't blame that on a virus so leviticus 23 but just remember these that are that are sick and going through the going through just just daily sicknesses you know uh being cooped inside and all these things that we're and you know what fear brings on a lot of things so so let's just be careful that um that we do not let that happen all right let's bow our heads daily father we thank you for this day that you give us we pray that lord you would be the one that does the speaking you be the one that does the revealing because lord we can't do that only you but you said you would send the holy ghost in your name and that you would teach us and show us things to come so father we pray that you would reveal yourself to us today be with us lord again as we say lord the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us ones are at home that we've had to depart again for a little while lord and uh and just take a little bit of time like we did before and we pray lord that you would keep us and protect us the devil wants to destroy us we're the last thing on the earth that he wants to see on the earth he does not want us to be here but lord you promised we would and you promised we would persevere and you promised we would overcome to he that overcometh will i give all things and that's us lord i pray that you would be with us and take care of us in the furthem of this service bless the missionaries on the foreign fields lord give them the fruit for the labor be with the ministers around the world we know that satan's trying his best to attack the ministry even in their physical bodies and we pray lord protection for that lord that you would be with us and take care of us lord lead us and guide us by your holy spirit today in jesus name we pray amen amen all right leviticus 23 verse 23 the lord spake unto moses saying speaking to the children of israel in the seventh month now remember we when we started in the other feast which we're going to go through the feast of passover and unleavened bread first fruit and pentecost is in the spring now we've went through several months now and it's going to be the seventh month not the first month because remember the first month of the jewish christian their christian or religious calendar is what apr is march april all right that's their first first day of the month now this october or the seventh month is going to be their beginning of their civil calendar and if you'll notice even in uh brother john knows that some people have a july the first fiscal year some have an october fiscal year like governments do a lot of october fiscal years and we used to do it when uh when we had a business there uh we'd do it then so there's several m this one then is the jewish first month of the civil calendar but the seventh month according to the bible the seventh month in the first day of the month shall you have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets and holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word now we have been over this and i hope that it it's just not a jewish thing it's for it's for each one of us it's for each one of us to take and know that when we go through these things that's what i've been trying to get to you with the with the believers and the journey of a believer when somebody in the bible did something ruth boaz and all these different uh characters in the bible they were doing that as an example for me and you remember i read in the bible that these were given for examples to whom the ends of the world have come upon so they're our examples they were physical people but they didn't know i don't think at the time that when they were going through these things that brother john they'd say well no in 2020 no no they didn't know that they were living their life out and these things were happening according to the foreknowledge of god i don't know if y'all ever heard the foreknowledge of okay all right yeah that's good but by the foreknowledge of god he's seen all this happen and could write it in the bible write about a ruth and the boaz and i'm reading in job now and uh and reading about his three best friends yeah they they were uh accusers of the brethren i think they were trying to get job to confess things surely job you did something yeah but see that's how people are but see you see that the same way now uh it's like brother dale was saying this morning you know well that guy's just serpent seed he don't believe like i do well you better be careful touch not mine anointed you would have thought saul would have been serpent seed if we was looking at what saul did i'm talking about big saul the king but he'll be there amen he'll be right there with us he won't be bribed but we know what he'll be he'll be there with the old testament because david said hey touch not mine anointing do my profits no harm and so we just need to be careful and let god do the judging um except us so all right let's look now let's start with passover real quick we're going to go through these because we've been through them before but we need to get them together passover is leviticus 23 verse one and i think brother kearn's back there trying to help with anderson so uh if it's a little bit slow it's okay it's all right we gotta we're an hour early oh boy now we and the lord speaking of people get all nervous when you talk about tithing now and and time getting in here and anyway speaking of the children of israel and say unto them concerning the feast of the lord which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feasts so god set these feasts up himself he didn't set them up for and he set them up for herself for them to what worship him six days shall work be done but on the seventh day is the sabbath of rest and holy convocation you shall do no work therein it is the sabbath of the lord and all your dwelling so there's your saturday remember what sunday the first day of the week amen but they took sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and saturday was their sabbath and sabbath or sabbath means to rest all right so every seven days they had a rest day that didn't include the feast the feasts came in a little bit later all right these are the feasts of the lord and even holy convocations which you shall proclaim in their seasons thereby understand those seasons same way with me and you you come in in your season he that our brother didn't come in last week i mean last year last two years he came in in the season you and i all came in the season that was ripe that the fruit was right for god to harvest everybody got that amen all right so even holy convocations which you shall proclaim in their seasons in the 14th day of the first month what's the first month abib or nissan are march april and the 14th day of the first month at evening is the lord's passover and we saw what you were supposed to do you take the lamb of the first year and it was supposed to be without blemish typing who jesus christ he was the passover lamb he was the one that was going to die but remember that was a temporary blood that they put over the doorpost in egypt when the next rain came just washed it all away but the blood of jesus christ it had it had god involved in it not just an animal blood this was god involved all right so when he shed his blood it's like i love what the prophet said he said there's a little thin red bloodline all the way around the earth that covers the earth where god can hear our voice through that blood if he didn't hear a voice through the blood like the same way with adam and eve like brother dale's talking about they would have died you and i would die we're still sinners saved by grace and the thoughts and the ideas and the things that we do are contrary to god amen so i thank god that that covering is still there you say no i don't need it well yeah you need it every day every day we need that covering every single day just to make it through the day because we do have sins all right we do have unbelief sorry we do just admit it if you admit these things that's why when somebody comes to comes to the lord you just admit you're wrong right i admit i was wrong i and we all every one of us sometimes and you know you do you you feel like maybe you're on an island somewhere that i'm the only one that has did a sin and had a past life and i'm the only one that you know no no brother no no every one of us every one of us even the prophet of god wherever we got the holy ghost either slop jar or pen or or on the railroad track or wherever he was he had an experience where he came and said god i'm tired i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired amen so we all come to that there's none of us ever just walked up and said well i believe this ever since i was like five years old no you're a liar so you need to you need to get that lying spirit off of you first amen so that's why the bible says repent and be baptized that's the problem sometimes we don't get that repent part right we just want to get them to the water well we want to get them repented first amen get them to repent and know that you did the wrong know that we did what we did so but we have a covering amen we have a covering and that covering speaks all down through your life even as we were talking the other day you know brother brown says that we all that believers have angels and and you were born with an angel to protect you why because you were predestinated but by foreknowledge you were predestinated to become a christian i mean you got to get to that brother they will get to that where it is where god did see you come to a place and if he saw you come to that place he can't do anything else but bring it to you at that place amen but it was my foreknowledge that he knew you would want it more than life itself if you ever want this gospel if you ever want the new birth more than life itself god will give it to you amen but if you say well i can't because see there you go into the situation i can't no god can save anybody that wants to that wants to be saved right amen he said well i was pretty well you're predestined to think that too okay so we we we see by foreknowledge that this is what god the children of israel they needed a prophet for instruction an angel to guide them because they didn't know they were going on a 40-year journey god did that's right god knew they were going on a 40-year journey they didn't know that they were just a few days from the promised land but god gave them an angel to guide them pillow fire and a cloud and then he gave them right from the get-go just like before they even sinned one time in the wilderness god give them a lamb give them a blood covering just like he gave adam and eve a blood covering before there was even the foundation of the world he knew he was going to have to come down here and die and shed his blood right so he went ahead in his mind and said okay i'm going to have this plan of redemption and even the children of israel are included in that plan of redemption because they're for our example and then that same children of israel you said same well the the progeny of that children of israel is going to be 144 000 is going to be saved after you and i leave this place so god's not going to forget israel looks like sometimes he did no he's not going to forget israel never will forget israel he said no i ca how can i do that so he's not going to forget her no he's coming together even though they're the ones that put him on the cross physically you and i put him on the cross but physically they said you know let his blood be on us and our children but god's going to take care of them he knows that most of them are not going to make it but they're going to give him a prophet anyway give them a prophet going to give them an angel going to give them a lamb to cover their sins same thing with me and you he's going to give us those three things on our journey and then we see that the next is unleavened bread it says on the 15th day of the same month so it's the next day after the same month on the same month the next day is the feast of unleavened bread seven days you must eat unleavened bread and the first day you'll have a holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord seven days and then the seventh day is a holy convocation you should do no servile work there in now we know that that types the seven church ages i'm just trying to get everybody up speed that types of seven church ages that the first church age was a holy convocation and the last church ages are holy convocation so we've got the holy what we've got to do is is the prophet of god turned us back to the faith of the fathers not to something different but back to the faith of the fathers so then he could really come on guys what kind of journey would we have without the prophet here today what would you be come on where would you be without hearing of this message whether you just heard of it or whether you've been in it since you was a kid what would you be doing yeah you're going to do you're going to go to the methodist and you're going to go to the baptist i can't i can't understand how that you can be exposed to this message and then go somewhere else i just can't see that all right but you know why i can't see that because i believe god's filled me with the holy ghost and if he filled you with the holy ghost you'd have the same faith you can't go back you can't go back listen there's nothing to go back to once you've got the real thing there's nothing there's no substitute to go back to but now a lot of us had to go through those substitutes baptist methods pentecost and and lutheran yeah brother paul's daddy was a lutheran preacher so he grew up lutheran all of his life he bang bang bang yeah i know button heads but he was a lutheran during his life and so he knew about martin luther good guy yeah good guy super guy church age messenger but remember he knows that same way as brother dale knows the baptist faith and then how can you look back to that faith and get anything from it i'm bringing a point to this because how in the world now some of those that were in their journey in the world in the wilderness of sin wanted to go back to egypt but they never got a true revelation so god just let them die but now joshua and caleb never said i think we need to go back no caleb saw a mountain one day and he said that's my mountain and it's not back in egypt it's over in the promised land and i'm going in that direction and and joshua even went into the promised land caleb went into the promised land and came out so same way with you and i you and i are going to go through these feasts during our time of being a christian unleavened bread is what no leaven no added interpretation no added interpretation because leaven is an addition even air is 11. because if you need dough nick k-n-e-a-d not need if you need no need dough and you don't do something with it in 18 minutes it begins to rise anyway because air causes the bubbles and the chemical reaction and all that that's why he told them to eat their food in haste and if it was going to be unleavened bread and they ate unleavened bread until the manna fell why they were moving they were patting that bread as fast as they could they were feeding two million people they were patting that bread and sticking it in the oven as fast as they could will it come out like this god said you're going to eat unleavened bread a feast of unleavened bread seven days so during seven church ages even lutheran today like brother brown said i saw him where he was talking about wesley would turn over in his grave if he saw what happened after his message came but now when when martin luther came on the earth he was a messenger for that day he was the truth for that day but now you can't stay in lutheran now and make it you got to keep moving on same way with them you you say well i'm just going to do unleavened bread and i'm going to quit no god required these feasts to be done in order in their season and so he requires me and you to do the same identical thing no leaven among you brother brown says brings the headstone what no false doctrine okay because 11 of the pharisees was their false doctrine but when we get into the feast of pentecost you're going to see god use not unbelief leaven but this is leaven i hope you saw that last sunday uh some of them some real good comments and i i'm going to try to touch on a little bit more than what i did last week on on the feast of pentecost because that's where you bring lebanon and you go what in the world you bring lebanon because in in the feast of unleavened bread that very first day you went through your house you crawled underneath the the furniture you went through all the cabinets because if there was leaven found a little bit further down home if you find i tried to shorten this a little bit but if they found leaven in your house you was cut off from israel you was cut off you couldn't come to no feast you couldn't do anything but if you do this you are offering it to the lord and the first day you'll have a holy convocation and the last day you'll have a holy convocation so we had to get back to the first church age and the way they acted book of acts the way they acted before we could move on so let's go now to exodus 12 it says right here seven days shall you eat unleavened bread even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses now they had to do it in a physical house you and i have to do it in what house this house right here this is the house we're talking about right here not a physical house because it wouldn't do you any good to go home and say june we got to get rid of all the baking soda and powder and all we got to get rid of all this stuff huh i just i just wouldn't eat there for a while we i i need a bun a bun not a bun i need a bun to eat my hamburger with there you go hey hey man but in this house when you come to church when you press play when you listen to the prophet when you listen to the brothers when you're standing talking what's happened is you're searching for unleavened bread in your house and when you come to a place new brother you come to a place and you say i i don't know about that get it out because you don't want the devil to have place you want to get out you out like the bible tells us he tells us there in luke it says when the unclean spirit goes out now some of us we don't want him to go out too far we just we just wa brother john come on some of us are going now wait a minute i think maybe um i'll just keep no out out unclean spirit goes out of a man i want that thing to walk in dry place i wanted to die because the unclean spirit goes out walks in dry places i wanted to die so that's what's happening in type of because god knew israel could not keep this as me and you keep it to get it out of this house they had nothing to get it out of their their house this house so god said hey physically go into your house and look for leaven any addition get it out for seven days and that was a question where did this lev now remember they use leaven all the time everybody got that they had 11 in the house it was just these seven days they were required to get it out then after the seventh day they could bring it back in and bake because they wanted to bake you know their loaves and all that stuff kind of like us hamburgers i want to eat a cheeseburger with mozza on it i don't want no little cracker on my on my cheeseburger you want cockroach cheeseburger no i'll eat crackers with other stuff but not on my cheeseburger i want some leaven some something to eat but we'll see that when we get to the two loath for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day into the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel so listen anybody in the church age that took in unleavened bread or our false doctrine they were cut off they were cut off because born-again believers even luther's born-again place in in the in the body of christ it was pure when he said the just shall live by faith that was unleavened bread that was unleavened bread just as much as we say father son holy ghost is not a baptism lord jesus christ is the baptism amen but in luther's time that's all he knew in his seven days though god will put a bride in heaven just by the just shall live by faith because that is unleavened everything else that they've packed into it is living the parts that you do this with that's the that's the leaven part all right so now let's go to the next one first fruits and the lord speak unto moses saying speaking to the children of israel and saying to them when you be coming to the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the lord to be accepted what for you so as i've been talking i want us to understand that brother branham he spent a lot of time talking about headship right that's why he was talking about the girl the ladies should not cut their hair because that's what the bible says it's not because what the prophet said the bible said you shouldn't cut your hair amen and it's a shame and you dishonor your headship come on same way with us our headship is christ ladies don't think that we and i've heard for years preachers beating on women trying to get the women lined up when they needed a lot of it their self amen they needed a lot of lining up theirself because you know what we're all feminists when that man right there looks at us we're all feminist in the body of christ when that man looks at me i'm a bride i'm not a groom that's right i'm a bride so all of us are feminists in the body of christ but because we came down here in flesh and because what eve did in the garden there had to be headship of god or christ the man and the woman a woman can't teach or preach and all these different things and brother brown told us on the um tape the other day about man being the head of the household all right now he's not to be a slave driver but there is headship right there is headship all the way down and it's got to stay that way or you're out of the will of god so here we are we see that what you had to see what am i talking about brother donnie had this field of grain of barley and he jumps out there and grabs the first i'm going to try to stay here because he's brother kern you i told him i tried to stay still but here brother donnie goes out and says well bless god the preacher ain't nowhere around and i really don't need him anyway sorry i'm using you for this i don't need him anyway i'll just go out there and pick the biggest one the first fruits and i'll bring it in and i'll wave it before the lord now you remember two times in the bible aaron's two boys offered strange fire right and they died somebody jumped in and was going to do something make an offering with a shoe bread maybe hezekiah or one of them he turned leprous see you don't go there is a way to approach god so the way to approach god is is donnie says okay i have a high priest and god speaks to me through him right real simple yes amen you know what it takes a lot off for you sisters an awful lot of you brothers that you say well i don't have to preach amen please but donny realizes that so he brings his first fruit to the priest and the priest waves it to be accepted for you that's why christ was the first fruit that's why christ was the first sheep christ was the first wave because what we are accepted in him are chosen in him amen because that wheat came out of the same field that all that other wheat or barley that's fixing to be harvested it was brothers to that but you had to go a certain way that's why we come to church that's why we listen to ministers and while we we have a brother branham on tape and then we have the bible and all these things but he shall wave the sheaf before the lord to be accepted for you on the moral after the sabbath the priest shall wave it and you shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf as in helam without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the lord and the meat offering there shall be two tents deal a fine flour mingled with oil an offering made by fire unto the lord for a sweet savior remember there's three times you do this but we'll not get into that and the drink offering there shall be of wine the fourth part of the hymn and you shall eat neither bread nor parts corn nor green ears until the self same day that you have brought an offering unto your god so like i said before brother donnie couldn't say well i i'm not worried i'm not going to worry about what the preacher says i'm just going to go in here and bake my i'm going to have my own you couldn't even eat if you read even the commentaries you couldn't you could not even harvest that field couldn't touch it until that priest offered it why because of headship you and i we're going to try to save ourselves no we let what jesus christ die for us the only one that could die and come back and then come back into me and you so we we we let him do his job same way with boaz ruth could not do the redeeming she had no inheritance she was she it was naomi's inheritance right but but boaz said today i'll go do it i'll redeem and that's what was happening here the whole field was being redeemed or able to be used able to be used by god when you do it the right way and you shall eat neither bread and a parts corn or green ears until the self same day that you have brought an offering unto your god it shall be a statute see you weren't offering it to the priest you're offering it to god right all right it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations and all your dwellings so now let's look at first corinthians what paul said about it if if in this life only we have hope in christ where of all the men most miserable but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept he had to be the first one up for since by man came death by man also came to resurrection what man came to death by who adam first first adam but by the second adam came the resurrection of the dead listen adam couldn't die for you adam was given rulership but he couldn't die for you he died but his life is somewhere in another dimension christ had to come the second adam and look it never says and evil die it says in adam aldo yeah hmm so even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order you came one year you came 10 years ago you came 20 years ago you came 30 years ago you came now but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits in other words he had to do it first afterwards they that are christ at his coming and remember that was a barley harvest that we're talking about in first fruits that was a barley harvest not a wheat harvest wheat harvest comes on the day of pentecost barley harvest was a cheap grain or or a little bit less expensive grain but it was very important because it was the first thing to come up you didn't just leave it out there and say well no i'm going to wait i'm going to wait 50 more days no it would be ruined by then you harvest so christ was the first fruits he was the first one to be harvested amen in the barley harvest and he was the first fruit so now let's bring that chart up just for a second real quick brother anderson thank you so we now we see that this is the first month of the year listen all right this is when the passover started on the 14th day unleavened bread started for seven days after that started on the 15th we just got on the first fruits which is on the morrow after the sabbath what's tomorrow after the sabbath monday sandy it wrote right there but tomorrow after the sabbath then you count that's what we were last sunday you count seven weeks seven sabbaths of weeks seven times seven weeks seven times seven days is 49 days and then on the 50th day you had a feast of weeks or a feast of pentecost which penta means 50. all right so let's go to that one now real quick so there's you hold it right there stop go back this is your spring feast everybody got that same man because it's going to be important a little bit later this is your spring feast christ himself was the passover lamb he was his body was laying in the grave the very next day on the feast of unleavened bread then on the very day after that which was sunday being the first day of the week he rose as the first fruit the first one to come up out of the grave the first sheaf wave and now he's going to he promised them he said i will return in so many days later i'll be coming inside of you so all these four first four feasts christ had something to do with now he's got something to do with all these but these happen when he's not here in his physical form but that's got to happen through somebody amen so that's what we're going to get into the feast of trumpets here in a few minutes and see what's going on so the feast of pentecost i want you to look at the different things we're talking about here let's go to the feast of pentecost now watch leviticus 23 15 says and you shall count unto you from the moral after the sabbath all right from the day that you brought the sheaf wave offering seven sabbaths so the priest was waving the sheaf on sunday when christ was resurrected all right so the moral after the sabbath which was that very day you count 49 days seven sabbaths shall be complete even unto the moral after the seventh sabbath all right so the day after the seventh sabbath would be fifty days everybody got that say amen seven seven is forty nine and fifty all right even until tomorrow after the seventh sabbath shall we you number fifty days penta penta is fifty pentecost and you shall offer a new meat offering until the lord this is something new it's something never been done before this feast of pentecost because what you're going to do you shall bring out of your habitations remember like we're talking last sunday this didn't come out of the tabernacle this didn't come out of out of the priest's office it came it came out of your habitation in other words where you live it came from where you live listen god deals with you what where you live and where do you live oh i live down at 715 herbert no right here is where i live that's right right here and you shall bring out of your habitation two wave loaves of two-tenths deal now something has happened there has been 11 had been added to this to make a loaf everybody got that two loaves of two-tenths deal they shall be a fine flower they shall be bacon with leaven all right so there gotta be some fire added to it with leaven they are the first fruits unto the lord and you shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish the first year one young bullock two realms they shall be for a burnt offering unto the lord with a meat offering their drink offering even an offering made by fire of sweet savoring to the lord then you shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering and two lambs there's a lot of sacrificing being done on this day of penta cost don't you think the 120 on the day of pentecost they sacrificed a lot to be there and the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruit so he picks the two loaves up that you bring he picks the two loaves up and he waves them before the lord everybody got that say amen all right for a wave offering before the lord with the two lambs they shall be be holy to the lord for the priest now watch you see the sheaf wave now turns into a loaf of bread you had to you had to learn this remember this is a wheat harvest this is not a barley harvest this is a wheat harvest right all right you say how can we be more listen the reason you and i are more important than christ oh my lord he can't do this without us but he chose that we didn't he chose he wasn't going to do it because remember he's a father he's going to have children and having children he had to bring us in flesh amen he had to bring the loaves into being he had to know that there was leaving leaven coming and listen watch this god added leaven to itself not false doctrine we're not talking about false doctrine now we're talking about leaven that goes in a to bake a loaf of bread everybody got that in john 1 verse 14 john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word word was god and the word was god spirit god right amen like our brother dale's talking about today but now go down to john 1 14 there was an edition and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us amen now god knew when he put adam and eve in flesh they were going to fall but he used he used that for redemption listen god don't hate that you got flesh on you today hello we might because we're getting older got aches and pains but god never said well now i'm just going to throw them away and start over again no he used that all down through time amen he knew that he was going to come back in your flesh in my flesh on the day of pentecost and start a process of leavening where he's going to enter because look watch this he came spirit to flesh right everybody got that say amen he came spirit to flesh so he came purity now he wasn't impure we know that but his body was not eternal everybody got that gonna be slow right here his body was not eternal he had to come down here and die like me and you so he had to get into the same loaf of bread that you were born in amen because you and i were born leaven and now he's trying to get the leaven out of us that's why brother brown tells us in conjunction and doctrine christ in the bride there's your two lows they both rise christ had to rise first and then we rise with him but we started in flesh and we're headed because watch what did jesus say he said leave the wheat and tares alone we're going back to wheat this is what mom and daddy brought but it's going to be changed because the harvest is not a harvest of a loaf of bread the harvest is a wheat harvest when god says to says hey leave them alone let the angels go through and stick the sickle in and put the wheat in the garner and burn the tares so god had to come down here in leaven so that we can take our living and take it right back to him amen amen so he's he doesn't hate this thing i i told you before this thing doesn't sin it don't sin it's a product of sin that's right amen this thing right here has never sinned a day in its life if you'll see it the way i see it you say no i drank beer no that was you inside that did that because the same guy that same guy that drunk the beer god didn't take your hand off and throw it away and bring a new one no he changed the guy inside and used the same loaf of bread oh come on people he used the same loaf of bread to fulfill his plan and leaven is a raising agent a rising a raised well if it don't excite you then that's okay because you know what jesus didn't say i'm the wheat of life jesus never said i am the barley of life jesus said i am the bread of life so there was something added in there brother john it wasn't that he was this yeah sure we know he the words he spoke was unleavened the words he spoke was pure and unadulterated unleavened bread but he was standing god almighty eternal god standing in human leavened flesh because it was an addition to what he was before but when he came back on the day of pentecost he said hey i was a loaf one time before now i'm going to go into them and i'm going to change them in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound oh we haven't got any of the trumpets yet okay so anyway i am the bread of life you know what he was doing he was standing there saying i am god in human flesh i am god in that loaf and you know what when he came back on the day of pentecost paul should have stood up and said and i mean peter should have stood up and said i am god in human flesh hmm you say that's too close no john 1 14 speaks to me and you speaks to me and you as much as it speaks of jesus christ and the word was made flesh are you not the word now that you're born again you're the word you're the word made flesh it just took your time remember the spirit was made flesh in jesus's part because he was before you and i were not before remember brother dale keeps telling us we were nothing we were not spirits we weren't we had no we had no mind of what we were i mean how many of y'all can i can't remember when i was five well i can't remember a couple days ago sometimes but i but i mean really i mean you can't remember it's just a fog but jesus christ when he came human flesh he said before abraham was i am he said if he if you talk to him you're gonna have to talk to me so what he done he came spirit to flesh to take our flesh change our spirit and then put them together because remember here's the key you can't unless unleavened bread did i say that right okay in other words once you add 11 you can't take it out same way with a with a the pickling process you know you start with a cucumber start with a cucumber and once it's turned into a pickle it can't be turned back into a cucumber so once you get born again you can't be put back into what you were before no you've been changed your change started the day you received the new birth not something that it's just gonna be we're gonna walk into that we're all a bunch of pickles anyway so all right let's go pentecost let's read this commentary that we saw out of the greek lexicon pentecost means the 50th day or harvest feast what am i saying listen god does not have a problem with your leaven when he's talking about this your leaven that he don't like is the one that's the ones that's up here this is your addition to listen you can't undo your flesh how many of you got here because you wanted to get here no you got here because well anyway had nothing to do with it but now once you got here you got something to do with it pentecost means the 50th day or harvest feast or feast of weeks maybe be regarded as a supplement to the passover it lasted for but one day because the next day wouldn't have been the 50th day pretty simple from the 16th of nissan seven weeks were reckoned inclusively and an extra 50th day was the day of pentecost which fell on the sixth of savannah which is somewhere in the end of may the pentecost was the jewish harvest home and the people were especially exhorted to rejoice before jehovah with their families their servants the levites within their gets that pentecost was including everybody listen god would give every person the baptism of a holy ghost on that day if they would have accepted it right but only 120 was promised to go tarry up in jerusalem and stay there until you be endued with power from on high or dunamis from on high all right and then there was 3 000 little jesus is born after that sermon was preached but this is for everybody families it says to what to you and your children and to them that are far off even as many of the lord our god shall call the servants the levites within their gate the stranger the fatherless the widow in the place chosen by god for his name as they brought a freewill offering of their hand to jehovah their god what was the free will offering the 120 in the upper room the free will offering was their self they took their loaf of bread up into the upper room made from the first fruits of the wheat harvest i'm sorry the great feature of the celebration was the presentation of two loaves made from the first fruits of the wheat harvest with the lowe's two lambs were offered as a peace offering and all were waived before before jehovah given to the priest the loaves being leavened could not be offered on the altar the other sacrifices were so in other words it had to come out of your habitation all right and as you keep on going we'll not read the rest of it but down at the bottom it's really nice to know that the interval is still regarded as a religious season the pentecost is the only one of the three great feasts which is not mentioned as a memorial event in the history of the jew but it's so significant that it was on the 50th day that god came down that sound familiar with the sound of a mighty russian wind and went to mount sinai and gave moses the ten commandments for them to live by didn't god come down with the sound of a mighty rushing wind to your mountain and give you the holy ghost to what so you can live by all right and sinai their consecration to him as a nation was complete all right brother brown says let's read these two quotes let's not show from the beginning and what happened was look they left jesus right down here they left jesus at the feast of pentecost now this is a natural happening they all went to jerusalem they took jesus the young 13 year old kid they took jesus with him with them and they went to jerusalem well they headed back to their to their house and they lost jesus and brother brown was telling them showing where they lost him they lost him at the feast of pentecost you can't find them searching through creeds and denominations denominations and creeds all should go back to the beginning now let's go to the next one questions and answers prophet of god said and read oh there was a great time going on now when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one mind and one mind believing that god was going to send that promise and let every person in here get in that same mind tonight and see what takes place it's got to repeat it's a promise just the same as they had so see we don't have a day of pentecost a day on the calendar you and i are gentiles you you don't receive you don't have to wait until the whatever day that was of savant to get the baptism of the holy ghost no you're in a every day it's a promise just the same as they have that any day you can receive the baptism of the holy ghost you don't have to wait till a certain day then we see in the book of acts and we see the promise and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all one mind or all one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared under them cloven tongues like as a fire it set on each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave utterance and there was dwellers in jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation everybody come into this great feast of pentecost and while they were having their great feast and they were presenting the two loaves christ was coming down going into those loaves that were up here in the upper room and he was saying to find listen that's where christianity began right there is when god came down and said i'm only one man and i'm confined in this loaf of bread but when i take it back to the father and i come back in spirit form i'm going to get into all these loaves and i'm going to send you out and we're recipients today we are recipients today of that now when this was noise abroad the multitude tank came together and we're confounded because every man heard them speak in their own language they were all amazed and marveled saying one to the other behold are not these which speak galileans and now here we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born amen so there's the day of pentecost to me it was a very important day but what happens to though is you got to remember from the day of pentecost to the next to the feast of trumpets there's several months in there because you got to go all the way to the seventh month you got to go from like the third month to the seventh month you got to go from the first church age to the last church age of the filling of the holy ghost because there's been a day of pentecost every time somebody gets born again they've been a day of pentecost because he fills you the same as the way he filled them now you may have a different reaction than they did which is fine and dandy that's okay but that's the way they received it and how we hear every man our own tongue we're in we were born now let's go to the feast of trumpets now remember this is the feast of trumpets this is not the trumpets of revelations 8 and 9. everybody got that but it does have something to do with it because pull that chart up just for a second if you don't mind brother anderson boys quick got them spider arms working out there right here is the first four feast the spring feast that we've been in right here now you and i when we accept the passover unleavened bread we're we're now driving out the 11 as far as false doctrine first fruits is what we present ourselves to the lord okay then on the day of pentecost that lord comes in the lord of the harvest comes into our heart okay on the day of pentecost the feast of weeks and we received the baptism of the holy ghost and now look excuse me us not the jews us we're going through the seven church ages we have already have the baptism of the holy ghost right we've already got it the jews don't have it yet everybody got that say amen the 144 thousand are waiting to get this all right and we may stop right here because i don't want to go too long we finish it wednesday night they don't get pentecost yet right they don't receive the holy ghost listen they turned all this down literally they're doing these all right literally over there they're they're having these little dinners and eatings and all that stuff for all these years because if they would have accepted jesus christ right here see we wouldn't had this day we gentiles that's right because they would accepted christ and that'd been it but they didn't they turned him down at the first feast everybody with me all right so they don't yeah sure they're doing it they're eating unleavened bread but they don't i don't say they don't have a clue but why do you think they're still doing this over there they're wanting christ to come their messiah hasn't got here yet they think but the messiah's got here for us all right so we go through this we know that jesus died for our sins we know that we're supposed to get all the false doctrine out of our out of our life and that we give ourself as a first fruit like i said a tithing when you come to church it's not that you pay your tithe which is according to the bible you should but you give your time your tithe of your time all right you're giving the first fruits to the lord and then guess what one day you come to a day of pentecost where that jesus christ that died for you came into your heart and then now we've lived through all these church ages and then now you and i are recipients of this we'll talk about in just a minute or maybe we'll stop right here and get in because the feast of trumpets is what it's a sound the day of atonement is not calling you to kill a lamb again it's calling you to remember that a lamb died for you okay and then brother brown says we are now feasting under the feast of what tabernacles which is the last harvest feast we're not going to go build a booth and go live in it and be holy this is the booth he's wanting to live in and that's what we're living under that we're realizing because what they do i'm getting a little ahead of myself but i want you to see the whole picture they're realizing that they're gonna go build a booth out in their yard and live in it for seven days to show that they journeyed through israel and they didn't have their own house they lived in out in the wilderness you and i we know where the last tabernacle is listen there's going to be a tabernacle built in the millennium brother paul and i were talking about that the millennial temple we won't build it we don't know how to build temples we know how to build castles but we don't know how to build temples so they'll build the temple but now watch this so what's going to happen is is we're going to leave all right we're getting we'll do the feast of trumpets later we'll do it next wednesday because i want you to get this real quick this is what i'm heading to but if i don't tell you now just feels like everything's boring today i don't know we'll see but see the messiah returns and takes us out of the way then what happens to natural israel don't they get the holy ghost don't they have to realize that that passover lamb was the literal jesus christ amen and that they got to get what's going to happen is they're going to get all that orthodox jew out of them i think this is what's going to happen i have an opinion no that's not an opinion god don't have an opinion god's god you either believe his word or you don't then they're going to offer themselves to the lord but watch what happens when they get the holy ghost we'll read it later the trumpet sound see you've got to have a feast of the trumpets they're coming to the feast of trumpets but they don't understand that it's going to be the seven trumpets because remember the seven trumpets is not to us brother brown said he preached him supernaturally under the sixth seal which what is the sixth seal two witnesses revealing israel jesus christ and then they call the plagues down on the earth well what happens right here they don't they don't kill jesus christ again they're not they're waiting on the messiah to come so that he can die for him they're going to realize on this day of atonement he already died for him 2 000 years ago and that's where it in in zechariah or somewhere it says we'll turn and mourn we'll we'll oh we killed our messiah a long time ago that's their day of atonement when you a day of atonement is that you realize something died for you they haven't realized that yet and then what's going to happen they're going to take a rapture the messiah is going to return to them and going to take them in a rapture so see there's your feast but we'll get into each one of them but they're literally going through these feasts and if you look in the commentary it's a natural eating of something they've just made it like a and god forgive me like a buffet you know now the jews get together and and you know if if you and i are jewish we get our families together and we eat a meal under all this they're symbols and all these things that go with it but they just don't know you and i spiritually have went going through every one of these but they're going to have to come to a day where they're going to sit down and realize they've went through all these too god's not forgotten they're gonna make right here they're gonna take a harvest that's the last harvest of the year and it's a fruit harvest you've already been a wheat now your fruit your virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness he's going to harvest your fruit right here and he's going to harvest their fruit same time they're going to realize on this day of atonement they're going to say where did you get those scars and he's going to say drop back over here in the house of my friends and then they're going to what they're going to mourn and separate because you know what they've realized their messiah had come and they didn't know it right and they're mourning that god's going to destroy him but he says no no no i did this for your preservation but i also did this for 2 000 years i was bringing a bride i was bringing the gentiles in i've got her in and she's already in glory and she's safe and now i'm coming back to you and i'm going to give you safety 144 000. we're going to have a feast of trumpets there's going to be seven trumpets that sound all these different plagues but you and i don't see that but they do so let's stand our feet god bless you we'll get to the feast of trumpets because there's more to that several other things to that i just didn't get there fast enough we're slow down here we're inside our nurse all the musicians come on because remember brother brown preached when the trumpet gives an uncertain sound there's a scripture that that we're going to read in ezekiel i'll just read it to him we'll read it again this is how important it is to hear the correct word of god ezekiel 33 verse 2 says son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coast and set him for their watchmen watch if then he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away the blood will be upon his own head but but he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul but if the watchmen see the sword come and blow not the trumpet what are you saying brother wade you better be listening to the right word because there's a watchman that's been given and if he blows the trumpet and said the enemy's coming or the enemy is here or we need to quit doing this and we need to quit doing it and we don't heed that then the blood's on us not on the watchmen so we'll read that wednesday night we'll still be on the feast of trumpets god bless you love you with the love of the lord just remember wednesday and sunday it will be these uh men only and sister esther playing the piano so be diligent um like i said brother bob brother luis they're feeling a whole lot better and uh we'll keep up with them um sister adam and brother al but uh god bless you just be diligent just be diligent be watchful well i said that watchman that god gives you a watchman called the baptism of the holy ghost all right and when you feel that little check you better be careful i do that a lot even on my mail route and you think well this is so simple but you just don't know because see i've got 600 boxes and it's a it's a hard surface and they say the buyers can live so i mean whatever but i wear gloves but you know there's times when i'll i'll literally be sitting there and looking at the box and something say sanitize your hands but it won't do that for another 200 boxes or whatever that but stop sanitize your hands and i'll grab that hand sanitizer no give it a good one and keep on going well god's protecting me so far so but you listen to that still small voice that watchman that god gave you yes because remember you don't want to listen to a trumpet that has an uncertain sound if it gives an uncertain sound what do you do i mean there's there wasn't communications back then like they are now but back then you know the charge was one um node and and retreat was one note and moved to the left was another you could really get your voice out there and what if the guy messed up and was supposed to retreat and he blew the charge trumpet disaster what am i saying you need to know what you're hearing you need to know where you're going you need to know what's going on and you need to listen to that certain sound that that trumpet gives you let's sing a song god bless you for her [Music] is brother david is going for a brain scan on tuesday and we're going to pray that everything will be just fine lord jesus we've seen lord many times these prayer cloths lord go to a certain place or an individual lord and we see lives changed and we see things lord and people's lives change because of it even cancer being taken out of bodies so lord we pray that brother david lord when he goes under to that scan lord that everything will be fine lord and that the doctors will see what's going on lord and know what to do father we believe in doctors but we know that you are the only healer you are the healer the great physician and we pray that you would bless our little brother lord and all will be well in jesus name we pray amen so christ is lord say it one more time oh he is lord he has risen from the dead and [Music] every trump [Music] you know what about a a message brother paul i told him many times before [Music] the bible says every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess in other words whether you want to or not you're going to bow why not do it and know what you're bowing for because there's a lot of people going to bow and they ain't going to be very nice it ain't going to be very nice for them but if you and i will submit ourselves to god kneel down and pray and know that he's your lord there's your headship but i'm telling you you can give me any there's many mighty revelations in this in this message but i can count one and those of you that know what i'm going to say i can count one revelation that i think more than any revelation is that brother paul i don't have to go through tribulation i don't have to stand before the judgment bar i don't have to i'm chosen in him and if he don't have to stand in front of it i don't have to stand in front of it the bible tells us that the book was open there was thrones thrones thrones thrones don't you know the saints will judge the earth how can you stand in judgment and be a judge you can't i've been judged and thank god the prophet of god many many times because there's people listening baptist they don't know about the lutheran but the baptist says look you're going through seven years of tribulation and you're gonna have to go before before the white throne judgment and you're gonna have to do all this you ah brother brown said look how can god send his own bride how can you take your own wife and send her into tribulation no he took on our sin so that our loaf will be just as righteous as his loaf and their stands amen the great righteous judge but look at all the ones behind because you know what people are going to walk up to the white throne and you know what somebody in that throng [Music] god's gonna go did that person back there not tell you about me 50 years ago 100 years ago whenever you were and they're gonna have to say yes so what does the judging not so much here stands the judge but back there stands a judge but you got to remember it can reverse because here comes a man here comes a man that's just a cursed all the days of his life had three or four wives and just a drunk but one day he changed sister esther's tire on the side of the road [Music] oh people talk about having what you got inside of you come on he's going to get ready brother paul to slam the book down go with the goats and he's going to wait just for a second because there's going to be somebody way in the back he's going to say lord lord lord you said he likes you to tell him what he said he said you said that a cup of water would not be forgotten in this world or the world to come she said he changed my tire and helped me now what happened here here stands a sinner that went into the fifth dimension no hope dead never knew anything about jesus christ never made a confession but lester said lord if he hadn't changed my tire i don't know where i'd have been [Music] my child what do you say my child what do you say well lord you told us that the cup of water wouldn't be forgotten in this world or world to come and right before that gavel went down he couldn't go past his word he said because of this because what you've done to the least of my little ones you've done it unto me so i'm going to impart you eternal life you move over here now you're not going to be bride brother but i'm going to let sister esther take about 10 000 years and tell you about me and how she got saved and how she took that eternal life that you get that i gave her and she's imparting it to you and he'll show him the nails he'll say look this is what happened and i did it for her but she's one of my little ones so when you did it to her you did it to me enter in the bible tells enter into the joy of the lord prepared for you before the foundation of the world what a mighty god we serve god bless you listen by our heads listen we're going to go down to brother terrence's he's already left so let's continue on down to the baptismal pool and we'll baptize our brother in the name of the lord jesus christ and have some joy angels are waiting for this moment
