[0:06] thank you praise the Lord amen you're
[0:10] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[0:11] this morning
[0:12] amen praise the Lord
[0:15] well it's it's my uh my lot once again
[0:18] by the grace of the Lord and
[0:20] everybody's back for more so praise the
[0:23] Lord
[0:25] by the grace of the lord we were going
[0:27] to talk about financial Jubilee and
[0:30] talking about conform
[0:33] and um you know certainly as we've been
[0:37] talking about financial Jubilee
[0:39] you know I trust by God's grace that
[0:41] you're making progress you know in your
[0:44] life wherever you are whatever season
[0:45] whatever point you are in your life and
[0:48] um you know often I I want to
[0:51] talk about practical things things
[0:52] literal things you could do but it's
[0:54] very important we understand why you
[0:57] know because you can be motivated you
[0:58] could be charged up and
[1:00] um I got it but if you don't know why
[1:02] it's going to eventually evaporate
[1:07] so it's very important to know why why
[1:08] is this important why is this important
[1:11] even the word of God that we've been
[1:13] hearing for so many years you know why
[1:14] why
[1:15] and hopefully by the grace of the lord
[1:17] we throw some practical things in here
[1:19] as well
[1:20] but let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[1:21] Lord Jesus we thank you this morning
[1:23] Lord once again to together in your name
[1:25] father with your people Lord Jesus we
[1:27] don't take it for granted and we pray
[1:29] Lord God that you just bless this little
[1:31] Sunday school teaching Lord God made it
[1:33] go to the Heart Lord God May produce
[1:35] results Lord Jesus so God in all of our
[1:38] Lives Lord Jesus Lord God may we be able
[1:40] to see it Lord Jesus as a just a map
[1:43] Lord God to help us with the the more
[1:45] precious promises Lord that you have for
[1:47] all of us father we commit this day into
[1:49] your hands bless the entire service Lord
[1:50] Jesus we committed in your hands in
[1:52] Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord
[1:55] we'll go to the next slide
[1:58] so always remember no matter how long
[2:00] they had been in bondage or how long
[2:02] they were supposed to stay there when
[2:04] the Year of Jubilee when the year come
[2:06] of Jubilee when the trumpet sounded
[2:07] every man could go free if he wanted to
[2:11] go free
[2:12] so you can see right there if if it
[2:15] depends on what we want to do if we want
[2:18] to go free if we want these promises
[2:20] then we can we just need to understand
[2:22] we need to understand and we need to
[2:24] have that fight that we talked about we
[2:26] got to have that strength to keep
[2:27] fighting to keep pressing every day it
[2:30] doesn't stop no matter what season of
[2:32] life we're in you continue fighting and
[2:35] learning what God wants us to learn then
[2:37] we can be a good example to those under
[2:39] us that's coming up
[2:41] so continue to fight next slide so when
[2:44] we talk about conform conform it means
[2:46] with the word Khan means with together I
[2:50] mean basically to adopt the form of
[2:52] those around us to be similar or
[2:54] identical to be in agreement or Harmony
[2:58] to be obedient or compliant usually used
[3:02] with to conform to another's wishes
[3:05] to act in accordance with prevailing
[3:07] standards are customs basically it means
[3:10] you go with the flow that's the easy way
[3:13] to say it I'm going with the flow and
[3:15] that's exactly what water does water
[3:17] goes wherever is the easiest passive
[3:20] flows right in it'll fit whatever
[3:23] container whatever mold you decide to
[3:25] put it in it will fit
[3:28] and certainly you know coming up with
[3:29] financial Jubilee with me I mean that's
[3:31] what I did I mean although I was born
[3:33] again God changed my life in 1999 I was
[3:37] born again but with finances I didn't
[3:40] know I just didn't know I wasn't taught
[3:43] I I didn't understand it so I was just
[3:46] going with the flow of the world and I
[3:48] was learning so many things that the
[3:49] world has a lot to teach it in believe
[3:52] me it'll teach you all kind of tricks to
[3:54] the trade and my goodness I thought I
[3:57] was just going with it
[3:59] but truly what I was used to I was just
[4:01] used to the form used to the normal flow
[4:04] of the world what they did you know if
[4:06] they happen to have a little money what
[4:07] they do they spend everything that comes
[4:09] in so I was doing the same thing
[4:11] I was used to thinking that way I was
[4:13] used to applying my life that way you
[4:16] know just like if you think about a
[4:17] slave and that's typically what the
[4:19] world wants us to be with finances to be
[4:21] just slaves to the world just flow with
[4:23] it don't challenge it don't question it
[4:25] hey if you can get a house with a
[4:27] mortgage praise God thank God you got
[4:29] that loan that's what you Lord I got
[4:31] approved praise the Lord no matter what
[4:34] the interest rate is you know that's
[4:35] that's thinking like the world that's
[4:38] what it does I can pay all my bills well
[4:40] have you looked at your bills have you
[4:42] questioned them have you said Lord God
[4:44] is this what you want me to be doing so
[4:47] thinking and challenging that getting
[4:49] out of just the form but I was used to
[4:51] that thinking like a slave
[4:53] of course until his brother Louise
[4:55] brought out until God sent me up
[4:58] amen he set me up and this is why I'm
[5:00] here today because he set me up and I
[5:03] was just going we were happy oh praise
[5:05] God going with it
[5:08] and then God told me no let's go to the
[5:10] next slide
[5:12] the word of God as we talked about
[5:13] conform you can't help but see this
[5:15] scripture and it says and be not
[5:16] conformed to this world but be ye
[5:19] transform by the renewing of your mind
[5:23] that you may prove what is that good and
[5:26] acceptable and perfect will of God so we
[5:30] know conforming just to go with the flow
[5:32] but there is an intense pressure in this
[5:35] day to conform period doesn't matter
[5:38] what age you are it doesn't matter who
[5:40] you are doesn't matter if you're born
[5:41] again there is a pressure to conform
[5:44] it's so strong you have people with
[5:46] intelligent minds they will call black
[5:48] white white black a girl a boy a boy or
[5:52] girl anything that's the pressure such
[5:55] an intense pressure
[5:57] and and that's what we will we will just
[5:59] go with the flow but God is saying we
[6:02] have to be transformed in order to get
[6:05] these principles in order for us to get
[6:07] up that statue of a perfect man we have
[6:08] to be transformed in our minds I mean we
[6:11] have to be changed a different form that
[6:14] picture on the previous slide you saw
[6:16] water there was Water Ice and there was
[6:18] steam so we have to be changed
[6:21] completely in how we're thinking about
[6:23] our finances thinking oh Lord this is
[6:26] just a little map
[6:28] of the greater promises that you have
[6:30] Lord this is where it's a part that I
[6:33] have to do
[6:34] and it's a part that you do Lord you
[6:36] provide my needs but you're asking me to
[6:39] be a steward of this
[6:40] Lord God you have given me these
[6:42] precious promises but it's me I have to
[6:44] be diligent I have to pray and read my
[6:46] Bible every day I have to continue doing
[6:49] that there's a part that you have to
[6:51] play right
[6:52] and as we play that part then you see
[6:54] God start to move you start
[6:56] understanding oh Lord this is what
[6:58] you're doing and the devil is so tricky
[7:01] that's why I have that yes and no
[7:03] because the devil he is like a yes yes
[7:08] seems good and God is like no
[7:14] and that's a shock it's a shock to your
[7:17] system that God will say no
[7:21] no you can't have it no you're not ready
[7:25] for it no you don't need it
[7:29] and the Devil comes along and says well
[7:32] yes you can
[7:34] sure
[7:35] I have a way for you
[7:38] and he's been doing that from the very
[7:40] beginning something as simple as yes and
[7:42] no the Garden of Eden there you go God
[7:45] said no you can't eat of that tree the
[7:48] devil says
[7:49] well you can
[7:51] you can do it you actually can
[7:54] there you go then Cain and Abel
[7:57] you know Cain says hey this is what I
[8:00] want this is what I want to offer
[8:02] say it says can you do it the best you
[8:04] can got to know I'm not accepting that
[8:07] that's like a rejection it's like
[8:09] Brother Louis brought I just let him
[8:11] know why he's he saying no and it's the
[8:13] same thing today you can directly apply
[8:16] that to finances if you don't have the
[8:18] money if you don't have the money and
[8:20] you feel an urge to borrow that is God's
[8:22] way of saying no you're not ready you're
[8:25] not ready for it why don't you have the
[8:27] money because I'm just telling you no
[8:29] you're not ready but the devil's going
[8:31] to come along and says yes you can
[8:33] there's many ways you can do it many
[8:36] ways you can do it
[8:38] you see and we go down that path it's
[8:40] easy and then we start conforming thank
[8:43] the Lord for this loan
[8:45] then you hear brother say that you hear
[8:46] sister say that you're like well I'm
[8:48] gonna go apply for my loan thank the
[8:49] Lord the Lord is good we're conforming
[8:51] in the church everybody is getting it
[8:53] alone we just happy celebrating with our
[8:55] loans conforming just going with it not
[8:58] even thinking about it
[9:00] and that's exactly what was happening in
[9:02] my life just going with the flow just
[9:03] not even thinking about it the devil
[9:05] said yes you can yes you got it
[9:08] Oh my he is something
[9:12] and he's always applied that and no gets
[9:14] really deep
[9:15] no gets really deep I was talking with
[9:18] my wife just driving in you know it gets
[9:21] so deep that it can break your faith if
[9:24] you're not careful
[9:26] you know we have expectations of what we
[9:28] think things should happen things should
[9:30] be this way things should go according
[9:32] to my plan my I remember raising kids
[9:35] and before we had kids and we would see
[9:38] the other couples with their little kids
[9:39] and we're like as soon as we get our
[9:40] kids our kids go listen they're gonna
[9:42] sit still we got this I'm telling you
[9:46] how can they let their kids keep
[9:47] slamming the door we're like what in the
[9:49] world our kids going and I would hold
[9:51] somebody else kidding like see I held
[9:54] him quiet for three minutes I got this
[9:56] I'm telling you when my kids come along
[9:59] my goodness and I you know I man I
[10:03] thought I was good even when they became
[10:04] teenagers I'm like I got we I know if I
[10:07] just talk right they're gonna get it
[10:10] the Lord like uh-uh no I'm gonna keep
[10:13] you on your knees
[10:15] period you know and that's what he does
[10:18] we have expectations who might be your
[10:20] friend who might not be friendly even
[10:22] when we pray we have expectations like
[10:25] Lord You're Gonna heal them you're gonna
[10:27] do it God says no no no no no no no no
[10:29] not this time
[10:32] because he has a plan he has a greater
[10:34] plan he's writing a story he's writing a
[10:36] strip as our brother brought out he's
[10:39] writing a play so he has to say no to
[10:42] his children so we can go along and fit
[10:44] his plan right right so he says no and
[10:48] all we have to do is realize Jess as our
[10:50] brother brought out like Lord you just
[10:52] have something greater for me help me to
[10:55] keep that Faith Lord
[10:57] and in every area he's trying to do that
[11:00] but finances is just an area that he's
[11:02] given us that we can start looking at it
[11:05] he says no to something because you
[11:07] don't have the money that doesn't mean
[11:09] go away disappointed I said Lord all
[11:12] right Lord then you must have something
[11:13] better you must have a better plan Lord
[11:15] help me to stay there and keep walking
[11:17] and you'll see what he does
[11:20] but the devil has done so much to just
[11:22] get us locked in and as we talk about
[11:25] Conformity of course you got the
[11:26] internet it's just loaded with
[11:29] conforming and pressuring us to conform
[11:32] I was reading something about the
[11:34] internet it said you know what happens
[11:36] we get an idea in our minds and all of
[11:39] the social media comes in right and it
[11:41] entrenches you into your very idea it
[11:45] locks you into your idea so it's harder
[11:48] for you to come out
[11:49] just like ice you fit it in and then you
[11:51] freeze it and that's what he's trying to
[11:53] do freeze our thoughts you want this car
[11:56] he'll show you all kind of images of it
[11:57] popping up you search once now you got
[12:00] it every moment here's the same card you
[12:01] know you want it hey next thing you know
[12:03] you're getting an advertisement for a
[12:04] loan everything just oh my God he's just
[12:06] pouring it and he's always done this but
[12:08] now he's just doing it in Greater
[12:10] intensity greater intensity because he
[12:13] wants to entrench us lock us into a
[12:15] certain form
[12:18] go to the next slide as I said you know
[12:21] this was me this was the standard and I
[12:24] I we set out by God's grace I shared a
[12:26] little bit of the testimony last last
[12:27] time how you know we were going to Norm
[12:30] normal going with the flow and um my
[12:32] goodness you know all the money came in
[12:34] I started saying how much house can I
[12:36] get to the Max and uh we got that
[12:39] 40-year loan and uh should have been in
[12:42] bondage just thinking about my brother
[12:44] we the the road that we lived on was
[12:46] called bond avenue and I should have
[12:48] told me something
[12:49] yeah
[12:51] bond avenue yes we were locked in for 40
[12:56] years it was supposed to be that's why
[12:58] Jubilee doesn't matter how long you're
[13:00] supposed to be I was supposed to be in
[13:02] bondage for 40 years but God set me up
[13:06] that business we were doing great the
[13:09] first house we sold my brother and I you
[13:11] know we were just smart you we got ten
[13:13] thousands about ten thousand dollars
[13:15] profit oh man we were like yes praise
[13:18] God I was really imagining Lord you the
[13:21] next one you're gonna bless me I'm gonna
[13:22] be able to pay cash for a car because
[13:24] you're gonna bless me while we were
[13:26] borrowing money we had access to borrow
[13:28] a whole bunch of money for these
[13:30] properties and man I thought Lord this
[13:32] is how you're going to work it out Lord
[13:33] you're so wonderful the Lord said nope
[13:35] no no matter of fact I'm going to sing
[13:38] the entire economy in real estate Just
[13:40] For You John my goodness we started
[13:43] seeing that economy go down my goodness
[13:46] money going out the door my my
[13:49] but we turned around and said Lord you
[13:51] must have something better because Lord
[13:52] I have paid my tithes I have not tried
[13:55] to do anything wrong and I started
[13:57] seeking God and as I sought God we
[14:01] started focusing on we lost ton of money
[14:03] paid it off but as I started learning
[14:06] the principles of God I started
[14:08] questioning what I had done
[14:11] Lord this house I question it paid off
[14:14] all that business debt
[14:17] accepted that challenge paid it off and
[14:19] I started looking at our house and
[14:21] challenging myself like Lord some
[14:22] something's wrong and this is when I
[14:25] started looking at okay man I borrowed
[14:27] two loans for the house we owed about
[14:29] 300 something a thousand but if I just
[14:31] paid that 40 years that's going to cost
[14:32] me eight hundred thousand dollars I did
[14:35] not sign up for that
[14:36] so we challenged that and we started
[14:38] taking God's principles and applying
[14:40] them as we read it in the Bible I mean
[14:43] if we would be up I would just be
[14:44] looking at I started talking to my wife
[14:46] about it like I didn't know these things
[14:49] I didn't know these things I didn't know
[14:51] but Lord God since I had paid off that
[14:55] business loan I started seeing Lord if I
[14:57] just took what you taught me there and I
[15:00] just applied it directly to my house now
[15:03] now when I'm saying apply it that means
[15:05] there's sacrifices there's things that
[15:07] are happening I'm not going with the
[15:09] flow anymore it's hard well man every
[15:12] Sunday we'd be out to eat every I mean
[15:14] this was us you know we would just buy
[15:16] whatever we want to we didn't think
[15:18] about it he said but now I started
[15:20] pausing like hold on wait a second what
[15:22] what's going on
[15:24] and I took the principles of God so
[15:26] we're going to bring out the principles
[15:27] once again let's go to the next slide
[15:29] so I started learning all right God owns
[15:32] it all the 10 tithes are his and the 90
[15:35] okay that's another no if you're not
[15:38] hearing it that means that 90 is not
[15:40] yours to say yes to everything it's no
[15:42] it don't belong to you it's just like
[15:45] your tithes you need to ask God lord
[15:46] what would you have me to do with this
[15:48] father what do you want me to do with it
[15:50] don't go with the world the world and
[15:51] say hey you got 90 especially the
[15:53] younger people leverage that do this do
[15:54] that do this now you better ask God lord
[15:57] what would you have me to do with it
[15:58] manage his resources diligent you have
[16:01] to be diligent you can't just go like
[16:03] water flow with it God has given you
[16:06] money for a reason
[16:08] or Reason
[16:10] you have a job you have assets you have
[16:13] this for a reason you have to manage his
[16:16] resources
[16:17] and it doesn't have to be deep
[16:19] and take anything to start managing his
[16:21] resources start somewhere write it down
[16:24] on a napkin a piece of paper what am I
[16:27] spending every month today is the end of
[16:28] the month right at it you got a whole
[16:30] month of May write down what you think
[16:32] your expenses are
[16:34] what do you think you're going to spend
[16:36] you know you got rent or bills your
[16:38] electric gas you know how much do you
[16:40] think you spend on food write that down
[16:42] that'll give you an idea okay Lord
[16:44] you've given me three thousand dollars
[16:46] to to take care of my myself for this
[16:48] month I know I make four thousand you
[16:52] know okay I do I got my ties and things
[16:54] like that Lord I I really if I do this
[16:56] month at the end of next month I should
[16:58] have 500 dollars
[17:01] that means I got my food I got this I
[17:03] should have 500 left at the end of next
[17:06] month let's see what happens
[17:08] now if you write it down and you're like
[17:10] Lord
[17:12] look like I'm gonna be short
[17:14] two thousand then you might want to
[17:17] pause and say Lord okay let me really
[17:19] think about what's going to happen next
[17:20] month can I cut out something
[17:22] doesn't have to be fancy you're just
[17:24] asking God to help you and he will
[17:26] continue to build on it that's what he's
[17:29] doing he's building on the promises that
[17:31] we have step by step
[17:33] so take that be diligent
[17:35] remember money is still your time you're
[17:38] working if you throw that hour away then
[17:40] it's like you're taking your life for
[17:42] granted
[17:42] you're taking it for granted
[17:44] so it should be worth something to you
[17:48] remember patience we got to learn to
[17:51] wait that is so important learn the way
[17:53] God just has something better he doesn't
[17:55] want you to rush out just because you
[17:57] have it don't mean you rush out to it
[18:00] some of those older ones you're retired
[18:01] you got money you may have more assets
[18:03] through life that means you may have to
[18:05] wait on for your grandchild a little bit
[18:07] longer you know I'm not going to do it
[18:09] right away let me see how this little
[18:10] girl is acting or how this little boy is
[18:12] acting you know is he acting good
[18:16] remember those parents are raising those
[18:18] grandchildren you know they know you
[18:22] know that y'all may be walking around
[18:23] like I get whatever I want Granddad is
[18:24] going to get it for me you know you
[18:27] might need to put a little plug there
[18:28] just give it a little time you know we
[18:31] know it's a season you get to enjoy but
[18:33] remember they're in a season as well and
[18:35] they're in a terrible season with ton of
[18:37] influence and they do live in a society
[18:39] where they think it's all yes oh yes you
[18:43] tell them no they'll say hey there's a
[18:45] way that's just for you daddy that's
[18:47] just for you Mom but there is a yes for
[18:48] me
[18:49] and so we have to make sure we're late
[18:51] we're showing them how to wait because
[18:53] God is going to ask us to wait and God
[18:56] is going to say no why because it's not
[18:59] our plan it's not my plan he has a plan
[19:01] so he's going to say no to them and we
[19:04] don't want his no to cause them to walk
[19:06] away from the faith
[19:08] right amen so that's so important that
[19:10] we help them to understand like no and
[19:13] hold to those no I know it's hard I got
[19:15] kids you know we've been blessed
[19:17] you know we've been really blessed I
[19:19] know it by the grace of the Lord you
[19:21] know but I know God we got to help we
[19:24] can say yes to every single thing that
[19:26] they want and whatever they want we're
[19:27] saying yes yes yes no
[19:29] it's like Lord they got to hear from you
[19:31] if they think that then they're going to
[19:33] feel entitled and the minute God says no
[19:35] to them they're going to say well see
[19:36] the devil got me he has me he's going to
[19:38] take care of me and they're going to go
[19:40] that route
[19:42] next slide
[19:44] the blessings of the Lord that make it
[19:45] the rich and he had his no sorrow to it
[19:47] that is nothing but the truth avoid debt
[19:51] avoid it God wants to bless us he wants
[19:54] to do it but we got to do it in his time
[19:56] and we got to learn to wait he is a good
[19:58] father believe me he will hold to his no
[20:00] he really will and he's going to let you
[20:03] pay the price if you decide to do it
[20:05] that's a good father for you
[20:07] save for the winter remember it's coming
[20:09] save
[20:11] don't spend everything you got that's
[20:13] God saying just because you got it don't
[20:15] mean you give it all out today
[20:17] save a little bit of that look at the
[20:19] ant he's saying no you can't spin it all
[20:21] the best investment is giving giving
[20:24] that some of that he wants you to give
[20:26] we know our tithes but it's also more
[20:28] than that it's giving and of course it's
[20:30] learning contentment that means you
[20:32] start learning how to say know yourself
[20:34] to yourself you start learning how to
[20:37] say no like Lord I'm gonna say no next
[20:40] slide
[20:43] by the grace of the Lord as I said when
[20:44] we paid off that debt
[20:47] and this is just to me I believe this is
[20:49] with no doubt after we paid that debt it
[20:52] was 2016
[20:54] 2015 that's when I you know I got some
[20:57] money I got a little bonus on the job
[20:58] after we paid off that debt and I didn't
[21:00] just buy what I wanted I knew we had
[21:02] that debt so I took that money I threw
[21:04] it on our mortgage and I started getting
[21:06] little chunks out of it like okay thank
[21:08] God
[21:09] and a little bit after that continued
[21:11] did that and 25th 2015 paid a little bit
[21:14] more
[21:15] things started happening at the job they
[21:17] say okay we're going to let you start
[21:18] traveling internationally
[21:20] win overseas
[21:21] well my birthday 2016. a lot more of the
[21:24] house was going I was feeling the
[21:25] momentum they said hey we're closing
[21:27] down to Maryland
[21:29] 2017 when we paid off that house it was
[21:32] five months later this is the truck that
[21:34] pulled up with the eagle on the side
[21:35] that packed us from Maryland to Georgia
[21:37] we were debt free by the grace of the
[21:40] Lord
[21:43] so had I waited for 40 years would I be
[21:46] coming down here in 47 24-7
[21:49] so praise God he has a plan for all of
[21:52] this but he by his grace on those Eagle
[21:55] Eagle wings I like to say brought us
[21:57] down here after we were debt free praise
[22:01] the Lord Jesus next slide
[22:04] that's why I think our Prophet says this
[22:05] so much and I hope as you're hearing
[22:07] dead we talk about debt but it's really
[22:09] about cleaning up your lives it's
[22:11] cleaning your lives up it's handling in
[22:13] your life like Joseph
[22:15] just being organized diligent about
[22:17] what's happening in your life and our
[22:19] Prophet says clean your lives up pay
[22:21] your debts oh no man Jesus said get all
[22:24] things off your hand get everything
[22:26] right Make Ready Get Ready remember in
[22:29] the name of the Lord something is fixing
[22:32] to happen
[22:33] my my that is the word of God spoken to
[22:36] us by that prophet in 1965.
[22:39] think about how long that has been for
[22:41] us to have these words so it's clean
[22:45] your lives up let's get everything right
[22:46] that's what God is saying get it right
[22:48] he's waiting on us he is waiting on us
[22:52] to get ready
[22:54] so by God's grace let's take these
[22:56] little practical things and apply them
[22:57] to our life right above that before he
[23:00] said this he said
[23:03] and what are we coming here for what are
[23:04] we doing are we coming here playing a
[23:06] game are we coming here meeting as a
[23:08] lodge it's Christ
[23:11] it's it's Christ can't come until the
[23:14] church is perfectly right he's waiting
[23:16] on us
[23:18] that's verse 283 so you can see what it
[23:20] means clean up your lives right in there
[23:22] he's saying get it right get organized
[23:25] make ready we are God has gifted us with
[23:29] the talents to do all these things and
[23:31] we can do it by the grace of the Lord
[23:32] Jesus just start somewhere
[23:35] start somewhere he will add to it
[23:40] next slide
[23:43] let's keep going to the next one
[23:45] so yes and no Prophet just said so many
[23:48] words he said don't you see where the
[23:49] commercial word had commercial world has
[23:51] your nose to the Grind wheel I said
[23:53] don't you see it so the world is full of
[23:55] it full of it advertisements television
[23:58] radio newspapers and if the American
[24:00] people fall for such as that
[24:02] and if the American people fall for such
[24:04] as that just falling for it the devil is
[24:06] deceiving us with all of this yes yes
[24:08] yes yes yes you can do whatever you want
[24:10] you can have whatever you want it's a
[24:11] way you can literally think and do and
[24:13] be whatever you want to be and God in
[24:17] his word is like
[24:18] there's a plan I got something better
[24:20] for you let's go to as we wrap up I want
[24:23] to just share this testimony I know I
