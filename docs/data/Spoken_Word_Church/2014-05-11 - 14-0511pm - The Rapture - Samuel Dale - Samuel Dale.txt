up in it and I was going to say that door was going to open and people was going to walk through that door that we knew like that you know but if that door opens then everybody in there know it was

amen good to be in the house of the Lord if you like turn in your scriptures turn to first Thessalonians 4 and let's get into the thought remember now the fellowship meeting will be this coming Saturday uh brother Douglas will preach the Saturday night he had already discussed it with me he wanted to come down sometime he said just hear us preach and I said well come on down be glad to have you but sure he would love to let Hear You Preach he said well I'll just sit down Sunday morning listen to You Preach I said all right then you just come on down preach Saturday night and that way we'll we'll uh be glad to have our brother and just going into you know and believing the word of the Lord amen I love brother Douglas really appreciate him 1 Thessalonians 4 uh any other announcements just remember the uh 3:30 and remember the getting to food together getting everything together and we certainly do appreciate all of you uh you know and your doings and helpings and all at this time at the times you know when we try to Fellowship together and we pray the Lord would give us good weather and good conditions and everything right Heavenly Father we thank you Lord because we know realize one thing without you there is no hopes of us whatsoever we would not be here there would be no problems we would just would not come be in existence without a Heavenly Father you created us you brought us for a purpose of one thing and that was to glorify you and may we do that this morning I mean this evening Lord in in the message of trying to glorify our father to speak about you but it's not talking about us none of the things we speak of has anything to do with us other than the recipient orever how we say it of that that we can enjoy the benefits of these things but Salvation is of the Lord and we believe you and we thank you just have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and guide us in your grace and love in Jesus name amen amen 1 Thessalonians 4 we'll begin verse 13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you should that ye saw or not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them which also sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep where the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the trumpet of God Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first so let's read that this way for Jesus himself shall descend from heaven is that the way the prophet is explaining right and he does all three of these things so he's going to descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and which is conjunction tying in together and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the hour and so shall we ever be with the Lord you may be seated and what did he say wherefore Comfort ye one another all right Comfort right now you think about comfort that you know it's a position of you know knowing relaxing or whatever you want to do or call it the word comfort and we Comfort one another with these words but now I'm honest because I've always tried to be that way when we used to read that and had it with a you know Lord descend from heaven with a shout and a great big holler and and and then we had a voice of an archangel something out of the sky come down on something and then a big to do do trumpet there wasn't much comfort in that you know cuz I didn't understand it did you but now since it's been explained then we can have at least um comforting uh you know thought right that it can take place amen you know it's it can be real so then we're just not talking about something you know some idea or some thought but looking at the truth of the word now I've been speaking for quite a while and it's going to be odd when you see this in a minute to tie into something else and uh I pray that God will keep our thoughts in align to understand but we've been talking about the Rapture and we know the word rapture is not in the Bible That's caught up as we just read will be caught up all right and then the word caught up is it it's not meaning something of what we look at at looking at it as trying to get our thoughts in there but looking at it that it's a process and we covered it this morning morning we've been over and over resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I believe the moment you receive the new birth no matter what age you were in no matter where Luther Wesley who what age Pentecost or any of them that the minute they received that Holy Ghost that brought that soul up into a caught up condition Hallelujah it brought it up out of the world into a an eternal State for the soul you know in a position and it started the uh part of the going away right all right cuz we had to get the new birth before we could even start talking about going away you know and it's it's something to be able then to say well you know uh we have been in the Rapture from the time we received the new birth but we just didn't know that was what was taking place we we taught it as we believed and done the best we could but now we see that something has been going on you know amen it's not something way off or way back under or something it's something going on now amen I I like to be present tense you know and I like to be I'm prompt I'm doing you know I love to be on time and I like to know what's going on and you tell me to be at your house at 10:00 I'll be there at 10 till but that's just the way I am you know I I want everything because I I'm I'm just built that way well in the gospel I want to know what's going on right and and and you know I want to be not What's called the end thing of today of the young terminologies but I do want to be in on what God is doing you know and be a part of it and all but as I said now from the time we receive the new birth that it starts us into a caught up condition and that will continue until we are totally caught up and taken out of this world and that's what we talk about a Rapture amen which you can see then that I'm talking about something in process you know something that's been going on Amen all right we we read that the Lord would descend from heaven with a shout now I didn't bring all these cuz we read them over time enough that we know the shout is the message that was brought forth but I would like to read you uh this one I like to look at other translations sometime and see what they're saying to see if they can hold a point you know and the JB rotham uh new translation says this in Thessalonians because the Lord himself with a word of command with a chief messenger voice and with the trumpet of God shall descend from heaven Hallelujah now is that close enough to what we see that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout the message all right now we've done enjoyed the message yes right yes you know all right then the voice of the Ark Angel is the same one that raised the dead back there the prophet said the same Lord Jesus so then he's going to be here to raise the dead in the end time but not in a physical Corporal body CU we meet that in the a going toward the Millennium right but we'll read in a minute where he said he will become visible among us and we'll raise the dead and go into Rapture visible what as brother dick said a while ago then when you when you see would be standing here and the doors open and 3 or 4 hundred people come running through the doors everybody in here is going to know it but if no door opens and nothing happens and and you just look and you see somebody standing there then you're going to realize something is taking place but everybody's not going to realize it right you know because they're not prepared amen and if we haven't heard the shout there's no need of talking about the voice of the Archangel or anything about the Trump of God or the trumpet it says Trump there in the scripture but look at up it just means trumpet all right see then as we'll read in just a second the prophet said Jesus does all three well then our part is what to to believe God except what he says and and depend on that and then not have to worry about anything else all right and see then that message that we have already heard right do you believe it's this message that we've heard you know the message that brother Brandon brought in the end time is that message am now I will not get to it now May later if I choose to pick it up but it does say there in the scripture at the light's Trump for the trumpet shall sound that does sound like two trumpets but that's not what it is right it's one trumpet but it's who's doing it and and the background for that if you go back to to when Joshua was going there and he was told to go around the walls of Jericho and uh he instructed the people with I'm just honest now it doesn't matter whether he did or not I'm just making a point it wasn't the voice of Jo of Joshua that brought the walls down it was when the people said the same thing Joshua said amen you read your Bible go around go around go around do all the things you do and then stop turn around to the wall and Shout right well see then God does allow things for you and I and there will be a people you say well brother Dale you was preaching this morning that that you was looking for a BL to come from Heaven I read what brother brandham said about it that's reason I believe it because he was a Vindicated Prophet but you know I believe it's been revealed to me and I can see it that not another messenger is going to come forth we've done her the message not another Prophet to come into being not somebody to raise up in this message and correct all of the wrongs the prophet has said and tell us the right and you know I don't believe in junk I believe that amen out of this message a people is going to come right yes sir who as we were bre reading this morning that will recognize who they are and what they're here for and then it's going to be them that speaks now anything else you want to put with that if you want to go into all of the days and the things that everybody's doing go right ahead just don't leave the bride out because I said about Eve this morning I believe she was brought into the world for the purpose that Adam would not necess necessarily had to sit out there and said let there be and there been no fall or anything it would have been Eve because she was chosen for that to bring forth whatever Adam and that's Bri that brings the bride I've defended the sisters because I've seen what this message has done it's been a wife beater message by 90% of what's in it and you know what I mean by wife beater you know they beat the women to death they don't never say anything about the man he struts you know he oh he's great something you know they beat the women to death well I'm I'm not a femish preacher I believe I'm just tough enough to forget all the rest and I do believe that we all have a part and I do believe that we are the bride of Christ amen and no matter whether it be men or women that's right it is the bride of Christ right because that's what we're chosen to be all right so I'm not looking for something else I'm looking at what we've got right so then before we start on into the part of the message I want to say the message is a shout right all right so the Lord descended and brought a message to you and I all right that message will bring Christ to Earth amen right all right then he will be the voice of the Archangel right that will raise the dead amen all right and then there'll be a trumpet and we'll deal more with that in this message today CU I hope you understand the voice of the Archangel without having to go into a lot about it if the voice of the Archangel was Christ back there and brother R said see it's the same loud voice that raised Lazarus all right that's who we're looking for right and looking for him to become visible Among Us and raise the dead because it's not you and I but we just happen to be the people that the end of all things has come upon am all right now so as we approach this point I want you to think about something we think of rapture as being caught up right now I just went through it so don't lose your mind when you get to New Birth you're caught up and you're being caught up okay that's fine that way but our thoughts is not just on that basis of a birth our thoughts has always been of a Rapture is going up you know going out cuz that's human terminologies all right but now if Jesus does all three of these in his descending why are we looking as much of going away as we're looking as what's taking place among us cuz you're going to be surprised that maybe another message later when we try to tie together caught up in the coming of the Lord you just you're just too too deep you're too just is any problem with the words I use I mean caught up and coming listen church if you can't get nothing else that I'm talking about get one thing I believe that the Rapture is already in a process and and a big portion of the things have already transpired that we would be looking for them to take place all right so now remember looking back we lose it looking forward we lose it amen let's just recognize what's taking place now and what God is doing Among Us that's right there is uh looking back can be a faith Builder but that's not Faith that's right that's a fact that's right right when you're looking back that's a fact it's already happened right now tomorrow is not here and remember when you get to tomorrow tomorrow becomes today right right so why worry about either end of it that's all I've ever tried to get you to see all of the time of ministry is to try to get us to see what's going on right now amen a God that's living revealing himself now and that ought bring something personal to that's right all right let's just read a little bit and then we'll we'll get our thoughts together so go ahead with number one Brothers it's taken from the Rapture message paragraph 129 130 through 131 and back into 130 you'll find it 1129 you'll find that he's saying uh the words used there's three things that happens before the Lord himself appears three things before he appears and well he just misunderstood you know may he he made a slip of the well there's three things there's three things that happens before the Lord himself appear quickly now so we can close the first thing notice the shout of voice and trumpet let's read it now and see it that's right the Lord himself 16th verse shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and the trumpet of God three things happens a voice a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now he still got the same thought come on right now to give you a key to go with it to remember in his coming there's a difference between the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord what your Prophet said okay now hold on then say Jesus does all three of them when he he he he's descended the shout the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride all right now so then the first part or whatever you want to call it or the Rapture in the basis of what it is when it brings it was brought by the prophet it's already over right right y we're looking for something to happen and God saying it's done took place now right to make that right and correct in our human terminologies I've always been a type of person who believes in kind of like progressiveness and starting at an Earnest going to to a you know positive you know somebody just hears the message today well you can't expect them to say they know the message that's right so to them it's just beginning that's right amen that's why it says in the days d a y s it didn't say d a y d a y s days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished right so that means days you know in other words to brother colie he heard of it in 71 okay sister Trudy maybe you heard of it in what 855 90 when she first heard of the message all right see he's heard of the message a long time before she is but it's the same message is the same God so it's in the days of the voice all right so we're still in the days of the voice the m just still going around the world and people are receiving the message right all right so they're It's Beginning so it's a process that's right all right but Jesus does all three in his descending now here's our words descending ascending we're still thinking Rapture is going up remember all three of these takes place before you go up well we better get our mind out of Heaven that's true and get down to earth amen what was that saying if I misquote it but it's close some people are too Heavenly minded to be of any Earthly good right some people are so Earthly minded they're no Heavenly good all right right you know everybody wants to spiritualize everything well it's good but you had never you was in the Baptist you know in the Baptist we preached that there was a great God who healed the sick and done this that and the other and when it come to the Blind Men you know man and the Lord prayed for him and his eyes was healed you know well we preach that is a spiritual happening well first all we didn't believe in Divine Healing but you know we preached that that was a spiritual happening and everybody is so happy that it was a spiritual we thought it was a physical well it was both of them if we did had it right it was a physical healing all right and then they could go on and receive the Holy Ghost to get their eyes opened but we got to get it all you know figured out and I know and realize one thing you can sit and listen to brother random every day of your life play the takes 24 hours a day and never turn them off never go to sleep and live 50 years and listen to Tes end of that you have a head full but there's no Revelation unless God's revealed it as I say in this morning we than the prophet said it it's revealed no quick as he spoke it it put it right back into a prophecy this message is still a prophecy until it's revealed to you and I all right now so in dealing with it should we be dealing with something going up or in how it comes down are we dealing with the going the way or the coming come on that's good well no we're dealing with going away brother Dale I'm sitting tired this whole world I don't to get out of here only way we can get out of here is for him to come down here that's right right that's right so then maybe were to get concerned about it all three of these things shout voice of an archangel Trum happens here on Earth all right Paul says that but he doesn't speak of he uses the word caught away but in his word caught away he says we're caught up to meet the Lord in the air now he doesn't bring out dire come on put it up there let's read it 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 I want you to just read your Bible I like like to read the Bible I like for you to read the Bible so go ahead and pull up 1 Thessalonians 4 this should be number two when you notes in there the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first now so you got the things that to transpire in the dead raises right all right then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds that's good but there's a little word missing there all right go to 1 Corinthians 15 and let's read what Paul says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the Li's Trump oh for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed all right now we're coming into a situation of understanding something that maybe brother brandham wasn't dealing with it when he preached the message of the rapture in the bases that we think going up maybe he knew that going up wouldn't help us a lot but if God can come down here yes I know the first time I saw that and the prophet I heard him one day like this and he said he said Jehovah the Old Testament he said God back there he said in all the sin of Israel and all the bad that they were doing he said God busied himself like a father with his family I just cried I thought you mean God would love me enough to come down here the whole of the Bible the whole of the Bible the entire concept of the Bible all that you got is him coming here amen we ain't got to worry about it we just got to worry about getting him here sir and if it's right that the prophet would cover it we'll get to later that the coming of the Lord is the revealing of his word amen why are we still looking for some physicals or some forms or something instead of look looking what's taking place that's right so now Paul adds together with Thessalonians he gives you a key so now we read Thessalonians the Lord himself shall defend from heaven with the shout voice of an archangel and from God and we'll be caught up overlay Thessalonians Corinthians together and your thought and what do you see the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout voice of an archangel Trump will be changed and caught up change is going to take place here because that's what he said it change a moment twinkle of an eye and then we'll go to meet the Lord I mean why can't we just sit down and simply think things out okay go one time time he's seemingly covered Heaven would shout voice trumpet and we're done gone the next time he's dealing with it and it seem like he's saying you know something's going to happen here we're going to be changed we got to be changed before we can be caught up or taken off the Earth so now you'll see what I'm do driving at I'm driving at one thing something takes place here everything takes place here and then we go there are you listening yes so then I'm not looking for some splitting of the skies in him coming I'm looking at the message already be in the shout right amen and that then Jesus has already descended now let me get this clear I'm not of that group that years ago used to preach that in 1963 the Lord came now I don't believe like they do I I believe the Lord came yeah okay but I believe he came on day of Pentecost I believe he came in the garden I believe he's been coming all along but there's no you won't get me tied up with that perusia and or paria as they say the word is I honestly believe in his presence but I don't want God standing right here beside of me thank you I want him inside of here he's standing right here he going to have to kill me for what I do and you too that's right it's all right you see I require I know I do I require that you think why not we were giv the brain that's right right but you know what a lot of people do they want to take them out like a BB in a car box and play with them you know what that means don't you bb in a car box some people shaking their head these people from foreign countries they don't know what we talk about a lot a BB in a car box couldn't you just hear it that's all it's doing put in a matchbox where you could realize and go Shak sh sh sh it's just rattle rattle rattle rattle rattle rattle cuz there ain't nothing to it but what about a god who would create a human being amen so perfect yes so wonderful yes so A beautiful Masterpiece and then come down here to live with us you know one of these days a future home is going to be where my understanding I thought it was coming down so maybe we need to get away from wanting to go up so much you know is to start realizing things are taking place down here you know that brother randam said about the change he said you just turn around and what he said them saints now was like 20 ft at a slant I don't know how to explain that I ain't a scientist but it's another dimension right see we can just turn around and be right here not in this garbage but you be here in a Utopia if you don't get nothing out when we get into the message of the coming of the Lord maybe that'll help us because my whole point for ever since I started in this message and begin to see what that Prophet was talking about it's talking about God coming here not us going there boy what you just being that old Baptist and I'm not throwing off on them it's just where I come from Bo one of these days these bodies God's going to give us a new one cuz he can't do nothing with this one he's going to give us a new body and then we're going to leave this world we're going up in the clouds and we're going to sit on the harps and play I mean sit on the clouds and play Harps you know well I never was no good at playing instruments I own a lot of them back here but I can't play one of them and I don't think a change of the body would make me be able to play I'm not interested in that and listen I know I made the statement years ago and I know that brother Dale I made the statement and I still believe it when I come in the message I looked at it you know as upwards as goings and whatever because that's what we believed in the Baptist but you know one day I stood right here and told you I said I'm not looking anymore to go to heaven for 40 something years I've not been trying to go to heaven I've been trying to get heaven to come here sir a lot of difference in it you know and I'm not a good old Jehovah Witness is we're going to be going along here today building cars and tomorrow God's going to come and we're going to be happy and everything's okay or be the same no not garbage can I'm just saying and I try to be sensible to think things over and let God reveal it we can talk about going to heaven all we want to I believe was brother Woodby I think was the one that said it in he said you know we got to have a little heaven to go to heaven on that's right if God don't come here if he don't come here then the Bible's wrong God I want you to show me in the Bible I'm open for women kids anybody to show me in the Bible where everything is going up well all it does to me it just turns right around and we're right back here you see but yet you're destroying all of my thoughts cuz mama told me one day we're going to sail through the sky yeah but listen if Jesus all does all three in his descending you know what that's his coming I don't ask you to amen it's a quiet congregation anyway around here because you know U as one brother said you know amen is a little nod he said if you really get happy it's it's hard to think when you're hollering amen that's right now I try to amen a lot because I amen what I believe but I amen here one day and about that time that brother went some of them come to me later and said you amen what he said I said no I didn't I said I amen what he had said not what he went on and said now but if Jesus does all three in his descending then the Rapture must be in some way connected to the coming of the [Music] Lord my point is we try to deal or talk about a Rapture or a going up when the prophet is talking about a descending I'm talking about Paul I'm talking about brother brandham if we believe the shout is the message as he says it is then that's taken place here and has already happened then the Lord coming here not as a physical returning but coming here in Bride form you know in his bride where's the voice of the Archangel going to be all right then if the trumpet as the prophet go CED in the Rapture message that Israel was gathered at the Feast of the trumpets the trumpet would sound and the people would gather he said well there's a lot more goes of that yes I'll agree because go on to the next quote that a trumpet denotes I don't mean on the message here they're getting ahead of me now see the Lord Jesus it's not like you and I think about it that's right of his coming it's not that a way it's the thing of it need to do we need to get down if you don't get nothing else and I'll try to get away from this is to get it's got to be somebody cuz connected to his coming if it's not a physical that's right you know if it's a physical we can understand he just stepped down on Earth but then your Prophet said he doesn't do that and the Bible says we meet him in the hour and the prophet said he don't set foot on Earth until the Millennium well and ident even the trumpet as a gathering of the children of Israel together it also means the announcing of a great person is a trumpet you remember when the king would go out right and they'd be a trumpet to announce the coming that's right of the great king listening to brother Brandon one day and I thought well that's true he said even if an actor was in the part of a play and said that trumpet sound he said that actor quit you remember that he said if he's selling his goods and he's just reaching out for his money we hard to put that today all right we said he's reaching out for his money and he said the trumpet sound that he bows to his knees well you know what happened today and you finally get down after you snatch the money out but that wasn't exactly what he was explaining he was showing the sincerity of the trumpet that's right you know what you get your head cut off we're not doing what they told you that's right very serious but listen if the shout is a message then was this brother bram's message or was it the message of the Lord come on or did he say the messenger in the Lord's message is that a scripture the messenger in the Lord's message see we want to make it R around his message that's fine because he brought it that's right and he gets honor for bringing it but it was not his message that's right it was the message of God hallelujah it was not the descending of William brandham come on brother it was the Lord Jesus amen using a man amen looking down out of the sky am I quoting it there in Arizona they talk about the people saying that that 63 the Lord descended but now they're said none of that ain't right wrong time and all this that and the other we see if God hadn't to come in the prophet on the Ohio River and declared what his message was going to be right do you think 63 would have been worth anything right and like I said the other day in the spoken words of Original Seed where brother brandham says Lord what can I do I got him out on a limb he said pick up your pen and write he says as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled come on read spoken words reading of seed probably about 125 is a big book but think about it maybe we should quit trying to deal with going away and try to deal with what's taking place CU remember we have got to get to a place that these things can take place amen that's right all right okay before we go there we have to be right here amen and see then there's no uh can I quote the scripture without you going the wrong way Flesh and Blood shall not enter the kingdom come on amen that's that's but it doesn't mean that we won't be in flesh and be there that's nothing nothing to do with it that's right it's not Jesus when he said touch me because the spirit has not flesh and Bone he's not explaining that this his blood was laying off over here and this is over here he just telling you like it is all right but you see if Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the Kingdom then something going to have to happen here right before we go there that's right he said well I understand this brother well maybe the person next to you don't right right and I wouldn't go to sleep if I was you and think you already had it I might surprise you okay but look when the prophet made this statement go to Number Four Brothers when he made this statement and the first time I remember it it was really a shocking thing roll it on up it's off of the what was the Holy Ghost given for how long how long how much longer God's waiting on me and you right cat that right there the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection amen Now where's the resurrection going to be then we want to talk about the power where's the resurrection that when the church in Christ be comes so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into Rapture visible Among Us you're confusing me no no you're already confused I'm trying to get you straight in out well you talking about a coming and around talking about a going show me where he's talking about to going I'll ask you go and run around his message and see what he's talking about a going he's always talking about something here that's right obliged to come forth a refilling of the holy spirit amen that you worked in party said brother Dale are you expecting a refilling I sure am but you know what every day when he revealed that word to me I get a refilling amen that's why I'm happy this morning when I saying it I'm not sad and down and out I'm happy because right when I get down and out I know something's fixed in the open am I've learned that much why because the devil's trying to keep me right from believing it when it comes what you think brother then we going to get a refilling they got many fillings in the book of Acts amen those that already had the Holy Ghost many feelings only one new birth that's right but then when you drop to the pyramid and look at it virtue not you're being born again by The Incorruptible word of God so something's in process am church that that's all I've ever tried to say God doesn't do things just like we think it it's always a process I've always told you you can believe what you want to I'm just make a point but I'm trying to make a show you a process we think of them all them animals getting on the ark right I believe it I believe there two of each kind of every animal on the earth now there wasn't 49,000 different kind of dogs it was two dogs in the two dogs with everybody everything in two horses they was all the horses they went 99 different stages of horses that's right don't be silly that's right then get out up to think the Unicorn didn't make it cuz he didn't exist but you see I've told you my thoughts 120 years Noah was preaching it took 120 years to get that now I don't know my continents right when I say Africa I mean Africa I don't know I don't know the continents I don't know who's connected to who but you don't there's a lot of water and there was then and land and but you just think about that old elephant say that elephant was 4,000 miles away right so he was on the other side of the world see you think it was maybe together but it's all right you know what I think about and more elephant started moving he moved five miles and he died oh Lord he had a baby and it moved five more miles right you know what had a while that 4,000 miles done covered and there goes two elephants walking on the ark they started 120 years before that's right God getting them ready amen he doesn't do anything abruptly come on that's good he works on both ends amen that's right brother R said look what he had to do is he had to breed this to that to this to that this to that to get you here some of these days take your journey I was a sinner out in the world and one day I become a presbyterian oh Lord thank you Jesus and then I kept walking and I heard the message Hallelujah right you know God doesn't do like we do he don't worry about time he's not concerned and wor about 120 years get two animals on the ark I'm just trying to explain God right that God is Not So as we think it took him a long time to get all of you sitting here that's right right think about it he says waiting on you and I that's right okay put that in there I won't charge you for it what you he said he raised the dead and we go in Rapture because he's become visible among us all right so if he's visible Among Us it's him going to be raised the dead that's right see that's what everybody says you know I first come in the message let's go on that third pool one day I'll get that word and I'll just speak that word I'll just speak it it'll happen I said you got to get it first that's right what was wrong with that statement brother Dale don't understand we are in the message oh Lord but is the message in us come on brother so there any problem with the shout already being taken place no was the message you brother around Andro any problems with that is any problems then if that's taking place at divorce of the Archangel would be here with us yes yeah but I thought boy we I thought one of these days we going to that's what we we we see we we that was Eve's problem in the garden that's right and she just simply waited on God everything would have taken place there wouldn't have been no problem but she couldn't wait that's right she had to be so spiritual get it all figured out so then the voice of the Archangel if the shout is correct of the message and we've done receed the voice of the Archangel is here that's right it took God want to say 2,000 years almost to bring Israel to the promised land or maybe even more you know the whole time they was marching you know when Ezekiel Saw that wheel in the middle of the wheel and all of them animals running all he saw the travel of Israel we know he probably saw it down through the church ages too as they were being killed by this group of people they moved to another place God's tender hand of Love why didn't he just go down get back over there C 6 million Jews their lives just that along that we know of to get them back to the Homeland right right does that look like a loving God yes it took all that to get them back but you know what and your Prophet come along and preach the fifth seal message and he said n not ever Jew we said those people from Calvary down to this end time have been killed and run about all over but he said God's going to give them white robes amen right doing them a favor I know I think different than most people but I used to read the Bible and God would tell the children of Israel said go into them amorites them jebusites and all kind of sites and they he need say destroy every one of them men women and children I used to think okay Lord old people live young people's live but why them babies right that's right one day I heard the prophet say it like this he said all babies go to heaven right and I thought you know if it hadn't been for him doing that all them babies would have went to hell that's right he done them a favor but taking their life send them to Heaven you're a funny preacher I agree with you but I like it you know I like it this way I can at least stay in the Bible amen what would be the trouble then if we can believe that the shout was the message and the V of the course of the Archangel would be in the bride in the end time to call the dead but you might not believe that because you may believe in other terminologies but somewhere somebody's going to call the dead I believe that so whatever you believe you still got to put it that they're depending on somebody whether you want to make it just brother random coming back and doing it or where you want to make it to bride or whatever you still got to say there got to be somebody that's going to be used amen but you know what it won't be that somebody it' be Jesus Christ right all right what about the trumpet then what about the trumpet well we used to think that one day we'd hear you know we hear a trumpet but what about that trumpet let's just read a few quotes and then let you think about what's going on look at number five taking to Revelation chapter 4 paragraph 159 when the Bible comes the word of God and every word of God is a trumpet every sound of the word is a trumpet the gospel trumpet the gospel trumpet what about it look at to patma Vision page 48 when a trumpet is blown it has an urgency about it it is like The Hurl of the king's messenger coming to the people he blows on a trumpet it is an urgent call the people gather to listen Israel was always assembled by the sounding of a trumpet something important is at hand listen to it know this voice had the same urgency of appeal as did the trumpet clear and strong it was startling and Awakening oh that we might hear the voice of God as a trumpet this day but it is the gospel trumpet sounding forth the word of Prophecy to make us aware and prepared for what is coming upon the Earth right amen a gospel trumpet go ahead to the next one the 10 virgins and 144,000 Jews preaching and uh 60 1211 the morning service are we which are alive and remain under the coming of the Lord down here shall not prevent or hinder Now where's that at is that first Thessalonians right that's what it is isn't it them precious ones that seal their blood seal their testimony with their blood not prevent or hinder those that are asleep for the trumpet will sound something will take place the gospel something will sound the announcing of his coming and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be change that's putting Thessalonians and Corinthians together you understand what I done while IO right I said overlay them come on this scripture up here about sleep and all Lord himself s descending now he's down here talking about a change he's putting Thessalonians and Corinthians together amen but what's he saying gospel something will sound now he said the announcing of his coming he's putting Thessalonians and Corinthians together to talk about announcing of his coming well I I thought it going that way yeah we might order to talk about his coming but we think about a trumpet as what look at the next one which is the Feast of the trumpets 647 uh 19 the morning service 142 143 I notice the trumpet is to call together the people assemble themselves together for something sometime it announced an important person now he just said to one before that it was his coming right like in Joseph they sounded a trumpet and Joseph was appearing which is a symbol of the great trumpet right go to Feast of the trumpets and read the great trumpet that we speak of and get to after a while in Isaiah and when the Great trumpet sounds when that ins sign will be lifted up right up there and then there will come a time when the Great trumpet will be sounded and all the nations were gathered to Jerusalem that's when the Millennium starts the great trumpet so if the great trumpet is dealing with bringing Israel to the Millennium what about the trumpet it's going to bring you and I to a place of being changed see the coming of the Lord and the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ has to be connected together look at number nine taking from why Christ PE paragraph 47 going all the way to the bottom of it you read in between keep on rolling it up cut it on down supposed to be marked there we go when we see a God who can take a cancer that's eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man Hallelujah that order to give rapturing Faith to the people right that when that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together come on Chang in a moment and taken into the heavens yeah there's got to be something like that happened in our schools of theolog theology can never produce that yet they intellectually are all right but you got to meet that light you got to find something right on to the next one questions and answers 64 will the bride be gathered together in one place at the Rapture when will it be in the west nope don't have to be there yep or yeah the bride will be gathered together in one place now he just said in the west he said no now he's turning back around and said it's going to be gathered in one place come on where's that one place come on this is true but not until the resurrection that's right not until the resurrection by which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord Ephesians first second but it's really first test on and it's the fourth chapter he was a human being I believe it is we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep universally for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and which and we shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the hour therefore the bride will all be together when it go be together when it goes to meet the Lord we're going to be together when we go meet the Lord that's after the resurrection all right so if the voice of the Archangel raises the Dead don't you think there'll be a gospel trumpet like brother dick said while ago the do swing open and all you everybody know something went on when it's a secret thing but now how many times have I made this illustration and I'm going to make one more time you mean we see the dead raised Among Us and I call up brother Mark and I said brother Mark we seen the dead ra ain't that something he said well yeah I guess it is but I got to go sell some cars right and I called Brother Dean I said Brother Dean you know we've seen the Dead gra he said well that's good but but I've got to work on a tractor now I don't think that's exactly what's going to take place right when they say the Dead's raised Among Us I say who are they who' it look like we got pictures downstairs they let you know who these look like when they died 50 60 70 80 years old but his pictures down there about 20 best we can do I want to know what to look like he said when now brother Dale what I've seen and I don't mean this wrong now I Ain going to use no name I I'll make a story we've seen a bunch of Pentecostal people and they raised and it was oh doctor so and so and this on now now we do realize they didn't believe the message oh my oh my now what's the point I don't believe we're going to see Paul's people no do you we will when we get together going on up but in the resurrection part of right we're going to see what's related to our day and the hour that we're living not everybody else that's right cuz they're going to come up in a dimensional ways and different whatever what are you getting at I'm getting at one thing you talk about a gospel trumpet you talk about a shou and holler Glory hallelujah amen some of them this morning said they didn't believe I could still jump around a little bit I reckon they called him too old but listen folks is that what it's well I okay I'll see you Sunday if it's not bad weather oh Lord and we'll see the dead in the church no no no it ain't going to be that way it's going to be all these internets and tex going they're going to be telling everybody in the world the Dead's raised come on and it won't be no problem saying everybody want to meet at church tonight we'll be there it's going to be a glorious time when you see Mama daddy brother sister kids walk among you yes Lord you talk about a gospel trumpet shout that he I thought the trumpet was to gather the people together after the resurrection that's right that's what your Prophet just said come on folks come on musician if you don't see what I'm talking about oh Lord there's going to be a glorious gospel trumpet sound at that time but there'll also be a lot of Straight Jackets he'll be trying to put you in but don't you worry about it you know what brother random I tried to find it but it's PR foras and that's close he said when you see the dead rais you know you're going you think I'm going going to be worried may I quote another one he said your job won't be important about that time that's right right well I got to go to work I heard a dead rais but I got to go to work no CU you know it ain't going to be long to most you got 30 40 days I got enough fat stored up in my body to live nearly that long even his skinni Ben h i mean b skinny back there is he likes a while we W have to worry about it because we'll just speak what we have need of do you understand we're trying to go that way God's trying to tell us he's coming this way let's get our directions right and get what it's supposed to be the Lord will descend from heaven and he already has with the message in that message is the voice of the resurrection and the trumpet is to gather the people together the prophet said after the resurrection I'm looking forward to that time I don't know about you it may cost a lot of us our lives and our things what does it matter who cares what does it make any difference I'm too far up the road for to talk about baby things right so evidently the Rapture is the coming of the Lord that don't fit I don't fit head knowledge does it sister Gil a Rapture going coming you're looking at it that way I'm looking at it this way I'm trying to preach what your Prophet said he evidently was talking about the descending CU he's the one who said it you'll become visible among us what we got let's Stand Together number he'll become visible Among Us and raise the dead and we'll go into [Music] Rapture anybody have a need say I believe that same God is still alive he's alive right here Among [Music] Us God in the name of Jesus Christ we just lay our hands there in commemoration of our sister's Faith she walked up here she would have done that if she didn't believe so we're believing with her that by your stri she's healed in Jesus name okay that simple believe it believe and see [Music] [Music] well let's just send them one and tell them the best place to put it it on the mattress the bed and we believe that all will be well we commit it to you Lord now in Jesus name amen anybody else see we have not because we ask not you know we ask verbally you know we ask verbally we won't you [Music] know but do we really just put it on the line and say Lord you promised it you promised it and I believe it prophet of God said one day he said you if you can find in God's Bible what he promised you call him on the scene he said he's a liar if he won't do it now that's a great challenge isn't it but it's believing just simply believing say thank you there's not anybody here that wouldn't i' say well I I'll just I'll give you $100 to walk up here there's not anybody in here that doubted I wouldn't try my best to do that cuz you've been around a long time most of you you know i' try but if I'm that could keep my word what about God keeping his word when he says we are already healed think about it Church remember the services next weekend brother Douglas being here and bring go ahead How Sweet the that [Applause] [Music] the was but now I I was blind but now I [Music] see was that you believe him you love him then you talk to him Lord speak to me about what this man has been trying to say because it sounds like he saying what the prophet said
