[0:00] inside as you keep going in your life
[0:01] like I said before you got no hope no
[0:04] more worth to you than mmm I don't know
[0:09] and you know what he's not gonna give
[0:11] you everything at one time
[0:12] you might get one thought a month but
[0:17] you know what at least you got that I'll
[0:19] promise you you get a revelation of the
[0:20] word Satan did not do that it comes from
[0:24] God
[0:25] okay so just feel just feel confident
[0:27] that God is the one that gives you a
[0:30] revelation of the word right for one who
[0:35] is made not after the law of carnal
[0:37] commandment what's Paul saying he's
[0:39] separating them to Levis because they
[0:40] came under colonel you know man and
[0:43] woman come together have a baby in the
[0:45] Levitical priesthood every man was
[0:46] satisfied and they ran the Levitical
[0:49] line or lineage this man had no lineage
[0:53] remember he didn't have father a mother
[0:55] our descent for he testified our to
[1:01] priest forever after the order of
[1:05] Melchizedek for there's very a variant
[1:10] where there is barely a dis annulling of
[1:13] the commandment going before for the
[1:15] weakness and unprofitability this
[1:17] unprofitable miss thereof we're going
[1:21] words Don Brown so now look what's that
[1:25] saying for there's very a dissing only
[1:27] of the commandment in other words Jesus
[1:28] didn't come to do away with the law but
[1:31] what he done was that he made the law
[1:33] liveable and it dissing though the
[1:37] commandment because the priests said hey
[1:39] I haven't touched a woman the Bible says
[1:43] in the Testaments to not commit adultery
[1:45] that means to literally act on the 27
[1:50] I can prove all the way through the
[1:51] Bible that your your flesh doesn't sin
[1:55] before that wasn't one over
[1:59] we were at but but I can prove that
[2:03] Jesus here's the woman caught in the act
[2:08] of adultery Jesus said oh I didn't see
[2:10] it so go and sin no more but what
[2:11] happened when Jesus walks up to them
[2:13] he reads the end of the the old high
[2:16] priest they're like that touched a woman
[2:19] if they did they had to tell them hey I
[2:21] didn't touch the woman that middle one
[2:23] have not had fleshly carnal relations
[2:26] with nobody but my wife jesus said if
[2:29] you look on a woman and lust after in
[2:31] your heart you've already committed a
[2:35] dolphin none never committed the act
[2:37] with this so this is not the part we
[2:40] have to worry about Jesus is saying you
[2:42] better worry about that inside guy till
[2:44] he said if you look honor to less there
[2:46] you've already committed the daughter
[2:50] because the inside motivator anyway you
[2:53] know that for the law made nothing
[2:57] perfect then we've just been talking
[3:00] about that for 30 minutes the law had
[3:03] made nothing in the Old Testament
[3:04] perfect but for the bringing of a better
[3:08] hope did for by the which we draw nigh
[3:11] onto God in other words what Jesus
[3:12] Christ came to eradicate sin and then we
[3:16] fall under that receive what he give us
[3:18] and then we draw nigh unto God and
[3:21] instantly it's not without an oath he
[3:24] was made priest in other words he wasn't
[3:27] in the Levitical priesthood but he is
[3:29] our high priest and then here's here's
[3:33] he's interpolating those remember
[3:36] interpolating isn't the end of the
[3:38] parenthesis because it should read this
[3:39] and as much as not without an oath he
[3:41] was made priest by so much was Jesus
[3:44] made sure to have a better Testament the
[3:46] Paul interpolates are adds a little bit
[3:48] to it he's not add to the word he's
[3:50] riding to work okay he's not he's not
[3:52] add me riding from those priests were
[3:55] made without an oath but this women oh
[3:58] by him that said of him the Lord sware
[4:00] and will not repent in other words the
[4:02] high priest could have swore to you that
[4:05] you were forgive
[4:06] report the Jesus Christ when he says
[4:10] you're forgiven
[4:10] you're done you don't have to do it he
[4:13] don't have to go counsel with anyone a
[4:15] help
[4:16] he is the counsel thank the Lord sware
[4:21] him will not repent thou art a priest
[4:23] forever after the order of melchizedek
[4:25] now he's finishing his thought by so
[4:28] much was Jesus made a surety of a better
[4:31] Testament why the Testament was in his
[4:34] blood remember we're gonna take
[4:35] communion today jesus said thereon and
[4:37] the remedies that this is a new
[4:38] Testament in my blood which I've said it
[4:41] for you in other words they was enough
[4:43] there was life in that blood that could
[4:45] come back on the believer and take the
[4:48] sin away there was not life in an animal
[4:50] that could die and then that Lamb come
[4:54] back into our that office or that
[4:56] whatever could come back into the
[4:57] believer and clean them up for by so
[5:02] much with Jesus made a surety of a
[5:07] better Testament and they truly were
[5:11] many priests because they were not
[5:13] suffered to continue by reason of death
[5:18] one priest I know them come up they've
[5:20] reached down and they'll come up right
[5:23] when priest I know they'll come in
[5:25] though the free stuff this priest died
[5:27] one time and that was it do you have
[5:30] time to long but this man because he
[5:34] continually continuous ever had an
[5:39] unchangeable priesthood amen
[5:43] what a surety and changeable priesthood
[5:49] you know I guess it was a little I guess
[5:57] in freedom Levitical priesthood you did
[5:59] have different personalities now we know
[6:01] they did try to do the right thing you
[6:03] know that because they were under the
[6:04] law but I was I've been reading in
[6:07] chronicles and then Kings were men this
[6:10] person would come in and be king and and
[6:13] he fire all the Levites you know well
[6:16] Farah permanently and then he brings so
[6:19] many other people in then they'd bring
[6:21] these people in and then you bring this
[6:22] one in and this one to stand up and say
[6:24] this different what stand up and say
[6:25] that mm-hmm I guess it did change it
[6:29] didn't change the priesthood apart but
[6:30] they had different personalities what
[6:31] I'm saying is we know God's personality
[6:34] and that does not anything it's Anna
[6:37] surety that if you should hear what
[6:38] Christ says then he ain't gonna change
[6:41] it it's an unchangeable priesthood but
[6:48] wherefore he is able also to save them
[6:51] to the uttermost that come unto God by
[6:53] him who by Christ seeing he ever liveth
[6:56] to make intercession for them for such
[6:59] an high priest became us who is holy and
[7:03] harmless undefiled separate from sinners
[7:07] and made higher than the heavens
[7:15] we're such a high priest was spitting
[7:18] for us the numbers that didn't become us
[7:21] but he difficulties but you see when did
[7:25] he became a high priest for us who is
[7:27] holy harmless undefiled separate from
[7:29] sinners and made higher than the heavens
[7:31] who need not daily as those high priests
[7:34] to offer up sacrifices
[7:38] Biki because remember in your Levitical
[7:43] your high priests had to go in and make
[7:45] a sacrifice for his sin first in the Old
[7:51] Testament then he made the atonement for
[7:53] the rest of the of the country now
[7:57] Christ didn't have to do that who needed
[8:01] not daily as those high priests to offer
[8:04] up sacrifice first for his own sins and
[8:06] then for the people for this he did once
[8:10] when he offered up himself right for the
[8:14] law maketh man high priests which have
[8:16] been permanent are but have weaknesses
[8:24] but the word of the oath which was sense
[8:27] the law make it the son who is
[8:30] consecrated forevermore pretty good
[8:36] pretty good summation now let's go now
[8:40] cuz I like Paul what you saying now of
[8:43] the things which we have spoken in other
[8:44] words a whole chapter 7 he's gonna sum
[8:46] it up this is the sum or this is the
[8:50] what this is what I'm talking about put
[8:52] it that way
[8:53] main point this is the main point we
[8:58] have such a high priest who is set on
[9:00] the right hand of the throne of the
[9:01] Majesty in heaven a minister of the
[9:04] sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle
[9:06] which the Lord pitched and not man was
[9:09] the true tabernacle
[9:11] you and I think them and not man he
[9:14] ditched it for every high priestess
[9:17] ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices
[9:19] where him is of necessity this man have
[9:22] someone also to offer where he were on
[9:25] earth he should not be a priest in that
[9:29] there are priests to offer gifts
[9:30] according to the law no words have
[9:32] people they're gonna go his servant to
[9:34] the example and shadow of heavenly
[9:37] things as Moses was admonished of God
[9:40] when he was about to make the tabernacle
[9:43] for ceased a team that now make all
[9:45] things according to the pattern showed
[9:47] to be in the mouth brother Brown told us
[9:49] he went to the mountain got the
[9:52] dimensions and everything to build the
[9:54] tabernacle alright but now have he
[9:57] obtained a more excellent ministry for
[10:01] how much also he is the mediator of a
[10:04] better covenant what first covenant
[10:06] wasn't do this don't do that long as you
[10:08] don't touch a woman you're good now
[10:09] which was established upon better
[10:12] promises by how much also he is the
[10:16] mediator of a better covenant this
[10:19] covenant is I'm gonna wipe your sins
[10:20] away pubis if you'll just come to me all
[10:23] ye that labor is heavy rest let heavy
[10:25] late and I'll give you rest which was
[10:28] established upon better promises what go
[10:29] back to the mutability of God for if
[10:33] that first covenant had been faultless
[10:35] then should no place have been soft for
[10:38] the second in other words if it was
[10:41] finally we wouldn't be coming to church
[10:43] today brother they would be cutting the
[10:46] throats of lambs and chickens and goats
[10:49] making sacrifices and we're saying home
[10:54] over there somewhere but no now he's
[10:58] going to make all this plain that that
[11:00] you and I now come boldly to the throne
[11:02] the ones that entered in the bales been
[11:04] rent everything's been took away from
[11:06] and then you and I are now the
[11:09] tabernacle and the temple of God for
[11:12] finding fault with them he said behold
[11:14] the days come saith the Lord when I will
[11:16] make a new covenant with the house of
[11:18] Israel with the house of Judah not
[11:20] according to the Covenant that I made
[11:22] with their fathers in the day when I
[11:24] took them by the hand to lead them out
[11:25] of the land of egypt because they
[11:27] continued not in my covenant and i
[11:29] regarded them not in other words that
[11:31] please put this before you put them away
[11:34] well this is the covenant that i will
[11:36] make with the house of israel after
[11:37] those days saith the lord i will put my
[11:40] law not on a table hosting 10
[11:46] commandments in your yard is nice but
[11:53] don't be sitting on a porch drinking a
[11:54] beer while you what are you doing okay
[11:57] you know this place that way well this
[12:02] is a covenant that i will make with the
[12:04] house of israel after those dates that
[12:05] the Lord I will put my laws into their
[12:07] mind and wrap them in their heart and I
[12:11] will be with them in garden they should
[12:13] be my people
[12:15] let's finish this and they shall not
[12:17] teach every man his neighbour and never
[12:19] manage brother saying know the Lord for
[12:22] all of shall know me from the least to
[12:23] the graves now that doesn't mean what is
[12:26] he saying here the high priest is the
[12:28] only one that you got back in the Old
[12:30] Testament concrete went in he's when I
[12:32] saw his Shekinah glory nobody else saw
[12:34] that part of God now you and I come ball
[12:38] into the throne you should know the Lord
[12:40] because if you got the new birth you got
[12:41] the Lord inside of you for all shall
[12:43] know me from the least to the greatest
[12:45] for I will be merciful to their
[12:46] unrighteousness and their sins and their
[12:49] iniquities will I remember no more thank
[12:51] God and that he said they knew come that
[12:55] he have made the first oh now that which
[12:59] they can't and waxes old is ready to
[13:02] vanish away all right we'll stop
[13:07] then we'll start right there next Sunday
[13:09] then barely the first covenant had also
[13:11] orbited the divine service and worldly
[13:13] sanctuary now that don't mean worldly
[13:15] like we say worldly that means it was
[13:17] down here on earth and they were
[13:19] bridging more during whatever it is
[13:21] [Music]
[13:24] [Applause]
[13:27] that's a weird day yeah bro deal it will
[13:30] cover some of that yes all right
[13:45] Hebrews chapter 7
[13:48] [Music]
[13:56] okay alright he was having several go
[14:01] back to chapter six for just a minute
[14:03] and read let's do it let's look at this
[14:11] for everybody when we look at this
[14:13] immutability we looked at a couple of
[14:15] Sundays ago and thanks all of y'all for
[14:18] doing your job while we're gone I have
[14:21] not had an opportunity to listen to your
[14:22] gift
[14:23] save the best for last
[14:28] we want to talk about the mutability or
[14:31] in other words there is no it never
[14:35] changes we we have an unchanging God and
[14:41] his if he's an unchanging God then his
[14:43] counsel is unchangeable which means that
[14:48] when you have a counsel you have people
[14:50] because I'm getting the milk Emily when
[14:51] you're looking you get a council of
[14:53] people when you get together with and we
[14:55] have them you have a student council we
[14:57] have we're called council members
[15:00] elected official at the City and Guilds
[15:03] bill you get together you got all these
[15:04] different ideas that's not God you don't
[15:09] take counsel from no one no one changes
[15:14] his mind he can't even change his own
[15:16] mind because they said that by two but
[15:20] now luck but what we're getting into
[15:23] what we're going to get into to see more
[15:27] about this seal this afternoon that by
[15:31] two immutable things two unchangeable
[15:35] things remember brother man talks about
[15:37] to own impotence meet because God being
[15:43] alone is not God
[15:48] go back to what brother Ram said he
[15:51] wasn't God he went God's eyes how the
[15:54] worship he wasn't gone before he will
[15:56] himself existing he he self existed
[15:59] alone
[16:00] he wasn't even God now we're in God so
[16:05] now being God he has to have subjects
[16:07] and I like what a man said I was looking
[16:10] to the radio I can't remember the guys
[16:12] name but he'd come on its own the fish
[16:15] and he he's a thug Robbie's a crime and
[16:19] he's talking about people saying well
[16:22] there's no good and evil it's all of
[16:24] this you know well in the presence of
[16:26] good there has to be evil to make the
[16:33] good good and then the presence of evil
[16:36] has to make good so you can't have you
[16:40] can't have just where people think well
[16:42] there's no God and doesn't know anything
[16:43] going up no you got to have to you got
[16:47] I'll tell you you got to help me then
[16:49] you got a heaven
[16:51] two immutable things in which it was
[16:53] impossible for God to lie so he's not
[16:55] gonna like we might have a strong
[16:58] consolation who have fled for refuge to
[17:01] lay hold upon the hope set before us we
[17:03] totally have as an anchor of the soul
[17:05] what that he's immutable and Paulson
[17:09] he's made you and you
[17:16] you so I'm going to see and I've been
[17:23] thinking about a little bit all week
[17:25] they have made the Seventh Seal
[17:27] everything in the book except their self
[17:31] they've made it brother Ram coming back
[17:34] they've made it seven thunders virtues
[17:36] they've made it this person they made it
[17:38] back they put it all out there and
[17:40] that's not words that that's right it's
[17:45] Christ in you the hope of all it's that
[17:47] other immutable thing because remember
[17:51] listen yeah we've got to take a body
[17:54] change and yeah we as human beings we
[17:55] change our mind but I listen if your
[17:58] soul is the soul of God it's immutable
[18:00] but it can't change its mind or we're
[18:05] another person you see what I'm gettin
[18:08] to that's God inside of you so I'm
[18:11] reading this afternoon where brother
[18:13] round talks about the bridegroom and the
[18:15] bride the Scripture speaks of one speaks
[18:17] of the evidence the same identical thing
[18:18] and in Romans eight we just went through
[18:20] we're gonna they said we're heirs and
[18:22] joint heirs with Christ whatever he gets
[18:24] we get okay he got these guy and human
[18:28] flesh so regarding him--as clay that's
[18:31] the whole problem but saying what a
[18:32] saint always do he always points back
[18:34] that way and always points that way
[18:36] memory right but not sure the guy's
[18:39] trying to study here we totally have as
[18:43] an anchor of the soul both sure and
[18:45] steadfast which entered into that within
[18:47] the veil whether the forerunner is for
[18:51] us entered even Jesus made a high priest
[18:53] forever after the order of melchizedek
[18:56] continue reading for this Melchizedek
[18:59] king of Salem priest of the Most High
[19:02] God who met Abraham returning from the
[19:04] slaughter of the Kings and blessed him
[19:05] now remember that was the first
[19:07] which was actually Abram at the time
[19:10] because God has to come to you in your
[19:13] journey of your new birth a broom type
[19:16] justification and sanctification right
[19:19] hey bro
[19:20] type of gentrification in sanctification
[19:23] now Abraham top is wonderful circumcised
[19:26] so Abraham got a name change you've got
[19:29] a name change when you became a
[19:30] Christian then Abraham was circumcised
[19:35] to show that he had come to this place
[19:38] though he didn't come to a new birth but
[19:40] remember it's types he typed the new
[19:42] birth so God met Abram in his
[19:46] justification and sanctification just
[19:47] like what brother Dale was talking about
[19:48] last night Bob study and he'll be
[19:51] talking about this after that no more
[19:53] this morning is that what God's got to
[19:55] do is he's got to come in and do a work
[19:58] of sanctification now that's gone he
[20:01] comes in and he cleans that out it's not
[20:05] the devil the devil never gonna clean
[20:07] you I don't he's gonna kind of fill you
[20:08] up with you and him so what happened in
[20:14] April's journey Abram realized this
[20:18] Melchizedek met him when he got a
[20:22] victory brother Brown said if you'll
[20:23] read a Abraham and something I can't
[20:27] remember the language okay excuse me
[20:30] other title but he's talking about
[20:32] Abraham's journey through justification
[20:35] sanctification told them Abram means
[20:37] mill Cassidy God Almighty human flesh
[20:39] after a victory remember what happened
[20:42] lot got captured by a bunch of kings
[20:45] they took him down into a place and
[20:47] Abram collected his household it was
[20:51] just people in this household wedding
[20:52] with an army he just collected 300 or
[20:56] some people in household and he lived
[20:58] out live when when he came back from the
[21:00] slaughter of the king he didn't just run
[21:03] them out of the country
[21:04] he killed him and blessed him to whom
[21:08] also Abraham this Abram gave a tenth
[21:12] part of all cuz now look you said well
[21:13] what's Paul saying Abraham for probably
[21:16] on this island earning money Paul is
[21:19] writing about Abraham which there was
[21:22] nothing to be put and charged against
[21:24] Abraham when you come through the blood
[21:27] of Jesus Christ you look back and surely
[21:31] Paul being a Bible scholar knew that was
[21:37] a broom but Paul's looking at a finish
[21:41] work Paul is looking through the blood
[21:43] through through Calabrian looking at
[21:45] Abraham not Abram but Abraham finish the
[21:51] journey right and he met Melchizedek
[21:55] after the slaughter of the kings in his
[21:58] walk of justification and sanctification
[22:00] and that's the same thing you and I are
[22:03] going to have to meet God and because
[22:06] listen if you come to a baby for
[22:08] justification then your sins are
[22:10] forgiven who did that
[22:12] the helf did that you can't do it Satan
[22:17] can't do it but God just forgive you
[22:19] your past sins now he didn't go ahead
[22:21] and birth you so there's a process but
[22:23] he's going to but look what look what
[22:25] how gracious God is you you come into
[22:27] the justification that's why I said if
[22:29] you can't see this in your journey then
[22:31] you got to know them that you were
[22:33] justified in fighting in a particular
[22:35] place that you were sanctified in the
[22:37] place and that you get to receive the
[22:39] baptism I hold oh nothing you just come
[22:41] into this message and sit down in a
[22:44] message to you and never had an
[22:45] experience no you better have an
[22:46] experience with Jesus Christ not the way
[22:49] around right then that will take you to
[22:52] the messages and then but a
[22:55] justification we see this past in for
[22:58] chopped-off but remember brother Graham
[23:00] said it does nothing for the old nature
[23:03] it's still in there your soul is still
[23:05] black my brother Dale stole my anointed
[23:08] ones
[23:08] anointed ones can be anointed on their
[23:10] spirit creeps we've seen P
[23:13] in this message preached 40 years and
[23:15] preached seemingly good revelation and
[23:18] find out later on that they've been
[23:20] sleeping with other women and taking
[23:22] money from people and and now they're
[23:24] not the message when when I was back in
[23:26] but still and we all we all look at
[23:31] these things we go how come that happen
[23:33] well there's one thing for sure they
[23:36] were anointed but they didn't have the
[23:40] Holy Ghost to keep them from doing the
[23:41] things that they didn't do wrong okay
[23:43] now listen you can get trapped in some
[23:45] stuff there's a fine line you get
[23:46] trapped in some stuff but you'll quickly
[23:49] brother Brown said you'll quickly repent
[23:51] and quickly get away from get them go
[23:53] away with that so that's what Abram
[23:56] Abram beginning his journey met
[24:00] Melchizedek you will meet the high
[24:03] priest of your confession in your
[24:06] justification in your Saints petition
[24:08] all right if I got that you will meet
[24:11] that person you should know listen if
[24:13] you can't sit down I'm telling you we
[24:14] need to be real clear you need to be
[24:17] able to sit down and go right there it's
[24:20] where I was justified right there is
[24:25] where I got thanked about you don't have
[24:28] to remember the day the hour into place
[24:30] I do but you don't have to and then the
[24:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to
[24:35] understand it that cannot be just an
[24:38] anointing from being sanctified to the
[24:40] Baptist the host is a very very very
[24:44] tricky place to bend so that's where
[24:47] Satan can still work on you because your
[24:49] soul is not redeemed at the
[24:50] sanctification so he can make you think
[24:53] even brother Branham tells us and
[24:55] brother Dale's gonna read this then you
[24:57] become part of a religious order when
[24:59] you're sanctified you want to go to
[25:00] church well then you say the messy
[25:03] Church and say well I believe that women
[25:04] shouldn't cut their hair and we should
[25:06] baptize name Lord Jesus Christ and yeah
[25:08] that but one true and living God well I
[25:09] knew that my sport paint a nice black
[25:11] the second so I know that cause I live
[25:13] through it okay
[25:16] I live through that I could preach it
[25:20] fourteen-years-old better than some
[25:21] people in this messy but I didn't have
[25:25] the hold I knew I didn't because my
[25:28] fruit showed twenty years from their
[25:30] tour twenty years later than I did okay
[25:33] so but now I do remember though when God
[25:36] when I repented
[25:37] I remember when got sanctified emptied
[25:42] me out and then I remember when he
[25:44] filled me up and then the word became
[25:47] alive is what it's telling them by last
[25:48] night those of you that weren't about
[25:50] the state you will know if you can't
[25:54] understand more than you understood
[25:58] twenty years ago everybody sitting in
[25:59] this room has been in this message over
[26:02] 20 years you you're the closest one I
[26:07] would assume maybe usually 20 80 99 this
[26:13] is 20 19 20 years you weren't there to
[26:18] telly so really I mean been dismissed
[26:23] twenty years do you still do you still
[26:25] you still sucked in the bottle you you
[26:29] still you still hung has God not reveal
[26:33] that's the trueness of a new birth the
[26:37] problem with people is and that's why I
[26:39] love that scripture Matthew those who
[26:41] endure to the end shall be saved
[26:43] we keep enduring and we'll keep enduring
[26:45] and sometimes it makes
[26:47] you don't have nothing but you know what
[26:48] you keep coming back you keep coming
[26:50] back you keep coming back and keep
[26:52] coming back you keep coming back and you
[26:54] keep coming back you do the things that
[26:56] God tells you to do and you enjoy doing
[27:01] them that's the big difference you enjoy
[27:05] doing them all right that's the whole
[27:08] thing if you quit enjoying coming to
[27:11] church you don't have a new birth you do
[27:15] not have anybody if you do not enjoy
[27:17] coming to church he
[27:19] oh well it's Sunday I gotta take a
[27:21] set-aside this day to do well you ain't
[27:23] got from your birth program started
[27:26] burning nbelievable will not cannot wait
[27:28] for the doors of the church to open up
[27:29] no no some of you live a long way away a
[27:32] wink tonight which is good because we
[27:33] have the internet to do that win but now
[27:38] sund'ys if you reverence God he'll read
[27:42] what you I promise
[27:44] grab watch him with your time and your
[27:46] offering and and you know what I'm gonna
[27:49] say it right now some of y'all have made
[27:51] one service dinner on Sunday that ain't
[27:53] it
[27:53] brother Graham said when the doors are
[27:55] open you should be a term an entire
[27:57] doors stay open from like 2 o'clock 4
[27:59] o'clock to y'all not like my brakes and
[28:01] then you can dust ok but you just tell
[28:03] me that and then you can leave but like
[28:06] Terry said we saw that some people have
[28:08] on one service on Sunday
[28:09] most people y'all someone go already
[28:11] decided not to have a one service so I'm
[28:17] just telling you the Bible says Ashley
[28:18] see the Day approaching we should more
[28:21] want to be in Turkey that's right right
[28:23] and I'm just reading the Bible I'm not
[28:25] telling what lesson that's your opinion
[28:26] no it's not my thing the Bible says and
[28:29] more as the day approaches we should be
[28:31] minded together and be in church me my
[28:37] people like sister truly there 80 years
[28:39] old Grove sorry 81
[28:44] throw four hours to come to church state
[28:49] both services she had a won't so much
[28:52] since he had a bucket full of excuses
[28:54] she could use she didn't use them then
[28:57] God's honored her because at 81 she's
[28:59] feeling pretty okay so God will honor it
[29:03] but now you say well I got I got
[29:05] problems well staying at home might be
[29:07] your problem
[29:11] but remember Abram my whole point Abram
[29:16] never stopped Abram went on to be
[29:19] Abraham he met Melchizedek twice two
[29:24] times he met him at the slaughter of the
[29:26] kings which is in justification and God
[29:28] is going to meet you and he's going to
[29:30] sanctify justify you and sanctify you
[29:32] but now Abram had to make the journey
[29:35] into Abraham to have a revelation to
[29:42] them all so Abram gave a tenth part of
[29:44] all there's you your tithing first being
[29:46] by interpretation king of righteousness
[29:48] after that also king of Salem which is
[29:51] king of peace now we know who that was
[29:53] that was the often II God Jesus Christ
[29:56] yeah but he was Jesus the theophany but
[29:58] he wasn't the outside man this
[30:00] Melchizedek man around here didn't die
[30:02] for you the flesh he had to come down
[30:06] through wound to be Jesus Christ to be
[30:09] our brother see because we can't be
[30:11] terrible Melchizedek but we can be heir
[30:15] with Jesus Christ a man a man we can't
[30:17] be animal Melchizedek though he'd be the
[30:19] high priest though he'd be the one that
[30:21] that takes and and heals your diseases
[30:24] and all these things but he cannot be
[30:26] your Savior this Melchizedek could not
[30:28] he had to become both crimes that he
[30:30] became Jesus Christ right and then now
[30:33] now listen and I'm gonna say this one
[30:36] more time the reason we can understand
[30:40] and the reason you and I can get
[30:42] revelation is because that man that
[30:45] wrote these words through these prophets
[30:48] is Lee
[30:49] than you today he's looking through your
[30:53] eyes
[30:54] reading hornies already but he's already
[30:57] wrote and if that doesn't become real to
[30:59] you then you need to get the new birth
[31:00] because the new birth is the birth of
[31:02] the word that you read it's a bird it
[31:06] bursts you into where you don't like we
[31:09] have for 50 years we have been second
[31:12] persons
[31:14] well there's God and we can't get to him
[31:17] because he's this great thing and then
[31:19] he's over there saying I'm this great
[31:20] dog but now I'm inside of you see even
[31:27] but no we have to have the faith of
[31:29] Abraham because look Abraham did not
[31:31] have the new birth he didn't have a man
[31:33] inside teacher he didn't have the Holy
[31:36] Ghost in his self he had an anointing
[31:39] just like an anointed one but it was a
[31:42] true anointing of God to carry him
[31:44] through that journey okay there's no one
[31:46] in you text Old Testament you know that
[31:48] no one in the New Testament had a new
[31:49] birth though the testator died Jesus had
[31:52] to die even John the Baptist did not
[31:54] have the new birth all right until Jesus
[31:57] died no one had a new birth by the hand
[32:00] an anointing all through the Old
[32:01] Testament that was an anointing that was
[32:03] the Christ that was above the people
[32:07] then he came to be with us and now he
[32:10] came to become the begin us now that
[32:11] part we were getting more even after 50
[32:14] years we're trying to understand that
[32:16] that Christ is in us even though Paul
[32:19] roads if Christ in you the hope of glory
[32:21] we still think that's a second person or
[32:24] another
[32:27] [Music]
[32:29] we're missing something when we think
[32:32] that that we're not you say are you good
[32:35] are you as good as God no I'm as good as
[32:37] God made me and if he made me good then
[32:41] I gotta throw it back than him right if
[32:43] I'm Harrison Jordan and I throw it back
[32:45] to him say hey you know what I said this
[32:47] right and you know what our actions will
[32:50] show that we went absolutely this is the
[32:53] day of Revelation if you and I are the
[32:55] midstream we have to be revealed then we
[32:57] definitely are going to be made known so
[33:01] this King of this Melchizedek was a
[33:05] person and many people think that not a
[33:08] messy book with that clarity by brother
[33:10] Branham tell us it was a person it was
[33:13] the theophany of God is this Melchizedek
[33:17] because it says without father without
[33:19] mother without descent who is that about
[33:22] the Christ Jesus Christ the Christ
[33:26] alright because Jesus did have a mother
[33:28] a birthing mother all right without
[33:32] descent having neither beginning of days
[33:35] nor end of life but made like unto the
[33:39] Son of God abideth the priest
[33:41] continually now consider how great this
[33:45] man was brother Brennan many times you
[33:48] know he was do with denominational
[33:50] people that believe that that was just
[33:51] in a warrior just a priest today but
[33:54] brother Brown says he daddy the Bible
[33:56] said he was a man okay until whom even
[34:00] the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of
[34:03] the spoil and barely they that of the
[34:06] sons of Levi who received the office of
[34:08] the priesthood that's what we're talking
[34:10] about couple Sundays ago Levi was the
[34:13] Levitical priesthood Levi Levitical
[34:15] priesthood right he was in the loins of
[34:18] Abraham which was his great-grandfather
[34:21] he paid time they didn't literally pay
[34:24] time but what happened when he come out
[34:26] of it when that lineage come out of
[34:28] Abraham he paid tithes we were talking
[34:32] not too long
[34:32] remember preachers should pay tithe
[34:36] they're not exempt even the Levi's if
[34:41] you'll keep going in the Bible the
[34:42] Levi's pay the tithe back into the into
[34:45] the I guess you might say the Treasury
[34:50] and that's what I said what brother Dale
[34:53] does brother Dale takes the tithe he
[34:56] takes a salary he takes that money and
[34:59] he pays it right back into the church
[35:00] his 10% and what that 10% does it
[35:03] accumulates and he brings people in to
[35:06] preach and pays these creatures when you
[35:09] get paid to preach that that comes from
[35:11] his piloting coming back to know you I
[35:14] promise you you come by Daniel Stamm
[35:16] beliefs being a shin kicker that's a
[35:18] shame kicker in a message to because
[35:19] most most message preachers don't think
[35:23] well fly one said did brother day over 1
[35:26] times the food iPad 2 great we all no
[35:34] one is exempt from vampire no one okay
[35:39] barely pay there are the sons of Levi
[35:42] who received the office of the
[35:43] priesthood have a commandment to take
[35:45] tithes of the people which is a
[35:46] commandment it is a commandment that you
[35:49] pay time and if you don't you break in
[35:51] the commandment and that's why you
[35:55] stroke kind of interesting you can tell
[35:59] people that don't really pay a lot of
[36:01] time for the struggle
[36:05] don't take any discernment for that
[36:07] right have a commandment to take tithes
[36:10] of the people according to the law that
[36:12] is of their brethren though they come
[36:14] out of the ones of Abraham but he whose
[36:17] descent is not counted from them receive
[36:20] tithes of Abraham and blessed him that
[36:24] had the promises so it's the blessing we
[36:26] know that and without all contradiction
[36:29] the less is blessed of the better in
[36:33] other words what's Paul saying without
[36:35] contradiction you will be blessed if you
[36:37] do these things you'll be blessed of the
[36:40] better these two but who's the better of
[36:41] Jesus Christ our God and you're the
[36:44] lesser so you're the one that's going to
[36:45] be blessed by doing these things and
[36:49] here men that die receive tithes but
[36:52] there he receiveth them of whom it is
[36:56] witness that he liveth you understand
[37:00] what I'm saying him men to die in other
[37:02] words the priest of the natural
[37:04] priesthood but there he receiveth them
[37:06] of whom in his witness that he liveth
[37:08] and as I may say also leave I also do
[37:11] receiveth I've paid tithes in Abraham so
[37:17] that's where you your room scriptures
[37:19] playing about fan ties everybody based
[37:21] on where he was getting the ones of his
[37:24] father when Melchizedek many if
[37:27] therefore perfection were by the
[37:29] Levitical priesthood we know it's not
[37:31] all the Levi's they were set up as an
[37:35] order to do the priestly things but they
[37:39] never saved one person no I was saying
[37:44] in the Old Testament no one so what they
[37:49] did is they just did what God told them
[37:51] to do and God covered their sin I told
[37:54] the next year and then what he had to go
[37:55] back in and cover their sin again you
[37:57] have to go back we'll cover that in
[37:58] revelation 6 because if that blood would
[38:01] have been sufficient they would have had
[38:02] the only went one time and it have been
[38:04] all done so what had done was it just
[38:06] covered our the word Capo it just
[38:09] covered they're saying
[38:10] until calibrating them when Jesus shed
[38:12] his blood it took care of those things
[38:14] right so by the Levitical priesthood
[38:18] no one was perfected therefore
[38:21] perfection were if if therefore
[38:23] perfection were by the Levitical
[38:24] priesthood
[38:25] now he's interpolating for an Andrea the
[38:28] people received the law they had to do
[38:30] that to live in Levitical priesthood had
[38:32] to be there what further need was there
[38:35] that another priest should ride after
[38:38] the order of Melchizedek in other words
[38:39] minded Christ's have to come and this
[38:41] was sufficient if the blood of bulls and
[38:43] goats was sufficient why did Christ have
[38:45] to come because the blood of bulls and
[38:47] ghost was the substitute that was a
[38:49] human life I mean I'm sorry that was a
[38:51] nature life that when it went away it
[38:54] just meant we needed somebody to die
[38:58] that could release a life that could
[39:00] come back inside of me and clean me up
[39:02] and that's what Christ only Christ could
[39:05] do better right so that's so that it's
[39:09] so profound but it's so simple how that
[39:11] all works it was a substitute until
[39:15] Christ came itself but it that would be
[39:19] what further need was there then another
[39:21] priest should rise after the order of
[39:25] Melchizedek and not be calling after the
[39:27] order of Aaron for the priesthood being
[39:30] changed there is made of necessity a
[39:34] change also of the law for he of whom
[39:38] these things are spoken for 10 to the
[39:41] know the tribe of which no man gave of
[39:43] 10 that said the author he understand
[39:45] what he's saying okay Jesus Christ did
[39:48] not come from the Levitical priesthood
[39:50] he came from the tribe of Judah so it
[39:54] says for he Christ of whom these things
[39:59] are spoken pertaining to another tribe
[40:02] he stomach the Levitical tribal abetik
[40:05] Levitical now he's saying this person
[40:09] then come of which no man gave
[40:12] attendance at the altar in other words
[40:14] Judah did
[40:15] to do with the washing the pots and
[40:18] doing the sacrifices Christ came from
[40:21] the tribe of juda you would think you'd
[40:22] come from Levi but remember Jesus had to
[40:28] come under the law and Judah was the
[40:30] lawgiver right for it is evident that
[40:35] our Lord sprang out of Judah that
[40:37] answered your question
[40:40] excuse me know which try Moses spake
[40:42] nothing concerning priesthood see if you
[40:47] just would have come to caucus and
[40:49] tsukasa
[40:50] I come from the tribal Eva I come from a
[40:54] little bit of a priesthood conference
[40:57] what it said my side the Bible tells
[41:00] it's going to come from from in other
[41:03] words that come from between the legs of
[41:05] Judith what it said really what it said
[41:06] come out from spring from Judah but now
[41:11] remember Jesus didn't come really from
[41:13] the tribe of Judah Joseph came from the
[41:15] crowd you did okay and he had nothing to
[41:18] do but you still gotta run your types
[41:21] you got to see that he did come out he
[41:22] was the Lion of the tribe of Judah so he
[41:26] didn't come anyway that they told it
[41:28] said he would be coming so they didn't
[41:30] think it was Christ they think it was
[41:31] Jesus Christ other thing for the Lord
[41:34] sprang out of Judah of which crime oh
[41:36] just paid nothing concerning priesthood
[41:39] and it is yet far more evident for that
[41:43] after the symbol to to Melchizedek there
[41:46] arose another priest simple to all right
[41:50] our likeness I guess you can say that
[41:52] let's look at what foot
[41:53] just like this all right a milk as it
[41:57] arises another creeps who has made not
[42:00] after the law carnal commandment now
[42:02] look all other priests came carnally by
[42:07] man and woman okay except this one Jesus
[42:15] Christ who is made not after the law
[42:18] carnal commandment our normal human
[42:22] doings but after the power and endless
[42:25] life what we come here and have to
[42:28] receive the new birth like we've talked
[42:30] about last night that all those couple
[42:33] birds that we were talking about you
[42:34] know you you see these people in the
[42:37] message then you know they were born
[42:38] with eternal life and all this was it's
[42:40] the eternal seed well brother brown says
[42:43] you would these that you were born to
[42:45] cook of Earth and you had to be changed
[42:47] into a week okay they don't read them
[42:50] I've never I've never seen anybody even
[42:52] read those quotes they just bury them
[42:53] underneath the pile you know but you
[42:56] know what it's our job to pull them out
[42:57] put them on top all right mmm but after
[43:02] the power and in this life in other
[43:03] words Jesus came here with each our life
[43:05] and you did not he did but now we
[43:09] receive eternal life and it's the same
[43:10] eternal life he had so it's not through
[43:12] definite eternal life I don't see how we
[43:16] don't I don't see how that's why I said
[43:18] the new birth birth through the new
[43:19] birth is the most real prompting and
[43:22] even when he said that 50 60 years ago
[43:25] he says one of the most the old crop
[43:26] subject because he had the bag to stay
[43:29] in just shake a hand he had the
[43:31] Pentecostal saying you gotta shout vegan
[43:33] tongue you had to master this you hadn't
[43:35] do this you had all these different ones
[43:36] and man has just taught so scattered but
