[0:02] you're in the dentist
[0:10] here in the dentist
[0:12] oh
[0:17] peace is in a dentist office
[0:24] they give you gas or something they must
[0:26] they must pay her out
[0:31] they must when you sign in there's
[0:33] something in the pen that starts giving
[0:35] you drugs if you think that's a common
[0:39] experience wow
[0:51] all right well
[0:53] let's talk about faith though sure sure
[0:56] sister Trudy must have a lot of faith in
[0:58] the dentist
[1:01] because
[1:03] okay all right
[1:06] now we're officially your coordinate all
[1:10] right good morning we'll get started
[1:12] just a little bit early
[1:14] now I want everybody to understand we've
[1:16] come to a place in the Statue of a
[1:17] perfect Amanda we're going to start
[1:19] talking about faith and faith is the new
[1:21] birth we've been talking about that
[1:23] before but let's
[1:25] let's today
[1:27] you know let's just put a nail in it and
[1:30] because if you don't if you if it's not
[1:33] in concrete this Foundation is is in
[1:36] concrete it's reinforced you know even
[1:39] the walls are reinforced
[1:41] and that
[1:43] keeps this building from falling down
[1:45] it's because the foundation was done
[1:47] correctly so if we do our foundation
[1:49] correctly and all of our foundations
[1:51] should be absolutely on faith
[1:54] faith not in yourself right right
[1:58] you know the world of taste it we'll
[2:00] have faith in yourself and I agree with
[2:01] that be positive have faith that you can
[2:04] do it worldly things you know your job
[2:07] and stuff like that but still as
[2:08] Christians we have to believe that we
[2:10] have faith that God is has a hand in
[2:13] everything that we do
[2:15] so we have to put our faith in back on
[2:17] him
[2:18] that he's the one who can do it because
[2:20] remember by yourself we're going to
[2:22] bounce up by ourselves we're going to
[2:24] make mistakes
[2:25] by ourselves we're not going to ever be
[2:28] good enough
[2:31] and I think that's a problem with a lot
[2:33] of us
[2:34] in here and in the church and I mean
[2:37] Church all over message churches
[2:39] is that
[2:41] we're not seeing
[2:44] you know we're not seeing great signs
[2:46] and wonders are great you know as far as
[2:48] what we I don't our expectation may be
[2:50] way up here but you got to remember one
[2:53] thing
[2:55] God is still here
[2:58] God is no more weak than he was that's
[3:02] right when he walked on the shores of
[3:03] Galilee
[3:05] it's just that we have to become that
[3:07] Temple that he can work through because
[3:09] he cannot work through anything else you
[3:12] say cannot yes because he chose to work
[3:14] through man
[3:16] he didn't choose to work through animals
[3:17] he'd choose to work through trees he
[3:19] didn't choose to work through uh cars or
[3:22] or even of the economy
[3:27] he didn't choose to do that
[3:29] he choose to do it through an individual
[3:31] men and women
[3:33] that he brought here on this Earth
[3:34] predestinated
[3:37] okay but you had to come down here to
[3:39] make a choice
[3:41] this is the part of you being here
[3:44] is the choice you have to make it's like
[3:46] brother Keith Ray were talking about
[3:48] last night
[3:49] choices
[3:51] look at all the examples that brother
[3:54] random gave about the prostitutes or the
[3:56] or
[3:57] um what was her name I told you last
[4:00] night Rosella remembered Rosella was a
[4:03] drunk and a mental institution
[4:06] she was a prostitute
[4:09] and brother Graham said look at her now
[4:10] she's winning sold for the Lord
[4:13] well she got over
[4:16] goodbye God's help she got over being
[4:18] what the choice she had made but the
[4:20] consequence was she was in that insane
[4:22] asylum and nobody could help her
[4:25] but brother random went there and helped
[4:28] her
[4:28] got down into the soul of the person not
[4:31] just the emotional part or the see
[4:33] that's what Alcoholics Anonymous does
[4:35] and that's what uh Reformation does it
[4:38] reforms you
[4:40] Alcoholics Anonymous is once an
[4:42] alcoholic always an alcoholic
[4:44] so stay away from it don't ever touch it
[4:46] don't ever get well become a Christian
[4:49] become a born-again Christian and that
[4:52] doesn't reform you that restores you
[4:55] restoration is bringing you back to
[4:57] where you didn't like that stuff to
[4:59] start with
[5:00] okay never understand what I'm saying
[5:02] that's where you can and you can't put
[5:04] all that
[5:06] I'm going to try to take a bunch of
[5:08] examples Maybe not today and we're going
[5:10] to put them together because
[5:12] individually that doesn't mean you're
[5:13] born again
[5:15] you can just have a good thought or or
[5:18] you have a strong will to quit something
[5:22] yes
[5:24] that's just Alcoholics Anonymous that's
[5:26] Reformation
[5:27] but to restore you is restoring the
[5:30] whole person that's why I believe
[5:31] brother random had to come and preach
[5:32] the statue of a perfect man to show that
[5:35] God can and will
[5:38] restore not reform restore a group of
[5:40] people back to a position
[5:45] because he wants like a priest the other
[5:46] day on the glorification there's two
[5:48] glorifications there's one down here at
[5:50] the bottom of the pyramid When God says
[5:53] this is my beloved Son and whom I'm
[5:54] pleased to dwell and then there's
[5:55] another glorification because he said
[5:57] I'll glorify it now and I'll glorify it
[5:59] again what through the son of man which
[6:02] is the word made flesh and that's what
[6:04] you and R you and I are are the word
[6:07] made flesh all right we got to start
[6:09] believing that that even our flesh
[6:14] has to yield to what's inside of us
[6:18] we've got to see that this flesh is
[6:21] nothing more than a shell
[6:22] it's a it's a
[6:25] um
[6:26] framework
[6:28] something that when your Mom and Daddy
[6:30] got together there was a DNA of this
[6:33] germ and the DNA of this germ and they
[6:35] come together
[6:36] and they formed a life
[6:40] the egg created the body right
[6:44] the egg from the female which is a very
[6:46] wonderful type of the word of God
[6:48] because
[6:49] the father is the only one that has seed
[6:52] you understand what I mean let's talk
[6:54] natural for just a second father's gonna
[6:55] want to have seed so I'm trying to build
[6:57] your faith how do you got here and how
[6:59] that God's going to build you up so you
[7:01] don't have you that baby don't have seed
[7:05] the baby is C
[7:07] the father has a seed the the sperm
[7:10] right unless it connects with the female
[7:16] it's not it's just that it's there's no
[7:18] there's no connection to it
[7:20] so you didn't come here with a seed in
[7:23] you
[7:25] yes your father had to see
[7:28] and when it connected with the mother
[7:30] which the Bible says the mother is the
[7:32] word of God
[7:36] and even the Bible says the seed is a
[7:38] word so you have to put them both
[7:39] together it's the word quickening the
[7:42] word
[7:43] because remember and and I want to give
[7:45] you the quote where brother Brown said
[7:47] it's not the person that comes
[7:48] predestinated eternally from God but the
[7:51] seed or word
[7:52] so it's not the person that comes it's
[7:54] not the Gwen solace
[7:56] or what you wanted before
[7:58] Brown
[7:59] didn't come because I'm going back to
[8:02] before she was married it did not
[8:04] produce a child of God It produced a
[8:07] child of the Browns
[8:11] given us all by God
[8:13] yes perfect
[8:15] and then Satan comes in and perverts it
[8:19] but he can't create a song He perverts
[8:22] that Soul gives it a fallen nature now
[8:25] if you don't get rid of that that thing
[8:27] permeates that Soul so much so like what
[8:29] blackens it out
[8:32] Darkness it can't grow
[8:35] but it's not a seed of God in you
[8:38] as in the baptism of the Holy Ghost as
[8:41] in the new birth
[8:42] I believe you have to receive that but
[8:44] where does it come from
[8:46] your daddy
[8:49] comes to your mama
[8:52] right and then that is what is quicker
[8:55] than you are planted in you you don't
[8:57] have this
[8:59] eternal germ you have an eternal
[9:01] representation
[9:03] you're represented eternally from God
[9:06] and and to a trained audience you can
[9:09] say you was born with eternal life
[9:10] because potentially somewhere if you
[9:13] were ever going to have it God put it
[9:14] somewhere but he put it in the word
[9:16] right he's got to be a choice that you
[9:19] make
[9:20] everybody understand that's a choice God
[9:23] knew what choice you made but you didn't
[9:26] had there been no fall we would have
[9:28] come just completely perfect
[9:31] any way you look at it we would have
[9:33] come the spoken word is the Original
[9:35] Seed so it was spoken word from the
[9:38] beginning and it's got to go back to
[9:40] spoken word now right in between there
[9:45] was a fall
[9:46] that's why this had to come brother
[9:49] Brown said God let you come down in this
[9:51] to make your choice
[9:53] he knew what choice you'd make if you're
[9:55] born again
[9:57] if you're born again truly born again
[9:58] you know what George you're going to
[10:00] make because you made that choice
[10:01] am I understand that pretty simple but
[10:04] very complex but I don't want you to see
[10:06] one I want you to see one thing that you
[10:08] have to live by faith not that God has
[10:10] already placed something in you and you
[10:13] have nothing to do and and obviously you
[10:16] don't didn't have a thing to get
[10:17] yourself you know had nothing to do with
[10:20] getting yourself here
[10:21] we know that that was Divine Providence
[10:24] but God knowing when you've got here
[10:28] that you would desire it more than life
[10:30] itself he brought you him
[10:33] why that he could he could bring other
[10:35] people that will never be able to come
[10:38] to
[10:39] to eternal life because he knew if Adolf
[10:41] Hitler lived a million years
[10:43] he would never come and never get on his
[10:46] knees and say God I'm sorry for what I
[10:48] did okay
[10:50] so therefore I can see predestination
[10:53] because this is being predetermined by
[10:56] God
[10:56] this is predetermined there's nothing
[10:59] you can do about it but you do when you
[11:01] get here though you get here to make a
[11:04] choice and then when we make it's not
[11:06] just making that choice
[11:08] it's then we got to take these virtues
[11:10] and let them come back out
[11:12] okay
[11:18] well see people take the quote where
[11:20] brother Brown said to you all what you
[11:22] know
[11:23] you were seed
[11:25] that's how you can be reborn well that's
[11:27] right because it was in here it wasn't
[11:28] in you right right the Bible says the
[11:32] seed is the word of God
[11:35] and you were not born word first
[11:39] Jesus was born word first right because
[11:42] he comes straight from God the germ was
[11:45] from God or the sperm was from God and
[11:48] the Egg was from God so man had nothing
[11:50] to do with that he comes straight from
[11:53] God that's why he could say before
[11:54] Abraham was I am you can't say that
[11:56] you can say that by the inside man
[11:58] that's right you say way before that
[12:01] but see you can't say that outwardly
[12:04] because it stumbles people
[12:06] we got to be really mature
[12:09] to sometimes talk about this
[12:12] but I don't want I'd rather I'd rather
[12:14] be so immature
[12:16] that we understand we got to be born
[12:17] again
[12:19] we understand that we've got to have
[12:21] something to do you say oh we got
[12:23] nothing to do with you got to say yes or
[12:25] no
[12:26] Eve made a choice Jesus she said yes she
[12:29] could have said no
[12:31] she could have said no and got behind
[12:32] her husband and that would have been it
[12:34] but she made a choice Cain made a choice
[12:37] every person has been on the face of
[12:39] this Earth that has come to the age of
[12:41] accountability has made a choice
[12:44] so that way God that way Adolf Hitler
[12:46] can't come up and say God you created me
[12:49] this way why are you sending me to hell
[12:50] and sending this person to heaven
[12:53] God said one day I came to you because
[12:56] he come from a religious family he was
[12:58] part of you
[12:59] so
[13:01] why didn't he he said because what you
[13:03] chose
[13:04] I gave it to you right here I believe
[13:06] he'll tell every person on the face of
[13:07] this Earth that's come to the age of
[13:09] accountability
[13:10] he'll say I tried to contact you right
[13:13] here and that person is going to have to
[13:15] remember that because like Peter said
[13:17] yesterday he said there's a time where
[13:19] you that every one of them that run
[13:21] around related those questions they took
[13:24] him back to the very spot remember even
[13:25] the soldier that the priest said you
[13:28] need to go find God where you left him
[13:29] and he said now lay me down to sleep
[13:31] well he knew right then where he left
[13:33] God
[13:33] so you'll go right back to where you
[13:36] left God and it'll be quick into your
[13:38] mind and you'll say okay well see then
[13:40] there's the Judgment then you walk away
[13:48] from the Bible but whatever took place
[13:51] during this time
[13:53] that's right absolutely same way with us
[13:57] same way with you and I so that's what
[14:00] we respond to it's like a little quote
[14:02] that I made a long time ago when I was
[14:04] preaching a sermon it's it's God knew
[14:07] what part of the Bible you would need
[14:09] and he had it right here
[14:11] knowing that one day you would respond
[14:13] to that part of that Bible you responded
[14:16] to some part of this you didn't respond
[14:17] to Greer's Almanac or or you know
[14:21] modern day for living and all no he
[14:24] didn't respond to that you responded to
[14:25] somebody
[14:27] somebody read a scripture and preached a
[14:30] sermon or somebody talked about God well
[14:32] where's God in order
[14:35] and then that quickens something in your
[14:37] heart and you didn't relate back to that
[14:39] person
[14:40] you related back to the scripture
[14:43] all right
[14:45] no I'm good no not one
[14:48] but be there for perfect
[14:50] I can see both
[14:52] you got to come to an altar and it's
[14:55] it's hard to read in in the in the
[14:58] message of the hour because brother Ryan
[14:59] would say I've got one book at home and
[15:01] I probably since I put it up moving my
[15:03] stuff but
[15:04] you can flip the book open and I can't
[15:06] remember the name of it right here on
[15:08] top of the page it says you were not
[15:10] born on any certain day you always was
[15:13] eternal then right down here at your
[15:14] very bottom he's calling an altar call
[15:17] and he says your eternal life starts at
[15:19] the altar all right now he's not
[15:22] confused
[15:24] he's up here in the mind of God and he's
[15:27] down here talking to people
[15:29] does everybody get that Kathy didn't
[15:31] because I see the pearls in her brain in
[15:33] her face
[15:34] well see in the mind of God you always
[15:36] will return that's right right if he
[15:39] sees one sin of yours you're a goner
[15:42] just put it in my term you're you're out
[15:44] of here so if you have eternal life that
[15:48] part of eternal life on this page he's
[15:50] preaching always was eternal
[15:53] you never was born on any certain day
[15:58] that's because this was right here the
[16:01] Bible the word of God was here for you
[16:03] before you got here not after you got
[16:07] here before you got him that's right
[16:09] okay so here we go let me let me finish
[16:11] with Texas okay right here eternal life
[16:14] brother right on the same because like I
[16:15] said one time before brother Brown is
[16:17] preaching to an audience
[16:19] and he goes into the mind of God and if
[16:21] they're born again he sees nothing but
[16:24] eternal life
[16:26] purity
[16:27] no certain day you were born no no you
[16:30] know you always were Eternal you were
[16:33] this eternal seed of God true
[16:36] but now when he comes down and starts
[16:38] preaching to humanity same sermon
[16:41] he's preaching to the people that are
[16:43] sinners
[16:44] and he can see that he's a prophet he
[16:47] can see the light of the dark or the
[16:48] light of the dark
[16:51] well the lice already got the light they
[16:53] don't need it no more
[16:55] but the dark he sees on the people and
[16:58] he says
[17:00] eternal life starts down here at the
[17:01] altar you need to come down here
[17:05] to receive
[17:06] eternal life those that already had it
[17:09] didn't need it no more
[17:10] everybody understand that those are out
[17:13] there didn't need internal life no more
[17:17] so I just like to preach everybody like
[17:19] the brothers they preach everybody lost
[17:22] and then let you make the choice
[17:26] because if we started preaching right
[17:28] now that you always was eternal you
[17:29] never was
[17:31] um lost you never you you didn't need to
[17:33] do this you didn't need to do that you
[17:34] just need to believe the message and
[17:36] come to church
[17:37] we just have a bunch of rotten centers
[17:39] we feel this church full we'd have to
[17:41] build another one that's for sure
[17:44] but I thank God we're not doing that but
[17:47] we have preachers in a message that do
[17:48] preach that
[17:50] all you got to do is just believe
[17:51] believe the message believe what
[17:55] the Bible says believe it
[17:57] you got to keep believing that's right
[18:05] we can't have a beginning
[18:08] it can't happen again
[18:12] that's where brother I don't could say
[18:14] you weren't born on any certain day born
[18:16] again
[18:18] because in the mind of God
[18:21] this is permissive and he only looks
[18:23] through the blood he can't see this that
[18:25] we're doing right now you know what the
[18:27] prophet said the bumper blood covers the
[18:30] earth and he looks and sees the blood
[18:31] and that's all he sees
[18:33] he doesn't see through that
[18:36] okay so in the mind of God
[18:39] Ryan had no day he began because Ryan
[18:42] was always in his mind in Genesis 1 26
[18:45] and 27 that man didn't develop in
[18:47] Genesis 1 26 it was written so that we
[18:50] could understand that at a point in time
[18:52] there was something set aside
[18:55] called God
[18:57] big God
[18:59] that was set aside that would come later
[19:03] so that's what will happen that's what
[19:04] happened if Adam and Eve would have not
[19:06] Fallen that Genesis 1 26 and 27 we would
[19:09] have just started coming coming forward
[19:11] but now that we're in this
[19:15] to make him go
[19:17] down across
[19:19] my sins made him go down across he
[19:21] didn't have to right did he have to no
[19:24] he didn't have to go down he went and
[19:26] died knowing we were lost
[19:29] how can you have an eternal seed in if
[19:31] you're lost
[19:34] you have a representation
[19:36] that you'll come to it
[19:39] but uh you know the Bible says God will
[19:41] dwell in an unclean vessel
[19:44] now I don't know where you get that and
[19:45] then the Bible also says the unclean
[19:48] Spirit goes out of a person
[19:51] so it was in there so God and God and
[19:55] the devil can't reside in the same place
[19:56] at the same time
[19:58] so God gave us a life
[20:02] and we were by Nature by Nature I'm
[20:05] hoping scripture Paul says by nature of
[20:07] the children of Wrath
[20:08] as others so see that puts us right here
[20:11] with the sinners
[20:13] not way up there
[20:14] right here as others remember I read
[20:17] through the scripture that time where he
[20:18] says whoremongers and revilers and all
[20:20] that Paul just was naming this whole
[20:22] congregation he said such for some of
[20:23] you
[20:24] but you're washed
[20:26] right no he should have said you always
[20:28] was eternal what's your problem you
[20:30] don't have to repent you always want you
[20:31] always was what a liar or a thief or a
[20:34] golfer
[20:36] no you have to come to a knowledge and
[20:37] that's what we're going to talk about
[20:38] with faith maybe just for a few minutes
[20:41] but let me answer
[20:43] if God can reveal to us
[20:46] because Jesus said before Abraham was I
[20:50] am but we know that flesh right
[20:55] you see that difference
[20:57] that's correct that's right
[21:00] that flash of Jesus had a beginning
[21:03] it was the sacrifice
[21:06] it was the sacrificial lamb right
[21:10] but now Isaiah 53 didn't say he gave his
[21:14] body an offering for sin
[21:19] his body was a sacrifice his soul was
[21:22] the offering
[21:25] that's what I wasaiah 53 says
[21:28] he didn't say he gave us flashing
[21:29] offering for sin he gave his flesh as a
[21:32] sacrifice that was a sacrificial lamb
[21:34] that they brought up without spot or
[21:35] blemish
[21:38] because remember buy your stripes he's
[21:40] healed that has no condition of
[21:41] Christianity
[21:43] right proved for our iniquity and all
[21:46] those things that has no condition for
[21:47] Christianity boom he gave his soul a
[21:50] ransom to get your soul out
[21:54] that was the man
[21:57] that was the man that was the very soul
[21:59] of almighty God
[22:00] so Jesus the flesh was a sacrifice
[22:03] there's no condition of being healed and
[22:05] you have to be a Christian
[22:08] but if he gives his soul for your soul
[22:12] there's
[22:13] the Redemption he redeemed your soul
[22:18] he renames that soul
[22:20] and that's what he went to hell for
[22:21] remember he went to hell in his soul he
[22:24] went to hell to preach to the souls in
[22:25] prison and you and I were in Saul in his
[22:29] soul he was at Genesis 1 26 and 27 man
[22:33] right
[22:36] and see how preachers say well Jesus
[22:38] Jesus just came to uh to tell us we were
[22:41] wrong and then to realize that we always
[22:43] was eternal
[22:45] well then he should have told Nicodemus
[22:47] he should have said Nicodemus
[22:49] he always was eternal just just come on
[22:51] and join me and we'll all be happy and
[22:55] no I found what he said he said you must
[22:57] be something different than what you are
[23:00] now
[23:01] right you must be born from above not
[23:05] from down here that's right this is
[23:08] where our problem is but we've got to
[23:10] have faith and it goes back to just
[23:12] simple faith that Jesus Christ died for
[23:16] your sins on the cross your sins not
[23:18] brother Dale that's not mine up he died
[23:21] for your sin
[23:23] he went up there with you in his mind
[23:26] I'm going to redeem
[23:28] done
[23:31] that's what I believe he walked up there
[23:33] and got on that cross and said I'm going
[23:35] to redeem way devil
[23:36] that's what I'm there for
[23:39] but he's got to come to a place because
[23:41] you know what that light was inside that
[23:43] man
[23:45] eternal life was inside Jesus Christ
[23:47] right
[23:49] in that shell of a human
[23:51] the sacrifice
[23:54] but when the blood cell was broken it
[23:56] released the life out of that sacrifice
[23:59] because remember that was a type in the
[24:01] Old Testament when that life left that
[24:04] animal
[24:05] remember the blood was a covering but
[24:08] couldn't that life of that animal
[24:10] couldn't come into that man and make him
[24:12] quit doing what he was doing
[24:17] but when Jesus came it was human life
[24:20] it was a human life he gave so that
[24:22] human life that he gave
[24:24] was able to not only cover the sand
[24:27] but to totally do away with it because
[24:29] he came back and become the stimulus one
[24:32] when he comes in you he makes you a
[24:34] sandwich one
[24:36] inside
[24:38] but we gotta fight the outside guy
[24:40] that's why it's a stat drove a perfect
[24:41] man right which starts by faith so let's
[24:44] read chapter 11. but I want you to
[24:47] understand you've got you have got to
[24:49] come to a realization that one day you
[24:52] heard sure you heard from your theophany
[24:54] theophany word body
[24:57] word body theophany is a word body not a
[25:01] body your mom and daddy gave you it's a
[25:03] word body
[25:04] and you were not born word
[25:08] you were born lost
[25:12] Doom on your way to Hell a liar yes
[25:17] I've got too much Bible that says I was
[25:19] that
[25:20] they had to take one quote where program
[25:21] said John you always loved Eternal and
[25:23] you never was born on any certain day
[25:25] that's the mind of God talking to you
[25:28] don't understand what I'm saying because
[25:30] remember there's a lot of times we get
[25:32] in ourself
[25:33] yes all of us not just preachers we all
[25:36] get in ourselves and we say things that
[25:39] maybe we shouldn't say yes but now when
[25:41] it comes from God and you and you
[25:43] respond and the preacher is preaching
[25:45] the word of God and you respond to the
[25:47] word of God and you and there's a
[25:49] something just clicks inside that's God
[25:52] talking to you
[25:53] so we may go up here this afternoon or
[25:55] this morning
[25:56] and daddy preached something and I've
[25:58] heard 75 times
[26:01] you too you've heard it long after a lot
[26:03] of you've been with him overnight okay
[26:07] but something clicks
[26:09] something clicked
[26:12] and you say I've never seen that before
[26:14] well Daddy Mass added 150 times
[26:18] why it wasn't time for that to quicken
[26:21] in you
[26:22] you had to come to a place of
[26:25] expectation
[26:28] you trigger this whole thing amen you're
[26:31] the hole trigger whether you get
[26:33] anything up here down here any anything
[26:34] you're the key
[26:38] because God will
[26:39] use a preacher like I said we're
[26:41] servants
[26:42] we're just a conduit we're a pipe
[26:45] and if God needs to go and move that
[26:48] pipe over this way to your way I mean
[26:50] how many times you've been sitting in a
[26:51] sermon
[26:53] and he's like man I ain't getting
[26:54] nothing out of this
[26:57] but somebody right over here about three
[26:59] pews from you is absolutely about to
[27:02] jump out of their seat why because they
[27:05] responded to what the word of God was
[27:07] for their time maybe it wasn't your time
[27:10] yet and we can all Rejoice but there's a
[27:13] time when you've got to lay it down in
[27:15] the word and say this is where it come
[27:16] from right here
[27:18] and this is where I heard it and I
[27:20] believe it that's why it says now Faith
[27:22] is the substance now things hoped for
[27:25] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[27:29] for by it what by faith the elders
[27:33] obtained a good report
[27:36] through faith we understand that the
[27:38] worlds were framed by the word of God
[27:42] or the seed of God everything comes from
[27:44] seed I mean that's just the way life is
[27:47] everything comes from seed right
[27:50] thank you
[27:52] so that things which are seen
[27:55] in other words be hell
[27:58] were not made
[27:59] by things which do appear
[28:01] see we take iron and metal and plastic
[28:04] and rubber and we put a car together
[28:05] well you can see the iron in plastic
[28:07] metal and rubber
[28:10] God made this from zero
[28:14] so I gotta have faith that if that God
[28:17] can make something from zero
[28:19] he can make something from zero
[28:22] he can take him blank all that out
[28:25] all that old life that past life like
[28:27] brothers been talking about you're going
[28:29] to remember it but you got to come to a
[28:32] certain place in your life to say look
[28:35] I can't do a thing about one another
[28:37] because in the past
[28:40] Satan's going to bring it up every day
[28:43] that's his job
[28:47] right
[28:47] he's good at what he does
[28:51] but God's better
[28:55] I'm exciting very good at his job but
[28:58] he's only he's only God's secretary or
[29:01] he used to be right-hand man
[29:03] so God's still number one but what you
[29:06] got to do is you got to reflect back
[29:07] into the word and say hey this is what I
[29:10] believe we've got to keep pouring it
[29:12] back to the word of God that's why I
[29:13] said even into Daniel 70 weeks that's
[29:16] what I want you to believe in all the
[29:17] things that's being preached here don't
[29:19] just take it for face value right look
[29:23] into the word if brother Brown said
[29:26] anything on Book and Tape and it sounds
[29:29] you hear me sounds contrary to the word
[29:32] it's your Revelation that's wrong
[29:37] my Revelation this wrong he's not
[29:40] William Brown's Revelation that's wrong
[29:42] and the Bible's not wrong we have to
[29:44] come to an absolute we know that brother
[29:47] Brown did make mistakes in his sermons
[29:48] but he corrected those
[29:51] no one corrects a prophet but God
[29:54] all right so I I you know that's why I
[29:56] don't have time for these people that
[29:58] want to correct brother Branham
[30:00] then we need to just throw our books and
[30:02] tapes away we need to fill his church
[30:04] school because he's the next prophet
[30:07] or them or whoever it is Rod Bergen or
[30:10] Jeremy Bergen or or whoever I don't care
[30:13] the name of their names because they're
[30:14] filth to me
[30:16] filthy people they've taken souls to
[30:18] hell and
[30:19] I reckon they just don't care
[30:21] so
[30:23] but if we don't watch it we can say well
[30:26] brother Brown said we always was eternal
[30:29] well there was a there's a point there
[30:32] the Bible said you're lost so brother
[30:34] Brown can't be saying something
[30:35] different what the Bible said but the
[30:37] mind of God tells us that we're sitting
[30:39] in Heavenly places if we're mourning in
[30:41] right
[30:43] now it's like brother Kendra said last
[30:44] night
[30:45] Heavenly places
[30:47] if we're in heaven there's no bad
[30:50] thoughts
[30:51] there's no animosity
[30:53] there's no memory I'll pass
[30:57] only Perfection you're not hurting
[30:59] everything's fine you're not worried
[31:01] about time he just lists a bunch of
[31:03] things and we're not there
[31:05] but wait a minute the Bible says
[31:09] that if you're born again you are risen
[31:12] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[31:15] Jesus
[31:16] not in the world it says in Christ Jesus
[31:18] that's right okay so you get you get
[31:21] what I'm talking about you can make
[31:22] quotes but you got to put them all
[31:23] together
[31:24] so that's right right that's in your
[31:27] soul you're sitting in Heavenly places
[31:28] in your soul why because that's what
[31:30] came to you Heaven has come to Earth
[31:34] inside here but
[31:36] we as humans as the old carnal nature of
[31:41] man
[31:43] it's kind of like I've always said about
[31:44] a a pill if anybody's got a pill you
[31:47] know your little capsule it it it's got
[31:49] all the good stuff inside right but
[31:52] what's on the outside of it is holding
[31:54] it in and unless it gets in the right
[31:57] environment and dissolves that all
[31:59] outside thing
[32:02] it's glycerin actually is what it is
[32:03] plastic once it goes in your stomach
[32:07] what happens to that it dissolves
[32:10] and lets the good stuff out
[32:13] carnal comparison but that's what you
[32:16] and I are
[32:17] we're a capsule with the Holy Ghost
[32:20] Inside everything that we need but if we
[32:22] don't put that thing in a good
[32:24] environment to dissolve that outside man
[32:27] and his ideas and his Doctrine
[32:31] then once inside it's not going to be
[32:32] here
[32:34] but once it's put in the right
[32:36] environment a warm environment and a
[32:38] good Christian atmosphere then that
[32:40] capsule just you can't find it anymore
[32:44] you just see that the medicine done good
[32:47] that's why I see
[32:49] for the Teaching Ministry
[32:55] of the birth
[33:00] and said those two verses that those two
[33:03] states that you're called me back and
[33:05] until the holy ghost shows
[33:07] you're a teacher
[33:10] that's why brother around said teaching
[33:12] places you in the body why it does not
[33:15] confuse you
[33:18] a lot of others can confuse you
[33:21] an evangelist can be confusing if he
[33:23] comes in and throws out some things and
[33:25] leaves but he has his part
[33:28] because what he'll do is he'll spark
[33:29] some he may spark something to preacher
[33:32] the pastor that's here all the time
[33:34] that's one of the evangelists should do
[33:36] and even that's what I try to do when I
[33:37] go out I try to preach to the preacher
[33:41] because I'm there for one day okay
[33:45] you understand what I'm saying I'm
[33:46] preaching to the preacher because if he
[33:48] catches what I'm saying
[33:50] and this is going to tell you but I
[33:51] really don't care if they do
[33:55] I know I'm strange I'm like my dad
[33:59] but if they don't catch a thing but if
[34:01] that preacher can catch what I'm saying
[34:04] he's got 52 weeks a year
[34:08] to sit there and pound it in the people
[34:10] and if they get it praise God I don't
[34:13] care who it comes from but I preach the
[34:16] preachers
[34:17] now y'all I don't
[34:19] y'all I don't because y'all you know I
[34:22] brag about you all the time y'all The
[34:23] Best of the Best
[34:25] but I guess a lot of people hadn't heard
[34:27] any of this that we're talking about
[34:28] nothing
[34:29] but if I sparked that preacher's
[34:31] interest and he can start digging and
[34:33] digging and digging and digging and he
[34:35] preaches it to the people and they get
[34:36] it
[34:37] that's why Paul would stay with one
[34:39] convert one he would get that one
[34:41] convert in the mindset of God and then
[34:43] he would release him and say
[34:45] Ethiopian eunuch
[34:49] right
[34:51] Stephen I mean uh
[34:52] Philip got into a place he could
[34:55] understand the scripture so brother
[34:56] Graham said he went and
[34:58] Ethiopia he had a Revival well hey
[35:01] Philip couldn't have been there the
[35:02] whole time but that Ethiopian unit could
[35:05] okay
[35:06] thank you all right let's go we're
[35:08] behind again yeah
