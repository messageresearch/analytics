========================================

we we've been kind of studying I I just can't get away from remember them which have the rule over you and uh I was thinking what does this have to do with Christmas you know the this time of year and that I think the last couple of years I kind of tailored my little Sunday school lesson more toward the this the season and whatnot but um I I I didn't really feel led to do that today but um it still does have something to do with the holiday season because you read over in the uh Luke Chapter 2 and and the first people that heard about the birth of Jesus were shepherds and um if you go read that story The they heard a Heavenly message that was uh announcing that the word is here and the Shepherds went and found out that the word was there and they went into the city to Proclaim it and everybody that heard their message was astonished and amazed and a't it funny how or interesting how that God sets up that pattern sometimes that you can read in the Bible the first that's what brother Bram said why do they have to be Shepherds why do they have to be Shepherds Shepherds Shepherds know where you can find the word and so I've got just kind of little picture that uh of this the fivefold Ministries five five people in this picture but it's really not just five people it's five different kinds of people that God will use their um their their attributes and things that they're born with to present the word to be able to use them in in different ways so uh let's before we read this again let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord we so thankful to be able to gather around your word once more Lord and so thankful Lord to be GA together with with like f other believers of this like Precious Faith Lord and we're so grateful for all the blessings that you've given unto us in this last year we pray Lord that you'll just bless us today Lord and bless brother Wade as he's prepared and studying Lord open up our hearts to receive what you have for us we ask in your name so Hebrews 13:7 says remember them which have the rule over you have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation and we've kind of been studying in that that this doesn't mean you know necessarily that you're that these men are like ruling over you like with a rod of iron or something like that but it's actually the word that they're preaching that actually um uh uh takes takes control of your life and just to just to background just to just briefly in Ephesian Church age brother R said now I want to say that I believe in leadership but it's not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I believe also that God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge but that rule is by the word so that it is not men ruling but the spirit of God for the word and spirit are one now if you really think that about that that's kind of that's kind of difficult to articulate isn't it God sets a men men over the church but it's actually God doing it through the men but you look at the man and you you think you maybe you you think it's just a man up there but yet God is using that man to speak words to speak some encouragement to help you through life and brother R said in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said and God has said in the church what first apostles then prophets then teachers then evangelists then pastors is that right for the perfecting of the church God has did it it's not the preacher that preaches not mean if he's really getting himself out of the way now is that isn't that why before the service a lot of times preachers will pray Lord help me to get out of the way because we want to get away from all of our conspiracy theories and our political ideas and all our little personal things our vendettas or whatever we might hold against somebody else lay that all the way to the side and just let God speak it's the word all the way the word is what's going to control it's not the preacher that preaches it's God preaching through him it's not the prophet that sees the vision it's God speaking through him I do nothing except the father shows me first what to do that's the reason he had to go through Samaria that's why all these other things taken place follow life his life and see if that isn't right and in blind Bemus he said and God said in the church first what missionaries or Apostles Apostles and missionary as I told you taught you is the same thing one sent Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors God set in the church for the perfecting of the church that's Divine gifts that God foreordained and set into the church seat those are for the perfecting of the church Jesus speaks through his Pastor speaks through his teacher speaks to his Seer his Prophet speaks through his missionary to the countries and so forth that's his gifts that he's put in the church now now this time of the year is when we're giving gifts and whatnot aren't you glad that God give he he sent nine spiritual gifts into the church he sent five five of these predestinated gifts into the church to speak a word of encouragement and help and so that's what it says in Ephesians 411 he gave some he gave these gifts to you and I he gave some Apostles and some prophets some look at the the way it's worded there because at at different times at different seasons of your life you might need a different gift more when you're first becoming a Christian it might benefit you more to hear from an evangelist but then you start coming to a church and you need something grounded somebody that can help you and counsel you and that's where you need a pastor and you might need a you might have some questions about the word and that's when you need a teacher so different seasons of your life you'll need you'll benefit from these different kind of gifts and he gave some prophets and some EV why why would you need a prophet maybe over in Africa where everybody's it's a little bit more a different situation or whatever you need God will put a prophet right there to be able to tell you well you're fixing to kill somebody and this is what this is what going to and and and lay things out like that because God knows exactly what we have need of and he'll give us that amen there some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry Min for the edifying of the body of Christ so let's look at as as time's already flying let's look at the Apostle the term Apostle is derived from the Greek word AP apostolos which means one who is sent away or messenger and the term missionary is derived from the Latin word missionaries meaning pertaining to sending or echoing the concept of being sent on a mission now I got a picture here of of brother Paco who we met down in Nicaragua and and he actually I was watching one of the videos of brother a and he was calling him out to preach and down there when we were down there I got to uh just kind of talking to some of the brothers and they were kind of talking about how that there's different individuals that you can if if God just really God will kind of move them into a place where they just are more maybe more impactful than some of the others and brother Paco is one of these individuals and he he uh I've got a picture here he he will go into the the J he's constantly going into the jungle going I've got him on he's my Facebook friend and you can see him constantly posting videos of going way into the jungle going down a river deep deep into the like this where there's just mud he's got to wear uh boots to to even walk in Minister CU there's so much mud another picture I was looking at had his his wife was with him and she she had fallen down and slipped in the mud and you can see it's not a very nice situation it's it's rough but God calls these people and to to be to take the gospel to a to a place where nobody's ever heard it before maybe nobody's ever know anything about it you got to break it down and make it simple and then and then set things in order in a way where maybe you know maybe a pastor or a teacher might have never seen a situation like that before now there's an apostle let's see what brother B said about an apostle he said an apostle is a missionary both the same word someone that sent why you never desire to be called a missionary I don't know a missionary AR is an apostle and how they was sent all these God has put in the church then how does he touch this I I found this quote online that says never pity missionaries Envy them they are where the real action is where life and death sin and Grace Heaven and Hell converge and there's a brother down in Nicaragua preaching as as these these little young believers are coming to the to the Altar for salvation and you think about they they are where the where the real action is I was talking to a brother about what a statement that Lonnie Jenkins made years ago that when where you go into a place where the gospel's never been pre presented before you always watch out for God to come on the scene and do something truly miraculous if the gospel NE has never come into an air before and it starts being preached you watch and you see limbs being restored and eyes coming open and the service is just absolutely phenomenal cuz look that's where the real action is where the gospel is being preached in a place that's never gone before that's what a missionary is being is called called to do the the door inside the door brother R said now we have those things in the church what are they for is the Apostle the Apostle is the highest calling a missionary is the highest calling prophet and so forth down but they're not any different they're all God's servants sit together to temper and bring the body of Christ together and he said I want to say that the greatest call there is in Earth to my opinion is the mission field anyone who is a missionary is an apostle for the word Apostle means one cent so they're both the same word or used the same why why would that be the greatest call there is on Earth because that's fulfilling the Great Commission to go into the all the world and preach the gospel to go there everywhere and preaching and he said now I believe a missionary is a guy that goes and comes that's a missionary Paul was a missionary he didn't stay now look at let me back up for a second I I don't mean to skim over this too fast he said if you go over there to stay they call that a missionary but that's a homesteader you just changed your residence see that's not a missionary Paul was a missionary he didn't stay he just kept going and going and going a missionary not just change his residence just keep going a missionary why cuz there's just something burning in you to take that gospel to somebody that had heard it before the Apostle is a special man he's a set her in order he's a man that's sent from God to set the things in order what's that mean you come into a place where where you got some kind of strange marriage and divorce situations You' never heard of before and he's just LED of God to to know how to position everything let's get this straightened out this way and and he's he's he's called of God to get to get things right to to approach situations that maybe are some odd and maybe maybe difficult but God has called a man for that purpose and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and brother BR would say there's five ministerial offices how many believes that there's first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists how can you say there's a pastor or evangelist without saying there's a prophet now that's that's just something maybe to keep your in pocket in your back pocket for that time when you need to pull it out how can you say that there's there's all these other preachers and there's not a prophet and I believe there still prophets today that's that's one of those the people that leave the message they throw they pull that argument out and say well show me that there was ever New Testament prophets there was plenty of new agabus and all the others and there're still New Testament prophets today even even now and this is one of them and I'm not promoting other ministers or whatever but I think many of us have heard about brother Abraham that he he's uh I was talking to brother from from Africa I I was talking to some other pastors that that were talking about how that you there's so many when he comes over to the states that want to get want him to come to their Church to discern things and to talk about things that are going on in people's lives that you know it's kind of hard to get to get uh him to come around but let's let's let's read what brother Brown said about uh in questions and answers he said I don't claim to be his Prophet many times I've said it when I think I when I didn't think I said it catch myself on the tape but I say that sometimes because if you want to give it in terms a prophet is in the English term is merely a preacher anybody knows that get the dictionary see a prophet is a preacher under the English dictionary but under the Hebrew or the Greek a prophet is a Seer one who forsees things and foretells things so let's think about that statement a pro a new testament Prophet means all of these fivefold gifts because they're preaching the word and they've got a revelation that they're sharing with you but there's one of those that's a Seer so that doesn't mean let's let's maybe just set something straight for a moment that doesn't mean if you have a particular amount of Revelation that you're automat Al a prophet no a prophet is a seer in other words that doesn't mean because you're a really good teacher or something that you're a prophet that you to fit into this category you got to be a Seer a Seer is one who foresees things and foretells things and brother BR would say a prophet is a Seer and is referred to in the Bible as the eagle who goes way high in the air and the higher you go the farther you can see he said a sear is a is a he is a Seer that in the spirit climbs beyond the emotion of the church he goes beyond the rhythm of the music he goes beyond the Clapping of the hands he goes beyond the joy among the saints he goes beyond all that God brings him up into a realm alone then he opens his eyes and he lets him look around and see things that is to come you to think about that that God can catch a man and move him up into the Eternal Realms of God and be able to look around and then like like brother R said peering over a fence and then he come back and tell us what he saw over the fence then he brings him back down among the members of the body to for for tell them of what is in the making a prophet is also a gift of knowledge a gift of knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which Co goes up and finds out these things that are to come and brings them back down but they must compare with the Bible with the book he said now but this Seer his subconscious is not back there neither is it here it's right here both of them are right together and now just kind of skipping down to save a few moments of time and this man that sees Visions can't help it he's just made up like that God made this man not to dream dreams this one to dream dreams and made this one to see Visions now think about every one of these men are made up in the way that they are to bring the message in the way that God wants them to bring it each one of them has a special makeup he said in the signs of his coming he said now watch he was the word see now Jesus he just said this because he was the word but to us we have have to approach God through the word see the word comes to the prophets they're not the word in the Old Testament now Elijah and Moses and all those great prophets they wasn't the word they were a perverted body that the word of God came to the Bible said the word of God come to the prophets they wasn't the word but Jesus was the word that's why it says he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists now here's the the one that that that we like especially when we're when we're a new Christian he says the Evangelist is a special man he's a man that's burning like a fireball he runs into a city and preaches his message then gets out of there somewhere else see he's a special man he's he can just he he can just come in and what's he doing now he's let's let's look at let's kind of break this down the primary role of an evangelist is to proclaim the gospel the good news about Jesus Christ he's communicating that core message of what how to be saved and making a call to your heart for to to come to the Lord so evangelists are going to play a role in in Outreach and and and growth they're they're they're really critical for bringing in new Believers and it's to lead people to a conversion experience and to encourage existing Believers and they're associated with church growth and Revival so what brother bandam said he said when you come out of this at I I I I I just found this quote where uh you know he be he began his ministry now you think about that he's a prophet that can slip into the role of a teacher or or or a pastor or an evangelist and in the beginning stages of his ministry God told him that to do the work of an evangelist and this is that Vision where he he saw the Oneness on one side and the trinitarian on one side and he he grabbed from each side and pulled it together and then he saw his Tabernacle that he was going to be preaching out of the building building and God told him this this is not your Tabernacle and he said where and he said I've seen the Tabernacle as it is today I said where's my Tabernacle and he set me down under the bright blue sky and he said do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine in other words preach as hard as you can and P pull and call people to what you're preaching because there's going to be a time that people won't want to hear the truth now isn't it interesting that that a pastor can slip into the move slip into that Evangelistic role or a pastor can teach that you can move back and forth but you really got a a a a a a a a spot a slot that you're default to the best way to say it I guess and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors brother R said but you see in the church there is the pastor and that Pastor is a special person he's built now now look all the others are built where they can just come and go the Apostle's going he's he's just always on the move the Evangelist can go into a church and I tell you when you go and preach at a different church it's nice to be able to swoop in preach a nice message uh you know if anything's a little bit odd maybe that the pastor didn't like you're you're on the road and the pastor can sweep it up and clean it up you're gone go out to eat you come back to church but a pastor can't do that a pastor is built to where he can put up with the fusses of the people he's a burden Bearer he's the ox of the team he's a man that can sit down when somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them two families and take neither side now you think about what a supernatural thing this would be to people fussing and can't get along and the pastor's built that way that he can sit between them and smooth out the fusses that's right and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness without taking either side see he's a pastor he knows how to take care of things now if you break this down again Pastor comes from the Latin for Shepherd pastor's guide care for and protect the congregation similar to how a Shepherd tends to sheep now all of these you could say are Shepherds and that goes back to that story in Luke Chapter 2 why it had to be Shepherds first it had to be Shepherds to know where Christ was so they could go into the City and tell everybody this is where Jesus is this is how to get to him but this one is the special one that's really he's really The Shepherd of that local congregation to keep all the sheep from running off keep everybody United keep everybody moving in the same direction and see what pastors teach they can slip over into that teaching role and explain the scripture and pastors provide personal and C spiritual counseling if you got a problem in your life you can go to the pastor and get get some help and pastors they also visit the sick they elderly and and and help people out that just need some personal personal help and of course they're the administrative head of that local church and brother Bram said always honor your pastor why why give special honor to your pastor because of all that that I just read Because of they're dealing with the fusses dealing with all the complaining dealing with people that feel like the things should go in a different direction they're dealing with all that he he said he's worthy of every bit of Honor you could give him the Bible said that yes sir and don't muzzle the ox that Treads out the corn I saw this big dispute on Facebook where everybody was saying that ministers shouldn't be paid and that's what brother B was saying here he said if you're dealing with all that there's nothing wrong with getting a paycheck from the tith or something there's nothing wrong with receiving a blessing because they're pouring out a blessing they're pouring out their life to you why should a pastor have to worry about paying their hospital bill or paying their or being able to pay next month's Morgans and everything it's they're they're Worthy of every bit of Honor that you can give them am and I I am the resurrection and the life he said now th then you have to got you got to have confidence this is the house of judgment the house of God where God comes down and passes his judgment your pastor is supposed to be a righteous man the congregation supposed to be with him 100% you're supposed to be just 100% together and in there now you see what brother ad is explaining that that is a role of a pastor to keep everybody moving in the same direction and to keep them United and to keep the keep the spirit moving you're supposed to be just 100% together and in there if you're not then Satan's got a way to get in you got a loophole somewhere so have everything cleared out how's Satan going to get in if you're not United if you're not in unity in Revelation book of symbols he said if a boy was at the door and knocked at the door latch tell the user ushers I have a telegram here for Mrs Mrs so and so and Mr so and so he would be a messenger an Earthly Angel your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church Messenger to the church therefore Pastor should never leave that word but stay straight with the word because he's feeding the shepherd's place because the word pastor means Shepherd look it up and find out if that ain't right a pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer over a certain flock to feed him with what but with the word of God now that's what Paul is talking about remember them that have the rule over you not with a rod of iron but with the word of God where the word can claim your life that's why Jeremiah 3:15 says I will give you pastures and that word the translation of that word actually means Shepherds I will give you pastors according to my heart which shall feed you with what knowledge and understanding in 1 Peter 5:3 says feed the flock of God which is among you taking over sight thereof not by constraint but willingly not a filthy ler not for filthy ler but of a ready mind and Jesus said when when he was going to go on the cross he told him when he saw he he was as he was preaching going into the cities he said he saw the multitudes and he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd now in the natural that's what happens when uh when you when a when the Sheep when the shepherd goes he goes to sleep or something or goes he goes takes a little vacation then the Sheep start to be scattered that's natural in the natural and that's the same thing that will happen in the spiritual that's what Jesus was talking about here in Matthew chapter 9 he said then saith he unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into his Harvest and we'll stop right there God bless you thank [Applause] you
