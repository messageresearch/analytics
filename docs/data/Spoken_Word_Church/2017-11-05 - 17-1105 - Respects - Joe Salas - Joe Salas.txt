their tent and their wives and their sons and their little children this man died current death along man or if they be visitors after the dissertation of all men then the Lord had not sent me and it a professor he had made Nana speaking all these words at the ground under them they know that a taint to them went out alive into the pit and therefore closed upon them and they perish them from among the congregation there came out of a far from the Lord of punching the 250 men the upper instance last time I was talking about a kingdom and you're not a kingdom and unless God is tell you what you do so you all quit for me that I do today I want to talk on now on respect brother Wade wants us to do two Sundays in a row so if I hurt you a little bit next week I'll have a band-aid I'll be nice this week I mean I see what happens today let's go to Genesis chapter 4 chapter 4 we start with 1 verse 9 and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain instead of having gotten a man from the Lord and she again bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and a process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the Lord in Abel he also brought to the first crystalline persons are you say that he spoke and now that fed there of an order and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his contrast fell and the Lord said unto Cain why are the rough for the contras Palmer he does do it well shalt not thou be accepted in the booths not will same light at the door and unto thee shall be he desired so the rule over him and Cain talked with Abel his brother and he came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where the Abel that brother he said I know not am I my brother's keeper Cain had respect for God no ellipsis that respect means to consider consider worthy a high regard or to refrain from interfering [Applause] [Applause] what won't lost Walter yep from the beginning of time that the devil has been trying to divide us to divide us or kill us you know brother Brown said I said the devil and I had to fire harder shut because we got shootin each other so love what's that been used throughout human history for both protection and separation perhaps the most impressive one ever constructed as a Great Wall of China which is an amazing 13,000 mile 170 mile 13 knots 70 miles long every day the most famous one in modern time was the Berlin Wall and barely cut a city in half and preventing German citizens from travelling freely but physical walls aren't the only ones humans built because of our need to feel secure we sometimes direct invisible boundaries to keep other people from getting too close unforgiveness the bodies wall it means to keep both the one who wronged us they also keep us both in prison and self-destructive from consequences and bitterness well we got now the border in Boardwalk identification brother Brown said there is some people you just love being around but there are some other people that create an atmosphere that you just just stay away from Ephesians 4:11 215 and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for there for perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry per if they find out the body of Christ he will all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ then we have for be no more children tossed to and fro care about with every wind of doctrine by the sleep a Manning cunning correctness where they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him and all the things which is the head even Christ [Applause] and the message respect for the granite said the only way they do can respect God is to respect one another that way if you want somebody to say something good about you if you say something good about somebody else then they'll say something good about you we were to see my friend in Gastonia and we went to their church and their pastor has a nice spirit you know yeah you get you overhearing and you say well that come from and you say make your order I needed that but you know some some preachers a hitch of the evening just the way they say that you know you know you know it's different but some people hit you over the head or like sister Barbara or something she could preach it play hit your head I'm sorry Roger ordered me to hit you that hard you know I mean so we're all made different I talked to somebody I'm not gonna say their name and I talked about its best of us a nice spirit II said I'm gonna be like that not I don't think the world and it's answered not in a million years it's not gonna be like no names [Applause] well-well-well have a part to play even though the mom said that you have to teach your kids you know about Jesus you know so in them programmer life story says and look young children young folks I don't care what it is you always have respect to your mother and mother your father and mother I think one of the office things that I can hear the little children say it or young folk is the old man and the old woman listen that's not the older man no woman that's your daddy and your mother someday when you see them going out of the room headfirst and there will beneath the casket squeaking you know it isn't the old man a little old woman that's right you hear that preacher state ashes to ashes dust to dust you realize that the best friend your head on earth is going down the trouble that it is you learn too late don't weep and cry them and send them thus the flower give them to them now be a good boy or good girl that was 50 years ago they banished you mothers and fathers you go to Walmart look at some of these mothers so what do they do know they pressure Joe something Texas to 2125 and Mosley was content to drill with a man and he gave Moses support his daughter and she bare him a son and he called his name Russia or he said I have been a stranger in it in a strange land and he came to present a process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children is really excited by the reason of the bondage they cried and they cried came up went to God by the reason of bondage and God heard their groaning and the I remember is covenant with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and he looked up on the children of Israel and God had respect unto them Leviticus 19 11 18 you shall not steal neither deal also you need a lot to another and you should not certify my name falsely neither shalt thou profane the name of the god i am the lord i shall not defraud anybody the robbing the which is a ten days are not sure I buy with day or night until the morning thou shalt not birthday a death not put a stumbling block before the blind but shalt fear thy God I am the world you shall not do in judgment thou shall not rest respect the person of the poor nor honor the person a mighty but in Russia they shall not judge thy neighbor and I shall not go up and down as a tail paramam like people neither shall stand against the blood I shall not hate that brother in thy heart I shall in any wise rebuke thy neighbor not supper sing unto Him thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children I like people but I shall love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord I'm getting a little bendy Leviticus 26 719 and you shall change the admin they shall fall before you by the sword and five of you shall chase in hundred and a hundred you shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemies shall be always for you by the story for I would have respect unto you it make you fruitful and multiply and establish my covenant with you one in 1617 now charging churches at that time saying here the Cossack between your brother and just ruts in the tree every man his brother and the stranger that is with him you shall not respect personal thing judgment but you shall hear this small as well as the great he shall not be afraid at the face of the men for the judgment at his thoughts and the call is too hard for you bring it up to me and I will hear the other arm is 16 18 20 judges and officers shall make thee you know the gates which the Lord God give it throughout the tribes and they shall judge the people with just judgment thou shall not rest judgment us a naturist that person irritative forgive to blind the eyes of the voice and perverted with the righteous men there is which altogether share the power I'm asleep and heard the man which the Lord made it big [Applause] and Elijah died and they bear him the bantha the more was invaded the land in it and had to come in it 17:13 20.3 and Elijah died they buried him and they banned the mall but invaded the man and they come in on the heat of the year and he can't do pastor or barring a man they behold they spider-man a man they test the man into the sepulchre paralyzed and when a man would had done and took the bones of life that he revived and stood up upon his feet but her soul king of syria oppressed Israel all the days that joke also have and the Lord was gracious unto them and compassion on them and him which had respect unto them because that is covenant with Abraham Isaac and Jacob they would not destroy them either test be them from his presence [Applause] a greater than Sun is here there's no great one that money how can you have faith when you just out of respect from one another we're all running Christ Jesus there's no big man in little man we're all the same we're children of our Father and were his children so we all got a part to play I used to work for Toyota making cars I'm used to play ping-pong and one time this guy did show up ago he's there when you say you know I must be about my father's business we were speechless what can say he was he was telling people about the Lord you know what can you say he said influence people come to church and cut up and laugh talk make fun city or that gospel is being preached no reverence at all and they'll meet you on the street and with you don't expect any respect from people we mustn't do that but yet it shows Christianity dignity to at least honor that people say good morning brother or whatever you wish some of them holler little preacher hello that's so common and in repair if you know what it is they are not conscious of the presence of the God it won't become so common and religion it becomes such a love you until there's no respect just that it's always been and may I say the world we have seen the last year or two New Kingdom god Artie well if seen unless you're doing the Kim I got to put every born-again Christian into action but the thing of this we don't respect it to realize that it's tough we're just kind of leaders little curious we'd like to see little things that give a sensation we like to feel good we like to do this thing that when it really comes to really respect an end believe it with all our heart it puts us into action man respect you what that took on man respect you love you respect your own tenure come together because you remember there's lamis for the home not just 101 - that to be brought in everything that could be brought in we should love each other and believers to respect rate himself from the world another little bending the sign now a time now when God signs a gift to the earn that people respect it's always a golden nation of the people when they reject it it's always chaos for their people he does that every eight I'm telling you America that we would only expect the gift that God sent us and only golden tea we have to worry but the Russian astronaut and the atomic bombs and things yes sir our security is in Christ he lives our security the Empress God has ordained a certain thing to be done and it must be done that way we're not to inject our own ideas kingdom and we're here here to respect his idea and his Commandments I'm not gonna farm back to our sister but no matter what the other woman does God's touch of better lay here no matter what some other layman down in the bottle Gus got your paper here what to do we'll get it to you after a while perhaps what layman is to do and administer all of us has our play said we must abide and our common the pick shield I think that's one of the things that's holding this nation together because they always had respected the Jew that's right kill him and place the honor Jew God will honor you there's a bunch of Jews that renegades just look there are gentle the same way but the real Jew God put his name on that book before the foundation of the world and here he was murdered on in this time and God has no respected person what it did for heavy right he'll do it for you new ministry blind burn embarrassed when you give anything give it from your heart if you can't do that don't do it because you kids won't be respected by God to do it a lot of the goodness of your heart the Queen of the South a woman I have the respect enough to raise a child in the days when they do everything else and try to get rid of them God will respect them you'll hear about that woman that puts her in heaven this world's gone crazy so ten evade up one of the children was up pretty big man today I'm making now open you don't I don't know how she got in there this guy was in quantum hot there's put three yellow and there was one little one in her so we call the Caliph's tom to apologize because that's racist so this world does not call common sense brother Aaron says I'm afraid to make fun of myself because I might offend somebody it's world's fall apart Permenter cage and this man this man walked right up to the same partner and right by every guard everything else right into the front of the Emperor and the Emperor didn't want to respect God's servant you know that's not memories so he just turned his head and wouldn't even respect them you know what God did he tried to talk to him and he just kept his head turn and God was going to make this this heel and pay respect to his servant so he just said the thing on fire and skirts skirts him on a receipt raised him up and made him stand up now that bubble history ICN counselor here to respect his servant he made him stand up and even scores to see where he was sitting far went to a part of course the bottom receiving he had from Tampa from there God has a way of doing things you know my joy first I have to go pretty far everything the uncertain sound now the person has got it but a given that he's called down by the scripture and they fly who said it it shows it wasn't a gift from God because any Africa will respect the world because I explained we can't have faith when one time to pay respect and honor to one another see we can't do that we can't have faithfully have got to honor I'm believing my brothers sure is love but they respect and then if he goes to God respect you cannot have respect until you have fear you got to have fear of God Solomon said also in the pro mores proper that the fear of the God is beginning of wisdom they don't mean that you are afraid of him but they mean that you're giving in respect and rarely and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way your fear list you will do something wrong before you can have respect you got to have fear and God demands it he demands respect cutters he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respect God the man respects from a service a service now we know that they were a servant because it many Pastis service bodies work they take the service and makes them servants of God and prove that they are sober by making his work work through them servant and if you respect that sermon you respect God so when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we respect in God but I want to bring another thing through your members if you if God sent a messenger and better educated by the sign that he was messenger sent from God and stuff to them to obey this messenger exactly they must obey the messenger and I have respect to that messenger you can't disrespect God you've got to respect God if you don't believe it just keep still keep away from either either do that or come rather and inspect it don't make fun of other people I guess when they're worshipping God [Applause] he said you can't respect the man of respect to alpha Z holes in God that's the circular right see respecting then Minister comes up your pastor always respect him I heard a congregation talk about the pastor how they just talk about him run him down we do it how does that pastor ever going to do anything for you you can't do it I don't say this church but I mean churches I've seen that give you you've got to love your pastor you got to know that he's a human being but yet God has made him his pastor the Holy Ghost that made him overseer and you got to respect him in a manner and no matter what the pastor's done if you respect him your heart as God's servant God will respect you for doing it that's pretty good we got to keep that in mind it's easy to do here it's below equations for 4:30 [Applause] [Applause] Jesus 438 says they grieve not the Holy Spirit of God were we or steel unto the day of redemption that all the bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind to one another Jeremy tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you and all the little bending now do we sometimes read the holy spirit by talking bad about each other and that is coming for for a perfect bride not for one that's got them agreements in with each other yes now do we do we get angry do we get angry yes we do get angry yes we're convinced our anger is justified is watching we're entitled to it is good to be angry even here's a partner that you did long anger is universal I bet you're thinking but God and God was angry too late that's gotta get angry yes yes he does but you know what he can be trusted with it because he sent us we're not is the Creator we're not this he's the ultimate judge and we are there are certain things that are his problems along because of his perfection Christians 426 a particular scripture that many had committed to memory when you're angry do not sin and make sure to stop being angry before they in day to get James my silly did James j1 19 to 21 wherefore my beloved brother that every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to read for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity not thickness and we see with meekness the engraved work which is able to save your soul brother Joe green does this all the time I said something just about the painting though this ghost ain't got the scarlet right a long time I almost felt like [Music]
