everybody in the house of the Lord I writing on a note where wouldn't forget it you're not that old yet but that's good to see everybody to the internet people we're starting a little early today because we bad weather coming in tonight and all and we want to get everybody out and get it to go I know they've uh they've got a certain order of things that you say but I was sitting there yesterday thinking and this is what I would wrote down you know those that come for the morning service come together in Fellowship now this is Brother Dale okay this ain't reading somebody else's those who come for the evening service they love their Pastor those who come for the Wednesday service love God those who come for all three of them morning evening and Wednesday they love God and His word those who come occasionally want to be seen that's my way of saying it that you know all right you love him Romans 8 and then John 6 remember now the uh fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday brother Tom kaines remember that remember to pray and I know you've already prayed and waiting them on the way home pray that the Lord would bless and guide each one take care of them on the highway and brother Joe and him and you know give them a safe journey and just pray for all of the things remember the announcements that have been made and just have let the Lord have his way father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the hour that we have thank you for the word that you've given unto us and we just ask you Lord that you'd have your way with each and every one of us forgive our sins bless each one Lord and just let your light shine in our lives because we desire that more than anything bless Wade and June and Joe and Rachel and the kids and all Lord and just take care of them on traveling and anybody else out doing their traveling today because we know it's rough and just have your way we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Romans 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified P tense P tense Already Done Right what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us or as we've read in John 6 verse 60 many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that the disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you in other words you got problems with what I'm saying what if you what if ye shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before you know that happened on the Ascension some saw him go up right it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now to not spend much time as a background but to make sure that we uh get an understanding and ready to move on uh what is the seed of God it's God's word we know that all right it's the word of God but now is the letter on a page we call that the word of God we say well we've got this Bible this is the word of God all right now that's a truth but is it all the truth about it the what about that word that we hear why does it not produce if it's word and spirit being alive you know why does it not produce now it does you know come on but what has to happen to make it produce God has to come down and Quicken those disciples walked with the word for three and 1/2 years they were already Bible uh studiers you know of the Old Testament Scrolls and things they were already maybe spent their life listening maybe couldn't read it but they had heard it well see then when Jesus began to talk to them they could follow him up to a certain line but then it would just seem like it would go in like it did with with Nicodemus you know he could go up with him for a certain way but then when he said you must be born again then see they it was just something different and as was reading this morning why can't you understand my Speech cuz you don't understand my words all why would it put speech and word in the uh same uh scripture you know if there's not a different thought there in the concept of it that you you can't understand my speech because the word that you have heard has not been quickened to you is that the way of stating it what you've heard has not been quickened it it's still letters on and even though they could walk with Jesus and here personally God speaking to them right still that was not quickened totally to bring a new birth now I told you I'll Min mention this as we go through the series a lot that I'm trying to get us to see what the the the seed of God is because if the prophet would say you're born with a seed in you we want to know what that was that's right well why was it not made alive to their disciples now certain things were right and brother brandom in his reference we will get to it of say like the little woman at the well he will be referencing to her as the seed being there and he'll say that seed Was Made Alive right when she said you know you're the Messiah see it was made alive but that didn't give the new birth amen right and if anything it was going to go with anything you'd say well surely Mary would have been the one when she was the one who carried the very seed to birth to produce Christ but see brother R said Mary had to go to the upper room all right if that seed Was Made Alive to the little woman at the well then why did she need an upper room experience are you with me see then we need to understand so that's what I'm trying to do is lay it down and get it to the point to where that we can see really what is the seed of God so we talked about it this morning as being what it's not letters on a page it's not because you can hold it and I do and cherish it and there are people and I'm not I'm I'm bragging on them all right going off on myself there's people that would not make one mark in a Bible you know right no letters in it no you know no marking no underlining why because they count it the word of God well I'm bragging on them all right I'm not derogatory to them but you see I want to know what it's talking about and I want to remember you know the the things that are said so I write down where the Prophet explained it all right and jot down a little thought you know and and I've got it here where brother random is in the 288 of the seal book I didn't bring this quote but I might have brought it I can't remember but when he said talking about this my my words are spirit and their life he said the word is spirit in word form and that's the one I think we read this morning see I wrote that down where did I remember it it's in word form the form means uh like Jesus said uh not being T it equal but in the form of God the amorphia of God the changing from naturally what we see all right so the the word once it's revealed is changed in you amen right as always say about Martin Luther see don't tell them how many times he read that of the just shall live by faith but one day amen it was quickened unto him right he was ready to challenge the world you know about what he saw why because it was something alive he didn't care if they excommunicated him you know you know a good old Catholic boy they couldn't stand that cuz man they they believe you know you can excommunicated you you don't even make a trip to Paradise you you exit off some other way and you don't get no praying out the purgatories and things you know well it's a fear but Martin Luther didn't fear that cuz he had something alive in him all right now then that word Made Alive so then it would have to begin with having the germ you remember this morning in a grain of corn it's not the hust you know the outsides of the things it's not that it's that life within the grain is the seed of that corn all right see then The Word Alive in you and me is that seed of life something that we can stand on we don't have to be afraid of it right are you are you afraid that one day they're going to take you and deprogram you you know then then you don't have what you're talking about that's right right see the alive word can never be deprogrammed it get it just won't work you know but now let's read a few things in relation forgive me it started yesterday and it just aggravating this old gry cough drop don't have it sometimes but you know last night probably two hours of talking and then today but let's just read some things from the prophet let's start off with one we ended up with the last couple this morning and let's just read them and think about it and just comment very little go ahead when number seven on the notes which is God's power of transformation 1965 911 paragraph 33 he's talking about a familiar text and you pastors you know it but yet one thing about the word of God it never grows old that's right that's right now because it's God it never goes old through ever Generation Now from pretty near about 2,800 years or better this word of God has been read by man priest and so forth and never does it grow old I've been reading it myself for some 35 years and each time I read it I find something new that I looked over the first time are you familiar with that is that you know okay watching because it is inspired so you know that means you know what I think he's expressing is I read it and I get something new so you cannot exhaust the word of God why because it's inspired right all right it is God in letter form I like that next words there see it's the attributes of God speaking for forth and is placed on paper now the attributes of God are the thoughts of God right that's right all right so the Bible is the thoughts of God go ahead to number eight which is taken from the four seal we'll go down to paragraph 67 because he's dealing up here with the word and the spirit the word itself is spirit it's spirit and word form now that's that sounds uh in other words a man has to be speaking by Revelation about something if he's going to say that the word itself is spirit it's spirit and word form see there's something he's saying right because that's not human terminologies you you understand it's not just normal it's a person trying to express something he's trying to show us the the word and what it is all right then you see when it's quickened or brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and it acts see because that now look here a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word that's right and then when a thought is presented it's a word now for the next few weeks we will be dealing with this thought the prophets got the thought he don't know they got the word now see you brother BR said it was first Moses thought he said it's not word yet he said then he speaks it it becomes the word right now so keep that in mind because that's what we're dealing with a thought has to be a thought before it can be a word then when a thought is presented it's a word now this you talking about the Bible right is the God's thought that he has placed in the word now watch and then when we re receive it from him it becomes a word so the entire Bible is the thoughts of God we are not having to are depending upon getting some thought out of some magical realm or somewhere because that's what man does that's what calls his organizations then denominations is people getting their thoughts all right the prophet said one Prophet will always compare with the other Prophet right all right see because he he's dependent on lining it up all right so then the thoughts of God has been brought to you and we're not trying to get so spiritual until we can hear the voice of God speak something to us because remember there's many voices and Satan can talk to you and it sounds real beautiful right and he talks to a lot of people but see I'm not trying to find something something else now I'm going to illustrate it so listen You'll see how much I depend on it I'm holding up to people that would never hear see what we're doing I'm holding up the Bible and I believe the prophet was saying this is God's thoughts right now and when we receive it's placed in the word and when we receive it it becomes a word all right now at the same time I'm going to hold up quotes of the Prophet which represents the message I believe this message brought to you and I what the Bible is saying right that's the purpose of a prophet all right now now he could not go he didn't go to gre's Alman and get something and bring it he took the Bible and from that Bible he expresses to you and I he calls it uh reading between the lines all right but remember now he said the between the lines can't be no different than what's on the line that's right right but see we could read that uh Abraham and Sarah he she was he was 100 she was 90 you know all right and we realize hey no matter what age you're living in you know at that time it come on down to about 120 years but even if it's living a thousand years hundred's still gaining pretty good right right but now Abraham then had to believe that somebody was talking to him right and he was getting the thoughts all right now if he was getting the thoughts and he was getting old right but yet he takes off on a journey brother Brown said about I forgot how many miles seemed like he said 300 and he went down through there and they run into that King you know and the King wanted to take Grandma right sayah for his wife all right now we could read that right right but we could not get out of that that they were turned back right that's between between the lines but it's on the lines because it's already what's been said I'll return unto thee and I'll do this that and the other you know all right see the reading between the lines is not an addition so to me now you know people will take one and they line up with the other that's okay you know but to me this Bible this Prophet never added a word to it he told us what was in it right right we took this Bible and proved that hell was eternal according to our understanding he took this Bible and proved that hell was not Eternal and he had it all lined up right all right so you see my dependence we don't know what this Bible says unless we know what what this Prophet has brought us that's right well that's my total dependence now it's always been that way and that's the way I believe it I don't believe he can tell you anything contrary he cannot add to the word and that's where a lot of people think you know that they say well well uh brother Brandon about the the seven Thunders he said that'll be made known to somebody in other words to you he said no you can't add to the word word or take away he said it's what's in the word all right see that way then what are we looking at we're looking at that this prophet in expressing the word to us he's bringing the thoughts of God Amen right to you and I right now if that thought's contrary to the Bible where would we have it but see he's telling us what the Bible is saying and that's making a thought so he said this is God's thought when we receive it it becomes a word so it's not the word so you say the the seed is the word now what are you saying are you saying the letter of the Bible see where we'd be going wrong it's not the letter of the Bible this Bible is not now I'm on pray God help me this is not what can I say would you understand it if I said this is not the word of God without going haywire on me this is the word of God but every word in this Bible the prophet said has been made Alive by somebody right this Bible is a record of a living people now do you understand what I mean it's a record of people Peter James John it it's been made alive but there's some things in here that ain't been made alive right that's right right now there where that's right this comes in to tell us what ain't been made alive yet but yet it's been spoke of Chang in a moment twinkle of an eye that hasn't been made alive that's right but it's been spoke of ire like we read it see Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout oh one of these days we look at you're com to God down hey we found out that ain't exactly what it is well that's between the lines no that's off the lines because it's not anything the line says you just got to find out who the Lord is and how he descends right and he descends through what the prophet's message all right now you got it in the right place see now you can say the Bible is a seed now you can say the Bible the word of God is a seed why because it's something like Mary that we said this morning even though she could say within herself and believe that Isaiah 9:6 do you understand what what I believe the prophet was expressing one of these days if you don't run it in your computer you can find it that he was explaining that Mary heard from her mother what a virgin shall conceive now when that was made alive to her when that angel there's no record that he quote in Isaiah 9:6 you know what I mean he's not emphasizing the scripture as much as he's emphasizing the personal appearance to her all right and she says be it unto me according to Thy word without the Holy Ghost right without the Holy Ghost to to explain it but brother R said she was simply looking back and saying that's Isaiah 96 now remember another time in the Bible when a man was sitting there and he took the scroll and he read it you remember he said this day this scripture is what revealed or made alive right right remember Jesus Isaiah 61 you know this day there script wasn't that what Mary was saying this day Isaiah 9:6 is alive in me right be it unto me according to Thy word Isaiah 9:6 is alive she wasn't just taking something out of the Skies from an angel you know a thought or an idea she had the scriptures she was in the scriptures her mother had told her you remember Moses mom told him right you know he took mom's Revelation and he tried to deliver Israel right and he got a dead Egyptian but when he went to the back side of the desert there was no scripture that he could read about that right go remember he was the one that wrote it later on okay you you get me he now know scripture but that one spoke from the burning bush made it so real until he takes off to Egypt to deliver see when you and I realize as the prophet said who we are and what we're doing here we're going to say this day this scripture is fulfilled right because it'll be real to you and I now there's the seed of God it's something real a seed remember takes the two the union of time it's alive every word of God is a seed right but remember it's an a alive word okay think about it look at the next one the queen of the South 1960 11:27 the evening E34 he's talking about Holy Ghost is an assurance to you that you'll get it you receive it that way way and see just like those praying for the Holy Ghost this morning see to me somewhere God will meet you right and you'll say this day this scripture is fulfilled because it's a reality to you all right it depends on your attitude towards the word the word is the not the paper it's just a book but it's Christ made manifest on paper all right that's what it is God in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us see and his words are spirit and life look we just receive his word just like it was he himself now that's not letters on a page right people have argued that mankind wrote the word Prophet said I beg your pardon he said God wrote the word through the prophets all right but think about it we just receive his word just like it was he himself when I see his promise to me that's Christ I embrace it he can't lie to to me that's exactly the truth see I might not know how to take a hold of it but it's the truth and I hold that right I hold right with it because it's Christ to me now if you need healing ask God to reveal to you you're healed that's right and then when he revealed to you you life at the doctor but before he revealed it to you you're going to listen to what the doctor said right but see when it comes off the page into your heart now you got something that's right amen you don't have to worry about it that's true doctor tells you like he told me you going to take your kneecap off I said you don't never take my kneecap off he just laughed and said go on I'll take it off come that day it was you know with these operations they can do now you know and leave everything there back then it was just take it off and you you walk like Chester you you know he was STI fled because you didn't have no ni out but you say well who said that when he said it to you well evidently somebody besides me said it because I still have my legs you know my knaps all right now but listen to what he's saying all right going to the next one we just received his word just like it was he himself and you're going to get something when you get it that way amen all right look what he says here on Christ's mystery of God reveal paragraph 529 then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you that's the new birth right Jesus speaking of the Kingdom in you said the Bible Jesus the kingdom we're not a denomination we belong to a kingdom one watch and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and God was one now we don't I'm plain we don't believe this next wording and the word and God is one in his church today oh making it the headship well one of these days it'll be there you remember this morning on spoken words Original Seed where brother BR was said to be born by the word and spirit brings you back like you should have been in the beginning then if you have the new birth your soul is back like it should have been in the beginning that's right amen well I just don't know maybe brother Dale in a way brother R said it's not in a way right is either right it ain't right that's right look the word and God is one in his church today well one of these days brother de's going to come well he lied CU he said it's there today that's right well he was just deceiving you well he done a good job because I just kind of believe what he said look at making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and I thought brother Rand brought the message he's speaking of the church what are you looking now get off the garbage I explained it to start with you don't add to the word of God the prophet didn't add to the word of God it's got to be in the word of God so if he's saying that it's got to be in the word of God that's right Paul talks of the headship right to the people back there and it was their head we brother around spoke of a headship to come in the Statue of a perfect man called love all right now he's talking about that the head and the body is going to get together and bring the message we'll get down in a minute to the point and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning in the Garden of Eden the three-fold mystery of God in his body he said oh my so then it's got to be in you now how does the word get in you roll to the next one I'm trying to hurry so okay Satan's Eden 65829 paragraph 89 every seed will bring forth of its kind if you are a seed of God an attribute a Son of God then the word of God is sown in you come on see and then when you hear the word of God my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow you get it then every seed comes forth after its own kind the word has to be sown yes what did the prophet say I'm going sowing seed is that the way he said it you remember he was going overseas right and the Holy Spirit said don't go that's right or the people over there was really the ones that done it he said go back home and store up food he said I don't know what I'm doing but I'm so in and look at all the messages he stored up that he wouldn't stored up that he went overseas all right but look at it as for you and I look at the next one which is Christ revealed in his own word 65822 the morning service paragraph 91 and 92 and while to the while to the True Believer it's the revelation of God being revealed in the age we're living in now look what your Prophet says you remember only he could say my words are Spirit in life but when it's revealed to you come on when it's made known to you it's the same Rev ation that's right right when the word made known to you it's eternal life so look what he's saying it's revelation of God being revealed in the age you're living in he said my words are spirit and life Jesus said that again the word is the seed that a s sowed we know that that's true it's God in word form and can only be interpreted by himself so so brother around them can't interpret the word now don't get me all messed up I can quote with you too I know that Moses wrote the word but you better remember God interpreted amen right the human mind is not capable to interpret the mind of God how can the little finite mind interpret the infinite mind when we can't even interpret one another's mind right and you notice he is the only one can interpret it and he interprets it to whom he will it didn't say Mortals of old as they stred across the Earth in sura times and diverse manners God in Su times and diverse manners revealed himself to His prophets so then it's coming forth it's being revealed made known to you and I okay save time he says show us the father he said every word is a seed when to get to a point where we can get out of here all right but you know a seed has to be sown a seed has to be sown right I mean they had it in the Garners of Egypt laying there for thousands of years they took it out and put the moisture to it it produced right why because it was wheat seed it's necessary that the seed be sown right all right it's necessary to have a swer then right now the son of man SED the seed right and the son of man is the only s of the seed on go cuz that way you'll tie together every Prophet where they would be listed like Jeremiah son of man we know Jeremiah was not the son of man he was a son of man brother randam was not the son of man he was a son of man the Lord Jesus Christ Drew each one of those prophets right SED the seed for that age so he's going to have to keep on sowing it but he's got to have a vessel to sew that seed if he doesn't have a vessel then there's no sewing all right so now I didn't write these scriptures and it doesn't make one bit of word out of anything out of me any different it just makes the word right look at what brother R said I mean look what the scripture says Romans 10 go ahead number 14 right Romans 10:13 through 17 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved okay how can they call on him in whom they have not believed well I was just out and it just fell out of the sky no you heard something somebody as I said Mary heard from her mother Faith comth by hearing and hearing by the word right how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without without a preacher well bless God I got it myself I didn't get no preacher you heard the prophet's message he was the preacher you read the Bible he that was the preacher come on quit being silly oh boy I corrected him but I ain't heard it from nobody I've heard a lot of people say that that what I got nobody didn't give me I believed them I definitely believe that God didn't give it to him right you remember the the old man that was making fun of brother randman said there was some old hillbilly up in the mountain or something up in there give him that revelation of the of the serpent seed you know he said that's blaspheming the Holy Ghost but it wasn't that it was God bringing it right but look and how shall they hear without a preacher all right now watch and how shall they preach except they be sent now if they're not sent they are not Angel Messengers from God now remember Satan has ministers and he says they're even as Ministers of righteousness right he has his preachers that don't make nothing out of me because I say to be a preacher because that kills me if I don't follow what God says one of these days I'll get down to preaching I see cuz it's laying on my desk my wife gets on to me all the time but she won't move them they all staple together and waiting for sermon after sermon after sermon I've told you before the nine spiritual gifts are subject to people in the congregation brother BR said you can speak in tongues you prophesy he said don't make you a prophet he said God God use you one time never use you again Saul was listed with the prophets you know why cuz he got down and got on the spout and prophesied come on he what one of the prophets said the word come to but he said the fivefold ministry right is different from the nine spiritual gifts I believe everything you believe everything the prophet said let's sit down and talk a little while the five-fold ministry is predestinated as gifts from God to the congregation hey I'm number one to admit I wouldn't sit under some of them because I don't think they're they might be a preacher but they're not sent right amen I'm honest but you see as it is written look at the text that's my point of using all of this so let's read it and how shall they preach except to be sin that is written our beautiful I feet my old toenails is messed up so that's not pretty that preach the gospel of peace all right and bring Glad Tidings of good things right but they have not obeyed the gospel a lot of preachers don't preach the gospel why the prophet said preach don't teach people teach the word of God not preach it preaching is power and demonstration it's not signs and wonders it's a personal experience in your own life it's you telling how the candle got lit okay but they have not obeyed the gospel Isaiah said Lord who ha believed our report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God uh how can they hear without a preacher how can he preach Les he be sinned faith comes by hearing that's all in one text right right right so you got to have somebody right somebody that gets a revelation and speaks it all right we're doing good so we get to the next one this is God's provided way of approach to Fellowship 1960 709 uh E40 he's talking about scarlet and hiss Etc and water speaks of the spirit as speaks of the word and when the word and spirit get together something takes place now watch it when the true spirit of God can come in on the word that's being preached Faith cometh by hearing are you reading it when the true spirit of God can come can come in on the word that's being preached Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so if they're not sent they're not going to preach the truth and the Holy Spirit came for quick an error that's right well the Lord told me there's three Gods now you heard voices from somewhere else right there's no such thing I don't care how many angels you saw and how many things signs and wonders the Bible said if they give you a sign and it comes to pass but they tell you to another God don't hear them what when the true spirit of God can come in on the word that's being preached now I've told you this I keep telling you don't bother to me you can think what you want to the Lord spoke to me one day and he said you preach the truth and I'll back it up honestly as a human being I thought Lord I'm doing my best to preach the truth it took me quite a while to realize what he was saying just keep on preaching it just keep on preaching the truth and he said I'll bring it to pass now I had rather do what I've done this morning to the brother and sister that wanted to baptis with the Holy Ghost to just remind them of the word right and tell them what the word says tell them the way the prophet said those things and then let God speak to himen to Brother Gary he's listening this afternoon I hope CU he was still sick he knows that he would tell me I believe this I believe that I said that's fine Brother but that ain't the new birth you'll find out one day what it is and you'll call me but see Faith cometh by hearing Peter and him didn't give a great alar call scream and holler cry and pray two weeks and then get up and say no while Peter was preaching the word am I right the Holy Ghost fell on the people I'd rather have that than anything you can come up with I believe in shouting I believe in screaming crying praying I believe in every bit of it but I don't have to have that to believe God's word right I can believe the word and it'll take care of the rest of it you get the spirit now here let me read this one uh faith comes by hearing he by the word and the true Spirit me back down back okay it'll manifest itself every promise that God made it'll bring it to pass and make it so the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to viice if you could get the spirit with the word right right mental well I've got the right mental attitude let's God I'm sick I want to be healed ain't that the right mental attitude if you could get the spirit with the word amen amen then you real you're already healed all right look at the next one remember these are the things your Prophet is say things that are to be 1965 1205 paragraph 14 but I'm very thankful for these open doors that I had to go into he was preaching this in uh Rialto California that I had to go into and the inspiration it gives to young men like your pastor here that's caused them and I'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and watch you and know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord CU if he don't come in my generation he done looking for it these young men are going to take this message and sweep it on right somebody's going to take this message and keep expressing it one more a long reading but it's off the message believe in God 1952 224 preach in Jeffersonville I want you to watch what a preacher does I tried my best to explain this to you cuz this is all I can do I can't give you the Holy Ghost I can't do anything for you other than one thing and that's preach the gospel amen watch you the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was 12 years old it's your Prophet Godly Spirit hung over me a devil well now brother brother brandom uh you said that you would have saved at 12 well you always was eternal all you had to do is believe it come on I know that don't go good when I was 12 because the spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little while longer that's your reason you wasn't saved when you become the age of accountability nobody knows what the age of accountability is because it's according to your understanding right all right a spirit when you got with a crowd and that hovered over you it kept hanging over you you wanted to do right there's not a man that's got his right mind but what wants to do right but there's something won't let you do right is that right that's the devil and way right in the middle of telling you how bad it is he always Hallelujah Christ pids your healing in your salvation watching now here it is you get it that's not me that's him now here it is you get it he could commission his church cast out them Devils commission his church to cast them Devils out there you are in my name they shall cast out Devils you ain't going to heal nobody but you're going to cast The Devil away from them so they can accept the healing if I've already done that's right preacher stood on the platform and preached the gospel devil scattered listen man come to the alar under conviction I want to get saved he never saved the man he cast out the devil that's right and the man got saved he come accepted his salvation so you can cast that devil out that don't mean you're saved right the same thing he done by Divine Healing you sick people here this morning believe that and have been born again and they sons and daughters of God Christ has already healed you the only thing keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that you f won't fully let it go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's done it now we could stay all evening but I want want to read the rest of this you say I'm sick I need healing right plenty of it in the building I have it too what's wrong how many of you is honest enough to admit that line is right on what I just read what the only thing keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that won't that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promise that he's done it that's right am brother R preach the message casting out Devils is casting out unbelief it's just harder to get people to come to the Altar and you say well let me pray to cast the devil off of you first where I can pray for you to be healed that wouldn't go over too good would it but that's what he says he said to be healed confess your sins do you want that quotes that's right bless God I don't have no sin devil won't let you admit it right okay that's his words you talk to God about his Prophet look now that's my commission that's what give me God give me amen we believe that it's what he give every gospel preacher who will believe him do you believe that every gospel preach didn't say he gave it to every preacher did it he said he gave it to every gospel preacher all of them we read while ago that sent right okay look is what he gave every gospel preacher who will believe him what did he give him the power and authority to break that Spirit okay I believe with all of my heart every demon power that's in here this minute is already broken I do I believe that every sick person in here right now feels a lot different if that's right raise up your hand you who is sick see there you what's the matter that devil has broke away from you he has to Faith cometh by hearing and the hearing of the word Jesus Christ died for you what keeps us from being saved a devil y hanging over us what keeps us from being healed a devil but we don't want to admit that we got them Devils right and until we realize it's a devil Brother D I don't like you talk like that to me you telling me there's a devil they got a devil well the Lord Jesus said get behind me Satan was speaking to Peter that's right was it Peter or was it the devil in Peter the anointing guy on Peter which one was it right all right you see where we ought to say okay I'm confessing my sins I want you to pray for me to be healed I haven't sinned I'll have you to know you remember the lady that brother that Jack Cole said and she come up there and said I want to lay my tongue on the altar she said I've got a bad problem with a tongue he said ma'am it ain't possible said because his pull Pit's only 14 ft and said ain't enough room to lay your tongue now did she go home healed I doubt it amen don't you if you come up here to me this evening brother D we prayed for okay let's pray the devil off first now sister Kathy how would you like it if I said that to you I said the healing is no problem it's getting rid of the devil H how can they hear without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sinned so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word you said well the Bible already sold the prophet said these ministers will take this and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord he said and they'll break that spell I stand right here and preach I do not have discernment now there's a certain discernment goes with every preacher there's a certain discernment goes with every Born Again believer come on I mean there certain discernment goes with ever born again believer am I putting in the right place there's a certain discernment goes with preacher I stand right here sometimes and preach and I see that demon leave you but then I can say a word or two and I see it come back you know we used to live in a world that the pastor was I mean he' just take the kids out and give them a whooping right come on that right you know nobody didn't say a word bless God that need it you know I wouldn't do it today for nothing be in jail the next day now brother D I wouldn't put you in jail do you mind if I say I don't trust you that's not being funny that's telling the truth but you see all I can do is preach the gospel and when you see what I'm talking about you just lighten up you know now what have I told you a secret lot of you have been around here a long time I told you a secret a long time ago that goes with my Ministry cuz it goes with ever preacher's Ministry see I can break that spell that Satan has over your eyes but when God reveals something to you you're listening to a tape you're riding down a highway you are whatever in the middle of the night you wake up and God is speaking to you and things start being revealed to you raise your hands and say my family my children why cuz you're in a realm that you don't get in very often you admit that it's sweet as wonderful right while he's there with you right what I see here sometime I think raise your hands accept it you said Brother D I've seen that you just missed an opportunity maybe I shouldn't have told that because that is a secret that's right I can put it in other Realms because if you really a minister I can take my gift and sell fried ice cream to an Eskimo how many of you ever dealt with me about buying or something I make one price and I never tell you another one because I know what I can do with that gift I can get it out of you but that's using the gift wrong a man told me one day he said if I was interested talking about somebody else he said if I was interested in trying to get that girl to be my wife he said every time she turned around I'd be standing in front of her I thought oh God you just sold your gift you just sold your gift I'm not selling my gift I'm trying to help you with a gift amen if you see something say thank you Lord I see it then you'll be shouting right is that right sister Gail vacuuming or whatever she was doing in the kitchen living room just all at once something says there's just one God faith cometh by hearing you see why I preach so hard I want you to believe the word then God can take that word and Quicken it let's stand we won't even have any singing go to 20 after 3 we get done early you can go home and make sure and stay safe but we'll never go away without having a alter call if you want to come and then others can go home and we'll stay here with you so if you want to be prayed for come come and let do it I love him I weed yesterday about healing orever with a minute with him for a minute he said I see now what it is all right let's pray for that demon of unbelief to be took away yes sir that God can come and speak straight to you right that you're healed that's right cuz that's all I can do pray for the spirit to leave I can't heal you you think I wouldn't give this man here his eyesight if I had the ability but no but I can try to cast that demon of unbelief off and that's not making was God was Jesus making Peter a devil no no it was the devil hindering Peter father all we got is a gift it was GI to us thank you we didn't ask you for it we fought it like crazy trying to get away from it but yet we see what that gift really is thank you Lord It's Christ to the people if they can just believe it it's what he's given them thank you CU he said he gave some Apostles some prophets he gave us what we have need of Lord Jesus we just lay our hands on our brother to cast this demon of unbelief thank you Lord to break the spell that he has over our brother to keep him from just walking straight in and saying by his stripes I'm Healed he said it millions of times Lord but one more time in Jesus name amen we count it so go Hallelujah and see because it'll be made Manifest this problem with his leg so let's just believe it must believe that God is the Healer and if there's any problem of unbelief of anything we just try our best to cast that off to get us clear enough to where we can believe God lord Jesus our brother's got a problem with his leg we wish we could healing but father we can't but we can pray that that demon that would be in any hindrance around him would be taken away because that is the commission that you who gave the church in my name they shall cast out Devils we can't do it we're not a match for the devil but we have been given the prophet said power and authority how our mind would run and say oh we just got Authority
