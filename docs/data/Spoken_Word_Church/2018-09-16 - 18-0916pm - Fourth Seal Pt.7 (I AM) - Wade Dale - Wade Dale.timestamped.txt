[19:49] turn to revelation 6 and get started I
[19:50] hope this morning was clear and what we
[19:55] needed something that will help us along
[20:03] the way
[20:04] no ma'am it's just like some I said just
[20:12] gets good and gooder and really you know
[20:17] that's what we live off we live off a
[20:18] revelation sure we have to have natural
[20:21] food and sure we like worship anyone but
[20:23] we live off Revelation in the end time
[20:26] we really live live off Revelation
[20:28] because that's that's what's coming
[20:30] forth that's the box that we're supposed
[20:32] to be and we're supposed to understand
[20:34] this part that we're supposed to play
[20:36] all the others have played their parts
[20:38] all the others have finished their
[20:39] course they've they fought the good
[20:41] fight and they're resting waiting on you
[20:43] and I and to finish this fight and get
[20:46] this thing over with so we can come back
[20:49] for a millennium for a thousand years or
[20:51] just resting and man
[20:53] and I may know about the future home I'm
[20:55] talking about just getting to the
[20:56] millennium so we can all just rest for
[20:58] about a thousand years you know and just
[21:00] let everything unfold the way it unfolds
[21:02] so but we got to press the bottle now so
[21:05] revelation 6 verse 7 if they'll pull
[21:08] that up we'll get started this afternoon
[21:12] try to move into now I want to the title
[21:17] is now I am the resurrection in the life
[21:19] part 1 I thought we might get it done
[21:22] today but I don't think we can we
[21:24] there's too many parts to that so we're
[21:27] gonna stay on this until we have a
[21:29] resurrection and come ahead I hope so
[21:33] but let's bow our heads the Lord Jesus
[21:36] thank you for giving us another day an
[21:38] opportunity to speak to the best of the
[21:42] best the cream of the crop the number
[21:45] one concern of the bridegroom is the
[21:49] bride Lord we're here today Lord is just
[21:54] ones to hear from you Lord not to hear
[21:57] all the chatter that goes on in the
[22:00] world and all the things on the news and
[22:02] the weather and know we're here to hear
[22:04] from you Lord because whatever you say
[22:06] is eternal
[22:07] whatever you say has already been tried
[22:11] and proven and it is put into motion and
[22:17] a bride in the end time probably give us
[22:21] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[22:22] of our sins Lord bless the missionaries
[22:24] on the foreign fields give them fruit
[22:26] for their labor father just be with us
[22:28] today if there be any sick among us you
[22:29] said you sent your word and healed us
[22:31] and deliver us from destruction so Lord
[22:33] we pray that you would anoint us all
[22:37] anoint us all for this journey Lord to
[22:40] take us to that last push to get out of
[22:42] here because I believe that we are
[22:45] looking at the restoration of all things
[22:48] father just be with us and take care of
[22:51] us in Jesus name we pray amen and when
[22:54] he had opened the fourth seal I heard
[22:56] the voice of the fourth beast say come
[22:57] and see
[22:58] I looked and behold a pale horse in his
[23:01] name that sat on him was death now
[23:03] remember he was death during the whole
[23:04] time when he started he
[23:07] antichrist movement that was dead
[23:11] anything and tire against the word is
[23:13] dead so it started with death but it had
[23:17] come to where that the fourth church age
[23:19] I mean the fourth combat beef was the
[23:22] one that was going to give him a name
[23:23] and we'll talk about that in just a few
[23:25] minutes because look we got to know what
[23:27] we're fighting we got to know what we're
[23:30] fighting
[23:31] we're fighting death so we got to know
[23:33] what it is first you've got you you know
[23:35] if a guy's got a certain punch or if a
[23:36] guy's got a certain way of doing things
[23:39] football or anything you always look at
[23:42] the weakness of the team that you're
[23:43] playing you see the tendencies and you
[23:45] see what well the devil is pretty
[23:48] predictable so we ought to be able to
[23:50] understand though that one thing's for
[23:52] sure if it's anti-christ it's anti word
[23:56] and it's dead alright it's not coming to
[23:59] death it's already dead alright when
[24:01] Lucifer got cast out of heaven that was
[24:03] it because God told him said you were
[24:05] made perfect until iniquity was found in
[24:08] you and then that point from that point
[24:10] forward he was dead now who gives him
[24:12] the power we do we give him the power
[24:14] God permits him to work among us to try
[24:18] us but we're gonna come out as pure gold
[24:21] so that's what the Bible said and when
[24:23] he had opened the fourth seal I heard
[24:24] the voice of the fourth beast say come
[24:26] and see and I looked and beheld a pale
[24:28] horse and his name that sat on him was
[24:30] death and hell followed with him and
[24:32] power was given unto them over the
[24:33] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[24:35] the sword and with hunger and with death
[24:37] and with the beasts of the earth you may
[24:39] be seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[24:41] the reading of the word let's go ahead
[24:43] and read a few more scriptures while
[24:44] we're in it let's go to Joel to we were
[24:47] talking about this morning we've been
[24:49] reading this for a few Sundays and I
[24:52] want us to understand like I said this
[24:55] morning this is talking to you this is
[24:59] not a prophecy now it is a reality we
[25:04] have had the former rain no doubt we've
[25:09] had the former rain it came as a
[25:11] teaching rain through eleven hundred and
[25:14] something sermons from the prophet of
[25:15] God and then that was the teaching rain
[25:19] that came down
[25:21] on the people to teach them something
[25:24] but now that's okay if you plant you
[25:27] know you can you can plant a garden and
[25:29] it can come up like we were talking
[25:32] about this morning and it can grow and
[25:33] it can mature but what good is it unless
[25:37] you harvest it what good is that you can
[25:41] have oh I've got a thousand acres of
[25:43] corn well a year later you're gonna say
[25:47] I got a thousand acres of corn no
[25:50] something's gonna happen to it you got
[25:52] to harvest that corn it's not gonna feed
[25:54] nobody amen
[25:56] so what same way with this when we come
[25:58] here and we see that be glad you
[26:00] children of Zion and rejoicing the Lord
[26:02] your God for he hath given you the
[26:06] former rain moderately and he will cause
[26:09] to come down for you the rain you the
[26:13] former rain and the latter rain in the
[26:15] first month so we see this coming in a
[26:17] very short period of time so the former
[26:20] rain is the teaching rain we've had that
[26:21] and we're having this continually now
[26:24] but it came to us in one rain the
[26:28] prophet of God rained eleven hundred and
[26:29] something sermons down on us and then
[26:32] the teaching rain and now from that
[26:34] there's going to be a harvest and the
[26:37] harvest is what the rapture all right so
[26:41] the harvest is the rapture but there's a
[26:42] lot goes on in between you've got a
[26:45] harvest at first there's got to be a
[26:48] resurrection or a harvest of the earth
[26:51] before we take a rapture and then we've
[26:55] been talking about that I'm not worried
[26:57] about a rapture anymore I don't even I
[26:59] don't even think about it well I think
[27:04] about something that's not going to
[27:05] happen unless this happens first a man I
[27:08] mean a German chocolate cake
[27:10] uh-huh uh-huh now y'all will get happy
[27:13] there - tail wagging say Amen hallelujah
[27:15] now write German chocolate shake about
[27:17] 20 of you in so maybe I'll mention
[27:22] German chocolate cake in about 20
[27:24] minutes and it'll wait some of you up
[27:28] but my mom can make the best German
[27:30] chocolate cake in the world but you know
[27:32] what she has to get this ingredient and
[27:34] that ingredient and this ingredient and
[27:36] she has to put it together and she has
[27:39] to baking in an oven other than that you
[27:41] know what I would not eat Germans
[27:43] honking Kate if it wasn't put together
[27:45] because all it is is what powdered this
[27:48] powdered that an egg flour thank you
[27:53] coconut I finished coconut caramel
[27:59] chocolate nuts you know scatter at
[28:03] coconut Oh cocoa all that scatter up
[28:05] have you ever eat tried to eat cocoa
[28:06] you're making a point here you know
[28:08] cocoa is horrible but in the German
[28:10] chocolate cake it's really good so it
[28:13] takes somebody to cook this all up take
[28:17] this and this and this and cook it
[28:18] together and make one beautiful cake and
[28:20] that's what I believe is happening now
[28:21] that we're bringing we've had the formal
[28:24] ain't rain and we it's raining now but
[28:27] it's raining to bring a harvest alright
[28:29] and the harvest is all of us and the
[28:32] floor shall be full of weed and the
[28:33] facts shall overflow with wine and oil
[28:35] and I will restore to you the years that
[28:38] the locust has eaten the cankerworm the
[28:39] counter pill their pommel were my great
[28:41] army which I sent among you and that's
[28:42] the four beasts that eat it down all

[29:03] one little piece of cake I'll never

[29:20] Reed one time when I went over to
[29:22] Jamaica that's only like what there's
[29:23] about thirty
[29:24] so 40 maybe in the whole thing what he
[29:29] done was I saw him like eight months
[29:31] later I went back to Jamaica he had not

[29:36] of you and I'll take one and I'll eat
[29:38] one when they meet me and Daniel eat one
[29:40] and the day sometimes I eat two or three
[29:42] in the day but you see what I'm saying
[29:44] he let it last because it was good so
[29:47] that's what we're doing now we're
[29:48] letting it last out with letting that
[29:50] German chocolate cake last oh sure we
[29:53] want to you know gobble it up but gods
[29:56] give us 60 years of eating the Germans

[30:07] into people and then we're gonna get out
[30:10] of here and ma'am but we got to get the
[30:13] people out of the ground first and you

[31:05] resurrection a resurrection comes from a
[31:08] live ministry a live group of people
[31:11] have to stand the angels were standing
[31:14] in them in the tomb and said why seek ye
[31:17] the living among the dead
[31:20] in other words what these dead people
[31:22] are not proclaiming the resurrection
[31:25] it's a live people that proclaims the
[31:27] resurrection it's a lot of people that
[31:29] gets those people out of the ground amen
[31:32] it's nonsense of the other one

[31:42] from you it will have to come from some
[31:45] voice live voice alright let's turn
[31:51] right here

[32:03] Son of Man cool that's what we're gonna

[32:22] this morning
[32:23] that's our anointing to this age is to
[32:26] know what the Son of Man is know who he
[32:29] is Noah's characteristic and know that
[32:31] he's here amen because without him being
[32:35] here he's the one that says I am the
[32:37] resurrection and the life
[32:39] and then Martha didn't say it Peter
[32:41] didn't say it Paul didn't say it
[32:43] jesus said it the Son of Man all right
[32:48] but he had to be spoken through somebody
[32:52] you know I'll prove it to you brother
[32:53] branham said it so I'll just let you
[32:55] hear him saying but jesus said verily I
[32:58] saying to you except a corn of wheat
[33:00] fall into the ground and die now I just
[33:03] fall into the ground it's got to die all
[33:05] right member who I said Jesus his body
[33:08] laid in that tomb in Jerusalem
[33:13] did there was no life in that body none
[33:18] zero and if it hadn't have been for the
[33:21] scripture about corruption it would have
[33:23] corrupted because it was a human body
[33:26] but that human body man stood there one
[33:29] day at the tomb of Lazarus bring the
[33:31] next one up but if I die bringing forth
[33:33] life John 11:21 then martha sent in
[33:36] jesus lord if thou hadst been here my
[33:38] brother had not died but i know that
[33:42] even now what something to look she look
[33:44] what she's confessing and watch her lose
[33:46] it to scriptures he just took her to to
[33:51] lose it but I know that even now
[33:55] whatsoever thou will ask of God God will
[33:59] give it to thee now she didn't believe
[34:00] that Jesus said that brother she arrives
[34:04] the end months it says I know that he's
[34:06] arrives in the resurrection at the last
[34:07] day she just proved right then she
[34:10] didn't believe who he was at the moment
[34:13] Martha said I know that he should see
[34:15] that's like us we're like well the
[34:18] resurrection you know that's that's
[34:22] coming up it is for another group no
[34:24] here's your box this is my box I have a
[34:30] resurrection box so that's what we're
[34:32] declared to declare were to declare the
[34:34] resurrection amen and we'll get into
[34:37] that next Sunday I want you to kind of
[34:39] think on the sign of the Son of Man will
[34:41] read a little bit of it this afternoon
[34:43] at the very end but the sign of the son
[34:45] of man not the sign of the son of God
[34:47] the sign of the son of man all right
[34:50] jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[34:52] rise again Martha sending him I know
[34:54] that he shall rise again in the
[34:56] resurrection the last thing in other
[34:57] words she was saying I believe what you
[35:00] just said but I don't really believe
[35:02] what you just said but you know what she
[35:05] done she put her own interpretation to
[35:07] it thy brother shall rise again Jesus
[35:13] was saying right then
[35:14] Martha was saying O Lord I know he's
[35:16] going to come up in the resurrection
[35:18] that's not what Jesus was talking about
[35:20] because what jesus said unto her
[35:25] and the resurrection and the life right
[35:28] I am the resurrection and the life he
[35:31] that believeth on me though he were dead
[35:35] you got to be dead to have a
[35:37] resurrection amen
[35:40] you got to have a death before you can
[35:42] have a resurrection we're talking about
[35:44] this morning death before life you got
[35:47] to have a death before life even in the
[35:48] spiritual room you got to have a death
[35:50] before you have a life and whosoever
[35:52] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[35:55] die believe us now this believe it's now
[35:59] this amen
[36:01] I am the resurrection and the life
[36:06] now remember then we come to the break
[36:11] into the seals and we won't show this
[36:13] chart up again but the breaking of the
[36:14] seals then takes us to that point to
[36:18] where that resurrection has to happen
[36:19] and I said it has to happen because once
[36:23] everything is lined up the resurrection
[36:25] has to take place and then and then when
[36:28] the resurrection take place then the
[36:30] rapture has to take place you see what
[36:32] I'm saying so let's get the first first
[36:34] let's get the resurrection because look
[36:37] in this fourth seal death has to be
[36:39] destroyed
[36:40] listen before before that fourth seal
[36:43] broke even brother branham later on
[36:45] after he said after he preached that he
[36:47] said now you know remember he preached
[36:49] why I'm against organized religion in
[36:51] 1959 but in the opening of the seals
[36:54] which I believe was the fourth seal
[36:55] because it named death he knew where
[36:58] death was coming from it was coming from
[37:01] them denominational ideas and all that
[37:03] the people ran and then he says now I
[37:05] know why I was against that thing why
[37:08] because he can name it by dirt listen
[37:13] let me make it as strong as I make it
[37:16] John Wesley stood and preached a
[37:18] Trinitarian doctrine baptizing name of
[37:22] Father Son Holy Ghost is that right
[37:25] he was church aged messenger that was
[37:28] his box but that was death that was
[37:34] death that wasn't life over if father
[37:39] son Holy Ghost was created out of the
[37:41] pits of hell how is it that eternal he
[37:43] can't be
[37:44] but God allowed it or permitted it
[37:47] because John Wesley was preaching
[37:48] sanctification of the vessel Luther
[37:53] justification of the vessel
[37:55] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[37:57] Ghost they have their time to work in
[37:59] and that's all because they truly were
[38:03] preaching life but it was death now
[38:07] because it was named now in this four
[38:10] churches with the Eagle anointing we now
[38:13] see that what they called life is now
[38:16] death to me and you that all right
[38:18] that's why we got to come up we got to
[38:20] keep lifting up higher because John
[38:22] Weston can never bring anything out any
[38:24] anything in John Wesley's message though
[38:26] he was a powerful man great man just a
[38:29] cleat it gave me a book to read him or
[38:31] read about cuz I'd never read about John
[38:32] Wesley I want to read about him but a
[38:34] powerful man but nothing he preached
[38:38] brought a resurrection
[38:39] oh sure a resurrection of out of out
[38:43] resurrection of coming up out of dead
[38:45] works and all those things but remember
[38:47] if we took his message and just late on
[38:49] it it be dead does amen
[38:54] so death has to be destroyed then in the
[38:58] word that's already
[39:00] John Wesley didn't read another
[39:01] different Bible than we did he read the
[39:04] same Bible but he didn't it wasn't
[39:10] required a resurrection in his time it
[39:13] wasn't required a resurrection in
[39:15] Pentecost
[39:16] it was declared now a resurrection in
[39:19] this end time amen
[39:22] a resurrection has to take place
[39:26] then the rapture takes place on that
[39:28] fourth seal but the rapture cannot take
[39:30] place without a resurrection first in
[39:33] man so that's why I'm saying I'm not
[39:35] belittling the rapture but the rapture
[39:37] is kind of a culmination of all these
[39:39] other things happen but all these other
[39:42] things got to happen first you can't
[39:44] just say oh I'm going into rapture well
[39:47] if you got the resurrection sign in your
[39:49] life have you got the resurrection sign
[39:54] in your life someday you better so then
[40:00] a resurrection is what we need we need
[40:02] to look at the what the sign of the son
[40:04] of man the resurrection sign German
[40:07] chocolate cake yeah there you go Timbo
[40:11] wake up Jim all the rest of y'all we got
[40:15] German chocolate cake go through the
[40:19] recipe
[40:20] it'll keep you awake just say chocolate
[40:24] most of you'll start shouting yeah help
[40:30] us on so the breaking of these seals
[40:34] though is the restoration of all things
[40:37] everything has to come back to the
[40:39] Gentile dispensation you hear what I'm
[40:41] saying because I that's my boss my box
[40:45] is not in Israel what happens there is
[40:51] rose okay and it will happen to me
[40:54] because I'm spiritual Israel but my box
[40:56] is take a physical resurrection and a
[41:01] physical coming of age and a physical
[41:06] leaving here so that God can go to the
[41:09] Jews and do what he's supposed to do in
[41:11] the box of the two witnesses 1260 days
[41:14] right there and then you know what they
[41:18] disappear God watch the earth off and we
[41:22] all come back you know what we can shout
[41:25] about that that's okay but let's find
[41:27] out what we need to do now to get us
[41:31] there
[41:31] if we don't know what we're doing now we
[41:34] sure not going to be there but we will
[41:37] know because it's a promise
[41:39] that's a sign of the Son of Man will
[41:41] come back the resurrection sign got it
[41:46] for next Sunday we won't read it this
[41:48] Sunday but the resurrection sign had to
[41:51] come from the son of man he's the only
[41:55] one that's took a resurrection and a
[41:58] body change now there's been other
[42:01] resurrections okay don't catch me now
[42:02] there's been other resurrection Lazarus
[42:05] when he said I am the resurrection and
[42:06] the life and he brought Lazarus back to
[42:08] life every what lifetime that Lazarus
[42:11] lived he died and then even Abraham when
[42:16] Abraham got his body changed which is
[42:18] what we're supposed to to be our body
[42:20] change and be our example he died you
[42:25] and I that's not true for us when we
[42:30] take a resurrection Jesus when he
[42:32] stepped out of that tomb he didn't die
[42:35] twenty years later of 50 years later
[42:37] he's still alive they matter he is
[42:40] absolutely standing in an immortal body
[42:43] the body he lived on this earth in I
[42:49] said the body he lived on his earth in
[42:52] he's standing in it today but listen
[43:02] brothers and sisters you are the
[43:04] restoration of this whole thing it does
[43:07] not hinge on no other person but you
[43:10] know one God can't trust his word with
[43:14] nobody else but it's bride that's all I
[43:17] didn't say that I'm just telling you
[43:19] what he said hey you know what that's
[43:21] great because you know what then we can
[43:22] focus in on our box resurrection listen
[43:30] if it don't happen soon if they're
[43:36] accurate I mean for resurrect you don't
[43:38] have them soon
[43:38] there's some of you that we're gonna
[43:40] have to say we're waiting on the
[43:42] resurrection right
[43:46] no brother you ain't no more one than I
[43:49] am I could drop dead in two seconds but
[43:54] leave it at that
[44:00] who's that oh you're the rest you are
[44:02] the resurrection so you are the
[44:04] restoration which will bring on a
[44:06] resurrection so the resurrection is sign
[44:10] has got to come into a group of people
[44:13] we saw it just and we'll talk about it
[44:15] more next Sunday we saw it in listen
[44:18] brother Brown said what you saw in part
[44:22] you'll see in fullness one day that was
[44:26] part that was part here what I'm saying
[44:33] those prayer lines and all those
[44:35] thousands and hundreds of thousands of
[44:37] healings and and eyeballs being restored
[44:41] that's what he was talking about that
[44:43] was in part Amen but what was he
[44:48] prophesying of a fullness to come where
[44:51] brother BAM said limbs would be restored
[44:54] listen those Morton limbs got to be
[44:56] restored in you and I abraham's lamb
[45:00] wasn't restored his whole body was
[45:02] restored amen
[45:04] but you know what it takes the same
[45:06] power God doesn't have to you know how
[45:11] we do we have to we have to kind of work
[45:13] the motor up and you know God don't have
[45:15] to work the motor up no more to destroy
[45:16] this whole world than it does to give
[45:18] you eternal life it doesn't matter to
[45:19] him he's not nervous when this happens
[45:22] he has no ups and down he's just Lee he
[45:26] knows what's gonna happen so he's just
[45:27] he even kill you and I need to know if
[45:29] you and I know what's coming
[45:32] we had a prophet come and tell us what's
[45:34] coming every step like Bernie says we
[45:37] have read tomorrow's headlines today we
[45:41] know what's coming now we might know not
[45:43] names and dates but we know what's
[45:45] coming
[45:46] amen but we did not know let's go to the
[45:49] next one we did not know about this
[45:51] spiritual death until this seal broke
[45:54] because remember he fooled the whole
[45:56] world Satan fooled the
[45:59] whole world at Nicaea bringing in the
[46:02] Father Son Holy Ghost baptism remember
[46:04] folks that never come from God eternal
[46:09] hell never came from God all those false
[46:13] doctrines listen you can't put that on
[46:15] God but he allowed it because he knew he
[46:19] had to restore listen I know it's bad to
[46:26] be sick I've never been real sick
[46:30] like maybe brother digging something
[46:32] like bailout something y'all been pretty
[46:33] sick right I know that I did too but to
[46:41] be real sick and then all of a sudden
[46:42] you come out of it and you get better
[46:46] even in that little small that we just
[46:49] talked about right now there's a glory
[46:51] in them amen but that just speaks like
[46:55] brother Brown said this is just a little
[46:57] part what you see in part you'll see in
[47:00] the fullness one day when there's no ebb
[47:03] and flow in our bad days and good days
[47:06] we're coming to a resurrection to where
[47:10] we may have sure we may have hard times
[47:12] but man to see Robert Tatum come through
[47:16] the door though the Gary brother Rita
[47:21] Marlowe all the ones and I don't want to
[47:24] leave anybody out but just to keep going
[47:25] through your mom and dad all the what a
[47:27] joy
[47:28] don't you think Germans have UK times a
[47:34] hundred but you know what it's going to
[47:39] do though this is what I'm just telling
[47:42] you this is what I see we may get to our
[47:45] darkest time and that may be the time
[47:47] that God brings in through the door and
[47:49] then buddy you talk about a spark so we
[47:52] know though we ain't got but 3040 days
[47:56] because remember we've which are alive
[47:58] and remain shall not prevent or hinder
[48:00] we'll get into this in a couple of weeks
[48:01] those which are asleep for the trumpet
[48:04] of God will sound and they shall rise
[48:06] what first
[48:07] and then we which are here in other
[48:10] words will be changed so we're going to
[48:13] be that's see that's what always
[48:14] bothered me is talking about this
[48:15] morning about Jesus or about me you say
[48:19] well the resurrection is in me
[48:20] resurrection didn't mean you know I mean
[48:24] as bad as you feel brother dick I don't
[48:26] care how many of these right here you
[48:28] got the resurrections in me you got that
[48:31] right brother it sure is
[48:33] what are we looking at we're looking at
[48:35] what symptoms and circumstances Jesus
[48:39] probably didn't feel good that day in
[48:41] his humanity
[48:42] he'd been four days journey and he cried
[48:44] afterwards so he probably had been
[48:46] having a hard time but he stood and he
[48:48] says I Know Who I am
[48:49] I am the resurrection and the life so it
[48:53] may be that we get down to a low point
[48:55] but then we just one day something
[48:57] inside catches the hold and we say hey
[49:01] you know what
[49:02] Robert Tatum I just man brother Tatum
[49:06] always money and he just I just call his
[49:08] name first but you know what I'm tired
[49:10] of missing Robert Tatum Lord says I'll
[49:14] give you the desire of your heart you
[49:15] just speak it and I said Robert Tatum
[49:17] walked through that door he'll give you
[49:19] a desire of your heart every one of us
[49:22] are connected with somebody's past home
[49:23] so what if you call their name because
[49:26] you're connected to them and then they
[49:29] walk through the door would that be too
[49:34] far-fetched no that's German chocolate
[49:36] cake let's rename this sermon all right
[49:44] everybody okay but this has become a
[49:47] reality this is not a fantasy world that
[49:48] we're living in God has never been a
[49:51] fantasize er he's never been an
[49:53] imaginary he never whatever God puts in
[49:55] his mind he don't imagine it because
[49:58] you're knocking say well I imagine
[49:59] tomorrow I'm gonna get up and I don't
[50:02] know what I'm gonna eat God doesn't do
[50:04] that well soon as he thinks and it comes
[50:05] to pass and it's perfect you say well
[50:10] that's God I thought he lived in you
[50:13] hmm huh I thought he lived in you and we
[50:17] supposed to let him be in control amen
[50:20] spoken words regional seed spiritual
[50:23] death that was both physical and
[50:26] spiritual with Eve who were talking
[50:28] about this this morning but I will read
[50:29] it again first at any time I told you
[50:31] and asked you this morning sister to
[50:33] forgive me so I can mention it anytime a
[50:35] woman takes the wrong step I'm talking
[50:37] about Christ in the bride now but
[50:39] anytime a woman takes the wrong steps
[50:40] she has to first receive it in her mind
[50:42] it was not a sex act in the garden that
[50:45] killed mankind Eve had to first accept
[50:53] it in her mind because look Mary had to
[50:56] first accept it in her mind Mary said be
[51:01] it unto me according to thy word and
[51:03] something clicked she was pregnant no
[51:12] act at all hmm no act at all she
[51:18] actually had to wait about thirty days
[51:20] to figure out she's pregnant so she was
[51:24] believing through that time had to be
[51:27] because she lost her confessions you and
[51:28] the guy amen mmm so that's why you and I
[51:31] 50 years we got to hold this confession
[51:34] and then that the property God's right
[51:36] what he said was right he was a true
[51:39] prophet not a false prophet he was
[51:41] somebody that the only way we only get
[51:43] to God is through that man we couldn't
[51:47] understand without it but anytime a
[51:52] woman takes the wrong steps she has to
[51:54] first receive it in her mind right some
[51:56] slicker has to persuade her and she
[51:58] listens to against her own better
[51:59] judgment than the act is committed so
[52:02] first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind and in
[52:07] the womb of her mind she doubted God's
[52:09] Word then came the actual act all right
[52:13] and the only way that we can ever be
[52:16] born again listen to this is what was
[52:17] from I this morning you said well
[52:19] brother Dale has been preaching on this
[52:20] for a year he could have read this one
[52:22] quote and be done with it if we'd
[52:24] believe it but no we have to get all
[52:26] the German chocolate cake recipe
[52:27] together all right and the only way that
[52:29] we can ever be born again first in the
[52:34] womb of the mind receive the word and
[52:38] then the Spirit comes on top of that and
[52:42] brings it to life brings walk to life
[52:44] the word that you help to me that's the
[52:48] simplest thing in the world why do
[52:49] people have to come complicate this
[52:51] whole thing just born with this and you
[52:54] didn't have that news always was it I
[52:56] think he just told us what it is right
[52:58] there in the womb of your mind you got
[53:01] to receive the word then the Spirit
[53:03] comes on top of that and brings it to
[53:05] life that's where the new birth comes
[53:10] from because your first life is
[53:12] worthless you sign you first let your
[53:16] mom and Daddy brought you here by an act
[53:18] and you're dying just what is but on the
[53:22] new birth born again the Spirit comes on
[53:26] top of that what the word and brings it
[53:29] to life there you are that's what does
[53:30] it that's the real gospel teaching
[53:32] brother I believe st. Paul was here he'd
[53:34] teach the same thing you wouldn't have
[53:37] to shout German chocolate cake de pollo
[53:38] I promise number one me probably number
[53:43] two unveiling of God let's read some of
[53:45] these that were read this morning for
[53:47] the sake of of repeating ourselves
[53:50] they spiritually die now this is a
[53:52] spiritual veil now what's he talking
[53:54] about the unveiling of God he's talking
[53:56] about the natural veil in the temple
[53:58] there was a natural veil in the temple
[54:01] but now it's the spiritual veil they
[54:04] keep walking right on in it cuz look and
[54:06] you don't have to go behind the natural
[54:08] veil it's a spiritual veil all right
[54:10] they keep walking right on in behind
[54:13] there you can tell them oh I know I know
[54:15] but but you see go ahead that's all
[54:16] right
[54:17] it only speaks you remember the last
[54:19] plague in Egypt was death before the
[54:21] Exodus now it's telling us what the
[54:23] life's plates going to be because
[54:24] remember the Exodus is type of us
[54:26] getting out of Egypt amen alright the
[54:29] last plague on earth a spiritual death
[54:31] before the Exodus then they'll be
[54:34] cremated and turn back to the dust and
[54:36] the righteous will walk out upon their
[54:37] ashes but the last thing is spiritual
[54:39] death
[54:40] what rejecting the word alright now look
[54:44] let's look on the fourth seal I haven't
[54:45] read this one before let's read this one
[54:47] I like this and they look what happened
[54:49] this is where the death come from the
[54:53] fourth seal 1963 notice it's Christ the
[54:56] antichrist refuses the true somebody say
[55:00] that word for me the trick that was weak
[55:03] the what doctrine you saw I thought that
[55:08] was brother Browning's doctor not
[55:10] something are we foolish
[55:12] it's our doctrine it's what we live by
[55:16] and brother Brown says the Antichrist
[55:18] refuses the true bride doctrine
[55:21] therefore he takes his own bride down
[55:24] and builds her up under a creed of his
[55:27] own takes his own bride and makes her
[55:30] denomination she gives birth to other
[55:33] denominations that's quoted in this holy
[55:35] scripture gives birth to daughters he's
[55:37] talking about revelation and she don't
[55:39] she becomes just like her mother
[55:41] natural world we denominational opposing
[55:45] the spiritual bride comma the word so
[55:48] the spiritual bride in the end time is
[55:50] what the word and then the spiritual
[55:53] bride in the end time is a word and we
[55:55] have connected ourselves to that so that
[55:58] makes us the Word made flesh and then
[56:01] that all right all right now let's go to
[56:04] I will restore we'll read it this
[56:06] morning but let's read this one right
[56:11] here cuz I didn't read him this morning
[56:12] for sealed now you see he was cast out
[56:17] of the earth and becomes incarnate as
[56:19] the Antichrist spirit become incarnate
[56:22] into a man that man changes from one
[56:25] thing to another from an antichrist
[56:27] spirit to a false prophet and then to
[56:29] the Beast comes then the Beast comes
[56:31] into him just exactly like the church
[56:33] growth his church went from Antichrist
[56:36] the false prophet in the great age to
[56:37] come the Beast that is to rise up so the
[56:40] church comes the same way through
[56:42] justification see if you take the seals
[56:45] you have to take the plan of redemption
[56:47] to understand the opening of the seals
[56:50] is not to understand the Antichrist and
[56:52] all that
[56:53] it's to understand Jesus Christ and what
[56:56] he's already brought because how many
[56:57] times did I read y'all while we were
[56:59] going through the first part of the
[57:01] seals where brother Brown says this is a
[57:03] book of redemption the book that was
[57:04] open and the book that was in the hand
[57:06] of the owner was what not a book of the
[57:09] devil
[57:10] it was a book of Jesus Christ the
[57:12] redemptive plan when when when Jesus
[57:16] Christ took that book in Revelations 5
[57:18] that wasn't a book to reveal the devil
[57:20] that was a book to reveal you cuz you
[57:24] were in the book remember it was a book
[57:27] of redemption
[57:29] so these seals have two parallel
[57:31] Redemption he seals our Redemption but
[57:35] through justification sanctification and
[57:37] baptism the Holy Ghost as Christ being
[57:39] in the people just exactly and he's got
[57:42] the anti-type off over there see the top
[57:44] of it rather there he is just exactly
[57:47] that's him kicked out of heaven talking
[57:49] about Satan alright so now let's read
[57:52] Ezekiel again but let's condense it down
[57:54] a little bit because I want to make a
[57:55] comment right here afterwards I won't
[57:57] let you let I'm gonna let brother
[57:59] branham I found a quote just a few
[58:01] minutes ago and we inserted it it's the
[58:02] one that y'all got extra just a few
[58:05] minutes ago
[58:06] Ezekiel 37 says this is about the valley
[58:10] of dry bones we were talking about this
[58:11] morning for those of you who weren't
[58:12] here you got bones you got sinew you got
[58:18] skin you got life
[58:19] so there's your four stages to fourth
[58:21] and I'm gonna let brother Brown tell you
[58:22] that you mouth all I said that but I'm
[58:24] gonna let brother I'm tell you then then
[58:26] said he unto me prophesy into the wind
[58:29] prophesy son a man son of man say to the
[58:33] wind dust that the Lord God come from
[58:36] the four winds four winds lying ox man
[58:38] and eagle old breathe and breath and
[58:41] breathe Oh breath and breathe upon these
[58:44] slain that they may live so I prophesied
[58:48] as he commanded now I believe brother
[58:50] Branham prophesied as he was commanded
[58:52] because brother brown was a prophet that
[58:55] makes him a prophesy he prophesied what
[58:58] he was prophesying to me and you people
[59:00] to come that's what people don't get
[59:04] brother Branham was preaching to that
[59:06] overlap
[59:07] coming out of Pentecost they had their
[59:10] box but their boss wasn't resurrection
[59:13] their box was live a good Christian life
[59:17] so what brother Bram said on the sixth
[59:19] seal he said it's gone from you it's not
[59:20] for you but you do have a box he said
[59:24] now you go on and live a good simple
[59:25] Christian life you know what he said
[59:28] told them to do that live a good simple
[59:30] Christian life because remember the
[59:32] seals are really not to show you how to
[59:34] live a good Christian life
[59:36] there'll be millions of people bride
[59:39] bride they'd never heard of seal priest
[59:43] Paul never heard him Paul was dead
[59:45] before John even went departments but
[59:48] you and I I hope you get this you and I
[59:51] it was commissioned for us to see this
[59:54] that's why all the prophets wanted to
[59:56] see this day they could just barely see
[59:59] a little piece of it but it was me and
[1:00:01] you they were looking at that ain't
[1:00:07] Germans on the gate that's something far
[1:00:11] greater
[1:00:12] so I prophesied as he commanded me now
[1:00:15] we know that but who was he breathing on
[1:00:23] he's breathing now he's breathing the
[1:00:27] breath of life into those dry bones
[1:00:31] right now and they lived and stood up
[1:00:37] upon their feet we're not gonna take a
[1:00:40] resurrection laying down the
[1:00:42] resurrection is upright just like this
[1:00:45] all right an exceeding great army then
[1:00:50] he said unto me son of man these bones
[1:00:54] are the whole house of Israel now
[1:00:57] remember we're spiritual Israel so we
[1:00:59] get this first and then behold they say
[1:01:03] our bones are dried and our hope is lost
[1:01:06] we are cut off for our parts therefore
[1:01:12] prophesy and say unto them thus saith
[1:01:15] the Lord God behold O my people I will
[1:01:19] open up your grave and cause you to come
[1:01:22] out of your graves and bring you into
[1:01:25] the Land of Israel and you shall know
[1:01:29] that i am the lord when i have opened
[1:01:31] your graves all my people and brought
[1:01:33] you out of your graves and she'll put my
[1:01:35] spirit in you and you shall live and i
[1:01:38] shall place you in your own land
[1:01:40] then shall you know that I the LORD have
[1:01:43] spoken it and performed it saith the
[1:01:46] Lord now let's read what brother Branham
[1:01:48] said about them restoration of the bride
[1:01:51] tree I just found this a few minutes ago
[1:01:53] and I want you to lift it right here
[1:01:58] they're got five oh nine four four
[1:02:01] killers took it pommel worm locusts
[1:02:05] caterpillar and I can't remember the
[1:02:07] cankerworm I hate them kangaroo horrible
[1:02:11] four killers took it for messengers
[1:02:15] destroyed it
[1:02:16] four messengers of death took it away in
[1:02:19] dogma see brother Branham now he's
[1:02:22] telling it heat it at this point the
[1:02:24] seals weren't open it's right before
[1:02:26] right or that's that yeah it was right
[1:02:29] before 63 he didn't know to call it
[1:02:31] death there was not a name for it he
[1:02:34] called it Dogma four messengers of
[1:02:37] righteousness restore her back again
[1:02:39] line ox man and eagle prophesy Son of
[1:02:44] Man now watch he's going right back to
[1:02:45] the scripture we read can these bones
[1:02:48] live wish we had time well you know what
[1:02:51] we got time now I got it wrote down here
[1:02:53] but I have to miss that prophesy can
[1:02:55] these bones live watch the four stages
[1:02:58] of that coming fourth of that church
[1:03:02] right watch the four stages of Ezekiel's
[1:03:06] dry bones coming forth but the life only
[1:03:09] come not when the sinew skin was on them
[1:03:12] but when the wind blowed upon them
[1:03:14] that's when come back that fourth
[1:03:18] message of life that's when come back
[1:03:23] that fourth message of life I will
[1:03:27] restore say oh I like it cool how
[1:03:31] Oh glory praise be to God the forth
[1:03:33] light is to come that will bring forth
[1:03:35] the same signs watch justification
[1:03:39] Brotman what have we been talking about
[1:03:40] the whole time in the seal justification
[1:03:42] Saints catching baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:03:43] and then the word being made flesh ghost
[1:03:45] he's got to come to fore he's got to
[1:03:48] come to for justification brought back
[1:03:51] to pulp sanctification brought back to
[1:03:53] bark doctrine of holiness walk bought
[1:03:55] breakfast what brought back to leaf
[1:03:59] Pentecostal what is it Pentecostals
[1:04:02] leave clapping their hands joy oh they
[1:04:04] did they had a great time God was with
[1:04:07] those people but when they said in the
[1:04:12] womb of their mind said this is it we
[1:04:15] don't handle more of that see that swing
[1:04:17] guard said all right I've had enough of
[1:04:19] that I'm going on he didn't say that was
[1:04:22] false he said I've had enough of that
[1:04:23] and I'm going on there was no resin you
[1:04:26] know what you know what God is looking
[1:04:29] for you know what God is looking for
[1:04:33] he's looking for somebody to believe
[1:04:37] that they have the resurrection inside
[1:04:38] of them
[1:04:39] he has not found it until today he
[1:04:44] looked in the Pentecostals he said aha
[1:04:46] great great great
[1:04:47] oh man why did y'all do that of course
[1:04:50] he knew from the fountain here's the
[1:04:51] world they were going to but you know
[1:04:53] God is long-suffering if God went
[1:04:55] long-suffering why didn't he just cut
[1:04:56] this whole thing off faster
[1:04:57] but will he give up his long suffered
[1:05:00] with the Pentecostals and finally they
[1:05:02] said this is it
[1:05:03] God sent a prophet on the scene they
[1:05:05] rejected him well when they rejected the
[1:05:07] Prophet guess what God moved on amen
[1:05:09] what brought back the leaf Pentecostals
[1:05:12] joy rejoicing Pentecost what the fourth
[1:05:15] was the word itself a person the word
[1:05:22] made flesh fruits of the proof of the
[1:05:25] resurrection sign I love those two words
[1:05:28] the resurrection signed that Christ is
[1:05:31] finally listen after justification has
[1:05:35] been planted sanctification has been
[1:05:37] planted baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:40] organizations died out and Christ has
[1:05:43] again centered himself
[1:05:44] like that cap on the pyramid first line
[1:05:47] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:05:51] Holy Ghost
[1:05:52] then the coming of the cap what is it
[1:05:55] the Holy Ghost bunch let's all say it
[1:06:00] together the ones who are awake the Holy
[1:06:02] Ghost bunch the rest of you can think of
[1:06:06] Germans talking gate what is it that
[1:06:08] Holy Ghost bunch being holed out that's
[1:06:11] what's happening now so that it can fit
[1:06:14] with the same kind of ministry he had
[1:06:16] when he went away that when he comes
[1:06:20] back when he comes back it'll catch the
[1:06:26] whole thing in the rapture but now
[1:06:28] bringing him back it's the resurrection
[1:06:31] son so there has to be the resurrection
[1:06:33] before then be that rapture up there
[1:06:36] where the justified sanctified into
[1:06:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid
[1:06:42] will stand again the house of God will
[1:06:45] live again the Tree of Life is growing
[1:06:47] again and then because look when it
[1:06:51] restores it restores that we got we
[1:06:53] don't we don't we don't we got to go
[1:06:55] back the life went down in the roots you
[1:06:59] just see anything but a stump you just
[1:07:00] saw a stump sticking up but when that
[1:07:03] thing's restored it comes back to the
[1:07:04] tree that's what he was saying the pulp
[1:07:07] the bark the leaves the life that's what
[1:07:11] he's talking about The Tree of Life is
[1:07:14] growing again I like that that kind of
[1:07:17] wraps up everything we've been talking
[1:07:18] about for the past past month I just
[1:07:21] found that like you know what I punched
[1:07:22] in I punched in with us the resurrection
[1:07:25] sign because he said resurrection signed
[1:07:28] about 30 times in the in the in his
[1:07:30] sermon but I love that right there the
[1:07:33] tree of life is growing again it's not
[1:07:40] that he's gonna restore people hey the
[1:07:43] the restoration is almost over
[1:07:46] the restoration is almost over it's not
[1:07:48] coming it's almost over a man and I
[1:07:52] please hope we don't miss it
[1:07:58] and that's okay but you know I like that
[1:08:00] song
[1:08:01] but the Israel can't do one thing until
[1:08:05] we get out of here the resurrection sign
[1:08:09] has come to us and you and I are gonna
[1:08:11] have to make that thing manifest not by
[1:08:14] just signs and wonders of of healings of
[1:08:16] cancer and we've seen that in this
[1:08:20] building we've seen the dead come to
[1:08:22] life all those different things we've
[1:08:24] seen that
[1:08:27] but that just speaks of us being in line
[1:08:31] to say Robert Tatum I want to see you
[1:08:35] again
[1:08:36] come through that door that okay so now
[1:08:43] let's get to just about 10 or 15 minutes
[1:08:46] of this last part and we'll speak on it
[1:08:48] next Sunday on the son of man so that's
[1:08:51] what we're going to start them because
[1:08:52] look if the son of man is not here we
[1:08:56] have no resurrection that's why he had
[1:08:59] to come back in the end time as the son
[1:09:02] of man now brother branham being the son
[1:09:05] of man but the son of man ministry
[1:09:08] through brother Branham all right cuz
[1:09:11] he's gonna even tell you I'm gonna read
[1:09:12] a quote here in just a minute where he's
[1:09:14] telling them that they're getting it all
[1:09:15] messed up somewhere Oh an anointed ones
[1:09:18] 1965 said it seems so hard for you hard
[1:09:21] to get them separated and they still do
[1:09:24] because gee people brother Branham was
[1:09:27] not God never will be God never has been
[1:09:32] God but he was used by God in the most
[1:09:37] marvelous way that that I guess if if I
[1:09:40] stood stayed around him for 10 or 15
[1:09:42] years I think he was him because what
[1:09:45] about a human man that could walk up and
[1:09:47] tell you the thoughts you had what you
[1:09:48] did yesterday and what's gonna happen
[1:09:49] tomorrow they say look you're you know
[1:09:53] he just touched people he said you know
[1:09:55] once you your grandpa he he had epilepsy
[1:09:58] in them cuz your son's got epilepsy just
[1:10:00] close your grandpa had epilepsy neither
[1:10:02] grandpa had been dead hundred years that
[1:10:04] was close but it was the sign that we
[1:10:08] supposed to see remember it was not in
[1:10:11] the years of all that that was the
[1:10:13] preparation to get people to turn and
[1:10:16] get their attention right but it was the
[1:10:21] message of the son of man that was
[1:10:24] brought
[1:10:27] Martha said under him I know that he
[1:10:30] shall rise again now now wait a minute
[1:10:32] who's talking here Jesus now Jesus at
[1:10:35] that point right there is the Son of Man
[1:10:39] he's not the son of God distance he's
[1:10:41] the son of man right he was a word made
[1:10:45] flesh standing on the earth in this
[1:10:48] dimension
[1:10:50] okay now we know for a fact that the Son
[1:10:55] of God was working through him you can't
[1:10:59] get away that's the father that's the
[1:11:01] son of God I'll let brother Ram explain
[1:11:03] it you look across out if you want to
[1:11:04] him will let him I'm already too in a
[1:11:06] minute Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:11:09] resurrection and the life he that
[1:11:12] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:11:15] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[1:11:16] believeth in me shall never die believe
[1:11:19] us now this believe us now this cuz you
[1:11:25] know what let me let me just be real
[1:11:31] hard whosoever liveth and believeth in
[1:11:34] me shall never die somebody's gonna make
[1:11:39] that man face
[1:11:41] you know why because jesus said it he
[1:11:45] said it and I can read it I just got to
[1:11:48] start believing it there all right but
[1:11:54] you know who said that the son of man
[1:11:57] I'm trying to the son of man said that
[1:11:59] we know what was the son of God but that
[1:12:02] wasn't a son of God dispensation at that
[1:12:04] time that was the son of man that was in
[1:12:06] the beginning was the word the Word was
[1:12:07] with God we're gonna we gonna read it in
[1:12:09] the minute okay let's go to the next one
[1:12:12] Luke 17 very familiar likewise also as
[1:12:16] it was in the days of lot they did eat
[1:12:18] they drank they bought they sold they
[1:12:20] planted a bill that sounded like today
[1:12:21] but the same day that lot went out of
[1:12:24] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:12:25] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[1:12:27] shall it be in the day not days day when
[1:12:33] the Son of Man is revealed so he can
[1:12:38] walk among you for a long time and then
[1:12:41] be revealed that all right and be
[1:12:44] revealed because he walked for three and
[1:12:47] a half years with the disciples and the
[1:12:48] only time he was ever revealed to them
[1:12:50] was the day of Pentecost and that was
[1:12:54] under the Son of God dispensation amen
[1:12:58] mm-hmm number five proving his word 1964
[1:13:03] brother Brown said now after nineteen
[1:13:05] hundred years with the church ages
[1:13:07] passed he must be talking about us John
[1:13:12] intoxicate yeah you're welcome
[1:13:17] now after nineteen hundred years with a
[1:13:19] church ages passed and all the things
[1:13:21] that he prophesied look he's telling
[1:13:23] he's telling us this thing is wound up
[1:13:26] he prophesied of Luther Wesley and we
[1:13:29] just went through and seen it draw it
[1:13:30] out that was 1964 now sealed robe and
[1:13:33] the moon come down and drawed it out the
[1:13:35] Lord draw it on the board here for us
[1:13:36] remember the church agent I showed it
[1:13:39] and came down himself and confirmed that
[1:13:42] it be right after nineteen hundred years
[1:13:45] and we're at the end of the Laodicean
[1:13:48] Church age he promised in Luke 17 13 Oh
[1:13:52] pay attention he's going to lay
[1:13:54] right here mmm that this same son of man
[1:14:00] there's not - son of man the only one
[1:14:04] that this same son of man he promised it
[1:14:07] would be revealed in the days like it
[1:14:10] was inside him upon the earth did he do
[1:14:12] it does it have to come to pass it's
[1:14:15] impossible now he dot dot dot but I
[1:14:17] believe he was saying it's impossible
[1:14:18] for not to come fast now remember he
[1:14:22] comes in three names the son of man a
[1:14:25] prophet the Son of God the spirit the
[1:14:29] son of David the Millennium that all
[1:14:31] right he came as the Son of Man all
[1:14:35] right died on the cross resurrected
[1:14:38] ascended came back as the Son of God
[1:14:40] through seven Church ages and then he's
[1:14:43] to go to Israel as the son of David in
[1:14:46] the Millennium now
[1:14:50] there's one step missing but he'll bring
[1:14:53] it in right here
[1:14:54] now remember he coming three names son
[1:14:57] of man a prophet son of God the spirit
[1:14:58] son of David for the Millennium but in
[1:15:00] between this conjunction now according
[1:15:03] to his own words in the day when the Son
[1:15:06] of man shall be revealed reveal himself
[1:15:08] as what not son of God son of man will
[1:15:17] reveal his self in a different way
[1:15:22] Martin Luther never saw that way
[1:15:25] Wesley never saw that way Pentecost
[1:15:27] never saw that way and the people that
[1:15:28] said under the message never saw that
[1:15:30] way you and I will see that way we're
[1:15:37] seeing it now he will reveal himself in
[1:15:40] a different way
[1:15:42] not son of God the Son of man we all
[1:15:47] right just a little bit longer let's go
[1:15:51] to Matthew 17 so what way is that this
[1:15:55] is the week this is the different way
[1:15:57] cuz remember who's standing on the
[1:15:59] mountain Thunder man Thunderman standing
[1:16:03] on the mountain alive just got finished
[1:16:05] talking to Moses and Elijah and brother
[1:16:06] Graham today we're talking about what
[1:16:08] his second coming
[1:16:11] aren't we in the second coming hello hey
[1:16:15] man aren't we in the second coming
[1:16:17] so now Jesus has stepped out of that
[1:16:20] vision back into reality everybody with
[1:16:25] me say man I love this I didn't see this
[1:16:28] too the other day as they came down from
[1:16:30] the mountain and then when he lifted up
[1:16:32] their hands they saw no man save Jesus
[1:16:33] only hallelujah they didn't see three
[1:16:36] it's all one and as they came down from
[1:16:39] the mountain Jesus charged him saying
[1:16:42] tell the vision the one he had just been
[1:16:45] in - no man until the Son of Man be
[1:16:49] risen again from the dead now he was
[1:16:53] standing there live
[1:16:55] they were getting ready to kill him
[1:16:57] though cuz they killed the son of man
[1:16:59] you can't kill the son of God son of God
[1:17:01] is spirit God you can't kill the son of
[1:17:03] God but they killed the son of man amen
[1:17:06] they killed that flesh they sure did
[1:17:08] brothers I'm telling you but he's
[1:17:10] prophesying and tell him don't tell this
[1:17:12] vision until the Son of Man be risen
[1:17:14] again from the dead and his disciples
[1:17:18] asked him saying why then say the
[1:17:21] scribes they're going to Malik I'm right
[1:17:26] here they are quoting malachi because
[1:17:28] right now Israel knows that Elijah has
[1:17:31] to come back to us you're in the coming
[1:17:34] of the Lord to them they just don't know
[1:17:38] the one that Elijah gets here he's gonna
[1:17:39] say I'm not the third one or the fourth
[1:17:44] or the fourth one I'm weird the fifth
[1:17:46] Cody you've already missed about three
[1:17:48] or four of these comings right
[1:17:49] you understand the coming of Elijah the
[1:17:51] last coming of Elijah's the two
[1:17:53] witnesses going to Israel and he's going
[1:17:55] to tell them you you missed it and it's
[1:17:58] the sample that asked him saying well
[1:17:59] why didn't say the scribes or Malachi
[1:18:01] they still reading Malcolm what would
[1:18:03] you read mankind for then allies must
[1:18:07] first come because what does the Bible
[1:18:08] say behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:18:12] Prophet before the Great and dreadful
[1:18:13] day of the Lord
[1:18:13] what and he will want turn the heart and
[1:18:15] other children back to the father's and
[1:18:17] the hearts of the father's back to the
[1:18:18] children that's not coming smite the
[1:18:20] earth with a curse they know he's got to
[1:18:21] come back jesus answered and said unto
[1:18:23] them he lies truly shall first come and
[1:18:27] restore restore all things now that's
[1:18:31] not John because John did not restore
[1:18:34] all things he's talking about our man in
[1:18:39] the end time because when those seals
[1:18:41] open that is when they restored all
[1:18:44] things to a group of people but now
[1:18:48] under there under their box
[1:18:55] they thought it was joined abandoned
[1:18:58] because he was at one coming of Elijah
[1:19:02] he was one coming of Elijah to them but
[1:19:05] John the Baptist Lord helped John the
[1:19:08] Baptist restored nothing he introduced
[1:19:11] to restore he was the one that took you
[1:19:14] from the Old Testament and give him to
[1:19:16] the New Testament Ariston you know what
[1:19:21] brother bran remember he said John never
[1:19:23] did one miracle now what is a miracle
[1:19:26] restoration you know if your you got
[1:19:30] cancer and you're dying and somebody
[1:19:32] prays for any chance relief you've been
[1:19:34] restored and then so he said Elijah
[1:19:37] first come and restore all things but I
[1:19:42] say unto you that Elias has come already
[1:19:44] and you knew him not but have done unto
[1:19:48] him whatever's they listed likewise
[1:19:50] shall also the Son of Man suffer of them
[1:19:52] then the disciples understood he spoke
[1:19:54] of them
[1:19:54] he spoke unto them he's not talking to
[1:19:58] me about that Elijah
[1:20:00] he's already spoke to me right here he's
[1:20:04] talking to the disciples understood of
[1:20:08] John's position while Jesus was here but
[1:20:12] he said it last shall truly come and
[1:20:14] restore all things and when he does
[1:20:17] that's coming back because remember we
[1:20:24] read it this morning in first Kings
[1:20:25] where it Elijah restored all the temple
[1:20:28] all the altar and all those things that
[1:20:30] put all the worship back together
[1:20:32] Elijah's message is a message of
[1:20:34] restoration but remember that when
[1:20:37] they're talking about John the Baptist
[1:20:38] he didn't restore anything
[1:20:39] he was an introducer he introduced the
[1:20:43] one to restore all things but brother
[1:20:46] Branham was a little bit different than
[1:20:48] John and you ain't disagree with me you
[1:20:51] might not because remember John the
[1:20:53] Baptist had a position a little
[1:20:55] different than brother Branham brother
[1:20:57] Branham was a church age messenger a
[1:20:58] born-again believer he had the Holy
[1:21:00] Ghost in his soul he was a new born
[1:21:02] again bride of Jesus Christ John was not
[1:21:06] and man John was not all John received
[1:21:09] the holy okay he'd ever seen you birth
[1:21:13] he did not there's no way because the
[1:21:16] least in the kingdom is greater than
[1:21:18] John the kingdom is the baptism of the
[1:21:21] Holy Ghost so if the least and the
[1:21:23] kingdom is greater than john john didn't
[1:21:25] have the kingdom he introduced the
[1:21:28] kingdom he did his work he couldn't go
[1:21:34] and fulfill the next box of elijah
[1:21:36] william branham had to fulfill that box
[1:21:39] because the seals is what restores all
[1:21:42] things you didn't hear what i said a
[1:21:43] minute ago I guess the seals restore all
[1:21:46] things amen
[1:21:48] thereby alright say ma'am hmm alright
[1:21:51] let's read anointing ones at the end ton
[1:21:53] number six paragraph 260 in the very day
[1:21:58] that the Son of Man is revealed
[1:22:00] revelations 10 one two seven read it
[1:22:02] when you get home the seventh angels
[1:22:06] message opening up the seals so that's
[1:22:12] when the Son of Man is to be revealed
[1:22:13] that's what he just said in the very day
[1:22:14] that's the Son of Man is revealed
[1:22:15] revelations 10 1 through 7 Rita when you
[1:22:18] go home this everything just makes it
[1:22:19] open up the self what is it not the
[1:22:22] angel is the Son of Man
[1:22:25] but the messenger is revealing the son
[1:22:29] of man can you get it separated now
[1:22:32] that's where it seems to be so hard for
[1:22:36] you remember he was discerning their
[1:22:38] thoughts and their thoughts were well
[1:22:42] you must be the son of man can you get
[1:22:47] it separated I don't think we have a
[1:22:49] problem with it but just in case
[1:22:50] somebody does that's where it seems to
[1:22:52] be so hard for you see not the son of
[1:22:54] man himself but the seventh angel the
[1:22:57] seventh messenger is revealing to the
[1:23:00] public the Son of Man because it's left
[1:23:03] to shucks he can't organize it it's the
[1:23:06] grain itself again hey alright let's
[1:23:17] read this last one and we'll be finished
[1:23:19] the next Sunday we'll talk about about
[1:23:23] this resurrection and look at some
[1:23:25] resurrections in the Bible because I
[1:23:28] think our problem is when we say
[1:23:29] resurrection there's kind of a
[1:23:32] I don't think we can go there cuz I
[1:23:36] ain't XYZ you know I mean what are you
[1:23:39] putting it on there what you said you
[1:23:42] got a check list do we have a check list
[1:23:44] I know there's certain things we got to
[1:23:46] go through we gotta go through stage
[1:23:47] performance please but well when I quit
[1:23:50] having bad thoughts when when I can get
[1:23:52] up at 7 o'clock instead of 10 when I can
[1:23:55] stop eating so much let's be honest we
[1:24:00] have a list that stops us from doing
[1:24:02] certain things I can't can't couldn't
[1:24:07] and wouldn't never done anything as the
[1:24:12] rising of the Sun that's why I listen
[1:24:14] that's why I told y'all brother branham
[1:24:16] brother branham when he was on that
[1:24:18] bridge he actually in when those seals
[1:24:22] broke he is right now he is reaching
[1:24:24] into the womb of your mind and changing
[1:24:25] your thoughts because all of our
[1:24:28] thoughts have been dead we're going to
[1:24:29] die we got to go to a funeral we got to
[1:24:31] do this we got have this we're all
[1:24:33] getting older am I telling the truth
[1:24:37] we've made a list of all these things
[1:24:40] that we can't do but brother I'm trying
[1:24:42] to get in that womb of your mind and
[1:24:43] turn turn that baby around to where he
[1:24:46] can be born right because remember
[1:24:50] brother
[1:24:51] Dell's always told us the very day that
[1:24:53] we took the change of the body is the
[1:24:54] day we can say we have been truly
[1:24:56] boarding him called this potential now
[1:25:00] you're not born again in this you know
[1:25:02] born again in the spirit realm you're
[1:25:03] boarding it in your soul okay all right
[1:25:07] look let's read this and then we'll then
[1:25:08] we'll I want to read the book of Acts
[1:25:11] and then we'll be done he was waived at
[1:25:13] the day of Pentecost when there came a
[1:25:15] sound from heaven like a waving mighty
[1:25:18] rushing wind and was waved over the
[1:25:20] people the Pentecostal people that was
[1:25:23] up at Pentecost waiting for the
[1:25:24] blessings to come now to be waved again
[1:25:28] when the Son of Man be risen again
[1:25:31] brother Brown was that telling you right
[1:25:33] here where he's getting it from cuz
[1:25:36] remember on the day of Pentecost he
[1:25:37] wasn't waved as the son of man he was
[1:25:40] waved as the son of God the Holy Ghost
[1:25:43] dwelling in the people
[1:25:45] man so the man's word made flesh in the
[1:25:49] end time and to be waved
[1:25:52] again we realize in the last day
[1:25:55] according to Luke 1730
[1:25:57] in the son of son in the Sunday again in
[1:26:01] the day that the Esso n of man will be
[1:26:04] revealed or waved again over the people
[1:26:09] now who is the son of man in the
[1:26:11] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:26:13] God and the Word was God and the Word
[1:26:15] was made flesh and dwelt among us and if
[1:26:18] all the teaching that we have and
[1:26:22] confirmation of the Word of God by the
[1:26:24] Word of God by signs by wonders we see
[1:26:27] today that in the Book of Luke here that
[1:26:31] as we just quoted over to Luke 17
[1:26:33] chapter in the 30th verse and Malachi 4
[1:26:36] in the different scriptures that we are
[1:26:38] all acquainted with that that word again
[1:26:40] is waved over the people when the Son of
[1:26:44] Man be risen again tell tell this vision
[1:26:47] to no one in other words the coming of
[1:26:48] the Son of Man his second coming is the
[1:26:52] coming of the Son of Man see that's
[1:26:55] where even listen that's where even even
[1:26:59] the denominations and that are true and
[1:27:02] right that are trying their best they're
[1:27:04] missing it well I got God in my soul and
[1:27:08] I'm going to die and then one day
[1:27:11] there's a restoration don't a plan yeah
[1:27:13] right if you heard it I met and like
[1:27:15] brother Dale says they always say well
[1:27:16] maybe it's the next generation and that
[1:27:18] generation says well maybe it's the next
[1:27:20] generation why they're afraid to stand
[1:27:22] up they have no clue that the Son of Man
[1:27:24] is here they're missing it just like
[1:27:28] they missed him the first time but
[1:27:30] there's a group of people that's gonna
[1:27:32] catch it ain't gonna be the Word made
[1:27:34] flesh that the word again is waved over
[1:27:38] the people that the dead traditions of
[1:27:41] man is dead something's going to die to
[1:27:44] have a resurrection that the dead
[1:27:47] tradition of man is dead and the Son of
[1:27:50] God is alive again with the baptism of
[1:27:53] the Holy Ghost right among us and it's
[1:27:54] giving us life listen as Christ was the
[1:27:57] first one to
[1:27:59] from all the profits and so forth
[1:28:01] although typed in many places he was the
[1:28:04] first fruits of those that slept in the
[1:28:07] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[1:28:09] church
[1:28:10] they'll have to be a sheaf waved again
[1:28:13] in the last day oh my waving of the
[1:28:17] sheaf what was the sheaf the first one
[1:28:21] that come to mature the first one that
[1:28:24] proved it was a week that proved it was
[1:28:27] a sheaf now many people think brother
[1:28:31] Branham was chiefly if he is he didn't
[1:28:35] come - he didn't prove it hello he'd
[1:28:41] prove it
[1:28:42] he's in the grave sorry you get hurt you
[1:28:47] feeling if you want to but that's
[1:28:48] exactly the truth because now he did
[1:28:51] come to a maturity that no one else come
[1:28:53] to a man but he was waving Jesus Christ
[1:28:57] so that the son of man can do the
[1:29:00] resurrecting William Branham never
[1:29:03] resurrected nobody but his message will
[1:29:07] in a group of people waving of the sheaf
[1:29:13] what was the sheaf the first one that
[1:29:15] come to mature see there's only one
[1:29:16] sheaf and that's Jesus Christ cuz
[1:29:18] remember he went down he resurrected he
[1:29:23] changed his body and he's standing in
[1:29:25] another dimension now there's nobody
[1:29:27] done that
[1:29:32] but there's gonna be somebody because
[1:29:37] he's gonna come back he has to come back
[1:29:39] and made us collectively the son of man
[1:29:45] not one person collectively in the bride
[1:29:49] hallelujah I'm sure that you see what
[1:29:52] I'm talking about
[1:29:53] it was waved over the people you know
[1:29:58] what the wave was it was a sheaf wave
[1:29:59] they took her
[1:30:00] they took the first green ears and they
[1:30:04] put him in a bundle like your arm they
[1:30:07] bound them together and the priest
[1:30:08] walked out into the field in the
[1:30:11] presence of the people and he waved that
[1:30:15] wheat he said this hat in other words
[1:30:18] this is what he said he said this has
[1:30:19] come to maturity and in just a few short
[1:30:23] days this whole field it's going to look
[1:30:27] like this but this is the first one the
[1:30:31] priest would walk out and look at the
[1:30:32] field and they would be a certain group
[1:30:34] that would be Matt or first he would
[1:30:36] take and gather that cut it off and
[1:30:38] gather it and wave it and say ok this is
[1:30:42] proving that this field can come to
[1:30:43] maturity because this group has come to
[1:30:46] maturity Jesus Christ as the only one
[1:30:48] that's come to that maturity
[1:30:49] he's the grain but we are coming back
[1:30:53] but what did he wave over a field of
[1:30:56] dirt did he wave over a field of dirt no
[1:31:00] he waved over the same substance then he
[1:31:02] had in his hand the same substance he
[1:31:06] had in his hand he didn't wave corn and
[1:31:09] it was all week now he waved corn
[1:31:12] because it was corn coming to maturity
[1:31:15] hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm
[1:31:17] talking about
[1:31:18] it was waved over the people and the
[1:31:21] first time there will come forth for the
[1:31:24] bride age for a resurrection gotta have
[1:31:29] a resurrection out of dark
[1:31:30] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:31:35] half the maturity of the word
[1:31:39] what they say Oh fall that the full
[1:31:43] maturity of the word has turned back
[1:31:46] again in its full power being waved over
[1:31:49] the people by the same signs and wonders
[1:31:52] that he did back there because I live
[1:31:54] you live also speaking to his wife
[1:31:58] because I live you live also what a
[1:32:01] resurrection that that was and what a
[1:32:03] resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:32:06] from the dead see brother Branham was
[1:32:08] standing there though knowing there was
[1:32:10] a group of people that had a even in his
[1:32:12] ministry had been quickened but he
[1:32:16] wasn't talking about the whole field the
[1:32:18] whole field hadn't even been planted yet
[1:32:22] most of us weren't even well I was but a
[1:32:25] lot of y'all wasn't even alive when this
[1:32:26] was pre physically and some of you were
[1:32:30] alive he was probably dead and doing
[1:32:31] something else hello
[1:32:33] 95 Bush right okay hey I don't may he
[1:32:36] don't mind he's walking around with a
[1:32:38] dead man walking dead man walking that's
[1:32:41] what we were dead man walking but you
[1:32:44] know what I saw
[1:32:45] if the old me dies God can quicken it I
[1:32:51] love what Dwight Moody said and I'll
[1:32:53] tell you again what moody said God will
[1:32:55] fill those who are not fool ourselves
[1:32:57] right now because I live you live also
[1:33:00] what a resurrection that that was and
[1:33:01] what a resurrection this is to be
[1:33:04] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[1:33:06] in Christ Jesus by God's quickening
[1:33:10] power he was waved to them the word
[1:33:13] which he was was waved back to them on
[1:33:17] the day of Pentecost the word made
[1:33:19] manifest now and as I say is to be waved
[1:33:21] again
[1:33:24] in the last day right now today one
[1:33:33] scripture noon we close right here
[1:33:36] ax 1 when they therefore will come
[1:33:42] together they ask of them saying Lord we
[1:33:45] don't have a clue what's going on we
[1:33:48] have missed everything you've said for
[1:33:50] three and a half years because they
[1:33:52] would have never asked that question if
[1:33:54] they would have known what he was doing
[1:33:56] I mean this guy had already raised from
[1:33:59] the dead walked around them for thirty
[1:34:01] to forty days
[1:34:02] alive and they asked this silly question
[1:34:06] if he had the Holy Ghost they didn't
[1:34:08] that question got answered ten days
[1:34:12] later when they asked the Lord was out
[1:34:17] at this time restore again he's getting
[1:34:19] ready to disappear he's getting ready to
[1:34:22] disappear he said Lord well thou at this
[1:34:27] time restore again the Kingdom of Israel
[1:34:30] he said if it's not for you to know the
[1:34:32] time of the season which the father had
[1:34:34] put in his own power but ye shall
[1:34:36] receive power ten days later after that
[1:34:40] the Holy Ghost is come upon you you
[1:34:42] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[1:34:44] Jerusalem and all of Judea Samaria into
[1:34:46] the other most parts of the earth
[1:34:47] now who was he talking to he was talking
[1:34:50] to them it's coming back as the son of
[1:34:51] God right on the day of Pentecost spirit
[1:34:57] God but watch what he said I mean watch
[1:35:00] what the Angels cuz it took a messenger
[1:35:01] to tell us what was going on and when he
[1:35:04] had spoken these things while they
[1:35:05] beheld he was taken up and a cloud
[1:35:08] received him out of their side and I'm
[1:35:14] sure some of them were just kind of
[1:35:16] what just happened we're supposed to
[1:35:22] receive power and we can't even see him
[1:35:24] now and while they look steadfast toward
[1:35:27] heaven behold two men stood by them in
[1:35:32] white apparel which also said Ye men of
[1:35:36] Galilee why stand ye gazing up into the
[1:35:40] heaven well in other words well what are
[1:35:44] you doing this same jesus now who
[1:35:52] ascended it son a daughter son of man
