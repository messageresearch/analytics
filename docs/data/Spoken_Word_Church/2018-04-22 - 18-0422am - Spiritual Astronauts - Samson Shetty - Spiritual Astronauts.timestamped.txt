[1:06:55] astronauts praise the Lord I am asking
[1:06:59] the Lord to help me to give me words
[1:07:01] give me because I have learned my most
[1:07:04] of Milan English I have learned from
[1:07:05] relatives message I don't know I don't
[1:07:08] know because I have never spray I've
[1:07:10] never I'm not used to preach in this
[1:07:12] language but since nine years you know
[1:07:15] when I came first time I was told you
[1:07:17] know George and but learning process
[1:07:19] learning process learning you know we
[1:07:22] are learning praise the Lord and the
[1:07:24] Bible says there that way wait upon the
[1:07:26] Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:07:28] shall mount up with wings as Eagles they
[1:07:34] shall run and not be weary and they
[1:07:37] shall walk and not faint Isaiah chapter
[1:07:40] 40 and verse 31 and here brother Branham
[1:07:43] said like this in the countdown message
[1:07:46] 1962 I believe I think it is in 1962
[1:07:51] September 9 he said like this in 27
[1:07:54] paragraph Hebrews says here we read the
[1:07:58] scriptures from Hebrews chapter 11 he
[1:08:00] said Hebrews says here was made of
[1:08:03] things which do not appear other words
[1:08:06] they are supernatural praise the Lord
[1:08:10] and the supernatural is reflecting the
[1:08:13] natural see now then then the natural
[1:08:17] was eternal or it is to be everlasting
[1:08:20] with supernatural but sin perverted the
[1:08:25] natural so if that is so which I believe
[1:08:29] it is then everything is happening on
[1:08:31] earth is a type of
[1:08:33] spiritual things that's happening see
[1:08:37] it's God to reflect something that
[1:08:40] achievement of man praise the Lord and
[1:08:43] he was telling about the natural things
[1:08:45] and supernatural things and how this
[1:08:48] natural body you know when women give
[1:08:51] birth to the to a baby first thing what
[1:08:54] is it it comes a water then after
[1:08:56] blurred then after life same way the
[1:08:59] super in a spiritual way to in the
[1:09:02] spiritual in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:09:03] when we born again when we get into the
[1:09:06] body of Christ we have to get into the
[1:09:08] you know justification sanctification
[1:09:09] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:09:12] so he was telling all these things and
[1:09:15] you know natural things reflecting the
[1:09:18] spiritual things amen and amen all
[1:09:22] things spiritual all happening and so
[1:09:25] forth pact or type the supernatural and
[1:09:29] the natural is a type of the
[1:09:31] supernatural praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:09:34] praise the name of the Lord so my
[1:09:37] brothers and sister this morning I would
[1:09:39] like to read some course here here
[1:09:43] program said but my point is this
[1:09:47] whatever the message we have got it is
[1:09:50] from the Word of God from the message of
[1:09:52] the hour from the prophet of God not
[1:09:53] from our own thinking not from Bible
[1:09:56] College or seminary or not from any
[1:09:58] university you know even I was thinking
[1:10:00] about a man of God you know a man of God

[1:14:01] what the church will look like at the
[1:14:03] time the advanced achievements of the

[1:14:31] shirts big big cash shirts and then
[1:14:34] after the natural little cash shirts see
[1:14:37] how the technology is growing as as the
[1:14:41] technology is growing in the same
[1:14:44] spiritual rhythm in a spiritual way in
[1:14:47] the spiritual lines we have to see we
[1:14:49] have to compare the Church of God the
[1:14:52] bride of Jesus Christ is getting
[1:14:55] step-by-step up higher getting up from
[1:14:59] justification to sanctification
[1:15:01] scientific a Shinto the baptism of the

[1:15:30] the button it went what is that
[1:15:37] traveling like a thought it's a it's a
[1:15:42] reflecting something we used to travel
[1:15:46] when William Carey when he came to India
[1:15:50] he used to travel he had traveled for
[1:15:53] months from British from England to
[1:15:57] India for months in the ship but now I
[1:16:00] can travel about 14 hours from Abu Dhabi
[1:16:03] Dubai to Chicago only 14 hours or 13 14
[1:16:07] hours and from there you know another
[1:16:09] three hours from there another three
[1:16:11] hours almost 24 hours with layers
[1:16:13] including all this but you know what it
[1:16:16] even not in even 24 hours I'm coming
[1:16:20] from this India which is other side of
[1:16:23] the globe ten thousand miles from from
[1:16:27] other side of the globe I'm traveling

[1:17:29] hours to get here but your Todd is
[1:17:31] traveling not even in a fraction of
[1:17:33] seconds that means what ellebra have
[1:17:37] said in other side we will be traveling

[1:18:17] see the achievements that God has made
[1:18:20] how happenings always in this earth are
[1:18:24] representing something that comes from
[1:18:26] somewhere else but when it strikes the
[1:18:30] earth it's usually is in a perverted
[1:18:34] condition because it is in the world of
[1:18:38] darkness and sin right but then there is
[1:18:44] a true reverent representation in the
[1:18:48] spiritual religious of the other
[1:18:51] dimension the invented Facebook the
[1:18:54] invented Google they have invented all
[1:18:56] the internet and when when you just you
[1:18:58] just want to send a message sent it went

[1:20:23] Lord hallelujah and here brother Branham
[1:20:25] in 1944 photograph you know he said now
[1:20:30] notice now if years a few years ago the
[1:20:33] transportation was by horse and buggy
[1:20:36] not to for long not to fall echo long
[1:20:41] ago I done by driving around in a horse
[1:20:45] and buggy and on his saddle he is is is
[1:20:49] preaching on the transportation now how
[1:20:53] the technology is developing from you
[1:20:56] know the transportation they used to
[1:20:57] have we have more carts ox carts I used
[1:21:01] to travel in an ox course to the jungles
[1:21:03] because the roads are very rough you
[1:21:06] know stony and rocky and and dirt and
[1:21:09] you know you know you know it's a rough
[1:21:12] roads but the the wheels to the Ox
[1:21:16] scores are strong and the the people
[1:21:21] there used to carry us and we still have
[1:21:23] that we still have below course we still
[1:21:25] have hawks courts because people in the
[1:21:28] tribal areas in jungles in the in the
[1:21:30] remote places in the in a different
[1:21:32] areas they don't have nothing to travel
[1:21:35] they don't my automobile they don't know
[1:21:36] Mike bike or anything you know just
[1:21:39] there some people walk
[1:21:41] I was telling to a brother yesterday
[1:21:43] they used to walk 100 miles to in in the
[1:21:46] olden days hundred miles hundred
[1:21:51] kilometers 50 kilometers in olden days
[1:21:54] in in a we're back like a hundred years
[1:21:57] back something like that because they go
[1:22:00] and they walk for 10 20 kilometers and
[1:22:03] they go and sit somewhere and eat and
[1:22:05] they take rest under the tree or
[1:22:06] somewhere and then they will walk again
[1:22:08] to reach to their villages to to their
[1:22:11] cities that was the condition in the
[1:22:15] time that was the situation see so here
[1:22:18] a brother branham said now it pass a
[1:22:20] souped-up car what a difference the
[1:22:24] horse-and-buggy day then the automobile
[1:22:27] day and then the airplane day come along
[1:22:31] praise the Lord hallelujah now the
[1:22:34] horse-and-buggy days was who is just if
[1:22:39] not so if there is no prophet of God to
[1:22:42] this generation what would be you know
[1:22:45] how what what is going to our our
[1:22:48] condition where we will be you know see
[1:22:51] God's prophet is comparing their natural
[1:22:55] transportation to the spiritual
[1:22:57] transportation because we all are
[1:22:59] foreigners and pilgrims and strangers in
[1:23:03] this world Enoch walked with God a
[1:23:07] traveler a traveler a traveler and here
[1:23:11] the prophet of God is showing about the
[1:23:14] transportation about the traveling
[1:23:16] traveling from horse and buggy to car
[1:23:19] automobile from car to up in air
[1:23:22] airplane you know praise the Lord and
[1:23:24] he's comparing is typing that hey man
[1:23:26] praise the Lord the horse and buggy days
[1:23:29] was whoo that was the ending of the
[1:23:32] Lutheran age see horse and buggy race
[1:23:36] they believed in justification God
[1:23:39] bringing the church from Romanism
[1:23:41] Catholicism Catholicism he brought it
[1:23:44] into the first spiritual achievement
[1:23:47] that the just shall live by faith that
[1:23:53] was the horse and buggy days
[1:23:55] they come from to the horse-and-buggy
[1:23:58] days that ended now the next achievement
[1:24:01] man had in the way of transportation was
[1:24:04] the automobile automobile and you notice
[1:24:10] the automobile increase all the time in
[1:24:12] its power
[1:24:14] we were talking iron brother Joseph Joe
[1:24:16] Joe yesterday talking you know about you
[1:24:19] know everything if it is a horse buggy
[1:24:21] horsepower if it is automobile you know
[1:24:25] a car something it's this also they call
[1:24:28] horsepower a t-mobile key for this and
[1:24:32] that brother I'm talking the 1315
[1:24:34] horsepower is saying that see the
[1:24:37] horsepower if it is aircraft horsepower
[1:24:39] say everything horsepower horse horse
[1:24:43] horse horse is a strength it's a power
[1:24:46] amen powerful animal to pull though the
[1:24:50] weights and Lords and wagons and stuff
[1:24:53] like that you know
[1:24:54] so carries the Lord's amen so the same
[1:24:57] way amen and we are just you know having
[1:25:02] see the Elijah when he was looking unto
[1:25:06] the Lord to go into that that up into
[1:25:08] the heavenlies to cut up into the
[1:25:11] whirlwind he was just just following the
[1:25:13] leadership of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:25:15] Lord God sent him a chariot of fire a
[1:25:19] fire of horse horsepower glory
[1:25:29] excuse me now at the end of the Wesley
[1:25:32] age brought it in by spiritual
[1:25:36] achievement sanctification which means
[1:25:38] the church raised from the justified
[1:25:41] state to a sanctified justified by faith
[1:25:46] faith into the sanctification state
[1:25:50] hallelujah praise the Lord one after one
[1:25:53] that means the church is going up higher
[1:25:57] stepping you know step by step one after
[1:26:01] one one after one you know God wants us
[1:26:04] to come up not going down
[1:26:07] hallelujah praise the Lord I'm not
[1:26:10] talking about the you know being humble
[1:26:13] and humility that's good
[1:26:15] you know we got to be humble and be
[1:26:17] humility in the presence of God that is
[1:26:19] another thing but he wants us to come up
[1:26:22] higher in a spiritual reeling in the
[1:26:26] world in the power of Jesus Christ in
[1:26:29] the baptism of the Holy Spirit in the
[1:26:32] revelation of the world in the
[1:26:33] revelation of the message of the our aim
[1:26:36] and in the fellowship in prayer praise
[1:26:39] God hallelujah amen I believe that now
[1:26:43] we notice again along came the
[1:26:45] Methodists with sanctification he was
[1:26:48] talking about you know the Martin Luther
[1:26:51] and from John Wesley see sanctification
[1:26:55] there was many of those Methodists was
[1:26:58] actually sanctified now there's a lot of
[1:27:01] them claimed it that know nothing about
[1:27:03] it yes that's that's what we see in that
[1:27:06] these denominations the Methodist Church
[1:27:07] taught sanctification they said they got
[1:27:10] down and cried and got back up said
[1:27:13] glory to God I'm sanctified that's what
[1:27:17] they learned and they're still there in
[1:27:20] that condition but they have to come up
[1:27:23] higher from Methodist from Baptist from
[1:27:27] PES material from Pentecostals amen and
[1:27:31] there went right on living like that and
[1:27:34] always did but some of those men and
[1:27:37] women was actually sanctified from the
[1:27:40] things of the world and lived a
[1:27:43] consecrated set aside life why that was
[1:27:49] the automobile age which took in more
[1:27:53] horsepower automobile praise the Lord
[1:27:57] when science achieved something by the
[1:27:59] natural God is achieving something by
[1:28:03] spiritual see something is going on all
[1:28:06] the time not only is talking about
[1:28:09] automobile age not only Wright brothers
[1:28:11] not only John you know all these things
[1:28:13] know all the time that means this time
[1:28:17] to when they are inventing all this
[1:28:19] I don't know I have never dreamed about
[1:28:21] this video calling and on whatsapp I was
[1:28:24] in Australia last year whether Gary
[1:28:26] Walker wants me to come so I you know
[1:28:29] they they invited us and I preached
[1:28:31] there you know because they wanted to
[1:28:33] know what's happening in the country of
[1:28:35] India because we you know when we had a
[1:28:37] meetings with brother Gary Walker last
[1:28:39] year the Hindus Kim of course you all
[1:28:42] know the story they cancelled our
[1:28:45] services and they told him to leave the
[1:28:48] country and human sister Deborah left
[1:28:50] you know so they wanted to know and
[1:28:52] they're the people wants to hear from me
[1:28:54] so they they paid for everything and
[1:28:56] they they asked to me to come I invited
[1:28:59] so I went there so my brothers and
[1:29:02] sisters so when I went there in
[1:29:06] Australia why I'm speaking this I don't
[1:29:09] know so when science achieved something
[1:29:12] by natural God is at achieving something
[1:29:15] in my spiritual see something is growing
[1:29:18] all time yeah this is what I'm trying to
[1:29:20] say you have to come back rewind you
[1:29:24] know so that's what in spiritual I'm
[1:29:28] initial so we lift the word where we
[1:29:31] have we have lived the word Miliband's
[1:29:33] are not going further come back to the
[1:29:36] word again come back to the word so he
[1:29:40] preached that to come back so then when
[1:29:42] we come something something when we lost
[1:29:44] something we have to in India what I do
[1:29:48] I go to the place where I lost something
[1:29:51] not I'm finding something over there but
[1:29:54] my mind's go there when I go to that
[1:29:56] place and and it comes to some of them
[1:30:01] you got that experience I don't know but
[1:30:02] I got that experience say SE c-- and and
[1:30:07] and and i went to so I want to call my
[1:30:10] life I want to talk to my daughter's I

[1:30:21] that all the scratches on the phone I
[1:30:22] don't know how to use it but I use I'm
[1:30:25] learning so when I had an accident I
[1:30:27] dropped it and got scratches and

[1:30:53] him see how the science advanced
[1:30:57] technology say praise the Lord
[1:31:01] so everything when the science is
[1:31:05] developing it is reflecting something
[1:31:08] the spiritual brother branham said when
[1:31:11] elijah was on mount carmel there was a
[1:31:14] television is that right he said that
[1:31:17] there was a television there was a radio
[1:31:20] i didn't understand when i read that but
[1:31:23] after i started listening to the
[1:31:25] messages i understand he got the visions
[1:31:28] that everything is caught up in the air
[1:31:30] which you can't see with the natural you
[1:31:33] know the science the technology the
[1:31:34] fourth dimension is that right the
[1:31:37] technology is the fourth dimension and
[1:31:39] 50 dimension is the hell and 60
[1:31:41] dimension is the 60 dimension is the
[1:31:43] paradise and 70 dimension is the
[1:31:45] heavenly places Amen praise the Lord
[1:31:49] I want to watch the time - hey man
[1:31:52] because I'm not in in my in my hindi
[1:31:54] yeah you know so so my brother says this
[1:31:57] is a sanctification the second step of
[1:31:59] grace amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:32:02] see what man achieves on earth for
[1:32:05] they're men of things which do appear
[1:32:07] God was able to achieve something by a
[1:32:11] spirit-filled people who were hungering
[1:32:14] and thirsting and those that would stay
[1:32:18] with the world
[1:32:21] wait the word a man blessed be the name
[1:32:27] of the Lord thank you Jesus thank you
[1:32:29] Lord so we just come this church is
[1:32:33] coming up higher from horse and buggy to
[1:32:36] automobile and from automobile age from
[1:32:40] from from from the from the ground from
[1:32:44] Earth
[1:32:45] lifting up hallelujah and they thought
[1:32:50] that that is it that is great see here
[1:32:54] Wesley was one of the great scientists
[1:32:57] Luther was one of the great scientists
[1:33:00] and he took God's command he said like
[1:33:03] this there didn't care what the churches
[1:33:06] said what the organization said Luther
[1:33:09] didn't care what the Catholics said he
[1:33:13] believed the just shall live by faith
[1:33:16] hallelujah faith is a revelation faith
[1:33:20] is a super sense faith is looking unto
[1:33:23] unseen praise God hallelujah
[1:33:26] and he took God's chemicals of the world
[1:33:28] and put it together and the church moved
[1:33:30] by faith moved hallelujah just moving
[1:33:34] forward moving forward hallelujah and
[1:33:37] put it together and a church moved by
[1:33:39] faith Wesley put it together by the
[1:33:41] blood and he proved it by the blood and
[1:33:43] the church called sanctified the
[1:33:46] Pentecostal believed the same Baptist or
[1:33:49] the Holy Ghost their promises to you and
[1:33:51] your children and them that far off they
[1:33:54] put all the chemicals together out of
[1:33:56] the word and they moved into the air
[1:34:00] hallelujah
[1:34:01] they moved out because they were able to
[1:34:03] accomplish such so one after one from
[1:34:07] horse and a buggy from automobile and
[1:34:09] then airplane the Wright brothers came
[1:34:12] in at the same the end of the age the
[1:34:15] Pentecostal people the Pentecostal
[1:34:18] adduce a street revival started and the
[1:34:21] people got the power from horn hi mind
[1:34:24] map so the Holy Ghost fell upon the
[1:34:25] people and they started speaking in
[1:34:27] tongues and dancing in the spirit and
[1:34:29] shouting screaming jumping and all these
[1:34:31] things you know they thought that is it
[1:34:33] and the people when I was listening to
[1:34:37] this message last night
[1:34:38] Briella Braddock was preaching very you
[1:34:41] know the power of God the presence of
[1:34:43] God was so powerful and he was so it's a
[1:34:45] evangelistic message he said and he was
[1:34:47] preaching and preaching other people are
[1:34:49] screaming shouting hallelujah when they
[1:34:51] when he said about airplane and
[1:34:53] Pentecostal everybody said hallelujah
[1:34:55] hey man
[1:34:55] amen amen and they thought that oh we
[1:35:00] are so great and we came up that's good
[1:35:03] okay but that is not it
[1:35:06] there is something else beyond the
[1:35:10] Pentecostal age beyond the Pentecostal
[1:35:12] relief beyond the Pentecostal you know
[1:35:15] the experience there is something else
[1:35:17] what is that he said astronauts
[1:35:20] astronauts Clara did you notice one of
[1:35:25] these scientific achievements of camp I
[1:35:27] campaigned the other one complemented
[1:35:30] the other one and it was only in higher
[1:35:33] form say the automobile was hired from
[1:35:37] of transportation then the horse and the
[1:35:41] airplane was hired from a form of
[1:35:44] transportation than automobile but they
[1:35:48] are campaigned one another horsepower
[1:35:51] amen if that's horsepower
[1:35:55] what about God's power if that is God's
[1:35:59] if it is if that was horsepower whatever
[1:36:03] God's power whatever the Holy Ghost
[1:36:05] power the Holy Ghost power that can
[1:36:08] justify you the same Holy Ghost power
[1:36:10] can sanctify you the same Holy Ghost
[1:36:12] power that sanctifies you can fill you
[1:36:15] with his presence sitting in heavenly
[1:36:21] places in Christ to Jesus glory to God
[1:36:24] and little size that they didn't know
[1:36:27] their ABCs founded why there were
[1:36:30] spiritual scientists amen they see in
[1:36:33] the thing they believed it mandated by
[1:36:35] education the natural scientist the
[1:36:38] spiritual scientist done it by
[1:36:40] revelation only by revelation worn by
[1:36:47] education the other by revelation oh if
[1:36:51] we can just open up there's all kinds of
[1:36:54] material laying here that's right
