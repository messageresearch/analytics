and then we will go to hebrews 1. revelations 1 and hebrews 1. i know terence has already announced it but most of you we're downstairs remember my niece that we've been praying for for cancer um they called all the family in today but just pray because it's a blood problem and they've had to cancel the blood down so low until i guess it's doing but remember jane and just keep her in your prayers remember also now the lord willing this coming wednesday brother collins will be here preaching for you and if he's not brother ray has to take over because that's what you call close buddy society and we've already arranged it so don't worry about it we've already arranged to have him a little platform put up here where you'll be able to see him but now the lord and brother collins will be here and the lord willing brother forney will be here for the weekend so remember wade and donnie myself be leaving tomorrow at lunch time heading to texas and pray that the lord would be with us and we'll be back as quick as we can so that's the main thing all right any other announcements i generally forget them terrex has announced the uh the the food so if you switch places real quick remember you know which one you're supposed to bring all right one on one side supposed to bring rolls the other side's supposed to bring sweets so now if you you don't want to bring roads you're going to switch seats real quick all right back up and forth or whatever but uh we're looking forward to a good time there on the when it's 19th right and remember to now the uh we're gonna the watch night service um we'll be starting at eight o'clock and uh i've asked you to bring your questions comments thoughts etc on the godhead because that's what we're going to be trying to uh speak about and do you know and maybe cover an overall view so that'll give us four hours that we can take our time all right so remember that be much in prayer any other announcements i generally forget something but just remember that let's pray the heavenly father we thank you for the day and the time that we have we thank you for your love and your guidance unto us and we pray that you would just lord be with us today we know that there are many sick among us but yet we read in your word where you said that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so lord remember these and father just bless each one and lord we ask that you would just come among us today to be the not the onlooker to record but be the preeminent one to speak through our hearts and lives and to one another that we may see you and lord we thank you for your love and your grace unto us and the day that we out the hour that we're living the word we've heard we thank you for all thanks enough lord just come now and bless and be with the family there my sister and them in the time that jane is there in the hospital so just you just reach down and touch her lord and deliver from that because lord she needs your help we love you and we thank you and jesus is your name amen uh revelations one we've been reading this and then we'll go to hebrews 1. the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now i wrote in my bible a long time ago the time to understand you know all right hebrews one verse 13 and 14. but to which are the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make nine enemies thy footstool now he's going to tell you what angels are all right are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we took a couple of services i had to that's just an extra edition and some of them blank on the back so i just had to jump up and run them in and and uh when i do that sometimes it you know gets everything to go and we've got some new copiers coming to the house and i'm planning on getting some one of these uh uh coffee machines and put it to the house one of these days and i can do it at home and i don't have to come here and and try to run things off but my problem is is i run something off and i think of something else and i run it in and i run something run that off and think of something else and you know i'm so thrilled for the computer system that we can you know be able to handle those things and pull up quotes in a hurry all right but now we've been talking about and we spoke a couple of services and labeled it you know the words of this prophecy but put a subtitle to it or talking about uh angels or his angels his angel or his angels and uh i just want to speak today on that line because i want to make sure that we understand you know and we'll read in a little bit what brother branham had to say about the way people kind of believe and sometimes i wonder if that's our way of believing that uh you know we just say well it's just the holy spirit well you know you say well i'm not concerned about all these other things well it may be because you're not concerned about being visited by angels and uh you know that may be the concern of it you know so i want us to just kind of think about it you know we're real quick to use like brother branham as an angel and there are early angels and they're heavenly angels all right and then you've got the holy spirit which is an angel and then you've got christ that you can cover as an angel you've got a lot of things to be doing so we're going to just title this message um words of this prophecy number six but just put angelic beings angelic beings because that's what we want to talk about in other words try to take an overall view and and look at it as to what maybe that would help us and uh you know i told you that this is not an argumentative thing uh about whether or not it was brother random that came to john on patmos because that's what a lot of people believes and that's all right that's what you believe that's all right you know i'm not gonna argue with you about it uh i'm just gonna you know try to do what i can to preach the gospel but still ill regardless now if that was brother branham or he is brother branham or shall be brother branham or whatever they you know there's different versions of what that will be john was translated over into this and saw this or her brother random come to john this happened and everything i'm not as concerned about that as i am to try to be concerned about um when the boy says he has a copy machine in the store i have if it's a small one we'd do all right we got one years ago but it never did work work nothing but you know so but now my point is this it's not being concerned about who come to john my concern is who come to brother brown amen because it's not promised then as a way of brother branham coming to john as people want to believe he's going to do or has done or whatever you know uh it's i'm not concerned about that happening to me and you see he did come to our day in the times and we have the books the tapes et cetera fine you know but i believe the same one that come to brother branham must come to you and me all right now that won't make us prophets as brother branham that will make us whatever god has in need of whether it be for you sisters to teach your children to teach whatever the younger whatever whether it be the house cleaner to clean up the church the you know the the uh tape recorder uh recording situations the internet the things the trustees the the deacons etc or whether it be the ministers that minister unto us the the main thing is i want to do is to make sure that we can hold that to see the truth of the hour that we're living in the basis of who's going to come to me and you and god uses people we believe in that that you'll see me keep emphasizing that that in in the word angel can mean messenger all right now and see and just being a minister i'm a messenger with a message to be brought to you think all right then you will become the angelic beings who take this message and and carry it out to others see it's god's way of doing things and if you don't you don't get nothing out of the message now get this point no matter what you call angelic beings now we're talking about true ones not the ones that failed now brother random um questions and answers on genesis he covers that how those fallen angels can come down and inhabit us now not as josephus and them thought it come down and press themselves into human flesh that way no but as to come down and can give you and me of nature you know so we got to deal with that you know we had that those fallen angels gave us the nature whether we wanted or not you know and everybody has a different nature about it we're not all natured the same it's not it's not that awake we're we're different people you know but we've got to deal with trying to overcome but the main point i want to see is those angels that didn't fall now those angels that didn't fall the prophet says can come down and lead you and i and guide us those are the ones that i'm concerned about the others i'm not uh i'm not concerned but i want to get rid of them don't you you know i want a nature change and that's what we all should want and i believe even though you you get born again you still have problems with yourself but the statue of a perfect man should take away a lot of the problems or at least a while in this message you want to take away some problems you know you don't uh uh like richard and i were talking while we were doing hunting and i i just told him i said now richard if i've got to tell you your troubles you got troubles brother anderson if i've got to tell you you're troubled you know what you got trouble because you're not seeing your own sales right now i mean that's the way we are to look at anything that's right we see ourselves and then we work on ourselves but you know what we see we see other people and we want to work on other people you know my angel needs to go over the weight and help him out you know you know i'm going to have to apologize to mine when i get there i've always told you that i kind of believe that god probably had to give me two of them and you say well that's funny no it's not funny because i do believe in that and we'll get to it in a minute but now the i'm concerned about who come to brother branham right because the one that come to brother brown by way of him speaking it then thereby can come to you and me and that that's why i believe the message like i do all right but now brother branham i gave it to you page 13 of the church age book i put these on a lot of them because that way they're going on the internet system and and you know and people can read them that one from kenya today uh thanking us for the the stand we make on the message and and things like that we're just one word you know like that helps me because we realize somebody out there heard and maybe they want to follow some more yeah but brother ran them on page 13 in the church age book he said that this was the only book in the bible whereby jesus coming to a scribe you know huh he comes to the scribe to write the word okay appear in there all right now we covered that we covered one point to me that is very valuable even though an angel a prophet even though the lord jesus christ appeared to people that didn't reveal a thing to him while he was here on earth he couldn't reveal anything he said well what do i mean you just take away all of our head knowledge no i'm not taking away no his knowledge you gotta have head knowledge you don't have head down this you don't have heart knowledge but my point is just like brother brown says and i i've quoted these so i thought well i'll put them on to make sure right around and said it on page two on your notes sir uh page 38 christ mr god revealed that jesus said my own life did not reveal that unto you peter then he goes down to page 47 of the christmas mystery he said the holy ghost is the only revealer of the word huh now he's the only revealer is no man can reveal anything to you well brother adam revealed this the man i told you before separated from me because i said i believe i had a revelation and he said i don't have no revelation my revelation brought around got a revelation well i just couldn't understand that language because i said i had a revelation he said he had a revelation he just said his revelation was that he didn't have no revelation well that's still a revelation so it didn't convince me of anything it was just you know and i put mine and you know where the quotes are at so you know i don't try to tell you just what i think if i do i'll be glad to tell you this is what i find no problem all right now but even if brother branham could speak to you personally we were talking last night about some things and and i encourage you to to uh tell me about your your lives and your things and your testimonies and and we've never really as long as i've been around joyce i've never heard her say what she said last night and i thoroughly enjoyed it and she said i sat and saw the prophet i saw the things that happened said even as a a child a teenager young child coming up she said i love to be in that presence and we go for three or four meetings or something a weekend and said i didn't want to go home but see that was just a child because there was such a presence and and things there that would be you know but then she said one day the lord spoke to her see that's worth it all right see it's worth it all right but that way it settles immediately i told her i said yep peter said i have a more sure word of prophecy even though he was dire with the lord jesus walked with him for three and a half years got to go up on the mount he was chosen basically every time to go with the lord as to whatever to do because peter james and john faith hope charity or how you love or whatever it did he was chosen to go but he said i have a more sure word of prophecy he had a new birth that's what we need is the new birth because the new birth is the only revealer in the world if we don't have the holy ghost see then then that's the problem all right but now even though the angel could come to john now we're back over in chapter one now not over in chapter 22. we ain't know whether yet so just don't go over there and run over that away so far just stay with me we read here in our scriptures in revelations 1 that god give a revelation to an angel he gave it to jesus to give to an angel all right then that angel reveals the whole book to john so now this angel here in chapter one now that i'm quoting brother random i've got to quote flynn on the desk that did where that angel revealed the entire book now if we don't get that in order of the right way then we will have the wrong time but remember chapter one my point all right everybody got the point of making even though that angel was assigned a specific thing to do to come to john to tell him yet still that angel had to step backward because when he's doing it the lord jesus steps on the scene if any angel or ever who it is comes to you remember galatians 1 8 faces the angel because it says in galatians 1 8 that if an angel come from heaven and run around emphasizes not just an earthly thing but some great big thing happened some angel out of heaven come to you said if you see anything contrary to the word leave it alone because i didn't send him all right see this angel that come to john here to reveal it to john is there any difference in that angel that come in revelations 1 or the one that you would speak of later on throughout the bible or later on until you come to the um chapter 22 who brought around you said the angel come all right but now we found out that jesus stepped on the scene to vindicate what this angel was saying he didn't just stay back that's why i loved god so much when brother around made that statement one time and i love to say it he said even though god knew we sinned and what was going to take place he said he didn't stay up in heaven said he come down to live with us on earth now i love that because you know we're involved you see even though that angel would come to bring the message the emphasis is laid up on jesus coming all right now i know the quote when we get over there 22 don't worry about it i'm got them lined up you know i know brother brown said they said brother was that jesus that come to john he said no he said he's one of the prophets i know that see but here in chapter one jesus comes on the scene now i don't believe he came to john on patmos as jesus standing there in a corporal 16 element body you may believe that i don't think you'd be any problems either way whatever you want to believe but i just personally don't believe that i believe he came to him then as to show him something that we spoke of wednesday night all right now in doing that when it comes down to what you see in chapter one brother said that was not a prophet we brought that out wednesday he said that was god that come to john in chapter one because it's revealed as the alpha and amiga i want you to know who i am brother around said before we go any further he said red letter that he's speaking in the entire writings of chapter two and three which is about the seven church ages he's in red letter which means that jesus is speaking so he's personally coming to john now he said well now that this gets confusing you got angels and you got jesus and you got that how would you like a quote where brother brown said when i got into senior notes where he said now there's a difference in the holy spirit in that angel he said the holy spirit is real sweet he said but there's just an aw when an angel comes now is he making greater than jesus come on then i ask you the question why was it around him with that angel all his life why did that angel not tell him about the seal right until never said now that's right that's what we want to deal with when we get there all right see there was an angel to each church age right amen until the angel of the church of ephesus under the anger but those were what now men right now as we'll get to it in a second then each one of those men that were messengers et cetera you know people paul iranius martin clumbo you know luther westbrook each one of those men had an angel and that's what people you know they either go one way or the other about it they either deny angels and they say well it's just the holy spirit or they'll go over the other way you know and they want to put angels over everything and if you notice christmas has got the angel out there now and her name is gloria and all of your scenes now they got a female angel well now brother brown said if you need that quote i'll be glad to run it up rank this afternoon he says no such things female angels he said when our angels don't have no gender see you'll be quick to say that all right but remember angels that are dealing with us have a gender that's why women don't preach right because you can't be classified in that form as an angel to be able to qualify as an angel minister i just try to put things down you know simple and everybody claims i'm so deep and whatever but i i just try to put it simple enough for the children to understand and the children would understand that and say well now we don't believe in female angels if there's going to be an angel and something comes to you you know my brother around him i got a quote in there he said people lay on it the angels come to them but if one comes into you floating around with wings all over the place you know that's out but then if one comes to you that's a female angel i'd advise you to get up and leave the room or do something right because you don't get hold the wrong time and you remember what brother branham said about who was it martin am i right that when satan came to him and if martin hadn't known the word do you know that satan was dressed identically according to what the word would eventually come to now you go back and check it will it not be a day come when jesus will have a crown do we not crown him satan come to him there with a crown on his head but see it clinton martin the saints one day will crown you so you're not supposed to have one now see if he hadn't knowed the word brother around said good pentecostal bait that's the way it is for the people this message isn't it some guy come along especially a young guy he jumps up and boys firing he's running he's going and people are just running all over the country following them and you know you don't even know what to say but let's go on so we see then the the church age messenger is an angel but if that church aged messenger and of course we know he was born again or he would have been the church age messenger right sensible i mean he had to be born again he wouldn't be the messenger run around with a choke somebody wasn't born again said we'll put him in our lane no no no that wouldn't have been nothing all right we see each church age got an angel and that angel fits in and we'll get to it in a minute we're only to redeem our angels and we'll read that but i want you to think about what it's saying in hebrews 1. especially verse 14 and it tells you about these angels it says they're ministering spirits sent forth listen to minister for them who are the heirs of salvation now you can see why we're going down in the number four on your notes we're brought around said only the redeemed of angels all right it's only redeemed to have angels everybody in the world don't have one now they may have the bad angels okay all right you with me they can have the bad angels they give us the nature yeah but when it comes to the good side they only have the only the redeemed of angels he said well now what about the little kids and the things like that now i'm not going to argue with you on that because i'm just plainly going to tell you because i gave you the quote we're right around them on page or 836 number five on your notes resurrection lazar 53 11 22. that everyone has a guardian angel now i don't believe everybody in the world has a guardian angel he said well you're denying right around now i'm taking the blood around him is telling you only the redeemed of angels now little children it's up to god to take care of him and i believe he does but let's don't deal with that let's worry about me and you we're not we're not little children all right let's think about me and you see that only the redeemed have angels all right now all the church age messengers are not sent to the world now their message condemns the world right but don't show me that the church is messenger sent to the world no he's not sent to the world he sent to the bride right now his message condemns the world right now are you with me his message he brings automatically condemns the world but the message he come to bring the that's where we'll get into it later with brother branham when that he has to do one work here and then something else has to take place and you'll see that he can be out he could be then not the messenger to lady ocean because the one-eyed black man was that messenger to lay your seal but he could come in lady oseah and rebuke him them and bring the message to you and i will get to that and they will tie together with something i said over and over and over but now think about it if the holy ghost is the only revealer of the word and an angel has to come each church age got an angel a messenger but that messenger had an angel he has something to do in his life because it's what it's to minister to the heirs of salvation amen well brother dale is just a holy spirit that comes to minister to all of us now your prophet said and i can give you a lot of quotes on it that people and we have one we'll get two or many or a couple of them where he said people say well it's just the holy ghost he said well then didn't peter have the holy ghost didn't paul have the holy ghost people say there's no such thing as angels in the new testament it was only in the old testament now your prophet said that but he said who was it that come to peter and paul and him he said they said an angel come now get one point as i said a while ago all of those angels that did not fall all right those angelic beings that did not fall for satan's lie they're all under direct supervision of the holy spirit all right now you're with me they're under direct supervision no i don't believe it so in the um in the good angels it didn't fall but over in the angels that did fall all those angels are fighting for positions trying to satisfy the big boy and gets what they can do because that's why brother brother said if god if satan can't get you was would drink it right he said he'll just get you with smoking see so one of the demons said okay i can't get him take over another one takes over see we don't think it's angels we think it's just good spirits and bad spirits well you better remember the first time god created was what angels that's the first thing he created is what your prophet said i'm sure it's on christ's mystery first thing he created was angels and they worshipped him and that made him god amen so don't think about angels as being just oh it's just spirits just floating around remember uh when uh elijah was in elisha that told you know open the eyes of the hazel there and said when he opened his eyes he said there's more for us than our them and he said one two one two look at all of them but when he opened his eyes he said he saw what chariots of fire and angels all around see we don't think they're real that's the point i want you to see today now i'm not if brother brown said we're not in the worship of angels we're not in fanaticisms big man that claimed to be the next messenger that was to come he's trying his best to tell me how his angels and even his own children they claim to recognize that there was something going on in the house around and it's the angels sometimes well either one or two things one thing for certain he didn't listen to the angel i'll put it that way because if it was an angel from god he would have told him the truth so we evidently got some other you know something else come on and the prophet now you say well well why is it that some people see angels and some don't now there's a quote in there i think it's the last one the bread around explains the reason we don't see angels he said because we don't dedicate ourself we don't consecrate ourselves to god we've got everything else on our mind and that's why we don't have visitation of angels so now who's to blind now brother dale you've told us about something you've seen but i just never seen nothing well you know whose fault it is all right that's what your prophet said so go ahead and argue on him now well it just ain't meant for us but when you get up there am i going to have to say there's an angel standing right there don't walk over too far and you can't see it now come on folks there's something wrong huh i shouldn't even be carnal like that but i try to make it plain enough to where you can understand i believe and i believed in angels before i ever saw anytime i believed the bible because i could read they're ministering spirits not just spirits see you know well it's just a spirit and that's what people think about god is just a spirit god is a spirit that scripture they don't think about him being real right my point is if i can get you convinced to see that angels are real real then maybe you'll understand god is real right brother brother said when that angel come in the room with him he said i've heard his voice and everything else i've seen all kinds of things happen whirlwinds all kind of things and having all kinds of things took place but he said when he walked in the room he said he was a man about 200 pounds he describes him he saw him right well why can't we well that was just for brother brandon all right that's why you don't see angles but now don't get caught up in fanaticism i remember a church one time this brother used to tell them about the pillar of fire being around they started bringing cameras and every time they come alive like well don't bring your cameras here cause you're gonna mess up my eyesight and you're gonna get everybody concerned did you feel that now do you believe it it's not what you feel it's what you believe you believe god's will you someday you'll come close enough you'll feel his presence don't worry about that you see only the redeemed have angels because they're sent to minister to the hours of salvation not sent to everybody in the world right but see we think we've got to be this at the other do you know that that geronimo we think he was the heathen you know the reason they couldn't capture geronimo a lot of times he had visions somebody with him a christian well go talk to him about it those guests and colleagues are without repentance but you see we just look at things and you know just the brother random uses the scripture on that quote 36 a resurrection of lazarus they're talking about all have a guardian angel and he said their angel always behold the father's face which is matthew 18 and 10. jesus said their angels behold my father's face kind of like it's real don't you think so psalms i guess it's thirty seven thirty four and seven that's the scripture that brother random one most of the time quote it but he quotes it a lot of times i've seen it he'll say the angel but most of the time he says the angels of the lord encountered about those who fear him the psalmist david knew about it but now here's what i want you to see do you believe that the angel that brother branham had he said was there from his birth to leaving the light was in the room get his home when his moment that's right you believe that he's an angel a real angel not just the holy spirit as a quote see but a real angel that came to it but you know what i'll show you it's not just the holy spirit that we're dealing with that angel couldn't save brother bran he never said he's saved because he saw an angel or heard a bush heard a voice up in a bush when he was seven years old and think right you know people ought to connect with a lot of things you know that brother branham was in his 20s before he ever was born again you better go read something he run from everything yet he knew there were great supernatural things taking place first thing he said he remembered was a vision he's 18 months old now i don't think any of you and i'm not gonna say i can remember anything i can't remember nothing like about four so of course i don't have very much memory anyway but i probably about four years old the best i can remember of anything i can remember do you remember anything about 18 months old no no not quite and i don't think so but a 18 month old child has got a lot of sins but you know just remembering that see the redeemed have angels right but that angel can't save you but yet the scripture says that he what he sent forth to minister for them listen who shall be heirs of salvation so he's given it to you when you're born that proves predestination his way he was talking about the other wisdom predestination what oh brother dale it's just seed assistance we still gonna have a life we gotta have a life and gotta get to a place right but it proves predestination if you can believe that you as a redeemed person had that angel my brother dale it looked like if i had an angel i would have done what i'd done i told you as a sinner i went out and done wrong he came home and felt dirty but you don't want you override that ass for a while and you won't feel dirty you'll feel happy you certainly won't feel dirty you remember the first time you've done something you felt bad what if that was that angel that was waiting on you to come to salvation what if that angel was protecting you all of your life brother random when he was a little boy wanted at one time he took a gun and was going to shoot these boys shot 22 times or something with a 22 rifle i've got 18 shots in it with a 22 rifle was gone fire gonna kill him and not one of them would fire and the boys ran away and when he did he picked him up put him back in the gun and every one of them fired who was taking care of him who was it that told him don't drink chew smoking thing because there's a work for you to do what if you and i would have listened to that we wouldn't be in the shape we're in today right is that blunt enough we wouldn't have done the things we've done he said well other people feel guilty i agree because being a having a soul being a normal being that's a moral obligation to do good right adolf hitler probably felt that too when he was a little kid but you see you claim to be redeemed today don't you you claim to have a new birth well you know what there was an angel with you the whole time driving you to it now did brother brown make this statement he said at one time the angels was placed at the garden of eden to keep away from them getting to the tree of life of that scripture right he said but now those angels are driving you to the tree of life amen using ministers using people to help you using natural angels right but using spiritual angels beings supernatural beings right that god had to open his eyes did elijah necessarily see him or he did he just know that there how many you are getting the points well that don't make no difference i'm just trying to make a point but he had to open hazel's eyes and let him see do you know what that never did convert to hazel i'm not knowing exactly where it's at it was but i believe it was after then when hazel sold out and tried to do all these things and wound up with leprosy but you see it's because we don't believe it those who he for knew the scripture said he did predestinate so if he predestinated you by his foreknowledge knowing you would come to it then when he was born an angel was assigned to him and it definitely was not the holy spirit to just say the holy spirit come to me when i was a baby and been with me ever since no no no an angel an angel see you think of all the things in your life that you could have been killed who took care of you god allows some things to happen to where that it takes place what about josh with the the wreck he was in and he was in the car by itself and three people testified that there was a man got out of the car and walked off and went down through the woods he said well josh is not necessarily claiming to say he born again well that's up to him between him and god because that doesn't have anything to do with it i took care of you well why didn't you keep me from doing wrong get tried well i told my brother when he told me one day he said god made me this way he can't condemn me for being like i am he made not to know he didn't make you that way and i was not on i don't even know then where i was in this message or not i said he didn't make you that way right so you made yourself i preach to you what i believe you put yourself in the pawn shop well the devil made me do it i don't blame him for everything right i volunteered for most of it what about you it was me that done it we don't believe they're really see then we don't believe god is able of doing anything what would be wrong with your thoughts and mentality of a human being to be able to comprehend if there is a living god a great eternal supreme being what would be the trouble of himself an angel to eat but just remember there's things that goes along with that because he also has to record what we do and has to report to the father our actions and our reactions in life so we need to be careful don't we if you're predestinated under salvation and if you're born again today you have to believe he was then why not believe that god sent an angel down good just the holy spirit brother dale well let's see what brother brown had to say we're about number six on your notes let's start reading see what he had to say about it we claim we believe him number six on your notes covers three paragraphs it's also obeying the voice of the angel priest in 1957-18 you coming down go to what's underlined it's basically you read the rest of it see what it says someone said not long ago to me brother brown angels were ministering spirits in the old testament but since the holy spirit has come we don't have ministering angels anymore now dear friends this is not a worship of angels understand we do not believe in worship and angels there's only one to be worshipped that's god and his son and our holy spirit no angel no no man or no angel to be worshipped now the angel of god a true angel of god would not not stand still to be worshiped but that you might know that angels still minister to the church after the holy ghost has come how about well think of mary no this one doesn't have it in it but there's one if it's not in the next one i got plenty of blade at the house on this part right here but in other words around brought up married to one person he said huh she wasn't in the new you testament he had him well sure compared to mary because new testament had come he said okay what about peter see they really thought they're smart at least what about peter what about paul what because now there's one exactly wording like that listen well think of mary when the gabriel came down and spoke to her about the virgin birth of the savior or like around the temple or well after the holy ghost come so he's after the holy ghost come how many believes that philip had the holy ghost we all believe that don't we well and when he was down at samaria preaching having a revival was it the holy ghost that came to him or did the angel of the lord touch him and say go to the desert vision the angel of the lord came to him is that true he was the angel of the lord that came to him well anyone would believe that the great saint peter the apostle had the holy ghost he had the keys to the kingdom and he had the holy ghost didn't he but when he was in jail one night and in prison and down at john mark's house they were having a prayer meeting it was the angel of the lord who came in and touched him and led not the holy spirit the angels of the lord came in we know that paul had the holy ghost do you believe that well he was 14 days and nights upon the sea without any moon stars and it was all dark he went down in the gallery to pray he came back and told a man be of good courage for the angel of god whose servant i am came to me last night and said fear not paul is that right not the holy spirit the angel of god see an angel of god sent from god listen and then john the revelator the whole book of revelations when it was wrote he said i have sent my angel john said i jesus said excuse me jesus did and john fell down to worship the angel but the angel said stand up worship god see a true angel of god didn't stand to be worshipped he said that he was of the prophets and he was his fellow men that had been sent to signify these things therefore angelic beings is ordained ministers of god to come to the earth to by record of god and they work through mortal beings just as they did through daniel and back through the ages and i believe it with all of my heart number seven angels of the lord matthew 51 502. i want you to know that that angel of god is no more to do with me listen that it is to do with you oh come on that is an angel sent down from heaven and if you don't believe angels are ministering spirits sent from the presence of god then you don't know the bible yes sir someone said brother branham angels is only for the old testament why that's an era the church had many angels ministering excuse me the church had more angels ministering than what the old testament did yes sir well they said the holy ghost leaves the church that's correct the holy ghost is over all come on stephen you see what i said while ago he's over everything this is the body and it's true but there's also ministry and spirit sent from the presence of god we know that mary and all of those were they all of those they seen angels and we know the new church seen angel how about you said do you believe philip had the holy ghost philip the evangelist after pentecost and he had the holy ghost didn't he who would have told him to go to the desert johnson and the angel of the lord came down is that right when he was having that revival at samaria peter had the holy ghost do you believe that and while they were having a prayer meeting from him at john mark's house the angel of the lord what was it a light shined in the window and the angel of the lord touched him and dropped the shackles off of him and put him outside of the building is that right and peter had the holy ghost to that right paul the apostle had the holy ghost do you believe it but after 14 days now the same quote for the angel of the lord whose servant i am and what and the whole book of revelation was showed john by an angel i jesus has sent my angel to testify is that right so angels are ministering spirits usually come in the form of lights and i through personally as i started to say a while ago with my bible over my heart i believe that the angel of god i've seen it since i was a little boy in that cabin they told me he'd come in that you seen the picture that the lady dropped last night on the little cabin where i was born i see people saying the holy spirit now you know you'll run around and say the holy spirit come in it's like brother joe was talking last night about you get to reading about something and then you get scriptures it don't sound something sounds like it's contrary but around them will say maybe the holy spirit come in the little captain here he says the knights will come in the cave oh that's just the holy spirit see you're not getting it the holy spirit can use an angel to make something personal because it's not jesus coming down to personally walk up to you hey now wait no but an angel can do that you can take on a form and come down expectation 1958 10. someone told me here not long ago said brother brown sitting there why don't you give all the praise to the holy ghost and say that's the holy spirit excuse me praise to the holy spirit and say that's the holy spirit i said my brother i must be truthful and there's a blank spot on the table whether it's the holy spirit i said it it's it it's a gift sent from god he never said he was the holy spirit never told me who he was he said i'm sent from the presence of god and you know what people know you know people also why are you asking his name he says you don't talk on one quote when he's died i didn't know who it was never said anything to john will palace about who it was i don't know who it was i mean you're just a busy one get born again get out of that garbage can he said i'm sent from the presence of god and it does not feel like the holy spirit when it comes listen to it the holy spirit makes me feel happy but when that comes around it isn't that feeling it's a very sacred august feeling like and it's different but it's sent from god he said run around the ministers angels that was back in the old testament with daniel and so forth but that's some hero friends that that that that is wrong he said since the holy ghost come the holy ghost leads the church that's the truth the holy ghost leaves the church that is true but there's ministry and spirit sent from god special gifts friends sent from god on the message i am the resurrection 1952-18 and i'll read it and make a gaps or anybody on tape you just read it all god still has angels programming every 17 and they visit the people not a worship of angels but angelic beings who are attributes of god another thing as i said there's going to be a lot of attributes when we get over on that other side that i don't think we're going to know about here my brother i found the quote around in jesus all attributes hey man i believe in it well there's a lot about jesus we don't know we're going to have an eternity of knowing about what took place on this earth we're just going to get enough here that's what i want you to see and what's not sure we're just going to get enough here to be able to go there amen then god will take care of it but that's what he said drop down on just a little bit where the line is now this angel came he was gabriel now god sends minor angels that's right perhaps the ones that come the one comes here now you know where i gave you the quotes for a brother brother said that his was maybe a minor angel i speculated quite a while ago i'll find him for you he said maybe a minor angel i'd like for you to find extra 63 that he said he was minor perhaps the one to come here some people will actually puff their minds up with angels now listen to it and things who they think they have seen and things like that that's just the counterfeit right because listen this is right on e18 if a man has seen an angel of god and met his commission student met god he is commissioned or that angel commissioned him from god and it was sent from god it'll be a record right down the line that's the truth you believe that if it doesn't it isn't the truth that's one thing you can depend on by their fruits you shall know them that's truth greatest battle ever fought 1963-311 and here the bible comes right back and tells us here that god sends forth angels glory what are they ministering spirit glory ministering spirit simply sent word from the presence of god what to do ministries word see now you're getting down to people on earth preachers that claim to be preachers are supposed to be angels well i must worry about what brother brown was right or not right we shouldn't by now but what about earthly messengers preacher now not if i say white instead of blue and people was arguing one time whether or not i was called of god and they said look at that he made a mistake he's 80 miles apart he said he's 60. now here the bible comes right back and tells us here that god sends forth angels glory what are they ministering spirits glory ministering spirit sent word from the presence of god to do what now remember what we read up here at the top of it that they were angelic beings were attributes of god now preacher not mama called daddy sent a preacher what makes me any different than you a call a commission would not that angel in your life have something to do with your commission i'm talking about your angel it's a sign of your birth i'm talking about your only redeemed i'm an angel that's what i'm talking about wouldn't that be something so when god assigned me one he knew i was going to be a preacher i said last night to the people then he prepared m uh joshua moses was in there you know but joshua was right there beside moses all the time getting ready to take over when moses stepped out of the way right he's training some of you to step over i may step out of the way i may be taken out of the way that's up to god i don't know my business don't worry about who's going to step up and take over if they come in here put a gun to my head and shoot who's going to take over and say give me next amen ministry of spirit sent from the present word from the presence of god to what minister the word amen you're not to minister some theology or some denominational group diminished but to minister his word that's it ministering spirit sent forth oh that's only for brother branham well i thought the fightful ministry was for perfecting the science i just believe the scripture what the prophet said how do they know how do we know they are now how do you know whether dale is called a preacher not i don't know i wouldn't know if he preaches his own theology his own denominational ideas you know real quick he's not called a god come on how do we know they are the bible said that the word of the lord came to the prophets oh you think you're prophet well i thought brother branham said this was a prophetic age i thought this was the age of the eagle i thought the bride i'm quoting brother branhamwood to be prophetic right but you see we read prophets who do you think you are you think you won the prophets no i'm just one of the more believers in the body of christ amen but i'm a minister called to preach is that right these angels minister his word through his spirit minister the word through the holy spirit and the spirit and the word comes to the prophets and the prophet said the word of god that's the reason they do the miracles that they did it wasn't the man it was the spirit of god in the man the spirit of christ and the man for the word of god goes on down right that's paragraph just come on down the same message page that was page 27 greatest battle this is page 30 greatest better yes sir these are ministering spirits sent from the presence of god to ministry to minister what his word not some theology but god's word their ministering spirit sent from god to minister ministering spirits lord i remember if if it's ministering something besides a word it don't come from god because the word the word thy word is always confirmed in heaven trying to hurry up just a few minutes in the message resurrection of lazarus 53 11 22 he said but an angel a true angel of god will always point you to jesus christ paul said if an angel from heaven come and preach any other gospel than which you have already heard let him be a curse is that right see watch what the angel teaches if it's bringing if it's bringing along in the gospel and sound and doctrine and everything according to the bible then believe it so god always send angelic beings to warn the world now now we're just going to read just a few times but he sends angelic beings to warn the world did not three angels go down to sodom was that not god and two angels yes was that not god that just spoke a body and spoke a body for them and they walked down was that not who it was angels listen to what he said i believe that those angelic beings in the earth today are warning the world of judgment to come i could go a little bit on your flying saucer here for just a few minutes he said don't take that much time god sat down i ain't angel's down there to call a lot out that's the quote right in front of you five junctions of time 56 122. the united states is shaking the great bureaus and so forth in the great pentagon and all of that investigating supernatural things flying saucers what are they oh they say we see little men in them all kind of stories they try to deny but they're there why god said there would be signs in the heavens above in the earth we got it afraid christmas mystery god revealed 63 728 did you notice the angels that come down investigated sodom before sodom was destroyed you remember that there was a bunch of them come down three of them one of them stayed with abraham you remember that they were lights from heaven that came down in the investigating judgment one look where they're all found around the pentagon and things they find them that's the world judgment sodom north at night 65 68 15 see the world don't know what that is you know you know it's all in we know what it is see we know it's investigating judgment angels you see and they howl at the pentagon all about how it comes right down to the intelligence listen how they go like a flash and be gone pull away from anything they got see and they don't realize what it is see let them think whatever they want to they call them flying saucers or whatever they don't know just one second brother branham says and i'll give you the quote it's in the 50s 56 i think he said russia has she had airplanes all right we knew that at the end of the war because the germans had jet airplane didn't know how to control them so then when they divided the berlin wall we got half the scientists and they got half the scientists and they had jet airplanes russia probably prior to us we also said they had flying saucers russia yes they spy on us all they want to because see they're super intelligence and see then they don't know what to do and they can just fly among us and leave and do well if we got stokes bombers we got those things 1962 francis powers was shot down in the youtube pilot of a plane that is more sophisticated than the steps bombers are today that was 1962. i happened to read these steps bombers they said they was gonna get floated money you know to try to get the government okay to build them they had two photo tops made you know and they wanted them in less than 30 to 60 days later they had 15 the first flight that went into kuwait so where'd it come from so we've got investigating angels also people we've got fine saucers take a man pull his ears up twist him up a little bit make him look like a monkey let him fly around just in case he falls and russia's got him but god's got amen and see that's the reason they can't figure out what's going on see because they try to track certain ones of them and when they try to track them they can't find them well because they're from god and they just went off believe everything you never heard the story how that hitler came up with a blimp and you had a man suspended hundreds or hundreds of feet below that blimp in a little room with i mean little platform with a phone to call up and tell them and they couldn't figure out how come that the germans would come in and was so accurate with their bombing and it seemed like that even if they flew over and bombed and they missed a place they would just back up and bomb again the guy was sitting there telling them you missed it so many hundred feet back up so they got so excited about it they finally figured out what was taking place you know what they've done they started shooting in the clouds and the planes just flew over and bombed them just towel them up because they're shooting into the clouds thinking they haven't you understand what i'm saying the russians are flying around we're flying around everybody's fighting on each other and all of that though god has his angels that are flying around he's getting so confused they don't know what's going on they don't know whose plane is who because there are angels to come down to check on us now don't ask me how come god does it maybe he limits himself as i tried to preach but in sodom remember what the story was come on brother boyd you remember what the story was in sorry when it come down to abraham the man that came to abraham said i've wondered of what the things that have said about what's taking place is true or not so i came down i can't let me read this while they're getting ready then we'll just play and just sing a verse or something and then we'll be through message the resurrection preach 53 1205. you know what i think today the reason that we don't have no angelic visit don't have more angelic visitations than we do now listen we who call ourselves christians play cards half the night read old crew story magazines have beer and ice box and that's the reason angels don't visit us you can't mix oil and water you can't mix only the reason we don't have the visitation of angels we don't stay sincere listen to what he says here one revelations book of symbols 1956 angelic beings associate together i hope you get that that just dropped right down free look and if you've got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the unseen world and the supernatural no wonder people don't believe in those things they never come in contact they've got nothing in here to believe with listen but when the holy spirit comes into the heart quickly he becomes then a twofold being one of the earth to die the other and of heaven to live in his body he still subject to death but his soul has passed some depth into life in his body he has earthly contact with his sins five senses in his spirit he has a contact with god through the holy ghost and the angels of god visits them and speaks with them and they are messengers sent from god to reveal and to bring messages from god to the individual he's out to get the first thing first right obeying his voice 1957-13 but god's gift is the spirit of god that came down in the form of an angel in the form of an angel now listen what he says you talk about when it come to him come on read it now he didn't have wings he looked like a man i heard him when he walked right around millstreet just as that and walked on the floor walked right over just as normal as any man talks just like any man he comes time after time through the room in different places when i'm fasting and praying so when he was getting himself out of the way is when the angel came maybe that's our trouble you remember one time billy paul had always asked to see the angel the brother and spoke up but around him asked the angel one day could he could build a call see he said bill paul on me he said i'll stand right over here he said you turn him and tell him and paul said i'm look and there stood a man but then he was gone he let him see angels are real folks it's not just i feel a spirit understand we're just saying one song one verse or something everybody has a need because 103. anybody have any we don't we're gonna quit praying if you come to the altar but i'm gonna just come in let's see let's see you're going trees little boy there that's brother sweeties sister sweeting had open heart surgery but joe's standing for her that god would take care of me and everybody take care of that little baby so you know thank god for people that will help and new things but let's believe father in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ sister sweeting needs you in a marvelous way lord to bring her out of this place and restore her to the rightful place that where she can take care of this grandchild of hers we pray that you would just reach down and touch her our brother stands in the place for her so we believe and we thank you in jesus name anybody else that have a need don't grieve the angel of god is as you what the lord angels are real when we get older we'll see angels all over the place i believe the closer we get to the supernatural the closer those angels can appear what happened that day when that gun was six inches to barely end of it or more from my head and it went off what took care of me then when i piece at a bar i had pieces of lead in my forehead i what took care of you recognize it we shall is we couldn't go out there maybe and talk to them the right way about him but we can believe we can say that maybe you laid upon our sister's heart for that purpose here because we couldn't go there we just ask you father to go there and touch jane and make everything well we love you father and we thank you in jesus name anybody else is as you father we thank you for today and we ask you now to just go with us need a natural meal lord be back with us this afternoon bless us and guide us and keep us in
