[0:00] campers on
[0:04] I'm
[0:07] I've got it on maybe I'll see you being
[0:13] a little bit
[0:28] it's going to be still going to be a
[0:29] little bit difficult to read but i'll
[0:32] give the course
[0:37] alright Justin
[0:44] listen before we get into this let's go
[0:47] to Lauren frame okay but Jesus we just
[0:49] thank you John for opening a real word
[0:51] for the privilege together in order
[0:53] today Igor great an orgy or should you
[0:55] leave a bit of weight as he smashed and
[0:57] to make them leave all the ones that are
[0:58] sick and afflicted it couldn't be here
[1:00] today on which the services this morning
[1:02] from my heart so I kind of want to take
[1:12] up but this is a scripture that's that's
[1:15] really familiar to all the ones that
[1:17] have been in a message for a long time
[1:19] so you know a lot of times we think that
[1:22] that things have to be a lot of new
[1:25] things have to be brought out but I want
[1:29] to kind of focus on just one of the ones
[1:31] that are maybe the main point of the
[1:33] message really you know when I when I
[1:35] was growing up I when I first really got
[1:37] things throughout the message a lot of
[1:39] us forget on the phone you know if you
[1:41] if you gonna settle up the message look
[1:44] how to do you know and you know it's
[1:48] good to get inspired about the message
[1:50] to see what the essential essential
[1:52] three and of the message really is if
[1:55] you look at what what the answer that
[1:59] Jesus gave to them when they were like
[2:01] where where will the the ones that are
[2:04] ones in the bed he's taken ones in the
[2:06] field he was taking all these are taken
[2:08] away and it seems real mysterious and
[2:10] the answer he gives is is also seems
[2:13] real mysterious but I believe the gospel
[2:16] can be simplified if unica
[2:19] usually when he broke the bread and the
[2:20] fish as he gave it out to his disciples
[2:23] to break out to the people and I believe
[2:25] that it can be simplified in a way
[2:27] that's real easy to understand and see
[2:30] what the answer that Jesus gave
[2:34] wheresoever that you go wheresoever the
[2:37] body is a little where the Eagles be
[2:38] gathered together in Matthew there
[2:40] whatever the carcass is the Eagle will
[2:42] be getting together that that's the
[2:44] thread of the whole message the thread
[2:46] of how you get born again how you grow
[2:48] as a christian how you grow in the
[2:50] statute perfect man and how you'll take
[2:51] a body change so where will the eagle's
[2:54] be gathered together is that you're
[2:56] asking where are these people get going
[2:58] to go they're going to go to the Lord
[3:00] for as a lightning that lightning out of
[3:05] the one part under hitters shina Thunder
[3:07] the other partner in a social also the
[3:09] son of man being his day I asked the
[3:11] scripture right before that the first
[3:13] must suffer many things and be rejected
[3:15] of this generation and you know that in
[3:18] a message masterpiece program toddler
[3:21] that that beginning of the first it went
[3:25] in Christ's ministry parallels what's
[3:27] happening down here in the end where
[3:30] Christ is manifest in the flesh again
[3:32] and the bride will be persecuted abroad
[3:35] will be pushed out the denominations the
[3:37] drive will be miss Erskine when when the
[3:40] bride begins to say I my father one of
[3:41] these other things that shoka pull away
[3:43] that visitors through the same way that
[3:46] Jesus was so he's speaking about himself
[3:48] but he's also speaking about what's
[3:50] happening today but first must suffer
[3:53] many things
[3:53] this generation and as it was in the day
[3:56] of Noah so shall i be offered in the
[3:59] nays of the son of man so I want to just
[4:02] kind of slowly and methodically take a
[4:04] little tour of some of these scriptures
[4:06] and remind us of what we're doing
[4:08] because we're we're eating all the body
[4:11] horde of Christ and that's our main
[4:12] thing the main focus of the Christian
[4:14] that is today is so easy to get
[4:17] distracted by the other thing you just
[4:18] look around and talk to people and they
[4:20] get so distracted my office telling me
[4:23] that she's listening to people that are
[4:25] all these people that are leaving in the
[4:26] message now disable all these years we
[4:30] didn't know what the message was about
[4:32] and i would agree that's the problem you
[4:34] don't know what the message was about
[4:36] and if somebody said i'm getting this a
[4:38] little bit somebody said I one of the
[4:40] reasons why I don't believe the program
[4:42] was improper was because he didn't give
[4:44] enough credit to Clarence Larkin and
[4:47] they say stole a lot of what Clarence
[4:49] Larkin says well I really got in and
[4:52] study in Clarence Larkin and if you know
[4:54] what got real talk then you can see that
[4:58] he didn't steal that and I'll make a
[5:00] little bit longer i'll get into some of
[5:01] the things like like Clarence Larkin did
[5:04] not understand that the souls innermost
[5:06] being a man he put it body soul and in
[5:10] spirit but now brother Brennan by a holy
[5:12] ghost could and that's a good thing
[5:14] Clarence Marvin didn't understand he he
[5:16] said Christ and the Holy Spirit were two
[5:18] different things no now now now see that
[5:23] programs not getting his message from
[5:25] Clarence Larkin he's getting it from a
[5:27] boat oh this is the message that came
[5:28] down like jesus said I am that bread of
[5:31] life that came down from heaven and that
[5:33] bread of life that came down from heaven
[5:34] was given to us through a trumpet to
[5:37] catch us up to take us to the word we're
[5:41] doing the word
[5:45] now that what he says where the carcass
[5:48] is the Eagles going to gather not the
[5:50] chickens the earth lamb bird the
[5:54] heavenly Eagle will gather with the
[5:56] carcass a chicken is is cousin is down
[6:00] you or Madison everything else can eat
[6:02] with the eagle put some this way up
[6:04] there in a tree nobody can get to that
[6:06] parasites don't bother them they fly too
[6:08] high a lot of predators and roses things
[6:10] is not going about it in he isn't evil
[6:13] they like Eagle food and that's that's
[6:17] the thing i want to focus in this
[6:18] morning this is going to be real simple
[6:20] but Eagles like Eagle food that's what
[6:23] your desire is that's what your nature
[6:26] is to follow after equal for nothing
[6:28] else will satisfy and because you
[6:32] because you're after Eagles for your
[6:34] feeding on the Word of God and then you
[6:36] begin to know who you are what your
[6:37] place is and what the plan is you know
[6:40] where those weather where the rapture is
[6:42] going to take you and how to get there
[6:45] and the chicken don't don't know seeking
[6:48] don't understand anything he's afraid of
[6:49] rats and is what a ride I think it's
[6:52] real funny when I go out and feed our
[6:53] chickens we got this feed bag and
[6:56] sometimes you know if you flap that
[6:58] feedback then it just calls the chaos
[7:00] because if that feedback sounds like
[7:02] eagles wings flapping anything they're
[7:04] going to get evening so they just watch
[7:07] it just is a little bit fun don't tell
[7:11] my wife that she
[7:15] but see there's a difference between the
[7:18] eagle and the chicken now I beseech you
[7:22] brethren mark in Roman 1617 causes now
[7:25] beseech you brother and mark them what
[7:27] cause divisions in the fences contrary
[7:29] to the doctrine which he had learned and
[7:31] avoided they that are such serving on
[7:34] our Lord Jesus cried but the Christ but
[7:36] their own belly and by good words and
[7:39] fair speeches to see the hearts of the
[7:41] symbol because it I focus is on the word
[7:46] so many today or I put a focus on
[7:49] atmosphere and creating a good song
[7:53] service and things and that's what so
[7:55] many people's focuses on our own
[7:57] legalism and different things but the
[7:59] real word of God will attract a real
[8:02] believer and that's what will take us
[8:04] interaction and you can see I'm getting
[8:07] on the tube you know grandpa target it's
[8:10] 3 believers a real believer and make
[8:13] believe you're an unbeliever and out all
[8:15] down through the scripture that is the
[8:17] two side by side as you go to lamb and
[8:19] governor and the crew and a raven
[8:21] there's disease too and it's real close
[8:26] at the end time and the way did you tell
[8:29] the way that you tell it is by the word
[8:32] you got and you know all down to the
[8:34] scripture of a puppet through growing up
[8:36] you know you hear people say giving the
[8:37] word test until it almost becomes such a
[8:40] common thing and I'm to give them the
[8:42] word test means I see if you if you
[8:44] believe my own opinion but you have you
[8:47] know take it back to the scripture and
[8:49] take it back to work
[8:50] messages and compare it to what the
[8:54] Bible the Bible sensing you know but
[8:57] what what this is speaking of i believe
[8:59] is today nobody understood so many don't
[9:02] understand the real essence of the
[9:04] message so we school let me try to come
[9:06] up with little distractions and things
[9:08] like like well they'll mention that John
[9:10] 666 and no things in the future there
[9:13] are interesting and but there you know
[9:15] it pulls your focus from the essence of
[9:18] the message the essence of the scripture
[9:21] that gets the statue a perfect man that
[9:23] what was the vid hidden the seals and
[9:25] God was revealed himself in flesh to
[9:27] take us to making manifest again as a
[9:30] son of man on this last day so that so
[9:33] that we can take a body change now
[9:35] that's the essence of the message that I
[9:37] really got inspired by something way
[9:40] seven liters speaking because he was
[9:41] talking he made mention of that bit that
[9:43] so many fail to see the essence of the
[9:45] message that and I absolutely agree i
[9:48] think that's that just that just really
[9:52] grieves me and excites me at the same
[9:54] time that so many are failing to see
[9:58] what god is doing in this day the loop
[10:04] will all sit at Secca current is 11 3
[10:06] but I fearless by any means as a serpent
[10:08] beguiled Eve through his subtlety so
[10:11] your mind should be corrupted from the
[10:13] simplicity that is in Christ now see we
[10:17] don't want some neva grand and
[10:18] complicated and
[10:19] Hughes but it's real simple that that
[10:23] scripture where the carcass is that
[10:25] equal to be gather together that's real
[10:26] simple but we don't want that we want
[10:28] something I'll complicate complicated
[10:30] and a big to-do emotion and and and and
[10:37] and a lot of distractions instead of
[10:40] just getting them and it can it be as
[10:43] simple as brother I'm saying read your
[10:46] Bible every day and pray pray pray
[10:48] program how do I get closer to God well
[10:50] you know where you go you know to
[10:54] purchase a thousand books or different
[10:55] theologians and things but it's as
[10:57] simple as read your Bible every day and
[11:01] pray pray pray but because we fail to
[11:05] see the simplicity in Christ call afraid
[11:09] that will be beguiled to the sub tility
[11:13] of the serpent they come in and get us
[11:15] distracted from the real pure Word of
[11:18] God for if he that cometh pritchett
[11:20] another Jesus Emily I'm not priests or
[11:22] if you receive out of spirit which you
[11:24] have not received and or another gospel
[11:27] which you have not accepted you might
[11:30] you might well bear with I'm afraid if
[11:33] someone comes in teaching something this
[11:34] contractor work you'll put up with you
[11:37] put up with what with the nonsense for I
[11:40] suppose I was not a whit but not a very
[11:42] chiefest apostles now I love this
[11:45] scripture because everybody likes to
[11:46] quote what Paul says how I was a sheep's
[11:49] of sinners and everything but here your
[11:51] palms making this confession and that's
[11:53] what will offend everybody when the
[11:55] bride begins to realize who she is and
[11:57] says I and my father are one and I do
[12:02] nothing but the will of the Father and
[12:03] all these
[12:04] thank you so when he comes he's making a
[12:07] statement a confession that he knows
[12:09] what he places I was not a whit behind
[12:11] the very key first apostles oh my
[12:13] goodness how are you making something
[12:15] longer sick and that's the same thing
[12:17] they said a brother random Hickam just
[12:19] like Paul came with an angel and a cloud
[12:22] and a pillar of fire and all these
[12:23] things he's not making something of
[12:25] himself he's showing he showing the
[12:27] people a message but though I be rude
[12:29] and speech yet not acknowledge but we
[12:31] have been truly made manifest among you
[12:34] and all things like uh was it was a
[12:39] Nathaniel came whomping to jesus and
[12:41] jesus said behold here's a man and whom
[12:44] there is different it has no God I can
[12:45] see right through and there's no
[12:47] deception it's just right playing out
[12:50] and open and I believe that's how the
[12:52] gospel should be preached it should be
[12:54] preached and simplicity just made
[12:56] benefit just but made plain so that you
[12:59] can you can make your own decision about
[13:00] it not me not on complicated and not
[13:03] trying to drum up something fancy but
[13:06] just the Word of God is what will
[13:09] attract the Eagles attention it'll
[13:11] attract a big fish for green and that's
[13:15] what's going to take us interaction and
[13:18] then the ones at the end time when he
[13:21] said Moses was an eagle they never give
[13:23] the children of God knoweth leftovers he
[13:25] had the fresh Word of God now now I was
[13:29] read through on what Martin Luther had
[13:31] to say he wrote this thing about the
[13:32] seven marks of the body church how the
[13:34] church would be identified and the very
[13:37] first thing was he said the first first
[13:39] the holy Christian people are recognized
[13:41] by their possession of the whole
[13:43] word of god and i agree with that
[13:45] because that's what identifies a
[13:47] Christian in this day and every day now
[13:50] Paul had the word for his day that see
[13:54] it you got to say what the messenger
[13:58] saving you own a Martin Luther change
[14:00] you had to say what the messenger saying
[14:02] could come up with something new order
[14:04] that's the same thing in this day we
[14:07] can't come up with some newfangled ideas
[14:08] something additional to what he said
[14:10] because everything that he said he gave
[14:14] us everything we need to get in to take
[14:16] a body change we don't need to add
[14:18] anything to it will need to come up with
[14:20] was strange little types or and
[14:22] strangely shadows and things that he did
[14:24] put there because we're we're uh we're
[14:28] recognized by receiving the word for our
[14:31] day and the mana is the word that's
[14:37] where the he was to get it now you know
[14:41] look at these two is to kind of
[14:42] characters the dough and the Raven they
[14:44] live as they left from the art that the
[14:47] water began to recede know enough to the
[14:49] arc any left uh no balloons then let the
[14:51] ravenous and their character showed
[14:54] where they were attracted to you now now
[14:56] the Raven likes the word to the rainy
[15:00] could eat the work but one has gone he
[15:03] ever done that the Dove he'll kill him
[15:06] if he eats stuff of the world false
[15:10] doctrine things that he shouldn't be
[15:12] that I need to tent there's something in
[15:15] him that will attract him you know
[15:16] brother Brendan compared he even use
[15:19] that too tight of a bank's line
[15:20] Christian that uh there's so many times
[15:24] that he he prepared in this little story
[15:25] and say the dog went out and tried to
[15:28] find food before the water and preceded
[15:30] him and it wasn't nothing nothing but
[15:31] trash it came back and couldn't stomach
[15:33] it it came back to the ark and that's
[15:36] the same way with a backslidden
[15:37] Christian will do you and get a little
[15:39] bit sliding to the bible reading prayer
[15:41] life anything you try try to satisfy
[15:44] with something else
[15:45] it just can't stomach it because of
[15:47] killing there's something inside having
[15:48] this job until the real word of god and
[15:50] you can't stand it so you're basically
[15:53] going to circle back or like that that
[15:55] brother that was drinking beer
[15:57] everything God just take you off the
[15:59] scene cause you're not nervous it's not
[16:03] right but but look these two nature's
[16:05] now one can stomach the things of the
[16:07] world and when the other one cannot and
[16:14] there's the story he simple if the
[16:15] Raider ones worth went forth to and fro
[16:17] into the waters were dried up from off
[16:19] the earth but the dog found the rest for
[16:21] the sole of her foot and she would turn
[16:22] into mmv are now I just I just want to
[16:25] expose these two natures and think about
[16:27] this a little bit because you know you
[16:30] say well I just can't harvest and
[16:31] Elizabeth Brown I don't I don't like to
[16:34] listen to the tapes and the books and
[16:35] pink and I just can't only find time to
[16:38] do it maybe it i hate i hate the sound
[16:42] of roughing everything but maybe examine
[16:43] your nature because you know you can
[16:47] look at free will others interested in
[16:49] story three wheels as you've got you got
[16:50] a choice but that Raven and you don't
[16:54] have the nature to choose right to do
[16:57] right your free will is to a great
[17:00] extent governed by that nature thank God
[17:03] puts inside of me until God puts his
[17:05] nature inside of you you can't you can't
[17:08] fake it I mean you can fake it you try
[17:10] to like that store where he try to put
[17:12] Rowan talk about putting the fake
[17:14] feathers in I'll hood all the fake
[17:16] feathers in here you'd like the Raven
[17:18] could Michael insurance and say well i'm
[17:19] in church i listen to the same certainly
[17:22] love is here i am but but there's
[17:25] something that inside is just not crazy
[17:27] like what psalm 42 or david but that's
[17:31] an example of prayer time for tuna I
[17:33] think that's where these he says the
[17:35] dealer payment after water book and then
[17:37] it was a scripture up that one of the
[17:38] verses hasn't he Portwenn any cravings
[17:41] and I pour my soul out that because
[17:43] there's something alone and something
[17:45] deep Colin to eat its without the word
[17:49] being inside you living then you
[17:52] you can't there's nothing to really pull
[17:55] and draw all that debt to draw you
[17:57] toward a word that's that's the
[18:01] difference between the dough and the
[18:04] rain here's the nature of the duck James
[18:07] 317 the wisdom that is from a bow that
[18:10] with them through God his first pure
[18:13] than peaceful gentleman he could it be
[18:15] entreated full of mercy and good fruits
[18:17] without partiality and without talking
[18:20] she and the fruit of righteousness is
[18:22] sown in peace a limb that make peace
[18:27] because now now a lot of people get
[18:30] confused when they read isn't anything
[18:32] that ad of nature is a pushover but a
[18:35] dove is trying to fulfill the word of
[18:38] god that's what he's attracted to he's
[18:39] attracted to God's Word painful field
[18:41] now that's why Jesus will go into the
[18:44] temple and pick up cat o nine tails and
[18:46] whatever he picked up and can whip the
[18:48] people out because he was interested and
[18:50] seeing God's Word fulfilled so I naked
[18:53] on nature in a man in a person the dog
[18:57] is at the nature of Christ the Dove is
[19:00] wanting to see God's Word fulfilled now
[19:05] push it over not somebody will just take
[19:06] whatever so I just wrote some notes down
[19:11] the dub moves past environmental
[19:14] distractions and that's what I believe
[19:15] her for the Vernon was pretty nylon
[19:17] lining and you know because you will get
[19:20] some centered on what somebody does does
[19:22] I made sure that hurts our feelings will
[19:25] build up complexes we'll look at what
[19:27] other people do scarecrows to the church
[19:29] different things or functional Social
[19:31] Affairs like what we start treating the
[19:33] treatment search like a social gathering
[19:35] instead of place where you can come into
[19:36] the Word of God but what a dumb is
[19:40] really
[19:41] it don't matter how many people hurt you
[19:44] feel is everything that does is going
[19:45] barrel past all that and get to the word
[19:47] that you know that that really hurts but
[19:51] I've got to get to the word England if
[19:54] the word is behind a whole football team
[19:57] of scarecrows and her feelings and
[20:00] complex is everything a nomadic to the
[20:03] dub it is is going to bail right on
[20:05] through and get to it cause that's that
[20:09] is what attracts the Dove lamb the Eagle
[20:14] all these little animals another Raven
[20:18] you know one of the right some of these
[20:20] characteristics of rape a ravenous is
[20:22] they say Raiders are even more
[20:23] intelligent and then apparent they can I
[20:26] e-courses illegal to own one but if you
[20:28] could you know they'll be a really
[20:30] interesting bird go home because they
[20:31] can they think I almost think they're so
[20:34] smart and things they can choose if you
[20:36] asked to give me the green block and
[20:38] things they can pick the right ball but
[20:43] it tells us you can be real intelligent
[20:47] and get off of Word of God and just miss
[20:50] the whole thing it's not how intelligent
[20:52] you are it's didn't believe God's Word
[20:54] and then think of that the Ravens one of
[20:56] the meanest birds that's what program
[20:58] said and he can eat wheat but he can
[21:02] also the trash now look when when the no
[21:05] were released that dove that Raven out
[21:08] of the are there was a all that detritus
[21:11] and decaying stuff laying out there from
[21:14] all those cattle and all those people
[21:16] that have died it was always sitting out
[21:18] there decayed and the filth and that's
[21:21] what the ravening here he'd go hideous
[21:23] doing that and it didn't kick because
[21:25] his nature wasn't change there was
[21:28] something in him there wasn't it wasn't
[21:30] that nature to draw into the word my
[21:34] brother I said in first woman God the
[21:36] Holy Therns to be like him and then you
[21:38] see that his word is in you vindicating
[21:41] itself that you are God's servant now
[21:44] that's what attracts Christian is when
[21:46] you see God's Word being vindicated
[21:48] something change something taking place
[21:54] let me kind of jump ahead a little bit
[22:03] see the harvest steinberger and said
[22:06] look being gone after adamant Phil tried
[22:08] by order filter on continued in his
[22:10] creation to try to find a man who would
[22:12] live every word now look he tried to
[22:14] find me that is live the word for his
[22:16] age now you see God scattered his word
[22:19] out cause of tooth he's trying to find
[22:22] somebody it's a personal affair he's
[22:25] trying to find somebody that will get
[22:26] will make your word manifest see how
[22:30] close me there's a goat and lamb and
[22:33] look look at this quote brother I'm said
[22:36] an angel / back in 1951 it's if you
[22:39] better get sealing the kingdom of God by
[22:40] the Holy Ghost while you got a chance
[22:41] you talked about the fusing time isn't
[22:45] coming when the Bible said they'd be so
[22:46] close till it will see the very leg if
[22:49] possible hey remember we talked about
[22:52] sunday school lessons about how Babel is
[22:55] confusion and everything now that you
[22:58] get into the Word of God and what's
[23:00] confusing is to melt away into what and
[23:02] the simplicity of the word of God and
[23:04] you'll begin to understand it's not it's
[23:07] not supposed to be confusing look here's
[23:11] another nature of it the devil wants to
[23:14] be paid it takes a real cheap razor
[23:17] another difference when it bleed of a
[23:18] god go to the land the devil wants to be
[23:20] petty gotta get that nature change so
[23:23] that your focus is on the Word of God
[23:25] not so much being patted and and having
[23:29] everything your way and they prefer
[23:30] being struck the right way but it open
[23:36] you know a lot of these little things of
[23:38] life I believe when we look back when we
[23:40] get a room upside we look back and say
[23:42] whoa well you know it
[23:44] that Burleson got mad because I mean I
[23:47] here we are we're living eternal life
[23:49] forever ever with God and we're just
[23:51] getting along and this is so wonderful
[23:54] and then we can take that mindset of how
[23:57] wonderful it's going to be then and
[23:59] apply now just look around maybe change
[24:01] our the way we look at things all I know
[24:04] penny feelings don't matter at all
[24:06] compared to what I have not seen know
[24:08] you're hurt what's in store for those
[24:11] are loving and see a land was willing to
[24:14] forfeit its rice a mile and makes war
[24:16] will I try a lamb has to be led and let
[24:19] us go to leave lambs to the slaughter
[24:21] didn't jump out why cause he ain't
[24:22] committee he's not he's not interested
[24:25] in going all the way to the cross hill
[24:28] hill you know lead the lamps of the
[24:31] slaughter and then jump out and say well
[24:33] I wasn't really interested in this
[24:35] journey that you don't and a lamb knows
[24:38] the Shepherd's voice because he's
[24:39] interested in the world cup John 10 45
[24:44] he said we put forth his own shoe
[24:47] the phone and she following for they
[24:48] know his voice and a stranger will they
[24:50] not followed but will flee from you will
[24:53] flee from him for they know not the
[24:56] voice of strangers anything that's off
[24:59] the voice of God now here's what I
[25:05] really like hold your panties because
[25:09] this is this is key right here God can
[25:12] make you a different nature man or woman
[25:15] say well I y'all free clean everything
[25:19] and maybe don't see what the word and
[25:24] we'll God can change change you from
[25:26] home free click over to to you can
[25:30] change it from a raven to to the middle
[25:33] or come on from I go to a lamb we know a
[25:38] lot of people who looked really don't
[25:39] believe that but that's the whole
[25:41] principle of the message that's the
[25:42] whole principle of the Gospels I godkin
[25:45] God can insert himself by a word the
[25:47] word have gone a shopping ensure a
[25:48] soldier shy because his nature inside of
[25:51] you by his word slicing and dicing and
[25:53] cutting everything off and ain't
[25:54] supposed to be there and I believe it
[25:57] that's that's the mob my whole Christian
[26:00] experience is based upon i once was lost
[26:03] but now I'm found I once had a horrible
[26:05] nature and now he's put his nature
[26:12] now see I've been I've been reaping I
[26:15] really wasn't rational amount like two
[26:18] or three times me and and that's what
[26:21] the whole focus of this reflected is the
[26:23] lesson is this more than what attracts
[26:25] what attracts to do the devil is
[26:27] attracted by God fulfilling his word
[26:29] it's God making a history are fulfilling
[26:32] prophecy now the thing is a cosmic and
[26:34] history for the prophecy today right now
[26:36] even though you might not see it that
[26:38] always causes an attraction what's on
[26:41] the power of prophecy is being fulfilled
[26:43] Jesus came to over the Mount of Olives
[26:45] and all the people rain seeing that the
[26:49] doves and ravens and the goats and the
[26:51] Lambs and everybody came but the dogs
[26:53] and the Lambs were really interested and
[26:56] following all the way through seeing
[26:59] what God what God was going to be with
[27:02] this little man that everybody thought
[27:03] was just riding on a donkey I add this
[27:08] is description that we got all playing
[27:10] with I am The Living bread which came
[27:11] down from heaven and here he said the
[27:14] words that I spree this wind up I'm
[27:18] running out of time again oh goodness
[27:21] when I went when you know Jesus began to
[27:26] tell the disciples and said to eat my
[27:27] flesh and drink my blood and they got
[27:29] all feed it is because they can't
[27:30] understand said it's the spirit that
[27:32] quickeneth the flesh profit nothing the
[27:34] words that i speak unto you they are
[27:36] spirit and they are alive and that's
[27:38] what a Christian lives by is buying word
[27:45] it should come to pass in that well I
[27:49] might as well go ahead and stop right
[27:51] now he's been getting some something
[27:55] twisted thanks but I think I'll see you
[27:57] around
