[7:50] he uh he's reaching out he's wanting to
[7:53] cross over he sees his mother he sees
[7:55] his family on the other side
[7:58] so we got to singing
[8:00] and he hadn't said a lot in a couple
[8:01] hours and we were singing and I just
[8:04] kept singing for two three hours and he
[8:06] started shouting Hallelujah
[8:08] Hallelujah but it's my prayer that
[8:12] the Lord have his will
[8:14] because he suffered amen and lift up
[8:18] brother Dale also amen
[8:34] yes Turn the Lights
[8:37] how about now
[8:39] our minds and our thoughts are different
[8:41] with the family there at the hospital
[8:42] trying to get situated
[8:45] so listen as we turn to Revelation
[8:47] chapter 5 let's let's uh remember them
[8:50] in prayer I know brother Ryan's already
[8:52] prayed for him but let's do it
[8:54] well great God we're so grateful to be
[8:55] able to gather together tonight with
[8:57] Jesus around your word Lord Jesus and
[8:59] Lord we we're so great glad Lord that
[9:01] you you've given us a sacrifice you've
[9:03] given us an atonement little God that we
[9:05] can that everything every Redemptive
[9:06] blessing is laying there in that
[9:08] atonement
[9:09] tonight Lord Jesus we just claim your
[9:11] blood Lord Jesus and lay all of your
[9:13] promises Lord At Your Feet that will
[9:15] remind you of the things that you've
[9:17] said unto us Lord
[9:18] we ask the Lord to just move upon the
[9:20] scene for them there they're in the
[9:22] hospital Lord and find them a room Lord
[9:24] and just lay the path out clear Lord
[9:26] just everything will work out exactly
[9:27] the way you should Lord Jesus you'll be
[9:30] with them Lord and give them a special
[9:31] blessing
[9:33] give us a special blessing here tonight
[9:34] Lord Jesus as we look into your word
[9:36] Lord Jesus said as we study these things
[9:38] out with God as we lord as we speak
[9:40] these things Lord God surely Lord we
[9:42] lord we would we would be lacking
[9:45] something without you to move Among Us
[9:46] Lord Jesus without your spirit to
[9:48] Quicken these words to us Lord Jesus and
[9:51] we just ask the Lord God that you'll
[9:52] just bless it now to us Lord and this
[9:54] little place Lord Jesus we we're
[9:56] reminded of your promises Lord but you
[9:57] said where the twos and the threes are
[9:59] gathered together in your name that you
[10:01] would be there in our midst so Lord
[10:03] surely we know that tonight Lord you're
[10:05] in our midst as we look into your word
[10:07] Lord Jesus
[10:09] we have confidence Lord Jesus with all
[10:11] the promises that you gave to us we have
[10:14] confidence in what you did first Lord
[10:15] Jesus and we have confidence in what
[10:17] you're doing now Lord by the by the
[10:20] power of the holy ghost moving in our
[10:22] lives and moving in our midst Lord Jesus
[10:23] we just ask your blessing upon these
[10:25] things now in your name
[10:27] amen
[10:30] now I was I was kind of thinking what to
[10:33] what to talk about tonight maybe this
[10:35] maybe this will be just a little a
[10:37] little brief lesson and but I was I was
[10:39] thinking about um
[10:40] I certainly enjoyed brother Andrew's
[10:42] message on Sunday and and I maybe just
[10:45] really want to continue that thought I
[10:47] think there's a short
[10:56] all right okay
[10:58] okay sounds good that'll do it thank you
[11:03] so uh just want to continue uh what
[11:06] brother maybe uh the kind of thought
[11:08] that brother brother Andrew was bringing
[11:09] out on Sunday Sunday morning and just
[11:13] speak to you this morning at the topic
[11:14] we have a lamb and read from Revelation
[11:16] chapter five uh now tonight aren't you
[11:19] glad that we've got a lamb yeah uh we've
[11:22] got a lamb that that died for us that
[11:24] that paid the price for us when we
[11:27] weren't worthy when we couldn't do it
[11:29] we've got a lamb that we can look to
[11:31] that's right so in Revelation chapter 5
[11:33] verse 1 it says and I saw on the right
[11:35] hand of him that said on the throne a
[11:37] book written within and on the backside
[11:39] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[11:42] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[11:43] voice who was worthy to open up the book
[11:45] and to loose the seals thereof
[11:47] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth and
[11:49] neither under the Earth was able to open
[11:51] the book neither to look their own
[11:54] and I went much because no man was found
[11:56] worthy to open and to read the book
[11:58] neither to look their own and one of the
[12:00] elders saith unto me wheat not Behold
[12:02] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the woman
[12:05] of David
[12:06] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[12:09] loose the Seven Seals thereof
[12:11] he may be seated the Lord has blessing
[12:13] to the reading of the word
[12:14] now you really you think about what a
[12:17] Sublime scripture that is that there's
[12:20] nobody worthy to open up the book oh you
[12:23] think about really what that means now
[12:24] when you think about it now that if that
[12:26] if if you can read
[12:28] the Bible
[12:30] and understand it and if you can read
[12:32] and understand as we're supposed to be
[12:34] able to do in this day the Seven Seals
[12:37] and understand all these deep Mysteries
[12:40] then that proves that something
[12:42] spiritual has happened it's something
[12:44] supernatural has happened
[12:46] and maybe we'll just take our time this
[12:48] morning and just talk to you Revelation
[12:50] as we were studying these things out the
[12:53] last few times that I preached from
[12:55] revelation of chapter four
[12:57] in Revelation chapter two and three
[13:00] uh John John saw uh he's looking at all
[13:04] the the church ages laid out and then in
[13:06] Revelation chapter four he got he hears
[13:08] that voice calling them up and he sees
[13:10] the that that uh that scene laid out in
[13:13] front of him one sat on the throne one
[13:16] sitting on the throne and he's seeing a
[13:18] a a of the vision of one sitting there
[13:20] on the throne and then in Revelation
[13:22] chapter five you see the lamb come forth
[13:24] from the throne and and take that book
[13:27] and and and here we're reading this uh
[13:29] as we read these scriptures it's talking
[13:31] about it's asking the question the
[13:33] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[13:35] voice who is worthy who is worthy to
[13:39] open up the book and brother Brown will
[13:41] say now you speak about unworthiness
[13:44] that there's not anybody on Earth that's
[13:47] worthy to open up that book and even or
[13:49] even look at it not even worthy to look
[13:51] at it now he said you speak about
[13:54] unworthiness not even worthy to look at
[13:56] it no man
[13:58] nowhere
[14:00] no man nowhere that you could find
[14:02] anywhere that's worthy to look at that
[14:04] book
[14:05] so if if you want to understand it some
[14:07] something's got to happen right
[14:09] something's got to happen something's
[14:10] got to take place for you to be able to
[14:12] look at these things for you because
[14:13] somebody's going to be able to
[14:15] understand it right somebody's going to
[14:17] be able to understand these things
[14:19] and brother Ann will say if there's no
[14:21] one that is worthy how can we ever hope
[14:23] to see what is written in this book now
[14:26] you see what a Sublime thing this is
[14:28] that's laid out for us that John was
[14:30] concerned you know you look across the
[14:32] land today and it seems like there's not
[14:34] really that many people that are
[14:35] concerned anymore I think John could we
[14:38] could learn a lot from John that he was
[14:39] he was really concerned oh he began to
[14:42] look and see that there was no man
[14:44] worthy to open up that book and he began
[14:46] to grieve and began to cry and begin to
[14:48] weep that no man was open worthy to open
[14:51] up that book and you think you know
[14:53] brother Branham and even brother Dale
[14:55] when he preached the seals and things it
[14:58] would kind of belabor the point that
[14:59] what John had to walk with Jesus John
[15:03] had been there on the day of Pentecost
[15:05] he knew he was born again
[15:08] why would he weep like that now you
[15:10] think about that all these things that
[15:12] are laying there in the scripture that
[15:13] that John knew that there was something
[15:15] special tied in tied in with the opening
[15:18] of the seals that they had to be open
[15:19] now think think this morning
[15:22] think why the seals have to be open
[15:24] we've got all these we've got all these
[15:27] uh loved ones that have gone on can you
[15:30] all hear me okay
[15:31] all right
[15:33] no just I see some weird looks I just
[15:36] want to make sure you can you can
[15:37] understand
[15:38] [Laughter]
[15:41] what was I saying
[15:44] we've got many loved ones and things
[15:46] that have have passed on and going
[15:48] beyond the grave and and if something
[15:50] doesn't happen then if oh you look
[15:53] around the world and you see all the uh
[15:55] the garbage heaps that are piled up and
[15:57] all the uh the trash that's going into
[15:59] the ocean and the filth is uh all all in
[16:02] all the cities all around if something
[16:03] doesn't happen then there's got to be
[16:06] something happen to clean off the Earth
[16:08] there's got to be something to happen to
[16:10] bring the dead Saints from the ground
[16:12] there's got to be something happening in
[16:13] in the lives of you and I to give us
[16:16] confidence that we are going to go in
[16:19] the rapture
[16:20] give us confidence to give us a place
[16:23] where we can really stand and tell the
[16:26] devil boo to know that the devil is
[16:28] nothing but a bluff to see the end of
[16:31] iniquity and all these things to really
[16:33] see the path that God has taken us on to
[16:36] bring us to a place
[16:38] where where these things can be opened
[16:41] to us and we can have an understanding
[16:43] now brother Brandon would say and he's
[16:45] he'd say in the breach between the seven
[16:47] Church ages and the Seven Seals he say
[16:49] you know envisions you cannot reveal
[16:52] things until you are permitted to reveal
[16:54] them
[16:55] now now let's just let's just meditate
[16:57] on that now there Comes A Time
[17:00] there comes an old all down through the
[17:03] history people have probe and really
[17:04] wanted to see these things but it just
[17:06] wasn't time yet
[17:08] but then there Comes A Time
[17:10] a time after after oh you think maybe uh
[17:13] like the church has been moving like the
[17:15] when Ezekiel Saw the four cherubims with
[17:18] the wheel in the middle of the wheel
[17:19] rolling and that brother brother Adam
[17:21] said that was them traveling traveling
[17:23] on a journey but there Comes A Time
[17:25] at the end of the journey when the thing
[17:28] the thing that's in the boxcar can be
[17:30] revealed what's really in the boxcar
[17:32] what's been sealed in there after the
[17:35] travel after the journey and see what
[17:37] brother round is saying here he said the
[17:38] breach between the seven churches and
[17:40] Seven Seals he said you know in Visions
[17:42] you cannot reveal things until you are
[17:44] permitted to reveal them how many times
[17:47] have you all heard me say go into a
[17:49] house perhaps a hat be laid here and
[17:51] this certain child or so forth will not
[17:54] be healed until that is laid over here I
[17:57] cannot tell them or neither can I move
[17:59] it there it's got to be moved in some
[18:01] other way somebody else has to take it
[18:04] and move it and everything in order then
[18:07] it can be revealed
[18:10] I see everything's got to be in order
[18:11] that's why you know sometimes it
[18:13] perplexes us in our mind when we see
[18:15] what we know that our mature Christians
[18:17] that have come to a place and yet there
[18:19] looks like they're going down in their
[18:21] body and and maybe maybe the Lord will
[18:24] take them off to say oh wait think about
[18:25] brother Branham we know he we know he
[18:27] came to adoption that's what we believe
[18:29] and and they were standing there at his
[18:30] grave watching him be lowered his casket
[18:32] lowered in the ground and you wonder
[18:34] well how could this be
[18:36] a man that came to maturity adoption
[18:38] well come on now let's catch it we've
[18:41] all got to come all of the Bride got to
[18:44] come to that place of maturity adoption
[18:46] we've all got to come to that place oh
[18:49] and then we all come to that place then
[18:52] something's going to happen
[18:54] so let's don't get discouraged whenever
[18:57] you look around and you know I was
[18:58] thinking about brother Perry green uh
[19:00] telling about uh how discouraged it
[19:03] seemed like everybody was when they were
[19:04] watching brother Branham it looked like
[19:06] everything was over think about the
[19:08] disciples when it looked like everything
[19:10] was over when when they lowered put
[19:12] Jesus in that grave and rolled the tomb
[19:14] over it oh but that wasn't the end of
[19:16] the story
[19:17] that wasn't the end of the story why why
[19:19] do I know that it's not the end of the
[19:21] story because we got a lamp
[19:23] we got a lamb they can open up the book
[19:27] and it's not based on our worthiness
[19:29] it's not our worthiness that we're
[19:31] standing here that we're coming to
[19:32] church tonight but it's his worthiness
[19:34] he is the one that has made us Worthy
[19:37] now you you see there's somebody he said
[19:40] somebody else has to take it into a
[19:42] little hat and move it and everything in
[19:43] order then it can be revealed like that
[19:45] time that brother Branham was in that uh
[19:47] that little sister's house that he went
[19:49] to pray for early on in his ministry and
[19:51] he he he he goofed up
[19:54] and and and he had to wait for that hat
[19:57] to be placed exactly where it needed to
[19:58] be and see how that's what he's trying
[20:00] to get us everything's got to be in
[20:02] order so let's rate wait like Paul said
[20:05] we're running a race we're running a
[20:07] race let's be patient and wait for
[20:09] things to fall in order I think where
[20:11] we're waiting on we're waiting not
[20:13] waiting on Jesus Christ but we're
[20:15] waiting on one another for us to fall in
[20:18] order for all of the different ones all
[20:20] around the world to fall in place to to
[20:23] get right in position with the world to
[20:26] be in subjection with the word where God
[20:28] has just totally claimed our lives and
[20:30] there's a time there's a time when the
[20:32] thing can be revealed but we got to wait
[20:35] and be patient and keep moving right but
[20:38] when the time comes
[20:40] when the time comes it's time for the
[20:42] revealing
[20:43] now that's why all you think now this is
[20:46] really an encouraging thing to say
[20:47] that's why we come to church because
[20:49] we're wanting Revelation that's why we
[20:52] come to church that's why we through
[20:54] life we put up with things that's why we
[20:57] we deal with things we deal with one
[20:58] another we deal with fake people at work
[21:00] and different things we're we're there's
[21:02] a goal in front of us that we're trying
[21:04] to achieve that's why we press on that's
[21:06] why we don't back down or turn around
[21:08] that's why we keep moving forward like
[21:11] Paul encouraged Us in the book of
[21:13] Hebrews you keep moving forward toward
[21:15] the mark of the high calling in Christ
[21:17] and don't give up and don't back down
[21:20] and let's be zealous like John was when
[21:23] he began to see you there's somebody's
[21:25] how could somebody's got to be able to
[21:27] open up this book I need somebody that's
[21:29] worthy I think maybe tonight that's what
[21:31] our hearts should be crying out for I I
[21:33] need a lamb and if you need a lamb
[21:36] you've come to the right place because
[21:39] this is where we talk about a lamb we
[21:41] talk about the lamb that was shed for us
[21:43] once for all and there's a promise
[21:46] laying in the Bible that the time will
[21:49] come for the lamb to take the book
[21:52] the time will come for that lamb to take
[21:54] the book now you see we're not waiting
[21:56] now we're not waiting for a date on the
[21:58] calendar as the years go roll by and the
[22:00] months Roll by it seems like the older
[22:03] you get the faster the years Roll by it
[22:05] seems like it just gets faster and
[22:07] faster doesn't it we're already at the
[22:09] end of this year but we're not waiting
[22:11] for a date on the calendar we're waiting
[22:13] what are we waiting on he said we're not
[22:16] waiting on Jesus where God is waiting on
[22:18] us we're waiting on growth maturity so
[22:22] that's what I'm talking about tonight
[22:24] when when these things are opened up to
[22:27] you it is a sign that something is
[22:30] taking place in the church it's
[22:32] something that's taken place in the
[22:34] bride something takes it's supernatural
[22:37] has taken place in your character in
[22:39] your life now that's what I'm talking
[22:41] about tonight that God you come to a
[22:44] place where God is confident with your
[22:46] character that he's confident with what
[22:48] he sees in you that you've been
[22:50] inspected like that boxcar that's got to
[22:52] be inspected it's got to be inspected
[22:55] before it can be sealed up your
[22:57] character your Revelation grows and
[22:59] grows precept upon precept line up
[23:02] online here a little there a little
[23:03] until God has confidence in you oh think
[23:06] this this afternoon we're not here this
[23:09] afternoon just to for personalities to
[23:11] to see one another we're not here in
[23:13] this building for for religious order to
[23:16] see stained glass windows or something
[23:17] we're not here for Comfort or for wealth
[23:20] we're not here for plus season tailored
[23:22] worship and coffee coffee pots and big
[23:25] names and buildings but what we've
[23:27] gathered here this afternoon for is for
[23:29] revelation
[23:30] that is the most important thing in the
[23:34] life of any Christian any born-again
[23:36] Christian that's really that's really
[23:38] you oh you come to a place where that's
[23:40] all you want is a revelation oh that was
[23:44] what John wanted when he saw that there
[23:46] was no man worthy to open up that book
[23:48] that's what he wanted he wanted to look
[23:50] at that book he wanted to see what that
[23:52] book said because that book had
[23:54] something to say about his Redemption it
[23:57] had something to say about himself and I
[24:00] tell you what it had to say it had
[24:01] something to say about his Lord and
[24:03] Savior the only one that can open up
[24:05] that book was the one that wrote it oh
[24:09] you see if you can read that book that
[24:11] shows that something has happened to you
[24:13] that you've got a relationship with the
[24:15] one that wrote it and the only one that
[24:18] corroded has revealed it to you and the
[24:21] revelation of Jesus Christ he said
[24:22] brother and said oh how we need
[24:24] Revelation by the spirit
[24:27] we don't need a new Bible we don't need
[24:31] a new translation
[24:32] though some are very good and I am not
[24:36] against them
[24:37] but we need the revelation of the spirit
[24:41] and he said and thank God we can have
[24:43] what we need for God wants to reveal his
[24:47] word to us by his spirit
[24:49] now that should encourage us all tonight
[24:51] to know that maybe if we're in a place
[24:54] where we don't see things clearly if we
[24:56] don't see that like we're looking
[24:58] through a lattice like Solomon talked
[25:00] and we and it's like we things aren't
[25:01] quiet in perspective yet that there's a
[25:04] promise here that God wants to reveal
[25:06] his word to us now now you go back and
[25:10] you listen to how brother brother Dale
[25:11] used to preach these things and he would
[25:14] compare he would compare your adoption
[25:16] time when when you were first seeking
[25:19] the new birth you didn't come haphazard
[25:22] and say well I'm just going to it's got
[25:24] to be my way or the highway but you come
[25:27] groaning and grieving and on your knees
[25:30] and standing praying at night and pacing
[25:33] back and forth and listening to this
[25:35] preacher and listening to that preacher
[25:37] and you didn't just come haphazard but
[25:39] you were after something and you're not
[25:42] going to come to a place of adoption on
[25:44] just some kind of haphazard it's going
[25:46] to be something within you crawling and
[25:48] it's something our children something
[25:50] won't God more of God is something where
[25:54] you you've got to have more of God like
[25:56] John looking at this place I need it I
[25:59] need God you you think you're going to
[26:02] come to a place of adoption just kind of
[26:04] haphazard going into church and sitting
[26:06] there and just falling asleep all the
[26:08] time and that will produce nothing but
[26:11] you've got to come sincerely sincerely
[26:14] wanted something from God and expecting
[26:17] that God will reward you oh it's the
[26:19] hour for that my freaking it's the hour
[26:21] where God wants to see it sincere
[26:24] zealous Hearts somebody that's labor and
[26:27] crying in the middle of the hour
[26:29] somebody that knows that God is able to
[26:32] reveal it
[26:34] and brother Adam said this seven sealed
[26:36] book is revealed at the time of the
[26:38] seven thunders of Revelation 10.
[26:40] he said in Isaiah chapter 40 he said
[26:43] they that wait upon the Lord
[26:46] shall renew their strength for they
[26:48] shall Mount up with wings as eagles they
[26:51] shall run and not be weary and they
[26:53] shall walk and not faint who those that
[26:55] wait
[26:56] upon the Lord because this seven sealer
[27:00] book is revealed at the time of the
[27:03] seven thunders of Revelation 10.
[27:06] so the church has been waiting for that
[27:09] time now I believe I believe the time is
[27:12] here just generally for the bride but I
[27:15] believe that time is for here for for
[27:16] you specifically those of you that have
[27:19] been labored in the message for years
[27:21] and decades oh surely surely the word is
[27:24] continue to be opened up to you the word
[27:27] has been building and building and you
[27:28] see oh you see God has put a place a
[27:33] promise in the word where maybe you've
[27:34] wondered for years and years if exactly
[27:37] where you are in the scripture but
[27:39] there's a promise here in the Bible that
[27:41] when these things open up to you oh
[27:42] that'll that will give you confidence
[27:46] you see that's that's why we're pressing
[27:48] on toward the seven seal the Seven Seals
[27:51] must be open to the bride in this day
[27:54] because that will give you confidence
[27:57] that you know where you stand with God
[28:00] that you know that you have been born
[28:03] again and something that's taken place
[28:06] in your life and you know that oh I'll
[28:09] say I'll Echo the words of brother Dale
[28:11] from years ago when when the Seven Seals
[28:14] are really open to you you will know
[28:17] that you are not going to die that's why
[28:21] the seals must be open to you and we're
[28:24] speaking this afternoon about a book
[28:26] that is promised to be opened it is
[28:28] promised to be open We've Got This
[28:30] Promise laying here that this book can
[28:33] be open and we'll be open to the bride
[28:35] in the in the in the end times
[28:37] it was open in Revelation 10. in
[28:40] Revelation 10 it says I saw another
[28:42] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[28:44] clothed with a cloud
[28:46] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[28:49] face was as it were the son and his feet
[28:51] his pillars of Fire
[28:53] and he had in his little hand in his
[28:55] hand
[28:56] a little book open
[28:58] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[29:00] and his left foot on the Earth
[29:03] now here in one place in Revelation 5 it
[29:06] was closed here and sealed but here in
[29:09] Revelation 10 it's open it's been opened
[29:14] and he said since that time of the
[29:15] ceiling we're getting into tonight now
[29:18] the book's open
[29:20] now really what we're talking about
[29:21] tonight
[29:22] how did it open If no man was Worthy
[29:27] how did it open If no man was worthy
[29:30] because you got it before you can look
[29:32] at it before you can understand it you
[29:35] got to understand how
[29:37] did it open
[29:39] how is it going to open up to you
[29:42] how did it open
[29:44] brother Adam said well if we read in
[29:46] Revelation 2 chapter 10 if we just keep
[29:48] reading I'm just going to read some
[29:49] scripture here and just walk through the
[29:51] scripture
[29:52] he had in his hand the little book open
[29:54] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[29:57] and his left foot upon the Earth and he
[30:00] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[30:03] roarth and when he had cried seven
[30:05] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[30:08] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[30:09] voices I was about to write and I Heard
[30:12] a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[30:15] up those things which the seven Thunders
[30:17] uttered and write them not
[30:19] now he brother Brown would say now
[30:21] that's what we don't know
[30:23] that's yet to be revealed it's not in
[30:25] holy script what them Thunders say when
[30:28] he was preaching it he said we don't
[30:30] know what he preached the preach sermon
[30:34] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[30:37] sea and upon the Earth lifted up His
[30:39] Hands to Heaven
[30:40] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[30:43] ever who created the heavens and the
[30:46] things that therein are and the earth
[30:48] and the things therein are and there
[30:51] should be time no longer watch here's a
[30:52] verse I want to get to brother Adam said
[30:54] within the day of the voice of the
[30:57] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[30:59] sound the mystery of God should be
[31:01] finished as he gets declared to his
[31:03] servants the prophet
[31:05] now it says when he shall begin to sound
[31:09] now brother Brown preached we believe
[31:11] that he is the seventh angel that he's
[31:13] talking about he preached and he
[31:14] preached and he preached but the seven
[31:16] of the seals will not open up at the
[31:18] beginning of his ministry they were
[31:20] opened up at the end when he began to
[31:22] preach and to fulfill what God has
[31:24] commissioned Malachi 456 that his
[31:27] message would turn the hearts of the
[31:29] children back to the original faith of
[31:31] the Pentecostal fathers when he should
[31:33] begin to sound now when he shall begin
[31:35] to sound means when his ministry his
[31:38] message begin to sound not when he
[31:40] started to preach but when his message
[31:42] began to sound the mystery of the seven
[31:44] seal book will be revealed of the
[31:46] sounding of the seven Church Angels
[31:48] message not the brother around would say
[31:50] not the years in preparation not them
[31:52] those years back in the beginning when
[31:54] he was he didn't really understand
[31:56] things not when he was just a little
[31:58] baby we'll say not the years in
[32:00] preparation but when he begins to sound
[32:02] the message when he begins to sound the
[32:04] message what didn't occur at the
[32:06] beginning of his life but at the end
[32:08] there at the beginning of that last
[32:10] three and a half years when he begins to
[32:12] sound the message these Mysteries then
[32:14] will be revealed the seventh angel
[32:16] begins to sound and there's the messages
[32:18] wrote out there and we got it and tape
[32:21] and book form now if the message if the
[32:23] Seven Seals were revealed there at the
[32:25] end of his life
[32:27] at the culmination of his life the
[32:31] crowning of his life
[32:32] what about the crowning of your life
[32:35] not the end of your life like that right
[32:38] before you go down in the grave or
[32:39] something like that every problem you go
[32:42] back through every promise in the Bible
[32:43] right there after Abraham walked with
[32:46] God for 25 years and hung on and there
[32:48] there at the end something happened he
[32:50] he met Melchizedek and and Melchizedek
[32:54] lingered with him and began to open up
[32:56] these things and showed him all these
[32:58] promises oh you follow every promise in
[33:00] the Bibles there oh David David was
[33:03] anointed by Samuel there at the
[33:04] beginning but there at the end he went
[33:06] through three anointings he was anointed
[33:08] by the tribe of Judah and there anointed
[33:11] by all of Israel there at the end
[33:12] something happened there at the end
[33:14] something happens there at the end what
[33:16] what end are you talking about I'm
[33:18] talking about your adoption adoption
[33:21] time when you grow and grow and there at
[33:23] the end God opens up something special
[33:25] to you not at the beginning of his
[33:27] ministry was it opened up but at the
[33:29] conclusion
[33:30] oh what was open up to him The Complete
[33:33] Book of redemption what was up so that
[33:36] you so that he could preach it to you
[33:37] and I and you and I could see what he
[33:40] saw
[33:41] what is this book of redemption that
[33:43] we're talking about tonight
[33:45] brother I'm going to say Jesus Christ
[33:47] the son of God is the book of redemption
[33:49] he was the word and he is the word and
[33:52] that's bound to be him you see so this
[33:54] is the whole book of redemption which is
[33:57] Jesus Christ fitly put together by God
[34:00] with the promises of redemption and
[34:02] healing and everything for the human
[34:04] being
[34:05] that's why Revelation is the most
[34:08] important thing to a Christian
[34:10] because Revelation reveals Jesus Christ
[34:12] it's all about Jesus Christ when you
[34:16] read the Bible you see more of Jesus
[34:17] Christ that's the evidence of the new
[34:19] birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[34:21] when you as you walk you see more and
[34:24] more of him and that gives you
[34:25] confidence as you as the word is
[34:28] revealed to you it transforms your life
[34:32] it changes your character and as the
[34:35] word is revealed to you and it opens up
[34:37] to you it's actually claiming your life
[34:39] as the word is revealed it's opening up
[34:42] more and more to you of who Jesus Christ
[34:44] is that's what brother Brown said the
[34:46] new birth he said what is the new birth
[34:48] then you'd say well brother Branham what
[34:50] is the new birth it is the revelation of
[34:52] Jesus Christ personally to you see not
[34:55] you joined a church you shook a hand
[34:57] you've done something different you said
[35:00] a Creed you promised to live by a code
[35:02] of rules but Christ the Bible
[35:05] he is the word that was revealed to you
[35:08] and no matter what anybody else says
[35:10] what takes place it's Christ Pastor
[35:14] priest whatever it might be it's Christ
[35:18] in you that is the Revelation that the
[35:21] church was built on
[35:23] oh where is this in the Bible brother
[35:25] Bob in Hebrews 11 1. it says faith is
[35:29] the substance of things hoped for
[35:32] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[35:35] I I think this afternoon maybe if that
[35:37] confuses you a little bit we can take
[35:39] Faith and swap it for revelation we
[35:41] could take Revelation and swap it for
[35:43] faith faith is a revelation Revelation
[35:46] is Faith and those two things are really
[35:49] the same thing so if you've got faith is
[35:52] because God has revealed something to
[35:54] you and what did he reveal to you he
[35:57] revealed himself to you when you need
[36:00] healing he reveals that he is a Healer
[36:02] and that you've got the thing that you
[36:04] were hoping for and now you've got it
[36:06] because it's revealed to you you and
[36:08] that becomes a substance it is a
[36:11] substance because it's a revelation of
[36:13] Jesus Christ personally to you you see
[36:16] him when you read the Bible is
[36:18] transformed be caught Beyond just
[36:20] something that's in your hand some head
[36:22] knowledge and now it's in your heart and
[36:24] you know it because he's shown it to you
[36:27] that's what I'm talking about when I'm
[36:28] preaching about the Seven Seals when God
[36:31] reveals it to you you've got it it's
[36:33] something that passes beyond all hopes
[36:35] oh that's you say well brother Bob what
[36:37] is the difference between Hope and Faith
[36:39] Faith is not something you're just
[36:41] looking for faith is when God reveals it
[36:44] to you and you've got the thing that you
[36:46] were hoping for because God has revealed
[36:49] it to you that's what Jesus said in John
[36:52] chapter 5 verily verily I say unto you
[36:55] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[36:58] him that sent me has the everlasting
[37:00] life he that believeth he that
[37:02] understandeth when God reveals it to you
[37:05] and you understand because God is
[37:07] personally shown it to you the author of
[37:10] The Bible has revealed it to you and
[37:11] shown a big old flashlight on it then
[37:14] you you know that it's true then oh
[37:17] that's the evidence that you have passed
[37:18] from Death unto eternal life so that's
[37:21] why Romans chapter 10 says faith cometh
[37:23] by hearing now listen to the way this is
[37:26] worded Faith cometh by hearing and
[37:30] hearing by the word of God
[37:33] that you can sit there in church every
[37:35] day of your life and hear the the word
[37:38] will be preached but unless you hear it
[37:40] it will never bring Faith
[37:44] so the question is do you hear what the
[37:46] spirit is saying to the churches you'll
[37:49] never be able to hear without that lamb
[37:51] that I'm talking about you'll never be
[37:54] able to hear without an atonement
[37:55] applied to your life where you have
[37:57] accepted what Jesus Christ did for you
[38:00] and accepted it and believed it and had
[38:03] it applied to your life like they did
[38:05] there in Egypt where they applied the
[38:07] blood over the little of their door and
[38:09] they believed what God had done
[38:12] Faith cometh by hearing
[38:15] can you hear can you hear oh when you
[38:18] when you hear the preaching of the
[38:20] Gospel does it excite you or does it
[38:22] bore you when you hear the preaching of
[38:25] the word do you really can you hear
[38:27] between the letter between the lines do
[38:30] you hear God actually speaking to you
[38:32] and opening it up to you do you hear
[38:35] what the spirit is saying to you can you
[38:37] hear because if you can hear oh if you
[38:40] can read the Bible in a different way
[38:42] read it by the lens of the Holy Ghost
[38:44] then you read different than the whole
[38:47] rest of the world can read because
[38:49] you've got an ear you've got an eyesight
[38:51] you've got that the veil has been pulled
[38:53] away from your eyes where you can read
[38:55] you're reading it different Revelation
[38:58] chapter 3 the promise to the laodicean
[39:00] church he that hath in the ear let him
[39:02] hear what the spirits saith unto the
[39:04] churches
[39:06] promise to all the church ages
[39:09] he that hath an ear because if you can
[39:12] hear
[39:13] if you can hear that will produce faith
[39:17] this book will be understood at the end
[39:20] brother remember said this book of
[39:21] redemption will not be thoroughly
[39:23] understood it's probed that through six
[39:25] Church ages but at the end
[39:28] at the end
[39:29] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[39:31] his mystery who winds up all of the
[39:35] Loose Ends that these fellows probe that
[39:37] and the Mysteries comes down from God as
[39:39] the word of God and reveals the entire
[39:42] revelation of God
[39:45] oh look at this pattern at the end at
[39:48] the end when every mystery is finished
[39:50] when every mystery is finished in the
[39:53] church Ages Every loose end is tied up
[39:56] when every mystery is tied up in your
[40:00] life when all the loose ends are tied up
[40:03] all the things that you wondered about
[40:06] is it a trinity is is there such a thing
[40:09] as eternal hell how do we be how do we
[40:12] how should we be baptized when all these
[40:15] things are tied up all the Loose Ends
[40:18] the book of redemption will be
[40:19] understood
[40:21] I'm talking about understanding tonight
[40:24] because an eagle
[40:25] will understand
[40:27] oh you realize that promise you you got
[40:30] to be like that eagle that looked down
[40:32] at that little squirrel just to chatter
[40:33] in a way the days of Miracles are passed
[40:36] the days of Miracles are passed like
[40:37] brother Ram said and what does an eagle
[40:39] do what's an eagle's response to that
[40:42] I don't care
[40:44] I don't care what you say and the ego oh
[40:47] you can you go through all the life of
[40:49] all the the bullies and all the picking
[40:51] and all the different things people
[40:53] saying well you're prideful people
[40:54] saying this and that people making fun
[40:57] people saying well I don't think you got
[40:59] the Holy Ghost I don't think you really
[41:00] believe the truth I don't think that you
[41:03] really have to dress the way that you
[41:04] dress I don't think that this and that
[41:06] and all those things oh but God's
[41:08] bringing us to a place of perfect rest
[41:11] and peace in him why where does it come
[41:13] from from Revelation revelation
[41:16] brother Adam said we see that this seven
[41:18] sealed book now is the mystery of
[41:20] redemption it's a book of redemption
[41:22] from God he said the Seven Seals holds
[41:25] the mystery of the book until we can see
[41:27] what those Seven Seals has sealed in
[41:29] we're only presuming them things
[41:32] we are sure to miss the thing unless
[41:35] unless it is absolutely genuinely
[41:38] revealed by the Holy Spirit and
[41:41] Vindicated the same
[41:43] so what we can understand is that we
[41:45] need we need God to understand these
[41:47] things there's no way to understand
[41:49] without God
[41:52] there's no way to understand but if you
[41:55] do understand that see that's the that's
[41:57] the thing
[41:58] God wants us to understand
[42:01] and when the book is opened
[42:03] then you can have confidence that
[42:04] something supernatural has happened
[42:07] we need a lamb
[42:09] the book is completely sealed up brother
[42:11] Andrew said the book is absolutely
[42:13] sealed do you see it the book is
[42:15] absolutely a sealed book until the Seven
[42:17] Seals is broken it is sealed up with
[42:19] Seven Seals what's sealed up what is it
[42:22] all about
[42:23] what is this book about well that's
[42:25] sealed up how does the book open that's
[42:27] sealed up what is redeemed what is the
[42:29] thing that's redeemed is sealed up how
[42:31] is it redeemed it's sealed up what takes
[42:34] place it's sealed up who did the
[42:37] Redeemer how did it work how how did all
[42:40] these things fit together it's all
[42:42] sealed up he said it was closed here in
[42:44] Revelation is the fifth chapter and in
[42:46] Revelation is the 10th chapter it is
[42:48] open
[42:49] and brother Brown said in the message to
[42:52] breach he said now we're going to see
[42:55] what the book says about how it become
[42:58] open
[42:59] now surely that tonight that Peaks our
[43:02] attention wouldn't we like to know how
[43:04] the book became open
[43:05] he said it is not made known until the
[43:08] lamb takes the book and breaks the seals
[43:11] and opens the book see the Lambs got to
[43:15] take the book
[43:16] it's he is
[43:18] the Lambs got to take the book if it's
[43:21] his book and he's the one that wrote it
[43:23] and is sealed up and no man is worthy
[43:26] he's the only one that can take the book
[43:28] The Lambs got to take the book that's
[43:30] why we need to lay them the lamb is the
[43:33] only one that's worthy that's why we got
[43:36] to have a lamb we need the lamb brother
[43:38] I'm going to say we're depending on him
[43:40] and we will see later it is at the end
[43:42] time when time has run out no
[43:45] denomination has a right for the
[43:47] interpretation of the book no man has a
[43:49] right to interpret it that's why when we
[43:52] stand up behind this platform this
[43:53] Podium we don't come with our own ideas
[43:55] we're coming straight to preach the word
[43:58] not our own ideas and our opinions our
[44:00] our politics and some grievance that we
[44:03] have some petty grievance against
[44:04] somebody in the church or some idea that
[44:06] we have but we're coming to preach the
[44:08] word of God that because why would come
[44:11] for Revelation you know that's what
[44:14] draws people to church is revelation
[44:16] that's why we've come here is revelation
[44:19] it is the Lamb who interprets it and the
[44:21] lamb is the one who speaks it and the
[44:24] lamb makes the word to be known by
[44:26] vindicating and bringing the word to
[44:28] life
[44:29] but in the last stage all these
[44:32] Mysteries are to be solved and handed
[44:34] out now that's a pretty big promise that
[44:37] all the Mysteries are to be solved and
[44:40] handed out and the seals are to be
[44:43] opened by the lamb and revealed to the
[44:45] church
[44:46] and then time is no more
[44:49] what what is a seal anyway a seal when
[44:53] you seal up a letter it shows where it
[44:55] came from a seal shows ownership a
[44:58] shield oh oh when you're sealed by the
[45:00] Holy Ghost it shows that you are gods
[45:03] ownership that in Ephesians chapter 1 it
[45:06] says and whom you also trusted after
[45:08] that you heard the word of Truth The
[45:10] Gospel of your salvation and whom also
[45:13] after that ye believed you were sealed
[45:15] with that Holy Spirit of promise and
[45:18] that proves that God has done something
[45:20] in your life he's cut off all your sins
[45:22] he's he's he's forgiven you of all your
[45:25] sins he's cleaned you up and he's sealed
[45:27] you in he sealed your soul to show that
[45:29] your soul the Redemption process of your
[45:31] soul is finished it's done and it shows
[45:34] that he's claimed you your soul is his
[45:36] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[45:38] until the Redemption of the purchased
[45:40] possession it's the it's the down
[45:42] payment until everything is accomplished
[45:44] in your life until the Redemption of the
[45:46] whole purchased possession until the
[45:48] praise unto the praise of his glory
[45:51] the holy spirit is a seal and to that
[45:53] individual when he receives the Holy
[45:55] Spirit and his time of groaning is over
[45:58] see because it is the finished work no
[46:02] more groaning when you're sealed oh
[46:04] there's a lot of groaning and crying
[46:06] when you're seeking the baptism of the
[46:07] Holy Ghost but when you're sealed when
[46:10] God seals you in through the baptism of
[46:12] the Holy Ghost all that groaning and
[46:14] striving is done and now you're resting
[46:17] in him you're resting like Ruth did when
[46:19] she was resting Boaz got up and Ruth
[46:22] laid down Boaz got up and went to work
[46:25] and you're just resting and and you're
[46:27] resting in what he did
[46:29] you're resting in the fact that he's the
[46:32] only one that's worthy and you don't
[46:34] have to do anything you're resting like
[46:37] a boxcar that gets sealed up it's still
[46:40] it's inspected it's packed in it's
[46:42] sealed up and it's sealed up to its
[46:44] destination now at the end at the
[46:46] destination
[46:47] they look and see what's on the inside
[46:51] the inspector shuts the door and the
[46:53] inspector places a seal upon it and then
[46:55] nobody can break that seal that boxcar
[46:58] seal until it reaches its destination
[47:01] and brother Brown said that's what the
[47:02] holy spirit's been doing see he goes and
[47:05] he inspects that's the reason you can't
[47:07] have these things and you say I spoke in
[47:09] tongues and I shouted and I danced in
[47:11] the spirit that don't have nothing to do
[47:13] with it see the Holy Spirit inspects
[47:15] that person
[47:17] until he's thoroughly satisfied
[47:21] I knows that they are then they are
[47:22] sealed until their Eternal destination
[47:26] there's not nothing can ever break that
[47:29] seal
[47:30] so what's that seal he's talking about
[47:33] the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit seals
[47:36] you and he says when the seventh seal is
[47:38] broken the mystery of God that sealed in
[47:41] these mysterious seals is finished
[47:44] until the day that seal is broken then
[47:47] it's revealed what's on the inside of it
[47:50] if the man's wondering now listen
[47:53] if the man's wondering what's in that
[47:55] boxcar
[47:56] you say it's supposed to be such and
[48:00] such is supposed to be a real born-again
[48:03] believer that's what it's supposed to be
[48:06] but if you're just presuming he says
[48:09] presuming but when the seal is broken
[48:11] and the door is open we see into it then
[48:15] and see exactly what's in there and
[48:18] that'll only be done at the end time
[48:20] well what a great thing to know what's
[48:22] in that boxcar oh you see why the seals
[48:25] had to be opened up the seals will give
[48:28] you Rapture and Faith the seals have to
[48:31] be opened up to you to the bride for the
[48:34] dead in Christ to rise from the ground
[48:37] oh that's why oh in this hour we are
[48:40] predestinated we are called to preach
[48:43] the Deep things of God it's it's great
[48:46] to go into a camp meeting and and preach
[48:48] you know just kind of nice a good come
[48:50] to Jesus meeting where where people come
[48:53] to the Lord and give their hearts to the
[48:54] Lord but there's going to come a time
[48:56] where the church doors were closed and
[48:59] there won't be any more coming in
[49:02] but the bride will be preaching then to
[49:04] the totally lost
[49:05] and will be coming to a place oh we'll
[49:08] we'll I believe surely by then we'll
[49:11] we'll know where we stand with Christ
[49:14] we'll know
[49:16] this book is sealed and you are sealed
[49:18] with a book until the day of redemption
[49:20] and something that's what we're groaning
[49:22] for that's something in US is groaning
[49:24] and crying for that full Redemption
[49:28] oh
[49:29] brother Ram said I'm gonna uh well I
[49:32] guess we kind of got time
[49:34] in Romans chapter eight he said for we
[49:37] uh Paul said in Romans chapter 8 for we
[49:39] know that the whole creation groanth and
[49:43] travaileth and pain together until now
[49:44] like now like did you notice that was
[49:46] brother Andrew was preaching on Sunday
[49:48] well you're groaning and when a child
[49:50] you're grown something's being delivered
[49:53] now when your deliverance comes then
[49:55] you're happy you can now you can rest
[49:57] you can hold the baby the baby's there
[49:59] but before that your groanings you're
[50:01] grown and what are we travailing for
[50:03] we're travailing to see Christ fully
[50:06] made manifest in us before you're born
[50:09] again and sanctification you're groaning
[50:10] and travailing to see Christ manifested
[50:12] you want to be him see him born in you
[50:15] and now as we grow in Grace and
[50:17] knowledge up that stature of perfect man
[50:19] we're groaning and travailing again
[50:21] going through a higher form of
[50:23] sanctification something is growing in
[50:25] us as the word is being manifested in US
[50:27] pushing out nature but around and said
[50:30] nature is groaning we are groaning
[50:32] everything is groaning because we
[50:33] realize there's something not right
[50:37] oh oh surely we can we can see that
[50:39] we're not right yet there's something
[50:42] not right and the only way oh now listen
[50:45] to this the only way you can groan and
[50:49] wait for it is because there has been
[50:51] New Life coming here that speaks of a
[50:53] new world
[50:55] foreign
[50:56] oh that proves that something
[50:58] supernatural has taken place in you when
[51:00] you are zealous for the word when you
[51:03] want that word oh I remember when I
[51:05] first come to the Lord I'd sit in church
[51:06] meetings and I'd get a headache and the
[51:08] devil would attack me I wanted it was so
[51:11] bad I would sit there and I'm not saying
[51:13] this to be both for myself it's a fact I
[51:16] wanted it I wanted the word and that's
[51:18] how any born-again believer should be
[51:20] you want the word and that's how any
[51:22] preacher should be too you want to
[51:24] preach the word not to stay down in like
[51:26] little pity Patty things but to grow up
[51:28] where you can preach the real that's
[51:31] what I want to do I want to preach some
[51:33] real meat because Eagles want real meat
[51:37] that's what the eagle wants they want
[51:39] some real meat and the meat that I'm
[51:41] talking about is it's adoption time meat
[51:43] me meet what we come and we begin to
[51:45] realize where we are positionally placed
[51:47] where we can realize that the devil
[51:49] don't have any weapons that he's a bluff
[51:51] well we can see the end of our iniquity
[51:54] that we're talking about well we can see
[51:56] with that sword in the hand of that
[51:58] second ride it really symbolizes well we
[52:00] can see what these four beasts really
[52:02] symbolizes now that's the meat that'll
[52:04] give a real bride confidence in where
[52:06] she stands in the hour that she's living
[52:08] here now brother Brown would say you
[52:10] don't groan unless there's a reason for
[52:12] it there's a reason for our grown and he
[52:15] said did you ever notice how a tree
[52:16] struggles for life it wants to live and
[52:19] you notice an animal how and death how
[52:21] it's struggles you notice a human being
[52:24] everything nature is growing we and
[52:26] ourselves are groaning we know that
[52:28] there's something wrong we see from
[52:31] these verses that something has been
[52:32] lost
[52:34] both the man and Earth creation of all
[52:37] time because we're gonna this Earth is
[52:39] going to be redeemed so that we can come
[52:42] and live on it but before this whole
[52:44] earth
[52:45] holy redeemed our Earth is going to be
[52:48] redeemed and that is the mystery that's
[52:50] laying there in that seven seal book he
[52:53] said we know it was eternal life they
[52:55] had fallen from and they lost their
[52:57] claims on eternal life by the fall of
[52:59] Adam and Eve who fell from eternal life
[53:03] I know it's Wednesday night so y'all
[53:06] just listen with your eyes closed it's
[53:07] fine I I don't I really I don't mind
[53:10] just just as long as you listen just
[53:12] listen close your eyes and relax and
[53:14] just listen that's fine
[53:16] a tree he said a tree never died before
[53:19] Adam an animal Wouldn't Die before Adam
[53:21] and there's only one thing that cannot
[53:24] die and that's God because he's eternal
[53:27] and that's the only way we can ever keep
[53:29] from dying we have to have eternal life
[53:31] in us to be Sons and Daughters of God
[53:33] but when we die to sin we sold out our
[53:36] Birthright and crossed this Chasm now
[53:39] we're beyond the reach of God on this
[53:41] other side of the chasm
[53:43] Adam had completely Supreme control of
[53:46] the earth he was a god of the Earth
[53:49] he could speak he could name he could
[53:51] say he could stop nature he could do
[53:53] anything he wanted to see but when he
[53:56] did that when he just took what what the
[53:59] serpent told Eve and listened to his
[54:01] wife when he did that he lost his
[54:03] inheritance now the forfeited title deed
[54:06] is now in the hands of the original
[54:09] owner almighty God now that's that scene
[54:13] that John is looking at in Revelation 4
[54:15] One sat on the throne
[54:17] the title deed to the Earth and to
[54:20] eternal life when Adam forfeited it then
[54:22] Satan's dirty hands could not take it so
[54:25] it went back to which the original owner
[54:28] God himself so God himself has the title
[54:31] deed to your Redemptive rights every
[54:34] Redemptive right that you can have the
[54:36] promise of to be to be what is to be the
[54:39] god of the earth a god a god of the
[54:42] earth like Adam they could speak and the
[54:45] winds would be still to speak in a
[54:46] mountain be moved that's why these
[54:48] promises are laying here in the
[54:50] scripture that if you say to a mountain
[54:52] and don't doubt in your heart why
[54:54] because that is what you were
[54:56] predestinated for from back in the back
[54:58] part of God's mind that's the kind of
[55:00] person that God wanted you to be a
[55:03] faith-filled person that when you speak
[55:05] to a mountain that it obeys you when you
[55:08] speak to the winds and the waves that it
[55:10] obeys you that you could speak by faith
[55:13] and believe that God would stop the rain
[55:15] from falling and it would obey you that
[55:17] you could lay your hands on your wife in
[55:19] the dead of night and pray for her and
[55:21] the sickness would leave that something
[55:24] would happen when you pray because of
[55:26] faith and what is Faith a revelation
[55:29] because God has revealed to you for some
[55:33] aspect of himself
[55:35] brother Ram said there he sits on the
[55:38] throne with it in his hand
[55:40] he sets on the throne with it the title
[55:43] deed he said oh that makes me feel
[55:46] religious friends now you when these
[55:48] things really sink down into your heart
[55:50] that will make that's what will make a
[55:53] Believer cry in the car and Shout in the
[55:57] shower and praise God whether going on a
[55:59] walk in the morning is when God begins
[56:01] to reveal himself to you and open up to
[56:03] you the things that are just laying here
[56:05] on the page oh that's why we need the
[56:08] spirit because the spirit is what gives
[56:10] the essence of the word did you realize
[56:12] even as I'm speaking to you the spirit
[56:14] in which it's conveyed gives it the
[56:16] meaning the spirit is what gives it the
[56:19] essence of the meaning and when God's
[56:20] spirit quickens to you it's revealed to
[56:23] you by the way I said what's it doing in
[56:25] the hands of God waiting for Redemption
[56:28] claims he made a way of redemption he
[56:30] made a way back and someday the Redeemer
[56:32] is to take it back
[56:34] you see where we're getting to now he
[56:36] said we'll watch this fella sitting on
[56:38] the throne what is this book of
[56:40] redemption it's this abstract title deed
[56:43] an abstract shows the lean history
[56:45] ownership history all the problems with
[56:47] being able to claim it all the
[56:49] encompasses and what else it said an
[56:52] abstract deed shows us it shows the
[56:54] details of it I I thank God when God
[56:57] reveals to you his word it shows all the
[56:59] details of what you've got access to it
[57:02] shows every detail laid out there how it
[57:05] works how it happens and brother Adam
[57:07] said it's Redemption means all legal
[57:10] possession to all that was lost by Adam
[57:12] and Eve that you possess everything that
[57:16] Adam and Eve lost
[57:17] that's what is in this seven seal book
[57:20] that everything that they lost is given
[57:24] back to you
[57:25] all that that should make that should
[57:27] make anybody want to shout right right
[57:29] that everything they lost is given back
[57:31] to you when you can see it when you can
[57:34] understand he said that possession of
[57:35] that deed Adam could not meet the
[57:37] requirements of redemption after he
[57:38] found he lost it he needed Redemption
[57:40] himself
[57:41] so he could not do it now we're getting
[57:44] we're getting to the close how does the
[57:46] book come open
[57:47] ah
[57:48] he couldn't do it but the law required a
[57:51] Kinsmen Redeemer
[57:53] what's a Kinsmen Redeemer somebody
[57:55] to buy back everything that was lost
[57:58] a kinsman redeemer to bring you back to
[58:01] your possession
[58:02] to make you holy
[58:04] to cover you like Boaz did oh all of
[58:07] Ruth's all the history all her past when
[58:11] when Boaz threw that covering over her
[58:13] it covered all of that
[58:15] to cause you to rest to cease from your
[58:19] labor so that's why we need lamb tonight
[58:21] that's what I'm preaching about that's
[58:23] why we need a lamb we need a lamb and
[58:25] when you've got a lamb then the lamb
[58:27] makes you Worthy
[58:30] the lamb makes you worthy to read the
[58:32] book
[58:33] the man not your own worthiness not your
[58:37] own righteousness but it's what he did
[58:39] he's the one that paid the price for you
[58:42] he's the one that give you the Holy
[58:44] Ghost now come on now when he give you
[58:46] the Holy Ghost it wasn't just for to
[58:48] just to play around with but he gave it
[58:50] to you for a purpose to understand these
[58:54] words to understand him to have a
[58:56] relationship with him to know him
[58:58] oh we've got somebody that paid the
[59:01] price for us we've got somebody that
[59:03] covered us that paid it offer us to
[59:05] change us that's why brother Rand
[59:07] preached those messages about being
[59:09] changed that this word the the
[59:11] revelation of Jesus Christ will have an
[59:13] effect in your life it will change you
[59:16] and make you different and sanctify you
[59:18] and he said man was without a way back
[59:21] and there's no way for him to get back
[59:23] he was gone but the grace of God met
[59:26] this kinsman redeemer and the person of
[59:28] Jesus Christ law required it and Grace
[59:32] Grace met its requirements
[59:34] God's law required an innocent
[59:37] substitute
[59:38] but who was innocent
[59:40] everybody on Earth was born of a woman
[59:43] there's only one man well Adam was born
[59:46] without sexual desire but then he went
[59:49] away from God's word and caused all of
[59:52] the mess that we're in but there was
[59:54] only one man Jesus Christ that was born
[59:56] like he was virgin born and that's what
[59:59] brother Rams said every man had been
[1:00:00] born sexual after sex everyone and the
[1:00:04] only one that wasn't had forfeited the
[1:00:07] rice
[1:00:08] now now you think well just go for just
[1:00:10] a few more minutes every mystery of the
[1:00:13] Bible lays in these seals The Mystery of
[1:00:16] the whole book is in themselves that's
[1:00:17] why when the mystery is open you can
[1:00:19] trace every mystery all the way through
[1:00:21] the Bible That's why when you find out
[1:00:23] that you need a lamb you find out Abel
[1:00:25] needed a lamb too and when when Cain saw
[1:00:28] that his sacrifice was accepted that's
[1:00:30] where he he got real upset because Abel
[1:00:33] by Revelation knew he needed to lay him
[1:00:35] and when the lamb met the requirement it
[1:00:39] covered all of Abel's sins and it will
[1:00:42] cover all of your sins too and make you
[1:00:45] worthy to read the book not in your own
[1:00:48] word now listen if you're drawing back
[1:00:50] on me I will I've got a quote from
[1:00:52] Brother Dale where brother Dale said
[1:00:55] these exact words the lamb makes you
[1:00:59] worthy so don't draw back on me I'm
[1:01:01] telling I'm preaching what's been
[1:01:03] preached
[1:01:04] I'm preaching what Andrew Glover
[1:01:06] preached I'm preaching what brother Dale
[1:01:08] has preached for years I'm preaching
[1:01:10] what's been laying in the message for
[1:01:12] years I'm preaching I'm preaching the
[1:01:14] myth history of these things that the
[1:01:16] lamb was sufficient to make you Worthy
[1:01:20] in Revelation chapter 5 it says I saw a
[1:01:23] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:01:24] voice who is worthy to open the book who
[1:01:27] is worthy to open up the book
[1:01:30] John said there was no man in heaven
[1:01:32] found worthy no man on Earth found
[1:01:34] worthy no man beneath the Earth that
[1:01:36] ever lived and died was found worthy no
[1:01:38] man was found worthy but John wept
[1:01:41] because if no one was worthy and it
[1:01:43] could open this book of redemption the
[1:01:46] whole creation was lost
[1:01:48] you realize what that means If no man
[1:01:51] was found worthy to open up that book
[1:01:53] nobody's coming out of the grave
[1:01:56] none of those saints that have gone on
[1:01:58] are ever going to live on this Earth
[1:02:00] again they're stuck where they are the
[1:02:03] Earth is stuck going off into chaos with
[1:02:06] all these Sinners living on it that
[1:02:07] maybe drop bombs on it years from now or
[1:02:10] whatever and and there's nothing that
[1:02:12] can remedy the situation that the Earth
[1:02:14] is in all creation is lost if the seals
[1:02:17] are not opened up unless the lamb come
[1:02:19] forth and took that book and broke those
[1:02:21] seals there was no hope no
[1:02:25] and brother Branham said that John
[1:02:27] represents the church so he said if John
[1:02:30] here had to cry and weep and he
[1:02:34] represented the church because he was
[1:02:36] going up in the Rapture then the whole
[1:02:38] church was concerned here looking for a
[1:02:42] lamb
[1:02:43] and I think that behooves us all to be
[1:02:45] concerned this afternoon
[1:02:47] and one of the elders in verse 5 said
[1:02:49] one of the elders saith unto me weep not
[1:02:51] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:02:54] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[1:02:56] the book and to loose the Seven Seals
[1:02:58] thereof the lion has prevailed but when
[1:03:02] John turned to look
[1:03:04] he saw a lamb he saw a lamb that had
[1:03:07] been in battle you could tell he'd been
[1:03:09] in battle he'd been slain but he was
[1:03:11] alive again
[1:03:12] he had been in battle why why was he in
[1:03:15] battle why did he die on the cross so
[1:03:17] that you could be righteous
[1:03:19] holy
[1:03:20] Worthy
[1:03:22] if there was any worthiness it would
[1:03:24] have to be in that lamb
[1:03:25] where did it come from it come from the
[1:03:27] Father Strong
[1:03:29] now I know we're getting a little bit
[1:03:30] late on the Wednesday night service but
[1:03:33] I'm just I'm gonna just get into this a
[1:03:34] little bit more y'all probably be upset
[1:03:37] with me by the end but just bear with me
[1:03:39] a little bit long that brother Bob he
[1:03:41] always goes along
[1:03:43] John hadn't noticed this land before
[1:03:45] here you know he hadn't been missing
[1:03:47] before but we we need to we need to
[1:03:49] understand where the lamb come from
[1:03:52] to see this scene correctly where did
[1:03:55] that lamb come from where did he advance
[1:03:57] from in the vision he come from Glory
[1:03:59] where he's seated at the right hand of
[1:04:02] God you know when Peter on the day of
[1:04:04] Pentecost he come from out of that out
[1:04:05] of the upper room and he began to preach
[1:04:07] in Acts chapter 2 and he began to quote
[1:04:10] Old Testament scriptures talking about
[1:04:12] that God was now seated somewhere
[1:04:15] for David is not ascended into the
[1:04:17] heavens but he saith un himself the Lord
[1:04:19] said unto my Lord sit down on my right
[1:04:23] hand on the day of Pentecost God took a
[1:04:26] seat in the Old Testament there was that
[1:04:28] Mercy Seat why was it called a seat
[1:04:30] because that's where God would sit in
[1:04:32] Hebrews chapter 1 he said who being the
[1:04:35] brightness of his glory and the express
[1:04:37] image of his person and upholding All
[1:04:39] Things by the word of his power when he
[1:04:41] had by himself purged our sins after he
[1:04:43] cleaned us up then he sat down
[1:04:46] he sat down and where did he sit down in
[1:04:49] Hebrews chapter 10 but this man after he
[1:04:51] had offered one sacrifice for sins
[1:04:53] forever set down on the right hand of
[1:04:55] God he set himself down in Ephesians
[1:04:58] chapter 2 hath raised us up together and
[1:05:01] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[1:05:03] so now when you're born again your soul
[1:05:06] is actually in Heavenly in a Heavenly
[1:05:08] place and has seated together with
[1:05:11] Christ we're seated with him in
[1:05:13] Revelation chapter 3 to him that
[1:05:15] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:05:16] in my throne even as I also overcame in
[1:05:19] him sat down with my father in his
[1:05:21] throne he sat down in his father's
[1:05:23] Throne now but one day he'll take his
[1:05:25] own Throne as the son of David
[1:05:27] I'm so glad this afternoon that Jehovah
[1:05:30] God that Jehovah the Old Testament can
[1:05:32] come and set down in a man's heart and
[1:05:35] claim him and change him and sanctify
[1:05:37] and fill him and sit down and take
[1:05:39] rulership over that man and sitting down
[1:05:42] sitting down on the Father Strong in a
[1:05:44] man's heart isn't it strange isn't it
[1:05:46] strange that a a simple lamb had to take
[1:05:49] our place that he was the only one that
[1:05:51] was Worthy he had been on his
[1:05:54] mediatorial work back there but now he
[1:05:56] comes forth comes forth from the
[1:05:58] father's Throne to take the book
[1:06:03] I'll be I'm closing in just a moment
[1:06:05] brother Adam said remember he'd been on
[1:06:07] his mediatorial work back there but
[1:06:10] remember these seals are ready to be
[1:06:11] opened and the lamb come from the
[1:06:14] sanctuary of God Advance forward
[1:06:16] there's no blood on it no more for the
[1:06:18] blood-covered lamb has walked away
[1:06:20] he said he's the one that holds it God's
[1:06:22] law required a kinsman redeemer and the
[1:06:25] lamb come out boldly I am their Kinsmen
[1:06:28] I am their redeemer I now have made
[1:06:32] intercession for them and now I've come
[1:06:35] to claim their rights for them I've come
[1:06:37] to claim their rights and that they have
[1:06:39] a right to everything that lost in the
[1:06:42] fall and I've paid the price oh brother
[1:06:44] Don't It Make You Feel religious not by
[1:06:47] Good Works which we have done
[1:06:50] but by his Mercy it's his worthiness
[1:06:54] that we're depending on as as the
[1:06:56] musicians come forward I'm going to read
[1:06:57] what brother Dale said about this just
[1:06:59] to clinch the matter
[1:07:01] let's let's put the period on this
[1:07:03] brother Dale said it's what he makes us
[1:07:06] it's what he does he's the one that
[1:07:10] makes us worthy to read the book
[1:07:12] only through that Holy Ghost that you'd
[1:07:15] have would you be able to read this book
[1:07:16] and understand what's being said
[1:07:18] then he makes us worthy to do it I'm not
[1:07:21] worthy myself to take that I don't care
[1:07:23] how good you live or how clean a life
[1:07:25] you live or what you do you're not
[1:07:27] worthy to do it but he comes and makes
[1:07:30] you Worthy
[1:07:32] he comes and lives in you see then he
[1:07:37] can read the book
[1:07:40] oh you think about what a profound
[1:07:42] statement that is
[1:07:44] that he can read the book when he makes
[1:07:48] you worthy oh when you study these
[1:07:50] things out you'll find out when the lamb
[1:07:52] comes forth from the throne that is that
[1:07:56] super anointing that the bride has been
[1:07:58] looking for when the lamb comes forth
[1:08:01] from the throne you begin to be
[1:08:03] identified you can read the book
[1:08:05] different what what that's that story
[1:08:07] that brother is written there in the
[1:08:09] Bible where Jesus Took The Scroll of
[1:08:12] Isaiah and read from the book and
[1:08:15] identified himself
[1:08:17] when you can read from the book and
[1:08:19] identify himself that is that super
[1:08:22] anointing that we've been looking for
[1:08:24] where you're resting on what God is
[1:08:26] revealing to you as he shows you where
[1:08:29] you are
[1:08:30] in the book aren't you glad this morning
[1:08:33] as we stand to our feet are too glad
[1:08:34] that the price is paid aren't you glad
[1:08:37] that you've got a lamb
