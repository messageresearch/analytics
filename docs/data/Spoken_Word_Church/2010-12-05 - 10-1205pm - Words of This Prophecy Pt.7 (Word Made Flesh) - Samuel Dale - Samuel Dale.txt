announcements i generally forget something but anyhow your lord jesus we thank you for this day we thank you for an opportunity to be able together and we pray that you would just lift us up in you lord that we may this day in some way in every what form we could do it that we would magnify you that we would honor you lord and then we know and realize that if we honor you and magnify you and we try to make you known by the things lord that we say then we don't have to worry about it but you'll come and you'll make known your people and that's the desires of our heart be with each one be a little adam there lord and delivering father from this problem of the sicknesses and all and just helping and father bless those that are not here you know the hindering reasons and lord you just commit everything into your hand guide us now and keep us in jesus name amen revelations one we've read this many times but we'll keep on reading it the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now let's go to revelations uh three everybody knows verse 14 we'll just read that and then we'll go over to verse 21 and 22 and unto the angel of the church of the lady of siam's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god verse 20. behold i stand at the door knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will shut with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne now remember brother random is covering it that means we really only but you know even also as even as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his strong he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we're trying to look at these things and see the book of revelations and see how that it unfolds and to me it unfolds you know like the things that as i've said the prophet of god covered it one day he said no there's not a lot written about the church and the reason it's not a lot written about the church to me now is i believe that the church must come to the place until she becomes i want you to listen the church will become the word made flesh all right now we'll prove the point in a minute we'll get back to it that doesn't discredit down through any word because the new birth is the birth of the word and i show you where the prophet of god said luther had the word made flesh in his day in him all right so don't just get it that we're having to wait for over here but the very important part is this is our end of the story this is to you and i we thank god for all the other things but it's to you and i the hour that we're living and that's what i want to talk about now this is words of prophecy number seven but the subtitle or the next title is word made flesh now i want you to keep that in your mind that you know you say well we can't be that and brother branham i'll give it to you in a little while he said it outside of the corporal body of jesus christ that he was here just like he was now you can take what you want to for because that's that's up to you it's like i was trying to prove this morning or show the point that when we were speaking about angelic beings uh there was an angel come to john all right and that angel that come to john revealed to john the entire book of revelation right all right now uh that's the catch of what i'm trying to show you because here in the chapter one you you've got to deal with that and we find out that that was almighty god that we're talking about in bride form standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man gird about the pouts with a golden girdle so it would be in the feminist form all right and see it being that see we don't look for that to be the one that john uh fell down before in chapter one we know automatically who it is it's almighty god well then as we go along you know in throughout the the series you'll see it unfold more and more but my point this morning was what do you believe in angelic beings do you believe in angels when the prophet of god said all born-again believers have angels there was a sign to you as we read this morning hebrews 1 4 14 to be ministers of to bring us unto salvation those angels as i said this morning that it once guarded the tree of life to keep man away from it see after then the the uh the lord jesus christ coming now those angels are trying to run us to that tree of life which is the word of god all right and then trying to drive us through that they are the ones that are heirs of the salvation they have an angel to lead them and see you think well well no it's just the holy spirit when we read about three times this morning where the prophet of god said that people say well in this day brother random it's just a holy spirit he said that's not true he said there are angels he said because peter had one that come to him and said he already had the holy ghost but an angel come and got him out of jail paul had an angel in the boat to tell him about and he already had the holy ghost so then what is the angels of god they are those things that our thing what is it the beings that god created because they were the first thing god created was angels and see we just think that's just spirits with your spirit well see you keep going that way and when you do you're just going to totally do away with god being real because you're just going to take him back as to being a spirit right no he's a being those angels are real they are beings they're not just a cloud floating around or a good warm feeling you know and i gave it to you to end that the prophet said i reason for the fact that we don't see the angels of god he said god gave you an inward birth and from that you're supposed to follow god the outward birth we follow the natural but in the inward birth the then we're supposed to make contact with the supernatural god and why can't we believe for angels come and appear to us see that's where we mess up and don't believe it but then it's not to just say oh i've got an angel like he's feeling no i believe you i believe he's there because he's he's to be with those that without salvation to take care of us now in that then whether it be a messenger of earth a natural angel that we covered whether it be a investigating angel with flying saucers that the prophet talked about whether it be heavenly beings why can't we believe they're real well i just can't see how they're real well why well i can't see them well you've never seen jesus so that means you ain't saved that's what you're doing you don't realize it you're placing god so far away from you until he can't come to you why can't you believe angels are more real than you are well that's just where dude i just believe that this this kind of a spirit like we'll see that you're going to make god that or whatever the angels are remember they rotated off of god that's what your prophet said joe why can't we believe right now let's don't be silly you know and say wait now you're sitting on my angel i know what no um anna and julie used to have their buddies and they didn't want you to sit down in a certain place because their buddy was sitting there but they did have a good imagination it's not like that folks this is real salvation is real it is not just a well i feel like i'm saved but tomorrow i won't feel too good so i wonder where i am or not god is real the angels are real we are the reason that they don't contact us we are the reasons because we get other things in a way okay i gave it to you this morning but the they're ministering spirits to guide us to god no matter what i was saying whether it be an earthly messenger like brother brown church age messengers preachers whatever they're to guide us to god and then doing that see we can come out to be being the heirs of salvation they're actually ministering righteousness to us salvation peace you know like brother random wouldn't it be something for you to talk to an angel and an angel said don't you have no fear don't be afraid or nothing i'll be with you which oh that was just for brother brown now you're limited in yourself so that's the reason god can't contact you i believe he's here for all of us but around his angel won't help me but now here's the point i wanted to make sure we got even though brother brown had an angel to come to him at birth you know there and followed him all the time that angel didn't save him that angel could only lead him to god they don't that angel could only say don't drink don't smoke don't you there'll be a work for you to do right and that's you know you see those angels rotating off of god would they not be a part of god amen you know why can't we believe it all right but see we just say well it was just a holy ghost see then we're limiting ourselves and destroying all of the things and then we'll automatically look to brother bradley had an angel right well now miss plain and blunt if he had one and the prophet of god said i ought to redeem thy angels then we're the ones limiting it god's done what he said he'd do believe it all right see they are sent from god they are under control directly of the holy spirit amen and then by being in control of the holy spirit sin of god that angel couldn't tell brother brown something contrary to the word but you know what i love about it we were talking about it yesterday see when that angel would come and tell brother around something he proved he was a child of god you know how he spent the rest of the day checking the scriptures right he spent the rest of the day checking the scriptures to see what the angel said was right right there's a true childhood amen now let's get on to something that i've mentioned many times and i want to keep mentioning it now even though a messenger even though we could call him a prophet even though we would talk about an angel even jesus come to the disciples and led them for three and a half years but you know he couldn't reveal anything to him it takes the holy spirit to reveal it they can bring us to the channel they can lead us and guide us but you can't save us it takes the holy spirit to do that now after now we read in genesis 1 the revelation that god give to jesus to give to john and sent and signified by his angel okay now after that angel come to john to tell john of the book of revelations don't forget that jesus christ stepped on the scene to john now you understand what i mean that throw an angel a prophet or anybody tell you something if god don't step on the scene to reveal you mean you believed it that jesus christ well i'll find it somewhere in here i'll find it a minute it don't make no difference god has to reveal it or we don't get it that's the whole thing no what happened at patmos now follow me god give to jesus a revelation of jesus right and he gave it to an angel to bring it down to you and i in other words to record it he'd come to john all right but now get the point keep it in mind see then jesus steps on the scene to john he doesn't just leave it in an angel's hands he comes to make it known to john has that happened in our lives has brother branham been able to bring the word to you and i enough that jesus christ could step out of that word that's right do you and i it becomes something personal to us i thought that's what he's supposed to do what did john see i'm talking about john patlisten he saw the word made flesh he said oh wait just a minute now john the baptist once saw that i agree with you john the baby saw that but what if i could show you that jesus christ became so real that he's the word my flesh in your flesh right amen okay all right now let's see if we can follow that because when john saw what he saw automatically chapter two and three which is the seven church ages that's red letter edition in your bible which means that that's what jesus said so the proof was the angel could deliver the thought but he can't reveal the thought he can't make it manifest that's where people miss it on the adoption of series and things you know and brought around talk about manifestation of the sons and daughters of god and all i've ever heard preach out of that outside of just a few that's around with us pretty close all i've ever heard preach out of that is look at brother brown he can make the word manifest jesus can make the word manifest that's all we need is for them and not for us they don't even look up the word manifest the word manifest is to make known the angel made known to john what john needed and then when he made it known god stepped on the scene to vindicate it is he doing that to me and you see we've got to make him known we see everybody i want to be made known all right you show your great big stuff shirt you show you're not writing the gospel right because this is not to make you and i know it is to make him known right don't worry about it you make him known do you make you known i've never been worried about he's always took care of me but if i try to make myself known what do i get but if i'll make him known look at the word manifest see manifested sons of god brother and said that uh outside of this day where was it to be manifested sons well i just don't fit in you brother dale what are you looking for well i want to see you raise the dead heel to sit well you got all afternoon you want to talk about what god has done if you got the goods you don't have to worry about it dude i've seen everything but blinded eyes open i used to say i've seen everything with the dead rays but we got an opportunity and god raised a man from the dead his eyes would roll back and what could we do why did i do it wade can tell you he said daddy we got to do something this man is dying all i done was one thing his name is randall and i said randall what does that say looked around i believe god raised him from the dead he said well what was it doing i know that there was something different about that sound and why would i do it that way so you can say well that makes no no no this makes jesus christ that's all it makes don't make nothing out of me in you no way it makes jesus christ jesus christ came to john after john delivered the message now listen i i don't know how to get this together right here so please listen and try to help me the revelation come to jesus to give to the angel to give to john right but now when you're getting it look what it's actually doing the revelation come to give jesus to give to the angel to give to john but then immediately jesus steps on the scene you don't talk about the angel in chapter two and three now come on we got there it don't talk about the angel of god in chapter four either because you better believe one thing for certain it's not a red letter but john heard a voice in heaven say come up right amen the angel could only write that down you could only have john keep it together and let him write it he couldn't call the dead right so are we putting more emphasis upon the angel are we putting more emphasis upon jesus christ all right see jesus was the word you agree in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god in verse 14 said and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and you agree that he was the birth of the word the birth of what those prophets built his body he was that in manifestation now who would know more about what to do then to bring that word once again in the flesh now i'm going to make my statement and then you listen that's the reason chapter 2 and 3 is in red letter because jesus is showing you that it's him in the church it's not the church the bride you know it's him and the bride he's showing you his position because that was what was to be made known he didn't know his place in the kingdom right come on your prophet said he didn't know page 11 12 13 right in there over the church hitch book he didn't know his part in the kingdom but said when he come to general batman's he didn't know he knew exactly what the ages was going to be and he knew his part in the ages read something look at number one on your notes i quoted this the other night and i figured people you know would doubt the total of what i was really quoting so i decided maybe we'd read it and it's looking under jesus preaching phoenix arizona 1964. john the greatest of all prophets he was the one that introduced jesus jesus said he was greater than any man had been born now listen did you ever think why that was are you reading what brother said did you ever think why that was did you ever think why it was that john was the greatest of all the prophets he was the messenger of the covenant jesus christ was the angel of the covenant but john is the messenger of the covenant he stood between law and grace to introduce jesus christ but watch your prophet join the greatest of all prophets he was the one that introduced jesus jesus said he was greater than any man had been born did you ever think why that was now watching me will answer you all the rest of them spoke of him and all the prophets involved the word of the lord comes to the prophet that's the bible said so and all and in all the other prophets that come to them in visions but when the word came to john it was flesh jesus was the word he is the word he always was the word but here is where the fullness of god was made flesh and dwelt among us when he come to him in the water he was a prophet and if the word is made flesh he's got to come to the prophet the word wherever it is it must come to a prophet because the prophet is the one the word comes to and john was the prophet of the day now you see why john is the greatest of all the prophets when i found out when i had a little shout out he's the greatest from all the pride man why all the other prophets that would say in the scripture if you'll read it that the word of the lord came in a vision you know it saved the old testament prophets or the word of the lord was precious in the people of the day it would say those things because why because the word came even though melchizedek met abraham even though moses would see the great things that he saw but still john is greater and you know that john's ever done one miracle never to do away with our talks about well it's gotta be gotta be miracles john the greatest of all never done one miracle but he saw the word that was made flesh the greatest honor could ever be was to walk out in that water that day a man that john could turn and look and say from nine years old when i went into the wilderness until this day i waited but i was told what i must do john what are you supposed to do i'm the one i'm the voice or the one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way isaiah 40 running there 42 everyday john saw the word made flesh what a wonderful thing to think about no can you not realize them that when john was there on patmos now that was john the baptist it's on that okay nobody understand now john the writer and one of the apostles when he comes to patmos what does he see well he just saw a vision of no you didn't get what i was laying down there a moment ago the angel could bring it to john but the angel couldn't write down what was put in 20 verse chapter 2 and 3. and angel couldn't do that jesus came under sin john is seeing in the church ages the word made flesh now we should go home you'd have computers and just run in word made flesh or word flesh you know and just read all the things we would be here to pass 12 o'clock i got a bunch of lead on my desk about the word flesh see if you have the new birth never born again believer had the new birth right amen and that was the birth of the word because that's your new birth is the verse of the word and we were talking about in the bible study last night in the baptism in the holy ghost but the birth of the word that's why nicodemus couldn't comprehend he said you must be born again like what he was saying he didn't say that there was no nicodemus and you got to be anointed you've got to shout you got to do it no he said you must be born again every born-again believer for the day they were living was the word made flesh now let's see if you can swallow every prophet that ever brought the word to any age he was that word made flesh that's why they couldn't comprehend him that's why isaiah could sell virgins y'all conceived and he just couldn't understand that's why moses could write five books and tell you what happened in genesis you know it is so close until moses was god to the people that's what the bible says what's your prophet says for the hour he was living the word was made flesh he spoke it out of his lips that automatically sealed it up right because there was nobody that could comprehend what he'd say right that's what people don't understand anything when brother brown spoke it like that really opened it up now we run around smoking that's sealed it takes the holy spirit to reveal it i can talk all day long and do you no good but one word from god will give you the word make flesh you're understanding what john saul papers he saw jesus christ in the church down through seven ages right and they were the word made flesh for the hour that they were living amen right just as those prophets with the word make flesh for the day that we're living then john comes and he introduces the word no did not brother brown say that this prophet in the end time would be pointing to a word born bride that's what god thanks to you and i he didn't write as we mentally thinking of mine see we think well god was doing pretty good in the early church second third maybe fourth church age but then the fifth and sixth and seventh is just oh just so small you better read your bible it's odd how the bible is written it doesn't say that he was standing in the life stage read your bible one in the midst revelation 1 by 13. when in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks miss means middle so if you're going to take your carnality of saying that only the first church age when you read out from an amiga the only the first church egg had him in the last church egg had him and the rest of them didn't have nothing they had enough to get in the body of christ see then i'll quote you the scripture and your prophet where he said he stood in the midst mist means so if you're gonna be carnal so will i if you're gonna say he was only in the first in the last age i'm gonna say that your prophet and the bible said that he was in the middle age greater than anything because he was in the midst in the middle i can be just as carnal as you can you see carnality is not a revelation it simply means that he's god of every age hebrews 13 8 we may change but god don't change when you come to the age of martin luther god was just as happy to be there in that message of the just shall live by faith as he is to be here today why can't we believe it that way see the word for each age was jesus christ just as the word of each prophet was jesus christ right so the word of each age is jesus christ the alpha and omega is dealing with the ministry of the lord jesus christ the ministry not the birth it's dealing with the ministry did he have his ministry back there and he'll have his ministry down here so when we're reading this quote don't get all tied up with it just ready for what he's saying look at him on masterpiece it's all others never appeared again now he's talking about the vision he saw the bride and how these others that come down with naked and things they went off and was destroyed they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she's alpha and omega god the great sculpture has made him a masterpiece for the masterpiece and the son of god the masterpiece and the bride and it's a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the lord alpha and lumika what he was in the first church age he wants to be in the last now you better cover another point about for an omega whether you ever thought of it or not but as i said alpha and omega dealing with ministry you better deal with the ministry of jesus christ that he had while he was here on earth because brother branham come to bring back the other faith of the fathers but the faith of the fathers didn't bring the resurrection sign brother had the resurrection signed whether you believe it or not because you have to sign on the son of man right right that's resurrection sign you see brother around it looks like he's only placing it back in the first church age he's got to go back to there because that's true but the ministry of jesus christ when he's here on earth he's got to repeat here upon earth again we look at it and talk about brother branham but we better consider who we are right but i hope you're following me chapter 2 chapter 3 is the word made flesh i'm trying to prove to you that by jesus coming to john it shows that the bride would be the word made flesh just like john saw the word make flesh all right let's see where's that it's number 17 of your notes which is the message e40 escape come hither be the last markings on your notes 1958-2222 he said outside of the corporal body of jesus christ it's not 17 you don't have to find it okay maybe i left it later in the office honestly here it is 50 pages okay i didn't give you this i'm sorry all right you can have it let me get through because here's the message i thought i'd put it in here to joke with him the message escaped come here quickly 1958-2222 paragraph b 40. and if you see that the judgment of a god is so close at hand and remember at the judgment bar when i stand before you and you see that these things that i've said you don't have to wait till then are you listening to it hour by hour night by night jesus appears here in every form that he did outside of his corporal body when he walked on the earth he reveals the secrets of the heart he come down the other night before five do you only put it on him now listen let's keep reading he come down the other night before 500 people right here just exactly the way it did on the day of pentecost now how many knows what happened on that pentecost a mighty rushing wind brother brown was standing there they saw his coat actually moving the mighty rushing wind come through this is when it was happening he's telling about it when a roar started from the skies and everybody started looking here it come like a great thunder struck up here on the platform and roared out over the building not a wind blowing but lacquer rushing me what did we do what did we do instead of our hearts being a fire to sit around the town you know what he's saying go down we said it was pretty good yeah no doubt in my mind about it the rising trendy lamps he said you got too much oil mixed up with your spirit or too much water you'll make carbon that was when the holy spirit came down and come across the building and brought around said it's like a rushing wind he said outside the corporate body he's here why can't we believe that why can't we believe just these little simple things look at number two three numbers the true bride this is spoken words original seed page 82 1962 318 e the true bride like murray will have a virgin wound for the bride of the word which is christ when christ the word comes to the bride she'll be the same as he is a virgin by the word i hope i hope it's going over brother neville i see i hope you understand what was he word the word of god upon his vesturated name written the word of god in the beginning was the word and words with god the word was god and the word made flesh and dwelt among us he is god and god is the word and when his bride comes she'll be the same product that he is virgin continue to read did christ belong to a denomination did jehovah neither does his bride she's part of him she needs no dogma she won't have any she'll be absolutely virgin how by the word amen she'll punctuate every word god says with an amen amen oh be it unto me according to thy word oh my there you are punctuate god's word have a virgin womb what would she come out of a virgin wound the word what did jesus come out of a virgin wound he goes to tell you that when adam come to his wife she was pregnant with death but when when god came to mary she was pregnant with life but when joseph the human come to his wife glory can't hardly hold her she was fragilated with life the word of gosh god flesh do you understand what i'm trying to say john on papa was shown the same thing that john the baptist saw on the river jordan the word made flesh the only difference is who the who lives in when it was here on earth it was in one man now it's in the bride you know i just don't see that if we had it but we have more your what's wrong with it when you say that when you say if we had it you are the one that doubted sorry why not thank god for every little thing we got instead of barely aching and griping but what we don't have what would our lives fit in his life right tormented all his life by devils and beating stones and all kind of things and yet will and i got a little problem you just don't understand brother do you we were talking about it yesterday i thought we're supposed to come to church when it's sick now come on because of the rest of the people that's in here somebody comes in here with a temperature we'll put you back here in the nursery you can sit in there and then we'll pray for you i said because of the rest that's in here do you tell me brother dale you don't need to go visit these people that are sick you'll get sick i'm not gonna get sick never seen it yet say no challenge that one okay i walk in the room with people out there what do you think's wrong with you well i got some i'm gonna i'm gonna stay over here brother moak said they prayed for a man one night and it was kind of dirty you know the guy was kind of dirty okay and they went to pray for him and said when they got ready to praise it y'all was reaching over and he said he seen one man reaching way over and he put one finger on the guy's head i guess he's gonna trust one finger what are you afraid of what are you afraid of little brother said you can't go in there where your babies are at you'll get that disease or is he afraid of it that's the problem you're afraid and being afraid you bring on this sickness when i brother dale i went with a man and i'm i'm not saying nothing against it who visited a church one night and i prayed for a whole bunch of people that was sick and we were fixing to go eat and got in the brother's car and called his name or nothing but got in his car and we started down the road he said here brother dale and he handed me a bottle over there i mean this has done been 45 minutes if i don't get anything that doesn't got it but he said here wash your hands with this you know older i don't know what they call it to kill all the bacteria so wash your hands with this before you go eat i didn't make no big scene i do just wash my hands when i don't forget you go up to the hospital everybody goes to they go in and they come back and blow things in and the hospital is costing them thousands of dollars for the little bottles that they have to everybody pop on when the hospital is full of germs floating in why don't you get you a mask and put it on or better still why don't you get you one of these spaceship helmets whole suit and walk in to pray for somebody you say well you will not be that silly i agree with you you don't not even have to be mentioned why are we afraid you're afraid because you don't know where you're at i trust him i don't trust some bottle in the hospital some german killed her i trust god and we'll charge look what he said on for number four he knows still all spoken words reading the seed which is page 83 bring back that spoken word bring back that word of god which was the word here come through a human's womb amen god will do it anyhow where is it going to come through now the human wound or the bride is that not what we just read about with the spoken word this to come through the womb the wound of the word it'd be good to read restoration of the bride tree and and spoken words original seed because look at restoration of the bride tree page 62. now once he was god's perfect prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen glory i'm going to say something directly if he is the bridegroom tree you believe it for the garden of eden then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bright tree she's got to be born by the same material the word made flesh from the tree i hope you get it the same life in this female tree the bride groom as it is in the bride the worst introducion you do is that right you say that ain't scriptural really in other words you say that ain't scriptural what that he's got to have a female tree you've got to have a bridegroom probably gonna have a bride you say that ain't scriptural well it is i caught that now see we're gonna have it going we're fixing to have our healing meeting in a minute i caught that he was you want proof of it he said i am the vine ye are the branches where's the fruit bar at amen least on the vine the virgin branches i am the vine you are the branches you brother fruit and the male tree and the female tree produces the pollen one to the other that brings the fruit and the brights and the vine does the same thing he made the choice to join himself to you and i thought he's got to be responsible it's like i told him last night in the in the bible study i said now that if choice told me something i can depend on that and you know i might not claim that for a long time but i still believe she'd do what she said but one day i could walk up there and say joyce you remember what you promised me because i believe she'd do it because i know where that way well why can't we believe god i want god obligated to me oh now boy you really went wrong hey we are obligated to him for everything we have breathe in the air you breathe don't get garbaged up in what i'm saying why don't i do like i do let me just tell you why do i pick up most of the meal tickets why do i buy a lot of things for a lot of people you know why i want you obligated to me i may wind up one day they don't have no money i may have to say danny i can't pay for it this time can you pay for the meal i know he would but because you know why because i paid for a lot of them i'd rather have you obligated to me than me obligated to you now god is obligated to believe you because of what he said that's the only obligation he's got to you and i he said if you can believe it brother brown said if you can find it in the bible you can call god on the scene and if he don't do it you can call him a liar now that's a direct quote from your prophet now that's not haphazardly i'll just there lord do that now be serious i never got serious with god and i didn't see him fulfilled he said well we need a lot of things i do but i try not to be that serious i try to be serious about this word first all right amen now this is our own opportunity he said you said that in scripture lisa i caught you you know that brother around said god is not complete without you may i record it maybe it said he said the guardian is not complete without you maybe that's the word look what he done you look down through the ages and you see they all mess up and you see the people you see luther in them with the trinity doctrine you see all of the things taking place smoking a pipe set in a beer you know i'm sitting in a pub drinking beer talking about the bible but he had a new birth well i don't see i can have it there and i can't do it now well why do you want to do it amen i mean are you wanting to drink and smoke no no i just don't understand how come i have to be different because you're in another age and the requirement of this age requires somebody to buy the bunt okay we'll get on no i'm gonna have to cut this off and do it later again but listen i want to make sure you get these things and then we'll we'll get on to the other so read feist with me all right number six feast of the trumpets 64 7-19 and now how he said it'll appear the last days to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her make the revealed word what is your make the revealed word that's why this has to happen he wasn't in the reformers wasn't in luther wesley and the pentecostals in them the scripture said it wasn't but it will come that is his promise for this age now we're living the age that his coming will be she must be identified in him anyone who must be identified with her husband for the two or one and christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two are one and he is the word not the denomination word we are to be the children of the light of the light and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word all right the word make flesh is the light of the age when you see it the bible said so identified masterpiece you read all the rest of these because if you don't read them you don't care about it anyway i'm sorry you see we have to be the word made flesh in this age that was what was revealed to john on patents that the word would be flesh all right down through the ages it wasn't in its fullness well you're in the end time we're to come back to the same ministry that the lord jesus christ had we're to come back to be the word made flesh to us according to how we yield ourselves unto him we must be the word made flesh because that's what john saw in chapter two and three because remember chapter 4 was the rapture he saw an open door and the voices said come up there's not much written about the church but the thing of it is she's the word made flesh and how did it wind up to prove the point revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh i regret to sit with me in my throne now that's not the father's trump that's his throne listen even as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne as he and god was one he and the bride must be one the word made flesh what did john see the word made flesh what did the angel bring to john the word but jesus come to make it legal the angel come to join her to deliver the word yes but jesus come to make it live the prophet of god brought the message to you and i but the holy spirit has to come to make it live we must be the word made flesh in our flesh all right yeah let's don't see it see ours what are you looking for well what i want to see and i to see somebody stand up there and just call out like brother brown and call it out that was never a promise to me but to one man do you take your unbelief and whittle away all you want to but it won't stop god he's done showed in chapter two and three that they would be a bride that would be the word made flesh that's what you revealed he said we'll prove that okay chapter four verse one rapture takes place that's pretty good proof but you see we want to take our unbelief and our carnality and say i just don't see it all right evidently you don't if that's the way you think but do you mean nobody won't have it just cause you don't have it now better to be something for us to think about i i just don't believe in them fellows going down his face i just don't believe in that well now who are you for to decide this on i believe the word is made flesh well we're sure i'll agree but it's because of ourselves we are the ones who let the devil get on us and your prophet of god said we read this morning what keeps god the angels of god from coming to us we've got too many things in between us and him we're the one doing it and then we blame god then we get down and pray we say but lord why wouldn't you do this if we had run around here now he could tell us why did we have right around here today now he can tell us why as i said this morning or was it not started brother connie if you don't know what your problems are that's the biggest problem you've got you are your problem that's your biggest problem if you don't know your problems you know why because you're hiding you're trying to deceive everybody else you're being a hypocrite instead of just being straight been honest because it's a whole lot better to say i know what my problem is ain't gonna do nothing about it that's better than saying i don't know what my problem is brother dale i wish you'd tell me my problems no you don't want to know your brother because when you know your problems you got to do something about it does anybody in here want to argue that point will whoever the communion spend the rest of the evening your problem is you and then you want god to override no he won't override and you won't see what other people see because you won't follow the rules of the book you want me to call out and tell you what's wrong with you stand up sister johnny stand mr johnny now what your problem is you said i am see what you want me to do is go through your life and tell you what you've done this week see that wasn't what brother branham he said one of these days i'll show you this was not right is that the statements he made it was never to been used to reveal the secrets of the heart the secrets of the heart never converted anybody he said all these do and just bring you the presence to you to recognize the presence of god is here in other words i tell sister johnny something that she was thinking something she'd done this morning she said well god's got to be with the man now they're going to save her he said this gift ain't going to save nobody he said i'll show you sometimes it wasn't right the preaching of the gospel is what it is see because the preaching of the gospel will make the word flesh you want to know what's wrong with you go look in the mirror and did you say now lord i see my problem my problem is me dude that's why brother dale don't preach like other preachers because you see that makes it harder than to just tell you now george what you need to do i saw you dresses the other day it was up just a little bit too far you know a little bit this way that way do this do that the other she's got a mirror come on sisters you stand in front of a mirror and your knees are showing do i have to come along and tell you your knees are showing come on and we say where the word make flesh we're talking about the word made flesh and we want to talk about other things like one of these things you say well you could say a lot about this now the other sure can but if you don't know your problems wouldn't it be no good to tell you i mean that way say you know take out slipping around a little bit and smoking a little pot he comes to me and he said daddy tell me my troubles i said go look in the mirror he wanted me to tell him other things how sweet it is and how nice he is he ain't wanting me to tell him what it is you don't want me to tell you your problem because you'd have to agree that's right let's straighten up ourselves read the book and see what the book says right you know what i brother dale i want your word on what's right and wrong now you're trying to get me to be your crutch right i'm not going to be your crutch no i'm going to be your preacher we don't have to worry about crutches let's stand together let's go into the communion first corinthians 11 23 forever received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed to bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take heed this is my body which is broken for you it's doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this dude is off does he drink it in remembrance of me as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoe the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink of damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will i sit in order when i come let's just take a moment and just think about it you know your troubles for me to tell you won't make you change a lot of divorces are coming and things because people won't look at the signs of their own lives and things we know ourselves i know my problems better than you do what bothers me wouldn't bother you at all but what bothers you wouldn't bother me maybe at all because we're different human mortals instead we have no excuse we stand openly before god because that's one thing that hebrews 4 12 says the word is sharper than a two-edged sword if the preaching of the gospel will not bring light to your eyes of the sins of your life then for me to tell you won't change as i was trying to bring out this morning of the angel of god you think about your angel he's a direct connection to the holy spirit there's cherubims there's seraphims to keep the worshiper clean direct connection and we we would want to hinder them remember we don't get by with anything all things are made known in this day you may hide it from me but you won't hide it from god i may hide from you but i can't hide from god take on these things think about the communion supposed to be the overcomer are we overcomers supposed to be for those that have wrestled it out and it comes forth are we overcomers take on these things father we thank you that you have given us your word and that your word is true now that we come to this time of the communion help us to realize realization and father we love you and we thank you it says that they take them a few moments and have just a moment of silence prayer praying one for the other you pray especially for me let's do this just for a few moments and just think about our lives and ourselves and our doings because we're not hiding from nobody let's just silently pray before god just bless each one of us lord as we go into this part of the service and just have your way forgive our sins and cleanse us make us worthy to be able to partake of this that's just an example but one day a reality will be more real than ever in our lives when we see you we love you and we thank you and just be with each one the bible said he took bread and he blessed it father we thank you for this bread that's been made for this purpose this afternoon we pray that you would just sanctify the bread and the partakers that we may be one together in you we know that this bread is representative of the word and we believe your word so help us to as we eat this bread that we think about you that this is your body that was given for us because you was the word make flesh and we are the word made flesh when we let the spirit of god go through our beings we love you and we thank you sanctify the bread and the partakers in jesus name i always think about the children of israel when they were fixing to leave out of egypt a very sacred time to them very sincere time it was a very sincere time in the upper room when the lord jesus instituted the communion he was fixing to die his last act was to try to steal them that this was the fulfilling of the word this is what all of those days and feasts and times was all about lord you took the wine and you blessed it and you said take drink this is my body i mean my my spirit that was given to you for where that we could take it and drink it and let it be a quickening upon that word that we have ate today so let your holy spirit be with each one of us this is not your blood it's just it's just wine that was made for a purpose but it'll stimulate that bread that we do eat and it'll become blood vessels in our body lord how much greater is the revealed word help us to realize who you are and what you have made us you've made us the word made flesh again upon the earth we love you and we thank you in jesus name good morning i was by the river i'll carry my there's glory for me sometimes i'm despised and rejected and i questioned how then i take one more look at my calvary and it gives me the strength to rest me the ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the come morning dirt glory for me the church when we get over there the things will be gonna be a lot different we're gonna see reality as reality sure we have the human problems here of life we look for things and have our minds set on a certain thing that has maybe got to be before a rapture can come but you know i wonder what the disciples had their mind set on it certainly must not have been the way that it took place because it didn't do much good did it but he must have had it figured out wrong they didn't realize that jesus was going to have to die never dawned on them that that would be what would have to take place they thought maybe he was going to take over the world and even after his death and his resurrection they still thought he was going to restore the natural kingdom to israel they still didn't know what he's talking about see church do we have a reality let's all protect together you can be seated for a moment we're getting ready to have the foot washing if you'd like to turn over into john chapter 13 verse 2. and the supper being the end of the devil having now put in the heart of judas is carrick simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feeding to wipe them with the towel where with he was girding then come as he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord just i wash my feet and jesus answered and said unto him what i do that i know it's not now but i shall know hereafter peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wasted not dies no part with me simon peter said unto him lord not my feet on me but also my hands and my head jesus says to him he that is worse needeth not saved towards his feet but he's clean ever with and you are clean but not all for he knew should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so after he'd washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what i've done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's things for i've given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say indeed the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's stand together and be dismissed and the sisters can go downstairs for the foot washing and just pray one for another remember us as we'll be traveling and we're willing tomorrow and in the hall and take a few days and hunt a little bit and all just you know we just pray to the lord take care of us give us a safe journey and everything that we'll be all right okay father we love you and we thank you we ask you now that you would just come and be with each and every one of us and to remind us of these things that we have talked about and as we go on our way home after we finish with the foot washing that you will be there to talk to us and that you will show us our ways our lives and our things that we need to straighten up and get right and move on with you forgive our sins and lead us by that understanding and keep us in the light of your love bless those that are not here lord and as we finish up the night are we through and we go home be with everybody on the way home give a safe journey we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen you dismissed
