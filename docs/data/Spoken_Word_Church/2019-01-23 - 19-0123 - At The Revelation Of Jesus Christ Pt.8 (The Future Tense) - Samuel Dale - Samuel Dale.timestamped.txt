[2:44] thought of what we want to do in the
[2:46] church ages you know we'll try to want
[2:49] to try to this ease up to that spot and
[2:51] then we'll drop over into it the Lord
[2:54] within the next service but just
[2:56] probably one for another member
[2:58] Terrence had already asking remember my

[3:28] allowed us to receive and we just let we
[3:32] just ask you to let your light shine
[3:33] then from that into our hearts that we
[3:37] may have Lord what you want us to have
[3:40] and being where we're supposed to be

[4:10] word not return unto the void but to
[4:14] accomplish whatever it sent for we love
[4:16] you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen
[4:22] first Peter we're going back to read
[4:26] from verse 7 because we want to get the
[4:29] whole talk that they're trying of your
[4:32] faith being much more precious than gold
[4:35] that perishes though it be tried with
[4:38] fire might be found unto praise and
[4:41] honor and glory or at the appearing of
[4:44] Jesus Christ whom having not seen you
[4:48] love in whom though now you see him not
[4:51] yet believing you rejoice with joy
[4:54] unspeakable and full of glory receiving
[4:57] the end of your faith what is the end of
[4:59] your faith even the salvation of your
[5:01] souls of which salvation the prophets
[5:04] have inquired and searched diligently
[5:06] who profits out of the grace that should
[5:09] come unto you searching what or what
[5:12] manner of time the Spirit of Christ
[5:14] which was in them did signify when it
[5:18] testified beforehand the sufferings of
[5:20] Christ and the glory that should follow
[5:22] under whom it was revealed that not unto
[5:26] themselves now it was revealed to him
[5:28] now then not unto themselves but unto us
[5:31] they did minister the things which are
[5:34] now reported unto you by them that have
[5:37] preached the gospel unto you with the
[5:40] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which
[5:43] things the angels desire to look into
[5:45] okay now when we get to that part then
[5:47] what do we do where for our dire for
[5:49] Ernest let's get started now on this
[5:52] right
[5:53] core for gird up the loins of your mind
[5:55] be sober and hope to the end for the
[5:59] grace that is to be
[6:00] brought into you at the revelation of
[6:03] Jesus Christ amen now let's go over to
[6:08] revelations 1 and we'll start with verse
[6:14] now remember this is given to John to
[6:17] write to the churches he names them
[6:19] verse 11 verse 12 says and I turned to
[6:23] see the voice that spake with me and
[6:24] being turned I saw seven golden
[6:26] candlesticks in the midst of the seven
[6:29] candlesticks one like unto the Son of
[6:31] Man clothed with a garment down to the
[6:34] foot and Girt about the paps with a
[6:36] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[6:38] were white like wool as white as snow
[6:41] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[6:44] his feet like unto fine brass as if they
[6:47] burned in a furnace and his voice as the
[6:49] sound of many waters the prophet says
[6:53] many preachers witnesses page 57 church
[6:56] age book he had in his right hand seven
[6:59] stars and out of his mouth went a sharp
[7:02] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[7:05] as the Sun Shine ahthe in his strength
[7:08] and when I saw him I fell down at his
[7:10] feet as dead you know that his right
[7:13] hand upon me saying unto me fear not I
[7:17] am the first and the last I am he that
[7:20] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[7:23] Alive for evermore amen and I have the
[7:27] keys of hell and of death
[7:29] write these things which thou has seen
[7:33] and the things which are and the things
[7:37] which shall be Hereafter
[7:40] the mystery of the Seven Stars which
[7:44] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[7:48] Seven golden candlesticks now here's the
[7:50] mystery the seven stars are the angels
[7:53] of the seven churches and the seven
[7:56] candlesticks which thou sawest are the
[7:59] seven churches you may be seated the
[8:03] Lord that is blessing to the reading of
[8:05] the word now I want to try to get a
[8:08] thought
[8:09] and come right up to us part because
[8:12] we've read over now too and if you will
[8:14] read the church ages and things you know
[8:18] we will the Lord will then try to start
[8:21] with chapter two be in the first church
[8:24] age but I want you to follow a thought
[8:28] with me and keep that thought in mind if
[8:32] you remember when we started this series
[8:36] or thoughts we were talking about the
[8:40] marvelous thing that you could think
[8:43] about how the Bible came into being how
[8:50] did it actually came into being and how
[8:53] did it covers way it does there's no
[8:56] book nothing could ever be anything
[9:00] close to way the way the Bible is not
[9:03] that we talked about Moses that he could
[9:06] stand over here some 3,000 years I don't
[9:10] know exactly but you check it's come up
[9:13] close about 3,000 years after the
[9:17] creation of the world and things and he
[9:20] stands there and writes about what took
[9:23] place back there all right see then in
[9:28] his writing
[9:30] you know coming on through Genesis
[9:33] Exodus Leviticus and thought as he
[9:35] become on through then he would write of
[9:40] what was to take place and what was
[9:44] taking place all right see then he would
[9:49] go on to write of the future all right
[9:54] see now he he wrote that they would be
[9:57] down there in Egypt for so long and then
[10:00] their words are and then they you know
[10:03] they finally came out he wrote it they
[10:06] would come out so then it's past present
[10:10] and future all right now we're going to
[10:13] get into a little catchphrase I guess
[10:16] you called it a little cult as we enter
[10:18] this on the church ages because the
[10:21] church ages do not deal with the past
[10:26] I've told you I'm trying to get you to
[10:29] look at something about the Bible there
[10:31] is a pice tense a present tense and a
[10:35] future tense in the Bible all right but
[10:39] the further we get in toward the end of
[10:41] it you know the writings the way that
[10:45] it's written you you won't be covering
[10:48] the past you'll be covering the present
[10:53] and looking into the future but in this
[10:58] age only will the present tense and the
[11:06] future tense become one in other words
[11:10] everything will come to an end
[11:11] are you with me it'll come to an end all
[11:14] right
[11:15] so it'll come to a future tense in the
[11:19] Book of Revelations all right because
[11:21] now getting the point of what we've been
[11:24] talking about see John writes to the
[11:28] church ages right one two three four
[11:32] five six seven you realize that he stood
[11:35] back dire and he wasn't necessarily
[11:39] right in the past the Book of
[11:42] Revelations is not about the
[11:45] you say oh yeah tells this to tell come
[11:48] on this listen to what I'm talking about
[11:50] it's dealing more with present tense
[11:54] something's happening something we can
[11:58] see and follow it read it in the
[12:02] newspaper we can know it all right but
[12:06] then we know that there's a future tense
[12:09] that comes into view but now you see
[12:12] where we're going to have to go to
[12:14] because in this age the pice will be
[12:19] annihilated
[12:23] all right the present comes into view
[12:29] and you see the future but what about in
[12:36] this age when the present tense and the
[12:39] future tense becomes one now that's the
[12:42] thought for tonight because to me that's
[12:45] the way that we can see the reality of
[12:48] the Bible and what it's about
[12:50] all right now the prophets as we read
[12:54] they knew something was taking place and
[12:58] they wrote or testified of it and said
[13:03] things you know but it was really
[13:05] speaking the war to where we're you know
[13:08] we're at as Paul said all right now what
[13:13] you see a lot of the Old Testament we
[13:16] read that as a pice tense you know back
[13:21] time in excuse me how fast it yo
[13:23] attempts before a pice tense all right I
[13:27] want to make sure my words right because
[13:29] this does go out and it's bad enough to
[13:32] follow this old southern feller anyway
[13:34] but see when you're reading the Bible
[13:37] you read the Bible you read the Old
[13:40] Testament very little do you relate from
[13:43] the Old Testament into the New Testament
[13:45] other than tops and shadows showing
[13:49] something all right
[13:50] because it is already past all right now
[13:57] Jesus came and lived never wrote right
[14:02] he never wrote he was present tense you
[14:07] remember what we were getting at the
[14:09] life of the message last week or Sunday
[14:12] see the I am is ever-present for
[14:17] eternity
[14:18] all right see when Jesus came on the
[14:21] scene everything was present tense
[14:27] he may have spoke of future things but
[14:37] it was really present tense because once
[14:39] that future tense is reached it is
[14:44] present tense you remember that was the
[14:46] point I'm trying to get across Sunday
[14:48] get a present tense to something
[14:50] happening now I'm warning you to see the
[14:54] Bible is now being written not having to
[14:58] pin it it's being lived the the writing
[15:03] has caught up how would you say it the
[15:07] writing has caught up with the
[15:08] manifestation until it's actually living
[15:15] see what it's not reading a past tense
[15:17] Bible now there's things it was past
[15:24] tense right there was things in the Old
[15:26] Testament fast in some president tell
[15:28] most of it present and there was a
[15:30] future speaking of things to come but
[15:34] here comes the Lord Jesus never wrote a
[15:36] word why because he was present tense
[15:42] all right now the end did Paul in him
[15:48] write of a future or did they tell her
[15:52] what was taking place
[15:56] are you following in that they did write
[15:59] of the future now there was prophecy
[16:01] changed in a moment went through the
[16:03] night etc that's fine prophecies because
[16:06] it'll always be that until we reach that
[16:08] place
[16:11] really the all of those writers of the
[16:19] UH Matthew Mark Luke and John see they
[16:24] were not written till about 53 80
[16:25] I mean 53 somewhere 50 something 80 50
[16:30] we read where John says so it's on to
[16:33] remember that was not Penn and it's
[16:38] audited that Luke and Mark were not
[16:46] original disciples they would not die
[16:49] with the Lord Jesus when he said this
[16:51] time they were not writing down this
[16:53] that they were writing from their own
[16:56] and I love the Book of Luke that's
[16:59] always been even in the denomination I
[17:01] remember that I've always loved the Book
[17:03] of Luke you said well I like Mark or I
[17:05] like I like John and I like it I like
[17:09] Luke Luke starts off with the most
[17:13] marvelous statement that could ever be
[17:15] made by a man that maybe I'm just saying
[17:19] maybe never saw Jesus I don't know where
[17:23] he did or not just I didn't argue we if
[17:25] he's they did I'm just making a point
[17:28] that he was not dying with thee the
[17:32] disciples to walk with the Lord Jesus
[17:34] for three and I have here but look what
[17:36] he says when he first starts he said
[17:39] having perfect understanding now that's
[17:48] marvelous in really that's the first few
[17:51] words in in the Book of Luke having
[17:54] perfect understanding now you know he
[17:58] got most of his understanding about what
[18:02] took place to write by listening to
[18:05] somebody else right but see the reason I
[18:11] love the Book of Luke see if I'm going
[18:13] to argue between Mark and John or or
[18:15] whatever and there's three two I two
[18:18] blind men and one blind man on it you
[18:21] can generally go to the book of
[18:22] especially go to the book of John John
[18:24] is prophetic he's good but Luke says
[18:29] having perfect understanding or to get
[18:34] it they got it from what he heard right
[18:41] but he got it by revelation from the
[18:48] Word of God all right you get my point
[18:51] now Jesus never wrote a word I am
[18:54] present tense the disciples never rode
[19:00] right dire sea we think you know we
[19:03] always think there's John he's sitting
[19:05] on Jesus is talking and he's writing and
[19:08] he's know it's 50 years later before
[19:15] those were actually put in pen to me
[19:20] that's marvelous because it gives the
[19:23] opportunity for Satan to come in and try
[19:27] to change things but it gives the
[19:29] importance to it that the Holy Ghost can
[19:31] keep the word straight it don't make no
[19:33] difference what's going on with the
[19:35] world and what they're saying you
[19:38] understand what I'm getting at I don't
[19:42] care what they say in this message how
[19:44] this is this and that's bad and this is
[19:46] wrong here and that's there and this do
[19:47] it this message that means Jesus Christ
[19:54] so what you think about it and you're on
[19:58] the internet certain things and you
[20:00] think well he's wrong here or he was
[20:01] done this way I have no time to argue
[20:05] with you about anything don't send me an
[20:11] email
[20:12] won't you to discuss it because I'm
[20:14] gonna tell you my answer was on tape
[20:18] number date so-and-so because that's the
[20:22] way I preach this and that's where I
[20:23] stand
[20:24] all right are you getting the point here
[20:28] comes the Apostle Paul to be the first
[20:33] church age messenger
[20:37] right and he dies before JA never rots
[20:45] Bo's already dead for John went to
[20:47] patent all right
[20:54] it's a marvelous book to have and I
[21:02] don't mean this wrong God forgive me the
[21:03] only way I got sense enough to take
[21:07] something that would look like it could
[21:10] be the most easily wrong easily to be a
[21:17] bad book to read or whatever because of
[21:21] a lot of the things that you read in
[21:23] there then yet God keeps it straight
[21:30] that's wonderful that is wonderful to me
[21:35] all right cuz now look as I said over
[21:41] and over to get you to a point the Bible
[21:45] is the Word of God delivered to mankind
[21:49] and it deals with the age that you're
[21:53] living in all right now you followed me
[21:59] then see what about a time comes what is
[22:03] that song Oh what is it you slow down
[22:07] and I'll speed up or what is it that's
[22:09] your song like that or something Oh
[22:12] Aaron he's shaking his head so I hear
[22:14] there must be one what you see time and
[22:20] eternity is going to meet in this age
[22:24] not in the next days because there's not
[22:26] another age I don't care how much longer
[22:30] this age keeps going and how many of us
[22:32] dies put it on my tombstone if I die
[22:36] brother Dale is still looking for
[22:39] something to become more into a reality
[22:43] because that's what I've always looked
[22:45] for and I've always seen the Bible that
[22:48] way
[22:49] to see it as not a future something or
[22:52] even a highest of something but to see
[22:56] it as a reality of being right now and
[23:00] listen if you get it over and over this
[23:03] age the past and the present is going to
[23:08] catch up to the future go to future
[23:13] angle and slow down it's going to catch
[23:19] up all right then see why not cover it
[23:27] and think about it here's the Book of
[23:30] Revelations penned about 80 53 somewhere
[23:39] in there worry we don't John was on
[23:41] Patmos you know I mean 92 93 John don't
[23:46] Pat must to wrap the word alright now
[23:51] the first church age was already
[23:55] dwindling away but the time John writes
[24:00] what he's saying okay what said well
[24:04] okay that was some post but then Paul
[24:08] came on the scene as personal to the
[24:12] first church age still under that that's
[24:15] timing lapsed over even back but yet
[24:18] Paul is on the he's in a present perfect
[24:21] tense his writing wasn't guessing or
[24:27] planning or looking backwards or looking
[24:30] this way it was reality it was real when
[24:35] we see the Bible like that when you see
[24:41] it like that as a reality of life you'll
[24:44] see why brother Dale has always hollered
[24:46] so much about to recognize what's taking
[24:50] place what has taken place wonderful
[24:55] that's faith filter what's going to be
[24:58] in the future is great but we're not
[25:00] dying
[25:04] we're here but what about when here
[25:10] catches up with our you see what I'm
[25:15] driving after when all of this comes
[25:18] down to the bases that we see reality as
[25:22] a living reality of life and were
[25:26] wrapped in change our thoughts and make
[25:31] us happier about it to think God thought
[25:37] so much of us till he put us in his word
[25:42] never how you'd say that you know as
[25:45] part of it or what and then now he's
[25:49] revealing he's revealing himself go now
[25:59] remember the point so we back up just to
[26:00] her and come through remember the point
[26:03] where we started verse 1 2 & 3 then 4 4
[26:09] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 through chapter 1 it
[26:14] showing who he is the Prophet said he
[26:19] wanted John to know who he was before he
[26:21] told him anything all right so it's
[26:24] revealing who he was or who he is then
[26:29] when you hit where was reading today
[26:30] with the twelfth verse coming down to
[26:33] the 13th it's coming in to seeing what
[26:37] something personal showing were here
[26:42] more feed him more feed through his
[26:49] death burial resurrection and the coming
[26:52] of the Holy Ghost back into the bride
[26:54] across him more feed itself right into
[26:58] the church in the midst of the seven
[27:01] golden candlesticks alright and as he
[27:05] does he's bringing reality to life cuz
[27:13] that's the whole point
[27:15] remember that remember that statement in
[27:17] a minute we'll get back as reality of
[27:19] life all right so he said all right I'm
[27:27] going to show you where I'm going I'm
[27:28] gonna in Morphy now I hope you caught
[27:33] the life stalks I was making on that
[27:35] message to think about that before we
[27:42] would ever begin our journey on earth
[27:47] that God would write until how perfect
[27:52] you are are you listening that God would
[28:00] write not to now we're gonna get into it
[28:02] because we're gonna have to divide it up
[28:03] we're gonna have to divide up something
[28:05] in the church ages so I want to hit
[28:07] there now I'll say what I'm gonna do and
[28:09] then we'll go back all right
[28:12] see we're gonna have to see that each
[28:15] church age starts off with a praise I
[28:17] want you to read the church ages and
[28:20] compare every one on first is a praise
[28:25] second is rebuke and the third what is
[28:36] it it's the overcomer yeah so what are
[28:47] we talking about before John before you
[28:52] write of the church ages and what's to
[28:56] transpire down through time you realize
[29:02] Who I am you realize where I've come to
[29:05] that I've been more feed into the bride
[29:08] to show you how perfect she is then
[29:14] that's up like I said when we pick up
[29:18] the pattern of the church edges you'll
[29:19] see it fall right in line he praises he
[29:22] rebukes in any types of away
[29:27] that'll be the whole scope if you'll
[29:30] read that with just those thoughts in
[29:32] mind you'll learn a lot about it that
[29:36] before he ever even it and there's a
[29:38] quote wrote around said something /
[29:41] phrasing like this but he said see there
[29:43] he said before he says anything to him
[29:47] he said he's gonna withhold that for a
[29:50] while he says he's gonna withhold that
[29:56] rebuking for a while you know why
[30:01] because he realized we're just babies
[30:03] and we need a little bit of petting and
[30:07] pampering and everything you know
[30:11] because we're babies in Christ all right
[30:16] now see then you'll see what I've been
[30:20] driving out where I am or Who I am where
[30:24] I am he morph into the bride and then
[30:30] take her totally out of this situation
[30:34] there's an overcomer so you get the
[30:39] point
[30:41] see he praises no let me say that again
[30:48] where you make sure you get it he tailed
[30:50] who he is
[30:51] then he tells where he went now do you
[30:55] think that he's gonna lose anybody in
[30:57] the church ages are the writing of the
[30:59] book from then on when he's already step
[31:02] told you how perfect you are yeah but I
[31:06] ain't perfect brother though we're not
[31:08] looking at what we think if we look at
[31:12] what we think we will never make it
[31:16] we're looking at what he says okay now
[31:21] we might wind up in trouble a lot of
[31:25] times we remember what I mean by that is
[31:28] he told Israel he said you would be down
[31:32] there for hundred years right but he
[31:37] said you'll be brought out by a strong
[31:40] hand
[31:42] okay because of Israel's rebelling not
[31:52] following God they were down there 430
[31:56] years God didn't lie he just kind of
[32:06] wanted them to know a little bit about
[32:07] it in other words I told you to be down
[32:10] to four hundred years we said because of
[32:12] your rebellion to refuse me when I
[32:14] walked on the scene with Moses and you
[32:16] gonna get thirty more years which would
[32:18] probably work out to be 40 but you know
[32:20] it's just just I'm just quoting the
[32:22] scriptures that they were there the
[32:24] extra time because of their unbelief and
[32:28] they believed Moses when he come down
[32:30] they wouldn't have been there the rest
[32:32] of that time he was right on time Moses
[32:37] came exactly
[32:38] he didn't come 430 years he came exactly
[32:43] to the 400 years and says let's go then
[32:47] they said well bleed right said okay God
[32:56] says I'll just take Moses I can't keep
[32:57] him out here while he said when you get
[33:01] through playing around you get ready to
[33:03] get out of here well you don't want I
[33:05] love God for that he gives us choices
[33:10] and ways and done and because that we
[33:12] don't jump on the bandwagon and take off
[33:15] in a hurry the way he wants to go
[33:16] sometimes he just lets things roll well
[33:23] he knows yeah he knows he knew that he
[33:28] was going to give them 30 more years
[33:32] he wasn't pulling nothing over on God
[33:35] and he didn't lie about putting them
[33:38] there for hundred years they stayed for
[33:39] a year and they got 30 more because of
[33:42] rebelling I kind of think that's where
[33:45] we're at church about 30 40 years past
[33:47] the time of passing the prophet and all
[33:50] of the things and because of our
[33:52] rebellion his reason we
[33:53] here whether you like that or not that
[33:56] don't matter to me cuz I'm talking about
[33:58] me just as well as I'm talking about you
[34:01] why are we here 50 years after the going
[34:04] of a profit to see where they will stay
[34:07] with the order that to see where there
[34:12] will stay with the word when everything
[34:14] else goes wrong now you'll see that when
[34:18] you watch it and see how it does
[34:22] because first know he's showing you how
[34:28] perfect you are for your ring start okay
[34:31] now I hope that we'll finally dwell into
[34:34] you that he doesn't tell you how bad you
[34:37] are and then tell you how good you are
[34:40] he tells you how good you are then tell
[34:44] how really bad we are because of the way
[34:46] we go and then he comes back and tell us
[34:49] how good we are again okay now you
[34:54] following me so John in writing looks it
[35:06] is somewhere around 80 95 96 throw 93 95
[35:12] and he's writing and he writes of what
[35:18] has happening but his main basis is what
[35:22] is happening and he speaks of a future
[35:27] to come now swallow yeah everybody ready
[35:36] you know one of these days are not going
[35:39] and they're the lysed overcomers don't
[35:40] overcome and you swallow enough to take
[35:45] that in one of these days the last
[35:48] overcomer is going to overcome now we
[35:52] know what the prophet said right it's
[35:55] not what we overcome right he said it's
[36:03] how we overcome now how do we overcome
[36:08] by being in him all right no so follow
[36:14] that doubted if they'll pick it up if
[36:20] they will go to I didn't give them this
[36:22] but I didn't intend to pick the thought
[36:25] that far go to chapter 2 of Revelation
[36:28] if you will brother Joe and never hurts
[36:31] back there and let us read it because I
[36:35] want you to read it I want you to see
[36:38] what I'm talking about that first he's
[36:42] going to praise now before it ever takes
[36:46] place we think I'm how bad to lady we'll
[36:50] see in church ages you know God looks
[36:53] down that far and said I don't see
[36:54] nothing now come on is it right he said
[37:03] okay but I got to rebuke you I said that
[37:07] I don't got left you so look at what it
[37:09] says unto the Angel of the Church of
[37:13] Ephesus write these things saith he that
[37:16] holdeth the seven stars in his right
[37:18] hand who walked in the midst of the
[37:20] seven golden Kenneth it this is who I am
[37:24] same point now grab for the longest who
[37:28] I am I'm the one doing if I'm doing this
[37:30] what I do I move into the church form
[37:34] alright now what I know thy works and
[37:40] thy labour and thy patience and how that
[37:45] thou canst not by them which are evil
[37:48] thou has tried them which say they are
[37:50] apostles and are not and it's found in
[37:54] lockers now that's bragging go to
[37:58] remember how the prophets you'll read
[38:00] the church age book you'll get all of
[38:01] these and I'd invite you to do that
[38:03] reading church age with the you know the
[38:06] part we're talking so what is he doing
[38:11] he's praising him
[38:14] and telling what they're doing and what
[38:18] they're doing is right
[38:20] and he doesn't bring out the wrong then
[38:26] he'll do it missed a second now but when
[38:30] he starts out he don't see they're wrong
[38:34] he bears with him I'll bring you that
[38:39] quote from the Prophet I got it so
[38:41] you're laying here at home one he said
[38:44] see that he said God just don't jump in
[38:47] there and start hammering away at him he
[38:49] said he understands you know what he
[38:54] understands he understands and he's
[38:57] gonna have to rebuke him he understands
[38:59] that they're going to go away from the
[39:01] word now here's the point I want you to
[39:04] remember because I've heard this argued
[39:06] a lot of people think that there's and
[39:09] there is there's two points in the
[39:12] church ages that are true and a false
[39:14] vine now I've heard this talk about
[39:17] believers in this message that the true
[39:20] bride was not rebuked in the ages it was
[39:24] the false that was reviewed I don't
[39:27] agree
[39:27] brother Branham don't agree so it's all
[39:29] right whether you agree or not that's
[39:32] alright I'm just telling you that's not
[39:35] the way it goes all right but listen
[39:38] okay he's bragging on wouldn't it be
[39:42] something to realize that God would send
[39:44] this letter to me and you say I know
[39:48] that works my labor not patience and
[39:53] said look you can't bar them with your
[39:56] evil now remember in here in Europe you
[39:59] brother Brennan said the Christian life
[40:02] in the church in Ephesus was not like it
[40:04] is today he said it was based upon the
[40:08] Word of God right now look and that's
[40:15] tried them which say they are apostles
[40:16] how do you try somebody says their
[40:19] apostle prophet tells you in the church
[40:22] in Syria he said you try and by the word
[40:27] well who gives you a right to try
[40:30] anybody ain't trying to just quote the
[40:34] word you don't have to worry about it
[40:37] it's quote the word you don't have to
[40:42] argue and nobody or whatever you know
[40:44] somebody comes down and said well we
[40:46] believe this here so where's it in the
[40:48] word or did the Prophet say that yeah
[40:54] because you're trying the Apostles and
[40:57] proving it wrong and or not and has
[40:59] found them liars who's a liar according
[41:05] to the scripture the liar is he that
[41:07] denied that Jesus Christ has come in the
[41:09] flesh
[41:10] he's an antichrist the denies that Jesus
[41:14] Christ is come in the flesh not was or
[41:18] are is right now in this flesh all right
[41:21] now look he goes on to verse three and
[41:25] hath born and that's patience and for my
[41:30] name's sake labored and hath not find it
[41:35] no look how wonderful God feels about
[41:41] his church I want you to read that for
[41:44] each church age as you read it because
[41:46] you'll find the first verse of each
[41:48] church age or the second verse these
[41:50] church age will be an automatic praise
[41:53] of God they don't matter what agent it
[41:56] is there's be a praise from God but then
[42:03] he has to face reality and then he has
[42:09] to rebuke why because we're guilty so
[42:14] look verse four pulling on that
[42:17] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[42:21] thee because thou hast left thy first
[42:25] love now the Prophet said leaving the
[42:28] first love was the church leaving the
[42:31] Word of God yeah but I swear I think
[42:35] it's just the false vine that left the
[42:37] word well
[42:40] if it's a false vine that left the word
[42:44] and not rebuking the true vine worth any
[42:47] salvation for the truth they don't need
[42:49] it is that what you're saying as you're
[42:53] saying that the true vine don't need no
[42:55] salvation don't need no deliver it says
[42:59] don't lead no is that what you're saying
[43:01] come on folks wake up and get a reality
[43:04] about it no we didn't whip our kids just
[43:10] because we we know that with mom and
[43:12] Daddy
[43:13] is when they needed it right then that's
[43:19] when they got it was when they needed it
[43:22] not just because I was dad here it's
[43:26] when they need it
[43:28] but remember chastening had always been
[43:31] with one thing do you explain this one
[43:34] to me
[43:35] how can he chasing with nail scars in
[43:40] his hand I love that one that's always
[43:43] been something in my heart about that
[43:45] little point because if he's got nail
[43:49] prints in his hands that was hurting
[43:54] how can he spank you hard that you get
[44:01] what I'm saying
[44:07] listen nevertheless I have somewhat
[44:10] against thee because thou hast left thy
[44:12] first love now I've got a rebuke because
[44:16] of what you've done
[44:18] alright remember therefore from whence
[44:22] thou art fallen now if it wouldn't the
[44:26] true bride then what are you gonna do
[44:27] with falling it would be no fall into it
[44:29] right so just forget all of that
[44:31] somebody call himself I think it was the
[44:33] false vine that went away and the true
[44:35] we know the folks Brian went away but
[44:37] the true vine did too I know I've had
[44:39] this problem with people that believed
[44:42] it and tried to present it here then
[44:45] brother Branham said that the church
[44:47] made her worst mistake when they went to
[44:50] Nicaea he said they had no right of
[44:54] going down there we'll see people thanks
[44:59] well it wasn't a true pride that went
[45:00] there well then water down there far why
[45:04] was they doing why are you going to
[45:05] rebuke oh yeah okay you know remember
[45:08] that fall from whence thou art fallen
[45:09] and repent and do the first works and
[45:15] what's the first works a better way to
[45:18] say that do the first word get back to
[45:20] the word right or else I will come unto
[45:26] thee quickly and will remove thy
[45:29] candlestick out of his place except thou
[45:33] repent now if it wasn't a true one that
[45:37] went off and whose get it alright listen
[45:43] then watch him what he starts back the
[45:46] other way
[45:48] now come owner you followed my point and
[45:51] then follow it through these church age
[45:53] first is a praise for what they are what
[45:56] they've done and how they stayed with
[45:58] the Word of God how they've been through
[46:01] all of these things then he'll rebuke
[46:04] them in that age for what they've done
[46:08] but then he starts right back to
[46:12] praising
[46:18] remember therefore from whence thou art
[46:20] fallen and repent do the first works
[46:22] over or else I'll come unto thee quickly
[46:24] and move that candlestick out of his
[46:26] place except thou repent but this thou
[46:29] hast that thou hatest the deeds of the
[46:34] Nicolaitans which also hate now what
[46:42] about he just rebuked them for falling
[46:45] away from the word because that was the
[46:49] point who was doing was falling away
[46:50] from the word now he's praising them
[46:53] because they have some things right
[46:57] you know God he's mindful of all of our
[47:00] things he knows what we're doing but he
[47:05] knows why we do it
[47:10] he bears with us
[47:19] but this thou hast that I hate us the
[47:22] deeds of the Nicolaitans which all shall
[47:24] hate now what's the naiton atlanteans
[47:27] conquer the laity now you tell me that
[47:32] don't fit today I'm gonna laugh in your
[47:35] face if you don't think this message
[47:39] preachers is doing that now I'm telling
[47:42] you that's a good joke right oh there's
[47:49] always been that conquer the lay it to
[47:51] you right listen but look what he gets
[47:57] to he that hath an ear let him hear what
[48:03] the spirit saith unto the churches all
[48:06] of them churches plural not just one all
[48:08] them both true and false and for every
[48:11] age same thing
[48:13] to him that overcometh how do we
[48:19] overcome
[48:23] by being in Jesus Christ let me put it
[48:27] this way by realizing he is praised and
[48:33] proud of his people but sometimes he has
[48:38] to rebuke right are you that way were
[48:42] your children you're proud of them very
[48:49] proud of what they're doing and the ways
[48:51] they are with sometimes you got to
[48:52] rebuke but I like the rest of it with
[48:57] all long-suffering and doctrine I always
[49:06] miss the point when most of preachers
[49:09] was hammering us to death back Gardner
[49:11] sixties and no like that in seventies is
[49:16] beating us for everything he moved you
[49:19] know and but what I wanted him to do was
[49:24] rebuke me with doctrine cuz that's what
[49:30] the Bible says reprove rebuke all
[49:32] long-suffering and doctrine you realize
[49:36] by preaching the truth to people you're
[49:38] first off you're gonna make them mad
[49:43] don't grin or laugh at me and say that
[49:47] I'm wrong just swallow and say Amen
[49:49] first thing you're gonna do when you get
[49:51] rebuked is get mad
[49:53] maybe not fightin mad right
[49:58] just close because you're upset hey I'm
[50:06] talking about me that's what I'm talking
[50:07] about you but it's nice sometimes to say
[50:11] something and you look at people and go
[50:12] there's they're grinning anyway you say
[50:19] oh I just said something that didn't go
[50:22] over right Danny quit smiling started
[50:26] frowning so I gotta find out what he's
[50:28] upset about right come on
[50:34] pull it back up now - what did hit watch
[50:37] this because what's the point
[50:39] first here abuse I mean first he he he
[50:43] praises next he rebukes then he comes
[50:46] right back to praising remember this is
[50:51] his children he that hath an ear let him
[50:58] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[51:00] churches
[51:00] to him that overcometh I will give to
[51:04] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[51:07] midst of the paradise of God a per taker
[51:11] of the word of God each age we will
[51:17] relate to that point
[51:19] each overcomer gets the revelation of
[51:24] the Word of God
[51:27] you just think where you come from not
[51:31] just saying let's be sensual just think
[51:34] where you come from you know I mean you
[51:39] come from Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[51:40] Pinnacle's whatever our brand of minds
[51:43] after getting the message and just think
[51:49] of what God has been doing for you and
[51:52] me but he expects us to be a little
[51:59] overcome you know overcomer to me now
[52:01] now listen to my explanation so I know
[52:04] what it means there's no one to just
[52:06] give you the definition we can't
[52:08] overcome it's him overcoming in us but
[52:11] you know what we've got to make
[52:13] ourselves available right now here is an
[52:21] overcomer one who comes in here and
[52:27] never ends till he gets here
[52:30] now that's an overcomer right
[52:39] but the most wonderful thing I could
[52:42] think of is the fact of what I've tried
[52:47] to say and we'll keep saying it over and
[52:50] over you may get tired of hearing me
[52:55] State thing but keep listening John I
[53:01] want you to know who I am what we start
[53:05] on anything because I want you to know
[53:08] who's dealing with you who's talking
[53:12] with you who's doing these things and I
[53:13] want you to know I'm the only one that
[53:15] can do what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
[53:19] praise you then I'm gonna rebuke you and
[53:26] then I'm gonna honor that by coming to
[53:30] giving you one of mine let's see how if
[53:34] I quoted the Prophet I'll read it later
[53:36] he said ever church age has a right to
[53:41] part of the deity of Jesus Christ one
[53:45] exists even a Sevenfold glorious person
[53:47] you know think about it he rebukes as I
[53:55] said wanna go with nail-scarred hands he
[54:00] don't throw us out the door now he
[54:06] forgives us
[54:09] but do we forgive each other come on
[54:16] what is that - the overcomer I will
[54:21] grant eat of the Tree of Life now listen
[54:26] to this statement letter Brennan said
[54:28] whatever each overcomer of the age gets
[54:32] the next church age gets that Plus
[54:35] thirst the third church age gets the
[54:41] same as the first church age but with
[54:43] the second age and the Nexus you see
[54:45] where we're standing you see where we
[54:50] stand
[54:51] we get every one of them why because
[54:55] we're the lies we're the ones to carry
[55:00] the burden in the heat of the day and
[55:01] the problem we're the ones that
[55:04] everybody is dependent upon because
[55:08] without us they can't be made perfect
[55:10] I'll find that but it's remember
[55:12] whatever this age gets the next age gets
[55:16] an overcomer promise and that he just
[55:18] gets that right along with it
[55:19] in the next age gets theirs and you just
[55:22] get that right along with it what about
[55:24] when it comes for the rate of our age we
[55:27] get whatever one of them back that we
[55:30] can read that that have to write to the
[55:34] Tree of Life we can read that and know
[55:39] that's going to come to me in this age
[55:45] because as I said this is the age where
[55:49] time and eternity is going to meet know
[55:55] that when I get into that I think about
[56:00] this profit is where he came then why
[56:04] came the way it did tore this profit
[56:08] stands at a most wonderful position
[56:14] because he brings all the word what are
[56:21] you listening pull it back up and let's
[56:23] get to life's part now to him that
[56:25] overcometh so what's the first praising
[56:27] them for the things that they've done
[56:29] and how they've stood with the word and
[56:30] done what they've done in a horrible
[56:32] situation read it read of those things
[56:37] back guard it was taking place but then
[56:40] what does it do and it's that he that
[56:44] excuse come at ya and under there he
[56:46] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[56:48] spirit saith unto the churches
[56:50] to him that overcometh will I give to
[56:53] eat of the Tree of Life which is in the
[56:56] midst of the paradise of God
[57:04] he's going to give us a revelation of
[57:09] his deity read you second sir change you
[57:15] see what you get and remember you get
[57:18] everyone a third Church age for church
[57:21] age field Church a seventh church aging
[57:24] hurts everything what a wonderful God we
[57:32] serve so what about thinking of it
[57:42] because there he stands I had him to
[57:44] bring but I got where I'll get away from
[57:47] all that now on seeming like try to just
[57:49] talk to you John saw one locking the son
[57:56] of man standing in the midst of seven
[57:58] golden candlesticks brother run City
[58:00] showed him in his glorified state now he
[58:07] he's glorified he glorifies me and you
[58:12] but remember by him coming in you you're
[58:16] glorifying him well how can we glorify
[58:21] by walking in the word I just seeing
[58:26] what the word says about us and if you
[58:29] don't catch nothing else out of the
[58:30] whole thing the whole series catch this
[58:36] before he ever starts to book of
[58:38] revelations he tells you how perfect
[58:43] everything is it shows you perfect let's
[58:53] see if we still to fall back what but
[58:55] we're not perfect our perfection comes
[59:02] to Jesus Christ the only way we can
[59:06] never be perfect to be in Jesus Christ
[59:07] it didn't come through what we do or
[59:10] don't do but could you think about it
[59:17] that before he tells anything of the
[59:21] church agent he tells you how perfect
[59:24] the church ages are and to prove that's
[59:30] right that my points right you read
[59:33] every Church age and you get home and
[59:35] see if he didn't start off ever Church
[59:38] age with a praise he doesn't wait until
[59:47] it's over with and then prays he praises
[59:50] because he he knows the beginning in the
[59:52] ending he knows what we're gonna do
[59:55] he knew how long we'd be here after the
[59:58] Prophet left
[59:59] he's not worried about it right and
[1:00:07] what's he doing waiting on me and you to
[1:00:09] realize what he has already done not
[1:00:16] what he's going to do oh one of these
[1:00:18] days that we're Daniel when he David he
[1:00:21] no no no no he's already done here but
[1:00:28] don't forget now I will repeat it and
[1:00:30] I'll repeat it every service he tells
[1:00:35] the church how perfect it is for he ever
[1:00:37] starts telling the church ages anything
[1:00:40] about them then he takes these church
[1:00:45] age and he praises them he rebukes them
[1:00:49] and he doesn't lose a one because he
[1:00:53] comes right to the overcomer and gets
[1:01:00] everything straight what do we got to
[1:01:03] worry about
[1:01:08] while we worried why is it a problem why
[1:01:12] we why are we worried about the age and
[1:01:15] the time and what's doing you can't do
[1:01:18] nothing about it anyway you doesn't hurt
[1:01:20] the profits it adjourn Abraham Lincoln
[1:01:22] never office or something like that in
[1:01:24] the country can't pull this thing out
[1:01:29] yeah with brother Dale you make it look
[1:01:31] like it's dude ha did you there's a
[1:01:34] whole lot more I can read to about the
[1:01:35] profit and what he said you know if you
[1:01:38] won't dad I just try my best to get you
[1:01:41] to see what he thinks of you well
[1:01:47] brother Dale what does God think of me
[1:01:48] he thinks you're perfect because that's
[1:01:57] what he made you and see he's always
[1:02:05] been that come over there he's always
[1:02:08] been there he's always there but he
[1:02:14] tells us before we ever start the book
[1:02:23] is already written they will be a bride
[1:02:28] in glory because the Bible says it well
[1:02:34] all we gotta do is believe we're part of
[1:02:36] it and then for heaven's sake to be one
[1:02:40] thing that was trying to explain in
[1:02:41] there the reason Israel was down there
[1:02:43] 30 years was because of them not because
[1:02:46] of God
[1:02:48] it was their stubbornness it put him
