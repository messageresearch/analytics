========================================

[Music] and say to you again good morning good morning I think we're live so like I said we're going to do something a little different this morning um this is the program that I use to keep my notes in so I want to just kind of go through the book of Ephesians starting at chapter one of course we're not we're not going to have time to get through the whole thing but kind of go through maybe the first chapter with the thought in mind being full Redemption CU I I you know you sometimes you it seems like and maybe this is a little bit critical attitude I don't want to be critical but it seems like many times people in the message don't fully understand well the book of Ephesians they don't fully understand full Redemption what's taking place that they look at it as as U we believe the message and we're we we're going to get born again and and then beyond that um if you say anything then you you have a this is going to sound critical but I I it's almost it's the truth and you know how I preach sometimes I just I just lay it out there and right and uh you can't it's almost like you can't be critical you can't say what you really believe yeah or else uh you have a big head and and so forth and everything but you know brother Brandon I was reading where he was he was breaking down the book of Ephesians to this little group of people that he was ministering to and he said this this book is special because you can't preach it you can't talk about it to people that aren't born again it's not for people out there that that are and it's not for new Christians not for somebody that's just now found out about the gospel and just barely coming in and just now hearing about uh being baptized and different things like that it's it's for somebody that's getting rooted in the word and is born again and is ready to begin growing I'm get myself in the frame here so the the book of Ephesians is special right and and I I I I wish that that people all around the message was really spend the the amount of time studying the Bible to compare back with what brother brand actually said to compare to join them up so that they get the real essence of what the message is talking about and and read what the book of Ephesians says and and maybe this would be kind of a bold statement but almost the book of Ephesians is kind of a proof to you that you are born again because when you can read the book of Ephesians and it's coming alive to you and you can understand the things that it talks about adoption and how uh how that you have to grow and how that you're when you're a baby born in Christ that you're not in you God can't have full confidence in you that you're going to do the right thing and and the things that he wrote about uh kind of looking forward to the son of man that God will be revealed in flesh and what he's doing he's building a body and and all those different things and then and then the last chapter talking about how that the the a man and his wife types Christ in the church and and and you know even so many many people look at that as kind of like a a man is greater than a woman but if you really have a real true understanding of what that's speaking of that that out of uh Adam's side came his bride and out of Christ's side came his bride and the bride is supposed to be join airs with Christ and and it comes even that God is unfolding himself into a greater revelation of himself it's not that the man is beating up the wife or anything when to get a real true picture of that maybe read the song with Solomon and you'll get a real true picture of what what God is really trying to speak to us about about how he thinks of us and what his his mind is toward his bride so make sure I got the chapter right I'm going to start off with um where the Ephesians Church started and brother brand he always referenced this a lot of times about how many people were in the Ephesian church and but you can take it back to the Bible and prove the things that he said and so maybe I I throw this out there too as is that um I I I I almost would rather somebody question what I believe and go back and prove it by the Bible like you know how brother R said whenever an angel came and told him told him or showed him scripture he'd go back and prove it and of course that angel wouldn't be upset ministers aren't upset if you if you maybe question what they're going to what they're saying enough to go back or care about what they're saying enough to go back and prove it by the Bible and uh you know brother Dale's going to have I believe he's going to have another questions an answer this morning maybe so if he does and anything anything comes in your mind that you hear this morning that maybe has a question feel free to it ain't going to hurt my feelings if you if you uh pop up with a question or whatever cuz questions are for the edifying of the church right and we're all supposed to be working together to build up the body of Christ so that we can go into Rapture so a minister can't read your mind right but they don't know what you're thinking but you tell them exactly and I I I think that's one of one of my little stressors is you know you preach a sermon and then people kind of gather around and they and they won't tell you you can tell they don't quite agree with you and they'll say well I can tell you've been study or something like that but but but something something's still off though just just tell or if you want tell me then uh and I'm not speaking to anybody here or anything I'm just I'm just kind of throwing this out but tell tell brother Dale or or to ask somebody if if something don't seem right somebody in Authority exactly right exactly thank you sister you like like when the disciples were sitting around and and and Jesus said who do you say that I the son of man am because if you can find somebody that answer that question right somebody that knows what they're talking about you're eyes sister you don't want to just ask somebody anybody but you want to find somebody that really knows what they're talking about like our pastor yes but uh you know lot you say well I don't agree with you well if you don't agree with somebody you should be able to show them in the Bible and the mess where they're wrong don't that I don't agree with you you're wrong because that don't mean nothing because all of our conversation is based upon the word it's not based upon feelings or emotions I feel like you're you're saying something right I I have it it hurt my feelings well all those things are great but our our our whole conversation our whole Christian experience is based upon the word of God so you should be able absolutely right you should be able to say well this this this scripture right here says this and it seems to contradict what you say or brother brand said this over here and it seems to contradict what you say and then you have some some kind of basis uh that you can you can have a conversation about so that kind of took a little detour but that's all right so Acts 19 is where the Ephesians Church started and it came to pass that while Apollo was a COR Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and this is one of the themes through brother Brown's Ministry now we say we say you reive the Holy Ghost many many people you know will say you reive the Holy Ghost when you believe but now let me explain that I I think it's sometimes it's helpful to kind of uh reiterate things go through things over and over and over again because that's how how we grow and many of you might have heard all these things over and over again but it helps to kind of solidify come on in bro have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe just like just like when a man and a woman gets together something germinates something the process begins to started but I ain't no baby yet have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you can say I believe that something gets started that process gets started and then that that sell those CES begin to start dividing and after a while you got that little that little embil with with the kicking member the kicking limbs like brother BR said uh it it's it's still not alive yet the life hasn't come into that into that child and just like a Believer start they might be hopping around and and yelling in church and things but yet the the child hasn't come forth and that's what we're looking for have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe but then one day that baby comes forth and there you can hold it in your arms and you can rock it and the spirit of that child like brother R said You' be in the hospital room you can feel that presence of the life come into that child and and then that baby is born so he asked him this question have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said un him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost now how can you receive the holy ghost or how can you make any move toward God at all without hearing the word because Romans 10:14 says how can they how can they call upon him on whom they have not heard how can you how can you move anywhere that's why you got to hear the word you got to read the Bible you got to uh if first you got to come to the word you can't um can't do do anything can't make any movement toward god without hearing the word first and that's why reading the word is so important I keep stressing this to my kids all the time you you say you want the Holy Ghost and everything but you read your Bible you know you let all the and adults and everybody let things of this world get in the way of our reading the Bible and how can you how can you grow the stature of perfect man if you won't spend time with God how can you make any movement toward God toward adoption or anything any of the blessings in God if you want to spend time with it and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism then said Paul John verely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him what should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus after they heard the word then they change direction right cuz now they can go in the right direction once the word's preached and when Paul had la La his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12 and that's scripture right there the seven scriptures where uh the verse seven is where brother R he always mentioned about how the Ephesian church only had 12 people and it says all the men were about 12 maybe there were some little babies and some mothers went in there as well but that the Bible says that there were the the men were about 12 so that's a small little church and there that small little church uh in this little little set aside place was a group of people where God that they had matured to the point where where Paul could come and teach them the things that were were not just for little babies tossed about wondering if this church was right for them or this church based on their feelings and their emotions and all the different things like that but they were ready to grow up into adoption grow of course back then the Capstone had not come because uh all those things you know waiting for this day for for the for the body to be completed for the church to be finished so that all of us together could be could be represented together and go up to you know why the Capstone didn't come cuz he's waiting for you and I he it couldn't come yet because he's he's waiting for you and I to be born to believe the message to believe the gospel and all these things were things that talked about Paul talked about in in in the book of Ephesians predestination all of the these things are things that he he spoke of in in that book so now let's go on over to Ephesians and look at this and so I said earlier I got uh sometimes just the way the King James version words things it's a it makes it a little bit hard to read us but you know the more and more you read the King James version the more and more you realize it it how could it even be worded any other way and to word it a different way it just changes the way that it is put together in your mind and everything so uh just to as a help I I put the NL the New Living Translation up there and I'm not at all recommending in that and and uh sometimes just the wording they move things around a little bit it helps to understand it uh sometimes I use the Young Living Translation just kind of side by side but I always go back to the King James version except when when brother random said there's a few places where he said that they didn't translate exactly right so I just wanted to point that out just because I have that up there doesn't mean that I'm advocating that you use that at all or anything so um Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at e and to the faithful in Christ Jesus and so one thing I want to point out about this little church in Ephesus that is that these the the churches that in in Revelation the churches the church ages there was actually physical churches in Asia the Church of the Ephesians and I I think that sometimes that escapes people's mind that they they get it so much in their head that there's these Church ages the Ephesian Church age that they forget that there was an actual Church in Asia that there was actually a beran Church where they wrote letters to and they win and they and they had the same characteristics of the church ages so in this little Ephesian Church age or church it had the same characteristics that were mentioned in the about the Ephesian Church age this the characteristics they that they demonstrated and so Paul's writing this letter to the Ephesians and to the faithful in Christ Jesus so as I as I mentioned before that that this little letter to the Ephesians is not just to to to any anybody out on the street or any new Christians is to the people that are born again and ready to begin the process of growing on up and that's why you can't understand this without a booring an experience you can't really understand this without the teach to open up to you and to real real you and and seems like so many people don't are not fully grasping this that's it it it g it truly Grieves your heart to to speak to people and and they don't see what God is doing in this age and and you've got to see what God is doing in your life because that is what the seals reveal seals reveal Jesus Christ and if you are part of Christ then they reveal what God is doing in your life and you can see yourself in the word that's how John saw himself in the book and you see yourself in the book because the book is open to you and you can look into the book because you can see the Redemption the story of redemption in your own life and you can see what's go what God is doing to you you can see how God brought you through justification and sanctification and B the Holy Ghost and and how the word is being fulfilled in you and how he he is manifesting your himself in your members and in the members of the other people in your church and around you and your family and how the the gospel is being fulfilled in his bride so so let's keep going Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the Lord and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ now sinner it cannot be in Heavenly places the only way you can be in Heavenly places is by one Spirit by one baptism by one faith and then you can be in Heavenly places what are these Heavenly places that we're talking about when you get along with God and you start shouting in glory and God begins to open up your word that's Heavenly places when he takes you from Faith to Virtue that's Heavenly places he's taking you on a journey through Heavenly places from from from from glory and Glory as he opens his word so let's see I I I the way this little program works I I I brother brother Dale he's been kind of encouraging us to keep keep our make our own little concordance and record what brother R said about about different scriptures as you read your Bible so that's what I'm doing and if I click this little icon it'll tell me what brother said about Heavenly places so he said in Paradox he said what is it in Exodus the 13th chapter we read that God gave the children of Israel which was a type of the church today as they Journey naturally we're journeying in the spirit next Sunday we're taking that now remember it's all on that now how that they were went on the ground materially like this and God was with them the church is seated with Christ seated with Christ now remember God is enthone on your heart he's seting on the throne of your heart and and he's he's uh we're joined with him so we're seated together because when you get the new birth he's vulcanized his life is vulcanized with your life and it's joined together so that his life just begins to take over with you seated together in Heavenly places with all dominions under our feet yes and they had a pillar of fire a light that they followed wherever this light went they followed that light thousands of years has passed hundreds of years has went by and it's still alive a paradox let me scroll down we are assembled in Heavenly it means that the position of the believer and the position the believer comes to their position by the opening of the word that's that's what Ephesians is all about remember brother R compar compared Ephesians to the Book of Joshua how after they came over in the promised land the the Holy Spirit began to place the believer and put them into the place that they were supposed to be and Ephesians begins to place the Believer by telling them what they're supposed to do what happens after the New Birth the the end goal is not just to be born again but you begin to grow up in Christ and he begins to put you in the different places you should be to fulfill the some there's there's there fivefold Ministry there's deacons there's song leaders there's different places uh positions that have to be filled in the body of Christ and he puts everybody in that and and we're all marching toward one goal to be adopted to come into perfect obedience with him now look he says that if I'm prayed up you're prayed up or the church has prayed up and we're ready for the message and we have assembled ourselves together as Saints called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called elected set together in Heavenly places now we are heavenli in our souls our Spirits has brought us into a Heavenly atmosphere oh brother there you are a Heavenly atmosphere now think about that you know brother R said your atmosphere is your attitude toward his word word so when you get into church and and and everything in your life's up you you prayed up and and your your attitude is right and you're you meditate on on God's word it changes the atmosphere your conversation changes the atmosphere when you talk to other believers and they they're having a hard time and You Begin virtue flows out of you and you start encouraging them and saying I know that all right here we go I I know God's word says that God's able to bring you out I know God's word is able to to make this pass in your life then that sets an atmosphere it creates an atmosphere around you and and his his atmosphere is Heavenly places because your soul by the Born Again spirit is not bound to this earth anymore your soul is already redeemed your soul is in take it on up to the next level of justification where who can charge anything to God's elect who could when you look at a born- again believer they ain't no charge you can bring against their soul because they're perfect in Christ Jesus and their soul is in Heavenly places but that act that that Redemptive act has to keep on going up from the soul to the spirit and the body which is the to Wi the Redemption of the body to understand what's going to take place to change our bodies that's what the book of Ephesians is about right blessing us with what Divine Healing here's Heavenly places now he LTS them all out Heavenly places blessing us with a word Divine Healing for knowledge Revelation Visions Powers tongues interpretation wisdom knowledge all the Heavenly blessings and joy unspeakable and full of Glory every heart fill with the spirit walking together setting together in Heavenly places not one evil thought Among Us not one cigarette smoke not one short dress not one this that or the other not one evil thought nobody got anything against one another everybody speaking in love and harmony everybody with one Accord in one place and then suddenly they come from Heaven a sound like a rushing Mighty Wind there you are has blessed us with all spiritual blessings that's what happens when you're sitting in Heavenly places because God gives you access to walk Beyond the Veil like brother like Paul talked about he he's tore the the veil through so we could we could walk in and have access to all the Heavenly blessings all all all the Heavenly places places places because you're on a journey and he's taking you from one blessing to the next until we come to the final blessing Unity with God true Oneness according as he ha chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world and that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having adopt you can see my little my little my little notes Here I just I just read through I just put these little things predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now you know these these two scriptures and one two of the most controversial scriptures in all the Bible it's it's broke up churches it's broke up the predestination and and this idea that of of choosing did God choose you or did you choose him or is it a combination of the two now I got I got some quotes here I'll read in the second but that whole now let's go let's go back through history for a second and look at how Martin Luther believed this and look at how John whistle believed it and look then look at how brother R believed it choosing CH did God choose you now Martin Luther said predestination was a topic that should be avoided he said every time I start thinking about predestination I start making God do things that that almost seems evil cuz he had it in his mind that that that he he couldn't quite straighten it out he could see justification and he could see part of the scripture but there was still loose sins that needed to be tied up see and and as you keep progressing John Wesley had a little bit higher understanding of it John Wesley said if you make God to choose some people and and to to Salvation and choose other people to be lost then you make him worse than the devil because how can you stand before just God on the day of judgment and say that uh and judge them in any way because there's no there instead of judging them by the word and how they reacted to the word where they accepted the promises of God you're you're judging them by by on something that they had no part in they had no control over all they all they were was just kind of a a a a kind of a leaf floating down the stream and and then we come on up to to brother brandom who kind of put the put the thoughts together and and set us right down that razor edge of his word to show us exactly what's happening right and I know this is just a huge topic I'm just kind of going through here on the Fly I don't I didn't have any really prepared thoughts or anything this is good when did God choose us when did God choose you that's got the Holy Ghost when did he choose you before the foundation of the world by his for knowledge he foresaw you and know that you would love him and before there was a foundation of the world he chose you and sent Jesus that he might be the propitiation of your sins to call you to reconciliation to himself to love oh wish we had just a few more minutes time we have the same right today in the church he said in the sardian church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the book of life this is the record God ha given us eternal life and this life is in his son and he that hath the son hath life eternal and he that hath not the son hath not life eternal and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that great Royal Sea Jesus Christ was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing it itself in multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because by Spirit they are original now see this talk goes all the way back to Genesis 12627 where there was a man uh that came forth manifested and and and you couldn't really understand it but then that man was put in Jesus Christ and in him were all the attributes we were identified in him like brother talked about how when he walked down the shores of Galilee we were identified in him we we were in him when he died when we were in him when he rose and all the things here we go again Hallelujah so when he when his when his side was pierced and out from his side came came the the water and the blood and then the spirit left him just like out of his side out of the side of the Ark of the Covenant was the law of the tablets and they would take that out and read it and and expose what was in the side of the Arc of the Covenant the Lord the the law and the Commandments and so that man everything that was in him on the as he walked the shores of Galilee he made a way for all that to be expressed back in people so if you were part of him if you were in him he knew that you would accept it one day and so he had it prepared and God never has a new thought he never has a new idea so he always knew you would accept it and by that way he could predestinate it he would have it waiting for you ready for you and even so much as he said brother said that he bred this one to that one and and it all down to to to get you to get you here so that you would be here waiting and ready to receive it that just doesn't that just blow your mind and you know one thing Martin Luther said that I just really love is predestination if you even if you don't understand it clearly predestination was was meant to give the believer Comfort right even if you can't quite wrap your mind around it believe that you were predestinated in him God always knew that you would believe it so he had the word waiting for you and that and that gives the believer Comfort having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will unto the adoption of children now you know we know adoption goes through many different stages the first stage of adoption is that you you you are just some nobody out in the world and just like just like how natural adoption Works he you go out and to the adoption agencies there's a lot of different kids that you don't know from anybody and and you look through them and you make you you make your selection however way you that solation works it might be that you like the way this child looks or it might be you do some background research and and and all those different things come to pass that you select a child and you adopt him into your family well the way this works is that the the the spiritual adoption is that there's a a barbarian out there like like how Paul used to describe it somebody that don't know anything about God but they hear the word preached and then they come they come running to the gospel they and they're adopted into the family but that's not the end of the story you keep growing on up until until you come to the manifestation of the sons of God which is uh a period down through the church age history and a period in your own personal life because what God is doing through the church ages he's also got to do in your own personal life that's what that's what escapes so many people is that the story of the son of man the story of the Seven Church ages the story of the stature of perfect man is not just through the church ages but it's the Redemption story in your own personal life and that's what's being revealed in the seals the seals reveal time periods and histories but they also reveal what's God is doing in your own personal life and you got to see when God when you see full redemption in your life full Redemption is what we're talking about full Redemption then we're going to be we're going to go in the Rapture and that's what verse seven is about and I'm going to end on this and whom we have let me turn on my inner linear and I'm G click on this word you can see this is the original Greek word for that that word Redemption and down here you can see kind of the translation full Redemption is the is the meaning the underlying meaning of that word in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace what is full Redemption when your soul is redeemed it's absolutely perfect when your spirit is perfectly in line with this with with God's word then you're coming even more and more toward true Oneness with God right but when your body is changed that is the full Redemption for you for your body what about when the world is changed when God through through water and his blood dripping on the earth and then by fire purges the Earth so that he can bring in a New Jerusalem bring in a new city and make all things new then that will be the full Redemption for the Earth so God's doing something that that he might be all in all everything will be returned back to its original condition and that's the mystery that Paul is talking about the mystery that God would reveal himself fully in Jesus Christ and then that God would reveal himself fully in his bride so fully that the Saints would Rise Up from the dead and his whole body would be present on the earth at once and then all together we'll go and meet him in the air and and then come back after the tribulation and and rest for a thousand years and then God will Purge off of the battle of go and may God all the fire all the Earth with the Holy Fire and and and restore all things back and I'm going to stop right there preach it brother [Music]
