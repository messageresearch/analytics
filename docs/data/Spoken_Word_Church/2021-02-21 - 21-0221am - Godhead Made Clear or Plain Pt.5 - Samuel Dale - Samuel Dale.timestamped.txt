[14:08] that we have a time that we can
[14:10] call upon you that we can take a little

[14:35] we crawl out for all of them lord

[14:44] that you wouldn't be there to take care
[14:46] of it so we depend upon that
[14:48] and we ask you to just bless now as we
[14:50] read your word
[14:51] and talk about you we ask you to just
[14:54] bless and guide
[14:55] each thing he's thought the points we
[14:58] try to make
[14:59] may it all be for you in jesus name amen
[15:05] matthew 28
[15:10] verse 16.
[15:13] when the eleven disciples went away into
[15:16] galilee
[15:17] into a mountain where jesus
[15:20] had appointed them and when they saw him
[15:23] they worshiped him but some doubt it
[15:26] and jesus came and spake unto them
[15:29] saying
[15:30] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[15:33] in earth
[15:34] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[15:38] baptizing them in the name of the father
[15:42] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[15:44] teaching them to observe
[15:45] all things whatsoever i have commanded
[15:48] you
[15:48] and lo i am with you always even unto
[15:52] the end
[15:53] of the world you may be seated now
[15:55] remember this is after the resurrection
[16:00] so it is put to where
[16:03] all power
[16:06] he didn't say that back down through the
[16:07] time because
[16:09] you know there were things having to be
[16:12] made manifest
[16:13] in ways and like i've always said he was
[16:15] born lord to christ
[16:17] he was born the savior but he was not
[16:20] the healer
[16:21] he couldn't do that as a child so you
[16:24] have to wait until things comes into
[16:26] being
[16:26] and then after you come into the uh
[16:31] times of their of the river jordan and
[16:33] then you see the anointing came on him
[16:35] that
[16:36] made him the anointed messiah and then
[16:39] he was crucified and then he comes forth
[16:41] and says
[16:42] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[16:44] in earth all right
[16:45] so then it's all gathered into that
[16:48] point
[16:49] and uh i hope this series parts or
[16:52] thoughts has been
[16:54] some to help you to understand the
[16:55] godhead because
[16:57] that's my point i i want us to see
[17:00] the godhead but to see the godhead
[17:02] correctly
[17:03] because like i've always said we say uh
[17:06] you know
[17:06] oneness doctrine is uh you know
[17:12] the people thinking that jesus was the
[17:14] final immorphy
[17:15] i don't believe that i believe the bride
[17:17] of jesus christ
[17:19] is the final morphe for the gentile
[17:22] dispensation
[17:23] all right now it's him in us
[17:27] it's not us no it's him in
[17:30] us manifesting himself and making
[17:34] it known all right then trying to hold a
[17:36] point to
[17:37] where you can follow it and understand
[17:40] you know that we
[17:41] did in a couple of services talking
[17:43] about
[17:45] that god has always had a body
[17:49] he's never been without a body all right
[17:52] back before time ever began
[17:54] back in eternities et cetera or whatever
[17:57] uh
[17:57] he had a body you might have to call
[17:59] that a theophany or whatever
[18:01] but don't worry about it it's still a
[18:03] body and like i
[18:05] i tried to emphasize last week in the
[18:08] basis of
[18:09] the fact of that theophany body is way
[18:11] in a more powerful or
[18:13] real or whatever words you want to use
[18:17] than these natural bodies that we live
[18:19] in now
[18:20] so then it shouldn't be any problem to
[18:23] say that god has a body
[18:26] you know that shouldn't well i just
[18:27] don't see that god has a body
[18:30] well you know what are you looking at
[18:33] see if there was a theophany body back
[18:36] there before the world ever begun
[18:40] you know anything then that's more real
[18:42] than we are
[18:43] that's more powerful than we are that's
[18:46] the part that the power is in
[18:48] is the revealed word of understanding
[18:51] where we're at
[18:52] in things and that's what we've tried to
[18:54] to uh
[18:56] show you and to make manifest
[18:59] the point to where that we are the bride
[19:02] of jesus christ
[19:04] we're the last in morphe to the gentile
[19:06] dispensation we're the life's form
[19:09] that god is to take in this dispensation
[19:12] to the gentiles then he'll turn to the
[19:14] jews
[19:15] and then more for himself to them and
[19:18] that's wonderful
[19:19] because we can we can have a part of
[19:22] thinking about that hey
[19:25] if we are part of god and we believe
[19:29] that we are and if god is not complete
[19:30] without us
[19:32] well then when he goes to israel he's
[19:35] going to have to explain the bride
[19:37] he won't have to that will be his joy
[19:41] as to explain it and to me then what i
[19:44] like about it i don't think those jews
[19:47] when they get the message of what has
[19:49] happened and how they've turned down
[19:51] god and all like that and what took
[19:53] place you know and uh
[19:55] they weep they separate and go on set
[19:58] they don't get
[19:59] mad and hateful and well we were look we
[20:02] we're the bride no they forfeited their
[20:06] rights of being that we are the bride of
[20:09] christ
[20:09] we didn't uh make ourselves that
[20:12] he chose that to be that away and and
[20:15] you know
[20:16] in that form of walking in it but just
[20:19] remember now
[20:20] god has always had a body
[20:24] whether you would want to call it a
[20:26] theophany or anything like that
[20:28] remember it's more real than we are
[20:31] all right but then to remember one thing
[20:35] as i was trying to say now
[20:38] in this dispensation we are the body
[20:42] of jesus christ all right
[20:45] and that's being that body then you know
[20:48] that's wonderful to be
[20:50] in the day and the hour so let's just
[20:52] start reading a few of the things
[20:54] if i can to try to get through these
[20:55] notes but i wish you would if i'm
[20:58] i'm serious i've always tried to preach
[21:01] the godhead and believing it
[21:03] of one true and living god and seeing it
[21:05] coming all the way down going all the
[21:06] way through
[21:07] the dispensations and then winding up
[21:09] even after we are here
[21:11] and we leave in the rapture he's still
[21:13] going to be revealing himself
[21:16] to the jews and getting all that said
[21:19] and even when we get into eternity
[21:23] i think in the millennium he'll be there
[21:26] and we'll he can be talking to us and
[21:28] bring but even after that on into
[21:30] eternities
[21:32] all the way through then he'll still be
[21:34] revealing himself
[21:38] but the thing of it is he'll be
[21:40] revealing himself to people that can
[21:42] understand
[21:44] because they'll be part of him that's
[21:47] what i like about it i like to
[21:49] to think about what it's done you don't
[21:51] never sit down
[21:52] i do sometimes because like i said i've
[21:54] been 50 years
[21:55] preaching this message in a 40-something
[21:59] and i just sat down sometimes and just
[22:02] think
[22:04] what a wonderful opportunity i have had
[22:09] you don't think like that about that
[22:11] that you could pick up the bible
[22:13] and understand what you once
[22:18] was so mixed up in until you could not
[22:21] comprehend what was being said or
[22:24] anything but now you can just sit down
[22:28] and just think about him and how he's
[22:31] revealed himself
[22:34] to you and i this that's a wonderful
[22:37] wonderful opportunity to be able to come
[22:39] to that place all right
[22:41] but let's get into the thought now and
[22:43] try to
[22:44] understand so go ahead with number one
[22:46] and let's pick up a couple of scriptures
[22:48] that we used last sunday and let's pick
[22:50] those scriptures up
[22:52] and then we'll go into the quotes of the
[22:54] prophet but i wished as i'm getting the
[22:56] point to there
[22:57] i wish you would take all of these
[22:59] quotes i've made an opportunity
[23:01] last week we made some extra copies if
[23:04] you don't have a copy
[23:06] let me know especially of this today
[23:10] even if it takes another message because
[23:12] it'll be on the bride being the fullness
[23:14] of the godhead bodily
[23:16] well see then you'll see that it's not
[23:18] what i've tried to say
[23:20] or some idea that i have or a thought
[23:23] is what the prophet said
[23:26] all right then what he said is the
[23:29] finality
[23:30] and we have no rights and he couldn't uh
[23:32] i was thinking about what i tried to put
[23:34] in on the
[23:34] message there last sunday that you know
[23:37] he couldn't do it no other way
[23:41] forget that of well this could happen
[23:43] and we could have done this and we could
[23:44] forget all of that and remember one
[23:47] thing it couldn't happen no other way
[23:51] right because he knew it now he knew
[23:54] you'd be sitting here today right
[23:57] well you know what there's no way in the
[23:58] world you could get by without being
[24:00] here
[24:02] i don't care how many car wrecks you had
[24:04] and shotguns poked down your throats or
[24:06] what is going on
[24:07] you're going to be here because he said
[24:08] you would
[24:10] well we ought to start thinking like
[24:12] that on a positive
[24:13] note yes amen of the hour that's it
[24:16] here's
[24:17] you know for weeks and weeks i've been
[24:19] driving that hard
[24:20] to see get us to see something positive
[24:23] about what's taking place
[24:25] that we're a part of this is the bible
[24:28] being made
[24:28] manifest in this day among us
[24:32] by the things that are taking place
[24:34] around the world
[24:36] and all that and what about us having
[24:37] the understanding of that
[24:42] that don't thrill you that's that's
[24:43] something what is that thing you
[24:46] say aaron that your spoons fell out of
[24:48] your bowl or something
[24:50] i can't keep up with all of that but
[24:52] listen let's just read the scriptures
[24:54] and get
[24:54] into the thought now because we're going
[24:56] to be dealing
[24:58] we've got to review a little then we'll
[24:59] start dealing with
[25:01] the bride of jesus christ being
[25:04] the fullness of the godhead bodily okay
[25:06] now listen
[25:09] and he is before all things colossians
[25:12] 1 17-19 and by him all things consist
[25:17] and he's the head of the body the church
[25:20] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[25:23] the dead
[25:24] that in all things he might have the
[25:26] preeminence now what is preeminence
[25:29] first place is that a good definition of
[25:33] preeminence
[25:34] i mean you got other definition but it
[25:36] really this means first
[25:38] place god has always wanted
[25:41] preeminence in his church because he
[25:43] wants to be
[25:44] number one and he ain't gonna take
[25:47] number two
[25:48] or number three so don't think well i'll
[25:51] give him this much of it no
[25:53] it's gonna be the preeminence because
[25:54] that's what he said the prophet
[25:56] said the preeminence
[25:59] see if you want to know what's going to
[26:00] take us out of here in a change of the
[26:03] body and a rapture
[26:05] and of things it's preeminence
[26:08] it's yielding to him first place in our
[26:11] lives
[26:14] and letting him take over all right so
[26:16] now listen
[26:17] and he's the head of the body of the
[26:19] church who is the beginning the
[26:20] firstborn from the dead
[26:21] that in all things he might have the
[26:23] preeminence for it please the father
[26:26] that in him should all fullness
[26:29] dwell now all fullness is to dwell
[26:35] now i've spent time trying to explain
[26:38] that and i'll spend just a little minute
[26:40] on it
[26:42] we're going to be reading a lot of
[26:44] things the prophet said
[26:45] all god was he poured into christ all
[26:47] christ into the church to take her back
[26:49] to the garden of eden
[26:50] all right but i've also tried to explain
[26:53] that
[26:54] maybe wrong to try to explain god's word
[26:56] but
[26:57] the best i can do i i like i kind of
[27:00] like it that way i like for you to
[27:02] explain
[27:02] what you're talking about to me because
[27:05] that's you know that don't leave me
[27:07] that leaves me to understand and
[27:09] remember our points we've always tried
[27:11] to make about that little thought there
[27:15] that all god was he poured into christ
[27:16] all christ into the church take her back
[27:18] all right in your mind do you think of
[27:22] all god was
[27:23] he poured into christ and that just does
[27:24] away with god
[27:30] you see if you hold that thought it
[27:32] sounds real good
[27:34] it sounds like well hey yeah all god was
[27:38] he poured into christ no
[27:43] i just said it there a moment ago when
[27:46] we
[27:46] get on the other side into the
[27:50] eternities the prophet said
[27:52] god would be bringing us his message of
[27:55] cheer
[27:56] down to the endless ages
[28:00] so when you're saying oh god was poured
[28:03] into christ
[28:05] does that do away with god just he's
[28:07] gone
[28:09] well now there's christ he said well
[28:12] he's christ
[28:12] we got it right we got the god head
[28:14] right well what about when all
[28:16] christ was he pours into the church now
[28:18] he's christ's gone
[28:21] i mean you're gonna annihilate it's
[28:22] gonna do away with it
[28:24] or you're gonna wind up with nothing but
[28:26] yourself
[28:28] and see you don't realize now listen i
[28:30] hate to make this statement
[28:32] but it's true you don't realize that
[28:34] satan's plan
[28:36] satan's plan is to try to get me and you
[28:40] to believe that we are god
[28:43] because that would make him bring it
[28:44] into his being
[28:46] the wrong way satan's got that plan
[28:50] that's what he's wanting to do
[28:51] and see if we think that we are
[28:53] something then we're nothing
[28:56] that's the best way to say it and just
[28:58] get on that but you know that i've been
[29:00] explaining that down through time
[29:02] all the time trying to on the godhead to
[29:05] not do away with this
[29:07] move it over into another form
[29:11] it enhances or magnifies as it moves
[29:14] over from
[29:15] all god into christ
[29:19] then from all christ into the church it
[29:21] just keeps manifesting or manif
[29:24] um you know bringing more into the
[29:27] reality
[29:28] and then to bring it all into the church
[29:31] all right
[29:32] and see then when i read these things
[29:34] don't try to get anything well
[29:36] i don't know uh all god was important to
[29:38] christ all christ in the church
[29:40] talking about well i guess we ain't got
[29:41] nothing left because that's what you're
[29:43] saying
[29:47] if you don't hold that point correct
[29:48] that's what you're saying
[29:51] you're making yourself greater than he
[29:53] is
[29:55] and that's satan's plan because that's
[29:58] what he wants
[30:00] he wants to be number one
[30:06] but he can't do it all right go ahead to
[30:09] the next one number two now
[30:11] just for colossians all right colossians
[30:13] 2 10
[30:14] 9-10 for in him dwelleth all the
[30:17] fullness
[30:18] of the godhead bodily
[30:22] and look what it says and ye are
[30:24] complete in him
[30:28] so now if he's not complete without us
[30:30] we're part of him he's in us
[30:32] it's in us right which is the head of
[30:34] all principalities and power
[30:37] all right in him dwelt the fullness
[30:40] of the godhead bodily
[30:45] then there's not a god over here and a
[30:47] god over here and the three gods and the
[30:49] situation
[30:50] no it's coming into reality
[30:54] okay reality of what it's supposed to be
[30:59] brother branham in the philadelphian
[31:01] church they don't have to pull if they
[31:02] can if they want to
[31:04] some of these i'll just read them or
[31:06] cover it
[31:07] brother branham in the philippine church
[31:09] age said
[31:10] jesus spoke of his body as being the
[31:12] temple
[31:15] it was it was the temple of god
[31:18] but now that we are his body
[31:21] the true church is the temple of god
[31:24] by the holy ghost within us
[31:28] so he's not here now physically
[31:32] we meet him in the air
[31:36] all right so he's not here now that's
[31:38] the words of the problem we meet him in
[31:40] the air he doesn't come here
[31:42] physically but now here's the statements
[31:45] of the problem he is to come
[31:47] so visible among us until he would raise
[31:50] the dead
[31:51] and we'd go in the rapture now that's a
[31:53] direct quote
[31:55] he's going to be that way but not
[31:58] physically
[32:00] not in the 16th element
[32:03] but he's here in a greater way than the
[32:05] 16 elements
[32:06] because he's hearing you and me
[32:10] all right and see being that then
[32:14] what is that going to make me and you
[32:19] all right see then
[32:24] he made a temple he had the temple he
[32:26] had the things
[32:27] but then he came into the temple that he
[32:29] wanted to come into which was the body
[32:31] of jesus christ bringing him to the
[32:35] fullness of the godhead bodily
[32:37] bringing him to the situation to where
[32:40] that all power reading a minute was
[32:42] given unto him
[32:44] all right then
[32:48] if all of that comes into the bride
[32:52] who's the bride
[32:58] that's the simple point that i'm asking
[32:59] you
[33:01] go ahead let's read a few of these
[33:06] yeah because we had that about the
[33:08] temple
[33:09] let me get this part down god manifested
[33:11] himself there
[33:12] at sodom as a prophet being a man
[33:15] in flesh god elohim as i heard someone
[33:18] speak
[33:19] it a while ago which the godhead bodily
[33:22] was in him
[33:24] he was the fullness elohim
[33:28] is the fullness of the godhead bodily
[33:32] all right now elohim is the amorphy god
[33:36] right
[33:38] god who come down and he'll morph it
[33:40] himself
[33:42] with his people then he finally comes in
[33:44] his people
[33:46] all right and see then it brings the
[33:48] fullness of the godhead
[33:50] bodily into jesus christ
[33:53] but that's not all the story look at
[33:56] number five
[33:58] we'll pick these up
[34:03] and he didn't overcome she'll sit with
[34:05] me in my throne as i have
[34:06] overcome and set down on my father's
[34:08] throne
[34:09] in other words i took within
[34:13] my body the holy spirit i overcame all
[34:17] the things of the world
[34:19] through temptations and by the holy
[34:21] spirit
[34:24] and in him dwells the fullness of the
[34:26] godhead bodily
[34:28] all powers in heaven and in earth is
[34:30] given unto my hands
[34:32] he said all the power
[34:35] then god is powerless
[34:39] what's your prophet that way he can talk
[34:46] in other words what is he trying to
[34:48] explain that there's not a god over here
[34:50] and a god here and a god here called a
[34:53] trinity
[34:55] he's trying to express it to the fact of
[34:58] one true and living god or the correct
[35:02] idea of the oneness all right
[35:05] so look what he's saying he said all
[35:08] power
[35:09] then god is powerless if he's another
[35:11] person
[35:14] that's what i like he's powerless if
[35:17] he's another person
[35:20] so if there's three gods in your godhead
[35:23] trinity idea
[35:27] then who created who who started what
[35:29] and who's the most powerful
[35:35] jesus said all power in heaven and earth
[35:37] is given unto me
[35:40] so then he's he's powerless
[35:44] for the bible said jesus said after his
[35:46] resurrection
[35:47] that all power in heaven and earth both
[35:50] was given to his hands okay
[35:52] jump to number 5a
[35:55] all right questions and answers on
[35:57] hebrews
[36:00] and this makes the professors get great
[36:04] but it's simple now i'll read matthew 28
[36:08] 19
[36:09] and you follow me and some of you with
[36:11] acts 2 38
[36:13] have it ready i'll begin with it you
[36:15] know reading jesus came
[36:17] all right come on down to what he's
[36:18] doing speak unto his disciples senator
[36:21] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[36:24] in earth
[36:25] where's the father's power if all the
[36:28] power in heaven and earth is given to
[36:30] jesus
[36:32] god got powerless then didn't he
[36:36] or did he just tell a story
[36:40] was he joking he meant it
[36:44] because you believe it he meant it well
[36:46] all power is given unto me
[36:48] where's god's power at then he was
[36:51] god that's the exact that's the only
[36:54] thing there is to it see he is
[37:00] the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt
[37:03] in jesus christ
[37:06] all right why because he's almighty god
[37:12] he's not a second person or an idea
[37:16] if he did you'd have two or three and
[37:17] one of them would be powerless this
[37:19] would be powerless
[37:19] who created who who took care of what
[37:22] you know
[37:23] you understand he said well i just can't
[37:26] understand the godhead i can't
[37:28] because you know there's one over here
[37:30] and one over here no
[37:33] think of how that god can condescend
[37:37] into another form
[37:40] he could condescend from father jehovah
[37:42] the old testament
[37:45] into the body of jesus christ
[37:49] and that doesn't do away with him
[37:54] he moves over into that form
[37:59] all right well can you understand it
[38:02] like that then
[38:03] jesus was god manifested
[38:06] in another form
[38:10] is that simple god was manifested in
[38:14] another form
[38:14] in other words one day
[38:18] i got married that made me a husband
[38:23] then here comes white on the scene that
[38:25] made me a father
[38:27] but did it change me did it make me any
[38:31] different
[38:32] no i'm the same person
[38:38] so it's it's not just it's god just
[38:40] moving over in another form and
[38:46] manifesting himself for the way that he
[38:47] needs to do
[38:49] all right
[38:52] let's see did we read this one go ahead
[38:55] go ahead number six let's just get
[38:57] started on the thought
[38:59] if you don't believe it by reading what
[39:01] the prophet said then it don't do
[39:02] anything
[39:03] good for me to read it to you and holler
[39:04] and scream at you i just
[39:06] go on down the road and try to help you
[39:08] to understand
[39:10] i've always tried to preach one true and
[39:12] living god
[39:14] to see him as the prophet taught it that
[39:16] way i don't have to
[39:18] you come to me in other words let me say
[39:19] it this way you come to me and show me
[39:22] where i missed
[39:23] the teaching of the godhead
[39:27] i'm inviting you come and show me where
[39:30] i've missed
[39:31] the teaching of the prophet
[39:35] i'm inviting you to
[39:39] come let's sit down and talk about it
[39:44] it may be just misunderstandings
[39:48] because that can take place it may be
[39:51] just some
[39:51] thought that we have but come and let's
[39:56] talk about it
[39:59] all right lord show me where i've missed
[40:03] the message that's all i've asked
[40:06] well you don't believe in this you don't
[40:08] now wait a minute let's don't get down
[40:09] into
[40:10] whether he's coming on a white horse or
[40:12] a red horse or a green horse or what
[40:14] kind of horse
[40:17] we don't have to get into the silliness
[40:19] of it we get into the basis of knowing
[40:22] he's coming
[40:26] but are you following me now oh god
[40:29] we'll go through these and read it and
[40:30] now
[40:31] all god was he's
[40:34] in morphe's changes his form steps over
[40:38] into another form
[40:39] and manifesting himself as the son of
[40:42] god
[40:44] then one day that same god
[40:50] comes forth and manifests himself by
[40:52] morphing
[40:53] into a church on the day of pentecost
[40:57] now what is let's see
[41:01] what is the new birth
[41:06] the prophet said it's father son and
[41:07] holy ghost coming and living in you
[41:13] the truth father son and holy ghost
[41:16] coming and living in you
[41:18] so are you right now by the new birth
[41:20] how the father son and the holy ghost
[41:22] dwelling inside of you
[41:26] in the form we would call it the holy
[41:28] spirit that's fine
[41:30] but just remember it is
[41:34] the fullness of god but
[41:37] on the product if we don't get it in a
[41:39] fullness we just get it in a part
[41:41] but he's the fullness but in the entire
[41:44] bride he's the fullness
[41:47] we'll read those things in a minute but
[41:49] i'm just
[41:50] trying to ask you a question it takes
[41:53] father son and holy ghost to make one
[41:55] god
[41:57] all right then don't do away with the
[41:59] father and move over and have a son
[42:01] manifest
[42:02] and then do away with that and have a
[42:03] bride no
[42:06] go into that form and just think about
[42:08] it on the day of pentecost
[42:10] god came back your prophet says
[42:14] in the form of the baptism of the holy
[42:17] ghost
[42:20] which was jehovah god coming and living
[42:22] in you
[42:24] see if you have the new birth right now
[42:27] you have father son and holy ghost
[42:29] dwelling in you
[42:35] that's very close to being the fullness
[42:37] of the godhead in one person but
[42:39] it won't be now we can't do it with that
[42:41] now we've got to keep that right
[42:46] it won't be in one person why because he
[42:48] gives it to us
[42:49] as a spoonful but remember the spoonful
[42:52] out of the ocean is the same water of
[42:56] the full ocean
[42:59] in other words it's god
[43:03] you have the new birth you have the
[43:04] father son and holy ghost
[43:06] dwelling in you no brother dale always
[43:09] thought it was just the
[43:10] holy ghost that we have see
[43:14] the holy ghost is the father it's just
[43:17] another form
[43:20] so listen to what i'm trying to say then
[43:22] and watch it through the series in the
[43:23] message
[43:25] all god was he just amorphies
[43:30] changes his form
[43:34] to make known himself as
[43:38] the son of god
[43:42] all right see then he just makes himself
[43:45] known as the bride
[43:47] it doesn't do away with god
[43:51] come on
[43:55] where's the body of jesus now
[43:58] i emphasize that a lot right
[44:02] that god
[44:05] come and came down and lived in a body
[44:10] but you know what he took that body up
[44:12] and left it
[44:14] and what do i emphasize you can't have
[44:18] two bodies
[44:19] god doesn't have two bodies on this
[44:21] earth at the same time
[44:24] so if he's got a body and he's dwelling
[44:26] in his bride there's
[44:27] enough it doesn't make two gods out of
[44:31] it doesn't make a father out of it and
[44:33] and a bride out of it you become god
[44:36] made manifest
[44:38] why can't we get it that way why can't
[44:42] we see it
[44:42] in a way but brother dale you mean to
[44:46] say that we're god made manifest will
[44:48] you tell me what you are
[44:50] you're a child of god a child of god is
[44:52] god made manifest in another form
[45:02] right
[45:04] so let's just read a few things now
[45:05] we've we've tried to keep it a little
[45:07] bit
[45:08] on the line of of uh
[45:11] i deliberately moved quotes around to
[45:13] where
[45:14] that my emphasis up till now has been
[45:16] dwelling with what
[45:18] that in god dwelt the fullness of the
[45:20] godhead bodily
[45:23] that should be sensible no problems no
[45:27] thoughts no ideas that are contrary
[45:29] he was the fullness of the godhead
[45:30] bodily
[45:34] all right now let's go into the bride
[45:36] let's go into the next okay
[45:38] let's see what have we got
[45:42] good shepherd of the chief oh that's
[45:44] where we okay yeah
[45:47] what pentecost needs is a good bible
[45:49] lesson
[45:50] good teaching then you wouldn't need to
[45:53] much
[45:53] going on wouldn't need so much going on
[45:57] jesus christ was the son of god he had
[45:59] the spirit without measure
[46:01] we believed that in him never dwelt
[46:05] just a part of god but all of god
[46:09] was in his son jesus christ
[46:12] he was the fullness of the godhead
[46:14] bodily
[46:16] all of god was poured out in christ
[46:21] all that god was was in christ on all
[46:25] that christ
[46:25] is he poured out on the church
[46:29] but you keep refusing it
[46:33] look what your prophet put right in
[46:37] but you keep refusing it in other words
[46:40] you refuse to understand it
[46:48] you're still hung up in mind like i said
[46:52] i've heard
[46:52] ministers you have to they're trying to
[46:55] explain the godhead and the thing
[46:56] they say all god was all god was
[47:00] now all means all
[47:04] well you just done away with god
[47:11] why not think about it like this all
[47:14] that god was going to make manifest
[47:17] on earth
[47:22] was in jesus christ
[47:27] all that god was going to make manifest
[47:32] then would put jesus christ into the
[47:35] bride
[47:37] it's not all the basis of getting rid of
[47:40] everything
[47:41] it's all of what he's going to do
[47:43] because come on now you shook your head
[47:45] if nothing else you didn't amen
[47:47] that's not right with me but when you
[47:48] shake that head brother donny reagan
[47:50] says that that means
[47:51] yeah right right so you shook your head
[47:54] while ago
[47:55] about some things so just remember where
[47:58] you're shaking your head out
[48:00] all right see all
[48:06] god was
[48:10] he just stepped over into another form
[48:16] called jesus
[48:20] then all jesus was through the
[48:22] manifestations of the amorphies and
[48:24] the things that he's doing steps over
[48:26] into a church
[48:32] all right so if now if
[48:36] if it's true
[48:40] that in him dwell the fullness of the
[48:41] godhead bodily
[48:43] if it's true that jesus could say
[48:49] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[48:51] in earth
[48:57] and your prophet said then where's the
[48:58] power of the father
[49:04] he's trying to explain it right
[49:09] god changing him his form
[49:13] from one form to another
[49:16] all right you see that way you can
[49:18] understand the godhead
[49:19] because look what he said and him never
[49:22] dwelt just a part
[49:24] of god but all of god was in his son
[49:28] christ jesus
[49:33] he was the fullness of the godhead
[49:35] bodily
[49:37] all of god was poured out in christ
[49:40] all that god was was in christ
[49:44] and all that christ is he poured out on
[49:46] the church
[49:48] but you keep refusing you refuse to
[49:51] understand
[49:52] see the things that if i do not the
[49:54] works of my father
[49:56] believe me not
[49:59] how did his father send him the father
[50:03] sent him what
[50:05] went with him and in him
[50:10] so he just stepped from one form to
[50:12] another
[50:14] he didn't do the way with that
[50:18] when we get to glory i i do not and i've
[50:20] always taught it and believe it as well
[50:22] i don't believe we're going to have a
[50:23] part here a little part to
[50:25] represent the father and little part to
[50:27] represent the son and learn
[50:28] to represent the holy ghost i don't
[50:30] believe that now i've always taught it i
[50:32] don't believe that
[50:35] so don't ever accuse me of that even
[50:36] though you think that's the way i'm
[50:37] going with it
[50:39] just remember one thing jesus said
[50:45] i and my father are one
[50:49] and it's i in you and you and me
[50:54] all right we're going to have we're
[50:57] going back to that body we can
[50:59] understand more
[51:00] we're going to have according to the
[51:02] bible a body like unto his glorious body
[51:12] but see all of the fullness
[51:17] but just keep that in mind now i keep
[51:19] inside i know how the human mind runs at
[51:21] least
[51:22] mine does so you forgive me to try to
[51:24] explain your
[51:25] me to you i guess
[51:28] but just remember
[51:32] all god was important to christ doesn't
[51:34] do away with god
[51:37] it manifests god
[51:40] it magnifies god
[51:43] on the day of pentecost you had here
[51:46] before his crucifixion one man
[51:48] that had the fullness of the godhead
[51:50] bodily
[51:54] but then on the day of pentecost that
[51:57] god came into first 120
[52:00] and then 3 000 and it's been thousands
[52:03] and thousands and millions coming since
[52:04] then
[52:06] of that god that's right
[52:11] but you see we say tonight well i'd like
[52:13] to have been there in the upper room
[52:15] what about your upper room experience
[52:20] what about your salvation you don't
[52:22] believe that that lick of fire came down
[52:24] on you
[52:26] well i've heard people explain this and
[52:27] explain it it didn't happen to me
[52:29] well what do you want some form out of
[52:33] it that
[52:33] will run into like they did with it and
[52:35] made tongs as the evidence or something
[52:38] or pillars of fires is the evidences or
[52:40] is this that or the other
[52:45] i'm talking about the coming forth into
[52:48] you and i
[52:49] as a person
[52:53] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:58] the new birth is the person of jesus
[53:01] christ
[53:02] coming and living in you
[53:05] right if not what is it
[53:08] well if i got a person in here think
[53:15] you let your mind just run into channels
[53:18] just listen sometime sit down and read
[53:21] the prophet's message
[53:25] i get through this series one of these
[53:26] things i i'm gonna try to bring out
[53:27] something
[53:28] that i've been thinking on
[53:31] and how everything can be natural
[53:35] and come down but then it turned out to
[53:37] be supernatural
[53:40] and we'll get to it but i'm trying my
[53:43] best to express this to us
[53:48] so go ahead to number seven
[53:51] christ is a mystery of god reveal
[53:54] i want to coax just a little bit so that
[53:57] even people listening to the tape will
[53:59] get the idea all right coming on down
[54:03] what i'm this is what i'm coming to god
[54:05] expressed in jesus christ
[54:09] who was both father son and holy ghost
[54:14] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[54:16] that's what he was
[54:18] he was father son and holy ghost the
[54:21] fullness of the godhead bodily
[54:26] but now listen you shook your head
[54:29] uh-huh
[54:30] do you believe when we get over on that
[54:31] other side that he's going to bring us a
[54:34] message of cheer
[54:36] or do you think you don't got all of it
[54:38] here
[54:40] uh-uh i don't i think we just getting
[54:42] enough here to be able to understand
[54:44] when we get over there
[54:46] all right that's the way i believe it i
[54:49] believe we're just getting enough
[54:52] to be able to understand and watch
[54:57] the fullness of the godhead bodily now
[54:59] the complete fullness of the godhead
[55:01] bodily
[55:02] dwells in his church
[55:05] the preeminence the first place
[55:09] in his church well brother dale i just
[55:12] i just don't see that in the people of
[55:14] this message well where are you going
[55:19] that's all i want to know if you know
[55:21] it's somewhere else tell me let's go
[55:28] i'm not joking if you know of another
[55:30] church where they're bringing it out the
[55:32] truth
[55:33] and god is coming and manifesting and
[55:34] showing it then let's go
[55:42] [Music]
[55:43] we better be concerned about it
[55:48] well i think brother son well let's
[55:49] check out what his doctrine is
[55:52] check out their ways and their actions
[55:53] and let's see
[55:58] see the complete fullness of the godhead
[56:00] bodily dwells in his church
[56:03] the preeminence now watch fullness
[56:06] listen
[56:07] keep the word fullness in your mind now
[56:09] and listen
[56:10] all that god was the fullness
[56:16] now that god had bodily all that god was
[56:20] he poured into christ
[56:25] so what went into christ the fullness of
[56:27] the godhead
[56:29] okay all that god was he poured into
[56:32] christ
[56:33] all that christ was was poured into the
[56:36] church
[56:37] the believers not your denomination
[56:40] the believers the true born again
[56:42] believers
[56:45] so all god was coming forth and
[56:48] manifesting himself
[56:49] in a manifestation for us to understand
[56:52] was eventually poured into jesus christ
[56:56] and then it was poured into his church
[56:59] and when it's finished
[57:01] i can't help it i can't help it
[57:04] that we can't look and see god in people
[57:11] see we're looking to sue to soon we're
[57:13] looking to
[57:14] try to find some form of of a position
[57:17] to put it or whatever
[57:20] just remember whatever you're looking
[57:22] for then why
[57:23] are you not the first one manifesting
[57:26] that that you're looking for
[57:33] if we need to do this let's do it
[57:38] if that's what we need let's do it
[57:43] yeah but brother dale i'm just and i
[57:45] know
[57:49] but he poured it into the church all
[57:52] right go ahead
[57:53] the believers go ahead to the next one
[57:57] number eight but when the great ransom
[58:01] body through
[58:02] all ages comes up
[58:05] then that's going to be a great throne
[58:09] there revelation 7 expresses it
[58:12] great number which no man could number
[58:15] so all of the ages has come up them
[58:18] that's walked in the light of the bible
[58:21] as far as it was revealed to them
[58:24] and now we know that wesley had more
[58:27] light
[58:28] than luther did we know that pentecost
[58:30] outshined wesley certainly it does
[58:34] because it's just gradually let loose
[58:38] as it did down through the prophets and
[58:41] so forth
[58:42] until it was perfectly made known
[58:45] the godhead bodily in christ
[58:51] was finally made known it took the
[58:54] prophet
[58:55] to bring it
[58:59] right no problem but look
[59:03] and now the christ
[59:06] in the churches just being made known
[59:11] the whole thing is the revelation of god
[59:15] to take eve back to her right position
[59:18] again with her husband notice and god
[59:22] is the husband of the church and the
[59:24] church is his bride
[59:27] back on it
[59:32] all right jump to number nine now we're
[59:34] going because we used that
[59:36] one a while ago
[59:41] now to you that's got your bibles turn
[59:44] to chapter one of revelation
[59:46] and start from the ninth verse
[59:49] your pencils and papers and i'll try to
[59:51] give you a little
[59:52] dates and so forth as we go along
[59:56] now this is actually this morning was
[59:58] more of the sermon type placing the
[1:00:00] foundation
[1:00:01] upon the deity of the revelation
[1:00:04] god being revealed in christ
[1:00:07] how many believes it god was revealed in
[1:00:10] christ
[1:00:12] jehovah revealed in christ
[1:00:16] now where's god to be revealed
[1:00:19] amen
[1:00:25] he only got from christ to the church
[1:00:27] you you don't have no second
[1:00:29] 13 14 15 persons in between
[1:00:33] right listen
[1:00:37] how many believes it god was revealed in
[1:00:40] christ
[1:00:41] jehovah revealed in christ now where's
[1:00:44] where's god to be revealed
[1:00:46] in his church with his people in us
[1:00:49] the same spirit the same works the same
[1:00:52] manifestation
[1:00:53] the same love the same forgiveness the
[1:00:56] same long-suffering
[1:00:58] gentleness patience peace mercy all that
[1:01:01] was in crisis in the church
[1:01:03] remember keep this in your mind all that
[1:01:06] god
[1:01:06] was he poured into christ
[1:01:10] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:01:12] bodily so what was poured into christ
[1:01:14] the fullness of the godhead bodily now
[1:01:16] what
[1:01:18] and all that christ was he poured into
[1:01:21] the church
[1:01:22] what's in the church the fullness of the
[1:01:24] godhead bodily
[1:01:26] are you reading
[1:01:29] god above us god with us god in us that
[1:01:32] triunity
[1:01:33] not trinity triunity of god god
[1:01:36] manifested in three different
[1:01:38] manners father son and holy spirit
[1:01:41] what is it but do we believe it or are
[1:01:45] we still turning it down
[1:01:47] are we still refusing it as we read
[1:01:49] there while ago
[1:01:53] i mean there's one thing for sure you're
[1:01:55] gonna have to admit one thing
[1:01:57] i do make you think
[1:02:00] some people told me one time so you make
[1:02:02] us think well that's what i want us to
[1:02:04] do
[1:02:06] i want us to think because we're blinded
[1:02:09] for the point until we
[1:02:11] we do start getting it in the right
[1:02:12] order and the only way you'll get it in
[1:02:14] the right order is think about
[1:02:19] all it go ahead number 10
[1:02:25] because then this is taken before we
[1:02:26] would see jesus we would see jesus
[1:02:30] then he god was in one man
[1:02:33] christ jesus and him brought the
[1:02:37] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:02:38] in that one man and when that pillar of
[1:02:41] fire come down at pentecost you notice
[1:02:45] tongues of fire set upon each
[1:02:48] of them because they begin to speak in
[1:02:51] tongues
[1:02:52] before they begin to speak in tongues
[1:02:54] there was
[1:02:55] tongues of fire that was god separating
[1:02:58] himself
[1:03:00] from the pillar of fire into each member
[1:03:03] of his church
[1:03:05] god separated himself so he could be
[1:03:08] universally all over everywhere
[1:03:12] at one time universally
[1:03:16] universal means all the way around all
[1:03:18] over all
[1:03:22] you mean tell me brother dale do you
[1:03:24] believe that there's going to be a day
[1:03:25] happen
[1:03:26] that he'll be universally around the
[1:03:28] world in the broader crowd i do
[1:03:30] i've always believed it i've always
[1:03:32] believed that quote because that hangs
[1:03:34] in my mind
[1:03:35] where he said that god will pour into us
[1:03:38] his fullness
[1:03:42] see church this is 1969
[1:03:48] because that's where i started preaching
[1:03:49] this
[1:03:52] in athens georgia oh you already seen it
[1:03:56] then
[1:03:58] because when i begin to say that the
[1:04:00] bride is the son of man
[1:04:02] well i could just i didn't have to read
[1:04:04] i could read live
[1:04:05] no the prophet's the son of man i said
[1:04:08] it's not the prophet
[1:04:10] the prophet is not the son of man i had
[1:04:12] to spend the whole service
[1:04:14] explaining that brother branham was not
[1:04:16] god
[1:04:22] i admit and say it and plan and don't
[1:04:25] worry about it he was closest thing to
[1:04:27] it
[1:04:28] than we've ever seen some of you saw him
[1:04:31] in real life
[1:04:32] you saw god living in a man but still
[1:04:35] you he told you don't get it confused
[1:04:43] come on he says right now
[1:04:48] healing meetings is going is going in
[1:04:52] africa the limes are walking the blinds
[1:04:55] are seeing
[1:04:56] all around the world the universal
[1:04:59] church
[1:05:00] of the lord jesus christ and individuals
[1:05:04] men who's living and serving him god
[1:05:07] separated himself and placed himself
[1:05:10] out among that day you'll know that i am
[1:05:13] in the father the father in me
[1:05:14] i knew you and me see i will be a little
[1:05:17] while in the world
[1:05:19] because most no cosmos there
[1:05:22] the world order will see me no more yet
[1:05:25] the church
[1:05:26] shall see me for i as a personal pronoun
[1:05:29] i'll be with you
[1:05:30] even in you to the end of the world
[1:05:33] that's right
[1:05:34] i i will be with you seeing
[1:05:37] see the universal church of the lord
[1:05:40] jesus christ
[1:05:41] i'll be with you the works that i do
[1:05:44] so you do also
[1:05:49] listen church i don't
[1:05:53] say things to hurt people's feelings i
[1:05:55] know i do
[1:05:56] i'm sorry but i don't say it to hurt
[1:05:59] your feelings
[1:06:01] i say it to try to get you and me to the
[1:06:03] one place
[1:06:05] if we believe what the prophet says
[1:06:10] oh yeah i believe every word he says but
[1:06:13] i just write this problem over here i
[1:06:14] got his problem
[1:06:15] yeah that's what i mean
[1:06:20] but see do we believe what the prophet
[1:06:23] has said
[1:06:26] well i believe everything he said
[1:06:31] do you understand what he's saying well
[1:06:33] i don't really know for sure where i
[1:06:34] fully understand it or not
[1:06:36] well that's that's human we're human i'm
[1:06:38] not throwing off on nobody
[1:06:42] but i thought that we believe that they
[1:06:46] would be eventually
[1:06:48] to a place that we would be changed and
[1:06:50] taken out of this mess that we're in
[1:06:54] well who's going to do it
[1:07:01] well i don't know well who's going to do
[1:07:02] it
[1:07:04] go ahead number 11. we'll just keep
[1:07:07] reading a little bit do we
[1:07:10] now this is as we would see so there was
[1:07:12] sirs we would see
[1:07:15] look at moses how he was hid in the bull
[1:07:17] rush like christ
[1:07:18] so forth took it to egypt and oh just
[1:07:21] everything a lawgiver and whatever more
[1:07:24] he just betrayed christ
[1:07:28] then when christ come in him was the
[1:07:31] fullness
[1:07:32] of the spirit see that was the fullness
[1:07:35] of the godhead bodily was in christ
[1:07:39] they had it by measure now we know that
[1:07:41] same thing here tonight by the holy
[1:07:43] ghost
[1:07:44] on the day of pentecost that pillar of
[1:07:46] fire broke into many tongues of fire
[1:07:49] four tongues and said god was separating
[1:07:51] himself
[1:07:52] among the people that day god was in
[1:07:56] one person christ now he's in the entire
[1:07:59] church
[1:08:00] universal amen
[1:08:04] he's in the entire church
[1:08:09] all right go ahead
[1:08:13] 12. lean out to your own understanding
[1:08:17] you've heard this one over and over so
[1:08:19] what did it say
[1:08:21] so if you were in the foreknowledge of
[1:08:22] god then
[1:08:24] are becoming a part of god and the only
[1:08:26] way you can be a son of god or a
[1:08:28] daughter of god
[1:08:29] you had to be a part of god and god
[1:08:31] isn't complete without you
[1:08:35] has to be that's right because there is
[1:08:37] on one
[1:08:38] only one resource of eternal life
[1:08:41] and that is god and him alone has
[1:08:44] eternal life
[1:08:45] now and you were part of him and so much
[1:08:48] that you're an attribute
[1:08:49] or in his thinking okay now we'll get
[1:08:52] back to those things these brothers are
[1:08:53] covering
[1:08:54] wonderful things on these and we just
[1:08:56] thank god for all of it
[1:08:57] but see we're going to get there but
[1:09:00] think about it
[1:09:04] go ahead number 13.
[1:09:08] cross is the mystery of god reveal and
[1:09:10] in there there would be a time come
[1:09:12] forth when he could express himself
[1:09:16] in fullness in his godhead
[1:09:22] deity through his church
[1:09:28] if you drop that off what are you in the
[1:09:30] fullness of his godhead amen jesus was
[1:09:32] the fullness of the godhead but what
[1:09:34] does he say
[1:09:34] deity through his
[1:09:38] church
[1:09:41] oh do you think you're god no i know i
[1:09:44] am
[1:09:44] what are you and if you don't think i am
[1:09:46] god you're off the word
[1:09:50] oh wait a minute now because i think
[1:09:51] you're god
[1:09:53] i think you're god in human flesh
[1:09:56] if you got the new birth
[1:10:00] if you got the new birth you're god in
[1:10:02] human flesh
[1:10:04] i believe that
[1:10:07] don't have no worries about it how the
[1:10:10] freedom and that's in his church oh my
[1:10:12] the anointed man now the anointed people
[1:10:16] oh my to bring back the anointed bride
[1:10:19] and the bridegroom anointed by why
[1:10:24] accepting what eve turned down and adam
[1:10:27] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:10:29] word because he said
[1:10:31] my word is spirit see anointed with the
[1:10:34] word
[1:10:35] what eve turned down he comes back and
[1:10:38] we see it what did brother brown say
[1:10:39] he's problem was one little bitty
[1:10:43] scripture
[1:10:46] right what was it somebody tell me
[1:10:53] hebrews 13 8.
[1:10:58] she was messed up in whether he was god
[1:11:01] or not
[1:11:03] she was messed up and whether or not
[1:11:05] there was a god-head dwelling in him
[1:11:07] and she was really messed up and
[1:11:08] wondered what was in her i guess
[1:11:12] come on i like the way wade was bringing
[1:11:14] out the other night i stayed with that
[1:11:16] always how
[1:11:17] adam and eve had eternal life in their
[1:11:19] soul you don't hear that priest in the
[1:11:20] people of this message
[1:11:22] they ain't going to do it i mean if i'm
[1:11:24] if i'm off the word you go get me one
[1:11:26] brain let me hear it
[1:11:29] go get me a tape of somebody in the
[1:11:32] message that explains that
[1:11:33] that adam and eve had eternal life in
[1:11:35] their soul
[1:11:37] well who do you think you are i hear one
[1:11:39] thing about it i don't care what you
[1:11:41] think i am
[1:11:43] god has brought forth his word
[1:11:46] what are we going to do i ain't
[1:11:48] challenging nobody or prone to nobody
[1:11:50] nothing
[1:11:51] i'm just telling it like it is
[1:11:56] you think you're some kind of smart ad i
[1:11:59] ain't smart
[1:12:00] i may be an elite i certainly ain't
[1:12:03] smart if i smart i'd quit and go home
[1:12:06] and let you have this thing
[1:12:09] if i smart i do that because i do away
[1:12:13] with all the heart acts and headaches
[1:12:14] that comes with doing it but don't you
[1:12:17] worry about it
[1:12:19] we're here and we're gonna make it out
[1:12:20] here
[1:12:22] see how that hybrid condition
[1:12:26] he told eve don't you do this and don't
[1:12:29] you do that
[1:12:33] eve was confused on one thing brother
[1:12:35] ryan said
[1:12:36] hebrews 13 8. he says that a quote when
[1:12:40] do you want it
[1:12:41] i'll be glad to get it after the service
[1:12:44] some of these can run it up now they can
[1:12:46] run it up and throw it over
[1:12:47] because you know it's true i wouldn't
[1:12:49] say that if the prophet hadn't said it
[1:12:52] because i'd be stupid i'd be trying to
[1:12:55] be something myself and i'm not
[1:12:57] i know that okay
[1:13:00] what do we get to we don't number what
[1:13:04] 13. did we get that 14 all right
[1:13:09] god's provided place of worship there is
[1:13:11] so many infallible proofs that jesus
[1:13:14] is the place he is the gate he's the
[1:13:17] name
[1:13:18] and the only provided way that god has
[1:13:20] for man to meet in worship
[1:13:22] he is the way he's the truth he's the
[1:13:24] life the gate the door the alpha the
[1:13:27] mega the beginning and the ending
[1:13:30] rosa shearer and lily of the valley
[1:13:32] bright and morning star all of that
[1:13:34] he is both rooting offspring of david
[1:13:36] the bright and the morning star and who
[1:13:38] is he
[1:13:40] in him dwells the fullness of the
[1:13:41] godhead bodily
[1:13:46] now look at little strange wordings
[1:13:50] where we in there are sons and daughters
[1:13:55] to god god in god's godhead
[1:13:58] so we're in the godhead and if that
[1:14:01] quote right back before then is right
[1:14:03] then the prophet said
[1:14:05] he's not complete without us the godhead
[1:14:07] is not complete without you brother ray
[1:14:12] yeah well i just put brother right too
[1:14:16] high
[1:14:17] huh it's the prophet telling you the
[1:14:20] truth
[1:14:22] we need to believe it okay let's go
[1:14:24] ahead what we got
[1:14:27] 15 so as we would see jesus
[1:14:30] and there was one to the called out
[1:14:32] elected church that was showing the sign
[1:14:34] that
[1:14:34] the god was in flesh jesus was god in
[1:14:36] flesh and if jesus
[1:14:38] is in you tonight it's still god
[1:14:41] manifest himself in the last days
[1:14:44] the son of man revealing himself
[1:14:48] in his church
[1:14:53] come on the human flesh making himself
[1:14:56] known
[1:14:56] hey come on in his church
[1:15:04] now see then brother branham was not the
[1:15:06] son of man
[1:15:08] but here's what's hard for you to follow
[1:15:11] the entire body of jesus christ
[1:15:15] all born again believers to make it the
[1:15:17] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:15:18] is the son of man
[1:15:22] and brother branham is a part of it
[1:15:26] that's right i'm sure when we get there
[1:15:27] it'd be a glorious time to hear him some
[1:15:29] more but
[1:15:31] just remember it's going to take
[1:15:33] everybody
[1:15:34] it's going to take every born-again
[1:15:36] believer
[1:15:38] to be i have never taught that no one
[1:15:42] group of people or one little people our
[1:15:44] brother dale would do it or anything
[1:15:46] like that
[1:15:46] i've never taught the son of man any
[1:15:49] other form except one thing
[1:15:52] it takes every member of the body of
[1:15:54] jesus christ
[1:15:56] to be the son of man
[1:16:00] it takes every member of the body of
[1:16:02] christ if you ain't listened as we've
[1:16:03] read
[1:16:04] to be the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:16:10] when are we going to believe it
[1:16:15] yeah but i just i just can't see it
[1:16:16] because i see you i see too many
[1:16:18] problems
[1:16:19] that's what you're doing you're looking
[1:16:20] at too many problems
[1:16:22] but just remember hey come on hey we got
[1:16:25] the old saying right
[1:16:26] i got two eyes looking at you you got
[1:16:28] two eyes looking at me
[1:16:32] right
[1:16:35] in other words i think i'm something
[1:16:37] you're looking down at me there's
[1:16:38] somebody looking down on you
[1:16:42] okay
[1:16:46] manifested himself in the last days the
[1:16:48] son of man revealing himself
[1:16:50] in his church the human flesh making
[1:16:52] himself
[1:16:53] known now listen brother branham was not
[1:16:57] the son of man he was not the fullness
[1:17:01] of the godhead bodily
[1:17:04] the entire bride of jesus christ is the
[1:17:08] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:17:10] i've taught that for almost 50 years now
[1:17:12] and i'm still teaching it
[1:17:14] the son of man which is the word made
[1:17:18] flesh right
[1:17:21] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:17:22] among us
[1:17:25] the son of man who is the son of man the
[1:17:27] lord jesus christ
[1:17:32] but look where we would be if a prophet
[1:17:35] hadn't come
[1:17:37] okay let's see if we can what do we got
[1:17:40] uh where are we on 16 okay
[1:17:45] run it on up let's pick up just watch
[1:17:48] because i want this point then we'll try
[1:17:50] to run five it has been hit since the
[1:17:52] foundation of the world
[1:17:54] and it's seven full mystery and god
[1:17:56] promised in this day at the age of this
[1:17:59] ladies in church
[1:18:00] he would take the mask off the whole
[1:18:02] thing and we could see
[1:18:04] it what a glorious thing god immorphy
[1:18:08] mask in the pillar of fire god in morphy
[1:18:11] in a man called jesus god and morphy in
[1:18:15] his church
[1:18:17] god above us god with us god in us the
[1:18:20] condescending
[1:18:21] of god okay jump to the next
[1:18:26] see if we can get these out 17. almighty
[1:18:29] god unveil
[1:18:29] then it was god in them days it was god
[1:18:32] and a man
[1:18:33] his son jesus christ we believe that not
[1:18:35] just a prophet not just an ordinary man
[1:18:38] or no human it was god in christ god in
[1:18:41] a man
[1:18:42] the fullness of the godhead bodily in a
[1:18:44] man
[1:18:45] god in a man now it's god
[1:18:48] in men the fullness of god in the
[1:18:50] godhead bodily
[1:18:52] in his entire church manifesting himself
[1:18:55] fulfilling his word he says that's what
[1:18:58] we are
[1:19:02] he says that's the point okay go ahead
[1:19:06] 18.
[1:19:08] let's see what we need on this around to
[1:19:10] run it to
[1:19:11] the bottom just where we can get this
[1:19:13] because i'm trying to get it in here and
[1:19:14] he's governed the body of the
[1:19:16] all the way through then the complete
[1:19:18] body of christ is revealed in the form
[1:19:21] of a bride
[1:19:22] that was taken out of his side like adam
[1:19:26] did at the beginning like adams
[1:19:29] was rather at the beginning
[1:19:32] 19 go on
[1:19:38] he's talking about he promised just
[1:19:39] before the coming of the end time
[1:19:42] the world would get like it was in sodom
[1:19:44] when a man come down
[1:19:46] in human form three of them two angels
[1:19:49] and god himself
[1:19:51] that was god the bible said it was
[1:19:55] now he come down and he manifests
[1:19:57] himself there
[1:19:58] by turning his back to the the tent the
[1:20:01] prophet done those things right
[1:20:03] so he's got the part to do he's part of
[1:20:05] the son of man as much as anybody else
[1:20:07] all right that's where i hold the whole
[1:20:09] point the tent where
[1:20:11] sarah was and told abraham what
[1:20:14] sarah was thinking in the tent
[1:20:17] congregation says yes amen
[1:20:19] okay watch jesus himself said all
[1:20:22] at the day when the son of man is being
[1:20:25] revealed
[1:20:26] in other words the son of man
[1:20:30] the ministry of jesus christ himself
[1:20:35] i believe brother branham had
[1:20:39] the ministry of jesus christ
[1:20:42] because that's malachi 4 luke 17 30 or
[1:20:45] revelation 10
[1:20:46] that's what the scripture says but it
[1:20:49] didn't make him
[1:20:51] no different he's a human being
[1:20:54] okay listen to this
[1:20:58] the church will come through
[1:20:59] justification
[1:21:02] through luther through sanctification
[1:21:04] through wesley
[1:21:05] through the baptism of the holy ghost or
[1:21:07] the pentecostals
[1:21:09] and go right on into the perfection
[1:21:12] of the son of man he said the church
[1:21:13] would do it
[1:21:15] so now you're denying him if you don't
[1:21:16] believe it it's not me
[1:21:19] you're denying him okay let's get one
[1:21:23] yeah let's get this one luther's
[1:21:27] justification wesley sanctification
[1:21:29] pentecostal baptism
[1:21:31] now we come to the head the capstone
[1:21:33] grace grace
[1:21:34] the capstone cried the headstone crying
[1:21:36] what grace grace
[1:21:38] passed from death and creed into a
[1:21:40] living word at the
[1:21:41] of the living god god's only provided
[1:21:43] place for his
[1:21:45] his age his sons in the word age
[1:21:48] quickened by the spirit like a spark
[1:21:52] that split off of
[1:21:53] something to make it alive and seated
[1:21:56] now in heavenly places in present tense
[1:21:58] already alive and subject to ever
[1:22:00] promise in the word
[1:22:02] then what does that do you being a part
[1:22:06] of god's gene
[1:22:07] a part of the word other men are part of
[1:22:09] god's word
[1:22:10] seated together manifest the entire body
[1:22:13] of christ
[1:22:14] because there's no leaven among you
[1:22:17] now living is sin all right you said
[1:22:20] well there's too much sin among us well
[1:22:22] god don't see sin if he didn't have to
[1:22:25] kill us
[1:22:26] come on come on we'll get under a lot of
[1:22:28] them things but there's
[1:22:29] no leaven among us now listen down here
[1:22:31] see what's talking about
[1:22:32] brother brown brown no leaven among you
[1:22:36] just the word only seated in heavenly
[1:22:39] places
[1:22:40] in the door where he put his name
[1:22:43] christ jesus no leaven among you
[1:22:46] that brings the entire fullness of the
[1:22:48] godhead bodily among you
[1:22:52] so if you want to know anything about
[1:22:54] bringing the fullness and getting the
[1:22:55] son of man it's what does he say no
[1:22:58] leaven
[1:23:00] among you that brings the entire
[1:23:02] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:23:03] couldn't do it in luther's age now
[1:23:06] listen to him
[1:23:07] remember the other night i was bringing
[1:23:08] this out couldn't do it in wesley's age
[1:23:10] couldn't do it in the pentecostal age
[1:23:13] this couldn't be brought forth what i'm
[1:23:15] talking about it's your prophet brought
[1:23:17] couldn't be brought forth back our
[1:23:18] that's what he's just saying
[1:23:22] look couldn't do it in the pentecostal
[1:23:25] but in a day when the son of man will be
[1:23:27] manifested
[1:23:29] and you sitting here a lot of you saw
[1:23:32] the manifestation or the ministry of the
[1:23:35] son of man
[1:23:36] you saw a prophet that could stop and
[1:23:38] turn his back
[1:23:40] all those things was there but that
[1:23:43] don't make him god
[1:23:48] but it's proof of the coming forth
[1:23:52] right but in the day when the son of man
[1:23:55] will be manifested revealed brought back
[1:23:57] the church
[1:23:58] together with the entire deity of god
[1:24:00] amongst his people
[1:24:06] see this message is the only way that
[1:24:09] you and i have any hope whatsoever
[1:24:14] but we've got to believe it's talking
[1:24:16] about us
[1:24:19] simple
[1:24:24] he tells us he lays it out in order this
[1:24:27] message couldn't come forth in luther's
[1:24:29] age
[1:24:30] right it couldn't come forth in wesley's
[1:24:33] age it couldn't come forth in the
[1:24:34] pentecostal age
[1:24:36] this message couldn't do it it had to
[1:24:38] wait until the prophet came on the scene
[1:24:40] malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10
[1:24:43] 7. that's right
[1:24:49] but see when we take this message and
[1:24:51] receive it and believe it
[1:24:53] then the bride will be standing on earth
[1:24:55] as the son of man
[1:24:57] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:25:03] he said brother dale don't that thrill
[1:25:05] you to think you preached that in 69
[1:25:07] it does for one thing it thrills me to
[1:25:10] the fact of knowing that
[1:25:12] god done it and revealed it and showed
[1:25:15] it through the prophet
[1:25:17] but it don't exalt me whatsoever it
[1:25:19] takes me down
[1:25:22] because any revelation you've got takes
[1:25:24] you up you're in bad shape that
[1:25:26] is not a revelation from god a
[1:25:28] revelation of god would automatically
[1:25:29] carry you down
[1:25:31] you'll become very humble with it you'll
[1:25:33] you'll walk in the light of it
[1:25:34] you'll glory in it you want glory in
[1:25:38] yourself
[1:25:40] when we see it okay let's see if i can
[1:25:43] get these next two and then we'll quit
[1:25:45] okay go ahead number 21.
[1:25:47] christ when he was on earth was the body
[1:25:49] of god god created his body
[1:25:51] going on down let's pick up this part
[1:25:52] all that god was was in christ he was
[1:25:55] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:25:56] that's what the scripture says now and
[1:25:58] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:26:01] he was emmanuel god with us and all that
[1:26:04] christ was he poured
[1:26:05] into the church what is it anointed ones
[1:26:08] to continue his work
[1:26:10] that his word might live
[1:26:14] constantly okay go to the last one
[1:26:21] talking about the deity veiled in human
[1:26:22] flesh hebrews 1
[1:26:24] and also genesis 18 remember god was a
[1:26:26] man standing there
[1:26:28] eating and talking with abraham and told
[1:26:31] what sarah was going come on musicians
[1:26:33] and doing in the tent behind it and
[1:26:35] jesus said as
[1:26:36] it was in the days of sodom so shall it
[1:26:39] be at the coming of the son of man
[1:26:40] deity veiled again in human flesh
[1:26:44] now remember jesus didn't say when the
[1:26:46] son of god
[1:26:47] is being revealed in luke 17th chapter
[1:26:50] i believe it in about the 30th first
[1:26:53] somewhere along in there
[1:26:54] and when the son of man is being
[1:26:56] revealed the son of man
[1:26:58] back in the church again
[1:27:03] back in the church again
[1:27:08] revealed in human beings not son of god
[1:27:12] but the son of man again back in his
[1:27:14] church again
[1:27:15] in the last days and we find what it's
[1:27:18] promised
[1:27:21] take these home and read them
[1:27:25] i didn't write the book
[1:27:30] i gave you what the prophet had to say
[1:27:33] but are we going to believe it are we
[1:27:36] going to believe who
[1:27:37] what god says we are
[1:27:41] you know that your salvation is based
[1:27:43] upon what god has said
[1:27:49] and really it's what god said about you
[1:27:53] your salvation is based upon what god
[1:27:55] has said but i don't see these great
[1:28:01] miracles and signs and wonders
[1:28:11] if one person is healed
[1:28:14] that's a great miracle if one person is
[1:28:18] saved
[1:28:19] that is a great miracle
[1:28:25] we are seeing church but you're not
[1:28:27] paying no attention to it
[1:28:34] we've got a woman in the white house
[1:28:37] that's thus
[1:28:38] saith the lord right because that's what
[1:28:41] he said would take place
[1:28:44] but do we believe it do we believe
[1:28:46] that's the sign of the end
[1:28:54] i don't look for no tribulation no the
[1:28:56] bride don't go through tribulation
[1:28:57] but there is a pre-tribulation to strike
[1:29:02] a preacher revelation can be pretty bad
[1:29:04] the only difference in a pre-tribulation
[1:29:06] and a tribulation
[1:29:07] re if you'll take it and just listen and
[1:29:10] you'll find the prophet saying it
[1:29:12] tribulation means the wrath
[1:29:15] of god is poured out
[1:29:18] that's what tribulation means
[1:29:21] tribulation for patience that we have
[1:29:23] with one another or whatever we do
[1:29:25] or or things like that are that's not
[1:29:29] the wrath of god being poured out
[1:29:33] if you think these things are horrible
[1:29:35] wait till the wrath is poured out
[1:29:37] when there's no way for you to be able
[1:29:39] to pray for
[1:29:40] your sicknesses or anything
[1:29:44] because remember if the wrath is poured
[1:29:46] out on the gentile dispensation you're
[1:29:49] already in the tribulation yes
[1:29:51] and you are lost
[1:29:54] the only thing you can do there is give
[1:29:56] your life for the gospel and hope for a
[1:29:58] salvation of
[1:29:59] a foolish virgin
[1:30:02] that can happen but who wants to try it
[1:30:05] on a foolish version
[1:30:07] why would we want to try it when we've
[1:30:08] got the word
[1:30:14] understand think on these things
[1:30:18] take these quotes and just read them
[1:30:21] and see what the prophet has said
[1:30:25] this is not what brother dale has said
[1:30:28] or anything it is not what brother
[1:30:30] branham has said
[1:30:31] it is what god has used to speak through
[1:30:34] brother branham to bring to you and i
[1:30:36] yes
[1:30:38] amen
[1:30:41] but do you believe it's possible
[1:30:44] for the bride of christ to be
[1:30:47] the fullness of the godhead bodily if
[1:30:49] you don't then you're going to have to
[1:30:50] deny every one of these quotes we just
[1:30:52] read
[1:30:53] if you believe that the son of man can
[1:30:55] be the word made flesh in the entire
[1:30:57] body of christ
[1:30:58] then there's hope for us and a change of
[1:31:00] the body if
[1:31:02] not there's no hope it's left up to us
[1:31:05] to believe it
[1:31:09] well i don't see it well what are you
[1:31:10] looking for who's got it
[1:31:16] i don't see nobody's got it but oh ain't
