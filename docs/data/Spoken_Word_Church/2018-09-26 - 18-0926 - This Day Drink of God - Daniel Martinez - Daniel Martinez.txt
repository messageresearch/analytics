praying for the little church in Espanola we believe that God Almighty is working in this bride all over the nation so we were grateful for that and we realized that that there's a lot of things being said but we realized that it's all in his hands everything's all in his hands let's um let's first of all go to the scriptures let's go in Jeremiah the second chapter and the and 12th 12th verse Jeremiah second chapter the twelfth verse be astonished oh ye heavens at this and be Oh what's that word horror or horribly afraid ye be e-every desolate saith the lord for the for my people have committed two evils even they have forsaken me the fountain of living water and have hewed unto them cisterns broken cisterns that can can that can not that can hold no water amen let's go before the Lord in prayer our dear and precious Lord we come before you Lord Jesus and Lord God we recognize Lord that you are the living water Lord Jesus you are the fountain of life Lord God you're the only

that are of your word or God and Lord Jesus we pray O Lord God that you bless your people Lord this afternoon blessed me also Lord Jesus as we come to hear from you in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated amen and this scripture this little scripture that we refer to here is the scripture brother Branham gave in the in the in the sermon broken cisterns and I want a got a little idea I want to talk about and it's about you know just funny finding out where we draw our energy or power from where we where we can tap into and receive life and you know going through a little testimony of what happened to me there you know as I went and I I never I didn't brother the brother Billy Canada but Joseph explained to me that nowadays everything's electronically controlled nowadays your power grid and all this stuff is he like trying to be controlled you can stand here with your iPhone and adjust the temperature in your house you can stand here and your and turn off the lights on some houses you know and and things like that well and Timothy told me he says you know I had a he says they're actually showing me how much power I'm using you know I said well I can't put in the main the main breaker if I don't if I have power they're a little shocked me I said so I'm gonna remove the meter and quickly put it back on after I get it on no sooner did I do that and we ran for a main breaker but then we got back it was red-tagged oh no what are we gonna do so what are we gonna do now how are we gonna get the power back on you know we're gonna have to call it electrician we're gonna have to do a lot of things to get all squared away so nervous as I was I went ahead and started putting the box on and then Timothy says you know what it's it's fuel you're you're gonna we're gonna have to call her electrician we're gonna have to go through a lot of things you're trying to get this grandfathered in and it's not gonna grandfather it now gives you you're gonna have to put everything new and they're gonna go through the whole house and do have to do fix everything so I was nervous and I I worked a little while on and I says you know what let's just go home so I left the power box there and the main breaker on and I says well call in the morning and find out what it's gonna take to get the power on we'll have to hire an electrician I guess well during the night I was nervous I couldn't sleep and now I was just starting to finally fell asleep and I had a dream and in this dream my pastor's friend came over this is interesting about how pasture is you know that you can you you know you realize you can call on your pasture and you know there's a little story about Hannah Hannah in the Bible Hannah and the Bible was there was a man named Eli who wasn't even a good pasture wasn't even a good priest he wasn't taken he wasn't control you know taking care of the house of the Lord he was he was actually putting a blind eye to what his kids were doing and not taking him off the priesthood and all this stuff he was just and and the Lord required it of him but yet a little girl named Hannah comes up and she's praying asking God to have a baby and she he gets up there and he accuses her of being drunken and she says don't don't don't accuse me of that kind of thing I'm crying out to the Lord and he is coming he is comment one little comment that he made was made Lord give you what you're asking and she turned around and went home could see the baby and had the baby what was that it's respect respect for the office respect for the office and the power of God can move through there whether you agree with the man or not respect him and you'll find out God's Park you move through there so you watch so nevertheless the office so I had a dream about my pastor in here and and and one of his friends who was an inspector elect electrical inspector in New Mexico in the dream was standing there and he says no he says just go ahead and hook up the way you were planning to in the dream go ahead and hook it all up the way you're planning to and and I'll get the power turned to back on for you I says oh wow I wake up and ice is all Lord if it was only so how could this happen you know if it was only so so I don't know what Tim said to the power people and I don't know what but all of sudden he calls up and he says they're gonna find this a hundred bucks okay that's not bad and twenty bucks to come and put it back on okay and they're gonna hook it up with no questions asked what no electrician or nothing so I'm there I got up early in the morning couldn't sleep early in the morning I got up there and I was already putting the thing together and he calls up and you know about four hours later and tells me this so I just finished hooking everything I've got the power box up already we're ready to go the people people came up drove up put the meter back in power went on I turned the switches all on they all work great and no questions as well praise the Lord you know and then I realized the scripture says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord so you know I'm not trying to do anything illegal but I'm only trying to you know I'm trying to get my son up and going so I'm glad that the Lord's mindful of us you know that just really really realized that you know so so the Lord's been merciful to me and I'm so grateful amen and so going back to the scripture we're talking about and and what we're looking at is you know when we when we see that you know it rains a lot here I had noticed that it's been raining and you know we always praise God showers of blessings amen and inside where the Holy Spirit moves we receive showers of blessings and it's still a blessing to us amen as the Holy Spirit moves like I heard in the song service as the power of God moves through here I realize they're showers of blessings but when brother Branham was talking about broken cisterns he's talking about the places like New Mexico it doesn't rain very much and out there in New Mexico since it doesn't rain very much they take and they use big old sometimes that you can't be driving through the wilderness and in order to feed the deer and the elk water they'll put a roof tin roof and they'll leading it all down and they'll put gutters on this roof it's no more than this high and you walked up to it and you say well what is this thing and it's just a tin roof and they have a gutter on it and it runs to a little tank and you walk over to the tank and the elk have been there there's a lot of track around it the up tube in there drinking water and animals have been drinking water there and and sometimes if it's raining enough it overflows but almost never overflowing but they drink out of there and you know notice that that it's pretty it's pretty nasty water and brother Brown explains that in their broken sisters tape eating bowls on telling you how you know they they would put a filter on this thing coming off the barn roof and of course the barn the cattle cattle running though in the barn when yours in the barn and they step and dust comes up at dry seasons the dust comes up and settles on the roof then the rain washes it all down into the cistern and people go in there to get there they're cooking water and they're in their water for drinking and their water for cleaning and all that out of the cistern because there's no real well made they're there they're saving water as much as they can and he says sure they can filter out the bugs and stuff but but where does the bug juices go you know after and I've seen I've seen a lot of bugs have been laying in the water a long time pretty soon there's hardly any bug and mostly juice you know so it gets to be where and Bradley Brown types all this stuff as the denominational system and he says you know what it's all going to be the mark of the beast and I was listening to another tape where brother Brown was talking a little bit about the mark of the beast and he said that that all those demons and this was in the in the tape Feast of the trumpets he says all those demons that were bound up in the river Euphrates he says those demons came back to in this day and age and anointed Hitler with that Roman system when they're killing Christians and actually went in after the Jews and I thought wow I said so all these demons were loosed upon the upon the world and and and and they came in after the attitude control control the the they came in and did the same thing they were doing to the Christians well they were putting him to death and they were killing off the Jews but then I started thinking a little bit about the you know when when when every time that you find out that when somebody gets this kind of influence or this kind of energy or that kind of power that comes out there's a move you know you're this move that came through there's a there's a power to resist it brother branham brother Dale was talking about the powers that were resisting all the Satan's powers that he put forth in the seals okay and you start to see that this this energy that came out there the time of the of the sixth seal you find out that they were they were killing the Jews and and and yet there there was there was a resistance there a power to resist and which which it didn't ended up moving over that same power had to move over to where it was you know when Hitler's wasn't what Hitler lost the battle and all and all that the demons didn't die they still moved over and brother Brown called it that they moved over to the clergy and the clergy was moving over to it a denominational system and that denominational system is still that old stagnant water that's coming from an old cistern where they're trying to and and and what does it do it kind of attracts wiggle tails in it and and it attracts frogs and it attracts tadpoles and salamanders and all these kind of things that that are attracted to stagnant waters and you find out that the the world is all moving towards this power that's that these powers that be and you'll start just notice that you know if you notice in the politics around when you notice all the politicians and the things that they're trying to influence they're trying to push towards the one world system though and you start to say well you know what we do have like you say there they were all excited about the about the y2k thing and saying oh everything's gonna shut down and we better have generators and this and that and you start to find out that hey there's a truth to it but yet there's not a truth to it nobody had to go have all these generators and things but there the truth is is electronically they're watching where you're spending your money they're watching where your credit card is pushed you know my wife gets us a signal every time I spend a dollar you know so she gets it on her phone nice as well I says you're watching me rather close and and I says well it doesn't matter I says I'm not afraid I shamed or afraid for her to know where where I'm spending my money but the thing is it's very very subtle but really quick to respond and you start to notice that in this day and age we live in they're gonna know where you're at what you're doing yeah you you you can't just get off the grid and you find out that there that there's a if you're going to if you're going to have any kind of a chance you know when the squeeze comes on they're good they'll know where you're at so the only place that you can find any relief from the from the the powers that are out there is sheltered when you're sheltered you know I had a friend one time they said III all right as soon as I get my check I take it all in cash that way they can't follow me they can't trace me I got it all in cash so and and and they says well you know and I don't use a credit card and I don't use that and I don't use that so they get so they can't follow me and they can't trace where I'm at what I'm doing I says why are you so worried about Big Brother Isis if you're looking if you're looking to to to get off the grid if you're looking to to to be a you know there's a friend of mine that that says well we at the time of Obama he was saving gun saving bullets and saving and getting getting guns stocked up and everything he says I got I'm gonna run up to the woods and be in a militia if in case if in case this guy goes too radical I says you know some people they take these scriptures and the things that God has said is gonna be and they take it so carnal that they don't recognize any of the truth that's gone in in our day and age they if they'd only had the message they only have the truth that's coming our day and age we the privileged people have been drinking from the fountain of life we've been we've been acknowledging the the massive message of this hour that the truth that God's given us in our day and age and we start to look and we start to see that in the word when we look at the word when we look at the way nations are going and how the how the powers of God are going you look at there I was I was looking at revelations 13 11 the mark of the beast let's go over there real quick and actually I was reading where it refers to America in Revelations 11 and I have a year it says religious it says and I beheld another beast came up out of the earth and it and he had two horns like a lamb but spake as the dragon and we know the dragon is Rome so brother Brown called that the USA the United States is coming into a power now we start to worry wonder where is we recognize that in this in the sixth seal when I'm in the sixth seal when the persecution came on the Jews that those spirits were released where are they today they're still they're still here but now it's become a power where there's a uniting time amongst the the world to get everybody into a war one world system and we realize that as Christians we have to be in Christ Jesus drinking from the fountain of life to be able to recognize that that that the the things that God has prophesied in our day and age are bringing us to a place where we can be a people of faith bringing us to a place where we can recognize who we are and what we're standing for you know we looked at the at some of the prophecies the self-driving car they've already got the self-driving car they I think the the what does that call the the electric car that's now out there that has an option where you can just take your hands off the wheel and it'll go almost down the street what's the name of the car the Tesla can already go down this streets without driving without holding your hands on a car and holding your hands on the steering wheel they still require you to sit at the seat but let you can let the car drive itself and the Google card they're saying that the new Google cars and several of the cars coming up aren't even going to have a steering wheel you can put your back towards what that seat can be turned away from the steering wheel area they'll be there that they're being tested in several places and uber I think is already using the this technology to to pick up and and drop off people and on their rentals so you start to see that the the the the self-driving car may be that it's not shaped like an egg maybe one question but you start to see that the technology is there so we start to see that hey this day we sit here and say that scripture is fulfilled in our day when we see it when we got a chance to see that well another thing I saw that went you know back when when when Israel became a nation when Israel became a nation and Israel took back over Jerusalem it caused me to just hunger and thirst I went through Daniels 70 weeks again I wanted I wanted to know what what time we're living in I thought the coming of Lord I thought those bombs were gonna fly in the last vision that Billy Brown was talking about because I knew that I work in Los Alamos where they're making these things so I really thought that we were coming at the end end of it all at that time I didn't work there but I ended up working there but you see we start to look and we start to see that almighty God's Word is coming to pass step by step whether we whether we put our efforts to it no matter what we do we can turn a blind eye to it it still comes to pass the Word of God is going to come to pass and in when we start to look at at the work at how God Almighty God was is going to manifest himself in our day and age when we start to look at our our part to play in this economy of God when we start to look at where we are we can see where the denominations are going we can see where the where the prophecies are heading we can see where the where the where the the the Word of God is taking but we start to look taking taking the the world but we start to look at where's the Word of God taking us as a people as a people that believe the message of this hour what's the Word of God taking us to well how can we how can we be the the people of faith how can we have the faith that was once delivered to the Saints we start to realize our part to play is to believe God how can we have faith in God you know you know Moses when he was standing there at the at the Brinks of the Red Sea that people were saying well the soldiers are coming after us let's just deliver Moses to him so that so you know so that they'll spare us they're already talking about delivering Moses to the Egyptians throw him out there in the front of them you know so that they won't kill us all and we'll go back and serve the Egyptians as slaves you know take the leader and just throw him out there and Moses says you know they're talking about these things that he got over there behind the rock and he started to pray and and let's go over to Exodus 14 I think it's 14 15 and Moses stood there it says all right and the Lord said unto Moses for for cras thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but lift up your rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea you see we as message believers now your Moses you're like Moses you know well you come to the place where you start to realize you know I have a commission here you know God's called me to a work God's called you to a work God's called you to a work to believe what he said God's called you you said well oh I try to get up in the morning and all my feet ache oh I get crabs on bruised I'm hurting III I'm struggling you know all day just it's hard you know old age is rough don't get old you young kids yeah you know and you start to realize you know what I get up in the morning yeah it hurts my feet hurt my legs hurt my shoulders hurt my arms hurt sometimes I sleep and I'm waking up with her yeah but you know what I I wake up and I said Lord you gave Joshua the opportunity of coming into old age and never losing an ounce of his strength and I believe the same things given to me as bright as your bride I believe your words calling me to a higher calling I believe it's letting me wrecks perience but I can believe and I can have I can pray and I can ask God Lord I don't believe the pain and by golly I'll get up whether it hurts or not you know I'll go I'll twist that muscle whether it's got the strength or not you know while back I was working on David's house my boys house over there in in in New Mexico and for some reason I started noticing that my arms are just losing strength and I didn't have no muscle anymore my muscles were gone and this is what's going on you know why is my muscles disappearing and stuff and I'm getting weaker and weaker and weaker and I come up to that three story I mean it's a it's a two-story house with with the pitch the roof so I get to that pitch of that roof and I look up there and there's like six or about three scaffolds for scaffolds hi and I says I gotta get up there I don't got no muscle to get up there my arms are weak so I grab hold of the scaffolding one two three four and then it i forgot this i forgot back up again so you say well where did your strength come from I don't know I believe it's from God whether I have it or not I'll use it because I believe God promised me that I can be whole well ho wholesome amen so I I I forced myself up and down that ladder and you know what eventually I started noticing my arms are coming back my arms are coming back but my strength did not leave me you say why because I have faith that's why I didn't go to no doctor I didn't go to check up on anything but I believe I don't have to drink from any broken cistern I can't believe I can believe that I can drink from that fountain of life I can drink from the Word of God that has promised me exceeded and precious promises it promises me my strength if I can see that Joshua at it I can have it all the way if I go by way of the grave I'll have it or I go by way of the change of the body I'll still have it amen so excuse me so I recognize you know that that that the Commission I have the Commission this bride has it's not to lay our and play dead you know the first church age that had to go into the ground yeah they had to go into the ground that was prophesied of them they had to give their lives but this last church age isn't going to do that she's got a third full ministry it's a different calling it's a different truth it's a different promise and we have a promise to be the Bride of Christ that by faith can at the word of God and say this is my possession this is something that belongs to me I don't have to drink of that broken cistern and say well oh I guess I have to have my pains and aches I don't I don't any and if any that's what like like what I'm telling you about Moses you see God was telling him Moses you have it in you I called you to this work speak speak and you learn you as people you as mrs. believers you that take whole this word you then listen to those tapes you can speak speak what you're asking God to do for you and he'll do it why because it's his promises exceeding and precious promises that have been given to this bride for this last day amen they know we don't have you know in the wilderness you start to look at in the wilderness you know when they were after they went to the Red Sea and God parted the Red Sea but you'll notice that in the wilderness they were going from dry lakebed to dry lakebed and they couldn't find no water and the driest place in the desert is one rock sitting out in the Sun you know and Moses comes and God tells him smite the rock he smites the rockin out of the driest place in the whole desert a hot rock poured out rivers of water the type of Christ you know the type of Christ the smitten rock poured out water so and if you look at the masterpiece Billy brown said that's smite in that masterpiece it says that's the smiting of the masterpiece produced the rivers the water of life so why what is it we're standing here for we're looking at the Word of God we're looking at what he's promised in his word and we're realizing hey I got a promise I got a commission God's called me to a higher calling God's called me to a deeper work God's called me to believe his word and by believing his word I can take possession of what God has given in this last days I'm living in a day when the Holy Spirit wants to pour through me more than once to pour through you wants to pour through me more than I want to receive it and pour it through me he wants to move himself through you and and and and and let that that that water move through you the Word of God in the faith that was once delivered to the Saints to pour through you to manifest itself hallelujah we still stand on a day and age when the Word of God has become so real that we we look at that that old story of brother Brown saying about the worst revival in the world revival they go to investigate what the world revival was and that policeman says it's in me it's in me the Holy Spirit's in you because he promised to be in you and that Holy Spirit is the fountain of life that Holy Spirit is a manifestation of God's Word in our day and age amen so we start to look at we're not going to rest on the on the on the we we look at that smitten rock and we realize this Jesus and we notice that in there is our healing its salvation it's our it's repentance it's a life-changing event you know like Peter one time let me read a little bit about that story I'm Peter st. Luke 23 32 and I was looking for that other place because there's another reference to this but I couldn't find it but Peter he was it was well remembered okay let me read this here it says would three I mean 3232 I mean where am I looking at st. Luke 32 30 23 I don't know I'm just lexing so I must have written it backwards obviously let me see it st. Luke mmm I did market here it's a same Duke almost 123 where he was telling Peter that that you would he would deny him three times that's Simon Simon here it is 31 31 32 of st. Luke 22 okay and the Lord said Simon Simon and he and Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you - to have you that you he may sift you as wheat but when but I have prayed for thee that thy faith faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren that's strange now let's take a look at Peter for one thing Peter had already told the Lord thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God that event had happened and Jesus said you're that you have the key okay and then here he comes down to the getting close to crucifixion and at the at the Last Supper and and Jesus tells him when you're repented you mean he had these great revelations and he wasn't even repented yet well then he when he went through the through the trial of denying Jesus those three times could you imagine Peter almost every morning when the crows how he felt remembering what he did to the Lord right you know it must have been really hard for him all through life from there on in but it also brought him to a place where even his shadow walking across a sick person a sick person would get up what made him so different what made him where was the virtue coming out of him from because within him was that holy spirit and that holy spirit so moving in him that he would he was he was so willing to to give his life for God after that that he would he asked them to prettify him upside down it's the history says that but then I remember and I just I was looking for this scripture but I didn't find it it said where Peter where Jesus had just raised from the dead and he goes go tell my brother and go tell the Brethren and Peter he reminded them to remind Peter well Peter wasn't Peter was probably really broken up at that moment but Jesus was mindful of him mindful of what he was going to and what if what a feeling when he found him once again raised from the dead we realize we realize that we too are have have come to the place where where we were where we recognize we've we've come to the place where we recognize that our life is nothing but our life in Christ is everything this bride is the Bride of Christ ministry but your call to us as believers in this Word of God that's coming our day and age to take him at his promises and to bring you back to the original word that was once delivered to the Saints is everything it's everything it's it's what the whole world is is waiting for amen brother was telling us about the about the resurrection and you start to realize they without us if you go to Hebrews you find out they without us can't be made perfect they need us they need us to be in that perfection that was once delivered to the Saints they need us in the book of Acts they need us having faith in believing God believe in his word taking him at his promise claiming it already said about us claiming what he said to us and speaking the word amen you start to realize that amen the woman at the well st. John 4:7 I don't think I gave that to them back there st. John 4:7 for seven and Jesus I said for seven oh four thirteen and jesus answered and said unto her whosoever shall drink of this water shall thirst again but whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up to eternal life to everlasting life we start to realize what is this it's the Holy Ghost that God's given to us in this day and age the Holy Ghost that has brought us to a reality of a Word of God that's been presented to us as a living sacrifice a living manifestation something that's been given to us it's God Almighty coming down to live in you and wanting you to speak his word wanting you to manifest the third Pole amen and how can we manifest the third pole it's by taking in its faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the Word of God as you take in the Word of God it brings you to a higher calling hallelujah we realized that Almighty God's bringing us to - to - to catch the vision you know one time there was a you know the Catholic Church people they they have they called visions of Mary they say and they said that one in one place in a desert place that Mary appeared and water started flowing out from a rock well they put a statue there and and that's very same place and it happens to be a city has grown around that area and and they and the water continues flowing out of the rock well there was a guy walking over there and this is the it was around it was over there in in where is it Vatican City or someplace over there in Rome there's a guy walking around looking and and and and people are getting bottles of water and halting at home and taking holy water from there and he started looking closer and he saw that there was a copper pipe sticking out of the ground they were getting city water and given a Terry buddy and it's not to myself that that sounds like our own house back home and in our place we have a place called the Sun twaddle and in this Sun tois Rio there's a there's a spot that they call it holy dirt well everybody gets this holy dirt and there's there's stories and and and and a bunch of what do they call those crutches hanging on the wall with their stories and all that laying around there and I went in there just look at the old sanctuary the old church it was and I look in there and I see all those things and I read a couple of and I says Wow I says people really have faith in this dirt and they keep taking the dirt and taking the dirt out of this hole in their little cups and I thought wow I says well that you know they I guess if they have faith in that dirt I guess they're it's okay but then I find out later on that a friend of mine was was was used to walk barefoot down there to the Sun patio and and and and and and worship there he was real Catholic and one day he was walking barefoot through the oils there and behind the church and he saw an old man picking up a couple of sacks of dirt and he says what do you do with that dirt he says all that people take so much dirt out of that hole I have to fill the hole back up and they all think it's a miracle that the dirt never runs out well you see what it is is this isn't a put-on there's nothin put-on about this message of this hour this truth that's been given us it's given to you you know our brother Branham was was called and they told him we a friend of yours has just gotten his his he got crushed his spleen is broken his livers busted he says he got crushed was almost two tons of weight and over his back or something like that and his liver and spleen are busted out and he's in the hospital he's asking you to come pray for him and brother Brown says well who might ago pray for him he says I haven't had a vision or anything he's talking to his wife and he says I haven't had a vision or anything how can I go just pray for the brother the the man he says you know if Jesus was here he says his hand he's got holy hands he would come down here and he'd he'd lay hands on him and the brother would just rise up he says but who am i he says I'm a sinner I'm I'm born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking life Who am I and how could I put my filthy hands on this man and and and raise him up I'm nobody I'm just as bad as he is as far as sin is concerned and all he says I'm nobody but if I had a vision he's talking to his wife he's but if I had a vision then I know God was sending me to go do it and and then he started think he's is but it's the same filthy hands he says it's the same filthy hands and then he says and you know what the Scriptures promises lay your hands on the sick and the sick will recovery it didn't say whether you had holy hands or not it just says lay your hands on the sick so he says I'm going and he went over there to the hospital he prayed for the man and within the week the brother was in church so you start to look this is if you take him at his promise his promises are in your were in the word his promises are given to you if you take him at his promises you got the right to lay your hands on the sick and the sick will recover you got the right to to put it this way the Apostle Paul took a prayer cloth and sent it off to the sick you got the right to grab a prayer cloth send it off to the sick you know I had I had one of the prayer cloths here my Bible that brother Brennan prayed for the brother that brother should I say Perry Greene had had given to us when he was here in Georgia and and I thought wow it's a perk thought that brother Branham had and my wife says you look at that / cloth like you're a Catholic I says no I don't look at it but brother Branham did pray for it pray on it for the sick and afflicted and and you know I thought about that prayer cloth and stuff and you know what I don't need that prayer cloth particularly I need to believe the word and I will pray over a cloth and send it to the sick of the fight and they'll get well because we take we take him at his word what Paul could do brother Branham could do what Paul can do brother Branham could do and the bride can do because they are got the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead it dwells in you amen so let's stand to our feet as we go before the Lord in prayer amen I just wanna admonish the Bride of Christ to take him at his promises we realize
