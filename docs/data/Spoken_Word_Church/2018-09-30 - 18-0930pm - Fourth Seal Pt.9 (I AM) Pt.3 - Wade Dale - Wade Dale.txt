but that's okay I mean that's all right I'll just wasn't expecting it but boy they do a good job though if anything ever happens to us you know they're right there the thing can just flow right on in we ain't got to worry about it all right so I'm glad that we're doing that that's that means that we all love us to be instant in season out of season say anybody can lead you know get us going so but some of you take note of that too fifteen fifteen minute song service we had all this needed there was just any help all right remember Bible study six o'clock next Saturday I think Terence announced or you know he didn't know it's this afternoon but October 27th will be the Fall Festival we'll have the games and stuff we need to get together and get those things back out and get them together but October 27th starting at one time we say one o'clock one o'clock well this was last weekend when do you forget oh I walked over the 12th through the 14th No okay well I'll add this to my list let me get to my list first offense okay I'm getting them Alissa thank you if I do this first and I'll do this okay remember Jim's he's leaving today to go to her dad's she debate teams to evening so give her traveling mercies and also will let just give you just a word of announcement how many of you would give your most important keys to child so don't give the keys to the playground to a child everybody understand that you got that somebody gave the keys to a child last Sunday and they unlock the playground and we lock the playground back and the keys were still in the playground and we only have one extra set and Joshes got it so without him you hadn't gotten the playground so adults do not give the keys to a child to unlock the playground give it to an adult and then go hang it back up just just a word of just a word of caution just don't do that anymore you wouldn't give the keys to your house to your child right I didn't think so all right now by way of announcement from Hickory Bible Tabernacle which is him which is in Newton North Carolina who is this is this very coffee okay this is brother berry coffees having a meeting October 12th through the 14th at the at his church special guest speakers brother Aaron McGarry good brother brother Jason Watkins good brother brother Paul off fontaine so that will be August 12th through the 14th at Hickory Bible Tabernacle if anybody wants to go here is all the information up here service times Friday at 7:00 Saturday at 10:00 and 7:00 and Sunday at 10:30 so if you can't go let's pray for him anyway I mean good to be in the house of Lord let's turn our Bibles to revelations chapter 6 continue our thought we had thought we might try to take it on to the son of man but I think we need to cover one more little point before we do and this will be I am the resurrection and the life part 3 we really hadn't got to that but remember as we were talking about last Sunday we must see a full restoration before you can even talk about a resurrection must be a full restoration because that there's been no when you say resurrection sure we've had resurrections I mean a permanent resurrection which means those people um Lazarus did not receive a permanent resurrection he was a temporary resurrection because he died again we're talking about this resurrection where there won't be any dying anymore amen so that's the resurrection that we're talking about because I want to show you two that we're brother Branham told us many times but it's been in the Bible forever that we're we're sitting in heavenly places as we speak today even all right so let's go to the Lord in prayer revelation 6 we're on the fourth seal everything culminates on this fourth seal for the Gentile what we called our Gentile age right there because there is more for everybody else there's more for the world there's more for the Jews there's more for the you know you got your millennium you got all these things but for the Gentile dispensation to be over there must be a resurrection full restoration or resurrection body change in a rapture alright okay and that will happen on this side on earth I believe it'll happen where we can see it I don't want to do I don't want to put it off like grandma well it's you know Lord's coming no he's here I always thought that the Lord was here you know we just got to realize that so let's pray you how many father we pray Lord that you will be with us today be the active participant in this service Lord you'd be the one that does the speaking but you wanted to does the hearing father just take care of the things that are all the things that the world Lord made just be shut off for a little while and as the as the priest that of old went behind the veil and the prophet of God told us that that curtain was there when that curtain shut the whole world was was blocked out he couldn't hear or see anything but you Lord the Shekinah glory that come down Lord and anointed that temple where lord now we know that that Shekinah glory is not in a physical temple as it would be wood and stone but it has moved into flesh and now Lord we come boldly to the throne and the petition of all the ones that are sick Lord that you would be with them that you would touch their bodies father the ones that are on the highways ones we're going to be on the highways Lord we pray that you'd be with them father take care of us now in this service anoint us for this journey Lord that we just think in a minute ago it's been a long journey for some but Lord it's all going to culminate one day to where that journey is gonna end and we're gonna live with you for an eternity Father forgive us Lord of our sins and bless us in Jesus name we pray amen and always bless the missionaries when the foreign field give them fruit for their labor when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and I looked and behold a pale horse and him he his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with a sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word let's go ahead and go to Joel let's go ahead and read those I like to read them because it really I think it maybe gets our mind in in order that that this is not a prophecy now this is a reality when it was written in Joel that was a prophecy Joel prophesied even when Peter comes up on the day of Pentecost and says this is that that was fulfilling that part of a prophecy but it wasn't fulfilling the whole prophecy cause back when Papa when Peter stood up and said this is down on the day of Pentecost a full restoration had begun but it had not come to full fruition okay it was in motion but it had not come to the apex and the apex is the statue of a perfect man with the headstone on the pyramid amen that all right so let's read Joel be glad you children of John resign and rejoice in the Lord your God we have given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former and the latter rain in the first month the floor shall be full of wheat the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I restore to you that's personally didn't say I was to them it says to you I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm caterpillar Palma worm my great army which I sent among you and you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wonderfully with you and my people she'll never be ashame let's read John 12 23 through 24 and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i saying to you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die the son of man could not be glorified now that's before that's really what it's saying right son of man cannot be glorified but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit all right and Jesus said the hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified my brother Dale was talking about this morning we we have to bring the son of man is is the headstone and then the son of man is God in human flesh amen here not in another dimension but here amen and like we like we always say it's the capstone this looks just like a pyramid there's your pyramid there's your head and some of you know I want to bring it out just as easy as I can some of you last Sunday we're looking a little cross-eyed at me when I said Jesus didn't restore all things I read you the Bible that said he did but let me ask you a question talking about the Bible study this murder sentence cool this morning if Jesus came to restore all things when Jesus came out of the tomb what did he say all power in heaven and earth has been given unto me if he was if it not he was lying it's all power in other words before he before he was in the grave he had a flesh body that was human just like me in you right and it was deteriorating it was dying all right and then also he didn't know all things because when he went to the mountain only a prophet of God could tell us that why Moses and Elijah was there you remember what the Prophet said they were telling telling him about his second coming what is his second coming this coming hey man so they were telling him about that coming so there were certain things that he didn't know but when he stepped out of that tomb he had a flesh body that was glorified it can move between dimensions because remember our flesh body cannot move between dimensions brother branham's body was laying on the bed and he went into another dimension history - he did but he had to leave his flesh that mom and daddy brought had to stay in the ground that okay but Jesus walked out of the tomb he said all power and Hitler has been given unto me why didn't he just step over into another dimension and just take the devil and go put he's God he has all power he has no limitations why didn't he just go over and zap the devil amen don't you think like that way he said oh pound then they fit with me I said buddy we're done with you I can get rid of you right now but why did he not cuz he was not the one to restore all things he was not the one to restore all things he was the one to start the restoration but he was not the one to restore the Bible said even Jesus himself when he came down off the mountain he said surely Elijah will come and restore all things so it was given to a man the message was given to a man it had to be a man in human flesh amen we'll get into something in a minute that all right so just think about that though Jesus was not he made the way sure it's all got to do with Jesus all of it has to do with him without him nothing it hinges all on him but he transferred that power to somebody else because he knows he defeats the devil actually to him the devil's already defeated he created him so who's it left to its left to the bride it's left to the son of man the word in human flesh we'll look at it in just a minute I just want to give you something to maybe keep you a little bit away we may have to do German chocolate cake today we'll see man Lisa made some of the other day it was good John 11 Jesus said 25 says I am the resurrection and the life don't skip some of that he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever then believeth in me shall never die believe us now this all right amen believe it I am the resurrection and the life in other words mark that was saying Lord I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day she was doing just like everybody else she was pushing it forward to the future putting it on somebody else's shoulder and then Lord I know he'll raised at the last day and Jesus I'm sure Jesus just looked at her and said I'm the resurrection why are you looking for a later time I am the resurrection in the life but see that's what we got to see that if we're according to Romans 8 if we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ the joint heir that we get is what he got if he said I am the resurrection and the life we're heading toward that who said that the son of man said that the son of man stood on earth in a flesh body that was dying and said I am the resurrection and the life what part of that can we not see believe it's now this amen believe us now this that you and I have a part in this listen this whole resurrection thing hinges on a bride coming to perfection coming to arrest full restoration then all right men because Jesus made the way honestly he will ease the way the truth in the life he came remember remember brother Branham said he said Jesus didn't come to bring you an inheritance I've read that quote a hundred times Jesus did not come to bring you an inheritance he came to make a way to you to get back to your inheritance which our inheritance is that Genesis 1:26 man back before there was a fall that's what he gave us he gave us a way to get back to that because the way was lost in the garden so Jesus give us the way to get by but the way to get back is yeah it's him but it's through human flesh but not his flesh what a better way to defeat the devil instead of just being God and saying you know do away with you then to just say I think I'm just gonna take a bunch of people that's the devil that the devil don't think nothing of yeah it's kind of like the Sampson thing you know I'm gonna tell I'm not gonna take Samson Samson is not gonna be 64 and 320 and benchpress a thousand pounds know he's gonna weigh about 90 pounds he's gonna look like somebody's accountant or is he near counting us in here that's okay look looks like somebody's accountant they set behind the desk all day in the middle of Atlanta hallelujah and he's going to destroy the world with us guy amen what better way to do that but no man tanks though that Samson was just great big you know Arnold Schwarzenegger looking thing why were they looking for its power of heat they knew where his power come from if you look like that but if you look like a little shrimp guy trust the same way it is with God he's going to take a group of people that doesn't look like to have any power at all and he's gonna live through them and work through him and destroy the devil through a ma'am and that's you done all right because watch we read this the other Sunday in Ezekiel let's go on down a little bit further remember let's remember the four things that we're doing now not to get too far ahead and remember number one death has to be destroyed number two a restoration of all things takes place a resurrection has to take place all right it's got to happen and then a rapture takes place on this fourth seal but the rapture remember the rapture is two what is rapture rapture means ecstasy it means being taken up into a different level right so that's what's going to happen because look I promise you if that's been destroyed in you if you've been restored back to where you can stand on the earth and you can control things like Adam did and you see the dead people come out of the ground and walk in among you don't you think what kind of ecstasy we're gonna have what kind of a caught thing we're just going to be caught soaked up into that so we're just going to be pulled over into another dimension we're just going to be pulled over into another dimension and let them destroy this side on this dimension then we're just going to step right back in this dimension amen so that's why it to me that I'm not looking for a rapture not anymore I'm not looking for a rapture the rapture will come but it will not come before these other three things happen amen so I'm looking for them first I'm trying to get away to where we can see that first and then the rapture will take place I promise you it'll have to take place they'll have to be a catching away but we were talking this morning June and I'm coming up the road we were watching them listening on a nominal Christian radio station and they only know what they know but they were like you know when the dead breaks out of the ground and when the trumpet sounds the Dave Lord's gonna come that's all they know they don't know that the trumps already sounded we've got that we are the recipients of that Christ has already come and the resurrection they're looking for is the same one Martha was looking for they know there's going to be a resurrection but they don't know about this resurrection this one is secret there won't be graves popped open no no that glorified body will come right out of there they'll walk through man what a power what a power that they were planted in corruption but they'll be raised in incorruption and they're not going back down again either we've seen people raised from the dead with their own very eyes but one day they're gonna put that man back in the ground as Tom Terry's but not when you see this Jen this resurrection this resurrection not the general resurrection that's what Martha was all about a general resurrection that's why all the all the believers in the world are teaching is oh there's gonna come a resurrection we're gonna see Christ I talked to a guy one time and that's all he could see was that he said well I'll be glad when I can look up in the sky and see the clouds you know the Bible said the clouds will break and Christ will come walking that's not the one you want to see that's still general that's when Christ comes to fight with for the Jews that's not when are you coming to get you and me you've already missed the resurrection you're supposed to if you see that one so see you unit but see how he understands that brother Dale said they've been taught wrong that can't restore there's no restoration in that that's just really putting it off for somebody else to do well I can do it but I know somebody no this is it this is it I will restore santé Lord and if the Lord's here then unit and you and I are part of that restoration right so death has to be destroyed or restoration of all things take place the resurrection has to take place and the rapture takes place on this fourth seal we're mover talking about spiritual death and spiritual death listen when brother Dale was talking about the church ages the spiritual death went and I see you which would be 6 in the 600's between 600 and 1500 when Martin Luther came in that was a long time that was almost 1500 years that it took for Satan listen for Satan to eat the word down with his dogmas and creeds and ideas amen then Martin Luther comes out preaching the just shall live by faith the two-shoes all right but it took that whole length of time for the corn of wheat to go in the ground and die but it didn't abide alone I mean you can't kill God he's always there I'd rather have one speck of God I'd rather have one cell of God than to have anything cell in the whole wide world just one cell so that one part of God live and don't get me wrong that fourth church age when all they did was live day by day to die that's right they lived the murders they live day by day to die because there were Christians they're just as much born-again believers as you and I sitting here today amen they just didn't have all the word to work with the word they had to work with was what they was told and what they read in whatever scripture there was at the time right but see you and I to restore all things then see we had to come to a place to where we had to have number one we had to have the word in our availability it had to be where we could get to it and then more important than ever there had to be a prophet come and be a word prophet and Elijah to restore all things according to what the Bible said jesus said surely Elijah will come and restore all things when I know other lives I did that except that one Elijah one never restored all things number two never restored all things number three introduced the Messiah that's all his job was okay amen but that fourth Elijah was the one to come in the last Church age and he was the one to come in our time and to not only bring us to the faith of the fathers but to bring us to Revelation that had been lost down through time because like real Adele said this morning that headstone was gone the top of the pyramid was flat amen but the headship which is the seven sealed to me it's the headship of this God's bending the headship of your heart since today of Pentecost amen I'll read it here in just a minute God's been the headship of the soul of man since since the 120 in the upper room right but see when the Son of man was here and when he said all power and heaven are given unto me he wasn't just God in his soul he wasn't just gone in his spirit he was gone in his flesh hey man that's what we want we got God in flesh here what's to stop us what's to stop us nothing now let's go and read let's just get that for me I don't wanna get too muddled up in some of the stuff I've been but I was gonna read the one where brother and let's talk about the the womb of the mine but yarder you ought to know that the woman your mind is where you lose it first man you lose it in the womb of your mind first all right you Satan gets in the womb of your mind and brother BAM says the only way we can ever be born again first and the womb of your mind receive the word then the Spirit comes on top of that it brings it to life there you are that's what it does so that's pretty simple how the new birth happens I was telling them this morning downstairs if you ever thought about this just give you it this is a little extra tidbit have you ever thought about this why didn't Matt why did the Holy Ghost come to Mary remember the angel come and said you will be what overshadowed by the Holy Ghost right and there will be conceived in your womb a child why didn't he say the father come it's all there the same person I know that but they have different operations they have different operations why did the Holy Ghost come and overshadow Mary why did Gabriel specifically say the whole ghosts will overshadow you and you'll bring forth the child very specific because that's what births you I you may not think anything about that but I bout had a running fit when I when I saw that that's what bursts you so it had to be the Holy Ghost overshadow Mary because what was formed in her was what the son of man but it was gone in human flesh same way with you the Holy Ghost overshadowed you one day and brought forth a child a baby at faith that's why we can be heirs and joint heirs with Christ whatever he gets is what we get he got birthed by the Holy Ghost guess what we get birthed by the Holy Ghost amen you and I have come to a place now to where all these ant questions are you wonder you and I did wonder because cousin even brother branham uses that analogy many times when he talks about you know the the Trinity because they said remember when Jesus grew up he said I came for my father then he'll go back to that verse that says Gabriel said the Holy Ghost over shouting and we know it's the same person but why didn't they say the father because the father's not that's not what bursts you own earth the Holy Ghost is what bursts you own earth amen so that's what birth Jesus that way we can be heirs and joint heirs with that man called Jesus whatever he got that's what we get now we were trapped and birthed the wrong way the first time we know that I hope that's plain but the second birth comes from the Holy Ghost burning out the old man in yot soul amen and then he comes running and then we cry Abba Father then we cry Romans 8 we go daddy daddy we need something you didn't cry for your daddy daddy when you was not born again oh yeah sure right at the time when you did but you went out there drinking a beer going well wonder what daddy God is doing today now you were talking daddy devils who you were talking to you were talking to your first day no birds birds was talking not your second bird that second birth took care a lot of those things amen I said a lot but not all because of this thank God for that too you know that explains a lot that helps you it ought to help you and your life knowing that some of the things that we do that are wrong we say are we born again see remember that's what sister Shepherd had a problem with brother Branham I the way you teach it yeah God said well I'll just give you a dream sister and I'll have a prophet here they'll tell you what it says and I'll give you the very man that is in that vision I'll give you the very man to tell you that you're okay that's what brother Branham said told her she was fine right that was her problem she was worried about things but when you put these things in order put the statue of a perfect man in now let me ask you a question that statue of a perfect man it's not fard the father he's perfect statue of a perfect man that man is you he shall know it's Jesus come on people we know that but he's already perfected he's trying to get you perfected he's trying to get me and you perfected amen that's the whole thing because truly you see that in other teachings or maybe even denominations well I'm perfect because Jesus is perfect I'm this but now I ain't perfect ain't nobody perfect you ain't perfect I ain't perfect ain't nobody perfect I hear that all the time well Christ my daddy said I was and if I go through the same channels he did it'll be all right he gave us the prescription and all we got to do is follow it I told him this morning I said everything we need for our body change for all these things that we're talking about we're not have to go to some mystery book to find it it's already in the Bible amen and we've already had temporary body changes we've already had people travel to time we've already had these things even in the Old Testament listen wherever anus is right now his body is different than what it was on the earth or he couldn't go to another in another dimension because flesh can't travel through dimensions it has to stay here Jesus didn't travel through dimensions until he got a body change amen so wherever it is that he got a body change comes remember he's our example whatever that is whatever you want to say he's something we're not in this dimension Philip Philip got transported Philip got transported from somewhere right on a cross the three Hebrew children got put in the furnace so hard it killed the people to put them in it and when they came out their clothes didn't even smell so they got a body changing their body and what the hell out so what I'm saying is we think oK we've been giving all this and now that body changes where he like on Mount Everest somewhere that we got to navigate it's already been navigated for us we just got to follow the plan but remember that was temporary this is not that was temporary with the three Hebrew children because they're laying somewhere dead in the grave but we won't because they weren't fully restored why did Izzy Keo tell us prophesy on a man and say to the wind thus that the Lord God come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon those slain that they may live and once the four things the four things were not given they were not parts given to an angel we're gonna cover something in a few minutes about that to hold that point remember Satan it's not a human Satan is an angel Satan's an angel he's not a human being he's an angel brother branham covers that up but I didn't breathe but Satan it's an angel he's a created being he was an angel but why didn't he kill talk about bones and sinew and meat and skin and breath because it's going to happen in bones and sinew in meat and in flesh and if I was preaching this somewhere else people would be shouting and they will be running the aisles but that's okay I know how y'all are it's gonna happen that way Ezekiel said it was going to happen that whoa that way listen so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel now they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost and we are cut off is that what we're standing today no therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the Lord God they go behold O my people I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves all my people and brought you up out of your graves and shall put myself and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land that you shall know that I the Lord spoken it and performed it staff the Lord now look the next thing well let's skip that skip the next go to the next quote I'm trying to build something up here just for a second remember we read in the restoration of the bride tree for death messengers killed it so forth life the messengers for life messengers has to bring it back now those life messengers are connected to what the Holy Ghost which is connected to thank you you can say you if you can see me if you want to but they connected to if you have the Holy Ghost today you have those four messengers working in you not working in an angel not working in this one are they working in you amen and if four messages of death killed the tree four messengers of life force toward the tree well where are those four messengers they're in the bride they're only in the bride they're nowhere else in the world but in the bride he's going to restore it so how's it going to restore by the four messengers in you because look even the four messengers of life brother Branham calls Martin Luther a human John Wesley a human the Pentecostal movement was begun by a man a human and then we had a human coming the end time the Elijah number four - what restore all things what was the fourth the word now I'll tell you this it was not just the word the word been there it was the Word made flesh it was a flesh word that stood at that was the problem the problem was is we had people reading this book without the oligo without the four messengers and then and that's the problem my brother Nell said false preachers bring false birth and that's what we see we see that manifesting now how people for 40 years preach this message I always thought man how does somebody preach 40 years in a congregation he has buried him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ under the message of William Branham he's married him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ under the message to William Branham he has brought him to the altar got born again under the messages of last hour and he's standing up their false prophet the whole time because remember he didn't get born again and then loses borning in experience and then deny the message no they wasn't something inside there to begin with amen so see that's the paradox that how God can use somebody to get you born again and they not even be born again think of my brother Ernie Villanueva about how the man that brought him to the Lord well you know you had to smoke that smoke a little pot had to take a little cannabis off to get anointed but brother only came in underneath that gifts and callings or without repentance there's your proof right there all these gifts you have all the gifts you want to it's like we were talking about this morning and I want you to see this because God works in human flesh but when Jesus was here on the earth and don't get me wrong I told him I said this is all over the internet so that's okay but I just don't approve of these prayer lines are fine but brother Brown never had never had a prayer line where people jump into screaming and throwing them down and pulling their hair and stomping them jesus never raised his voice brother Branham never raised his voice he was so under control supreme power in control so that in this screaming and jumping and shouting and trying to get people built up just tomorrow you know what they're back in the same place they were right set them down and teach them and that's okay if you want to scream and shout that's alright with me but what are you screaming shouting about because remember Jesus never had to scream at the devil if you have to scream at the devil you better be careful you may be like the seven sons of sceva Jesus we know Paul we know but we don't know you and you're doing something you're not supposed to be doing so we're just gonna teach you a lesson so they just yep and that's okay but that's what I'm telling you emotion is fine and getting that's okay we have to have certain things but to be fully to where we have to have a prayer line and you have to be throwing and spitting and throwing them on the ground and I've seen it you've seen it you don't need that you do not need that I'd rather have somebody stand up and look at me and say look the Lord and he'll tell him exactly what's going on like brother branham you know he he never shouted at nobody he was so in control that's the way I want it to be I like to shout about my salvation I like to cry about my salvation but you don't have to do that to get people healed hard to get people to the Oh you don't have to do that because remember God is revealed in human flesh but the devil can anoint your human flesh that's why that we've this that's why the full restoration has to come to where it's God restoring your flesh when God restores your flesh that's why would Jesus same way with him he said all power in heaven there's been getting unto me what that was God that was flesh that was all God but when he was walking and when Satan would come to him that was a human mortal man that Satan was talking to he was so hid cuz how could badi say if you be remember Satan said if you be the Son of God he oughta known he was but there was something different cuz you know what Satan was looking at he was looking at flesh just like he lives at you how in the world how in the world can that be a son of God I'm done okay that's okay how'd it work I'm kin that man son of God cuz I got a laundry list of things he did wrong last week Satan was right there going I went that one that one that one that one right so what's what we're moving to in restoration we're moving to what forget that that's not even so remember if Satan says anything he's a liar so whatever he comes and tells you he's lying but when our flesh is turned into the glorified condition Satan has no whole I brother Dale said when we leave this earth in a body changed in a rapture we can say we are truly born again cuz up until the change this comes from my mom and my daddy and it's dead this this part you see but the Bible I thought told us we were sitting in heavenly places now is it light or a we lying the Bible's not lying we might have a little problem though if we don't start seeing it that way amen but he's supposed to let's skip a few things to go down to number two proving his words talking about Luke seventeen thirty I'm going to hit the son of man just for a second but I want you to see something here right at the end we'll skip through a little bit a little bit of this everybody all right say man now after nineteen hundred years with the church age pass and all the things that prophesied of Luther and Wesley this is 1964 this is after the seal we just went through and seen it draw it out and the moon came down and drawed it out the Lord draw it on the board here and showed it come down and confirmed it after nineteen hundred years and we're at the layout of Stan Church aid he prophesied in Luke 17 30th at this same not a different this same a man would be revealed in the days like it was inside them upon the earth did you get it does it have to come to pass it's impossible now you understand that's not he's meaning it's impossible it's impossible for it not to come to pass now remember he come in three names the son of man a prophet the son of God the spirit the son of David for the Millennium but in between this conjunct conjunction now according to his own words in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed revealed himself as what not son of God we should have son of God some God should be just so clear to us that is the Holy Ghost that is that is God in spirit form but this son of man something we can see because remember we don't see the Son of God as then no man has seen God at any time but we see the son of man who declares who he is so what's the different you say well that's Jesus now that's you that's you that's the Son of God working through human flesh reveal himself as what not son of God son of man will reveal himself in a different way now if we believe what the Prophet said it must be a different way than we've seen it ever before I'm just telling you what he said let me read that one more time the son of man shall be revealed reveal himself as what not son of God son of man will reveal him his self in a different way everybody alright with that I'm just reading what the Prophet said in a different way so it's not going to be something that's the the norm that okay now let's read the next one number three in the very day that the Son of Man is revealed revelations 10 one two seven reading when you get home the seventh angels message what is it opening up the seals now see he didn't go to luke 1730 on this one and he didn't go to Malachi for he went to revelations 10 that's when the seals are to be revealed this seals is the son of man okay I mean just for illustration purposes what birthed you the son of God birthed you amen to the Church ages it was the son of God I just read that where is the son of man right here the son of man was the head walk it on the earth God in human flesh could it be God in your flesh revelations 10 one two seven reading when you get home the seventh angels message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man the brother branham was not the son of man we know that but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now and I'll promise you they did not at first and still don't know brother Branham was not God listen brother Branham don't have to come back to bring us something that ain't already brought us okay I'm resting on that because remember I told you last Sunday he who prophesized must die brother Branham prophesied of a group of people to come sure he saw a part of it but remember he didn't see it all because he told him on the sixth seal or on the questions and answers he said you're not getting it it's not for you it's gone from you and there's no way you can get it what did he see he saw that spirit lift off of those people and go to a future group what are we looking at a future group are we looking at the reality of it are we are we looking at a vision are we in the vision a man are we looking at something are we in it brother basical was two hours in a vision before he realized he was making that vision come to pass because remember a vision if it's from God has to come to pass a vision from God now I tell my visions from meeting by a vision from God has to come to pass that's why brother Branham could depend on that's why Jesus could depend on visions brother Branham said Jesus saw Lazarus raised four days before he raved now what kind of confidence is that that's a lot of confidence when you can say I was telling them downstairs when you can know exactly what's going to happen tomorrow by a vision tonight and you know what's gonna happen tomorrow where's the fear at there's no fear you know what we're looking at our problem is we're looking at the Bible as a vision we're looking at the prophets message the division not a reality because God remember God's what his thoughts become expressed his thoughts become Express the vision is now what we're walking in because if not then we're prophesying we're speaking of something to come we can't do that we can't think this mountain is so high we always tell them this morning you know the Bible says doesn't say thus saith the Lord if you speak to this mountain it says you you speak to this mountain and not doubt in your heart see that's our problem we've made this thing a mountain we've made it a mountain that we can't get over until we you know that's the problem I'm just gonna say it that's the problem I have with people that think brother Browns got to come back they're just pure lazy they have no revelation they are pure lazy people because you know what they're doing they're throwing it well I'm just gonna sit here until he gets back and then he'll tell us hogwash that's the lie the devil because you know what the devil wants you to do he wants you to believe that I want the son of man here these son of man he called it the son of man and when these son demands here they can't be another man here not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated down that's where it seems to be so hard for you see he was picking up their thought not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the Son of Man because it's left the shuk he can or you can't organize the son of man now they have organized part of the Son of God cuz in the denominations that was the Holy Ghost come okay but was but God winked at their ignorance because it was not a full restoration going on but now with the full restoration if it's the grain you can't go backwards you can't put the grain back in the husk back in the stock back in the it's all dead it's all dead the grain is all that's left and that's me in you my screaming at you you okay alright get you some get you some earplugs my brother Larry's got over I'm just glad you don't wear them kind of looks like your muffs that'd be a little and that's okay from if he hears hurt that's no problem I know I talk loud but that's another thing we were talking about this morning they you know God's not deaf you don't have to scream to God you don't he deaf just talk to him what did Jesus tell them he said he said beware of the ones that stand in the street corner and declare didn't tell everybody who they are what they're doing he said he will not you know What did he say he said those that are that way will get their reward but the ones that do it in a quiet place God God will come and reward them that's kind of paraphrasing but to me that's what I believe he'll I know if yeah if you pray in secret he'll honor you in the public you don't want an argument public now no you don't want go the other way that all right so we can't organize it you can't denominator tell us the grain and what is the grain the grain is me and you where's the grain we're the wheat we're not the plant were the seed that all right we've went through the plant we went through all these stages this is the last stage it can't go back in the ground mm-hmm all right let's go number four it was the rising of the Sun we read this last Sunday we'll read it again cuz I want to get to something right here in just a second he was waved at the day of Pentecost when there cometh sound from heaven like a waving mighty rush you in and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessings to come and to be waved again we realize in the last day now not to be waved again Pentecost 1906 that's not what he said Luke 1730 is not 1906 Azusa Street Pentecost hello he seems to be waved according to Luke 1730 because the son of man didn't come back on the day of Pentecost in 1906 Azusa Street that was the Son of God that was the Holy Ghost falling on the people giving them what giving them the gifts giving them the higher we read it and I think we may read it in this again no we read it before with Lutheran Westland penticoff it was a higher form of what God was doing you know I've always thought about this tuna you know if God would have went from Luther to Wesley to brother branham they nobody would ever accepted him but it went Luther Wesley Pentecost brother Brahms slid in with those Pentecostal people and then he was accepted because remember the Lutheran's didn't accept him in the Methodists didn't accept him but the Pentecost was accept him so they give him a little platform see God's all knowing he knew what we would do he knew we'd reject him if he just come right out of a Lutheran Church but he come in with the Pentecostal people the gifts and the signs and the wonders but remember that was just debate that wasn't the son of man that was the son of God working healing the people doing those things but in the day when the Son of Man is to be waved over the people in the Sun in the Sun day again and the day that the Esso end of man will be revealed or waved again over the people now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God let's read this again in the beginning was the Genesis 1:26 man and in Genesis when 26 man was with God and the Genesis 1:26 man was God and in Genesis 1:26 man was made flesh and dwelt among us that's why I love Genesis 1 you can put Genesis 1:26 all through the Bible it's God Almighty doing his work cuz remember that Genesis 1:26 men didn't fall man fell in flesh didn't fall in Genesis 1:26 men that Genesis 1:26 man can't fall that's Almighty God but that Almighty God was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have in confirmation of the word of God by word of god by signs by wonders that was confirming his message alright that we just who was at least eastwood up by wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke here that as we just quoted from the or the Luke 17 and the 30th verse and Malachi 4 in the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right among us and giving us life as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although topped in many places he was the first fruit of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church because we're not a church where the bride there has to be a sheaf waved again in the last days oh my waving of the sheaf what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that prove it was a week that proved it was a sheath hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about I hope you see what I'm talking about because we're under let me see if we say this without that sheath wave was important because it was the first thing if you don't understand I explain it like Sunday I was planning in the priest walked out into your field looked across the entire field and usually it was barley or wheat or corn in that day and he would see a group are a few stalks that was higher than the others that because I'll wait you know your whole field up mature at the same time even in the natural you know even in the spiritual your whole field don't mature at the same time but there is the first fruits that have come out and shown the fruit or the wheat or whatever you want to call it barley so the priest would go out there and cut those stalks off the highest of the first one to come to maturity he cuts they didn't cut the whole field down the whole field wasn't ready alright the whole field if he cut the whole field down he runs it but he only cut down what was mature he took that step back and he waved it over the whole field showing that something had come to maturity but that this whole field now the whole field the whole whatever million acres thousand acres or five acres that now that what will happen is they will accept that whole field because it's going to come to maturity just like these day if these come to maturity and it's the same kind of plans everybody listen to what I'm saying and it's the same kind of plan it will come to maturity so Christ was waved over the people he's the first one to come to maturity okay brother branham being the high priest not the chief wave hello you can't wave william branham over the people its Christ waved over the people by the priests saying that hey these are coming that all right hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about I hope you do it was waved over what the people the people the human flesh people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age that's Yoona for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being wave not a person being waved over the people the full mature word is waved over the people by the same signs and the same wonders that he be did by them because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest now and as I say it is to be waved again what the word the words to be wave now and as I say it's to be waved again in the last days everybody all right with that same am now let's get back to our little box we were talking about let's go to number 6 remember we all got a box we all got a box to work in Luther Lucis got loots her brother Brown said Luther had up he couldn't do nothing else but what was in that box I've read you that quote for like six weeks so I ain't gonna read it again but brother Brown said they have something to work in and that's all they got to work in that's all they can work in so we have a box and then we have a box to work in what is our box so that's weighted again today God is calling his elected people and they are elected now and now they are elected for what he didn't say a rapture he didn't say a body change German chocolate cake now they are elected for what for a resurrection and what kind of sign is he showing them resurrection sign what was he showing them then a delivering sign that he's talking about Moses to deliver them from the bondage the sign a power that could shut to heavens or could black the skies and now now I didn't read little that I should and now he's showing the power of the resurrection of his son living among them to resurrect them from this grave and graveyard that we're in now brother Brown went in the grave at that time so he's talking about something spiritual spiritual graveyard right to resurrect them from this grave and graveyard that we're in to the land that he promised this resurrection sign calling out a spiritual egypt and spiritual Babylon what are we elected for anybody ever say this is worthy legs and ask you ask people in the message say if you're the elect what do you like it for 99 percent of the people will look at you just like some of you look at them read them that quote you're you are elected for a resurrection let's go to the next one super sign 1963 we've had all these other things the paths of abraham's royal seed has come up that same path that abraham come up now what remember who do you meet he met God in human flesh he melt Melchizedek alright but just before the destroying of the world the super sign must appear again an eternal everlasting resurrection sign now once stop right there a lot of people under brother branham's ministry receives a temporary resurrection not an eternal one in their body in their body not in their soul I'm talking about the body because here what is he talking about just before the story in the world the super sign must appear again an eternal everlasting resurrection sign so this is not temporary this is an eternal I like that word an eternal everlasting resurrection sign that proves that the royal seed could not be killed come on people could not be killed like Daniel and like the rest of the prophets was the grave couldn't hold him because what the others listen I love this he could be the only one who can say it this way the others conquered the gates of the enemies such as fire three Hebrew children line Daniel and sword down through the ages and so forth they conquered that you won't help me read the rest of that but this royal scene you show that was Jesus all right Romans 8 said we're hairs and joint-heirs or whatever he gets we get all right here we go but this royal seed conquered death hell and the grave nothing could hold him why he's an everlasting super son what is a super sign the resurrection of Jesus Christ look after being dead for 2,000 years he was not talking about the resurrection 2,000 years ago he's talking about what a resurrection this is after being dead for 2,000 years remember Christ has come down off the mountain and he said tell the vision of no man till the Son of man be what risen again that's what he's talking about right there he's actually telling you the scripture in Matthew right here the resurrection of Jesus Christ after being dead for 2,000 years still stands in the midst of us the same as he did then manifesting myself in his Church in human flesh he's the same yesterday today and forever now you say well brother wait now that's good all that swelling good but but what are we looking for let's go to the next one conflict between God and Satan roll on down to 26 then on the day of Pentecost now this is back in Pentecost of 80 30 then on the day of Pentecost he sent back the earnest of this place let's read this he sent back the earnest not for restoration he sent back the earnest of this place now that place is capitalized so he must be talking about a place that to me is different than just saying this place the assurance the evidence that this land and they capitalized the Ale this land is real just like Joshua brought back the evidence Jesus brought the evidence of the Holy Ghost now we reckon ourselves dead turns up cake for those of you have not been here German chocolate cakes my favorite so when you start going to sleep I'll say Germans aggragate and everybody was up the wall I want some give me a piece now we reckon ourself dead we're buried with him in Baptism unto his death and we raised with him now watch we raised with him , in the resurrection you say oh that's great that's have no problem he's not finished he's not finished and now we are in already not we're going to where we're already raised oh my where now not will be we are now not sitting in heavenly places how in Christ Jesus not we will be some other time we are now the church don't realize who they are see we are now right this minute how in Christ assemble together in him already raised from the dead our soul was immortal you're sitting here today with the baptism of Holy Ghost your soul is immortal can't die never weld I never did died and ever did anything wrong can't be judged never will be judged amen all right thereby okay with that now let's talk just for a minute I'm gonna set this up for next Sunday just for a few minutes let's go to first Corinthians 6 now let's go back to my analogy of Jesus when he came out of the grave he said all power and heaven earth been given unto me in other words I'm going to transfer that power to my bride cuz I'm not gonna destroy the devil in me one person that would be too easy I'm gonna let a group for people struggling strain and and and make it just glorious amen and remember what I said about the devil the devil it's not a human the devil is an angel thereby okay without the devil is an angel he's not a human dare any of you having a matter against another go to the law before the unjust and not before the Saints in other words if you have a problem with Joe Blow out there hitting you in the car yeah if you need to take him to court but if we got a problem in this church it needs to be settled in the church and there is a scripture that says take it to the least don't take it to the pastor it says take it to the least among you to be judged don't you take a brother of the court you do you use just not right it never has been never will be do you not know that the Saints now who's the saint everybody's born again is the same do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how many times have you read that many times right have you ever thought about that angel being the devil because listen if God's gonna throw him in the lake of fire why didn't he just do it when he came out of the grave there was no judge sure he's the supreme judge but he's judging he can't break his krypter he has to judge for you know you not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life amen we shall judge angels listen to this let me I found this in Daniel you know let's read this they don't have it but Daniel 722 talking about the Ancient of Days it's not gonna be on the screen because they don't have it the Bible says in 722 of Daniel says until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given to the Saints of the Most High and the time came that the Saints possessed the kingdom Ancient of Days come and judgment was given to the Saints of the Most High that's why God that's why Jesus Christ couldn't destroy the devil could that scripture right there if we even judge angels and Satan as an angel oh my look at what we got here we come to a place to where we say well we're nothing sure we're nothing but but Jesus Christ give it all to us he's given to us and he wants us to do it in this dimension it would be real easy to do in heaven all the glory and the bliss and huh no do it down here right in Satan's Eden right in his own palace oh he can't remember the old analogy you know Satan came into God's Eden and messed up God's program we didn't mess up his program he fulfilled it but now what God has sent us right into Satan's Eden to bring us back out and take us into Eden again all right let's read right here that was one man that knew about death and life and the whole Bible his name was Joe it's all this all this body change stuff is really new all right let's read job 14 and then we'll be done but man dies and wasteth away yeah man giveth up the ghost and where is he as the waters failed from the sea and the flood to chaos and dry thought so man lies down and rises not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep now that's what jokes all remember that's what he saw he sees people die and he never saw him come back because remember the analogy is he sees the tree every winter come back died come back Diane come back he said man dies don't come back but watch all that thou would us hide me in the grave that thou would us keep me secret until thy wrath be passed you know I was thinking we ought to get friend of ours died Terence and now we're acquainted with him and he passed away at 57 years old but but I believe I know Terence believes - he's but he was well this is the quote I'll tell you the quote that demands at the funeral home the man come up to Terrance and said Johnny really thought a lot of you that I really tried to get him not to but but that's just the way they are but now people like that's good to us I believe God won't forget that you said it was sad that he died was it he just got hid he just got preserved in head till the day of judgement all that that would has keep me secret until thy wrath think of all the all the heartaches then he skipped past God's put him over into place I believe a piece just the wait hang on even for the thousand years cuz they're not gonna come up until this they got the new birthright but people's been good to you you see them die you still wants the same no it's not no it's not God's hiding them until the wrath be passed that that wood has appointed me a set time and remember me if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come he knew he couldn't meet God in the way he was if he died thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou won't have a desire to the work of thy hands for now thou numbers my steps just thou not watch over my sin what's this my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou so it's up mine iniquity throw it in to see if forgetfulness let's put another scripture in there throw it to see if forgetfulness never to be remembered again you know where that bag went it went back to the old bags they give it to you cause the devil little dirtbag little devil bag job 19 we're not finished yet we'll read these then we'll be done why do you persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh all that my words were now written all that they were printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever for I know that my Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day that's now that's now that scriptures not prophesying anymore brother John that's a reality cuz Christ the Redeemer is standing here today that he shall stand in - at the latter day upon the earth not in another dimension not in heaven but on earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God that was a prophecy if you have the Holy Ghost today it's a reality cuz in my flesh I shall see God whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another because you see him in your revelation job we'll see him in his revelation Abraham we'll see him in his revelation you and I will see him in his fullness whom I mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me job knew he was gonna have to die but he knew that he had a promise and that that Redeemer will be standing on the earth in the latter day - call alright let's read one more job 33 this is the promise of your body change this is the prophecy of your body change now let's look watch job yay his soul draws near into the grave in his life - the destroyers in other words if somebody doesn't come we got a problem if there be a messenger a seventh angel messenger an interpreter one among a thousand to show unto him his uprightness then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit not deliver him from the pit deliver him from going down to the pit I have found a ransom and that word is translated a redeemer our Anna toner our the atonement if you look in your Scofield Bible in the middle of it it will tell you his flesh shall be fresher than a child he shall return to the days of his youth you believe that that's not a prophecy anymore that's come come a reality it couldn't happen in job's day but all these things there's a messenger come an interpreter to show unto man his uprightness brother Branham came to tell us who we are and what we're doing here and where we're going and then what delivered us the message he delivered to us it's keeping us from going down to the pit his flesh shall be fresher than a child he shall return to the days of his youth I don't just make you feel good now some of you that are young it probably doesn't but some of us that are getting older it's a hallelujah time everybody stand on your feet and you know what folks it's not a fairy tale this is a reality it will happen I don't care if I have to go by the grave you have to go by the grave somebody's gonna stand here and say that is me not somebody coming job was speaking of a group of people in the latter day there's no hope folks without Christ but there's really no hope without Christ bringing this message to show us who we are and then we live it out there's no way there's no way for us to get it without a messenger coming without brother Branham coming to bring the message but who did he introduce he didn't introduce William Branham he introduced Christ lady son of man these son of man is going to change our body a son of man cannot change our body but the son of man will change our body it will happen I promise you it'll happen I don't have to promise you I can tell you it's gonna happen so the Bible said it would amen so next Sunday we'll talk about the Son of Man and what he did but remember job's already told us about our body change job the oldest why did it have to be the oldest book of the Bible so that means that's the oldest book in the Bible the oldest written part of the Bible tells us we're gonna take about a change the oldest book he'll tell us cuz Jobe must have came way before all them other ones did remember that it is the oldest book of the Bible right why did he give us that promise in the oldest book of the Bible because it was fresh to job but job was talking of a latter time see they knew you look in the Bible how many times they talk about the end time the latter day and all the end and all the latter and all that's us that's us they spoke about this right here and not another they spoke about us and he's speaking to us let's sing a song 335 ok 335 my victory is mine victory today I told Satan to get behind victory happiness more happiness is my happiness I say to get me behind happiness [Music] Pease is my piece is my piece today is why I told Slater to get e behind coffees today is my joy is my joy is my life you seem to be above door for me for the world I told Satan to get thee behind go joy today is my life think about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is mine the Holy Ghost is mine the Holy Ghost today is my oh I told Satan to get thee behind the Holy Ghost today is much like telling like this the message is mine this message is mine this message today's my oh I told Satan to get thee behind this message today is my victory is mine Oh victory is mine your Lord victory is mine victory today is mine oh I told later to get thee behind cost victory today is my name and were the only people that know what has been what's now and very shortly then gonna be a lot to come for us we're looking at a wall down here on these first three dimensions we got to step over sure there's way a lot of the things but the only Commission the box we have is a resurrection I read it the quote we are resurrection people the resurrection will happen in you and me and then a well come on a natural resurrection resurrection has already happened in a a natural resurrection will then have to transpire you know that pool that brother Ram is talking about I don't think we pulled hard enough yet because the message is going to pull them dead Saints hologram it will be a pull come among the people I believe and it is now where we're realizing that forget the laundry list that devil gives you crumble it up and throwing the trash we're resurrection people it's like King David King David was anointed to be king when he was a little boy he was anointed by Samuel the Prophet amen he was anointed by Samuel the Prophet as a young boy a young shepherd boy and then years later years later he meets a giant Mesa giant and it's not just that David and you know everybody's got the analogy of death and I know you've heard me before some of you than you have not I believe David was picking him five stones up and he said whatever that is standing in front of me I don't care if it's this big of Stone Mountain I don't care what it is cuz I believe now let's take it to heart I believe what my prophet said about me I believe years ago he said it now I've come to a little bit of a maturity to know who I am and what my purpose is and it's really not to kill that John everybody says oh yeah no it wasn't to kill the giant it was to be a king and nothing was gonna stand in his way didn't matter death hell whatever it was you know what but the whole purpose was he was standing there going my prophet said I was a king and I don't care what it is you can name put a name whatever you want put on it but your prophet I read you the will I read you the will and today the will says you are resurrection people that death cannot have you or hold you so whatever five Thrones you want to pick up and whatever giants you want to throw it at he believed that until he sat down on that throne he couldn't die [Music] do we believe that because if we believe that we'll be just like David we'll go through all that maturity we'll come to place where they will be a giant standing there and David a look at him like it was nothing because he hadn't been King yet but if he believed what his prophet said if we believed the Bible in Revelations 5 that says we shall be what kings and priests and we shall rule and reign on this earth nothing can stop us nothing can stop it our prophet has already annoyed us that's our anointing for the day it'll strike home and I know it is but our Commission is to get the Dead Saints out of the ground come to maturity get two dead Saints out of the ground death be destroyed listening when the saints come out of the ground death is destroyed because that's what's holding them in the ground but when death is destroyed they got to come out of the ground it's got to happen then we can say Satan my prophets already told me he anointed me a long time ago with eleven hundred sermons and he told me who I was what I was gonna be and there's nothing gonna stop me from reaching that goal you love the Lord victory is mine victory is mine victory today [Applause] go say hi to get thee behind come victory today's lesson join mine as your dismiss your is mine [Music] cuz you're in today [Music]
