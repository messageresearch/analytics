[3:34] thank you thank you for the testimonies
[3:36] and the things lord tonight we love you
[3:38] we thank you in jesus name
[3:41] amen and amen
[3:44] the lord willing i said the lord willing
[3:48] i'm going to try to get on
[3:49] predestination this coming weekend you
[3:52] know down into where
[3:53] we've been driving out
[3:55] so just remember that
[3:58] and remember also it's always
[4:00] easy while you're in a series to
[4:04] you know
[4:05] to be able to travel but when you're
[4:08] coming down to the end of it it's kind
[4:09] of
[4:10] well you don't know where you're going
[4:12] next know so
[4:15] not as it's not a lot to preach you just
[4:17] don't know what he wants you to preach
[4:18] so you have to kind of take it easy and
[4:21] kind of walks off all right romans 8
[4:24] and we know
[4:25] that all things work together for good
[4:27] to them that love god to them who are
[4:29] thee called according to his purpose
[4:31] for whom he did for no he also did
[4:34] predestinate
[4:35] to be conformed to the image of his son
[4:37] that he might be the firstborn among
[4:39] many brethren
[4:41] moreover whom he did predestinate
[4:44] them he also called and whom he called
[4:46] them he also justified
[4:48] and whom he justified
[4:50] them he also glorified
[4:52] what shall we then say to these things
[4:55] if god be for us
[4:57] who can be against us amen
[4:59] all right romans 10
[5:03] beginning reading about verse 13
[5:07] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[5:09] of the lord shall be saved
[5:11] how then shall they call upon him and
[5:13] whom they have not believed
[5:16] and how shall they believe in him whom
[5:17] they have not heard
[5:19] and how shall they hear without a
[5:21] preacher
[5:22] and how shall he preach except
[5:25] how shall they preach except they be
[5:27] sent
[5:29] as it is written how beautiful are the
[5:30] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[5:32] peace
[5:33] and bring glad tidings of things good
[5:36] things
[5:38] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[5:40] for isaiah said the lord who hath
[5:41] believed our report
[5:43] so then faith cometh by hearing
[5:46] and hearing
[5:47] by the word of god amen you may be
[5:49] seated
[5:50] if you look at the text and the thought
[5:52] how can you hear without a preacher and
[5:54] how can he preach unless he be sent and
[5:56] talks about faith cometh by hearing
[5:58] all right
[5:59] so now we're trying to get some things
[6:02] laid in order the main things i said i
[6:04] was going to
[6:05] do for a few services was
[6:08] try to
[6:10] get your mind into the thought process
[6:13] of
[6:15] of looking at
[6:18] the word of god
[6:20] as being something that we
[6:23] we should have been looking at from the
[6:25] very beginning but we know we realize
[6:27] we're human beings
[6:29] and uh i asked the question many times
[6:33] of this point
[6:36] does god have a seed
[6:39] or did he create mankind
[6:42] now we know his seed is his word
[6:45] i mean
[6:46] that's
[6:47] that's the law always we call it you
[6:49] know that's set in order
[6:52] but
[6:53] is god tangible like we are
[6:56] or
[6:58] did he create us we'd say well we know
[7:00] for sure that he created us
[7:02] but also to remember that
[7:04] him creating us would make him greater
[7:08] more tangible more
[7:10] real
[7:13] than we are
[7:14] all right because you wouldn't want that
[7:16] that would make the thing that's
[7:18] that's created greater than the thing or
[7:20] the one that created it
[7:22] and we know that's not true
[7:24] but then dealing with
[7:26] the fact of looking at
[7:28] god's word as
[7:32] his seed
[7:34] and how he creates
[7:36] all right
[7:38] now
[7:41] i'll get back to it in a minute and i
[7:43] made a point the other day a little bit
[7:44] about it
[7:48] the prophets would say thus saith the
[7:49] lord
[7:51] because that was god speaking through
[7:53] them right
[7:55] see if i said thus saith james cawley
[7:57] that means james carley told me to tell
[7:59] that
[8:00] so when when a prophet would say thus
[8:02] saith the lord
[8:04] well
[8:05] that would
[8:07] be right
[8:08] but just remember
[8:09] that jesus never said thus saith the
[8:11] lord
[8:13] because he was not using someone else to
[8:16] speak
[8:17] he was god himself
[8:19] all right
[8:20] so he didn't have to say thus saith the
[8:21] lord
[8:22] because he was that word all right now
[8:26] we get back to the end of the message
[8:27] tonight the lord willing we'll be
[8:29] dealing with that
[8:31] but we've been talking about
[8:34] what is the seed of god
[8:38] and we've
[8:41] trying to make a point out of it to
[8:42] where we can think about it
[8:46] the alive word
[8:49] the word made alive
[8:52] is the seed of god
[8:54] the letter of the page is just letters
[8:56] on a page
[8:58] you know
[8:59] if it's not quick and made alive
[9:01] then it's just words
[9:04] okay
[9:05] and the prophet said
[9:07] it could be questioned as long as it's
[9:09] laying in the bible
[9:12] but once it comes off the pages of that
[9:14] bible into your heart
[9:16] it can never be questioned
[9:18] why because it's been made alive
[9:21] all right
[9:23] in talking about
[9:25] faith or revelation
[9:28] and that it comes by as we just got to
[9:30] reading
[9:31] faith cometh by hearing
[9:34] and hearing by let me
[9:36] state it this way and not add to faith
[9:39] cometh by hearing and hearing
[9:42] by hearing the word
[9:45] by faith
[9:46] can i say it that way and that don't
[9:48] change it see
[9:50] it it means faith cometh by hearing
[9:54] and hearing by the word that's revealed
[9:58] right
[9:59] see because there'd be no need of saying
[10:01] it like that
[10:02] all right now if that's true then
[10:07] and we believe it
[10:08] then we know that
[10:11] god's word
[10:16] it can judge us
[10:19] it can condemn us
[10:22] we don't want to talk about that as
[10:23] being the word
[10:25] but it will
[10:27] but it can also set us free
[10:32] what's the difference in it
[10:35] it's whether or not we can receive it
[10:38] as coming from god
[10:40] all right
[10:42] now
[10:44] in doing that then
[10:47] see god chose
[10:51] his original plan
[10:53] was not to
[10:55] have to use man
[10:57] you know to
[10:58] speak he would just use man to
[11:02] bring forth what he wanted to
[11:05] because as i said now moses
[11:08] the prophet made it plain that
[11:11] it was first god's thought then it was
[11:13] moses thought
[11:14] and he said it's not a word yet
[11:17] all right
[11:19] but now that's not said about him when
[11:21] he was writing
[11:23] genesis exodus leviticus numbers in
[11:25] deuteronomy
[11:29] and
[11:29] moses never said thus saith the lord
[11:33] in that writing
[11:36] see if it had not been a fall we know
[11:39] that it was wrote about the fall we know
[11:41] that okay
[11:43] but had it not been a fall had there not
[11:45] been a problem we wouldn't have been in
[11:47] this condition right
[11:50] even after
[11:52] the fall
[11:55] god wanted to speak to every individual
[11:59] amen all right you agree with that
[12:01] because he did
[12:03] see
[12:04] okay
[12:06] but now when it comes as we were covered
[12:07] the other day when it comes there in
[12:09] exodus 20
[12:13] and god came down and gave the
[12:15] commandments by moses
[12:19] and because of his presence being so
[12:22] um great
[12:25] of the thunders the lightnings the
[12:27] things you know
[12:28] the people got afraid
[12:31] and they said
[12:32] uh now moses you speak with us
[12:36] because if we you're god we're going to
[12:38] die
[12:39] they got us scared right
[12:41] all right
[12:43] now
[12:44] what about mankind then
[12:46] choosing
[12:50] choosing mankind
[12:53] to bring the word now did you hear what
[12:54] i said
[12:55] i didn't say god i said mankind
[12:58] choosing the way he wanted it to come
[13:03] but then he turns around now and what
[13:06] does he say
[13:08] we don't want moses to speak no more
[13:11] we don't want brother random to speak no
[13:12] more
[13:13] we don't want you know this that or the
[13:16] other
[13:17] we want to hear from god ourself
[13:22] that's really a change isn't it
[13:25] but you know
[13:29] god will never do it that way
[13:32] because once we
[13:35] wanted
[13:37] the prophets to speak to us
[13:40] then he won't change from that right
[13:43] okay now watch that when we come through
[13:45] the old testament then we come to the
[13:46] new testament
[13:49] and he used paul which was a prophet
[13:51] right
[13:52] all right
[13:53] he's still speaking today
[13:56] amen because he spoke to us in the end
[13:57] time through
[13:59] the prophet right
[14:01] all right
[14:03] see then
[14:05] faith cometh by hearing
[14:11] now hearing comes by the word
[14:16] now think about what i'm saying and i'll
[14:18] get back to it after a while and
[14:19] emphasize more
[14:22] first it was god's thought
[14:26] and then it was
[14:28] spoken and it becomes a word
[14:31] well
[14:32] then we're trying to make it to word
[14:34] that we think that we can
[14:36] receive for ourselves
[14:39] instead of having to depend upon
[14:40] somebody
[14:42] but why does the scripture say faith
[14:44] cometh by hearing
[14:47] well now brother dale i never had never
[14:49] went to church
[14:51] i i never but you heard somebody
[14:55] you heard
[14:56] somebody you read the bible that was
[14:59] somebody speaking to you
[15:03] now what i want you to show me is
[15:04] anybody in the bible
[15:07] that ever received the holy ghost
[15:08] without hearing the word first
[15:11] like to have that you know i'd like to
[15:14] know that
[15:16] i know god can begin to work on people
[15:19] yeah
[15:21] but
[15:22] why would he begin to work on people
[15:25] you know
[15:27] or how would he begin to work
[15:29] he could speak to man
[15:32] right
[15:34] don't you believe he spoke to this
[15:35] prophet in the end
[15:37] well
[15:39] see then there's nothing wrong with the
[15:40] way that it's going
[15:42] it's just the point of trying to make
[15:44] that we
[15:48] wanted a way of it being done but then
[15:50] when god came that away
[15:54] then we turn it down
[15:56] all right
[15:57] amos 3 and 7 says what he won't do
[15:59] nothing
[16:00] except
[16:02] reveal his secrets to his prophets all
[16:04] right
[16:05] now
[16:07] we ended up
[16:09] coming over into the new testament
[16:11] there sunday
[16:14] and bringing it to the
[16:16] new testament prophet
[16:18] which would be the apostle paul because
[16:20] he wrote the biggest force in the new
[16:21] testament
[16:24] and paul reaffirms
[16:26] the fact or covers the fact of what
[16:29] we've done
[16:31] in our representation with the people
[16:33] back there when they said don't let god
[16:36] speak
[16:37] let man speak
[16:39] and paul brings it down to the scripture
[16:41] we just read
[16:43] and he says
[16:45] how shall they hear
[16:48] without a preacher
[16:51] you know there's a lot of tape churches
[16:53] today because they won't hear
[16:57] no preacher
[17:00] and they say we believe everything the
[17:01] prophet said
[17:03] and he said
[17:05] my full ministry
[17:07] was for the perfecting the saints
[17:10] paul said that
[17:12] see a scriptural lineup was made by the
[17:15] apostle paul
[17:18] in saying
[17:21] that how can we hear
[17:25] without a preacher
[17:28] all right but he didn't stop there
[17:32] he goes on in our thought of saying what
[17:37] and how shall
[17:41] he preach
[17:42] or they preach
[17:44] unless it be sent
[17:47] all right
[17:49] now then we must realize that what he's
[17:52] saying that
[17:54] some are going to go out with their own
[17:56] words
[17:58] right
[17:59] and it won't be sent
[18:02] you know
[18:07] i'm not arguing with nobody about who's
[18:08] sinner who's what i'm just talking about
[18:10] the word
[18:12] why would it be that
[18:15] he would say
[18:18] how can you hear without a preacher
[18:21] i said now you hold on just a minute
[18:24] satan's got his angels that's other
[18:26] scriptures right
[18:28] even as ministers of righteousness and
[18:30] honor
[18:32] but he puts a stipulation on that
[18:35] minister
[18:38] that says how can that minister
[18:41] preach
[18:43] unless he be sent
[18:46] so he's stating as i was trying to get
[18:48] to sunday one fact
[18:51] mama called daddy since no a preacher
[18:55] right
[18:57] i've listened to preachers talk about
[18:59] their call to the ministry and i'm not
[19:01] going to argue with nobody
[19:04] i'm just trying to state facts of what i
[19:06] believe
[19:09] paul said the mystery
[19:11] wherever he was called
[19:16] i believe every god called minister
[19:19] you notice the way i said it now
[19:21] truly
[19:22] called minister
[19:24] that is sin of god
[19:26] has something to bring to the people
[19:29] no matter what age you're in
[19:33] no matter what
[19:34] you have something to bring to the
[19:36] people
[19:38] and that's his purpose
[19:41] you know i've told you many times maybe
[19:43] mine is just to be so
[19:45] outlandishly hateful and arrogant and
[19:47] stubborn and whatever to be that
[19:52] i just seem to have
[19:53] or have been
[19:55] led to deal with contradictions
[19:58] seemingly that are in the message
[20:01] and the people of the message
[20:03] maybe that's me maybe that's just me
[20:07] it's okay
[20:08] dumb dokey tells you the truth
[20:10] you got to amend the donkey
[20:13] right
[20:15] no matter what
[20:16] you mean baylor turn around that donkey
[20:18] quit talking to me but i'm trying to
[20:20] save your life you know
[20:22] and he realized it
[20:24] but now think about it
[20:27] so we ended up speaking
[20:30] where the prophet said
[20:33] on the message things that are to be
[20:35] 1965
[20:39] that these ministers
[20:42] would sweep this on
[20:44] they would take the message sweep it on
[20:46] to the coming of the lord
[20:48] all right
[20:50] now
[20:52] then we went over to where he was
[20:53] talking about it on
[20:55] believing god in 52
[20:59] he said really what a minister has is
[21:01] just an ability
[21:03] to break the spell
[21:06] that satan has over your mind
[21:10] and he says that demon there is to cut
[21:12] you off he said the reason i wasn't
[21:14] saved quoting him what he said when i
[21:16] was 12 years old he said because there
[21:17] was a demon there
[21:21] now he was sincere don't you think so
[21:25] well now he was born a prophet okay
[21:28] praise the lord but in this dispensation
[21:32] since calvary
[21:36] to be a prophet in the
[21:38] body of christ
[21:40] is necessary first that you get into
[21:42] that body amen so then the prophet had
[21:46] to be born again
[21:48] and he tells us about his new birth
[21:51] all right
[21:52] and in doing that he doesn't say well i
[21:55] was a prophet all alone i don't have to
[21:57] get born again i come to seed in me
[22:02] that's the way the people say it now
[22:03] right
[22:05] but yet your prophet emphasized that he
[22:08] needed the new birth
[22:11] and he emphasized the scriptures that
[22:12] paul did
[22:14] that
[22:16] you can't
[22:18] hear unless you have
[22:19] the holy spirit
[22:21] to reveal the word to you
[22:24] that doesn't mean you cannot
[22:26] memorize it
[22:29] listen to it 24 hours a day
[22:33] it means it's not revealed
[22:36] until the holy spirit comes amen and
[22:39] reveals it
[22:40] all right
[22:41] and according to what christ mr god
[22:43] revealed about 45 i think it is
[22:46] he said the holy ghost is the only
[22:48] revealer of the word
[22:54] then think about it
[23:00] it's necessary that we hear
[23:04] the word amen
[23:08] i made the point there
[23:09] emphasizing that
[23:11] you know
[23:12] if you
[23:13] come into the world with this seed like
[23:15] everybody wants to make it and i believe
[23:17] what the prophet said on those quotes
[23:19] we will get back to all of that we've
[23:21] been through parts of it but
[23:27] but it's just emphasized by people that
[23:29] you don't need a new birth
[23:30] all you got to do is just believe
[23:34] well
[23:35] that's all right that's
[23:37] everybody's business
[23:39] all i'm trying to do is get you and i to
[23:41] see
[23:42] the one question i asked
[23:45] 30 something years ago
[23:48] i said is the new birth the birth of the
[23:50] word that you came here with it in you
[23:53] that you believe
[23:54] or is it the birth of the word that you
[23:56] hear after you get here
[23:58] that's all i want to know and that's all
[24:00] i want to know tonight
[24:04] because if it's what you came in the
[24:06] world with you don't need nobody
[24:10] go home stay at home
[24:13] don't even put no tapes on the brother
[24:14] adam because you don't need him
[24:20] you just need to believe you always wise
[24:24] yeah you just get brother there you just
[24:25] get you get us all stirred up because of
[24:28] your your stubbornness
[24:31] maybe you'll study a little bit
[24:33] and maybe the lord might speak to you
[24:36] all right
[24:38] but now listen
[24:42] the one point i'm trying to get across
[24:44] to
[24:44] you and was sunday
[24:47] and i want to relate just a little bit
[24:48] to it and move on
[24:51] is what is the seed of god
[24:55] we say well it's the word
[24:58] well then you can hold the word in your
[25:00] hand
[25:04] read it memorize it right
[25:09] it won't do you no good
[25:11] unless
[25:12] it's quickened right
[25:14] so it's any natural seed
[25:18] you hold it in your hand
[25:20] you keep it they preserved it six
[25:23] thousand years in the pyramids of egypt
[25:26] and they
[25:27] opened it up went got the seed put it in
[25:29] the ground
[25:31] nourishment of the ground the moisture
[25:33] produced grain
[25:35] wheat you know
[25:37] why because it was a germanized seed
[25:42] it was a seed that had life in it
[25:45] right
[25:46] now
[25:48] watching you'll understand what i'm
[25:50] trying to get at
[25:53] how can you hear without a preacher
[25:56] he said well what are you doing brother
[25:58] dale i'm just going sowing seed or are
[26:00] you sowing seed
[26:04] and i know the word of god is called a
[26:05] seed i know that
[26:07] but are you really sowing seed
[26:13] how are you doing it
[26:16] are you doing it with the letter only
[26:24] come on
[26:28] i thought
[26:31] that the only way he could preach
[26:33] was the fact that he was sent
[26:37] and if he sent
[26:40] then
[26:42] how was jesus sent
[26:45] you remember that
[26:48] how was jesus sent god came down went in
[26:51] him
[26:54] i thought a true
[26:56] minister of the gospel
[26:59] was to try to
[27:01] help you break down the word the prophet
[27:04] had brought not to try to get another
[27:06] message or be anything greater than the
[27:09] prophet
[27:10] no
[27:11] we recognize where we get it from
[27:15] and just remember the bible says
[27:17] oh you have
[27:19] you received
[27:21] all right
[27:23] see then
[27:27] wouldn't the minister then be trying to
[27:29] tell you what he sees
[27:35] when you find that out one of these days
[27:36] you'll realize
[27:39] that
[27:41] a lot of preachers all are doing is
[27:45] sowing their own seed
[27:53] they're sowing their own seed
[27:55] i'm trying my best to get you an eye
[27:58] to a change of these bodies in a rapture
[28:01] and a resurrection if we die and go by
[28:02] the grave
[28:04] that's my goal that's my doing that's
[28:06] all i've been concerned with
[28:09] all right
[28:10] we could have a big home church if we
[28:12] could have everything we could be
[28:14] you know but we sit in a building like
[28:17] this
[28:18] but we are debt-free
[28:20] and we can
[28:23] help other people
[28:25] and do things
[28:27] all right
[28:29] but you see
[28:30] if you're sin of god you've got
[28:32] something to say
[28:35] as i said about the man learned the
[28:36] bible you know
[28:38] the battle was over and this runner took
[28:40] off and
[28:43] you know he knew what to tell could have
[28:44] been told
[28:46] another man come on let me go let me go
[28:48] let me go
[28:49] he said don't send him
[28:51] no no i want to go he said well go
[28:55] well he outran the other guy right
[28:57] that's right
[28:59] but when he got to her
[29:01] now no message
[29:05] well what's the message
[29:07] i don't know
[29:10] and while here comes a man little slower
[29:12] he gets hurt
[29:15] and uh
[29:16] he tells the message
[29:18] well the prophet preached the sermon
[29:20] right
[29:21] running without a message
[29:23] all right
[29:24] so that means we can do everything and
[29:26] it look
[29:28] right
[29:29] right
[29:30] go to church
[29:32] preach
[29:34] all kinds of things happen
[29:37] and it'd still not be
[29:40] sin of god
[29:43] yeah i face that
[29:46] because what if i'm one of those that's
[29:47] running without a message
[29:51] all you got to do is a choice to find
[29:53] out whether i'm running without it or
[29:55] not
[29:56] i got to be responsible if i am or not
[29:59] all right
[30:01] but now think about it
[30:07] a natural seed we look at it
[30:10] we say we have a seed of corn
[30:14] but we can't find the life of that corn
[30:18] they can make one look just like it
[30:21] everything perfect
[30:22] except for one thing what
[30:24] no jeremy of life
[30:27] so is it then if i'm bringing what god
[30:29] says
[30:32] if a true preacher is bringing what god
[30:34] says
[30:36] tells him first
[30:39] right
[30:40] how his woman must what
[30:43] be first partakers of the fruit
[30:46] i get a message i come here
[30:48] i try my best to deliver that message to
[30:50] you
[30:51] because that's what a true minister does
[30:54] and i don't have my message
[30:58] i'm just the vessel
[31:01] that's being used
[31:03] all right
[31:04] now
[31:06] in that then
[31:08] where is the seed
[31:11] of a grain of corn
[31:14] so we got to see the corn really we
[31:16] don't even call it that right we say we
[31:18] have a grain of corn which is
[31:20] technically more rot
[31:23] what is the true meaning i just quoted
[31:25] these the other day
[31:27] what is the true meaning
[31:30] of the word seed
[31:33] i don't have to look it up i know what
[31:34] it is
[31:36] well according to the
[31:39] strong's concordance 22 33
[31:43] the word seed means offspring
[31:47] descended
[31:50] it means children
[31:55] what
[31:57] webster says
[31:59] what we're supposed to speak by right
[32:04] says the seed is the germ or propagate
[32:08] for creative or population if every how
[32:10] you say co-creative which means to
[32:13] reproduce
[32:14] source of anything
[32:17] the ability to reproduce
[32:18] it means sperm or even semen
[32:21] is the word seed
[32:23] all right
[32:25] now
[32:25] we've been over and over that it takes
[32:30] the germ and the egg to make a seed
[32:34] all right
[32:36] so now
[32:38] word and spirit
[32:40] is the seed of god
[32:44] word by itself is not
[32:48] alive
[32:51] the letter killeth
[32:53] and you can have the spirit on your
[32:55] spirit
[32:58] can still be lost
[33:01] so one without the other is no good
[33:05] now i can holler it's coming back
[33:08] see it takes the word and the spirit
[33:12] so now do you see why the preacher's
[33:13] doing
[33:15] if i preach my own ideas i'm showing
[33:19] a denominational seed that's what your
[33:21] prophet calls it
[33:26] and that can't be made alive
[33:30] only the word of god could be made alive
[33:34] right
[33:37] and the word of god then being
[33:39] germatized
[33:44] right
[33:46] germatized
[33:48] we're in a day of that aren't we where
[33:49] that we deal with germatic seed that's
[33:52] what we're talking about tonight
[33:56] and if that seed hasn't been germitized
[34:00] it won't reproduce that's right
[34:04] even a hybrid
[34:08] that can bring up just to deform things
[34:11] it still has to be
[34:13] to a degree dramatized
[34:18] and that's what we do with the word of
[34:19] god when we take our ideas
[34:21] and we put it on the word of god we
[34:23] deform that word
[34:27] and no matter how far we can go with it
[34:30] it won't produce correctly
[34:33] right
[34:35] think about how that prophet when he
[34:37] came and started preaching
[34:39] how he realized what he was doing
[34:44] how he was preaching the word of god
[34:48] it was totally contrary
[34:51] to every denomination it was
[34:55] truly he stood alone didn't he
[34:59] you know
[35:00] a handful of people believed him and
[35:03] just like jesus
[35:04] a lot of that handful
[35:07] you know
[35:08] some of them after brought a random past
[35:10] on within six months was back in
[35:12] denominationalism
[35:14] that were names he called on almost
[35:16] every tape
[35:20] but you see
[35:21] they got the letter of the word
[35:25] but they never caught on to what the man
[35:27] was doing
[35:30] he said well he was planting seed was he
[35:32] planting seed
[35:34] or were you trying to put a germ into
[35:35] the people
[35:38] we don't deal with germs seed gene
[35:40] in the correct way do we
[35:43] we did well it's all a seed brother tail
[35:47] we'll go get you some corn that somebody
[35:50] made and plant it
[35:52] right
[35:56] some way get that germ out of that grain
[35:58] of corn and go put it in the ground i
[36:00] mean the
[36:01] the grain of corn but also the germ
[36:04] won't do to put it in the ground
[36:08] it has to rot
[36:11] rotting out
[36:13] rottening out is what produces enough
[36:16] what do you call it energies or whatever
[36:19] you call it
[36:20] um
[36:23] to make the grain come alive
[36:26] well so is it with the word of god
[36:29] what if faith comes by hearing
[36:32] then somebody's got to preach it
[36:35] all right
[36:38] because that little yeller thing you're
[36:39] looking at that's not the grain of life
[36:43] you go there pull him up out of the
[36:44] ground one day and you look and it's all
[36:46] just cracked open and rotten and like
[36:48] everything and
[36:49] and your corn done up to three inches
[36:51] tall
[36:53] huh even your crows know that you watch
[36:56] them go after it
[36:58] all right
[36:58] the ability to reproduce
[37:03] is what a seed is
[37:06] all right
[37:09] then if the germ of life is not in the
[37:12] seed
[37:16] it won't reproduce
[37:19] the whole shell husk whatever you want
[37:21] to call it
[37:22] the outside of the
[37:25] grain is not what reproduces
[37:28] it's the life in the grain
[37:31] all right
[37:34] the prophet said lean not to your own
[37:35] understanding
[37:37] if it didn't have the germ of life in it
[37:41] it could never be quickened
[37:44] right
[37:46] now do you understand what then the seed
[37:48] really is
[37:51] you talk about a peach seed
[37:55] and we say it's in the heart of the
[37:56] pizza
[37:57] what are we calling
[38:01] we're talking about the ability
[38:04] to reproduce
[38:06] i remember at work down there one time a
[38:08] man boy he got on to me
[38:10] and he challenged me and i said okay
[38:12] i accept
[38:15] because he said
[38:16] let them tassels you see out there on
[38:18] that pecan tree
[38:20] this spring
[38:22] he said you plant them tassels
[38:24] and that brings up
[38:28] the pecan tree
[38:30] i said man you're crazy
[38:33] i know what i've read
[38:35] okay what you doing
[38:37] you gotta get the seed
[38:39] i tell you what i'll do i'll flap me
[38:41] some tassels or what you call
[38:44] you plant you some
[38:45] okay
[38:48] i took him a peace tree
[38:50] i mean a pecan tree
[38:52] he never brought me one
[38:55] because that tassel don't do it
[38:58] all right
[38:59] that's beautiful isn't it
[39:01] come on
[39:02] i mean see where it's hard to go with
[39:04] the thought when
[39:06] you say look at all these churches and
[39:07] how beautiful they are
[39:10] but they're only tassels
[39:13] now i have no germ of life
[39:16] and you say well no i'm not talking off
[39:17] of them i'm telling like it is
[39:22] they'll bring forth more denominations
[39:25] what do you want to call them brandon
[39:26] mice or a little odds that's no problem
[39:28] with me
[39:32] but we call the hull
[39:35] the seed
[39:37] when
[39:38] really the germ of life is the seed
[39:44] because then the letter killeth
[39:48] but the germ of life
[39:50] see the spirit
[39:51] give us life but the spirit don't have
[39:53] something to fall on
[39:56] it can't reproduce itself
[40:00] the outside of the hull will not
[40:01] reproduce
[40:03] but the germ of life will
[40:07] now watch and you'll see
[40:09] why paul said that we cannot hear
[40:12] without a preacher
[40:14] and how can he preach unless he be sent
[40:17] all right
[40:23] a scent preacher is one with a message
[40:26] you agree
[40:28] no no we're not talking about brother
[40:29] brown's message right he brought his
[40:31] message
[40:33] we're talking about the part that we're
[40:34] supposed to break it down to help
[40:36] understand what the prophet has said
[40:40] all right
[40:41] see then
[40:43] i must first get
[40:47] let's see if you can follow me and walk
[40:49] with me
[40:52] i get a thought by listening to the
[40:53] prophet's message
[40:58] all right
[41:02] and i wait for that to be quickened
[41:06] because i realize
[41:08] that if i depress too much
[41:11] i can run overboard and
[41:13] it won't work
[41:16] so i wait
[41:18] i've had things that
[41:20] i studied for 20 years before i ever
[41:22] preach them
[41:24] most preachers won't say that right
[41:28] why because
[41:30] it would not progress on in the rest of
[41:32] the word so even though it was a good
[41:35] idea or a good thought
[41:39] a thought is fine
[41:42] but remember
[41:43] the devil can give you thoughts too
[41:49] yeah but i know the difference brother
[41:51] dale the devil's mean and hateful and
[41:54] and god sweet and humble
[41:57] i've had him to tell me a few times to
[41:59] sit down and shut up
[42:01] it didn't sound too nice
[42:03] but it had a meaning to it and i done
[42:05] what he said
[42:09] see then if faith comes by hearing
[42:13] then someone must speak
[42:16] the word
[42:18] before it can be made alive
[42:21] now keep going back to this over and
[42:23] over where you won't run me off
[42:26] i'm not talking about
[42:28] trying to get
[42:29] um
[42:31] the thoughts of moses
[42:34] even though that is in it as you come
[42:36] down
[42:38] i'm talking about getting a thought from
[42:40] the message
[42:41] of the hour
[42:44] getting a thought from what the prophet
[42:45] has said
[42:50] and then looking to see whether that's
[42:52] right or not
[42:55] see
[42:59] jesus sowed
[43:02] the seed in the disciples
[43:07] now is that true amen
[43:09] about three and a half years right
[43:12] you know they understood some of the
[43:14] things he said
[43:17] right
[43:18] finally one of them said one day on
[43:20] where's peter one of them said
[43:22] you know
[43:24] we now know that you you got the words
[43:27] of life
[43:29] and one day jesus said why don't you go
[43:31] he's where can we go
[43:35] they saw certain things
[43:40] and like i was bringing out the other
[43:41] day we talk about
[43:43] we just make a seat alive we just throw
[43:46] it out anything
[43:47] a little woman at the whale
[43:50] she was looking for the messiah
[43:52] she had heard
[43:55] right
[43:58] and when he came
[44:00] that was quickened to her that that was
[44:02] who that was
[44:04] did that give her the new birth
[44:06] that's all i'm asking
[44:12] then
[44:14] if the ability to make her eternal
[44:17] was brought by her understanding that he
[44:19] was the messiah
[44:22] then what does she need calvary for
[44:26] what does she need the day of pentecost
[44:32] that's what people think
[44:34] they quote they'll say we come here with
[44:36] a seat and say look at that little woman
[44:37] at the whale
[44:39] okay
[44:42] look at her
[44:46] i don't believe she went on being a
[44:48] prostitute dude i don't believe that
[44:52] but that did not give her the new birth
[44:55] and as i said what about mary that would
[44:57] be a real good case
[44:59] but your prophet said
[45:02] mary pulled up in the upper room
[45:04] received the baptism in the holy ghost
[45:08] all right
[45:11] he said but peter
[45:13] he had a revelation of who jesus was
[45:17] right the heart the christ the son of
[45:19] the living god
[45:23] and just like mary
[45:26] who denied him being
[45:30] virgin born
[45:32] and being on god
[45:34] we find peter lying and cursing about it
[45:38] i don't know this guy
[45:43] is that what heaven's going to be
[45:51] you see no matter how much you hear the
[45:52] word preached
[45:54] which is vital
[45:57] got to be
[46:00] no matter how much it's shown
[46:05] it's got to be quickened
[46:08] if not it's dead
[46:16] if it's sown
[46:18] and does not rotten out
[46:21] the life cannot come forth
[46:25] and we was reading there the other day
[46:27] and one of the parables were that they
[46:29] took the seed and
[46:31] and it sprang up
[46:34] okay
[46:37] but the cures of life and the things
[46:40] took it away
[46:43] you'd never do any good did it
[46:48] see then the word must come through
[46:50] somebody
[46:55] and when that word comes through
[46:57] somebody
[46:59] i hope you're going to follow me down
[47:00] for the rest of this message
[47:03] it's going to come first to you
[47:06] as a thought
[47:13] and if you don't believe that thought
[47:15] if you allow satan to take that thought
[47:17] out
[47:21] then
[47:23] look what you got
[47:29] see it's got to be a thought
[47:31] before it can be a word
[47:38] right
[47:39] so then
[47:42] all i'm doing tonight is using letters
[47:45] of a wording
[47:46] to speak to you
[47:50] but god can take that and drop down into
[47:52] your heart
[47:54] and quicken to you
[47:57] not even what i'm saying
[48:00] at the point
[48:03] he might speak to you
[48:05] of something that
[48:07] i'm not even talking about
[48:11] and you say oh i say that
[48:14] well
[48:15] all i done was what the prophet said
[48:19] i broke the spell satan has over your
[48:21] eyes where god could speak to you
[48:23] because that's all i'm trying to do
[48:25] you know what i'm trying to do tonight
[48:28] i i said it sunday
[48:30] and you know i thought man
[48:32] gonna give all the calling he'll be
[48:33] nobody coming up here and a lot of
[48:34] people did
[48:35] but i made the point in the emphasis on
[48:37] one thing
[48:40] preaching the gospel is casting out
[48:42] devils
[48:44] if you want to be healed
[48:46] make sure you ain't got a devil
[48:51] that's brother dale
[48:53] you who
[48:56] that's what your prophet said
[49:01] casting out devils is casting out
[49:02] unbelief
[49:05] well i didn't realize i had it
[49:07] well that's the point
[49:10] if you realize you had it you already
[49:11] done got rid of it
[49:15] but you see i know that's what i'm doing
[49:17] and i know then that when i speak
[49:21] that the biggest portion of the people
[49:23] are taking only the letter of the word
[49:24] i'm saying
[49:27] they're not
[49:28] listening for a revelation
[49:32] they're only listening to words that i
[49:34] say
[49:35] to try to trap me into
[49:37] well you said so-and-so
[49:45] but you see
[49:49] it first must be a thought
[49:54] now
[49:56] that thought you receive
[50:02] if it's quickened
[50:04] it makes a lot of that thought right
[50:08] now you go with me
[50:10] if that thought you receive is quickened
[50:12] you know i have no problem well then
[50:14] what did you get
[50:16] you got a journey
[50:19] that's right
[50:21] the thought is adjourned
[50:25] brother brown said we wouldn't a german
[50:26] god's
[50:28] mind
[50:32] a germ
[50:34] a thought
[50:36] that's all i can do says to gail he's
[50:38] trying to speak to you
[50:40] in some way try to
[50:43] break the spell satan has over your eyes
[50:45] you can't see it and that's not nothing
[50:47] wrong with all that away
[50:50] but yet speak something that you can
[50:53] take
[50:55] and hold on to that
[50:57] and that's what them disciples had
[51:01] all they had was one thing
[51:05] where can we go
[51:09] is that what they said
[51:12] where can we go
[51:15] now that's the words of eternal life
[51:18] you're the only one with the ability to
[51:20] bring life to me was what they were
[51:22] saying right
[51:24] all right
[51:27] see then first it's a thought
[51:32] and then it becomes a word
[51:36] when you speak it
[51:39] amen
[51:39] now are we back in the scriptures
[51:42] are we over in romans where it says
[51:45] with a heart
[51:47] man believeth
[51:50] but said with the mouth
[51:54] he's speaking right
[51:57] right is that romans
[52:01] see them speaking the word
[52:04] and it's necessary to speak according to
[52:06] what he says
[52:09] if not we've got our own
[52:12] but now
[52:13] as i said i'd like to say it over and
[52:15] over
[52:16] show me any word
[52:17] in the bible
[52:19] or any word brother branham said
[52:22] that people receive the holy ghost
[52:25] without first hearing the word
[52:32] well
[52:35] yes god i'd worn this seed in me i
[52:37] didn't need nothing
[52:40] well
[52:41] go ahead
[52:44] you know argument you
[52:47] i'm just saying i didn't see it that way
[52:49] that all right
[52:52] why because i'm a firm believer in you
[52:55] must be born again
[53:00] and if you're not born again you're lost
[53:04] and die and on your way to hell
[53:07] that's as plain as i can make it
[53:11] that's where everybody wants that thing
[53:12] though yeah but
[53:14] if i'm predestinated
[53:17] i'll be there of course i'm going to
[53:19] live like the devil while i got to
[53:20] change
[53:25] he said oh that's not
[53:26] said it's not
[53:31] why did why did we go on doing what we
[53:33] was doing
[53:39] if god wants to save me bless god he can
[53:41] save me
[53:44] he can't without you first
[53:47] accepting it
[53:51] i just i just old enough i guess
[53:54] sorry you just still believe in
[53:56] justification sanctification and the
[53:58] baptism of the holy ghost
[54:02] and believing that
[54:04] you must hear
[54:06] from somebody
[54:08] whether it be a tape you put on whether
[54:11] it be the bible you pick up and read you
[54:13] are hearing what someone has said
[54:17] all right
[54:22] adjourn a seed
[54:30] would it be possible that we could
[54:33] have all the word
[54:35] in letter form come on
[54:38] and it not be quickened
[54:42] i believe it my computer has it
[54:46] don't yours
[54:48] you know
[54:50] it ain't saved
[54:53] and a lot of people can have
[54:54] photographic memories of the bible and
[54:56] things that don't save you right
[55:02] so how did the prophet explain something
[55:04] to us
[55:06] and i believe it's very vital
[55:09] and it'll explain why
[55:11] how can you hear without a preacher how
[55:13] can he preach without it unless he be
[55:14] sent
[55:16] all right go ahead brothers pull up
[55:18] number one on the notes
[55:20] this is from spoken words original seed
[55:22] reached 1962.
[55:24] we start 389 through 92 then jump over
[55:28] to four
[55:29] 300 and something all right
[55:31] but look
[55:34] now watch remember god's law of
[55:36] reproduction
[55:38] now remember after it's kind
[55:40] that's right corn against today amen
[55:42] the seed of christ the word must come
[55:44] through his body
[55:46] now he really got hilarious evidently
[55:52] you know
[55:55] evidently enjoyed what he said
[55:59] because he said what the seed of christ
[56:01] the word
[56:02] must come through his body
[56:07] then are you getting it carnegie said
[56:09] yes just a minute now let's get quiet
[56:11] and pray and you know let's go on
[56:13] he said i want this to grind down
[56:17] the seed of christ
[56:19] must
[56:20] m-u-s-t
[56:22] must come through his body
[56:25] not through a denomination
[56:30] but through a born-again
[56:33] seed
[56:35] of the word
[56:40] must come through
[56:42] now remember what it is christ's seed
[56:46] how much
[56:48] how does my seed come
[56:50] through the body
[56:52] how does apple tree seed come through
[56:54] the body
[56:56] seed is through the body
[57:00] and christ
[57:01] is
[57:02] the body of christ or excuse me the
[57:04] church is christ is the body of christ
[57:07] that's right congregation said amen
[57:10] the bible church
[57:12] this birth produces
[57:15] that's the new birth
[57:18] himself in body his church
[57:21] is his word
[57:23] so that people can see the confirmation
[57:26] of hebrews 13 8.
[57:30] it must come through the body
[57:33] the body of christ is the bride of jesus
[57:35] christ right
[57:37] is that according to
[57:38] paul all right
[57:40] wrote it up
[57:42] excuse me not to jump up 399.
[57:45] you read in between and see if all this
[57:47] don't stay together
[57:48] but let's go to a paragraph
[57:50] 399
[57:52] still from spoken word
[57:55] oh here we're going to get in
[57:57] something deep
[57:59] now
[58:00] now watch this seed church
[58:03] this real church with a real
[58:05] true sperm
[58:11] now
[58:17] i remember
[58:18] some ministers one time saying that
[58:21] the eunuch couldn't preach because he's
[58:22] sterile
[58:28] sounds good don't it
[58:30] but i thought the ethiopian eunuch went
[58:33] down to
[58:34] egypt or where it was he went down there
[58:37] and all of them a lot of them got
[58:39] converted
[58:41] but
[58:42] he didn't have no seed
[58:50] you see folks what i put up with in my
[58:52] thoughts and then you you think i'm
[58:53] hateful
[58:56] i run into these things and you
[58:58] you know
[59:01] what do you want to do
[59:02] you want to roll up a piece of paper and
[59:03] say here's what brother brown said it
[59:05] and you won't
[59:06] cram it down the throat
[59:08] sorry i'm human
[59:10] you don't like me that's fine pray for
[59:12] me but i'm human
[59:14] right
[59:17] it gets you stirred up
[59:18] this real church with a real true sperm
[59:22] because i can call a man's name that
[59:24] they told him he couldn't even preach
[59:28] right here in this pulpit
[59:32] that this brother couldn't preach
[59:34] because he wouldn't marry it
[59:42] i said well
[59:44] paul wasn't married boy he went haywire
[59:46] paul was married he's on the sanhedrin
[59:48] had to be married to be honest i said i
[59:50] don't give a hoot what the sanhedrin
[59:51] said
[59:55] i said besides even brother branham was
[59:57] saying it's i found it showed it to him
[59:58] but that's even if it if paul said you'd
[1:00:00] have to be like me
[1:00:02] so if paul's wife was dead we'd have to
[1:00:05] kill her wife
[1:00:09] that's silly in it
[1:00:11] but it ought to strike home
[1:00:14] see the eunuch had been with the dds
[1:00:17] watch him
[1:00:19] now remember god never committed god
[1:00:21] never committed his his preaching
[1:00:24] and his gospel
[1:00:26] to an angel now you're not talking about
[1:00:27] a church age messenger
[1:00:29] not right now come on
[1:00:31] he's talking about a heavenly angel
[1:00:35] how many knows that now what's the
[1:00:37] scripture he gave
[1:00:38] how many knows that galatians 1 8 said
[1:00:41] if an angel come from heaven and preach
[1:00:44] something else besides
[1:00:46] they had preached
[1:00:50] let it be accursed
[1:00:52] so the angel is wrong if he's different
[1:00:54] from the word
[1:00:57] god came on down below angels and
[1:01:00] committed it to man
[1:01:02] which were sons
[1:01:04] you believe that
[1:01:05] but they say amen
[1:01:07] now watch now he never committed to
[1:01:09] angels
[1:01:10] notice he did not do it
[1:01:14] now philip has been up to pentecost
[1:01:18] now remember back of a mother we're
[1:01:19] talking about the word sowing and we're
[1:01:21] talking about the germ coming through
[1:01:23] the body
[1:01:26] that's what we started reading did you
[1:01:28] forget that
[1:01:30] he said the germ come through the body
[1:01:32] he said how does my germ come my seat go
[1:01:34] through the body
[1:01:36] we'll go through it watch now philip had
[1:01:38] been up at pentecost jerusalem to
[1:01:40] worship and he says amen to that the
[1:01:43] eunuch
[1:01:44] he had been with all the dds and lds and
[1:01:47] everything
[1:01:49] why didn't he get something
[1:01:53] he'd come back down see the eunuch had
[1:01:55] been up to jerusalem to worship
[1:01:57] right you know that right everybody
[1:01:59] understand
[1:02:00] he was up there at jerusalem worshiping
[1:02:03] he comes down he's sitting reading the
[1:02:04] scripture and he says this man speaking
[1:02:06] of himself
[1:02:08] or another
[1:02:09] philip took the scriptures right and
[1:02:12] what
[1:02:13] the unique he had been with the dds and
[1:02:15] ld's and everything but why didn't he
[1:02:17] get something he come back down studying
[1:02:20] the prophecy of isaiah
[1:02:22] although an angel directed philip to him
[1:02:25] once
[1:02:26] but the germ of life had to come through
[1:02:29] the body
[1:02:31] all right
[1:02:32] philip oh brother now
[1:02:35] we're on the line
[1:02:36] where did the germ come from
[1:02:38] through the angel
[1:02:41] no
[1:02:42] the angel showed him where to go
[1:02:45] an angel is a messenger here is a son
[1:02:49] philip had the germ the message the word
[1:02:53] that's how a child can be born
[1:02:56] laid his hands upon him philip baptize
[1:02:58] him in the name of jesus christ
[1:03:00] there come forth the spirit of god
[1:03:02] sure enough the germ had to come through
[1:03:05] the from the body what body christ's
[1:03:07] body correct and philip was a member of
[1:03:10] the body
[1:03:12] okay
[1:03:13] an angel directed him to peter to
[1:03:15] kinesis
[1:03:18] but where did the word come from the
[1:03:19] body oh oh oh oh
[1:03:22] i feel pretty good i feel like traveling
[1:03:24] on an angel come down and said don't
[1:03:27] worry
[1:03:28] don't call nothing unclean
[1:03:30] just go on don't think nothing
[1:03:32] and why peter spake these words
[1:03:36] not the angel not the cardinal or peter
[1:03:39] spake these words what
[1:03:42] he was the body he had the word the word
[1:03:45] took hold oh brother we
[1:03:48] oh my
[1:03:49] angel directed it but the life coming
[1:03:52] through the body
[1:03:55] and the eunuch had been up there and
[1:03:56] heard all of these
[1:03:58] but it didn't bring life
[1:04:02] peter went to the house of kines
[1:04:04] directed by an angel
[1:04:06] right
[1:04:08] an angel came to mary right
[1:04:12] but the angel said you'll be
[1:04:13] overshadowed
[1:04:15] you couldn't bring the seed
[1:04:19] come on
[1:04:23] paul on the way to damascus vision
[1:04:24] directed him right
[1:04:27] came down struck down et cetera
[1:04:31] but ananias had the germ and the word my
[1:04:34] the prophet and then i saw a vision
[1:04:37] they said go up there and lay your hands
[1:04:38] on him he said brother saul the lord
[1:04:41] appeared to you in the road coming down
[1:04:43] here
[1:04:44] how did he know
[1:04:45] he had the word
[1:04:47] the word of the lord came to the prophet
[1:04:49] prophesied went up there and said
[1:04:51] he come he sent me up here i might lay
[1:04:55] my hands upon you and you might be
[1:04:58] healed and receive the holy ghost
[1:05:01] receive your sight the scales fell off
[1:05:04] his eyes he rose was baptized in the
[1:05:07] name of jesus
[1:05:09] went out to study
[1:05:11] angel directed it that's right
[1:05:14] but paul had to see german
[1:05:17] it takes the spirit of god to seed to
[1:05:18] give life eternal
[1:05:22] and that ought to be enough right there
[1:05:23] to make us realize
[1:05:26] that faith comes by hearing
[1:05:30] and hearing by the word
[1:05:34] and how can they preach unless they be
[1:05:36] sent
[1:05:37] because if not they'll preach their own
[1:05:39] ideas
[1:05:41] and god can't quicken
[1:05:43] something that's not right
[1:05:45] did he say it in a church age book and
[1:05:47] non-seed does nothing to quicken
[1:05:50] what is non-seed
[1:05:53] scriptural terminology is what is
[1:05:55] non-seed
[1:05:57] seed without a germ of life
[1:06:00] right
[1:06:01] brother brother said the baptist has got
[1:06:03] the word
[1:06:06] come on you're going to argue with him
[1:06:11] he said they got the word
[1:06:15] but why didn't he bring the life
[1:06:18] close their own seed
[1:06:21] no germ of life
[1:06:24] no germ in the seed
[1:06:27] and we'll bring it to life
[1:06:29] all
[1:06:30] right now
[1:06:33] how does a prophet
[1:06:35] receive the word
[1:06:38] we'll speak for a little bit on this if
[1:06:39] i have to i'll cut off
[1:06:41] take it up sunday
[1:06:44] as the prophet use his own thoughts
[1:06:50] that's what i've tried my best to get
[1:06:52] you to see even about the spoken word
[1:06:54] that we'll get back to eventually
[1:06:58] why in the world didn't brother branham
[1:07:00] speak the word to cast that
[1:07:03] growth out of his wife
[1:07:08] he was a prophet
[1:07:11] but he waited on god
[1:07:14] amen
[1:07:15] yeah but i thought adoption bless god's
[1:07:17] gonna be one day when i just come out
[1:07:19] terrible
[1:07:24] no
[1:07:25] for your benefit we should be that way
[1:07:27] but i don't agree with it
[1:07:29] because i've always taught you one thing
[1:07:33] this is 40 years
[1:07:36] i've had one talk
[1:07:38] adoption is not
[1:07:40] the father going off the scene
[1:07:42] and the son coming on the scene
[1:07:45] that's what mankind teaches
[1:07:48] adoption is the sun
[1:07:50] going out of the picture
[1:07:53] and the nature of the father coming into
[1:07:55] that son that it's the very nature of
[1:07:57] almighty god
[1:07:59] dwelling in that son
[1:08:00] and then he can speak the words of god
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:04] if i'm wrong that's 40 years and i've
[1:08:06] been that away
[1:08:07] and i still believe it more today than i
[1:08:09] ever have
[1:08:11] see we think adoption over it brother
[1:08:13] dale you don't understand adoption just
[1:08:15] when he just gives me a right thinking
[1:08:16] thing i want to
[1:08:20] but roman said you have within you
[1:08:23] the ability to speak worlds into
[1:08:25] existence
[1:08:27] something to that degree maybe
[1:08:28] paraphrasing it but what'd he say he
[1:08:31] says hell by bar that you can't do it
[1:08:35] well bless god i'll just do what i want
[1:08:37] to
[1:08:38] go right ahead
[1:08:40] help yourself
[1:08:43] that's up to you
[1:08:45] but let's just think about now
[1:08:48] how
[1:08:50] god transmits
[1:08:53] his thoughts to mankind
[1:08:57] and i'll give you one in here in a
[1:08:58] minute if we have time to read it on a
[1:08:59] sunday
[1:09:00] where brother ryan says that god had a
[1:09:03] thought
[1:09:04] and said then he spoke it
[1:09:06] right and it become a word
[1:09:13] but that's always the word
[1:09:17] not like you're saying it
[1:09:21] and brother random emphasizes that when
[1:09:23] he says in the beginning was the word
[1:09:25] word was with god the word was god and
[1:09:26] the word was made
[1:09:27] he said
[1:09:29] that was genesis
[1:09:31] 1.
[1:09:35] when god said let there be
[1:09:40] but listen to what he's saying now let's
[1:09:41] see if we believe this
[1:09:44] go ahead number three
[1:09:47] which is taken from the fourth seal
[1:09:52] paragraph
[1:09:54] 67
[1:09:55] the word itself is spirit it's spirit
[1:09:57] and word form remember the other day
[1:09:59] when i gave this one you see when it
[1:10:01] when it is quickened or brought to life
[1:10:04] the spirit of the word goes to work and
[1:10:06] acts see because that
[1:10:09] now look here a thought has to be a
[1:10:11] thought
[1:10:12] before it can be a word
[1:10:15] then when a thought is presented
[1:10:18] it is a word
[1:10:21] what's it he's talking about the bible
[1:10:22] right now this is the god's thought that
[1:10:26] he has placed in the word
[1:10:29] what
[1:10:30] and when we
[1:10:34] right
[1:10:36] we
[1:10:38] everybody talking about you and me you
[1:10:40] know
[1:10:41] somebody
[1:10:43] then when we receive it from him
[1:10:46] it becomes a word
[1:10:50] talking about you and me
[1:10:54] but you see folks like i said while ago
[1:10:57] and i've still got the same thought
[1:10:59] the word come to the prophet
[1:11:03] it don't come to you and i except by way
[1:11:07] of the prophet
[1:11:10] now that's as loud as strong as i can
[1:11:12] make it
[1:11:14] yeah but brother dale i got thoughts the
[1:11:15] prophet didn't get
[1:11:18] bye-bye
[1:11:20] don't come around here
[1:11:23] we don't need it
[1:11:30] thought has to be a fault before it
[1:11:31] could be a word
[1:11:32] and then when a thought is presented his
[1:11:34] word
[1:11:35] now this is god's thoughts that he has
[1:11:36] placed in the word and then when we
[1:11:38] receive it from him it becomes a word
[1:11:41] now he illustrates it what god revealed
[1:11:43] to moses what to do
[1:11:45] moses spoke it and it happened see
[1:11:47] that's it when it really comes from god
[1:11:52] going down to the next one paragraph 289
[1:11:55] on the sixth seal
[1:12:00] he was talking about moses and his mouth
[1:12:02] and isaiah and them you know
[1:12:05] and god might have been straightened of
[1:12:06] the jews
[1:12:08] he said god put the word in moses's
[1:12:10] mouth
[1:12:12] see it's god's thoughts
[1:12:14] going into moses's heart
[1:12:18] he goes over now to express it then it
[1:12:22] becomes the word
[1:12:25] he stretched his hand forward said let
[1:12:27] there be flies
[1:12:29] and there come flies
[1:12:32] look here
[1:12:34] and if any man hurts them the two
[1:12:36] witnesses
[1:12:38] what's going to happen
[1:12:39] fire's going to proceed out of there
[1:12:41] they can speak what they want to
[1:12:45] and there it happens
[1:12:46] so there's more to come right
[1:12:50] look at the next one
[1:12:54] which is laura grace
[1:12:57] 1954
[1:12:59] 1006.
[1:13:01] he's talking about sunday he's talking
[1:13:02] about when he's talking about when god
[1:13:03] speaks it has to be so
[1:13:06] there is
[1:13:07] no way at all to get away from it god
[1:13:10] said let there be it has to be now the
[1:13:13] very word itself and the word was a
[1:13:15] thought
[1:13:16] god when he before
[1:13:18] a word is an expression
[1:13:21] of a thought
[1:13:24] god thought in his mind
[1:13:32] it into existence
[1:13:34] god thought
[1:13:38] well i thought it's always the word it
[1:13:39] just this goes back and you just don't
[1:13:41] understand brother there's always been
[1:13:43] the word
[1:13:45] why did the prophet spend so much time
[1:13:47] bringing down the logos theophany the
[1:13:50] the speech the word of god
[1:13:55] and why is it that
[1:13:57] the bible says
[1:13:59] that jesus christ created all things
[1:14:03] why it says
[1:14:05] without him there was not anything said
[1:14:07] that was said
[1:14:10] it's easy to understand he's that right
[1:14:13] look at the next one
[1:14:18] this is uh
[1:14:19] letting off the pressure 62
[1:14:21] 609 evening
[1:14:23] uh eve
[1:14:25] 68.
[1:14:26] you bring it all the way down you read
[1:14:28] all you want to to hedge your sword word
[1:14:29] coming sharpen it into edgy sword listen
[1:14:32] to the word amy believes that in the
[1:14:33] beginning was the word
[1:14:37] that's first it was a thought
[1:14:40] and it has to be a thought
[1:14:42] then
[1:14:43] when it's expressed it becomes a word
[1:14:46] and then in the beginning was the word
[1:14:48] in the word with god and the word
[1:14:50] was god when he spoke it
[1:14:54] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[1:14:56] among us
[1:14:58] when he spoke it
[1:15:00] all right
[1:15:01] you see church that's why i can't
[1:15:02] understand why people don't want to go
[1:15:04] with a message so beautiful
[1:15:08] and to realize that brother branham
[1:15:10] brought us
[1:15:11] the thoughts of god
[1:15:18] i don't understand
[1:15:20] one right after all the garbage can
[1:15:23] who is this melchizedek
[1:15:24] 65
[1:15:26] paragraph 6 55
[1:15:29] notice now his attribute then the
[1:15:30] attribute was first god
[1:15:33] the thought the attribute itself
[1:15:35] all in one without being expressed
[1:15:39] then when he expressed
[1:15:40] secondarily
[1:15:42] he became then
[1:15:44] the word and then the word was made
[1:15:46] flesh and dwelt among us it goes to john
[1:15:48] giving in to begin in the beginning was
[1:15:50] the word
[1:15:51] when the time begun it was word but
[1:15:53] before it was word
[1:15:55] it was an attribute a thought
[1:15:59] then it was expressed in the beginning
[1:16:01] was the expression
[1:16:03] the word
[1:16:05] going to the next
[1:16:08] god hiding in simplicity
[1:16:10] okay well let's finish that first first
[1:16:12] being with spirit god's supernatural all
[1:16:14] right to eternal secondly he begin to
[1:16:16] form himself towards flesh and at the
[1:16:18] often is called the word a body this
[1:16:21] then is the state he was in when he met
[1:16:23] abraham what's called male charity
[1:16:26] now did not god just speak a body into
[1:16:28] existence
[1:16:30] he can speak what about your
[1:16:32] prophet going to the next one
[1:16:36] going to hide it in simplicity 63 412
[1:16:39] 261.
[1:16:41] now if the blood of bulls and ghosts
[1:16:43] could give a power to moses
[1:16:46] to go out there by the commission of god
[1:16:50] and stretch forth that rod and say that
[1:16:52] there come flies
[1:16:54] he had the word of god
[1:16:57] and he spoke that word and when he did
[1:16:59] it become from god's thoughts
[1:17:02] a word is a thought expressed
[1:17:05] and so then when god thought it
[1:17:07] and put it in moses's mind
[1:17:11] and he spoke it
[1:17:12] it become a word
[1:17:14] and moses turned around and went back
[1:17:16] maybe not a fly in the country you know
[1:17:18] what happened
[1:17:19] the creative word of god that was spoke
[1:17:21] by the lips of a mortal man
[1:17:25] god uses men
[1:17:26] god could have used the son to preach
[1:17:28] the gospel he could have used the wind
[1:17:30] to preach the gospel but god chose men
[1:17:32] to preach the gospel
[1:17:35] what about it
[1:17:37] look at the next one
[1:17:42] it's taken from the third seal 63 320.
[1:17:45] paragraph 97
[1:17:48] before a word it's a thought
[1:17:51] and a thought has to be created
[1:17:54] all right
[1:17:55] so god's thoughts
[1:17:57] became creation
[1:17:59] when it was spoke by word
[1:18:02] now does that come on all the way down
[1:18:04] to where brother random and the lord
[1:18:05] said what do you need you need squirrels
[1:18:12] any problem
[1:18:13] he said
[1:18:15] under the blood of bulls and goats they
[1:18:16] spoke god's word
[1:18:18] come on
[1:18:19] so god's thoughts become creation when
[1:18:21] it was spoke by word that's when he
[1:18:23] presents it to you
[1:18:25] to you as a thought
[1:18:28] his thoughts
[1:18:30] and it's revealed to you
[1:18:33] hold on
[1:18:36] then it's still a thought until you
[1:18:39] speak it
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:44] all right
[1:18:45] that's the reason moses went out
[1:18:47] to pray that pillar of fire hanging
[1:18:49] around him and he said go hold your
[1:18:52] stick towards the east and say call for
[1:18:54] a fly
[1:18:55] and there's no flies
[1:18:57] but he went
[1:18:58] and held
[1:18:59] the stick there and said let there be
[1:19:02] flies
[1:19:03] no flies at all yet went on back
[1:19:05] but the word god's thought
[1:19:08] had already been spoken
[1:19:11] it's a word
[1:19:12] now it's got to happen
[1:19:16] go on to the next
[1:19:22] this is taken from the absolute 62
[1:19:25] and a word
[1:19:27] and now a word is a thought expressed
[1:19:31] first it must be a thought
[1:19:33] and it becomes a word
[1:19:36] because you do not speak
[1:19:38] your words
[1:19:40] without thought
[1:19:43] now i've seen a lot of people that i'd
[1:19:45] almost argue about that
[1:19:47] because their mouth is constantly
[1:19:49] running and i know they ain't thinking
[1:19:54] forgive me
[1:19:57] but they still got to think
[1:20:00] right
[1:20:01] you can't say anything unless you think
[1:20:03] it
[1:20:04] you want to quote where the prophet said
[1:20:05] you can't say cat unless you think cat
[1:20:08] i'm just being a little
[1:20:10] obnoxious
[1:20:12] all right
[1:20:13] go to the next one
[1:20:21] this is taken from the message letting
[1:20:22] off the pressure of 62.
[1:20:24] and immediately believe that in the
[1:20:26] beginning was the word
[1:20:29] that's first it was a thought
[1:20:31] it has to be a thought then when it's
[1:20:33] expressed it becomes a word
[1:20:35] and then in the beginning was the word
[1:20:37] and words with god and the word was god
[1:20:39] when he spoke it and the word becomes
[1:20:41] flesh and dwelt among us
[1:20:43] i gave that a while ago
[1:20:45] it's in there twice
[1:20:47] all right
[1:20:52] go on to the next one let's see what it
[1:20:53] is
[1:20:54] i gave you the wrong
[1:20:56] all right this is number 12.
[1:20:58] this is taken for the word made flesh in
[1:21:00] the india trip
[1:21:01] 54.
[1:21:03] god's thoughts expressed through those
[1:21:05] mortal lips of isaiah
[1:21:09] a man with sin
[1:21:10] and things i have
[1:21:13] with his ups and downs like i have and
[1:21:16] like you have
[1:21:18] but a yielded vessel to god
[1:21:20] expressed the thought
[1:21:22] gods thought through word
[1:21:25] and no matter what they done
[1:21:27] isaiah's words had to be fulfilled
[1:21:30] because for it was god's thought
[1:21:32] expressed through
[1:21:35] isaiah
[1:21:37] what about it
[1:21:39] words expressed through isaiah
[1:21:42] look at this next one taken from
[1:21:43] believing god 1957
[1:21:46] e45
[1:21:50] and now watch i've seen it work
[1:21:52] and to think if you'll get into the
[1:21:54] to that contact with god
[1:21:56] it becomes
[1:21:58] till it isn't your voice anymore
[1:22:01] it's not your thought anymore
[1:22:04] it becomes god's thought
[1:22:07] in god's voice
[1:22:08] you're just a vine or just a branch
[1:22:11] he's a vine
[1:22:13] and if your spirit that goes in and
[1:22:14] energizes as long as you can get
[1:22:16] yourself out of the way
[1:22:19] he will fill it up
[1:22:20] and then when you can be a witness just
[1:22:22] like mo noah's ark was a witness like
[1:22:25] jesus was a witness of god
[1:22:28] he become so full of god till him and
[1:22:31] god was one god dwelled in christ
[1:22:33] reconciling the world to himself the
[1:22:35] very expression
[1:22:37] now
[1:22:42] what about it
[1:22:45] of course i know what most people think
[1:22:48] they think all of these quotes that i've
[1:22:50] given tonight it even said we and us and
[1:22:53] you
[1:22:55] they think that they only pertain
[1:22:58] to brother branham in his speaking
[1:23:02] that's what you believe go ahead and
[1:23:03] believe what you believe
[1:23:06] but you see
[1:23:08] i believe
[1:23:10] still today faith cometh by hearing
[1:23:14] and hearing comes by the word
[1:23:16] and i still believe that somebody's got
[1:23:18] to speak it to us
[1:23:21] and i believe you sisters
[1:23:25] could help us if we listen to you
[1:23:29] because you can get a thought from god
[1:23:31] and you can speak it to us
[1:23:36] what kind of spirit would it be to say
[1:23:38] i'm not going to listen to no woman
[1:23:40] can you tell me what that spirit is
[1:23:46] but what about it
[1:23:49] it becomes god's
[1:23:51] thought
[1:23:53] and god's voice
[1:23:58] i thought we believed that in the days
[1:23:59] of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:24:02] meaning that voice was still
[1:24:04] on magnetic tape systems or whatever
[1:24:07] we're doing going around the world
[1:24:12] but i believe there's got to be a bride
[1:24:14] to receive that word
[1:24:17] or else why bring it
[1:24:20] if it's not for someone
[1:24:23] see we believe well it was for the
[1:24:24] prophet well amen we don't have no
[1:24:26] problems
[1:24:28] but the prophet is one that said the
[1:24:30] fivefold ministry
[1:24:33] would take this and break it down to it
[1:24:35] the bible's one that said that
[1:24:38] he said it they'd take this and carry it
[1:24:40] on to the coming of the lord
[1:24:42] you know
[1:24:47] but you see
[1:24:48] are we turning down the vessel
[1:24:54] now don't you agree let's see
[1:24:59] when moses went out there
[1:25:02] god wanted to speak to all the people
[1:25:05] right
[1:25:06] he wanted to speak to all of them
[1:25:09] and they chose moses to speak
[1:25:13] well
[1:25:16] now did that change god
[1:25:20] or was it it just changed the vessel
[1:25:26] the the ability
[1:25:28] to bring it forth
[1:25:30] right
[1:25:32] because just because man was accepted
[1:25:35] did that
[1:25:36] change god no
[1:25:39] because in prophets
[1:25:41] they never said nothing
[1:25:42] until they had thus saith the lord
[1:25:46] they waited on god to bring the message
[1:25:49] to him
[1:25:52] and when they did they spoke it
[1:25:58] it was written down you know and taken
[1:26:00] and doing and made a bible
[1:26:03] and you and i can read that bible
[1:26:08] and the prophet then he said okay
[1:26:11] i'll give you a message
[1:26:14] fourteen hundred sermons
[1:26:16] the only time that it was capable of
[1:26:19] recording the messenger's message
[1:26:22] you know
[1:26:24] very little writings of luther wesley or
[1:26:26] whatever you know
[1:26:28] small amounts of things
[1:26:29] compared
[1:26:31] to what you and i have
[1:26:35] we have a message that we believe was
[1:26:37] god's message
[1:26:39] sent to us to a prophet
[1:26:43] and we believe so much until we believe
[1:26:45] that the bible is right when it said
[1:26:48] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:26:50] heaven
[1:26:51] with a shout
[1:26:53] voice of an archangel and a trumpet
[1:26:56] we believe this message was the
[1:26:57] descendant of god
[1:27:01] through a prophet
[1:27:06] but i guess all we're supposed to do is
[1:27:08] just sit around and
[1:27:11] wait
[1:27:16] nope
[1:27:19] i've always been blunt plain straight
[1:27:21] just tell it like i believe it
[1:27:23] if you're waiting on brother random to
[1:27:25] come back to preach to us we got to be
[1:27:28] ready to hear it
[1:27:29] i've said that from day one i still say
[1:27:32] it
[1:27:34] we've got to have the foundation laid
[1:27:37] how long do you think it would take him
[1:27:39] to come back now and re-preach
[1:27:42] to god try to get the people to believe
[1:27:43] the word
[1:27:45] took him 30-something years to be able
[1:27:46] to preach the statue of a perfect man
[1:27:47] that's what he said
[1:27:52] and i've never said
[1:27:54] that there wasn't going to be anything
[1:27:56] like that
[1:28:00] because i said he could come back and
[1:28:01] preach to us
[1:28:06] but i still believe the bible says
[1:28:08] they
[1:28:10] which is the one that's going on
[1:28:14] without us
[1:28:16] cannot be made perfect or brought back
[1:28:19] to the right position
[1:28:21] i believe it's you and i that's going to
[1:28:22] call him out of the ground
[1:28:24] i have no problem with him preaching to
[1:28:26] us that he does that they never have
[1:28:30] been misunderstood totally
[1:28:32] but i'm not just sitting down waiting
[1:28:33] either
[1:28:37] at least we ought to be prepared
[1:28:40] and believe it
[1:28:43] the only way we can be prepared and
[1:28:44] believe it is believe what he's saying
[1:28:48] amen
[1:28:52] and believe who we
[1:28:54] are because there's a message there
[1:28:57] called recognizing
[1:28:59] your day
[1:29:00] in this message
[1:29:04] even though martin luther brought the
[1:29:06] message of the justice league by faith
[1:29:08] there was a people took that message and
[1:29:10] made it alive
[1:29:13] even though john wesley brought
[1:29:15] sanctification there was a people
[1:29:18] who brought that message alive
[1:29:20] and put missionaries around the world
[1:29:24] even though the holy ghost fell on azusa
[1:29:26] street
[1:29:28] it was still a people and to make that
[1:29:30] alive
[1:29:34] but do we believe the things that he
[1:29:35] said
[1:29:38] pull up number 14 there and let's just
[1:29:40] read a couple of messages then we'll
[1:29:41] quit
[1:29:44] this is taken from the message escape
[1:29:47] hither come quickly 58 202 e54
[1:29:52] now if your life tallies up to the life
[1:29:54] of jesus christ
[1:29:57] now
[1:29:58] you can see immediately
[1:30:02] there's going to be conditions
[1:30:04] upon a lot of time
[1:30:07] but brother dale it says out in the
[1:30:08] bible if you say
[1:30:12] go reading a little bit further
[1:30:16] and it says if you don't repent
[1:30:21] and forgive people
[1:30:23] god won't forgive you
[1:30:28] you mean this message is just for any
[1:30:29] joe blow
[1:30:32] he says i believe the prophet
[1:30:35] live like the devil
[1:30:37] i'm not in that day i'm sorry
[1:30:41] now if your life tallies up to the life
[1:30:43] of jesus christ
[1:30:45] that is
[1:30:46] he said in his word there if you say to
[1:30:48] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:30:51] but believe that it's coming to pass
[1:30:53] and you can have what you say
[1:30:55] what you say
[1:30:57] the only way you could move that
[1:30:59] mountain would have to be deity speaking
[1:31:03] when you're a son of god
[1:31:06] you receive god which is zoe
[1:31:08] god's own life
[1:31:10] then you become a part of god
[1:31:13] then if your objective is right and your
[1:31:16] motive is right
[1:31:20] it's not for everybody
[1:31:24] this message is not for everybody
[1:31:28] it's for a selected group of people that
[1:31:30] can believe it
[1:31:32] look at the next one
[1:31:35] taken from the tested time
[1:31:38] 58 530
[1:31:40] e14
[1:31:43] if you say to this mountain be moved not
[1:31:45] if i say
[1:31:46] if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:31:48] and we know that man could not move a
[1:31:50] mountain just by speaking to it
[1:31:53] the only thing could do that would be
[1:31:55] deity
[1:31:56] so then
[1:31:57] if the mountain is before us
[1:32:00] and our objective is right and our
[1:32:01] motive is right
[1:32:03] then it isn't us speaking anymore
[1:32:06] it's deity speaking
[1:32:08] then it has to move
[1:32:10] i truly believe that the church
[1:32:12] is on the brink of one of the greatest
[1:32:14] outpourings that has ever that it's ever
[1:32:18] had in this age
[1:32:20] i believe it
[1:32:21] i can't say the lord told me
[1:32:23] but it's just something inside me just
[1:32:26] catching a hold of something that i
[1:32:29] haven't seen
[1:32:31] all my life until just now
[1:32:33] and how glorious it is to know
[1:32:36] just before the coming of the lord that
[1:32:38] these things are happening
[1:32:41] what about it
[1:32:43] do we believe it
[1:32:45] the prophet's still talking
[1:32:50] look at this one
[1:32:51] wait with the next one number 16
[1:32:53] philadelphian i'm excited with perkman
[1:32:55] church h
[1:32:57] 60 1207.
[1:33:00] paragraph 91
[1:33:02] now he is the living word
[1:33:05] and this wrote on the bible is part of
[1:33:06] him then if you can receive this
[1:33:11] and remember the whole message behind
[1:33:15] you
[1:33:15] get the thought
[1:33:18] it's your thought
[1:33:23] it's got to be he said revealed remember
[1:33:25] the quote
[1:33:27] he said then you speak it
[1:33:30] oh i got a good thought
[1:33:33] you remember the man that
[1:33:35] told brother branham said i won't
[1:33:36] straighten out a little bit on your
[1:33:38] marriage to divorce issue you remember
[1:33:40] that
[1:33:42] he said i had a vision brother branham
[1:33:44] and he said i immediately seen he had a
[1:33:46] dream
[1:33:49] but he said all that was well and good
[1:33:50] which is not according to scripture
[1:33:54] so no matter what our thoughts are
[1:33:57] amen
[1:34:00] it's got to be according to the word
[1:34:02] you remember one time there in the bible
[1:34:04] where
[1:34:09] they said well we've got to talk that
[1:34:10] land is ours
[1:34:12] let's go get it that's right
[1:34:14] they eating our wheat
[1:34:17] the prophet said don't go
[1:34:19] that's right
[1:34:22] well i got it thus saith the lord
[1:34:24] brother branham said they said
[1:34:27] but that won't work
[1:34:32] it's got to be in his word
[1:34:35] see part of him then you can receive
[1:34:37] this into him which is the word this
[1:34:39] word comes into you by faith makes it
[1:34:42] alive because oh catch that the word
[1:34:45] comes into you if the holy spirit's in
[1:34:47] there it's alive as soon as it comes in
[1:34:50] all right
[1:34:51] and every promise is true nothing
[1:34:54] therefore you say to this mountain be
[1:34:55] moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:34:57] because what
[1:34:58] you are deity speaking
[1:35:01] you believe it
[1:35:03] the bible said so
[1:35:05] and whatever you say shall come to piss
[1:35:07] if you'll not doubt
[1:35:09] if you can get all of the
[1:35:12] the world bred out of you
[1:35:15] let the holy spirit make you a full
[1:35:17] son and daughter of god
[1:35:20] no world no condemnation no doubt what
[1:35:22] is it then
[1:35:23] it's no more you
[1:35:26] it's god in you
[1:35:27] and you take his word
[1:35:29] you remember the whole thing that i've
[1:35:30] emphasized it's not you
[1:35:33] it's god doing it
[1:35:35] it's a promise to say father it's your
[1:35:37] promise satan
[1:35:39] something has got to move
[1:35:41] all right look at the next one
[1:35:48] this is taken from the presence of god
[1:35:50] 64 6
[1:35:52] 18. if you'll notice i go before and
[1:35:53] after
[1:35:54] sealed on a lot of the quotes
[1:35:56] because i want you to see it was back
[1:35:58] there and it's down here
[1:36:00] god don't dwell in big buildings
[1:36:03] he dwells in your heart
[1:36:05] god don't dwell in intellectual
[1:36:08] education
[1:36:09] he's far from it
[1:36:10] he dwells in humility
[1:36:13] in your heart he dwells in his word and
[1:36:16] his word comes into your heart
[1:36:19] and speaks itself out speaks itself out
[1:36:22] and it declares
[1:36:23] he interprets his own word
[1:36:25] through you
[1:36:28] he is trying to find somebody
[1:36:31] to get a hold of
[1:36:32] to show
[1:36:33] that he's still god
[1:36:36] and
[1:36:37] he is he will do that if he can just get
[1:36:40] somebody
[1:36:41] he can speak to
[1:36:42] once
[1:36:43] if he can get another woman
[1:36:46] with a blood issue
[1:36:48] he can still speak the same thing
[1:36:50] he can still do the same thing
[1:36:53] making known declaring we're in the
[1:36:55] presence of god
[1:36:57] not recognized
[1:36:59] go ahead we've got a couple more
[1:37:03] next one is programming church age page
[1:37:05] 170
[1:37:06] church age book
[1:37:09] now then this word he has left behind on
[1:37:11] the printed page is a part of him
[1:37:14] when you accept it by faith into a
[1:37:16] spirit-filled life
[1:37:18] he said his word was life john 6 63 be
[1:37:22] that is exactly what he is i am the way
[1:37:25] the truth and the life if any man have
[1:37:27] not the spirit of christ is none of his
[1:37:29] romans 8 9
[1:37:31] there it is
[1:37:33] his spirit in his life
[1:37:35] and exactly what the word is
[1:37:38] and it's exactly what jesus is he is the
[1:37:40] word so when a spirit-born spirit-filled
[1:37:43] man in faith
[1:37:45] takes that word into his heart
[1:37:47] and place it upon his lips
[1:37:49] well that is the same as deity speaking
[1:37:51] every mountain has to go
[1:37:53] satan cannot stand before that man
[1:37:56] must be talking about somebody
[1:38:01] well brother dale we've always believed
[1:38:03] that
[1:38:04] the word comes to the prophet
[1:38:06] i hope i've said that enough through the
[1:38:07] message
[1:38:08] to believe
[1:38:10] that the word come through the prophet
[1:38:13] see then i get the thought
[1:38:16] you notice a lot of people just take
[1:38:17] scriptures
[1:38:18] and they'll just run with it
[1:38:20] and others i'll just take quotes and run
[1:38:22] with it
[1:38:26] why don't you intermingle them
[1:38:29] together
[1:38:33] because this prophet can't speak
[1:38:34] anything contrary to what the bible's
[1:38:35] written
[1:38:37] amen come on
[1:38:41] but listen
[1:38:42] we said well brother dale the word only
[1:38:44] comes to the prophet
[1:38:47] the message has come to the prophet
[1:38:49] we're not looking for another man to
[1:38:51] come
[1:38:52] to bring us a message
[1:38:53] we're not looking for a brother dale to
[1:38:55] raise up with a certain and he takes
[1:38:57] over into
[1:38:58] no
[1:39:00] not looking for anybody else to do it
[1:39:03] looking for a bride
[1:39:07] to do it
[1:39:08] but look at the lights when they want to
[1:39:10] take
[1:39:11] page 164 to pergamon church age church
[1:39:14] age book
[1:39:16] remember now john the baptist was both
[1:39:19] the prophet and the messenger of his day
[1:39:21] he was filled with the holy ghost from
[1:39:23] his mother's womb
[1:39:25] when he was baptizing in jordan the word
[1:39:27] of god jesus came to him
[1:39:29] the word
[1:39:31] always comes
[1:39:32] to the truly spirit field
[1:39:36] okay
[1:39:39] that is the evidence of being filled
[1:39:40] with the holy ghost
[1:39:42] that is what jesus said would be the
[1:39:43] evidence
[1:39:45] he said i will pray the father and he'll
[1:39:46] send you another comforter let me abide
[1:39:48] with you forever even the spirit of
[1:39:50] truth whom the world cannot receive now
[1:39:52] we know what truth is
[1:39:58] back on some scripture i think i was
[1:40:00] using sunday
[1:40:01] why do you not understand my speech
[1:40:04] even because you cannot hear my word
[1:40:07] did you notice that jesus said that the
[1:40:09] world could not receive the holy ghost
[1:40:13] well
[1:40:14] in this verse i just read
[1:40:17] neither could they receive the word
[1:40:21] why because the spirit and the word are
[1:40:24] one
[1:40:25] and if you have the holy spirit
[1:40:28] as the prophets
[1:40:30] the word would come to you
[1:40:33] you would receive it
[1:40:38] i believe the word comes to the spirit
[1:40:39] field
[1:40:44] i believe this message
[1:40:45] has already come
[1:40:47] the world can't receive this message
[1:40:51] because he don't have the holy ghost
[1:40:53] all right
[1:40:54] he said well brother dale what are you
[1:40:55] expecting to happen
[1:40:57] i expect things to get a whole lot worse
[1:40:59] than what it is number one
[1:41:02] not a doomsday preacher but just plain
[1:41:04] language
[1:41:06] because we're going to be about to be
[1:41:07] tried
[1:41:08] to see whether or not we'll stay with
[1:41:10] the word
[1:41:13] you know old age may be a gift to some
[1:41:15] of us
[1:41:18] we may not live to see things
[1:41:25] come on
[1:41:27] where somebody is amen
[1:41:30] somebody is going to become the word
[1:41:34] because the prophet has already said it
[1:41:38] somebody
[1:41:39] is going to come to the basis by the
[1:41:42] prophet's message
[1:41:44] to believe god's word
[1:41:48] somebody's going to walk off this earth
[1:41:50] in that word
[1:41:53] why can't we contend we're part of it
[1:41:59] but you see church it's got to be
[1:42:00] revealed
[1:42:03] when god is not quotes on a page come on
[1:42:06] that's right one god is not quotes on a
[1:42:08] page
[1:42:10] you know yourself the world is dying
[1:42:13] fighting over matthew 28 19 and acts 2
[1:42:16] 38.
[1:42:22] one said it's father son and holy ghost
[1:42:23] one saying this
[1:42:27] lord jesus christ
[1:42:29] what do we say it is
[1:42:33] i've told you i've heard people in this
[1:42:34] message say
[1:42:36] we take acts 2 38
[1:42:39] they take
[1:42:40] matthew 28 19 i told him and i said if
[1:42:44] they'd take
[1:42:45] matthew 28 19 they'd come out and
[1:42:47] baptize you in the name of the lord
[1:42:48] jesus christ
[1:42:51] that's the only way you can take it
[1:42:56] listen
[1:42:58] getting ready for sunday
[1:43:04] then
[1:43:06] a prophet saying we were born
[1:43:08] with this seed in us
[1:43:11] let's let him answer
[1:43:14] what that is
[1:43:18] because
[1:43:19] he was the one who had the message
[1:43:23] well it's just what you say
[1:43:26] well
[1:43:29] if i said anything wrong tonight i want
[1:43:31] somebody to show me
[1:43:32] where i said it
[1:43:34] but if i say what he said
[1:43:37] and i don't have to worry about it
[1:43:42] but i believe the word's going to be
[1:43:43] made alive in somebody
[1:43:46] somebody's going to walk off this earth
[1:43:50] why can't we believe it's us let's stand
[1:43:53] a germatized seed
[1:43:55] has this message
[1:43:58] become a seed in your heart a germ in
[1:44:01] your heart
[1:44:04] has it become real
[1:44:06] to you and i
[1:44:08] or is it just quotes on a page
[1:44:13] or is it really a revelation
[1:44:19] if it's revelation you're not going to
[1:44:20] be spending your time trying to correct
[1:44:22] the messenger
[1:44:25] all right
[1:44:27] you're not going to do that go ahead
[1:44:28] what do we got
[1:44:32] anybody have a need
[1:44:59] amen
[1:45:12] i wish i had a voice to be able to sing
[1:45:14] that
[1:45:16] would you sing it unto him and think
[1:45:17] about him
[1:45:29] would you know the peace
[1:45:31] that comes by giving all
[1:45:34] would you have him save yourself
[1:45:40] let him have his way
[1:45:44] we've had a message
[1:45:48] what we need is the holy spirit to
[1:45:50] quicken out
[1:45:57] but you know what
[1:45:59] he said it
[1:46:01] and it will come to pies
[1:46:06] somebody
[1:46:08] is going to fulfill this word
[1:46:11] why can't we believe we're part of it
[1:46:15] yeah but brother dale i got too many
[1:46:16] problems you want to run that quote back
[1:46:20] where are you talking about isaiah
[1:46:22] now having his ups and downs in this
[1:46:24] problem he said like i have
[1:46:27] that didn't change god
[1:46:35] he didn't change god
[1:46:40] he's going to bring his word
[1:46:49] you know in brother branham's ministry
[1:46:53] the gift was taken away for about five
[1:46:55] years let me remember that
[1:47:00] about five years
[1:47:02] the gift was taken away from brother
[1:47:04] branham
[1:47:06] would you show me in that five years
[1:47:09] that he wasn't still preaching the word
[1:47:15] it's just a gift
[1:47:18] he was still standing there he was still
[1:47:20] praying and people were still being
[1:47:22] healed delivered saved
[1:47:31] then one day it came back
[1:47:36] what about it
[1:47:40] during that period of time to ask him so
[1:47:42] what he's doing he said i'm going to
[1:47:43] show and see
[1:47:47] he never quit
[1:47:50] he was still on the field
[1:47:54] traveling and preaching
[1:47:56] and didn't have that gift that he'd
[1:47:58] stood there with
[1:48:00] but you know what he was still a prophet
[1:48:03] you know what those messages he preached
[1:48:05] in that period of time is still part of
[1:48:07] the message
[1:48:14] because this is a message this is not
[1:48:15] just
[1:48:17] gifts and signs and wonders
[1:48:20] it could be a live word
[1:48:23] but i believe the bride is going to be
[1:48:25] the alive word
[1:48:41] praise the lord
[1:48:46] the lord
[1:48:49] praise the lord
[1:48:52] let all god's people praise the lord
[1:48:55] right
[1:48:58] shake off those heavy man
[1:49:02] and lift up those holy hands
[1:49:05] oh god

[1:49:26] i will
[1:49:28] i'll be somewhere
[1:49:31] listening for my name right
