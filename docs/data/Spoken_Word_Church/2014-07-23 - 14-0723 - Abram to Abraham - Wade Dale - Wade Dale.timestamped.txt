[7:26] Atlanta that's not good they had need to
[7:30] have a new song leader so they wanted
[7:33] brother Bud G Diner to lead the singing
[7:36] and he liked that I feel like traveling
[7:38] on and the sun will never go down in the
[7:41] city and looked over Jordan he liked
[7:45] them three songs and he done them three

[19:47] June and I be going into to Oklahoma
[19:49] during the Labor Day weekend to be
[19:51] brother Claud and sister junor for a few
[19:53] days so keep us in your prayers also
[19:55] remember the four families of the loved
[19:57] ones that were were lost I don't know if
[20:00] some of you knew it or not but that
[20:01] plane crash in Arizona was four young
[20:04] believers that left brother Dalton's
[20:06] church Sunday morning and was flying
[20:10] back
[20:10] somewhere and they were killed in the
[20:14] accident and actually one of them the
[20:17] Jonathan McGary was brother Gerald
[20:20] Hughes son's wife's brother so uh she
[20:25] her name is Sister Leona so remember her
[20:27] in your prayers called him yesterday and
[20:29] obviously they're already out there and
[20:32] uh for the funeral so just remember them
[20:34] they were very young um but the Lord
[20:37] Knows Best he knows uh he knows what
[20:40] he's doing we don't we don't question we
[20:43] don't question the word of the lord we
[20:45] don't question what he does we just say
[20:47] thank you Lord that they had time on the
[20:50] earth and that they were good Christian
[20:53] uh young men the 18 to 20 25 years old
[20:57] so just keep the family in the prayers
[20:59] one girl was from Germany one was from
[21:00] Canada so there's families from all over
[21:02] that are affected by that so just
[21:05] remember them so let's turn our Bibles
[21:08] to
[21:09] Romans
[21:11] 4 and get started I it's a little
[21:14] thought that I had been uh kind of
[21:18] running around in my head then we spoke
[21:20] on it just a little bit briefly in
[21:22] Sunday school um this past week and
[21:28] we're going to speak on from Abram to
[21:29] Abraham but a lot of people take and and
[21:32] I think they take Abram and they do away
[21:35] with
[21:36] Abram and put it all on
[21:39] Abraham but remember Abram got
[21:44] promise Abram produced a child and we
[21:47] think oh that was a bad child well the
[21:49] Bible doesn't say that the Bible said he
[21:52] would be a wild child but the Bible I'm
[21:54] going to read you the Bible gave him
[21:56] promise too so there was promised is
[21:58] there but I want you to see I was
[21:59] talking about in the in the Sunday
[22:01] school class we go and type as and we're
[22:05] going to tonight we're going to go
[22:06] through the Book of Genesis where
[22:09] Abraham took a journey or Abram took a
[22:12] journey but I want you to see that that
[22:16] that's a type of me and you we know that
[22:18] for a fact but also even after we're
[22:20] born again you know we believe as as a
[22:23] church body here we believe that that
[22:25] you go through justification not just
[22:27] one
[22:28] time amen you go through baby form
[22:32] justification that cuts off your past
[22:35] sins does away with your past and starts
[22:38] you on a journey then when you come into
[22:41] the body and then when you come into the
[22:43] statue of a perfect man there's another
[22:45] part of justification a a a secret part
[22:48] or a mysterious part of justification
[22:51] that we go back through all right and
[22:53] then in The Headstone there's another
[22:55] part a higher form of justification
[22:57] brother R I'm Tau this you know he
[22:59] didn't teach it verbatim but he said
[23:01] there's a mysterious part of
[23:02] justification that we need to know
[23:04] there's a mysterious part of
[23:05] sanctification that we need to know all
[23:07] right so I believe Abram shows that even
[23:10] to Abraham but let's don't throw the
[23:12] baby out with the bath water because
[23:14] Abram got some promises and and put this
[23:17] little seed in your mind we in the end
[23:20] time have been given a
[23:23] mandate for a body change that's our
[23:26] mandate that's our requirement we're not
[23:29] required to just go through a church age
[23:31] and just be good and just be all right
[23:33] we have a mandate to take a body change
[23:37] we have it's not been given to anyone
[23:39] else it's been given to this age this
[23:42] message and this group of people the
[23:44] people that are dead and G on they
[23:46] cannot fulfill
[23:48] that
[23:51] amen they're part of that
[23:53] Abram which produced something but
[23:57] didn't produce the a promise and then
[23:59] we're going to see that we're going to
[24:01] read a quote here in a few minutes where
[24:02] brother Brown said every son of the
[24:04] faith has got to take this
[24:06] journey in the Final End no one else can
[24:09] take that Journey Brother Dean except
[24:11] the ones in this Final End so let's
[24:14] narrow this thing down tonight that that
[24:16] mandate is for you and I that are still
[24:21] alive not the
[24:24] Dead the Abraham Covenant right
[24:28] wasn't the Abram Covenant sure he got
[24:30] what he needed he got land and stuff but
[24:33] the Abraham Covenant was a body change
[24:36] to produce a child all right so you love
[24:40] the Lord so let's get started let's bow
[24:43] our heads and and pray before we before
[24:45] we begin but just keep your Bibles
[24:47] because we're not going to when we get
[24:49] to Genesis 12 we're not going to put it
[24:50] on the screen we're going to read it out
[24:52] of our Bible cuz I want you to look down
[24:54] and see it instead of reading it from
[24:56] here so no cheating tonight I mean
[24:57] there're going to put it up but I want
[24:58] you to read it in the Bible all right so
[25:01] let's bow our heads and keep these
[25:02] families in mind losing these young ones
[25:05] and uh uh only God knows but you know we
[25:08] don't
[25:09] question but you know what all their
[25:12] trials are
[25:14] over their trials are done they don't
[25:16] have to get up and go to work they don't
[25:17] have to pay a bill anymore they're in
[25:18] the presence of God so which one's
[25:22] better which one's better amen amen dear
[25:26] heavenly father we pray Lord that you
[25:27] would take care of us tonight lead us
[25:29] and guide us you be the speaker you be
[25:32] the hearer you be the active participant
[25:35] in the service father because without
[25:37] you we're just standing here talking
[25:39] about something that we have an
[25:41] intellectual concept of but Lord if
[25:43] you'll come and Quicken
[25:46] the the power that's behind it that this
[25:50] Words As It Goes Forth that you heal the
[25:52] people that you deliver them that they
[25:54] see their self in the scripture that
[25:56] it's not just Abram in Abraham but it's
[25:59] put your name in there and Lord we pray
[26:02] that you just bless each one thank you
[26:03] for bringing each one together tonight
[26:05] we pray Lord especially for that family
[26:07] out in Arizona Lord and different parts
[26:10] of the world that were affected by the
[26:11] plane crash lord it's like I said you
[26:15] you're the one that knows you know best
[26:17] for each one and when our time's done
[26:19] our time should be done and we go home
[26:22] to see you thank God thank you Lord that
[26:24] they were Christians their report of all
[26:27] the ones that come from the report from
[26:29] them were that they were fine Christian
[26:31] individuals so we pray Lord that you
[26:33] just take care of the family now because
[26:35] of the separation and the grief Lord
[26:37] just be with each one we thank you for
[26:39] all things thank you for your healing
[26:41] power that you've helped each one of us
[26:43] get through Lord certain things to make
[26:45] it here tonight father we pray that the
[26:47] Overcomers will get something because
[26:49] the scripture says he that overcometh
[26:51] we'll receive these promises Lord so the
[26:53] ones that have overcome are sitting here
[26:55] tonight Lord we pray that you just be
[26:57] with each one
[26:58] lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit
[26:59] in Jesus name
[27:02] amen that's what I believe I believe if
[27:04] you come on Wednesday night you've
[27:09] overcome work
[27:12] jobs tired
[27:15] weary whatever you know Sunday's set
[27:17] aside for service most of y'all don't
[27:19] come anyway but Wednesday night is
[27:23] something special but the Bible says he
[27:27] that over cometh it's easy to set home
[27:30] but it's really hard to get up and come
[27:31] to church the devil will make sure that
[27:35] Romans 4:13 for the promise now this is
[27:38] Paul speaking of Abraham for the promise
[27:41] that he should be the heir of the world
[27:43] was not to Abraham or to his seed
[27:46] through the
[27:47] law but through the righteousness of
[27:51] faith for if they which are of the law
[27:54] be HS faith is made void in other words
[27:56] dos and don'ts
[27:58] all right and the promise made of none
[28:00] effect because the law worketh wrath for
[28:03] where no law is there is no
[28:05] transgression therefore it is of faith
[28:08] that it may be by grace to the end the
[28:12] promise might be sure to all the seed
[28:14] not to that only which is of the law but
[28:17] to that which is of the faith of Abraham
[28:20] who is the father of us all I don't have
[28:22] a time for a quote tonight but brother
[28:23] brandham said Abraham is the father of
[28:27] this Nation the United States of America
[28:29] because the Bible says he is a father of
[28:33] Nations amen we're
[28:36] here we're here that's what makes it
[28:38] that right because it's the faith seed
[28:42] who is the father of us all as it is
[28:43] written I have made thee a father of
[28:45] many nations before him whom he believed
[28:48] even God who quickeneth the dead and
[28:50] calleth those things which be not as
[28:52] though they were who against hope
[28:55] believed in hope that he he might become
[28:58] the father of many nations so he had to
[28:59] go through
[29:00] something it just wasn't given to him he
[29:03] had to go through it through the Journey
[29:05] according to that which was spoken so
[29:08] shall thy seed be and being not weak in
[29:11] faith he considered not his own body now
[29:14] dead when he was about a hundred years
[29:16] old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[29:18] womb he staggered not at the promise of
[29:23] God through unbelief but was strong in
[29:25] faith giving glory to God and being
[29:28] fully persuaded that what he had
[29:30] promised he was able to perform and
[29:33] therefore it was imputed or or reckoned
[29:35] or counted to Abraham for righteousness
[29:39] now it is not written for his sake
[29:42] alone it's we're going to bring us in
[29:44] here is not written for his sake alone
[29:47] that was imputed to him but for us also
[29:50] Amen to whom it shall be imputed what
[29:53] this promise if we believe on him that
[29:56] raised up Jesus our lord Lord from the
[29:58] dead so Paul brings it from the Old
[29:59] Testament and brings it to Jesus Christ
[30:02] in the New Testament you may be SE in
[30:03] the Lord I his Blessing to the reading
[30:05] of the word let's go and read quote one
[30:07] from who is this mzc we've read it
[30:09] before several times brother Dale has
[30:11] also but we're going to read it
[30:13] again now God in this stage paragraph 64
[30:19] 65-21 it is this stage of his creation
[30:22] later formed into flesh Jesus now who's
[30:24] he talking about
[30:26] MDC everybody understand that say amen
[30:29] amen from what from the great beginning
[30:32] Spirit then came down to be the word
[30:35] bringing itself out the word doesn't yet
[30:38] make itself it's just spoke out in
[30:40] morphe later he becomes flesh Jesus
[30:43] mortal to taste death for all of us
[30:45] sinners when Abraham met him he was
[30:50] mzc the
[30:52] priest not the Savior but the priest at
[30:55] the end
[30:58] okay he meets him in the beginning but
[30:59] watch he unfolds here what all the
[31:02] attributes will do in the final end now
[31:05] what are you and I we're the attributes
[31:09] amen we'll do in the Final End every son
[31:12] of Abraham every son of the faith will
[31:16] absolutely do the same
[31:20] thing so we can look at Abraham Abram
[31:24] Abraham look and see his journey and you
[31:27] must be able to put yourself in that
[31:29] Journey
[31:31] amen and then he goes on talks about the
[31:33] kinsman redeemer but that's okay right
[31:35] now but every son of the faith so so one
[31:38] we have a mandate to take a body change
[31:40] two we have to go exactly through what
[31:42] Abraham went through because if he's the
[31:45] father of our
[31:47] faith then you are and I are the
[31:49] production of that faith if he's a
[31:54] father amen if he's a father he's got
[31:57] produce
[31:58] something he's got to produce Sons and
[32:00] Daughters of God
[32:02] Amen so
[32:04] now in type we're going to take Abram's
[32:07] Journey just real
[32:09] quick to becoming Abraham because you
[32:12] and I have to go through the same thing
[32:14] and brother Brandon brings it we'll read
[32:16] it in a little while through
[32:18] justification in Genesis
[32:21] 12
[32:23] sanctification Genesis 15 so he goes
[32:26] through a journey for those of you that
[32:27] are that are new Bible readers you ought
[32:29] to read this you ought to go in your
[32:31] Bible and read Genesis 12 through
[32:33] Genesis about 18 or 19 that is Abram's
[32:37] journey to
[32:39] Abraham and that's God speaking to Abram
[32:42] bringing him through a journey of life I
[32:45] mean Abram to me I I don't think Abram
[32:49] woke up one day and God started talking
[32:50] to him and Abram said I'm
[32:53] special
[32:55] right there's billions of of people
[32:57] going to preach about me at 6,000 years
[32:59] from
[33:00] now no he just got up and lived his life
[33:03] amen
[33:05] amen like Jesus he just got up and lived
[33:07] his life but Abram developing into
[33:11] Abraham because the promise was to
[33:13] Abraham all
[33:15] right through justification
[33:18] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[33:20] Ghost and about Genesis 18 somewhere in
[33:22] 17 and then come up to brother brandham
[33:26] I I have a couple of quotes we're going
[33:28] to read where brother B says he goes
[33:30] through justification sanctification
[33:31] baptism and the Holy Ghost
[33:34] placing you got to put the adoption in
[33:36] there placing an
[33:38] air amen you got to go through
[33:41] justification sanctification baptism
[33:42] Holy Ghost to get the new
[33:44] birth you can you you can
[33:47] still mess up do things wrong okay but
[33:52] now you come up a little higher to the
[33:54] placing uh we we were talking about it
[33:56] yet last Sunday when God bursts you into
[33:59] the body it's the same thing he says to
[34:02] Jesus on the River Jordan This is my son
[34:05] or daughter in whom I'm pleased to
[34:08] dwell but not hear ye him right Jesus
[34:12] had to preach and go through three years
[34:14] of a journey yet he was God Almighty
[34:19] himself so what about me and you right
[34:21] we don't just get it all at one time
[34:24] right he had to go through a three-year
[34:26] Journey
[34:28] we can go through a 20-year journey and
[34:30] just be born again but God remember one
[34:32] thing if you're birth into the body of
[34:34] Christ God is pleased to dwell in you
[34:35] for some reason that's why I told him
[34:38] downstairs I said some of you may not
[34:39] like me I really don't
[34:41] care I
[34:43] don't but God saw something about me
[34:46] that he likeed and that's what I'm going
[34:48] for really doesn't matter to me what you
[34:51] think as long as
[34:54] God thinks enough of me to birth me in
[34:56] the body
[34:58] then he thought something of me saw
[35:00] before the foundation of the world
[35:01] there's a character of that man that I
[35:05] like you ought to think that about
[35:07] yourself I'm G to tell you something we
[35:09] got to take this Fear Part out of it I
[35:12] was telling you know we're going to give
[35:13] you a testimony a little bit later on
[35:15] but but Ryan saw the same thing the
[35:17] other day on a on a sign at a church it
[35:19] says take your
[35:21] fear and make it Faith or from Fear to
[35:25] Faith and I'm working on a sermon from
[35:26] from Fear to Faith cuz fear means
[35:31] nothing remember Adam first thing Adam
[35:34] said now listen Adam talked to almighty
[35:36] God he talked to the Creator every day
[35:39] right had no problem at all until the
[35:42] fall happened and what's the first thing
[35:44] Adam said I was
[35:46] afraid where'd that come
[35:49] from come from here it didn't come from
[35:52] here it came from
[35:55] here
[35:58] same way with you and I amen but if
[36:00] you're not born again the fear is
[36:03] here you better fear something right if
[36:06] your Soul's not born again you better
[36:07] fear something cuz those two I I'll
[36:10] guarantee you one thing those four kids
[36:12] that were in that church service they
[36:13] didn't know that was the last day they'd
[36:14] ever see their parents or or another day
[36:19] they were sitting in a church service
[36:20] and they get in an airplane they're
[36:22] gone not trying to scare you into
[36:24] anything but you know what if they
[36:25] weren't born again
[36:33] but what a mighty God we
[36:35] serve that he's
[36:37] able to produce what he said he was
[36:39] going to
[36:40] produce I'm going to have sons and
[36:43] daughters I'm going to have sons and
[36:44] daughters that I'm going to be pleased
[36:46] to dwell
[36:48] in and then some are going to make it to
[36:51] a journey to where now I'm going to say
[36:53] if you're going to hear anything you're
[36:55] going to hear it from those people
[36:56] people right
[36:59] amen cuz there'll be no body change
[37:03] without an
[37:05] adoption amen even with an
[37:08] adoption there wasn't a body change amen
[37:13] so we got to go on we got to see the air
[37:17] I don't know why I'm doing this but it's
[37:18] not in my notes air that air is you got
[37:22] when you're an air you own
[37:25] it it's yours it's not going to be yours
[37:29] oh yeah naturally we have to wait till
[37:33] Daddy and Mama dies our Rich Uncle dies
[37:36] but not with God he he was slain before
[37:39] the foundation of the
[37:40] world our Daddy's done give us all the
[37:43] things that we need then whose problem
[37:45] is
[37:47] it mine right you can put your name in
[37:50] there if you want to but mine but look
[37:52] Abram was a unique
[37:54] man when he went through his
[37:57] Journey we see that Abram the first
[38:00] thing now let's go and turn to Genesis
[38:01] 12 cuz
[38:03] remember your name means
[38:06] something
[38:08] amen the word Abram means High
[38:11] father it doesn't mean a man sitting on
[38:14] a hill it doesn't mean a guy that sits
[38:15] beside the bush it doesn't mean somebody
[38:17] by the
[38:21] Brook then Abram was able to produce
[38:25] something
[38:28] I hope you're getting something
[38:31] here in other words Abram doesn't mean a
[38:34] man riding a horse right then he's
[38:37] changed to a father of many nations
[38:41] no he's high father right which means he
[38:44] can have children right to be a father
[38:48] you got to have kids
[38:50] amen so God's telling
[38:52] Abram even in this part of your journey
[38:55] the very first part of your journey
[38:56] you're going to be able to produce
[39:00] something well I hope you see it like I
[39:02] see it maybe tonight we'll see
[39:06] something but Sarah look at Sarah now
[39:10] watch her name means
[39:14] contentious and boy wasn't
[39:17] she it was her idea
[39:23] right and even God said listen to her
[39:28] right God said listen to
[39:33] her but that contentious
[39:36] spirit is going to be turned to a
[39:38] princess but God couldn't produce the
[39:41] promised child with a contentious
[39:45] nature cuz remember she didn't ever
[39:47] produce anything now Abram did being
[39:50] high father Abram produced something
[39:53] right all
[39:55] right now Genesis
[39:58] 12 look in your Bibles or you can look
[40:00] here if you want to but mine's so
[40:02] written up in notes so I've got a few
[40:04] notes here that I can
[40:06] use so I'm just going to read my Bible
[40:09] and I left my iPad back there but watch
[40:13] God unfold The Plan of Redemption now
[40:15] watch now the Lord had said unto
[40:19] Abram get thee out of thy country and
[40:23] from thy Kindred from thy father's house
[40:24] into a land that I will show thee
[40:27] now look and I
[40:29] will now watch this cuz we're going to
[40:32] come back to this I was telling brother
[40:34] Jo and him in the back and I'll give you
[40:35] a little Point
[40:37] here Abram when he becomes
[40:41] Abraham he's right back at the same
[40:44] spot when he's at when he was
[40:49] Abram the M PLS of
[40:51] mamry we'll read it in a minute he was
[40:54] at mamry
[40:57] went away took his journey come right
[40:59] back to
[41:01] mamry because remember mamry means
[41:04] strength so justification you need
[41:06] strength but you need that same strength
[41:09] over here when you meet mzd all right
[41:11] called Abraham so he called him out he
[41:13] said okay he said
[41:15] sea put your name in there Shaunie
[41:20] sea get out of the
[41:23] land land of Egypt land of the world
[41:26] world separate
[41:28] yourself I'm calling you to do something
[41:31] he called Abram to do something
[41:35] right he knew he was going to become
[41:37] Abraham but Abraham didn't
[41:40] right you know what Abram done he just
[41:44] started to come to church on Wednesday
[41:51] night that's the way the Journey
[41:54] Begins take a Abram put your name in
[41:57] there right start doing something
[42:00] different
[42:03] right because watch verse two Sean this
[42:07] is not you it says I will so God takes
[42:12] over he said I will make you
[42:14] this I will make of thee a great nation
[42:18] and I will bless thee and make thy name
[42:22] great and thou shalt be a
[42:24] blessing and th will bless them that
[42:27] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[42:29] thee in thee shall all families of the
[42:31] earth be blessed right now there's
[42:35] nothing in there about being a prom a
[42:37] promised
[42:40] son
[42:42] nothing because Abram cannot produce the
[42:45] promised
[42:48] son Abram so God's not going to put in
[42:51] there right now but now later on he's
[42:54] going to add a little to it later on in
[42:55] your Journey God's going to add a little
[42:57] something to you all right so Abram
[43:01] departed so he went on I told him we
[43:03] were going to kind of skip around a
[43:04] little
[43:05] bit let's go now to now he goes
[43:08] on and he keeps going on his
[43:11] journey in verse 7 there in chapter 12
[43:15] says unto thy seed will I give this land
[43:17] and there build he an altar of the Lord
[43:20] who appeared unto him and he was there
[43:22] at bethl look at verse n says and Abram
[43:25] journeyed going
[43:27] on Sean it's a journey everybody it's a
[43:30] journey it's a journey we go through all
[43:33] right but now remember there's a lot of
[43:36] thing goes on things go
[43:38] on when Abram is going through his
[43:41] journey so now let's go to chapter
[43:45] 14 but the problem with Abram was he
[43:48] listened to God but he didn't listen all
[43:51] the
[43:54] way same way with you and I listen in
[43:57] justification you can still
[44:00] smoke you can still do some of the
[44:03] things of the world because remember
[44:05] only your past sins have been chopped
[44:07] off God's not going to remember those
[44:09] anymore but the very next day you do the
[44:11] same thing that's where you're going to
[44:14] be judged again if you continue in
[44:17] that amen that's everybody's Journey no
[44:22] exceptions
[44:23] none you're still smoking you're just
[44:26] ified just put yourself in there you're
[44:29] on your way on a journey if you're still
[44:31] doing the things of the world you know
[44:33] what the things of the world is still in
[44:34] you because God just Justified you he
[44:37] just cut your past sins off right he
[44:40] just said
[44:41] hey I'm not going to remember that
[44:44] anymore but tomorrow I'm going to
[44:46] remember it
[44:48] again because you're on a journey all
[44:51] right now in verse in chapter 14
[44:57] excuse me chapter 14 we're still under
[45:02] justification we're still if you want to
[45:04] look at Verse 18 of chapter 13 Abram
[45:08] removed his tent came and dwelt in the
[45:09] plain of
[45:11] mamory which is in heon which is called
[45:14] a seed of Association so see that's
[45:16] where Abram started his journey all
[45:18] right now where does he meet
[45:20] mesd in the plains of mammory through
[45:23] this whole journey he comes right back
[45:24] to the same place
[45:27] in
[45:28] justification because remember the Bible
[45:31] says those who he has Justified he has
[45:35] already
[45:39] glorified all right so you got to come
[45:41] right back to that same Journey listen
[45:43] if brother brandham if we believe he's a
[45:45] prophet which we do absolutely if he
[45:47] said every son of the faith is going to
[45:48] go through this then your journey is
[45:50] going to have to parallel Abraham Abram
[45:53] and Abraham if it doesn't you need to
[45:55] start somewhere and say God I'm
[45:59] leaving I'm leaving something but what
[46:01] did Abram do God said Abram separate
[46:03] yourself well Abram separated himself
[46:06] but he took his little demon with
[46:09] him now I'm not calling lot a demon
[46:11] because he was a righteous man but what
[46:13] happened in type is instead of him
[46:15] shedding all of the world he brought lot
[46:18] with him he brought his family with him
[46:21] God didn't tell him to do that God told
[46:23] him to separate himself that's why you
[46:25] can still do the things of the world you
[46:27] can still smoke cuss and do the things
[46:28] you used to do but you're in a
[46:31] journey okay you're not Sanctified yet
[46:35] you're definitely not full of the Holy
[46:36] Ghost yet because sanctification cleans
[46:38] all that stuff out all right I know we
[46:42] have some new ones here maybe it'll help
[46:43] some of the new ones some of you old
[46:44] ones can sleep through it and listen to
[46:45] the tape later Genesis
[46:47] 14 verse 18 and MDC king of Salem
[46:52] brought forth Bread and Wine and he was
[46:54] the priest of the most high God and he
[46:56] blessed him and said Blessed Be
[47:00] Who
[47:03] Abram even in your journey if you're in
[47:06] a true Justified condition God's blessed
[47:09] you
[47:10] amen amen he's done something that he
[47:14] hasn't done for billions of people in
[47:16] the world he called you and you
[47:20] answered
[47:23] amen gosh you talking about a special
[47:25] group of people right even in
[47:27] justification you're a special group of
[47:29] people he met mcdc in justification
[47:32] right that's the same thing with you and
[47:34] I you got to meet God you can't just say
[47:37] God forgive me of my sins and then never
[47:39] come to church anymore and never do the
[47:40] things you know read your Bible and
[47:42] never study and never pray you didn't
[47:44] get
[47:46] Justified you just like they do you find
[47:48] Jesus in
[47:49] jail you know ain't that a
[47:52] problem Sean you go through life and
[47:54] everything's fine you got a little weed
[47:56] in your in you I don't mean to do that
[47:58] got a little weed in your in your car
[48:00] though and everything's fine and dandy
[48:02] and and then you get stopped by the
[48:04] police and they put you in
[48:07] jail and the and the and the judge says
[48:11] you're going to get 20 years for
[48:15] this Sean goes and gets his
[48:18] Bible and he finds Jesus in
[48:21] jail he starts living better because he
[48:24] got caught
[48:27] one more time because he got
[48:29] caught not because there because
[48:32] remember Godly sorrow leadth to
[48:35] repentance that's our problem the Bible
[48:37] says repent and be baptized in the name
[48:39] of Jesus Christ we've been baptizing
[48:43] people have you
[48:45] repented that's the first thing you got
[48:47] to do before you go to the water you got
[48:48] to
[48:50] repent cuz we took many to the water and
[48:52] they hadn't repented and they're not
[48:53] sitting here tonight what'd that do just
[48:56] got them
[49:00] wet I'll still baptize them brother Dale
[49:02] still baptize them then it's up to
[49:04] you it was up to Abram to get up and go
[49:07] on that Journey now he might have made a
[49:09] hundred million mistakes but at least he
[49:12] was
[49:13] moving at least he was in a
[49:16] journey at least he was doing something
[49:19] that he was supposed to be doing amen
[49:23] cuz remember when when God started this
[49:25] whole program with Abram he didn't tell
[49:27] him now now Abram you're going to be
[49:29] changed to Abraham you're going to be
[49:31] this and you're going to
[49:32] have he didn't tell him that right he
[49:35] just said I'm going to bless you right
[49:38] I'm going to bless the land that you're
[49:40] in and right here mzc said he blessed
[49:42] him he said Blessed Be Abram of the most
[49:44] high god possessor of Heaven and Earth
[49:47] and blessed be the most high God which
[49:49] hath delivered thine enemies into thy
[49:51] hands and he gave them tithes of
[49:54] all
[49:56] that's pretty good
[49:57] fell at least God met
[50:00] him in his Justified condition
[50:04] right but now did Abram
[50:07] quit now look at chapter 15 just keep
[50:10] rolling up chapter 15 verse one after
[50:13] these
[50:15] things come on after the journey that
[50:18] you're taking after the things that
[50:20] you're doing that are
[50:22] correct see like I said about finding
[50:24] Jesus in jail see people find Jesus in
[50:26] jail and then they'll come to church for
[50:28] about 3 or 4 months every service this
[50:31] is the greatest thing since SP sliced
[50:33] bread never heard anything like this
[50:36] before now listen to me I'm talking to
[50:38] some of you then you stop coming on
[50:41] Wednesday
[50:43] night then you stop coming on Sunday
[50:46] afternoon then you just start coming
[50:48] once a month you know what you on your
[50:51] way
[50:53] out that was the Jesus in jail part
[50:56] and you know what it's okay I'm not I'm
[50:58] not being critical of that but I've seen
[51:01] too many people do that you remember the
[51:03] long haired people they'll cut their
[51:04] hair short they'll hide their tattoos to
[51:06] go before the
[51:07] judge to what make an impression that
[51:10] they've made a
[51:12] change still got it on under them it's
[51:15] still
[51:19] there but that's what Satan
[51:22] does he'll feel Satan's spiritual he
[51:25] more spiritual than we are people right
[51:28] he feels that move of God towards you
[51:30] and he'll beat God there most every
[51:32] time cuz you let
[51:34] him cuz you let
[51:37] him well I can't get to church on Sunday
[51:39] afternoon now because XYZ well what
[51:42] happened to that three months ago that
[51:43] this is the greatest thing since sliced
[51:44] bread and I've never seen anything like
[51:46] this never heard anything like this this
[51:47] is the greatest preacher ever heard in
[51:48] my life I've heard it a thousand times
[51:51] and those people are not sitting here
[51:54] tonight now Abram didn't do that AB what
[51:57] my Pro my whole thing is Abram didn't
[51:59] start this journey and then about the
[52:01] middle he says I'm
[52:04] done I'm
[52:06] done
[52:08] I'm God you can talk to me all you want
[52:10] to but I'm done no Abram keep reading
[52:13] that's what I mean read Genesis 12 13 14
[52:16] 15 16 17 and 18 put yourself in this
[52:19] man's shoes because this is all the sons
[52:22] of the faith Journey right chapter 15
[52:26] after these things the word of the Lord
[52:29] capital L day so that's God
[52:32] himself came unto Abram in a vision
[52:35] saying fear
[52:39] not there's that word
[52:42] fear fear not Abram fear not
[52:46] Abram hadn't called him Abraham yet
[52:48] God's perfect had called him Abraham yet
[52:52] he's Abram fear not Abram
[52:56] I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[53:00] reward and look at verse two and Abram
[53:04] said Lord God now he's talking to the
[53:06] one
[53:08] inside Lord God bring it down now
[53:11] Abraham didn't have the new birth but
[53:13] God was speaking to him right in his
[53:16] senses all right Lord God what will thou
[53:19] give me seeing I go
[53:23] childless now God he knew his name was
[53:26] Abram he knew he was a high father but
[53:28] he hadn't told him about producing a
[53:30] child he hadn't told him he he had said
[53:32] you'll be a father of Nations
[53:34] yet
[53:36] okay in other words some of you young
[53:40] ones God's not going to pour this thing
[53:41] on you because he knows as human beings
[53:44] we cannot take it all at one
[53:47] time that's why Abram started and he
[53:49] said just
[53:51] separate just separate yourself just
[53:53] just get out go on a journey come go
[53:56] walk with me for a little while get
[53:59] around some Believers cuz remember Abram
[54:01] went to Egypt which is the type of the
[54:03] world that was his problem right he come
[54:07] back out and got into Canan and got to
[54:09] feeling better CU Canan land is where we
[54:12] are Glory so he got around a bunch of
[54:14] Believers right why in the world would
[54:18] you want to go around unbelievers right
[54:21] especially in your journey when you're
[54:23] real
[54:24] soft and very impressionable why would
[54:27] you do that
[54:30] listen I've Got Friends of
[54:33] old that knew me of
[54:37] old and they put through they put me
[54:39] through a couple of
[54:41] tests and thank God through God's grace
[54:43] I passed them so you know what that was
[54:46] the
[54:47] separator I didn't have to go up to them
[54:49] and say I ain't dealing with you guys no
[54:51] more y'all drink smoke cuss run around
[54:53] women all this time I'm not dealing with
[54:54] y'all anymore now no I never said that
[54:56] did I Jun I never totally just sat down
[54:59] with my friends and said I'm not dealing
[55:01] with you guys
[55:02] anymore no they would want to go hunting
[55:04] they'd say well we're going to drive
[55:06] would you ride with us well I knew that
[55:08] meant I wasn't coming back till Sunday
[55:11] afternoon see there's the test I said no
[55:14] I'll drive and I'll come back Saturday
[55:16] night so they saw that Journey same way
[55:20] with Abram they saw Abram's Journey
[55:22] Don't you think it wasn't people
[55:24] watching
[55:25] there's people watching you so in that
[55:28] Journey you got Abram coming up through
[55:30] there and
[55:32] remember Paul says Abraham staggered not
[55:35] at the promise of God through unbelief
[55:36] but remember at one time that man was
[55:39] Abram he had to believe there had to be
[55:43] a faith come all the way through that
[55:45] Journey it wasn't that just Abraham got
[55:47] faith at the Final End
[55:50] right same way with you and
[55:53] I we got got to have faith that this
[55:56] thing will take us through
[55:58] amen and not us
[56:02] right what a mighty God we
[56:05] serve Genesis 15 where was I 15 2 and6
[56:09] we're reading it here and Abraham said
[56:11] Lord God what will thou give me seeing I
[56:14] go childless and the steward of my house
[56:16] which is elzar of Damascus is the elezar
[56:19] of
[56:20] Damascus and Abram said behold to me
[56:23] thou Hast given no seed
[56:26] and lo one born in my house is my air
[56:29] and behold the word of the Lord came and
[56:31] saying this shall not be your Heir
[56:36] right now
[56:38] remember I don't know about your journey
[56:41] but in my journey I took a lot of
[56:49] Correction me and Hanks the only two
[56:51] that's went through this whole
[56:53] thing
[56:56] one more time thank you all
[57:01] right to me thou Hast given no seed he's
[57:04] what Abram is in a pity
[57:06] party like we do a lot of the times
[57:09] Abram said God You' not given me
[57:11] anything I'm just out here by myself and
[57:13] you've given me no I ain't even got
[57:15] nothing to go on God said shut
[57:19] up verse four says and behold the word
[57:21] of the Lord came unto him saying this
[57:23] shall not be thine
[57:27] right but he that shall come forth out
[57:30] of thine own bowel so now Abram knows
[57:33] he's going to produce
[57:35] something got it everybody with me say
[57:38] Amen Abram is going to produce something
[57:43] okay out of thine own bow shall be thine
[57:48] air and he brought him forth the broad
[57:50] and said look now toward the heaven and
[57:51] tell the Stars if thou be able to number
[57:53] them and he said unto them so shall thy
[57:55] seed be right and he believed not on the
[58:00] Lord in the Lord right in other words he
[58:04] was in that Dome or that Spear of Faith
[58:07] where he just said hey God watch what he
[58:09] says right here and he believed in the
[58:11] Lord and he counted it to him for
[58:13] righteousness God counted it or imputed
[58:15] unto him for righteousness because he
[58:17] believed right now your journey is going
[58:20] to be the same
[58:21] way all right everybody okay say Amen
[58:24] amen all right and he believed in the
[58:27] Lord and he counted him for
[58:29] righteousness for he said unto him I am
[58:30] the Lord that brought thee out of Earth
[58:33] that child to give thee this land Abram
[58:35] would have still been in the earth child
[58:37] he was fine where he was at my world was
[58:40] wonderful where I was
[58:42] at wasn't
[58:46] yours I went where I wanted to thought
[58:48] what I wanted to did what I wanted
[58:51] to didn't care a thing about church
[58:59] but something
[59:00] happened something happened to
[59:02] Abram God's telling him say look buddy
[59:06] it wasn't you right it was
[59:09] me remember he said I will I will I will
[59:13] I
[59:18] will watch
[59:23] this
[59:25] then Abram asked a
[59:28] question and he said' Lord God whereby
[59:31] shall I
[59:32] know that I shall inherit
[59:35] it now we're not going to go through it
[59:37] but read it and and listen to The
[59:39] Prophet's message go get Abraham's
[59:41] Covenant confirmed and several others
[59:43] brother Dale's preached on it maybe
[59:44] about six or seven years ago and I think
[59:47] I did it maybe a few years ago where we
[59:49] took every scripture and went down
[59:50] through Abraham's Journey or Abram's
[59:52] Journey um because you take takes
[59:55] sacrifices and he breaks them apart and
[59:57] he stands between them and all those
[59:58] things it's all meaning a type of our
[1:00:01] sacrifice to God because remember he's
[1:00:04] heading towards
[1:00:06] sanctification because remember in
[1:00:09] sanctification sanctification means
[1:00:12] cleaned and set aside for service not
[1:00:16] put in service remember Abram is not
[1:00:18] going to be put into service right cuz
[1:00:21] Abram's in God's mind Abram's
[1:00:26] sole being of of of existence is to have
[1:00:32] Isaac Abram just doesn't know
[1:00:35] that same way with you and I it's what I
[1:00:37] said about when we at the beginning at
[1:00:38] the beginning we got a mandate and God
[1:00:41] knows who's going to finish this thing
[1:00:42] up but you and I don't so we have to go
[1:00:45] through the
[1:00:45] Journey but if we can type that Journey
[1:00:48] with somebody in the
[1:00:51] Bible which is the final resting place
[1:00:53] of our faith should be in
[1:00:55] Scripture that we find a man that went
[1:00:58] through everything that me and you are
[1:01:00] going
[1:01:01] through just make it
[1:01:04] modern cuz remember we don't do
[1:01:06] sacrifices anymore but you know what we
[1:01:07] give our body a Living Sacrifice you
[1:01:09] read in Paul's scripture where we give
[1:01:11] our body a Living Sacrifice we we
[1:01:14] sacrifice this thing we don't it does in
[1:01:17] sanctification it does come to the dos
[1:01:19] and
[1:01:21] don'ts okay cuz you're not born again
[1:01:23] yet right
[1:01:25] sanctification the unclean Spirit goes
[1:01:27] out of a man right the smoking the
[1:01:31] drinking all that goes away right you
[1:01:33] don't do that anymore that's in
[1:01:35] sanctification that's not when you get
[1:01:37] that's not when you become a
[1:01:40] Christian cuz remember we believe that
[1:01:42] when you're a Christian you're born
[1:01:43] again all right Born Again Believers in
[1:01:47] this ma in this in this church are born
[1:01:50] again they have God living in their soul
[1:01:52] they don't do them things anymore okay
[1:01:54] because that sanctification is where
[1:01:56] those things have to go out because
[1:01:58] remember sanctification is cleaned just
[1:02:01] like Sean if you took a glass you okay
[1:02:03] if I use ear up here close I fig I
[1:02:06] figured it was okay good to see you man
[1:02:07] I love that smiling face but you take a
[1:02:10] glass if you picked up the glass down at
[1:02:12] the car lot don't ever pick up a glass
[1:02:13] at the car lot but if you picked up a
[1:02:15] glass at that car lot but you know what
[1:02:18] that you know what God didn't care where
[1:02:19] that glass came
[1:02:21] from it could have come from a sewer of
[1:02:23] sewers
[1:02:24] right God picks that glass up Sean and
[1:02:27] he says I'm not going to drink out of it
[1:02:29] but I got it for a
[1:02:31] reason
[1:02:32] amen justification I picked the glass up
[1:02:36] that glass can be used to drink real
[1:02:40] good clear
[1:02:43] water but you don't want to do that with
[1:02:45] all that dirty stuff in
[1:02:47] it that's justification you're still
[1:02:50] dirty inside you still want to do the
[1:02:52] things of the world you still have that
[1:02:53] desire
[1:02:56] but now when God takes that
[1:02:58] glass and washes it with the water of
[1:03:01] the
[1:03:02] word we come to church we do the things
[1:03:05] right we Fellowship we get around good
[1:03:07] Believers we quit doing the things we're
[1:03:09] doing because what God he's cleaning it
[1:03:12] and setting it aside to put it into
[1:03:14] service not into service yet he's not
[1:03:16] going to drink out of it yet he's got to
[1:03:18] clean it up first cuz remember God will
[1:03:21] not dwell in an unclean vessel right
[1:03:24] right so if you're in justification
[1:03:25] God's not in your
[1:03:27] soul if you're in sanctification God's
[1:03:30] not in your soul exactly you're not a
[1:03:32] Christian right you shouldn't be taking
[1:03:35] foot washing you shouldn't be taking uh
[1:03:37] communion or anything like that unless
[1:03:39] you're born again now that's what the
[1:03:41] prophet of God said right am I okay
[1:03:43] that's what he said he said you got to
[1:03:45] be born again to take communion you got
[1:03:46] to be born again to do these things foot
[1:03:48] washing and all those things amen now
[1:03:51] you can head toward that right that's
[1:03:53] okay right right but don't just come in
[1:03:55] here and take communion just because
[1:03:57] everybody else does because remember the
[1:03:58] scripture says you're eating and
[1:04:00] drinking damnation until yourself if
[1:04:02] you're not in the position to be able to
[1:04:04] take that's a serious thing that's not
[1:04:06] just drinking wine and eating a piece of
[1:04:09] bread that's a commission you know what
[1:04:12] it's saying when I take that wine and I
[1:04:14] take that and that I take that bread
[1:04:16] that I'm clean right that I'm clean and
[1:04:20] I'm in service for God not putting me in
[1:04:23] service but I already in service for God
[1:04:26] so you take the bottle Sean and you
[1:04:27] clean the thing up God cleans you up
[1:04:29] puts you up on a shelf and says I'm
[1:04:30] going to use this guy for something I'm
[1:04:33] going to use this glass for something
[1:04:35] right but I don't know yet what I'm
[1:04:37] going to use it for now God does but you
[1:04:38] don't right if I don't get finished with
[1:04:41] this sermon is that okay we're just
[1:04:42] going to talk to the young people
[1:04:44] tonight okay young in
[1:04:46] God but he takes that glass and he puts
[1:04:49] it up it's
[1:04:52] clean you can drink out of it but God's
[1:04:55] not ready to fill it up with anything
[1:04:58] yet amen all right same way with Abram's
[1:05:01] Journey Abram was okay in justification
[1:05:04] he was called high father so he could
[1:05:06] produce something well Abram is still in
[1:05:08] sanctification and he's walking with God
[1:05:10] he's meeting God he meets God himself
[1:05:14] right MDC is God in human flesh no other
[1:05:18] so he meets God well you know where you
[1:05:20] meet God now I'm going to read you a
[1:05:22] quote in a few minutes it may just blow
[1:05:24] you
[1:05:27] backwards cuz we don't look at one man
[1:05:31] now sure we have a pastor we have
[1:05:33] assistant pastor we have a Deacon's
[1:05:34] Elders we have five-fold
[1:05:36] Ministry but God said
[1:05:39] MDC was God in human
[1:05:41] flesh he said now we eat a calf we drink
[1:05:48] Mel
[1:05:49] mezic in this group of people not one
[1:05:53] person anymore
[1:05:57] Right add don't to make a Baptist
[1:06:04] SH now
[1:06:06] look let's go to chapter 16 and we're
[1:06:08] not going to get finished now Sarah now
[1:06:11] remember she's contentious woman Sarah
[1:06:13] means
[1:06:14] contentious now Sarah Abram's wife bear
[1:06:17] him no children and she had a handmade
[1:06:19] an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and
[1:06:22] Sarah said unto ABR behold now the Lord
[1:06:26] capital l d hath restrained me from
[1:06:29] bearing all right I pray thee go into my
[1:06:32] maid it may be that I may obtain
[1:06:35] children by her and Abram hearkened to
[1:06:37] the voice of
[1:06:40] Sarah so what did they
[1:06:43] do
[1:06:44] Sarah was the same as
[1:06:47] Eve she wanted to produce her own
[1:06:52] program all right Abram Abram sitting
[1:06:55] there he can
[1:06:57] produce right he does doesn't he he does
[1:07:01] doesn't he
[1:07:02] right I mean I mean look let me give you
[1:07:05] a little for those you that that are
[1:07:06] young Abram and Sarah were first cousins
[1:07:10] but now that's okay back in the Old
[1:07:11] Testament because they were from
[1:07:13] different fathers or mothers everybody
[1:07:15] understand that say Amen okay so they
[1:07:17] could have children but they had been
[1:07:19] having relations since they were just a
[1:07:21] a
[1:07:21] teenagers here they are almost 100 years
[1:07:24] or 75 years old and they've not produced
[1:07:27] a child so they've had relations all
[1:07:29] this time somebody was Barren right
[1:07:33] wasn't
[1:07:34] Abram it was Sarah the contentious one
[1:07:38] she couldn't bear cuz it says right
[1:07:41] here Sarah said behold the Lord has
[1:07:43] restrained me from bearing and Sarah
[1:07:46] Abram's wife took Hagar now you can do
[1:07:48] that in the Old Testament we don't do
[1:07:50] that in in the New Testament we don't
[1:07:53] take handmade and concubines and married
[1:07:56] two or three women if you can handle two
[1:07:58] or three go ahead one's enough for
[1:08:01] me and am men say amen that's what I
[1:08:05] thought once enough ain't it
[1:08:08] Johnny yeah buddy once enough all right
[1:08:11] so anyway so now watch here is still
[1:08:14] Abram's Journey God's still with him
[1:08:16] because he produces a
[1:08:20] child amen it may be ish y'all may say
[1:08:24] he's a wild child but I'm going to read
[1:08:25] you in a minute where God blessed that
[1:08:29] boy God said I'll make Nations out of
[1:08:32] you right now sure they might be
[1:08:34] fighting but
[1:08:36] still it was a promise God gave the boy
[1:08:40] remember he was almost dying there at
[1:08:41] one time you know Hagar put him under a
[1:08:44] tree or something and he was just going
[1:08:45] to die an angel of God that's right not
[1:08:49] an angel the devil an angel of God came
[1:08:53] and said I'm going to bless that boy
[1:08:54] he's not going to die we'll read it in
[1:08:56] just a
[1:08:58] second this is what I'm saying in our
[1:09:01] journey God in Abram's Journey God
[1:09:04] blessed
[1:09:05] Abram Abram messed the program up right
[1:09:09] exactly Sarah the contentious one messed
[1:09:12] the program up just like Eve messed the
[1:09:15] program up she was supposed to bring
[1:09:17] forth God's
[1:09:19] children but Satan got to her first
[1:09:22] right same thing with Sarah Sarah says
[1:09:24] hey I'm Baron I can't produce anything
[1:09:26] but here's
[1:09:27] Hagar have a child by her so Abram did
[1:09:30] what she
[1:09:32] said and had a child now
[1:09:36] look watch where the contentious one
[1:09:38] comes
[1:09:39] in and he went into Hagar verse four she
[1:09:42] conceived and when she saw that she had
[1:09:45] conceived her mistress was despised in
[1:09:47] her eyes so Sarah is the one that says
[1:09:51] hey have the child through have a child
[1:09:54] through Hagar once Hagar gets pregnant
[1:09:57] Sarah
[1:09:58] says I shouldn't have done
[1:10:02] that and I want you out of my house now
[1:10:05] wait a minute Sarah is the one that put
[1:10:06] her in that
[1:10:07] place but here's the contentious
[1:10:10] Sarah that would be contentious don't
[1:10:12] you
[1:10:13] think but look Sarah said unto Abraham
[1:10:16] verse 5 my wrong be upon
[1:10:22] thee
[1:10:25] gee I love you women but my you can be
[1:10:27] contentious it
[1:10:31] sometimes know what the Bible says Sarah
[1:10:33] I said unto Abraham my wrong be upon
[1:10:36] thee I have given my maid into thy but
[1:10:39] and other words she's breaking Abram
[1:10:41] down for having to think she was going
[1:10:43] to she's the one that told her to go in
[1:10:46] there when she saw that she had
[1:10:48] conceived I was despised in her eyes and
[1:10:50] the Lord judged between me and thee and
[1:10:53] but Abram said unto Sarah Behold thy
[1:10:55] maid is in thy hand do to her as it
[1:10:57] pleaseth thee and when Sarah dealt
[1:10:59] hardly with her she fled from her face
[1:11:02] now look at verse 7 and the angel of the
[1:11:04] Lord capital L O R D so that's an angel
[1:11:06] straight from God Amen found her by a
[1:11:10] fountain of water in the wilderness by
[1:11:12] the fountain in the way of Sher and said
[1:11:14] Hagar Sarah's maid when cometh thou and
[1:11:17] whether wi thou go and she said I flee
[1:11:19] from the face of my mistress Sarah and
[1:11:21] the angel of the Lord said unto her
[1:11:22] return to mistress and submit thyself
[1:11:26] under her hand and the angel of the Lord
[1:11:28] said unto her I will multiply thy seed
[1:11:32] exceedingly right that it shall not be
[1:11:35] numbered for
[1:11:38] multitude and the angel of the Lord said
[1:11:40] unto her behold thou art with child and
[1:11:43] shalt bear a son and shall call his name
[1:11:45] ishmail
[1:11:48] right because the Lord hath heard thy
[1:11:51] Affliction the Angels tells what what to
[1:11:53] name that child and ishma doesn't really
[1:11:57] he is a wild child but ishmail means God
[1:11:59] shall
[1:12:01] hear what am I
[1:12:03] saying in sanctification God's right
[1:12:06] there with you
[1:12:09] right he was right there with Abram he
[1:12:12] was right there with that whole
[1:12:13] situation that went on God was right
[1:12:15] there angel of God comes and it looks
[1:12:17] like they just messed the whole program
[1:12:18] up and he says no he said I tell you
[1:12:20] what I'm going to do he said I'm just
[1:12:21] going to bless this child too right
[1:12:24] now listen he's not the promised
[1:12:29] child just me and you
[1:12:32] right now we can go home now we can go
[1:12:36] home Ishmael is not me and you ishma is
[1:12:41] our journey and if we continue and live
[1:12:43] a Christian Life and die and go by the
[1:12:46] grave that's okay but there's a mandate
[1:12:50] from God of one promised child one son
[1:12:53] take thy son thy only son now ishmail
[1:12:56] was Abram's son now remember if I was
[1:12:59] looking at at Abram it
[1:13:02] Dad now from a world from from say his
[1:13:06] uncles or
[1:13:07] aunts he looks the same as he did when
[1:13:09] he was Abram now that he's
[1:13:13] Abraham everybody understand where I'm
[1:13:15] going here same way with you and I this
[1:13:18] is the same way Dale that hold the beer
[1:13:20] in the can and right here in my hand and
[1:13:22] spoke dirty things out of this
[1:13:24] mouth just as bad as any of you right
[1:13:28] but this body's the
[1:13:31] same Abram's still here in body
[1:13:35] form but when it moved to Abraham there
[1:13:37] was a promise given right that was a
[1:13:40] promise giv of a body
[1:13:43] change yeah what I want you to see is
[1:13:45] what I saw too is is everybody wants to
[1:13:47] do away with Abram do away with ishel
[1:13:50] you want to do that again she's back
[1:13:52] there doing the same thing I'm doing Ula
[1:13:54] you want to
[1:13:57] preach but people want to do away with
[1:13:59] all that's part of the journey that's
[1:14:02] part of your journey right in
[1:14:04] sanctification you can still be a wild
[1:14:06] child
[1:14:11] right Pentecost was a wild child
[1:14:15] amen but they were born again God gave
[1:14:18] him a promise right just like he gave
[1:14:20] him a promise just then I'm give you a
[1:14:23] son and shall call his name ishel
[1:14:25] because the Lord ha heard thy Affliction
[1:14:26] he will be a wild man his hand will be
[1:14:28] against every man and every man's hand
[1:14:29] against him and he shall dwell in the
[1:14:31] presence of all his Brethren right in
[1:14:34] other words not
[1:14:39] separated my whole point
[1:14:42] is don't throw away Abram right but
[1:14:45] don't stay Abram
[1:14:47] right Abram didn't stay
[1:14:51] Abram Abram's okay
[1:14:54] Abram takes you through the church
[1:14:57] ages
[1:14:59] amen but
[1:15:01] Abram can't get you to a body change God
[1:15:07] has to come on the scene and change you
[1:15:09] right to Abraham to receive a
[1:15:13] promise which is not just to live a good
[1:15:16] Christian life not just to come to
[1:15:18] church every
[1:15:20] Sunday I sound contradictory when we say
[1:15:22] that don't
[1:15:24] but if you don't come to church that's
[1:15:25] one thing for sure you're not you're not
[1:15:27] in the Bible all right so so there is a
[1:15:30] comparison there but it is not all that
[1:15:33] it's that God has G us a promise GL a
[1:15:37] promised son we were reading in Psalms
[1:15:40] the other day where it says this man
[1:15:42] shall be born in you not a baby a man
[1:15:45] shall be born in Zion remember we were
[1:15:47] reading that Sunday school class A man
[1:15:49] shall be born in Zion we're not going to
[1:15:51] birth a baby in the end time
[1:15:55] we're birthing a grown
[1:15:57] man a mature man somebody knows what
[1:16:00] he's
[1:16:01] doing Abram didn't know what he was
[1:16:03] doing he was just sitting there going
[1:16:04] Sarah Sarah you just tell me what to do
[1:16:06] and I'll do it well that's okay you just
[1:16:07] handle her and I'll just go about my
[1:16:09] business but buddy when it comes to
[1:16:13] Abraham I'll show you in a few minutes
[1:16:15] when it comes to Abraham you watch that
[1:16:16] Journey
[1:16:18] come right and Abraham was like a laser
[1:16:21] beam he knew what he wanted
[1:16:24] and he knew what had to happen cuz he
[1:16:25] said God I can't do it cuz see remember
[1:16:28] right here is Abram a lot of times we
[1:16:31] think we can do it and you know what we
[1:16:32] do and mess up cuz he could produce a
[1:16:36] child but not the promised child cuz God
[1:16:40] says take Isaac thine only son now
[1:16:44] remember if the aunts and uncles come to
[1:16:46] a family reunion they're going to say
[1:16:48] Ishmael and Isaac are the sons
[1:16:51] of right
[1:16:55] but they weren't one was the son of
[1:16:57] Abram and one was the son of
[1:16:59] Abraham a promise from God that's what
[1:17:02] I'm talking about not an Earthly promise
[1:17:03] I'm talking about a promise from
[1:17:06] god let's get through this let's hurry
[1:17:11] Genesis now let's
[1:17:13] go now remember Abram Abram did I mean
[1:17:16] Hagar bear Abram a son and Abram called
[1:17:18] his son's name which Hagar bear
[1:17:21] ishma and he was was 86 years old when
[1:17:24] Hagar bear ishmel to Abram so he was
[1:17:27] still able to produce he was high father
[1:17:30] he had a kid so he produced that promise
[1:17:33] and justification you do you produce a
[1:17:36] promise of God God promises you if
[1:17:37] you'll get up and walk away from the
[1:17:39] world I'm going to bless you then is in
[1:17:43] sanctification that glass is still
[1:17:45] sitting on the shelf Sean God is just
[1:17:47] saying all right I got to find a place
[1:17:48] to put this
[1:17:50] guy he's
[1:17:52] clean he's doing the things he's
[1:17:54] supposed to do but I hadn't put him in
[1:17:57] service
[1:17:58] yet all
[1:18:00] right now watch this
[1:18:03] though let's go to chapter
[1:18:06] 17 now remember this is where Abram is
[1:18:11] circumcised and he gets a name change in
[1:18:15] chapter 17 so this is the chapter that
[1:18:18] shows the new birth and you and I
[1:18:21] because for the for those of you that
[1:18:23] hadn't read Bible
[1:18:24] much circumcision was obviously you men
[1:18:28] know what circumcision is they cut off
[1:18:30] the foreskin of your of your member and
[1:18:33] throw it away well that means you're
[1:18:34] circumcised well see in the end in the
[1:18:37] at this time God had to give a sign a
[1:18:40] natural
[1:18:42] sign a natural sign to Abraham Abram he
[1:18:46] gave a natural sign
[1:18:48] right in other words you could show it
[1:18:53] right the excess part of your skin was
[1:18:56] taken off the the world this is the
[1:19:00] world so in circumcision when Abram
[1:19:03] listen Abram was 90 years old 99 years
[1:19:06] old when he circumcised
[1:19:07] himself so there's a there there's
[1:19:10] something goes with that right you don't
[1:19:13] walk the way you used to walk
[1:19:18] righten
[1:19:20] naturally but you got to put that to the
[1:19:22] spirit spiritual right cuz remember when
[1:19:25] God comes and gives you the new birth
[1:19:27] the forkin of yourself of the world is
[1:19:29] gone right and you don't put it back
[1:19:33] it's gone done away with in the sea of
[1:19:36] God's forgetfulness never to be
[1:19:38] remembered again Abram was 90 years old
[1:19:40] and nine and the Lord Capital lrd
[1:19:42] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[1:19:45] the almighty God walk before me and be
[1:19:47] thou perfect that's Abram
[1:19:51] right that's not Abraham
[1:19:56] yet and I will make my Covenant now here
[1:19:59] it
[1:20:00] comes I will make my Covenant between me
[1:20:02] and thee and will multiply thee
[1:20:05] exceedingly Abraham fell on his face and
[1:20:07] God talked with him saying as for me
[1:20:09] behold my Covenant is with thee now here
[1:20:12] he's making a covenant with this man in
[1:20:14] front of him that's the same way with
[1:20:16] the new birth this is my beloved Son in
[1:20:19] whom I'm pleased to dwell you have come
[1:20:21] through a journey sh now he reaches and
[1:20:23] gets that glass and said okay I'm going
[1:20:25] to fill it with the Holy
[1:20:28] Ghost and I'm going to put it in service
[1:20:30] because you know if you set it up you
[1:20:32] put a glass on a shelf and it's not full
[1:20:34] of anything what good is
[1:20:38] it do what collect greas yeah collect G
[1:20:42] and dust if you leave it there long
[1:20:45] enough cuz remember the Bible says the
[1:20:47] unclean Spirit goes out of a man but if
[1:20:50] you don't fill it with something guess
[1:20:51] what that Demon's going to come back
[1:20:52] back with seven other worse than him and
[1:20:54] they're going to try to they're going to
[1:20:55] fill that glass with something you'll
[1:20:58] get
[1:21:00] religious you'll get
[1:21:02] religious but if you'll take that and
[1:21:04] God says hey I've got this thing clean
[1:21:06] now I'm going to fill it full of water
[1:21:07] so that others can drink from
[1:21:10] it now Sister Gil they couldn't drink
[1:21:12] from it when it was empty there was
[1:21:14] nothing in it right but when God takes
[1:21:17] it off the shelf and he fills it full of
[1:21:18] water you know what when God FS
[1:21:20] something full of
[1:21:21] water
[1:21:23] have you ever noticed it never goes
[1:21:26] dry you just keep drinking it keeps
[1:21:28] filling up you keep drinking it keeps
[1:21:29] filling up that's God that's the same
[1:21:33] way with you with the Holy Ghost others
[1:21:35] drink from you then others drink what
[1:21:38] you have it's like brother Dell said he
[1:21:41] said that's the only thing he's ever had
[1:21:42] a possession that you can't buy with
[1:21:45] money but you want to give it away every
[1:21:47] time you as soon as you get
[1:21:51] it
[1:21:54] watch this neither shall thy name
[1:21:56] anymore verse five be called Abram but
[1:21:59] thy name shall be
[1:22:01] Abraham for a father of many nations
[1:22:04] have I made thee now here's the
[1:22:08] program he's telling him exactly now
[1:22:10] you're going to be a father of many
[1:22:17] nations verse six is the
[1:22:20] same as Genesis 12 vers vers
[1:22:23] two I will remember we read it in
[1:22:27] Genesis 12 when he first started his
[1:22:28] journey in justification God said I will
[1:22:31] God said I will look how many times I've
[1:22:33] read this thing look my Bible's about
[1:22:34] broke apart verse two says I will make
[1:22:37] thee a great nation I Will Bless Thee I
[1:22:39] will bless them that bless thee and
[1:22:41] curse them that curse thee now let's go
[1:22:43] back over here now he's coming up in
[1:22:44] from justification to sanctification the
[1:22:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I will
[1:22:48] make thee exceedingly
[1:22:50] fruitful I will make nations of thee so
[1:22:54] obviously he's going to have to have
[1:22:55] some
[1:22:58] children and I will make nations of thee
[1:23:00] and Kings shall come out of thee Kings
[1:23:03] and
[1:23:05] Priests and I will establish my Covenant
[1:23:08] between me and thee and thy seed after
[1:23:11] thee and their generations for an
[1:23:12] Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[1:23:15] thee and to thy seed after thee watch
[1:23:17] how God's bringing it together and I
[1:23:19] will give unto thee and to thy seed
[1:23:21] after thee the
[1:23:24] land wherein thou art a
[1:23:28] stranger this is
[1:23:31] strange this is
[1:23:34] strange this is a Strange Land this
[1:23:37] won't inherit the Kingdom that's right
[1:23:40] amen wherein thou art a stranger all the
[1:23:44] land of Canaan for an everlasting
[1:23:46] possession and I will be their God look
[1:23:51] how confident verse 10
[1:23:53] this is my Covenant which you shall keep
[1:23:55] between me and you and thy seed after
[1:23:57] thee every man child among you shall be
[1:24:00] circumcised all right so we go through
[1:24:02] that and we see the
[1:24:03] circumcision versus
[1:24:05] uncircumcision uncircumcision means you
[1:24:08] still got part of the world and God
[1:24:09] can't use you God can't make you walk
[1:24:12] different he can't do the things that he
[1:24:14] can do because you still got a lot of
[1:24:15] excess skin flesh worldly stuff all
[1:24:18] right everybody understand everybody
[1:24:20] gets the type I know most of you do but
[1:24:21] we got some new ones here and they need
[1:24:23] to understand this cuz look if every son
[1:24:25] of the faith has got to go through this
[1:24:26] journey you got to put yourself in this
[1:24:28] right here you got to put your name in
[1:24:31] this journey right here and take that
[1:24:33] same identical journey in type you
[1:24:36] understand me in type so you got to see
[1:24:38] your types you got to see your types and
[1:24:40] your shadows in the scripture and the
[1:24:42] only way to do that is to come to church
[1:24:44] and
[1:24:46] listen CU somebody will tell you
[1:24:48] something and God sent un to Abraham
[1:24:53] now he's not Abram anymore he's
[1:24:57] Abraham and God sent un Abraham as for
[1:25:00] Sarah contentious one thy wife Thou
[1:25:04] shalt not call her name Sarah but
[1:25:09] Sarah shall be her name shall her name
[1:25:12] be now Sarah means
[1:25:15] princess that sounds a lot better than
[1:25:19] contentious let me marry a princess
[1:25:23] not a contentious woman yeah and I
[1:25:28] did absolutely and I will bless her and
[1:25:32] give her and give thee a son also of her
[1:25:36] now here God has said look he's finally
[1:25:38] said who he's going to give the sun
[1:25:40] through okay see that's what I mean
[1:25:43] about in your journey you read the word
[1:25:45] of God and you don't really get a lot is
[1:25:46] that all right you don't really get a
[1:25:48] lot you just believe you believe in God
[1:25:51] you believe that people people can help
[1:25:52] you but there's a time when you come to
[1:25:54] a new birth where you got to have a
[1:25:55] relationship with God and he talks to
[1:25:59] you and you talk
[1:26:01] back
[1:26:04] okay
[1:26:06] now and I will bless her and give thee a
[1:26:08] son also give thee a son also of her y I
[1:26:13] will bless her and she shall be a mother
[1:26:15] of Nations now God's never mentioned
[1:26:17] this before cuz Sarah is contentious you
[1:26:20] don't want a contentious woman to be
[1:26:22] it's like you know raising bees when you
[1:26:25] raise bees you you look at the character
[1:26:27] of The Beehive if that thing's if you
[1:26:30] watch outside and everything's running
[1:26:31] smooth and those bees are going in and
[1:26:33] out and and you open that Hive up and
[1:26:36] they're doing their job and everything's
[1:26:37] cool you got a good Queen she's a prince
[1:26:41] you look and you see if she's laying
[1:26:43] eggs everything's fine but you let
[1:26:45] something happen to that
[1:26:46] Queen we had one the other day go
[1:26:48] queenless we don't know if it died or
[1:26:50] they killed her or something because
[1:26:51] those bees if if the queen doesn't do
[1:26:53] her job they'll kill her cruel world but
[1:26:56] they make their own Queen and then they
[1:26:57] raise up one of their
[1:26:59] own so we go out there the other day we
[1:27:01] buy a queen and we're getting ready to
[1:27:03] put the queen and I said June you hear
[1:27:04] that this other Hive over here is just
[1:27:07] as quiet I mean you got 60,000 bees in
[1:27:09] that Hive they should be making a noise
[1:27:12] they just barely humming over here
[1:27:14] because this one's got a queen this Hive
[1:27:16] this Hive doesn't have a queen and it
[1:27:18] sounds like a buz
[1:27:21] saw that's how it sounded didn't
[1:27:23] you they were
[1:27:25] queenless they didn't have a queen they
[1:27:27] had no guidance they had no no no no uh
[1:27:31] stabilizing Factor she had become
[1:27:34] contentious and the whole Hive was
[1:27:36] upset but see you put a queen in there a
[1:27:40] princess it calms everything down amen
[1:27:45] natural types of
[1:27:46] spiritual then Abram listen and I will
[1:27:49] bless her and give thee a son also of
[1:27:50] her and yay I will bless her and she
[1:27:52] shall be a mother of Nations Kings of
[1:27:55] people shall be of her then Abram fell
[1:27:57] upon his face and
[1:28:01] laughed
[1:28:03] Abraham not
[1:28:05] Abram and said in his heart shall a
[1:28:08] child be born unto him that's 100 years
[1:28:09] old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old
[1:28:12] bear and ABR Abraham said unto God oh
[1:28:15] that
[1:28:18] ishma oh that ishma he's heading back in
[1:28:20] the other direction
[1:28:23] oh that ish may live before thee God
[1:28:26] just promised him another
[1:28:30] son and God said Sarah hello I'm sure

[1:29:02] the nose and said Sarah thy wife shall
[1:29:05] bear thee a son
[1:29:07] indeed and thou shalt call his name
[1:29:10] Isaac and I will establish my Covenant
[1:29:12] with him right the Next Generation with
[1:29:18] him and with his seed after him now
[1:29:23] and as for ishma he's not finished
[1:29:26] yet he's not

[1:29:31] heard thee behold I have blessed him and
[1:29:35] will make him fruitful and will multiply
[1:29:38] him exceedingly 12 princes shall he
[1:29:40] beget and I will make him a great nation
[1:29:46] but but I'm not
[1:29:49] finished he's going to be a wild child
[1:29:52] he's not going to be able to take a body
[1:29:54] change he's going to be a good Christian
[1:29:57] he's going to live his life he's going
[1:29:58] to be among his Brethren is that not
[1:29:59] what he just said in the Bible he's
[1:30:00] going to be among his Brethren he's not
[1:30:02] going to be separated he's going to be
[1:30:03] among his
[1:30:06] Brethren but my Covenant will I
[1:30:09] establish with
[1:30:12] Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee
[1:30:15] at this set time in the next year God's
[1:30:18] bringing it right down and said look
[1:30:20] this is where it's coming from right
[1:30:22] from right
[1:30:23] here so he goes and
[1:30:25] he cuts off the forkin
[1:30:28] and chapter
[1:30:31] 18 we see what
[1:30:33] happens and the Lord capital L LD
[1:30:37] appeared unto him in the plains of
[1:30:39] mammory he's right back to where he was
[1:30:41] in justification same place
[1:30:46] positionally everybody got that say Amen
[1:30:49] naturally Abram has took this journey
[1:30:51] now now he's Abraham God's giving him a
[1:30:54] promise now now Abraham knows where it's
[1:30:58] going to come
[1:31:01] from not another woman it's going to be
[1:31:05] Sarah and you're going to call his name
[1:31:09] Isaac so he's got it all he's got the
[1:31:11] program
[1:31:13] together and the Lord appeared to him in
[1:31:15] the plains of mamry and he sat in the
[1:31:17] tent during the heat of the day so he's
[1:31:19] right back to where he started at now
[1:31:22] look now they're in a condition for a
[1:31:26] body
[1:31:27] change cuz remember Abram was Journey
[1:31:31] Sarah was contentious Abram was the high
[1:31:34] father but now you and then they
[1:31:36] produced ishol which was a wild
[1:31:39] child now God said no
[1:31:43] Sarah no not Isaac see what God's doing
[1:31:49] when he when when God brings you the new
[1:31:51] birth and when God gets ready to place
[1:31:52] you it's all positive this is my son in
[1:31:56] whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye
[1:31:59] him hear what's going on all right so
[1:32:03] now we just be a few more
[1:32:05] minutes now they're in a condition for
[1:32:07] that now let's read the second quote
[1:32:10] quote number
[1:32:12] two Jehovah gy Long Beach
[1:32:15] California did you notice his name was a
[1:32:18] r h a m Abram Abram Abram then when he
[1:32:22] changed his name he gave him a name of
[1:32:25] ab a r a h a m Abraham taken in his own
[1:32:31] name
[1:32:32] Elohim making him a father see remember
[1:32:35] we get a name change that's a new birth
[1:32:37] right everybody wants to look for a name
[1:32:39] change over there you get a name change
[1:32:41] now you're Christian Jun got a name
[1:32:44] change when she married
[1:32:46] me amen she's a Dale now she's not a
[1:32:49] Thomas anymore she's a Dale she took on
[1:32:51] my my name so when we baptize in the
[1:32:53] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[1:32:55] repent and you go through this journey
[1:32:58] and you do the things of God and God
[1:32:59] burst you into the family your name's
[1:33:01] not whatever it is anymore it used to
[1:33:04] be drunker liar Thief stealer
[1:33:08] reviler name them all no you're
[1:33:11] Christian you're part of the family of
[1:33:13] God now see now you can partake of the
[1:33:17] communion now you can partake of the
[1:33:18] things and remember there are promises
[1:33:21] for
[1:33:23] ish so there's promises for
[1:33:26] everybody amen there's even promises for
[1:33:29] the foolish virgin there's promises for
[1:33:31] the
[1:33:33] 144,000 but it's not the promise that
[1:33:36] you and I get as being the Bride of
[1:33:38] Jesus Christ do you see what I'm talking
[1:33:40] about we're Abraham seed not
[1:33:43] Abram
[1:33:44] amen but he give us a part of his own
[1:33:47] name Elohim making him a father he's
[1:33:49] Elohim and he changed and put put part
[1:33:51] of his name on Abraham because he
[1:33:54] through the promise was to come through
[1:33:56] his seed father of Nations Abraham
[1:33:58] changed his name put part of his name
[1:34:00] onto it now making him a father of
[1:34:02] Nations now notice to Abraham and to his
[1:34:04] seed after him now not to his
[1:34:07] seeds but seed after him remember
[1:34:10] Galatians 3:16 it's not the seeds of
[1:34:12] Abraham that gets the promise there's a
[1:34:13] lot of people that was born even of
[1:34:16] Abraham that didn't get
[1:34:18] anything remember he got married to cout
[1:34:22] right or one of them it's over here
[1:34:26] somewhere is that right coutur I don't
[1:34:29] want to be wrong on that I don't want
[1:34:31] to but anyway they had about seven or
[1:34:34] eight more
[1:34:36] kids but you know what when he got ready
[1:34:38] to die he did give him a little
[1:34:42] something but he said
[1:34:44] Isaac is going to get the heir of all
[1:34:47] things same way with you and I I noticed
[1:34:49] Abraham and to his seed after him I not
[1:34:51] his seed but seed after him Abraham had
[1:34:53] many sons but the promised one was
[1:34:56] through Isaac and through Isaac came
[1:34:58] Christ The Royal seed the real Seed of
[1:35:01] Abraham all right the real Seed of
[1:35:04] Abraham
[1:35:06] amen so in Abram and ishal there's no
[1:35:09] body
[1:35:10] change Abram just had ish he' have to
[1:35:13] have a body change he could produce what
[1:35:15] he had right amen but remember the
[1:35:19] miracle was
[1:35:21] that
[1:35:22] Abraham and Sarah were almost 100 years
[1:35:26] old and required to
[1:35:29] produce that's the great mystery of you
[1:35:31] and I people look at you and and of
[1:35:35] course us males we don't change a whole
[1:35:36] lot because we we don't have to wear
[1:35:38] dress and long hair and stuff like that
[1:35:39] I hope
[1:35:40] not but the world can't see a difference
[1:35:42] shny if you become a Christian started
[1:35:44] coming to church here normal people
[1:35:46] would just see you as a regular person
[1:35:48] just normal but your actions and your
[1:35:51] reactions will tell what you are but see
[1:35:54] the sisters they can walk down through
[1:35:56] Walmart with their long hair the long
[1:36:00] dress no makeup no earrings you know
[1:36:03] what that makes you
[1:36:06] different so we as the Bride of Jesus
[1:36:08] Christ though we are female right
[1:36:12] amen we harp on the women all the time
[1:36:14] we're all women in the body of Christ so
[1:36:16] we should all have long hair and
[1:36:19] spiritually you understand what I'm
[1:36:20] saying not naturally
[1:36:22] in other words we should look different
[1:36:24] to the
[1:36:25] world even us males because don't don't
[1:36:28] fool yourself these little kids and that
[1:36:31] world is watching you cuz remember
[1:36:34] there's no other God they're going to
[1:36:35] see
[1:36:37] right hello there's no other God they're
[1:36:39] going to see but
[1:36:41] you and you can be
[1:36:45] contentious
[1:36:47] Sarah but God wants to change you to
[1:36:50] Sarah right to be a prince
[1:36:55] princess all right so Abram and ishal no
[1:37:00] change nobody changing Abram and
[1:37:03] ishm Abram's a good guy ish's a good kid
[1:37:08] ish's not that bad he just he's a wild
[1:37:10] child he's just different from the other
[1:37:12] because he got a different promise right
[1:37:15] same way with you and I we got a
[1:37:17] different promise and and remember even
[1:37:20] even Sarah what we look and we see there
[1:37:22] in chapter
[1:37:25] 18
[1:37:26] Sarah there's God now remember MDC meets
[1:37:30] Abram Abraham meets Abram in
[1:37:33] justification now he's meeting Abraham
[1:37:35] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:37:37] placing changing his name all right so
[1:37:40] God meets Abraham Abraham says my
[1:37:44] Lord and and God says you going to have
[1:37:47] a baby according to the time of life
[1:37:51] well Sarah goes back in the tent she's
[1:37:53] 99 years old or close to it and she
[1:37:56] starts
[1:37:58] sniggering she says me having pleasure
[1:38:00] with my Lord again natural she was
[1:38:02] thinking natural she needed some Faith
[1:38:06] problem is she had a little
[1:38:10] fear but what the problem was she didn't
[1:38:12] look at the promise that's why listen
[1:38:14] that's why Abraham is the father of our
[1:38:16] faith he looked at the promise he didn't
[1:38:20] look at the circumstance
[1:38:23] same way with with when with Ry and
[1:38:25] Gabby that you got anybody you got to
[1:38:28] the the circumstances are just that
[1:38:33] circumstances hey if you go to the
[1:38:35] hospital they going to stick you full of
[1:38:37] something they going to put a tube in
[1:38:39] you down you through you you going to
[1:38:42] look like not very healthy that's
[1:38:46] circumstances that's man's way of doing
[1:38:49] things that's man's idea that's not not
[1:38:51] God's way of doing it we got to look
[1:38:54] past that take that fear and let that
[1:38:57] fear sure we're all human we all have
[1:38:59] fears but turn that fear into Faith
[1:39:03] right that's why a lot of you think I'm
[1:39:05] hard about things but I just have faith
[1:39:07] I just believe God's going to take care
[1:39:08] of the thing your situation or mine
[1:39:12] God's just going to take care of it you
[1:39:15] know you you sat around and I'm
[1:39:17] sorry you sat around and you talk about
[1:39:20] well I wonder why this one died and I
[1:39:22] wonder why that so what they're
[1:39:25] gone what does it
[1:39:28] matter that's
[1:39:31] circumstances get up and go a great
[1:39:34] example King
[1:39:36] David remember the first child God said
[1:39:38] is going to
[1:39:39] die Bible says King David he' laid down
[1:39:42] on the floor all night long sackcloth
[1:39:45] and Ashes prayed to God for that baby
[1:39:48] and you remember the servants the
[1:39:50] servant was afraid to tell him that the
[1:39:53] baby had
[1:39:54] died because they thought man if he's
[1:39:56] acting this way he's going to go
[1:40:00] ballistic when he finds out that baby's
[1:40:02] dead well he perceives and looks at him
[1:40:05] and sees and says hey is the baby dead
[1:40:07] they say yeah Bible said he gets up goes
[1:40:09] takes a bath puts on his King's robe go
[1:40:12] sits down and eats bread and drinks
[1:40:14] wine and the servants are
[1:40:17] going and they ask him David
[1:40:21] David said there's nothing I can do
[1:40:25] now the only thing I can do is is make
[1:40:28] sure I go right to where he is right now
[1:40:32] boy you talking about something that
[1:40:33] settles all fear right something that
[1:40:35] settles anything I you know it I've
[1:40:38] never lost a child but but losing a
[1:40:40] child would be the the probably the
[1:40:41] worst thing in the world
[1:40:45] but being a Christian you have to do the
[1:40:47] same thing David did get back up put
[1:40:49] your robe on right go to work the next
[1:40:52] day testify that God's the greatest
[1:40:54] healer that there ever was know one
[1:40:57] thing for sure that God knew better than
[1:40:58] we did about what was going on and
[1:41:01] forget about the
[1:41:02] circumstances that's
[1:41:06] right now
[1:41:08] look if every son of the faith has to go
[1:41:11] through this
[1:41:12] journey let's read number
[1:41:15] three we're going to read three and four
[1:41:17] together Abraham's Grace Covenant
[1:41:19] Middletown Ohio 196 61 how they sit
[1:41:22] there now wait what's he doing he's
[1:41:24] showing to Abraham this what's he going
[1:41:25] to do to the Abraham seat now what was
[1:41:28] he on the road after Abraham after that
[1:41:31] he had been Justified Sanctified filled
[1:41:34] with the Holy Ghost in topes and shadows
[1:41:35] so see Abraham wasn't filled with the
[1:41:37] Holy Ghost in tops and
[1:41:40] shadows and had been placed got a your
[1:41:43] name then he came and he was giving a
[1:41:46] sign that the end was at hand he come
[1:41:49] down to destroy the the wicked sinful
[1:41:51] world of Sodom is that right now
[1:41:54] remember Jesus said Do you believe him
[1:41:55] Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:41:57] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:41:59] the son of man
[1:42:01] right there's no doubt we're in a
[1:42:03] sodomite condition right well Sodom all
[1:42:06] around but now look let me read number
[1:42:08] four it's it's a continuation down to
[1:42:10] paragraph 65 and the man God dwelling in
[1:42:13] flesh the man with his back turned to
[1:42:15] the tent said why did Sarah laugh saying
[1:42:17] in her heart that it can't be so told
[1:42:19] what Sarah was doing and what Sarah
[1:42:20] thought in her heart when she laughed to
[1:42:22] herself is that right what was it just a
[1:42:24] little bit before destruction he's doing
[1:42:27] the same thing to the Seed of Abraham
[1:42:29] and they don't recognize it
[1:42:32] Brethren that's
[1:42:36] 1961 they don't recognize it do they
[1:42:39] recognize it now I don't think so some
[1:42:41] don't he's doing the same thing to the
[1:42:43] Seed of Abraham and they don't recognize
[1:42:44] it Brethren see what I mean
[1:42:46] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:42:48] the Holy Ghost placing of the sun air
[1:42:50] God dwelling in his church human flesh
[1:42:55] eating drinking like man the Holy Spirit
[1:42:58] oh you know what people in the
[1:42:59] congregation are going he's talking
[1:43:00] about himself no he was talking about
[1:43:04] them right if they had a new birth
[1:43:07] dwelling in his church human flesh
[1:43:09] eating drinking like like man and the
[1:43:11] Holy Spirit God himself dwelling in the
[1:43:14] sons of Abraham manifesting the same
[1:43:17] thing that Jesus said as it was in the
[1:43:18] days of Sodom so shall it be at the
[1:43:20] coming of son of man do you get it
[1:43:25] amen MDC is not someone that we
[1:43:30] meet on the plains of mammory like
[1:43:33] Abraham did it's somebody you meet in
[1:43:37] church our fellowship our Bible
[1:43:44] study remember mzd became Jesus Christ
[1:43:48] and Jesus melz listen what was in in MDC

[1:43:57] mzc sitting there talking to Abraham is
[1:43:59] in you tonight right now the form it had
[1:44:02] to take another form to get into you cuz

[1:44:10] priest of the most high god without
[1:44:11] ending of days or beginning of days or
[1:44:13] ending of life
[1:44:15] right but he became Jesus Christ so that
[1:44:19] soul of MDC
[1:44:21] was Jesus amen amen we know that we
[1:44:23] preach that but I'm for the young one
[1:44:25] the soul of MDC was Jesus Christ not
[1:44:29] another person amen one
[1:44:32] God and Lord of all sir brother Bram
[1:44:36] says Abraham say God Jesus goes down
[1:44:40] tells the people in hell I'm the one
[1:44:43] that you turn down he comes back up
[1:44:45] through Paradise knocks on the door he
[1:44:47] said the first person to open the door
[1:44:49] was Abraham right Abraham said Sarah
[1:44:52] that's that man we fed a calf to well
[1:44:55] who was it Jesus Christ the theop of the
[1:44:59] man that had died just recently right in
[1:45:02] this Dimension was in another dimension
[1:45:04] and Abraham recognized him
[1:45:09] right now he's took a different
[1:45:12] form he's hid himself in his people
[1:45:17] amen he's hid himself in his people
[1:45:21] right it's not one man anymore come
[1:45:24] on all the god you're going to see is
[1:45:26] right here
[1:45:28] tonight it may not be me I'm talking
[1:45:30] about you amen amen amen but now watch I
[1:45:33] was telling the Sunday school class this
[1:45:35] is to get all this down to one
[1:45:37] thing if every son of the faith has got
[1:45:40] to take this journey at Final End right
[1:45:43] all right this was the thought that came
[1:45:44] to me the other
[1:45:45] day and we're teaching downstairs on the
[1:45:48] Statue of a perfect man and we're on
[1:45:49] brotherly kindness
[1:45:51] well now let's go to Mark
[1:45:53] 12
[1:45:55] Abraham actually
[1:45:57] fulfilled the two greatest
[1:46:01] Commandments before the Commandments we
[1:46:03] even
[1:46:05] written oh I'm glad you're
[1:46:08] quiet Mark 12: 29 says and Jesus
[1:46:11] answered him in in other words the
[1:46:13] Scribe asked him say what's the greatest
[1:46:15] of all commandments of all 10 what's the
[1:46:17] greatest Jesus answered and said the
[1:46:19] first of all
[1:46:21] the Commandments is here o Israel the
[1:46:24] Lord our God is one Lord one
[1:46:29] God and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:46:32] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[1:46:33] with all thy mind with all thy strength
[1:46:35] this is the first
[1:46:37] commandment verse 31 says and the second
[1:46:40] is like namely this Thou shalt love thy
[1:46:43] neighbor as thyself there is none other
[1:46:47] commandment greater than
[1:46:53] these I'm telling you people come
[1:46:55] downstairs sometime and let's talk about
[1:46:57] brotherly
[1:46:59] kindness some of them head's been
[1:47:01] rolling in the floor boy you ought have
[1:47:03] seen them the other day when I told them
[1:47:04] because you know what brother Brown said
[1:47:07] the the example of Brotherly kindness
[1:47:09] was in the book of Acts the whole
[1:47:13] congregation sold their possession and
[1:47:16] give them to
[1:47:17] Peter money and
[1:47:21] land any y'all want to try it then you
[1:47:24] ain't got brotherly
[1:47:26] kindness that's what brother random said
[1:47:29] he said they sold everything gave it to
[1:47:32] Peter remember that's where ananas and
[1:47:33] sa fire came cuz there was two people a
[1:47:35] husband and wife team that had sold some
[1:47:37] land kept some of the money and just
[1:47:39] give them and said is this all it wasn't
[1:47:41] that they it wasn't totally that they
[1:47:43] kept the money is that when Peter asked
[1:47:45] them said is this all and they said we
[1:47:46] give all well they were lying Peter
[1:47:49] didn't say you li didn't lie to me he
[1:47:51] said you lied to the Holy Ghost well now
[1:47:53] what the Holy Ghost tell him to do sell
[1:47:55] everything everything bring it common
[1:47:57] and let brother Dale distribute it to
[1:48:00] us they got quiet just like you got
[1:48:03] quiet brother BR said that is a perfect
[1:48:06] example of Brotherly
[1:48:09] kindness you do what you want to
[1:48:11] do but that's what he said and it's the
[1:48:15] second of the greatest of two
[1:48:16] Commandments you shall love thy neighbor
[1:48:19] as thyself
[1:48:21] and Abram Abraham said no we'll talk
[1:48:23] that in just a second hang on so
[1:48:27] Abraham what's the first thing Abraham
[1:48:30] says to MDC when he sees the three
[1:48:33] walking down the road what does he say
[1:48:36] he says my
[1:48:38] Lord he got his one God Doctrine
[1:48:42] right here o Israel the Lord our God is
[1:48:45] one
[1:48:46] Lord Abraham had a revelation
[1:48:51] that that was God and them two beside
[1:48:53] wasn't Jesus and the Holy
[1:48:56] Ghost
[1:48:57] amen amen so he got his one God Doctrine
[1:49:01] that's the first commandment second
[1:49:03] commandment you say how did that happen
[1:49:05] after all that happened God said I'm
[1:49:07] going to Sodom and I'm going to destroy
[1:49:10] that Nation I'm going to destroy every
[1:49:12] person down there what Abraham
[1:49:16] say love thy
[1:49:18] neighbor as You Love of yourself he said
[1:49:20] God if you can find 50 people would you
[1:49:23] spare
[1:49:25] Sodom if you can find 20 will you spare
[1:49:28] Sodom God said I'll spare
[1:49:30] it you can find 10 will you spare Sodom
[1:49:34] look at the look at the kindness of the
[1:49:36] man now Abraham didn't have nothing to
[1:49:38] do with Sodom he didn't like Sodom he
[1:49:40] didn't go to Sodom but when he saw God
[1:49:42] getting ready to destroy a
[1:49:45] Brother come on
[1:49:48] people brotherly kindness is one of of
[1:49:50] the hardest things we're going to have
[1:49:51] to be able to conquer because it's right
[1:49:53] up there next to
[1:49:55] love you got to love your neighbor I
[1:49:58] don't care if that neighbor shoots your
[1:50:01] dog I don't care if that neighbor is so
[1:50:04] contrary to you it doesn't matter you
[1:50:06] got to love that person as you love
[1:50:08] yourself not just it's easy to love it's
[1:50:10] easy for me to love
[1:50:13] June cuz I love her because she loves me
[1:50:17] but how about me loving somebody don't
[1:50:19] care a thing about me right see that's
[1:50:21] what Abraham so every son of the faith
[1:50:24] has got to take that final Journey
[1:50:26] there's those two greatest Commandments
[1:50:27] and Abraham is producing them in that
[1:50:30] one
[1:50:31] scene he knows that that man's God and
[1:50:33] there's no
[1:50:34] other and then God said I'm going to
[1:50:36] Sodom and I'm going to destroy
[1:50:37] everything down there Abraham said God
[1:50:40] please they're my brothers they're my
[1:50:44] neighbors they must have been close
[1:50:46] because remember you could turn and
[1:50:48] look and see got him from where Abraham
[1:50:51] was that's what the Bible said so God
[1:50:53] says no if you Abraham said if you can
[1:50:55] find 50 you know he got down to 10 well
[1:50:58] you know there was four down
[1:51:00] there he didn't get down to four you
[1:51:02] know what if he had said four God would
[1:51:04] have spared
[1:51:05] Sodom amen lot his wife and two two
[1:51:09] girls they were down there but he
[1:51:12] stopped at 10 Abraham if you can Abra
[1:51:15] said if you can find 10 God said if I
[1:51:16] can find 10 I'll spare but he couldn't
[1:51:18] find 10 so he destroyed that Nation but
[1:51:22] do you see what I'm talking about every
[1:51:23] we can't just take this journey of Abram
[1:51:26] and disclude it because it's
[1:51:29] important it does
[1:51:32] produce amen then you got the Journey of
[1:51:35] Abraham which produces something
[1:51:38] different
[1:51:40] amen not just be born again and live a
[1:51:42] good Christian Life that's okay but our
[1:51:45] mandate is to go on and produce a son
[1:51:48] and God's got to change our bodies for
[1:51:49] for us to produce that
[1:51:52] son and we're in the change
[1:51:57] now but watch how that God through
[1:52:02] Abraham in Genesis 22:5 this is the last
[1:52:04] one let's stand musicians come and
[1:52:07] Abraham said unto his young men now God
[1:52:10] had told Abraham
[1:52:13] Abraham Johnny the Bible told Abraham
[1:52:16] God told Abraham to take that one son
[1:52:19] that he had now you've only got one son
[1:52:21] he's your son he's your promised son
[1:52:23] there's nobody else he's only the one
[1:52:25] that's going to perpetuate your species
[1:52:26] your your your generation okay God tells
[1:52:29] Abraham should go up there and kill
[1:52:33] him that what he said take thy son thine
[1:52:37] only son Isaac and go sacrifice
[1:52:42] him but watch Abraham in the spoken
[1:52:47] word I know people said well he can come
[1:52:50] back with a spoonful of Ashes that's not
[1:52:51] what Abraham
[1:52:57] said Abraham said unto his young
[1:53:01] men I'm not
[1:53:04] afraid I'm going to take him up there
[1:53:06] anyway that's right I have no
[1:53:10] fear abide here with the ass and I and
[1:53:15] the lad will go Yonder and worship and
[1:53:18] come again to you you that's
[1:53:21] right Ryan that was from Fear to Faith
[1:53:24] you and I would have been so fearful to
[1:53:26] say God you give me one
[1:53:30] child to create Nations out of that
[1:53:33] child and now you want me to go kill him
[1:53:36] no there
[1:53:40] circumstances If Abraham would have
[1:53:42] looked at all those
[1:53:43] circumstances no the Bible never said he
[1:53:47] staggered he said we're going up there
[1:53:50] right and I'm going to trust by faith
[1:53:53] that when I walk in that
[1:53:55] room that's my
[1:54:00] baby that's my
[1:54:03] child and though man says it's going to
[1:54:07] die though we've done everything we can
[1:54:09] do because Ryan and Gabby came to Bible
[1:54:11] study that night I didn't know this till
[1:54:14] he told me later they were expecting
[1:54:16] that baby to die
[1:54:18] right I told him I said
[1:54:21] Ryan you walk in that room with fear and
[1:54:23] that baby's going to feel it you know
[1:54:26] what I said I said you walk into that
[1:54:27] room with fear that baby's going to feel
[1:54:29] it I said you walk in there with faith
[1:54:30] that none of that's going on you can't
[1:54:33] deny what's going on baby's there baby's
[1:54:38] sick but you deny what the doctor said
[1:54:40] you have faith right you have faith for
[1:54:43] that baby cuz that baby can't have
[1:54:45] faith change that fear to
[1:54:48] Faith tell them what
[1:54:51] happened from that point Ryan said from
[1:54:54] that day the very moment they walked in
[1:54:55] that room from that day till now that
[1:54:57] baby's got better every
[1:54:59] day every day
[1:55:02] hallelujah oh we'd love to have a
[1:55:05] miracle and have her here
[1:55:08] now what does that
[1:55:10] matter the human body if there's not an
[1:55:13] instant Miracle the human body has to go
[1:55:15] through a process to get rid of all the
[1:55:18] drugs that they gave the to get rid of
[1:55:20] all these things that the baby that
[1:55:22] tracheal tube and all that stuff you
[1:55:23] know there nurses and people that's had
[1:55:25] them before I've never had one but it
[1:55:26] just tears your throat up so you know
[1:55:28] little baby the same way your body's got
[1:55:30] to heal but my point is Abraham took
[1:55:35] that child up
[1:55:37] there and he said me and that
[1:55:40] child are coming
[1:55:42] back now he didn't say I don't care what
[1:55:45] God said he said no I heard what God
[1:55:46] Said I know what God Said
[1:55:50] but I got a
[1:55:53] promise Isaac can't be
[1:55:55] ashes and me bring him
[1:55:58] back he said the lad and I will return
[1:56:03] He said same way with you and I you when
[1:56:06] you go through a
[1:56:09] problem say
[1:56:11] God whatever the problem
[1:56:14] is the lad and
[1:56:18] I will return
[1:56:22] amen oh you see a lot of problems happen
[1:56:24] and you go man I I've never been through
[1:56:27] this problem before you know what
[1:56:29] somebody
[1:56:31] has and there one thing for sure Jesus
[1:56:35] knows all about it
[1:56:37] anyway when are we going to do that one
[1:56:41] thing take God at his word
[1:56:44] right
[1:56:46] regardless regardless now put your
[1:56:49] yourself in Abraham's
[1:56:51] shoes I've only got one son that the
[1:56:54] promises to be made
[1:56:56] through and now you want me to go kill
[1:56:59] him he went and done what God Said but
[1:57:03] his
[1:57:05] attitude his attitude changed didn't
[1:57:09] change God's
[1:57:11] mind but it changed the circumstance
[1:57:14] right cuz remember he was getting ready
[1:57:17] to kill the child he wasn't up there
[1:57:19] trying to yes and trying to figure out
[1:57:20] how to get out of it that's our problem
[1:57:22] a lot of times we try to figure out how
[1:57:24] to get out of it no he raised the knife
[1:57:28] he was going to stab that
[1:57:35] child God said now I
[1:57:37] know in other words God really he said
[1:57:40] that but God said Abraham now you know
[1:57:43] that I'm with
[1:57:45] you and that whatever you
[1:57:48] say what do you think Jesus
[1:57:54] got believe on that
[1:57:57] mountain it's what you say to this
[1:58:00] mountain it shall be mve right
[1:58:03] amen Abram's voice Abraham's voice
[1:58:06] thundered into heaven the lad and I will
[1:58:09] return God thought so much of his son he
[1:58:11] said that's exactly the way it's going
[1:58:12] to happen right same way with you and I
[1:58:15] any situation we're going to sing a song

[2:06:23] the most refreshing
[2:06:25] songs oh it can harm our body and Satan
[2:06:29] we live in Satan's domain and he just
[2:06:31] beats us to
[2:06:33] death but all if it's well with your
[2:06:35] soul what does it
[2:06:39] matter what does it
[2:06:41] matter what's the circumstances make any
[2:06:45] difference God never dealt with
[2:06:47] circumstances
[2:06:49] you going to have a son Abraham well now
[2:06:52] you're
[2:06:53] 99 you can't produce you're God don't
[2:06:57] have
[2:06:59] checklist we make
[2:07:02] checklist what we should do and
[2:07:04] shouldn't do what should happen and what
[2:07:07] shouldn't
[2:07:09] happen but down
[2:07:12] inside there's only one
[2:07:14] sense Faith or
[2:07:17] doubt Faith or
[2:07:19] doubt that's it there's no gray area
[2:07:23] there's Faith let's put it this way
[2:07:26] there's Faith or
[2:07:29] fear there's Faith or fear in your in
[2:07:33] your Walk of Life we thought we had the
[2:07:38] world bull by the horns they say we were
[2:07:44] indestructible that's a
[2:07:46] lie that was Satan's way of giving us
[2:07:50] something to appease what God wanted to
[2:07:53] give
[2:07:55] us but if you'll be real honest with
[2:07:58] yourself if you're not born again there
[2:08:00] is
[2:08:01] fear there is
[2:08:03] fear and even being born again we have a
[2:08:06] fear of God okay we have a fear of God
[2:08:09] which is not like that kind of fear
[2:08:11] because fear that fear of God is
[2:08:13] reverence of God we we fear that we're
[2:08:17] not worthy enough but you know what
[2:08:19] there we go
[2:08:20] again making
[2:08:23] checklist no it's Well with My Soul if
[2:08:28] it's well with your
[2:08:30] soul if we're Abram if we're Abram and
[2:08:33] don't make the
[2:08:35] change we still got a promise we're
[2:08:38] going to come
[2:08:39] up we're going to live in the city we're
[2:08:42] going to be just as Eternal as God is
[2:08:45] but listen
[2:08:46] people like I said before there's a
[2:08:49] mandate I'm sorry we stayed this long
[2:08:51] but there's a mandate of Abraham coming
[2:08:53] on the
[2:08:54] scene meeting
[2:08:56] MDC and taking a body change somebody
[2:08:59] will do
[2:09:01] it now you need to figure out whether
[2:09:04] you're under the ministry to be able to
[2:09:06] do that or
[2:09:08] not and if you are then stay there if
[2:09:11] you're not find somewhere cuz that's
[2:09:13] your
[2:09:14] mandate God will tell you if you're
[2:09:17] honest enough he told Abraham he said
[2:09:20] Abraham or he told Abram walk before me
[2:09:22] and be perfect then he said I'm going to
