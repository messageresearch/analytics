========================================

have a word prior before we go into the baptismal service and ask the lord to bless these and be baptized so that's the purpose of it father we thank you this day for your love and your grace and trust thank you for the word that we've heard today now we come to just fulfill more of it we can just come to you and lord believe you and just baptize these that lord has been desiring to be baptized pray that you bless them now if you fill them with the holy ghost the reason for being baptized is not to wash away our sins but an answer of a good conscience do what you say lord and follow you we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen everybody here since we have some new ones here i'm telling jim coming down the road i think i'll we're going to read our scripture in romans 6 we have the bible but then i'm going to go back and just kind of speak a moment about uh why we baptize the way we about why we baptize the name of the lord jesus christ not entitled father son holy ghost like the rest of the world if that's all right amen we got all evening it's much needed in romans chapter 6 now we've got two brothers to be baptized if anybody else wants to be baptized i'm not going to come out of here to him so we do all right the bible says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound paul said god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know you not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death of course that's what we do this is the burial ground this is where we bring it right here we bring the burial we bury the person and when the person dies the old man don't come back okay all right therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life or if we have been planted together what do you do with a seed you plant it that's what we're going to do we're going to plant it now what does the seed do when it's planted it dies it rots but there's life in there and that life comes back up in newness of life that's what paul's talking about for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection so there's a promise knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed not just hung up not just put aside not just put him in a closet till we need him but destroy it hence henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin you can't accuse the dead man of anything thank you dead man of stealing my grandfather's been dead for 60-something years you could accuse him of stealing yesterday all you wanted to he's dead so that's what we're talking about here we're coming out of death now if we be dead with christ we believe that we also shall live with him so we're being identified with what's going on knowing that christ being raised from the dead diet no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god now paul summed this up likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed into sin but alive unto god to jesus christ our lord now you see this in verse 3 it says no you're not in so many of us as we're baptized into jesus christ now if i'm a dale i'm identified as a dale okay this is for the youngest even even for for hank and and some of those that are new among us i'm a dale because i was i was in the family of dale i was born in the family of dale so that identifies me with the dale family is that correct all right now i'm a father my son josh he's not here but he's it's sure i'm a son there's my daddy and i'm a spirit but now that's not my name i can't go down to the bank and sign my name father son holy spirit they'll say who are you who are you you know i want you to identify who you are who are you and i tell him samuel wade dale ii well then see they identify me with that name so we go over here to the book of matthew and read what jesus said because we're going to fulfill this great commission and this great commission is jesus is in galilee and he's given the great commission before he's called up he says then the 11 disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given to me in heaven and in earth go you therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name name singular name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost now it does not say in the name of the father in the name of the son and the name of the holy ghost that's how that baptized in the denominational world they say we'll take what jesus said well this is exactly what he's telling you to do he's telling you to be identified with the father and the son and the holy ghost all right teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world now let's go over to our to acts and we see that peter in the book of acts now what does peter say peter peter gets up on the day of pentecost and remember he's a spokesman right didn't jesus say i give you the keys of the kingdom whatever you buying on earth i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven well peter is fixing to lose something he's fixing to lose something on this earth that has been eroded down through the ages by denominational world and denominational teachings in our own teaching their own ideas it says well you need to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost you know that's true we're going to baptize just exactly what jesus said to do today amen because peter couldn't say anything different because peter gets up and preaches a wonderful sermon in the book of acts here in acts 2. but he gets to acts 2 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart in other words they were convicted in their soul and said unto peter unto the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do now peter could have said should have said well you need to be baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost but that's what jesus said he's telling them the exact way to be baptized then peter said unto them repent so that's the first thing repent repent then be baptized every one of you i like that it's not just you every one of you in the name of jesus christ well what does that do if we bury our brothers in baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ we have given them part of the family name amen that identifies them with the family of god amen uh i've told you many times before in my uh even being raised in a message you read even the old testament says my name my name my name well father son holy ghost is not a name titles to a name so that's what jesus was telling them i want you to baptize in my name and the name is the lord jesus christ not father father's not a name son's not a name holy ghost is not a name it's titles to a name repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and here's the promise and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost so here's your first route for the holy ghost if you want to receive the holy ghost repent be baptized be identified with the family and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise what that promise that if you'll do these things isn't to you to your children and to all and i circle that in my bible all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and then it was three thousand souls baptized in the name of jesus christ not titles father son holy ghost in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you know what the 3 000 it's the bible says it was they were added to the kingdom right so they must have received the holy ghost that was the kingdom like brother daniel so this is the kingdom of god the holy ghost that anointing is going to come on you and going to stay on you not just an anointing of the holy ghost it's an indwelling but it starts by identifying yourself with the family there's no other way i could be a dale unless i was born one right you being born a black you know what you're still going to keep the name black you're still going to be that pickle i'm talking that you're talking about but we're going to baptize you and god's going to fill you with the holy ghost yeah you are i've already you we're just doing this to confirm uh you're a good young good young christian man so before we start let's pray one more time um brother bob black can you just pray over these two right here and if anybody else wants to be baptized please david go ahead this power he is lord jesus we thank you for this day the lord god i believe that these two brothers have a confession that they can't live without you lord i believe that when you died on the cross it was because you couldn't live without us and i pray god that you'll come down upon the scene today and recognize their testimony lord jesus because we know that your promise still lives on 2 000 years later lord that you you still are fulfilling your promise that you'll come live in the hearts of me and god i pray that you'll remember your promise this evening lord god i pray that you'll grant it that you'll make today a tie post that they can look back only when the devil comes with temptations and and lies and doubts and figures that something wasn't right lord they'll look back on this day and remember that they met every requirement they repented and were baptized in the name not a name of titles but a name by revelation god i pray that when they come up from the water lord that you're giving them something that will just live on and carry them through until they win the race lord jesus we ask it lord jesus believing lord god that you're still here and still remembering what you promised 2 000 years ago lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen somebody's car shouted come on oh you heard what i'm saying yep and that's what we're gonna do all right we're gonna baptize you into the family all right all right now this is an expression an outward expression that an inward worker started so you got a journey to take when you come up out of that water that's when the devils are going to start too so don't worry about what they got to say just listen to what i say in the bible so that's what the word says if the word says it no devil in hell can go past what i just said in that promise ready to fulfill the great commission that the lord jesus told us to go into all the world and preach the gospel baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost i now baptize my brother hank black in the name of the lord jesus christ amen hey listen my mother was baptized in gainesville georgia and the fountains in town were frozen all right when she come out of the water there was i can remember this as a boy the icicles were hanging off of her hair you know what you don't feel it when you feel it don't feel it don't feel it when you feel it fulfill the great commission yeah baptize all new converts in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost i baptized my brother black black in the name of the lord jesus christ anybody else water's just getting warm now this is not feeling good i'm going home with it you gotta go home with it everybody all mine's clear there you go amen hallelujah all to fulfill the great commission the baptized all-new converts in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost how many of you remember this time i baptize my sister martha black in the name of the lord why not glad that you smile it's one thing that i remember when i came out of the water i remembered i was empty i had an empty feeling that that's right past anything i'd ever experienced in my life and brother dean said his angel well we used to baptize down there there was a big old tree hanging over the hanging over the hole he said there's an angel sitting in those winds right you know what they're clapping their hand but you know what that's the only joy angels get right we get the joy of having all this here but the angels have one joy and that's to praise god that's right help a new one into the kingdom you pray for these you know as well as i do though when i come up out of that water i felt empty a few days later the devil found that out so you be careful i might go to the house and just stay inside keep the door locked i wish i the devil knows he's only got a short time that's right devil's only got a short time and if he can stop you right here if the devil can stop you right here he's got your weapon that's right you got to be identified with the family welcome these into the family of god amen thank you for the swordless lord this day now we have a responsibility because of christ in front of them let this encourage us until we cut them together again in a new world we ask us to know the lord jesus christ we just must bless us all jesus amen amen
