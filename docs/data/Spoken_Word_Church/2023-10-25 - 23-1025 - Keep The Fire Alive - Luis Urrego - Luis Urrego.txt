see each and every one of you amen God bless you all and good to also have our campers back again amen I know that they had a good good time sister Rachel I'm hope hopefully you got some rest yeah and I know yeah I know you got lots going on and sister Esther too amen I hope you all enjoyed and uh a lot of people came back and they they were sick when they came back but you know change of weather and and and being around with different people I guess that does it to you so just pray for those individuals I know Bella she she she fell under the weather a bit and and so but um we're just pressing on amen amen I know that they had a good time we had we hear good testimonies that came back from the um personal testimonies that happened even on my side of the family that I'm I'm so so happy about that God God definitely answers prayer and maybe maybe maybe we can I can touch upon that uh as later on in the in the service um I'm sure my sister wouldn't mind at all but uh God is God is good I I'll tell you this God will do whatever he can whatever he must do for just one person he he'll Shake Heaven and Earth just for your soul and I believe that he did that this past weekend and if you if you ever if you get a chance to even go back and watch the services I I I recommend that you do because for one you know brother brother Andrew Glover wasn't even supposed to be there Noe and he and and and brother Donnie Reagan was the one who was supposed to be there to preach and brother Andrew was supposed to be in New Zealand somewhere and that got cancelled so brother Jason Watkins asked if he could come and and speak at the at the at the at the camp so he he said yeah and that's exactly what my niece is needed that's exactly what what they needed not that brother Donnie Reagan wouldn't have done a good job or nothing like that no it's just that that's what they needed and and and you know what happened last week as well or two I guess it was last week brother Donnie's daughter she passed away where brother Donnie couldn't couldn't be there so you know you you might think well you know sad things happened but then good things happened in that results out of that and I believe that with all my heart so so I just thank God and give him all the glory for it amen praise the Lord Jesus amen maybe I might get into the details of it uh later on but let as as you're standing let's just um let's just bow our heads first and then we'll read the word our heavenly father we thank you Lord once again for the opportunity that we have Lord to open back the pages of your word Lord your people had made preparations they to come Lord and and Lord they they they took of their time Lord this evening to come Lord and not to hear from a man Lord but to hear father from you Lord Jesus and I pray heavenly father that you will not disappoint them Lord God lord may you speak through our lips Lord Jesus and and may you heavenly father have your way here this evening forgive us for our sins Lord if there's anything that would hinder the rest of this service father from receiving from you forgive us father and we place it under the blood of Jesus Christ right now Lord we ask that you would continue to bless those father that are sick amongst as you continue to bless brother brother Dale Lord continue to be with with with Nanny Lord God and and the family Lord

this evening I commit myself now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen well this this this evening Saints I wanted to um I wanted to dedicate this this this service to our young people so all the young people that were there at the youth camp and I think maybe mercy and and Harmony they're they're they're back there so I want them to listen carefully too uh but um I want I want I mean this goes for all of us because it's the word but I wanted to I wanted to to to kind of keep encourage you um and I wanted to I wanted to title this keep keep the fire alive amen keep the fire alive because we're living in an age Saints at this at this time that you young people have an opportunity to put us adults to shame because you have the opportunity Amen to keep the fire alive amen when people are dying and and and and thinking well I've I've I've been a Christian 30 40 50 years and and and and that's that's time you know let's stay out of church and just kind of not just going through the motions you don't have to be that way you don't have to come to be that way amen you can be on fire for God and stay on fire for God Amen because let me tell you what you you the way you catch on fire amen that helps us adults catch on fire when we see you on fire for God Amen that Sparks something in in us and say wait a second if they're doing it then me knowing what I've known for the past 40 years I certainly can be in their same in their same category you see so you don't have to amen don't look at some some of us as examples unfortunately we've let you down sometimes amen but the word of God Amen doesn't let you down you stay on fire for God Amen and Look to Him amen because he's the only one that can help you now there are people amen that you can confide and then you can turn to and and I I suggest that you that you you come to those people when you need help especially your parents if you know that they're on fire for God Amen come to them speak to them amen praise God there's people that can help you spiritually but unfortunately there's some people that that can't amen but you can continue you can continue amen and so I just want to encourage enourage you amen this evening Amen to keep the fire alive because that helps us that helps us and we need that in this hour amen amen praise the Lord Jesus so while you're standing let's just read real quickly a few verses here in in Leviticus chapter 6 and this was about this is uh in in regards to the offering of the daily sacrifices there uh in in in in the Old Testament and it says here in verse 8 Leviticus 6:8 and it says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying command Aaron and his sons saying this is the law of the burnt offering it is the burnt offering because of the burning upon the altar all night unto morning and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it amen and with that you can just be seated and we'll continue reading here amen and the priest verse 10 and it says and the priest shall put on his linen garment and his Lin britches shall he put upon his flesh and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the Altar and he shall put them beside the Altar and he shall put off his garments and put on other garments put on other garments and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it notice this is a second time is talking about that fire keep keep that fire burning it shall not be put out amen and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning so there was something that the priest had to do every morning in order for that fire to keep burning right there was something amen that the priest had to do physically and there's something that you and I have to do to keep going this fire going amen it'd be nice if God if we just lay in and God just lays it all on our lap amen but there's something that you and I have to do in order to keep this fire burning amen that's right and praise the Lord Jesus it shall not be put out by the Commandment of the Lord and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning and lay the burnt offering in order upon it and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings in verse 13 and it says the fire shall ever be burning upon the altar three times right three times he says here the fire shall ever be burning upon the Altar and it shall never go out praise the Lord Jesus amen why did God not want that fire to go out amen if you think about it the children of Israel at that time they were supposed to offer sacrifices unto the Lord amen and there were yearly sacrifices but then there were also Daily sacrifices that were to be offered as well by the priests these were the Commandments to the priest in order to offer daily sacrifices right so you you you think about this Saints the children of Israel that fire had in the altar had to keep burning and I can imagine the people of Israel outside of the outside of the Tabernacle outside of where where they would offer the the the the the sacrifices and they would they could be doing whatever the the the the father could be there sawing and and making something and the and the and the mom could cooking the meal and the children playing amen but they could just look back at the camp amen back where the where the S where the altar is and they could see that that fire is still lit they could see that that fire is still lit and they're like well all right the high priest is still doing what he's supposed to do the priests are still doing what they're supposed to do amen because every morning they had to go back there and put fire in it in order to keep that thing burning and it wasn't their idea it was a command of the Lord for them to keep doing that amen that was the only way to keep the fire burning Saints and amen in this day Saints amen there's something that you and I must do Amen in order to keep the fire of God burning in our Souls praise the Lord Jesus amen the the the time at the camp amen that was wonderful and that was good young people listen to me it was wonderful what you experienced and and what you went through amen but now you come to to to daily life you're back at the routine you're back at doing homework you're back at doing your your your your home school again you're back at at at brushing your teeth in your own bathroom now and doing everything that you were accustomed to doing back at church back at seeing the people that you see every week amen but it is not time amen Satan will come in if you're not careful and let's say you're back at the routine now let's get back to doing what you were doing before camp been there done that I got the t-shirt and the mouse pad too and the hat Satan That's what Satan wants you to do get back to your routine so get back to your coldness get back to to to to to uh to uh not reading the word oh that you had the word at the camp you had everything at the camp but now amen it's time to bring the same fire amen into your daily living praise God these priests had to keep that fire going daily praise the Lord amen and I like what it says here in verse in verse uh uh I'm I'm going to read it in the Contemporary English version because it's more understandable understandable in that in that in that version but it says here in verse 11 it says change into your everyday clothes the Lord was telling them to change they they would put the sacrifice or the animal there uh the night before and they would keep that fire burning and the whole night that that that sacrifice or that animal was burning the next morning the priest would come they would take the ashes and the Bible says here that he they he would they would have to they would have to change back from their Priestly clothes into every day clothes and then go back and dispose of the ashes amen so it's in your everyday walk with God Amen they still had to do what God said they still had to obey amen the word of the Lord because that was the word of the Lord to take the the sins and the weights that do so easily beset you amen and take him outside of the altar amen and then come back and the morning after amen put more wood in there so that fire can keep burning amen praise the Lord Jesus so it was their Duty and it was the responsibility to do that so that the people amen could offer the Lambs offer them the the the the things that they needed to offer in order to have their sins forgiven amen and it's up to you the Bible tells me Amen in Romans chap I can't remember the chapter but it's in Romans where Paul says amen that to offer yourself as a Living Sacrifice amen you must offer yourself as a Living Sacrifice praise the Lord every camp meeting no no every day every day it takes a dying out amen and it's hard I'll be the first one to tell you it's hard right to die out to flesh to die out to to the spirit and and and to your thinking that that I don't want to wake up and read the Bible today I just want to sleep in a little bit more I I don't I don't feel like getting down on my knees to pray I just want to sleep in a little a little bit more I'm 43 and I still have to battle it but you know what when you do get up and and and you get I mean and you just at least stand up to do it that's right man hey man you feel so accomplished amen they they talk about making your bed that's good and that's fine amen but you raise your hand to pray amen you did something good you you you accomplished something then not just for yourself physically but for your spirit for your soul for your soul amen praise God it takes a dying out you don't want to die out to yourself amen but if you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and if you've experienced had an experience with God Amen that inside of you amen wants to it's pulsating and making you you you you want to do that because there's no life out there in in in in in this world it's temporary Joy right brother right there's temporary joy in in things out here in the world in the bars and in and in the clubs and in the in the schools dances and in all these things but it it's not fulfilling it's not Eternal fulfilling amen what you the only thing that I always say this the only thing that you'll take from this life is what you did for Christ and what you did for others amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so the fire must never go out so put wood on it each morning after this you are to lay an animal on the altar next to the fact that you sacrifice to ask my blessing then send it all up in and smoke to me the altar fire must always be keep kept burning it must never go out Amen brother Brandon would say like this he said now notice when this great moving power of God comes into a Son of God Amen do you believe that you're a Son of God Amen I praise the Lord Jesus God acts upon your confession amen praise God it quickens him the spirit of Life enters into him amen then what does it do it seats them in Heavenly places right now right amen praise the Lord right now not tomorrow amen right now the Bible says that right now you are sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise the Lord not not they will be we are now praise the Lord now we've already resurrected the Dynamics and the mechanics has gone to work quickened us you notice that the mechanics and Dynamics amen the only way for those things those things to work properly there has to be fire involved right if there's no fire involved then then then then the car can't move amen there's got to be a even a a spark just a little spark amen is fire amen and it's and it's enough fire Amen to to to to light up that gasoline and that combustion and make that car move right praise the Lord Jesus it's enough fire amen that's why fire is so important amen and so it says here and we quickened up into the presence of God where his spirit is and now we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen do you believe that in Christ Jesus sitting in there that great seat that's already fired up hey amen being raised from the dead amen praise the Lord I'm so glad that Jesus already took care of it for me now I just got to do it follow amen where the head goes the body goes amen and I just want to move wherever he's moving praise the Lord amen if he raised amen and I know I'll raised with him praise the Lord Jesus well that's already fired up that seat's fired up y there's no excuses in this hour amen that that that Mercy Seat is fired up I like what the what brother Brandon says there that's the sprinkling of the blood amen everything is already it's it it's lit amen amen as young people say today it's lit it's already fired up it's ready to go there's nothing that you and me have to do other than keep putting that wood in there amen they keep that fire burning amen praise the Lord what is the wood amen you're human Humanity right amen right it it's your Humanity y right the Bible ties Humanity with wood so what are we sacrificing our own selves amen when we keep putting that wood in that fire amen you could put in sacrificing your own s so that he can live Bible says that he is a consuming fire amen so to keep that consuming fire going Amen in your life you've got to sacrifice yourself amen right die out to yourself die out to your own thinking die out to your own reasoning die out to your own plans praise the Lord Jesus and get in his plan amen his plan is perfect his plan won't fail you am praise the Lord you may not understand it at the moment but it at the end it will never fail am it has it has it has a good uh it has um uh I forgot the phrase of you English isn't my first language so I can't think as quick as some of you all can but it but it but but it's thinking of you in other words it's it's it has the your best in mind amen praise the Lord the word always has the best in mind and I and I believe that that every answer to every problem in your life amen is in the word I believe that with all my heart otherwise amen God wouldn't have given us a a complete full word that's right amen and it's been it's been revealed in this day amen so he not just gave us the word he gave us a revealed word in this hour amen through a prophet in this day praise the Lord amen that's right so you have no excuse in this hour Amen to not come to church you have no excuse in this hour Amen to not get happy about God you have no excuse in this hour Amen to not serve God Amen especially in the hour that we're living in amen with the condition that this world is in it's falling apart don't you fall apart with it amen don't you and I fall apart with it amen as the lady said one time I ain't got time for that I've I've I've come too far Amen to do to come to fall apart with the world Amen I've come too far Amen to fall apart amen with the systems of the world Amen everybody else is dying everybody else wants to stay at our church and and be lazy amen that's fine that's right I'm not going to do it and you shouldn't do it you young people don't even take that example amen and I'm going to read here right here where brother Brandon says this you should be ashamed of yourself for not coming to church so what he said I didn't say it he said it and so he says here so we find out that it's the same thing and she'll do do just exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day who the bride right she won't be a Le not not by no means uh not by no means a lukewarm but she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on in the spirit of God Amen she'll be moving on in the spirit of God just as that fire had to keep burning keep moving on Amen the Bri keeps moving on Amen praise the Lord Jesus so I I have here uh young people and and if you want I can make copies of this and you could take it back with you and go through it read it read through all these scriptures read through the quotes but I have here five sure ways to keep the fire alive after the Youth Camp amen and you and you and you adults this applies to you too because this is your this is the word I believe we're going to the greatest Youth Camp there's ever been amen there every exist I I believe that with all my heart so uh you can harp about youth camps you get we're going to one you come against them we're going to one and we're going to have fun so if you're not having fun now I don't think you'll have fun there no you amen we're going to enjoy ourselves amen but it's got to start now praise God you got to love the word of God now in order to love it there right praise God because nothing that doesn't love the word of God isn't going to be there right I'll just tell you that right now amen you enjoy amen the word enjoy being at church enjoy being with his people enjoy Fellowship praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah there's something about that amen that that that that helps you amen when you come to the house of God Amen not only is it for you to just warm a bench which that does happen and that's wonderful the bench loves you for that but you're here also Amen to receive a blessing but also to be a blessing somebody in here needs to receive your blessing the blessing does just doesn't come from the preacher or from the Deacon or from the song leader the blessing comes from you too amen so young people we need your blessing we need you to bless us we need amen every now and then amen spark us amen with what God has given you I want to learn from you amen praise God I'm sure any any minister or any or any person a true Christian amen would say the same thing amen I'm not too high or great or big amen to not learn from you amen I want to learn amen as much as I can whether they're older than me or younger than me but if it's something that's going to help me amen I want to know right because it's going to help me be more like Christ am amen that's what a minister truly is I've said I've often said it's one that one that Rose yeah right let me just explain that there for a moment one that serves amen how many watch that the movie benur yeah do you remember the the the the the that scene uh in benur where they were rowing in the boat and that gruesome scene amen where there was arms you know limbs cut off and stuff like that anyways that's not all I remember about Ben her but but there was an accident that happened there but as as they were rowing as they were rowing they were rowing to the tune of the one of the master right and they were the the the the one that was in charge of them and he was playing the drums now the word minister in that days if you take the word back Minister Minister means one that Rose in other words one that keeps in tune with the sound of the master Bo so if the master starts being faster he he he start drawing faster amen if he goes a little slower he goes a little slower amen he's only paying attention to the sound and to the what that Master is doing and beating on that thing because he's a minister he's ministering in order to keep the boat amen afloat cuz if he stops uh rowing amen the whole boat is sunk or the whole boat goes amen so it's important amen that us amen we as ministers amen we're serving you you're not serving us I don't want you to serve me I want to serve you what can I do Amen to help you amen amen I believe that that's what a true Minister wants to do amen and the greatest Minister we've ever had amen is the Lord Jesus Christ and you know what he did he washed dirty feet and he humbled himself the god of Glory the king of Heaven amen he got down and washed the disciples dirty feet right amen and why and why is it that we can't offer ourselves in in Full Sacrifice and do whatever it takes in order to minister back to him amen amen driving in a little driving a few minutes or or a couple of minutes Amen on two two nights a week two days a week some of us can't even do that I understand if you can't if you truly can't but if you can and you won't that's right that's the difference yeah amen so five sure ways to keep the fire alive after youth camp and my goodness the fire is alive under this coat I'll tell you that yeah praise the Lord I'm having fun Saints amen you guys are are pulling really nicely amen number one give all the credit to God Amen if God gave you something amen if you if you if you've truly been changed amen give Jesus that credit amen amen you didn't do nothing to to to come to it amen it was it was it was God Amen because you it's him that draws you amen so if the Lord amen did something for you at camp or any time of your life amen give him the credit give him the glory give him to honor amen amen praise the Lord Jesus amen in 1 Corinthians 4:7 in the Contemporary English version it says this what is so special about you what do you have that you were not given and if it was given to you how can you brag amen how can you brag I I like reading it in simple terms like that amen so you can young people can understand it amen because Saints the the the camp can bring excitement amen but but the Lord amen is the the only one that can bring transformation in your life amen and and and and that's that's key amen the the camp can make you excited and it can it can start that in your life amen but it's it's a continual daily fire burning amen that brings transformation in your life amen praise the Lord and that's what we all want we want to be transformed and not conformed Amen to this world Amen but transformed John 3:27 says John replied man can receive only what is given him from Heaven praise God Romans 12:3 and as I said I can give you these and you can go through them yourself for by the grace given me I say to every one of you do not think of yourself more highly than you ought to amen but think of yourself with sober judgment according to the measure of faith God has given you amen amen praise the Lord amen don't don't don't be sad thinking that your experience that you had in camp that you left it there no that same experience comes with you cuz the word comes with you amen if and the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he's ever presentent help in the time of trouble amen so don't tie it into just one place amen it comes with you wherever you go amen Psalm 461 says God is our refuge and strength and at very present help in the time of trouble John 16:3 tells us how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth all truth praise the Lord Jesus I love that amen amen for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen as I said I think a couple of services ago amen not just guide you into all truth about about his word amen but all truth about your life amen he will show you I believe that and maybe he he maybe he he won't maybe there's things because even Paul in his walk with Christ amen there was something that was happening to him that he didn't he asked God five times I believe to take it away from him and God told him he said my grace is sufficient and I don't need to explain anything to you you just move on with my grace Paul praise God so but there's other times where things can be expl why am I like this why am I why did I go through this what happened here amen God can reveal things to you but God won't reveal things to you outside of his word amen therefore it takes for you to read the word and stay in the word praise the Lord Jesus that's amen how be it oh I would just read this brother brand says this but they never in Jehovah jyra 1961 but they never did know what it was them things because see it's not what good does it do see God gets glory and as long as we try to take glory in man then you got it all wrong right amen this is so important Amen to who are you looking at at church wherever you go who is your inspiration is it the Lord Jesus Christ or is it the man behind the pulpit or is it who who is it it should be the Lord Jesus Christ amen The Man Behind the pulpit can can go right he may not be here with us all the time but who's going to be your inspiration after that right so you have to have inspiration amen by God amen amen he be your inspiration amen cuz he he's he's the one that promised that he would be with you amen The Man Behind the pulpit can't be with you forever The Man Behind the pulpit will be with him at some point in time but he can't be with you but the Holy Ghost can amen praise the Lord Jesus so don't pin it all on just the one man pin it all on the Christ the son of man because then he'll help you praise the Lord Jesus let brother brandom stay out of it he says here I'm just skipping it here I seen the Lord Jesus Christ and he laid his hands on me I put my hands on him I wasn't even in the prayer line I just sat there and believed and he turned brother Brandon around and said so and so there you are that's it that's the real thing amen praise the Lord Jesus not knocking prayer lines that's right praise the Lord that's not what he trying to do amen but God does it the way he wants to do it because he knows what you need he might he might he he he might know he might see our young people amen they need something physical you can't take that away from them some of us might might be able to sit at our seats and believe it right you've you've grown into that our young peoples are not at that point therefore we can't criticize when there is prayer lines or when there is things like that we have to stay balanced because that's what they need later on let them grow to to where they can receive it from their seat then praise God so you have to amen you have to keep things in Balance amen because they we're all growing in different in different levels amen praise the Lord Jesus and number two all right we're moving quickly fall in love with going to church and I already talked a little bit about this but we just going to talk about it a little bit more amen because uh you know your church probably doesn't match up with what happened at Camp right hey the the the music is probably not the same the the the the the the style of preaching is probably not the same amen but it doesn't mean that it's not part of the word that's right that's right amen it's a it's your church that God has given you that's where God put you and therefore amen you should fall in love with it because it's not about the man and it's not about the ministry it's about the word I want us to understand and get that it's not about the man well I'm not rallying around a man and I'm not rallying around a group I'm rallying around this word that's why I come to church praise the Lord I come to church to receive from Jesus Christ praise God Amen but see it's not supposed to your church is not supposed to match what happens at Camp amen because it you have to be able to overcome in your daily routines oh but if if if if my atmosphere daily amen was just like if as it was in Camp oh that would be wonderful yeah right say Rachel that' be that'd be excellent I mean I I tuned in I just I was enjoying myself just just tuning in but it's not so what are you going to do about it it's your soul amen amen we we the the the church can't match the same atmosphere amen but you can bring that atmosphere here praise the Lord you can bring that there the the the the the power of the Holy Ghost down by the way you live by by you staying lit right right amen by keeping that that that fire burning in your life we'll be able to feel some of that amen we'll be able to see it we'll be able to feel that heat radiating from you praise the Lord Jesus amen amen see this the the the camp it's a special event but going to church is part of your daily life brother amen and I'm not talking about just a physical building amen I'm talking about you making an altar even at your house in your prayer closet that could be your church right there am me when you're when Church doors are not open you see amen make your prayer closet or wherever you feel led Amen to pray read the word make that amen happen amen and not just wait till Wednesday not just wait till Sunday Amen to to receive word you stay in the word yourself amen Hebrews 10:23 says like this let us hold fast the confession of Our Hope without wavering amen for he who promised is faithful don't waver you came back excited don't waver keep that amen keep keep keep that experience in mind amen but amen but move on Amen I've got to have more of those experiences amen God is still alive God is still here with me he he promised that he would be with me amen and not just at the at the camp amen he said that he would hear be here with me and I must keep that going praise the Lord Jesus amen and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works amen very very important that we do that in this hour amen I'm so glad amen that the word that's been going forth lately it's been stirring us to do that Amen to treat each other in a different way to to look at each other in a different way instead of making fun of each other and and cutting up all the time Amen to treat each other with love amen not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day Drawing Near all the more amen there was people staying out of church even then at Paul's time oh yeah amen praise God how much more today but yet Paul says that it's in this day that you need to be more at church more that you see the day coming I mean not for my benefit you're not coming to church to see me I mean that's between you and God brother Wade that's brother Wade's not going to give you brownie points amen that's between you and God Amen that's between you and your soul because I'm going to read this here where brother brandham Tai is going to church with how much you love God Amen we have to realize that there are people in your church amen that are older and that can help guide you amen spiritually look what brother Braham says here in the message the every presentent water from the Rock and I apologize for reading too much quotes but uh man we believe God sent a prophet amen so I like it when he he says it amen and when the word says it amen yep right but when you really hang on to every word as the spirit gave you warning this morning see hanging on to every word that might be what he has been talking to you about holding on that's what I'm saying young people hold on hold fast it's eternal life every word of God it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance amen under any circumstance I say it he said it he did amen under any circumstance as long as you're around to be able to do so that's right brother right watch what he says whether it's hot cold indifferent like the people are indifferent whether the people are fussing or growling or you think someone there doesn't like you whatever they are doing it's still a joy to hear the word of the Lord amen it's still a joy it's one thing listening to it amen through through through through through you know live streaming or or pre-record re uh a recording but it's another thing to be there present and and and and get get it fresh out of the oven when it comes out and you can eat it amen amen or you know that's when it's better that's when it tastes better I don't see how people can do it amen praise God it's still a joy to hear the word of the Lord Dan you're in watch what he says here then then when when you're going to church then you're in love then with Christ see you love to go to church see when you're in love with Christ you love going to church now you can go to Church there's two different things amen you you you can go to church but then there's another thing to love going to church it's two different things amen you can go to church and yet not wa to be there want to be there but you're forced to be there so you you but then there's another thing Amen to love going to church you love it because why you love God Amen you love Jesus amen well honey here it's Sunday morning again I guess we have to wash up the youngans and get down there see my it's boresome see you're not in love amen you're not in love but if you are really in love you just can't wait till Sunday Morning Comes Amen brother brandham said that amen you've just got to get down there with them amen amen and we get in get and to leave the people of God they don't bore you amen the people of God don't bore you I'm saying this for our young people can listen amen do the people of God bore you do the services bore you amen and that means there's something wrong with you something wrong with you spiritually because if you're in love with Christ that's not what's supposed to happen and so young people amen you come out after Camp amen you want to keep the fire lit want to keep the fire going fall in love come into church fall in love coming to church the people of God they don't bore you why they they they are brothers and sisters amen abely amen so brother brandom M qu's fallen in love with Christ with going to church we just read it right right and and he said continues to say here and some of you people that don't go to church shame on you amen I don't know what the take people would say about this quote it's the the prophet that they say that they believe and what would they do with this quote right because when you stay home and play a tape that's not church no that's just listening to a sermon that's just that's I can do that too I could do it in the car I could do it in the office I could do it anywhere so is am I supposed to make that church amen church is coming and meeting amen because it's what Paul amen said in his word to do amen go to church about once a year and that's on Easter to show your pretty hat that's right but you know what you God deserves the first place amen Jesus ought to have the first place in every life amen amen but we give him about the fourth place he deserves the first place you say you believe this this this message amen I want you to explain that quote to me then right and you don't come to church it's for your own benefit it's not for mine amen it's for your own benefit all right how to keep this fire burning amen we got a couple more minutes amen number three recognize your weak areas right recognize your weak areas amen you know where God where Satan punches you the most you know where Satan amen drags you and tempts you with the most amen so you got to keep those things covered amen amen just like a boxer amen he has to keep those areas covered more amen because if the if if if the uh if his opponent has studied him amen he knows where where those weak areas are that's where he's going to punch more cuz that's where he has the most opportunity to get you down you see and so those are the things that you have to keep in check covered after the camp meeting amen all right number one give God all the credit number two fall in love with church number three recognize your weak areas amen acknowledge the weak areas in your life amen because Satan's going to do whatever he can to punch those areas Prophet says it like this now Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on Earth just remember that you'll never have a time but what there's a punching going on all the time I feel the punching amen I but and I got to keep those areas covered under the word of God Amen with the word that's right that's what that's what's going to keep those areas covered amen amen what what does that mean how can I apply that to my life that means amen find that scripture that's going to help you in the time of Temptation find that that that quote or or that that that that chapter in the Bible do something or or just do what the Paul said to do flee from Temptation flee just run do whatever it takes run I don't care who's looking at me run Budd run from Temptation am am it woke some of you [Laughter] up [Music] run Paul didn't say tiptoe away from Temptation no he said flee from Temptation that means get away Escape run amen amen if that's the only way for you to to to uh keep those weak areas covered in your life you know what bothers you the most amen I'm speaking some of us are some of the uh uh they're watching live too you know what bothers you the most so do whatever it takes to get out of the room that's right do whatever you feel that thing coming on you amen run go to your parents run get outside jog do something get in the word amen do something different amen like what brother Wade always said amen you you're you're stingy you don't want to you don't like to give money amen how do you get rid of that Amen in your life do the opposite give away money you you you you want to learn how to do the opposite be something else amen be the opposite of what you're struggling with do that opposite thing amen right amen praise God that's what's going to help you amen right it's hard sometimes cuz cuz somebody said one time the flesh don't play brother Joe knows who I'm talking about the flesh don't play the flesh wants the the flesh wants it but what is your soul saying if there's an experience that you had with God Amen follow what that experience amen is what what that Christ amen that fire that's in you saying follow me I'll help you through this just stay with my word amen Bible says here be sober be vigilant 1 Peter 5'8 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour Satan does a better job amen than we do our jobs he's always doing what he's supposed to do yep he outdo us most of the time he's he's focused and we've got to stay focused on him Amen on the on the word keeping those areas covered in our life James 4:7 in the Contemporary English version says this surrender to God resist the devil and he will run from you yes amen amen you run from him and he's like well I'm running from him too yeah Satan won't be know what to do with you he he'll even hate when you start getting out of bed like my goodness he's getting up again right I can't do nothing with him I can't do nothing with her come on and they're picking up that bible no no that Bible's got power that Bible does something to them that Bible causes them to get excited about God and and and and and they everything I throw at them amen they just y y he won't know what to do with you then he'll have to run praise the Lord Ephesians 611 says this put on all the armor of God all the armor of God all of it that God gives so you can defend yourself against the devil's tricks amen amen don't get so prideful that you think you're you're immune from from falling amen don't think don't think that the don't I can hand this I could I can I can I can walk on the edge it's okay yeah it's all right you run Rong step and I'll probably break my foot so I better not do that 43 years old I told I told my my nieces the other day I uh uh we was I was at the house we was kind of cleaning up some cardboard um boxes and stuff and and you know how you fold cardboard boxes up you know you break them down and I was we was up at the top of the stairs and oh my those cardboard boxes look look good to slide down I just I wanted to my wife didn't know this I wanted to but then I said wait a second I'm 43 years old I got a family I got to keep going I can't break my neck right now can't do that so we're here use wisdom sometimes right got to use wisdom amen amen 1 Corinthians 10:12 says this even if you think you can stand up to Temptation be careful not to fall if you if you think you could do it don't even go there no just just stay away from it cuz it's if it was a Temptation before it's going to be a Temptation again right it's going to be a Temptation again amen number four we're moving on here find Good Company amen find friends good company good friends that you can learn from that you can grow with that you can pray with that you can amen that you can uh uh uh uh just grow together and that you can sharpen one another as the Bible says iron sharpens iron amen make sure to have positive influences in your life amen and if you don't have any influences in your life then find some if you don't have good influences in your life find them and I I think the first place to go is church that you can start right there amen amen find those positive influences in your life that you can learn from and that you know that when you're around that person your spirit isn't going to be downtrodden you're not going to be sitting there and just be made fun of you're you're going to learn something from that person find those good influences in your life amen amen amen don't don't try to make it alone no none of us can make it alone God didn't make us Amen to make it alone God didn't make us to be Islands to ourselves if that was the case he would have just made us and put us in bubbles like they were trying to do back in 2020 amen that doesn't work that totally goes against what God made Humanity to be amen you can't be a bubble to yourself it's tempting to do so sometimes it's because people people get on your nerves right and sometimes we get on our nerves to to people and then you don't know that brother the boy you get on somebody's nerves I [Laughter] don't right but you that is the way to cope with those things is to be around people and have positive influences in your life amen praise God 1 Corinthians tells us this do not be deceived evil company corrupts good habits in other words bad friends bad people it corrupts what you've learned amen through your life amen it corrupts you it'll corrupt you a bad apple in a in in a good in a good batch eventually corrupts the whole batch right yeah just one bad apple right one bad friend in your life will eventually corrupt you so you've got to be you've got to watch that Proverbs 13:20 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise all right but a companion of fools shall be destroyed in other words wise friends make you wise but you hurt yourself by going around with fools righten you're hurting yourself by going around with foolish people right amen Amen brother if somebody's always got the word talking about the word of God and praying and and you see you could see it in people amen gravitate towards that person yeah amen see what you can learn amen or maybe you know that'll be a good friend to have keep it keeping good friends amen comes back to being at church for Fellowship amen it it just does that that's where you can start amen and in Proverbs 27:17 it says as iron sharpens iron so a friend sharpens a friend amen what does that mean it means you help one another amen amen iron helps to Sharp iron amen praise the Lord and going on quickly here Sam brother Brown says this Samson got into Bad Company and you always can remember that when you are in Bad Company you are out of the will of the Lord all right my old southern mam used to tell me if you lay down with a dog that's got fleas you'll get up with the fleas it's just common sense that's a rather rude expression but it's it's a good all lot of common everyday sense to it you just can't associate yourself with the things of the world and expect to stay spiritual and humble before the Lord right you're known by your company there's an old saying show me your company and I'll tell you who you are and when the church begins to keep company with the world and it's no more than the world it gets out of the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit gets out of the company of God and and of angels and of God's Heritage when it begins to flirt as Samson did amen amen amen amen so who is someone that that that that you can turn to amen that can help you be that influence amen that can help you be like Christ find that person amen talk with that person Amen to influence one another and pray together read the word of God together amen do that amen flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness in second Timothy 2:22 Faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of the Pure Heart in other words run from Temptations amen that capture young people always do the right thing be faithful loving watch this and easy to get along with amen ah worship with people whose hearts are pure praise the Lord amen yeah thank you Lord got to in order to keep this fire going and last one here and we'll be closing number five amen create a plan for growth amen amen remember that fire had to keep keep going right amen y man because young people the the the experience that you've had there at Camp amen much of what happened there was because the word of God you were exposed to the word of God right right a lot of the word of God was being exposed amen but I I've got good news the word of God goes home with you the word of God didn't stay over there the Bible comes home with you amen so that so you amen can continue that same exposure amen open the word of God read the word of God if it's digital format so be it it's the word praise the Lord but just get in it cuz it's not going to harm you it's only going to benefit you praise the Lord John said 1717 sanctify them through thy truth Jesus speaking Thy word is truth Thy word is truth his truth amen his word is truth and Joshua 1 18 says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth amen why thy mouth because you're supposed to be eating it all the time just like some of you just just pop in amen a tackies in your mouth all the time and and pop in sour candy like I do and uh you know sour gummy worms and all that all the time you're always munching amen just think man if I could do the same thing with the word of God man I'm growing physically but I could grow spiritually if I stay in the word if I'm always popping it in in my mouth right but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then for for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous for then Thou shalt have full victory over your your your the the Devils that come and torment you amen through the Worden praise God Amen and then Thou shalt have good success that's right amen God will show you his perfect will for your life through his word I believe that all the answers of your life they're laying in the word of God Psalm 1 1-2 says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stand endeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord his Delight in other words what you are enjoying what is tasty to you is the law of the Lord right and is and in his law doth he meditate on Wednesday nights oh on Sunday morning Sunday morning only though brother no it doesn't say that says day and night amen right day and night amen praise the Lord amen God keeps his word brother BR says this so children back to your God quickly amen don't tangle with the world for anything right young people don't tangle with the world don't tangle amen something was was tangling you and and causing you you you ever had a cord that's been Tangled you know your headphones you know that you use and can't get this thing on Tangled so I'm going to buy me some expensive earbuds then cuz I can't untangle all right don't tangle yourself that way with the world cuz it's hard to get out amen it it can be done but it's hard amen God can get you out God can untangle the the the knots in your life untangle them amen but don't you don't have to tangle yourself with the world stay out of this modern world stay out of these modern theologies just look to the Lamb of God read your Bible and pray all the time this is brother Brandon saying the prophet you say you believe don't be weary be rejoicing and happy amen amen for the Redemption of the church is drawing nigh when we shall see him who died for us how much do you really mean it brother Ram says don't play now th this is not a play time this is a receiving time this is a time that you must get it come dump it out right now will you come give it all you got to God say God I ain't got very much I'm just a little housewife I can't do very much Lord but I can read your Bible I can pray every day I can throw out all the trash that's in my mind all the trash that comes in our mind on a daily basis right you have an opportunity on Sunday Wednesdays every day to throw it out amen I can throw all that stuff out I'm guilty of a lot of things that preacher said this morning so I'm dumping it out today I don't want it God fill me with love amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so those are five ways that you can that can help you Amen to keep the fire amen going after Camp y amen let me tell you what Saints you know and brother Wade read it this this past Sunday amen but you know that the disciples and Jesus when they went to mount Transfiguration they had a little camp meeting there did you know that you know we know all the all all that that that represents and and but but but you know it was a little camp meeting for them and Jesus personally invited them to go to the camp Meeting those three disciples I was three or four disciples I can't remember Peter James and John I believe amen three and Jesus transfigures himself in other words changes before him before them amen praise God they didn't even know amen Jesus did all that for them and they get excited they get excited about God and they say and they say Lord because Elijah and and Moses they appear as well amen they even joined the camp meeting they even wanted to join that camp meeting was so good I mean everything was I mean they was having a good time it excited amen uh uh Peter and they say let's let's make three Tabernacles here one for you Jesus one for you Elijah and one for for Moses and it got him excited amen and all of a sudden amen the the voice comes out and says this is my beloved son hear ye him amen it ain't not about you Peter it's not about what you want and it's not about Moses all about Moses it's not about all about Elijah it's about the Lord Jesus Christ he is the one that you need to keep your eyes focused on Amen the Bible says amen that they got scared amen they were terrified when they heard that voice amen but then Jesus amen comes up and and opens up and says there was nobody left but Jesus and says fear not I'm here amen but he says don't tell this to anybody no and they went down the they went down the mountain back to the mountain and I bet you Peter amen it was it was a quiet walk back down the mountain I'm sure man I did we just see what we just saw I mean Jesus am man he had white vestures a cloud around him amen just like your brother said ain't nobody going to believe us we ain't how who are we going to tell this about to to what are we going to say but see it was their own experience but let me tell you what they saw great things up in that up in that camp meeting yeah but it's still they still had to continue walking with Jesus in order to get to Pentecost to receive the Holy Ghost to be born again that experience as good as it was and as everything that they saw Jesus transfigured before they still had to be born again so let me tell you Saints young people you went to the camp meeting you got to make sure no matter what you felt no matter how good you felt how much you jumped how much you shouted that is all good that is the you needed that so that you can continue on to go get the new birth maybe you did get the new birth there but only that's between you and God that experience amen that Peter and the disciples receiv received that was only between them and Jesus that's why Jesus said don't tell this to nobody until the the son of man be risen from the dead again amen that was between them and God Amen and so what you experienced was between you and God but keep that thing going do you you you you see Peter and the disciples they had to keep that going and I'm sure they would never they never probably stopped thinking about that it took them amen that that that's that that probably that thing held Peter even though he he he he denied the Lord three times even even though amen he he did he tried to back away from even serving from I'm going back fishing but he probably would thought think about but I saw him transfigured I even saw Moses and Elijah there with him amen how can I leave this word where else can I go he's the only one that has the word of eternal life amen Jesus knew that about Peter amen and therefore amen he was able to go up to the upper room yes sir and receive the promise of God personally so he wasn't now just looking at the Jesus before them but now is Jesus amen inside of them by the by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's what's the best amen that's what will keep you amen that's the true experience amen the the the the indwelling of the holy spirit because if we could see Jesus we could see lights we could see all kinds of stuff that but that won't save you though that didn't save Peter but it's the indwelling of the Holy Ghost that's what will keep you so young people amen keep the fire lit amen keep it alive keep putting that wood in it amen and I promise you you'll be become more like that fire that's right and who is that fire amen the Lord Jesus Christ he is the consuming fire amen let's stand to our feet praise the Lord Jesus let's have the musicians come amen praise God Amen let's let's just sing this song key of f if if if you know how to you know sister take up your
