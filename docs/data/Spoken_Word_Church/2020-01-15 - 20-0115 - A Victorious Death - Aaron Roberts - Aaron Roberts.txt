[Music] amen god bless you tonight appreciate the Lord may sing later promises promises yes amen good to be on the house of the Lord could be a Christian thank the Lord for all that he's done for us it's one thing there's me there's many needs and seems like every day you're hearing more and more people requesting prayer for different things but one thing about it God meets every every need you know he knows our needs before we pray he has an answer before we pray state faux-fur Oh God they can answer our prayers and knows what we have Nita and gives it to us and sometimes it's it gives us our needs and not our walls sometimes we don't know what we need but he does know what we need amen let's just all bow our heads and speak the lord before we get into the scripture we're gonna be reading from the book of Judges chapter 13 all bow our heads and pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful for Lord for you and for another opportunity to be in your house Lord

from the mind of God Lord and father it's just piqued our hearts Lord and Lord to minister to us in a special way Lord to give us what we have need of in this hour Lord Lord we're incapable of doing it but we know that you are the one that can come on the scene and meet each one Lord and just give us the unction of the Holy Ghost to speak or what people need Lord or not just to be speaking from just speaking out of the Bible Lord because the the scripture says that the letter killeth Lord but it takes the Spirit Lord to give us life and that's what we desire Lord more of you mortal eternal

Jesus Christ standing in flesh again Lord Jesus Lord what you promised in your word Lord we just pray that you come and do it tonight Lord for each need that's represented in this building Lord use you know each one Lord it would it takes too much time Lord to mention all the names Lord Jesus but you know each heart in each life Lord you know what each name that's been being mentioned Lord and Lord you know what their needs are and finally we know why they've contacted us Lord and asked for a prayer Lord because we know that you know that that we we have a communication Lord we have a fellowship with you Lord and it's and it's visible through the people Horta we can see that Lord that we can touch heaven Lord because heaven has come down to us Lord and we can fellowship with you

than he that's in the world if I we just pray tonight Lord just help us get out of the way minister to each one i knowing us my dalou blessed of the little bride around the world Lord for each one that has a need Lord nor desire as I the request came in from the brother Lord that was speaking about their needing a place to meet and lord we we know that before they even asked Lord JRE had a place and we just believe that you'll meet and just go to them and just bless them in a special way Lord we commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen judges chapter 13 and verse 1 says and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of Zorah of the family of the Danites whose name was Manoah and his wife was barren and barren and bare not and the angel the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren and Barriss not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore o beware I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing for lo thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines so we're gonna drop down to verse 24 and it says and the woman bear a son and called his name Sampson and the child grew and the Lord blessed him hey man god bless you tonight you can be seated and then we're gonna continue reading on in save time don't want you have to stay on the whole time but Judges chapter 16 we're just gonna continue on there just a few more off of me your scripture to you but you know I just want to start and lay the whole foundation here judges chapter 16 verse 23 says and the Lord's then the Lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their God and to rejoice for they said our God hath delivered sentence and our enemy into our hand and when the people saw him they praised their God and they said our God hath delivered into our hands our enemy the destroy of our country which slew many of us and it came to pass when their hearts marry these and they said call for Sampson that he may make us sport and they called for Sampson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillars and Sampson set unto the lab that held him by the hands suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that I may lean upon them now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women and beheld while Simpson made sport and Sampson called unto the Lord and said O Lord God remember me I prayed these strip than me I pray thee want only this once so God that I may may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes and the sand Sampson took hold of the two middle pillars which upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up of the - of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left and Sampson said let me die with the Philistines and he bowed himself with all of his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were there in so the death which she slew at his death so the day at which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life amen so tonight if you saw the title it's called a victory a victorious death you know most of the time when people think about a death you know most of the time that's not very victorious you know when when people think of dying and you know many times even when we look at things many poems you know it's a loss and you know they don't see that as being a victory but you know you know we see in Samson's life Sampson had a great victory but it took it took his death it took everything that he had and you know many years ago there's a there's a you know I've always been kind of partial to history I've always kind of liked history and there was a story that came out of from World War two and it's always stuck with me and that's one of my one of my favorite stories that come from that from the Allies and in 1943 we if you if you know much about the war at Point the Allies wanted to invade from North Africa they wanted to invade into Europe and and so one of the areas that they were going to have to go into was Italy because that was the way that they were going to breach in to Europe and when when allies had moved into the north and North Africa you know the not seasoned the Germans knew where their allies were headed because they knew the landscape and they knew where they would end up so that's the route they went and they fortified Sicily because that was the most logical place that you would bring in your troops well the Allies were needing that place for the invasion they needed to clear that out so they found a man that were that had died and this man and if you can read about it I I don't have his have his name but this man who was committed suicide this man felt like that he had he would never accomplish anything in his life and he killed himself and one of the things that he had was he ended up with like pneumonia had a lot of fluid in his lungs and because of that they they used his body the British government took his body and they dressed him up as a soldier and they as an officer and they put these plans and all this correspondence and stuff in his in his clothing and in his satchel and everything and they took him and they dropped him off of this coast of Spain because they knew that Spain was supposed to be neutral but they knew that they would get the information to the Nazis so they they drop this dead man out in the water because he had all that fluid in his lungs it looked like he drowned that's exactly what the British government said here's this captain in our in our military that had drowned and they took all these papers well mi5 had taken all the papers that he had and they coded them and they knew when they were gonna get copied well a Spanish took them they give them to the Nazis the Nazi made copy of them and give them back to the British the British got him they scanned them and they realized that the Nazis had made copies of the plans well their plan was to invade Greece and Sardinia they weren't going to and so a lie started moving their forces to the right place Hitler was convinced that they had left Sicily they had scrapped the the invasion of Sicily they were going to go a different way well Hitler had numerous generals kept telling him this is a bad plan but Hitler was convinced this was right so he went over there and moved all his forces to the right spot and when the time come the Americans and the Allies invaded Sicily and the thing is is it cleared it out we'd almost less people when we invaded Sicily because the plan had worked and they had moved all of the forces out of the way but you know it was so amazing and you say why are you telling it you know but what was so amazing about this was they took a man and this man who in his whole entire life this man didn't believe that he could ever accomplish anything here's a man that that killed himself and he didn't think he had anything to live for but you know what happened when he died he became extremely valuable to the deliverance of Europe but the problem was he never saw that but you know what it took it took his death to get him out of the way so that he could be used for a greater plan and you and I brothers and sisters the thing is is I want us to understand that sometimes that's what he takes it takes a for us to get out of the way because what holds up the plan of God is us getting out of the way and here's this man who never felt like he'd ever accomplished anything in his life but you know what he done when he died they were able to use him to take a message a message to be delivered to the people and you know what the scripture tells us that that this is a message of deliverance but to others it's a message of damnation they were going to take this and they're not going to believe it they're going to do whatever they will with it but the message would will accomplish exactly what it was sent for the message was sent to and in the the message came that it was going to be in deliverance but you know what to those who it's damnation its damnation but to those who are it's deliverance it's deliverance to those that it's eternal life its eternal life but here's this man who didn't think he would do anything but you know what would he died he was able to be used and you know what many people think you know what can I do my life is like it's so low and so insignificant it doesn't really amount to anything but you know what if you'll ever died out to Jesus Christ and let him come on the scene and let him it's no longer either but it's Christ that liveth in me then you can see miracles take place you can see the supernatural people want to know where the supernatural is well you know what he takes place in humans and just everyday living and God comes on the scene and he'll meet you well because it's not a public show people come to church God come to speak someone and people get delivers and people get held and the next one sits there like a bump on a pickle and they don't get anything but see God come on the scene but he's here to meet your needs to do to give whatever you have need of and here in there in our scripture we see Samson Samson was born to be a deliverer Samson was born with a perp he was born with a commission he was prophesied to do something and you know my brothers and sisters we work - this is from the message just once more Lord 1963 I think is number one brother Browns speaking he says you brought this to my memory of this great man that wants to live for you in the condition he got in the fatherís Samson was willing to die die out to himself died with his enemy to bring God's victory and promise back mamie with all our church entity and all our difference doubts our own thinking and accept your word die out to the thoughts that we've been told the days of miracles and it's past that when we know that the that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever so we can you know for us to die out to our own thinking that we can come and realize that God is the same yesterday today and forever to bring forth God's victory because you know that's what that's what Samson was to do Samson was purposed in life to have a purpose because the scripture tells us that when the when the forty years that the Philistines that Israel was in the hands of the Philistines that God sent them a deliverer to come on the scene and he was supposed to raise up and he was supposed to destroy the Philistines he was supposed to overcome them and you know and he was given this commission and all the things that God done in his life you know what he he had a covenant with God and he had the power to do the things that God called him to do but the problem was he never got to the place that he was completely sold out to God that he would that God was totally able to use him and he failed in what he was doing but it took a but it took his death to come to the great victory that he was warning that God purposed to him and brothers and sisters we have been we have been purposed - a great victory in our our we've been given a great Commission in our our we've been given this commission you because as the scripture tells us you know we're to go into all the world and preach the gospel to everything to each one because we're supposed to demonstrate the power that's in the scripture to everyone why because Jesus came in flesh to do exactly that and he said he said whatever I do you shall do also and greater than this how you do so he came and he demonstrated to us and he talked about even in the Garden of Gethsemane and when when he was tempted even even in the wilderness when he was tempted by the devil he showed that he could overcome by the word and he said he'd give that to the weakness Christian because even the weakest Christian could do the exact same thing take the exact same word and overcome the devil well because he's seen that take place before and you know what you and I've been given that same Commission to do the same thing to overcome the devil to overcome every power of the enemy in this hour here's a great man you know because lots of lots of times we don't think and we have to come to this realization you know because sometimes we're gonna wake their selves they shake ourselves every day to realize who we are because we allow we allowed that Satan to come and he and he wants to take a route and in our lives and take hold in our lives and he wants to squat be a squatter on our property and sometimes we allow him to do it you know you know as brother Evan was talking about Samson he said you all Samson's life he became such a great man that we rose up he said y'all he put fear in the hearts of the flesh States just at the mention of his name they just mentioned Sam says they people feared him they didn't won't have anything to do with him but you know what he was the one because he was fortified behind the word he was fortified behind a promise a covenant that God had given him and you know what you and our same thing we're weird fortified behind the world we're fortified behind the Covenant that God has given us and brothers and sisters as long as we stay behind that word there's nothing that can overcome us but you know the problem is is we don't were just like Samson sometimes we don't mind getting a little worldliness in or little things move and getting getting a little wax in our inner and our Christian walk and our Christian experience and we don't have the fervor and we don't have the zeal as as brother Wade was talking about we're lacking these things in what the devil is allowed to be allowed to creep in and it all of a sudden we wonder why we don't have the victory while we don't have Joel wonder while these things like why because we've allowed it to happen because as brother Branham was talking about you can imagine you know having a great big bank account and having lots of money and if people walk around wonder about you know how am I going to pay my bills or how about you know how am I going to eat you know what are we gonna do well you know I don't know about y'all but you know my boys you know they don't know my one bit coming to me daddy and it's just you know they don't they don't mind one bit got them hands up but you know what there's people there's people well lord if it be your wheel well let's see God put it in the word that he said that he that he Paul said that he prayed that you'd prosper and be in health even as your soul prospers he said my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory because what the scripture said Haven said prove me and try me and say if I won't open the windows of heaven David tells us that he heals all our sin our diseases and all of our afflictions he's forgiven all of our sins and our iniquities so you know what we have been forgiven but you know what it's there for us because that's a great big bank account that great in solve inexhaustible fountain of life their brother Bram talks about that you you know that little fish you know well you know I may have to drink sparingly I may run out or you had this great big bank account well that you have all these things well you know he said it's a he said it's a bank draft of heaven you know what he said he said it's all he's got everything he owns the cattle on a Thousand Hill all day all things were created by him and were for him and he said it was his good pleasure to give you the kingdom to give you all that you have need of and we wonder the Lord is this your wheel you know sometimes you have to sit and think you know if I had a need there's people I know I know brother Dale would give me anything that I did if he could help me and he knew I was in need he'd give me everything that he had he'd do anything he could for me but you know what he's a man hey so but you know how much greater is our Heavenly Father when we well he knows everything that you have Nita before you even ask for it he knows what you have need of and you know what he's already got it planned out you know what he David said I've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread you know he's never failed us and as you know if you go back through your life and you sit down and you think you know you need to you need to sit down and write down the things that God has done for you the things that you've seen God do in your life you know you need to hang that on the wall and look at it sometimes you know because sometimes if you start down and start it right now you start down writing down all your problems everything that you got wrong and everything and you start writing down all your blessings and all the things God done for you then you know what all of a sudden you don't think about the problems that you got you're all of a sudden it's like what do I have over here because you know what you're still writing all the blessings and all the things got into all the miracles that you've seen done in your life over here but you know what sometimes all we do is focus on the problems we always focus on this side over here we say you know what are you gonna do and then we worry about all this over you know what God's done all this for us well if he's done all that you know what he's gonna take care of the rest of it too you know because if God has given us eternal life if he's giving us the baptism of the Holy Ghost if we're born again and we're of the seed of God and we are the children of God and we are we are Jesus Christ on the earth then you know what whatever he has according to the scripture we're joint heirs with Christ whatever Christ has we have also so you know what it's not like you know we're having to worry about it and try to struggle and press all these things why because it's already there but the problem is is we're just like Samson many times we get in our own way we're always getting in the way of God we don't surrender to him and say Lord come on the scene and just have your will in your way because we want to do it the way that we want to do it we want it to happen the way that we want to happen and if you don't come my way and if it don't just stroke me just the right way just like a catch you know padding it padding it and pending we don't go the right way you know we get all upset but you know what that's what God wants us to do he wants us to grow up and be rugged Christians he wants us to be people that can stand our own feet not be little babies we let our we let our vision we let our things that happen to us hold us back Luke chapter 10 verse 19 says Jesus speaking he says behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you so he's given you the power over all the powers of the enemy so you know what he's already defeated when it before he even comes to bring to attack you to even try to come against you he's already defeated he's already because he's already defeated one because we have the word but the problem is is we don't we don't believe that we don't believe that he's already defeated you know it's just like you know if you if you had something you know you say these people is that's got property or whatever you know and they they know it's theirs and they've got a claim on it you know what they don't mind well you know I should say this some people will let people just walk all over them and take everything they got and they don't they just go and smile but there's other people in the world you know what if it belongs to them and you got it you better get going because you know what they're coming to get it if you got it next thing you know they're calling the law and they bring their they bring their their papers and they bring their court orders and everything and they don't mind walking down there and say listen Jack that's mine and you got to go and the officers are right here they will help you leave this property or they will drag you off kicking and screaming but you're gone and you know what that's what you have to do to the devil when he comes your way you can stand out there and hold the word up and say you know what you got no place to be here you've got no right to be here you are defeated you've got no place to be here here's the word and the Holy Ghost is sent to enforce the word he's the he is the enforcer so if the word has been given to us then you know what he's got to go but you know what you've got to claim that and believe that and stand there and can and be convinced of it until he leaves but you know what if we just stand here one time and say well by a stripes I'm healed and then all of a sudden you know when it gets worse and we don't get healed and we're okay for a while and then it comes back there's like well I guess I wasn't healed no you know what you got to kick that devil out again if he comes along one time he don't mind trying to come back but you know what if he filled you one time then you know what he can hear you again you always was heal but you know he'll keep coming back and all of a sudden you know you go to the doctor and everything looks good one month and the next time you go back the next month and everything looks bad well you know what God's Word didn't change the doctors test might have changed but God's Word didn't change what he said about you is still the same so if he said you is healed no matter what the test says you're still healed that devil still defeated if we can just believe what God said you know as as Samson here's a great man giving this Great Commission to defeat this enemy that had bound and harass the people of God all those years and you know he was given a Great Commission to overcome and you know what and he was able to he was able to do great feats through the strength of God and and seem to all the miracles that had happened in his life and all those things but you know what it didn't come to the place that it ought to have because he did not do what he was supposed to do because it was a thing that he was supposed to do and that was to overcome all the powers of the enemy but he didn't because he wanted to do his own thing and you know as he went along you know God was able to do a lot of great things to his life but you know what there came a time then when it came to the greatest battle he'd failed because he didn't stay with where he should have been you know there's when he came along you know there was Delilah you know we seen all the things that had happened in his life but you know what he got to a place in his life where you know what he was supposed to stay away from the enemy but you know what hail out he allowed the enemy to come in the enemy was able to come in for a little bit and and she was able to do her thing she was able to work her charms and you know he was in hey Lenny listen to what she had to say but you know what he should have never had anything to do with and here it was you know he'd seen all that they had done you know when you see that when you see the devil you know and you try to picture this here's here's that here's the people of God here's here's Israel and here they are being killed and and all the things that they had to go through under the bondage of the Philistines all those years and you know ever since Samson was young he was told you're gonna be the deliverer you know here you're God's anointed you to do something you know he was called to this and you know what no doubt he had seen the destruction he had seen the damage that the Philistines had done and yet he didn't he didn't stay away from it when you see what what the destruction and all the things that the devil has done to you when you've seen how many things that went wrong in your life and all these things and you know what and you still don't mind him sitting on your shoulder talking in your ear and here he was and when all of this was going on and here Samson was when he knew to stay away from that you're supposed to utterly destroy that but you know what he came along brother Bram said you know here was Delilah bringing her you know her whilst good looking woman come along you know turned his head well he didn't mind hanging out with her but you know what that was his problem he had a pretty face and she could talk to him the right way and Stroke him just the right way and he just he just was infatuated he was just in love and he just just just brought him right to the place you know and you know what he had he had a commission he had a secret nobody knew where he strength loved he had a strength from God he had a covenant from God God had given him a word to hold on to and yet do you know that when Delilah came to him he played it off like it was a joke like it was just like it was just a joke after he'd seen all the destruction and mayhem and everything that the Philistines had done to the children of Israel and knowing he was the one to destroy them to destroy the works of the enemy and you know what if we say God has called us to destroy the works of the enemy he's called you to destroy the works of the enemy you know what when there's there's there's sickness did not come from God there there's no sickness that come from God God God gave you health and it wants you to be whole but you know what when Satan comes along you know we all get old we all have problems but you know what God promised us to be healed God promised us health so you know what it doesn't matter what happened you say well all my family's diabetic great grandmother great grandfather everybody aunt Suzie and everybody else is all diabetic well you know what just because you're dying you know everybody else in the family is diabetic don't mean you have to be everybody in there's got heart disease and cholesterol to the roof and everything else you don't have to accept that I got people that people that know people you've got family members that are got mental illnesses you know schizophrenic and many depress it and all these other things and you know and people people worry about that kind of thing they got it all they get so bad well I don't know if it's gonna happen that's gonna happen well you know what the blood of Jesus Christ came to do one thing it didn't just come to save you and you struggle and and just scrape along in this life until you reach the sweet by-and-by but you know what he came and he and he took the stripes on his back that you can be healed and you can be delivered it wasn't just that we're waiting on the sweet by-and-by he's here to meet your needs right now and you know what you can go ahead and claim the pardon and the blood of Calvary to cover those needs and they don't have to be yours but you people still wonder about it they're still waiting on the sweet by-and-by I know waiting on the sweet by-and-by it's given to me and it's given to me for here to overcome its for me to be delivered here it's for me to be happy and healthy and whole here not some other time I'm not I'm not waiting for some other time why because he said by his stripes I'm healed we're gonna want hey whatever the devil brings my way I'm not going to accept it as brother joel always talks about you know your you going to accept that bottle of rattlesnakes I'm not signing for it but here was Sampson you know he didn't he after he's seen all that but you know what those pretty eyes and then that beautiful hair and everything just just pleased him so well that you know what he didn't mind hanging out with her you know what and the devil knows exactly what he needs to bring your way to overcome you you know everybody's got different things that that they weren't you know the devil knows he's so sly so he's so smart he knows exactly how to work on you but you know what he was given Satan Sampson was given a commission to overcome to destroy the works of the enemy but you know what she knew how to work on him and it was just the right one and all of a sudden you know he just couldn't he just couldn't and you know couldn't stay away just enjoyed all this time well you know what just slowly petting him and just like seing him sleep just rest and you know what and he didn't realize that he was walking down the road to defeat and he was head and right down the road that he shouldn't brother Adam said that you know God tried to correct him he wouldn't listen no I'm enjoying this that's too good too good when he knew that he had a strength he had a covenant he had a word that showed that told him that he was overcomer he had had that Nazarite vowel and then she come in there you know after all that time just loving on him and just everything so smooth and lovey and everything it's like what Samson dear where's your strength like you know what it was time for Samson dear to exit stage left and he should have left town but you know what he enjoyed playing this gang with her and you know what there's lots of people in this world they think they can play with the devil thank you they're gonna see just how close they can play with the world and get in the world you know what if you start heading that way if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God's not in you but you're gonna start heading that way just smoothly rolling that way well then he gets out there oh well if you if you if you break my hair if you bind me with cords if you do these little things here and there oh no I'm just gonna play this game with her he was playing with fire and he didn't realize just how close he was I don't know this is fine we're enjoying this lots of people think well you know it won't hurt I'll do this thing one time you know that there's many people in the world that'll tell you I've listened to him peoples like well you know what I'd never tried meth before but you know what other friends were doing it and I decided that and you know what he destroyed their life they smoked at one time and you know what they were addicted there were actually people that smoked meth and you know what they didn't do anything else in their life because it killed him you know well it was just one time well that was one time too many there's many things people think well you know what I'll just smoke one cigarette and 40 years later they're battling lung cancer well all we just smoke cigarette or are they going to take one drink of alcohol well we're going to do this or that it won't be sooo bad well the next thing you know all of a sudden they can't control it it's controlling them but you know what he went along with with the Lila's plan and he didn't realize just how close he was to destruction here he come along and all of a sudden here it was you know she just kept working on him and working on well you don't love me if you don't tell me these things I don't know why you don't tell me and all of a sudden scripture tells us that he opened up his heart and he told her everything he told her exactly he was fortified behind the word all of a sudden he was out from behind the word it's like well if he shaved my hand I've never I have a Nazarite Val razors never been on my head God's given me a covenant he's giving me strength to overcome two great feats in my life don't overcome every power of the devil it's ever coming my way seeing the people my people the people of God and bondage and God's given me a commission to overcome them and Here I am coming out from behind the Word of God playing with the devil cuz she comes along and just rocks him to sleep and he's lost all zeal and he's lost all sincerity he's lost all consideration for the word of God and he sits there and he lays in her lap and she just begins to work and there goes his power falling on the floor and you know what young people you can do that God's called you to do great feats in this world you know what you don't have you don't have to go out and and do their things that we've we've all done that there's a lot of things in our lives that you know we would hate to have to stand up here and tell anybody but you know what there's a lot of things that y'all don't have to do but you know what you'll make that decision whether you'll do it or not whether you'll overcome it and say you know what I didn't I never touched those things I never saw those things I've never partook of those things and you what you can stand up and you can testify saying you know what the grace of God's kept me the grace of God has kept me to this place that I've been able to overcome it's not me but but God has given me a commission to overcome these things but you know we can't we can just do what we want to and just come out but you know what all of a sudden here was here's what Simpson you know Sampson run for a long time doing what he wanted to and you know he you know anytime something happened you know he could just spill the anointing just come overi me but just so anointed and then he could just do whatever he wanted to but you know what one day you lost that anointing and he was standing there and Delilah said Samson Samson the Philistines be upon you was like well you know what I'll just raise up take care of them well you know what when that happened he was bound here he was bound and his eyes plucked out can you imagine a man that had been feared by these people had been able to do great amazing feats in his life had the power of God resting upon him and had having the Commission to destroy these people and all of a sudden here is Samson the great deliverer bound and being drugged through the streets bleed here yes can't see and all of a sudden here he goes dragging down the road hey Sampson we got a little thing for you over here we want you to grind some meal and here goes Sampson just pushing that thing around and around and around and around and around sitting there thinking about you know what if I'd listened to the word I wouldn't be in this mess I wouldn't be here Here I am just going around doing the enemy's work when I could be out doing what God called me to do but I'm out doing the enemy's work and you know what no doubt hey they didn't mind coming by every so often and you know harassing him could you imagine here you are just grinding along bound can't see and all of a sudden somebody comes behind kicks you somebody poked you with a stick kids over there there you are out grinding the kids out there throwing rocks at you hoho there's the great liver oh and you know what he listened to that the whole time and you know what he began to think about all the things that God had called him to do all the great feats that he had had in his life all the miracles all the things that God had called him to do and all the things he did be able to do and all the things that he couldn't do because he got in this mess but you know what the scripture tells us that the hair began to grow you know that covenant began to come back you know we've become to grow out again and here they are making fun of me making sport of him you know here they are they built this great temple this this great building to their great God Dagon oh look we've God Dagon has delivered this great enemy of ours to us and here we are and we're going to get drunk and we're gonna have fun and we're going to make sport of him and we're gonna make fun of him and we're going to make him do all kinds of tricks and everything and we're gonna throw stuff at him and we're just gonna have a great time making fun of him but you know there's one thing about it if you're a child of God if you're one of his then you know what it doesn't matter if you fall or not you know what God is still a God of mercy he's still a God of grace but you know what here he come to the lowest point in his life and and you know Kent can you imagine if you were an Israelite and here is this great deliverer and you've seen Sampson come out there and he's done all of these great miracles and he's seen all these great feats take place and you've seen all these people that has harassed your family and your grandmother and your grandfather's been through all these things and you've seen all the things that the Philistines have done to them and all of a sudden you've seen this deliverer come along and then all of a sudden the deliverer is blind and he's been beat and he's being drug around by the Philistines and you think what happened why did what happened to our great deliverer god I thought God sent us this person I thought God sent us somebody to overcome these things you know what it's not it's not you you just you don't affect you somebody you know you don't send by yourself it's you know because you affect everybody else you know what no man's an island you know all the way through the scripture we see different ones and you know they all had they the you know they thought they could just do a little something they thought everything would be all right but you know what it don't work that way just ask just look in the Bible this ask Aiken has Aikens family you know hey no we're gonna want this this little bit of gold miss Gore it'll be okay okay no you know what they took all of them out then he just kill him they killed his family they burn everything up they destroyed all of it they got all of that wickedness out of the camp and do you think you just come along you think you're just gonna stand no you know what you're gonna affect everybody else just like brother Brennan or brother Dale always tells us one when we have a child as dedicated you know you level off and it's just ain't you doing things wrong you know what you're living before other people and you're and they're seeing the life that you live and you know what you know I got if I point one finger I got three more ten at me but you know what that's the truth our children see our lives and whatever we do they see that and they know how we live and you know what that's the reason you know you know I apologize to mine you know what because you know I don't I don't live a perfect life I got faults and failures just like everybody else and you know what they say well don't look too good to me I know it does and you know we have to make that right right but you know what they was they making out there making fun of Sampson all the great things that Simpson had done this great deliverer of God had come along and here he was standing there and oh this is what you call a great deliverer oh then you call this great we just out here making fun of him he can't do nothing now but you know what that hair had grown back and you know what he said Lord he said just once more just give me this strength more time they said as it was before let it be this one time Lord just come back one more time why because Lord you see these people that have raised up and they're worshipping this false God saying that he's got victory over you but Lord if it takes if it takes and it kills me Lord let me destroy every bit of this and know that that the word can be proclaimed that you have overcome all of this and you know he come walking in there and they thought well you know what he can't do nothing well you know what they missed the fact that the Covenant was back and you know what he prayed to God and God give him the strength back God gave him his anointing back and all of a sudden he came in there and you know what he had a desire to destroy all the works of the enemy but you know what it took his death to overcome that and he walked right out there and he grabbed a hold of those pillars and you know what he gave a show but you know what he won't because he had a desire to overcome every ounce of that he wanted to overcome all that the devil had destroyed in his life and you know what he grabbed a hold of that thing and he came again to push and he began to push and he pushed and he pushed those pillars down and it all fell and he killed him and he killed all of them so that the scripture says that more were killed at his death and in his life he destroyed more he destroyed the works to the enemy but you know what his brothers and sisters we have a great enemy that kind of that is before us and you know it's trying to take over us what and you know the thing is is all the works of the enemy because but you know what greater is he that sent us and he that's in the world you don't want it's Satan realizes he's only got a little time to work and you know he's going he's going to oppress why because this is the hour that the pressure would be applied to the bride but you know what the thing is is as the pressure is being applied to you you just be just like Samson and you get ahold of that you push back and you push back wherever is where the devil's attacking you then you push why because God's giving you anointing to push to break the powers of the enemy but you know what you stand behind the word and he'll give you the place and he'll tell you what to do why because he said the word of truth lead you and guide you and he would give you the overcoming but you've got to stand there and say Lord give it to me Lord led me leave me to the place that I can be an overcomer just like you'd have me to be in order that's not my ideas it's not my thoughts it's not my feelings old buddy short word give me your word lord give me revelation of the word many people have failed on that they don't realize well you know how to press sin they don't even know understand it you know people have gotten away from even even preaching the new birth and expressing anything that you know is just you know just haphazard and walking along blindly but God stir something up inside of us that we can come to the place there I understand where we need to be and what we need to do you know what because I know I don't want to have that then we'll have one foot hole I don't want him to have a a toenail on in anything I want I want it because God raised me up God annoying me God stir me up to the place that I don't want to have one inkling I don't want to have one place I don't want having anything of the devil I don't want to have any power of the enemy holding me back why because he's given me the freedom he's giving me the word to make me free and make me free indeed that's what I want to be I want to be free I want to be exactly what he's called me to be and you know what you say well brother brother and I failed we don't want God's giving us a word he's giving us a place that you can overcome one because he doesn't matter because he's amazed oh no God of grace he's a God of forgiveness and you know what the blood still flows and let me tell you something brother sisters if there's still a stirring inside of you then there's a god that's the responding to that can respond to that people people want to get all right you wonder if they've gone too far you know what sometimes you'll realize you ain't going far enough you've got a gun you've not gone too far to keep God away from you God standing there and God speaking to you that you can reach out and accept God and you can take his forgiveness and you take the blood and you can cover it and allow him to remove all that and put it in the sea of forgetfulness that he can touch you and give you exactly what you have need of to overcome but the question is are you going to press are you going to stand there say Lord bring me to the place that I can press that I can overcome the enemy that all the powers are the enemies that have been stand in front of me that have held me back we're all probably in front of me are you waiting for a great victory are you waiting for somebody else to have it I'm not waiting on brother Dale to give me my great victory I'm not waiting on somebody else to give me my great victory why because God's called me to come to this great victory God's calling me to the word to give me the overcoming power then it's me it's me that has to overcome I've got to overcome myself I gotta overcome my feelings and my doubts and everything well because I just got a limit the word says if I look like a failure if it looks like I've lost everything within you know what I'm still going to hold on and if God sends me to hell you know what I'm gonna still hold on to the word I'm gonna stay right there are we gonna no we're just going to start to fall away just like everybody else so many people have walked in this message for all these years stood up and proclaimed all this and all of a sudden they're off to the side they're blinded grinding on the Philistines wheel but you know what we've been given a great victory and you know what it takes it takes you dying out Lord let us die out to ourselves to our thinking Lord as Sampson was let's just destroy everything Oh Lord give us that power that we can overcome you know because there's a time God's called a group of people in this hour did you know what they're going to overcome every power of the enemy even death there will be a group that won't even have to see death why because every power the enemy's already defeated they're going to come to that place where he's defeated you know what and you have you have that ability God's giving it to a man god bless you tonight let's stay on how the musicians come you know where we are an overcomer and i don't know what i don't know what key it's gonna be in but i want to sing that song we've been made more than conquerors over comers in this life we are made victorious through the blood of jesus christ because God has made us victorious God has called us to that place and don't let the things that happen in your past hold you back you know because the things that we've had in the past it's time to put them in the past whatever has happened you know we need to come to a place that we we get a revelation that the things that we've we've confessed and we've put under the blood they're still there they're still covered and you know what God don't hold them don't don't remember those things God don't hold them against us anymore you know we're free and clear of all of that then you know what we shouldn't be worrying about them we shouldn't be thinking about them we shouldn't be dueling on why because God's not dwelling on them God's not thinking about them Gus I'll hold them over your head but you know what we do you know what if you fail you know what everybody else does too you know what we're all human we've all had Fell's and faults and failures you know what we're always gonna have faults and failures I mean we're always gonna have problems y'all won't have to but you know what it's you going to keep continue overcoming them right you know why he's giving us the ability to overcome them you know if you if if you have if you have a problem and you keep having to deal with the same thing and you keep going to the same thing then you know that's the time that you need to sit down and get fortified behind the word and get to the place that you overcome that because you know sometimes people get to the place well you know I I've dealt with this for so long I guess I'll always have that right well if you if you want that you always have it or you can come the place where you overcome it well we'll try we've been made more than car overcomers in this love we've been mainly Turia's through the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] even mail [Music] comer's and this slaw we've been made Victoria their blood of Jesus Christ [Music] we've conquered comers in this we've been made
