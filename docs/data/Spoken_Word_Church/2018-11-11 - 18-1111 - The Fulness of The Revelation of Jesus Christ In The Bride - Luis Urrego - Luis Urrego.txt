========================================

Chris so it makes some double nerves yeah just pray for him huh that's that's why yeah I'm trying to get in the habit of sitting up front at least every other service especially when these other ministers when the other ministers come in a minister because uh you know it really helps to have other ministers up from work it really does for support it's just my brother Dale might be different because I mean he's a veteran either the you know he to me he's good preaching with the one person that is 250 people you know it doesn't matter that let's bow our heads our gracious Lord Jesus would thank you Father once again for your blessings thank you for waking us up this morning with good health and strength we appreciate your mercy your grace and love to us father would ask you now father that you bless this time that we have together here speak a little bit about your work help us to receive something Lord that in my strength enough father God for this journey and also father may you help mother Bob strengthen him Lord give him comfort given peace Lord and just help them Lord Jesus to go and just speak father God what you put in his mouth Lord God Almighty and or do you know exactly what the people need so bodyguard you know through him those things that we need bless him now praying bless brother dev by the way the doctor out Lord adjust watch over them say father we pray in Jesus Christ yes whether they leave Saturday Oh wherever that gone okay all right well this morning uh kind of maybe is this is sort of like a little introduction of what I'm really wanting to speak about Lord willing Wednesday and but I got to tell you everything that brother Dale and brother Wade has been bringing out lately has been so so good to me I don't know about you but for me it's been expended I open it it's you know just the Lord just wanting to reveal and wanted to really understand who we are you know as a people we're not just here just to be here or just to come to church or just to you know fill in a Pew we're here to manifest Jesus Christ in this out right and you can't manifest Jesus Christ without the word being involved right you have to have the word being involved in so I've really really really appreciate it because every time anything that has to do with that cap that capstone the headstone cornerstone I love those topics I love those topics and and so it's really impressed me and so I was telling my wife you know I go back and I listen or I just I reflect or look at notes that I messaging they're not preached in the last year the last two years in the last three years even here and and I see how God is helping helping us grow you know and then I go back and and sometimes you just go back and you kind of you look at something like wow I thought that was great at the time but now when you look at it again and you realize what God has given you right now and you look at those notes and those things like that it's like it just opens up even more you know and so I got over there and probably probably attest to that and so so but I want to look at this here if we're reading Colossians chapter 1 and we want to talk about you know the secrets of God and the secret of God and also a little bit maybe about the importance of Revelation but I don't want to get too much too much of ahead of myself because I want to leave a lot a lot of up for Wednesdays Colossians chapter 1 it says verse 21 says in you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now have he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and Unruh provable in his sight I want you to that's how God sees you unblameable Unruh provable holy in his sight yeah we have such a hard time seeing ourselves that way because we make mistakes we fall we do we think we failed him every single day and we have to repent everything right but yet Paul is saying that this is how God sees us so we need to start exercising because if you don't see yourself this way you're not going to be exercised you're not going to exercise the word that you have to manifest in this hour with confidence yes right you have to recognize yourself this way we have to recognize ourselves this way hmm if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard in which was preached to every creature which is under heaven well I Paul and made a minister now that tells me right there that there you can be moved away I mean there's a pup house putting that possibility yes we've seen it in this our people who we thought who who probably loved probably said I love this message there's nothing better than this message 40 years into it and now they're moved away now they don't even they preached it let's just stay with the word and they don't know where to take the people there you know so kind of leaving people hanging so you have to work your own salvation with fear and trembling the Bible says every single day don't get confident don't get stale do not do pay attention to what God is trying to do in this out all you may have heard you may have heard the message and headstone now probably hundreds of times brother they'll may be speaking about it something it you still because we're still here the resurrection hasn't still taken place there's still something that we're not getting right it has to become a revelation it has to be something personal to you amen and the revelation of Jesus Christ is vast it's in layers and we'll discuss more about that maybe just a little bit but maybe Wednesday will bring something out amen maybe you might might help you understand it a little better or proper something well visuals to me helps me and so especially when we're turning we're preaching to a mixed congregation young people everybody I want everybody to try to get what I'm trying to say you see and and so I think I like visuals praise the Lord so if you continue in the faith grounded and settle and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven where a by pollen made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body sick which is the church where I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his Saints amen this is now made manifest today remember in Revelation chapter 1 it says the the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him right now we part of that body of Christ or are we not part of that body of Christ we're we're we're own of his bone flesh of his flesh flesh life of his life when he was here on earth we were in him amen not you know not physically but we were part of that eternal life that he had remember remember he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily be welded involved in but yeah yeah even brother Prem says this Jesus Christ did not even know all things he did not know all things because remember even at Mount Transfiguration when he went to the Mount Transfiguration Elijah and Moses there wrecked one references representing the the the word the 10 commandments amen the law and then largely represented the prophets right they were discussing what were they discussed about the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that's what brother Branham said because Jesus Christ wasn't made manifest to hear me and then even though he had the fullness of the Godhead bodily Bullock he had all of God dwelling in him he was God right yet he still didn't know and so in revelation 1 it says that the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him now I believe it came to him in layers as well humanly speaking his human part right because remember the life that he lived we also have to live as a Christian if where he was the son of man here right we have to manifest the Son of Man as well and we get it by layers just as he got it by layers as well right so now I wasn't the brother branham was the one who said that he didn't know all things and we they will read something about that amen in that side he grows in Christ they grow in grace and knowledge that's exactly right sure did does he know sometimes we think that he he everything built in him and that he knew everything yeah he knew what God wanted him to know that's right all right same thing with brother like our prophet of this day know all things only what God wanted him to know that we needed to know right thing that we needed all right two persons that the moon god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory when we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus you this is Christ has been a mystery to the further throughout all the ages for the people amen but in this last day amen there has to be that son of man ministry to unfold amongst the bride in this hour right remember of the braids been taco by the weights been talking about that son of man Minister that little work that's coming in at the end time it is that's gonna take place amen and that's the Bride of Christ in this hour because remember that resurrection has to take place we're not gonna leave here without that resurrection amen I'm looking for a resurrection amen praise the Lord now in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 4 says whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which another ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit amen that the Gentile should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel so here's Paul is reiterating the fact that your heirs and joiners with you whatever he got is what you will get the Bride of Christ will get because why he's the head and we are the body that follows sister Lisa's head as part of sister Lisa's body and when her head moves her body doesn't do something totally different I mean I guess it could but I mean you know her body wants to follow in the direction of the head right and that's exactly what what what Christ did here on earth amen is what his bride is gonna do is going to manifest in this house that son of man ministry amen that was gonna produce a resurrection praise the Lord we're just we're just we're just we're God in human flesh in this our God is not going to use any other flesh it's gonna be a work through you and I now why did he choose it that way I don't know but that's how it is and you have to recognize that you have to see it that way that God is doing all this work through me God chose me to do a work like this yes God chose you to do a work like this and this hour praise God first Corinthians chapter 2 verse 7 it says but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory you see God already ordained desportes that mystery to be for to be a opened up for us already now if he'd done that why are we not manifest in that already know Jesus Christ after he after he died resurrected you know and before he ascended he said all power is given unto me both if all power was given unto him then why are we why doesn't he just go ahead and just have manifested sons of God already you and I just have everything already in us as far as you know be in his very image being his in his fullness no we have to grow in grace and knowledge and revelation just as he did amen because it's all there he's already it's all power is given unto him and if we're part of him all power is given unto us right oh both in heaven and in earth right but why aren't we manifesting that why because we still have revelation Amen that we need to we need to we need to a men God reveals some things to us to us that we manifest amen we here we here we here we listen with listen but I don't think a lot of us are a cop captain yet what's been what's being said including me because we're still here amen that's right perfect stature appropriate man we're all growing right man but you see a child you don't see it grow I'm sorry sister you know a child you don't see it grow I mean you know if you're with it all the time you do not see that child grow yesterday one day whoa as tall as I am but that is a way of Christian man yeah you don't grow overnight that's exactly that it makes little by little it takes layers upon layers upon layers upon layers amen praise God all right so we're all right yes which verse a which none of the princess of this world need for a pad they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory you think the Jews would have crucified the Lord if if he was the one to fulfill this whole plan for this world you know the way to meet of unfolding wouldn't have done that if they knew that that was their Messiah they would not have done that but they did not know it was not revealed to them right for they had known it they were not used by the Lord but as it is written I had not seen nor hear had heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared past tense one thing is in God's mind it's already been done and they men have prepared for them that love all right but God hath revealed past tense hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit right for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of God amen as I said before I believe a shot of the life of a Christian spirit-filled Christian is not satisfied with just Jesus died for me on or I gotta be good Christian I got a lift right I gotta take my tots no the Spirit of God searches all things even the deep things that's what the scripture says right even the deep things of God all right I'm not satisfied with just just a little bit of the word I want more and more and more I want each layer that God wants to give me for what men know if the things of a man save the spirit of Man which is in a men even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God you don't know it all you knew is is how to do what you do you know you know I was a good sinner when I was a sinner right so were you but when Christ came on the scene and he filled us with the Holy Ghost amen then we know all things because the Spirit dwelleth in us right because it's the Spirit of God amen revealing those things to us praise God we have the potential of all these for all these things now Psalms 25:18 just raising the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him and he will show them his covenant now maybe I'll show them my covenant no he will show them his covenant even though it's a secret he's going to show it to you for in the time Psalms 27 buffer in the time of trouble shall hide me mister linen the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing yea I will sing unto the Lord in Matthew 13 11 says he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given Jesus speaking to his disciples when disciples asked him why do you talk to them in parables and because of to them was given the seat the know the mysteries of the kingdom now he was thrown mysteries to them some Jesus Christ was explaining mysteries to them and in explaining things to the myth of parables that that he was talking about but that didn't say Peter Paul then he saved them right they still need to go and have a new birth that word was being was was being given to them but that word needed to come alive on the day of Pentecost right right right because even before the day of Pentecost just to lose just a little bit before that Peter Peter and did not Christ and he said I'm going back fishing after healing the sick raising you know doing all these miracles and all these things and yet I think I'm just gonna go and become an entrepreneur again you know great wonderful things taking place and mysteries being given to them and yet he still wanted to go back fishing and I believe sometimes amen we can be just like that we're not careful great mysteries unfolded to us service by service church service by church service and we're just there so what kind of lunch I'm gonna have tomorrow for sure for without working it do I have turkey in my refrigerator and the word and mysteries being unfolded unto us and we're thinking about physical things let's drinks being unfolded them to us but why it takes the revelation of Jesus Christ God given us just like God give it to him in Revelation chapter all the way it says in Revelation chapter 1 I believe the fullness of that revelation was given to Jesus Christ once he resurrected a man from the dead because he said all power is given unto me both heaven and earth amen praise the Lord now I took this before this is the tabernacle I love the tabernacle of Moses it so it just typifies Christ in every aspect but you see these skins now exposed 26:14 and thou shalt make a covering for the tent of Rams skins dyed red and the covering above badger skins do you see that there was when this tabernacle was going through the wilderness this is this is what the people externally would see the the tabernacle covered with these with these skins with these bags this badger skin now you tell me if that's pretty that's ugly that's the I give to me if it was me making it I want the world to see the beautiful how beautiful something is I would want the nicer one to be on the outside I mean I think that's how we use most of us are we want the nicer ones of the outside because what you want people to say man that looks sharp that was good but God told this is how God told Moses to build this tabernacle and he put the ugliest one the Badger about your skin on the outside why because the people had no clue that the most beautiful thing was taking place inside of that tabernacle all right and you and me amen we're living in these badger skins right I'm not I mean I'm not the prettiest thing to look at definitely Timbo is not right but God is dwelling in he I'm doing a work manifest in his life in his life among all those layers right now these layers can represent our physical body right we have layers and upon layers on us right mainly there's the three amen the soul the spirit and the body right but also this is how the revelation of Christ unfolds to us right because if somebody would have found that this tabernacle or were to maybe walk in it right and they would have seen it covered like this and everything like that maybe they came from behind or something I don't know exactly this is just a depiction of how man kind of thought thinks that that's how it is but maybe that they would have to go through all these layers to get into the entrance right the same thing with you and I growing in this revelation and this knowledge it's layer upon layer upon layer upon layer of Revelation it's revelation on top of Revelation on top of Revelation and puff of Revelation right and you might think you might be under the badger skin off I got under that God your skin and then oh this is so nice that next skin this is so pretty look how red and it is and you think that's wonderful that revelation is wonderful until God shows you the next revelation on top of that oh this is wonderful this is so beautiful look at this look how it's and then God all of a sudden lifts up the next one and see oh my this is even more wonderful you see Saints that's how that's how we need to be taking every church service that we come to amen it's a revelation on top of Revelation on top of Revelation amen God is unfolding himself because remember just you take your children for example you could not give them everything all at once all the knowledge that they needed to have you they cannot give it to them all at once right they have to take little layers and upon little they're like when you saw that they were mature enough for that layer that you just gave them you could give him a little bit of more on top of that right same thing with Christ with us God with us he's not going to give us everything all at once to overwhelm us it's more beautiful I think when he does it in us in a slower way because why he's teaching us patience and he's seen that effort that you're trying to make for this work God give me more give me more why because there still has not been a resurrection to take place and therefore we have not gotten everything or we have not tapped with the word is there it's been open Jesus Christ said all power is given unto me the seals have been broken here but as brother Wade is said before why are we still here 50 years after the seals have been opened right why was still in 50 years because we have not caught that fullness of the revelation in us and then when they go in there when they get in there amen and beyond Slayer I almost almost kind of type look at this is my life when I was in the mountain de nominal in the nomination you know we were out here first when I was born I was here Catholic and then Joe was when we came to the States Jehovah's Witnesses came and visited us and we thought wow that sounds good so my mom and dad said wow let's go to church over there because we weren't really practicing Catholics we were just kind of like those passive type of Catholics you know we go you know if we wanted to we didn't you know and then wow the HOS witness came knocking at the door and then it wasn't job as witness we got tired of that we went there for a year then we went to doing Baptists for me men and then we went to the Methodists for a while and then from the Methodists we went back to the Baptist and then from the Baptist's we hit Pentecost get a little closer India thank you it was a little closer as much bad girl we're opening up to us you know cuz the Pentecostals they have they had some good things you know that bid and then finally you know God showed us his word amen this message amen but you see I thought at that time when the message came to because it was me that not to say that like it was me but it was i we all heard it my mom my dad my sisters we all heard it all at the same time but it was really me that that wanted to look more into it my dad was still kind of passive with it and everything because he didn't understand what was going on and so I started studying this Baptist in the name of Lord Jesus Christ even more MORE Wow and I said that you've got to see these scriptures you've got to see these things and when he saw the scriptures when he saw the word remember he was Baptist and Mike's brother Dale says you know about this know the word my dad was very he knows the word but he but Bumi so when you see show him the word and they said wow there's nobody back doesn't name father son Holy Ghost that's it give me more Lord so and so we had just appreciate the Lord so but in there and that's why the Bible says that there was no beauty in Christ that we should that we should Christ when he was here on earth he wasn't he was like a common regular man just like you and I appeared at that time you know long garments you know just look just like any other man but within him dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead bodily and you and I on this are you you and I are just common people you know but within us amen it was God in our soul amen now we're going to have it in down payment of it maybe just a portion of it but it's all God even that portion and if we can do these greater works even with that little portion imagine that he meant meant the fullness amen takes place amen then those Resurrectionist has to take place amen then and then after that is a rapture praise God and this is Scripture a man who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed revelation for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground have you guys ever have you seen a root now you see the Bible says this says he shall grow built before him as a tender plant who is he talking about what's this here to talk about talking about Christ right and as a root out of a dry ground right but in the corded button we're talking in this case I'm talking about Christ amen in in this in this month a moment but you see Christ a room is something ugly when you're when you're out in the garden and you're looking at your beautiful garden of flowers and everything you plant even other things that you plant you don't say what beautiful group that is that's such a pretty root no you look at the at the at the fruit at the end what's come out of the root right and so and as a root out of a dry ground all right he had no form nor comeliness right in other words he's not something beautiful to look after and when we shall seek him there is no beauty that we should desire him didn't the scripture saying we didn't we didn't waiting when we would look when people would look at Jesus Christ back then they would it wasn't something oh man I want to get in here but the only way people wanted more of him is because of the works that he would manifest same thing with you or not God and God looks at people look at us like a regular common people Amen but if you're talking a good if you say you're a Christian and you manifest that on the outside because remember people want to see works they don't want to see you just talking want to hear you talking remember that there's that same don't preach me a sermon let me a sermon okay that's exactly what people out in the world want because they are all of them out there they don't live sermons they talk serve that you know sermons they can you know but they want some ones they see somebody living a sermon that's something I opens out I want some more of that you give me more of that that's the same thing with Christ he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted and we did as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not reminds me of Peter when Christ was being was saying the priests and the Roman soldiers and everything and at one point Peter he said Lord I'll follow you wherever you go there I can't yeah no way I will deny him and it came the time to see if he was gonna pass that test and he did not need to not him and he didn't even want anything to do with Krait no I don't know that man I don't know that I meant in person and everything so now brother Brown says here throwing ties oh we got about five more minutes hmm now the Bible says here but many that are first shall be last in the last shell divorce mark chapter 10 verse 31 amen brother brems says here in the seal of God 1954 now watch him said hold it until what the eleventh hour people could come in the last calling of the Gentiles mother worked there dad and then work here grandmother work back there this is our age the eleventh hour that world war stopped on the eleventh month in the year the eleventh day of the month the eleventh hour that day in the day the eleventh minute in the hour that the eleventh hour people might come in a man pain what received the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that they did back there in the beginning we receive the same baptism it hasn't changed right I couldn't begin to bring back the power and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ same signs and wonders the same power in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and because Jesus Christ is the first fruit to the resurrection he had to race first and then the body follows just right behind as I said before when you are when you are laying in your bed when you get up in the morning some of us kind of maybe fall out but me personally what comes up first is the head I raise my head up from my pillow first right and then the body follows right that's exactly what happened in the life of Jesus Christ in the church that followed behind me he raised first the head amen then the body follows after it's got to read Ram says it has to there's no way that your head just gets up from the bed and the body doesn't follow you this way that's freak you're a freak then that's creepy they meant it has to the bodies if you're attached to that to that vine if you are attached to that vine praise God now as I've said before and of course I don't say this as a doctrine or nothing like that but I just can't help to look at this picture and it just to me just looks like a body that's laying down it really it really does to me now I know that the darkness the dark parts it represents the dark but it's just the way that is just drawn it kind of reminds me of he can use this analogy but that movie Frankenstein you know when when the doctor doctor whatever the doctor was building the body you know and then eventually he has that brain you know I just need that brain man and then that minute once you guess that brain it comes to life all right once the head is your manifesting the son of man which is the head in this hour they meant that bodies come into life that resurrection is taking place this thing is coming out and praise God got one minute all right but Ren says here now the church / / professed to be a Christian Church we'll have to have that same spirit that was in Jesus Christ attitude for at the resurrection of the church Christ and his bride will come together and dovetail the writings and promises of God will be made fulfilled there so it cannot come together unless the same spirit was in Christ is in you and me and then if that same spirit is in there it'll do the same words and live the same kind of a separated life and through the works it got cut off that he did amen and I don't know if you've seen this picture of the Bride of Christ I turned this over like this because the picture the picture but if the bride is dressed in the Word of God this is this is right that's that's the dress that the bride has him me in the head and to me I put put it over the church edges because it's the Bride of Christ throughout the whole church ages amen at the end time that son of man ministry has to has to be manifest at once again right who is the head that thing's coming up praise the Lord Amen so I guess let's go ahead [Music] [Music] [Music] that's why they don't recognize it's just too simplistic yeah yeah I just hit this but I guess
