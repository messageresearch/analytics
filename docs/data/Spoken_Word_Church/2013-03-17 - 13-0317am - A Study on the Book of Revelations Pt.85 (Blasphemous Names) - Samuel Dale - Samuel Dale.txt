pray that you would just touch each one and as they listen may they hear the word of the lord have your way now and guide us in jesus name amen revelations 1 and then we'll go to revelation 18 okay we're going to move try to get off of this today on the form we're trying to bring and move on to a little more this afternoon of helping us all so the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to christ and he sinned and signified by his angel and to it servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for what for the time is at hand all right let's go over to revelations 18 we'll try to get to this part today it says and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen it's become the habitation of devils and the hold of ever foul spirit in a cage of ever unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine or the wrath of her fornication the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are wax reached through her abundance over delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven and once a voice from heaven saying come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her pledge for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities now what's these two verses here reward her even as she rewarded you now once reward her in other words give her the reward of what she done to you remember what we do under others is accounted a lot of times and we better be careful and and do things correctly right but watch reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she had filled fill her double remember the cup she had in her hand we saw back over wednesday how much she has glorified herself and lived delicately so much torment and sorrow give her first she said in her heart i said a queen and have no widower widow and shall see no sorrow she says that partly therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord who judgeth her you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now what i'm going to try to do is finish this morning that we've been talking about this mystery babylon uh these things you know and showing what it is and the mother of harlots and showing those things and trying to uh give an understanding to where that we can can move on and then we'll try this afternoon to pick up into more talking about the bride of jesus christ and our parts because we've been covering from revelations 4 1 the rapture comes the prophet says we go up and we're not seen until 19 then you'll pick up this evening some of the things and and all like that and that's what people can't understand they just go haywire when you make that quote even though the prophet owned uh feast of the trumpets he said this thus saith the lord you know that that takes place but see they can't figure it out because they get over into revelations 10 and and how is that and then revelations 18 4 come out of her my people but they don't see what i've tried to bring to you that there's a compound meaning and a compound revelation of scriptures all right it doesn't put us over in this time frame that we have been talking about right just because it is talking about us it doesn't put us in genesis in the garden to read about genesis in the garden and see that all organized religions etc and all of our downfall and things like that come from the garden see it doesn't put us back there all right well why do we want to get over here and say yeah but that can't be so people will try to juggle the books as we call it and say that revelations not in order you got to turn it this way and turn it that way and move this scripture over here now no you don't have to move anything the prophet said the ends and the butts is in the right place what we need is a revelation to see the word of god is perfect amen and we don't have to to do anything we don't have to try to prop it up or try to do anything we just see that you know revelations 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we begin to say all of this should be revealed okay that's revelation 3 14 right right that's where it takes place okay so we get the message then israel gets this message see if you didn't have that way of pharmacy in it you wouldn't have anything to take to them you would have to go back and pick up brother branham and send him over to israel if you didn't take it in the correct order but we know that that way then where it says here come out of her my people well that's compound that means do you and i right come out of her mind but the main element or the main point or the main time frame is to israel in the tribulation and i've kept saying it over and over because i want you to see it that you know and i hope you're beginning to be able now to read the bible the book of revelations with better understanding from your own self you know to just follow and read it and look at these things but seeing that these things see are past us but yet we see what's going to take place and then we come from that that's going to take place to israel in the three and a half year tribulation period that is ascended from revelation 4 1 to revelations 19 is only a three and a half year period of the jacob's trouble called the tribulation and all of these scriptures that we've read and all the time we spent trying to understand takes place in that time frame well i mean to me that's wonderful because that way i know that if i go up in 4-1 i miss the tribulation i miss all of these things and i won't get over to it as much but i want you to read the 18th chapter especially real carefully and just see and that's why i emphasize verse 6 and 7 to see what is going to happen to this mystery babylon and the harlot daughters now remember we are not against people all right amen that's right no we're not against people i mean that's our brothers and our sisters their mamas our daddies our kin folks or whatever we're not against those times right what we're against is the system that ties everybody to that one thing and holds it and doesn't let you go on with god that's the thing we're against not the people they're people just like me and you but thank god that god chose you and i yeah that's right it's what we should be doing right but that don't make us look down you remember when we were covered how the 144 000 would be servants to the bride that we didn't cover it as them being slaves and them being our cooks and the washing the dishes and the ironing and we're laying back fat at you know because remember that's going to be in heaven i mean in the millennium right and it won't be in our ways you know i want you to i keep trying to emphasize things so that you'll remember it and then that way you'll see that it has to have a compound meaning to it because look at verse four and i heard another voice from heaven right saying come out of her my people right well right now if the voice is from heaven all right see then you've got to have a way for it to be done on earth so then you can easily see that the message of the hours must call us out amen right but then this message and carry it to israel all of that'll be on earth but that's why it says it didn't say that one half but one voice happened over here and the next voice happens over here it discovers the voice of god all right amen but then it'll say from heaven well put it where it's supposed to be amen then you can see that on earth remember we went through the the uh the three angels that went across in the everlasting gospel we see the everlasting gospel with justification preached by martin luther wasn't but go back and read that those angels sound from heaven then they transpire on earth amen the point i've been trying to get you and i to see and remember now the bible we believe it it's ordained of god don't we see then this is god's way of describing these signs it's not my ideas or your ideas of describing the mystery babylonian on we know who that is the romans and the catholic church coming down in the harlot daughters we know that's organized religion and you know how i bring it right on down to lula heights and branhamites i don't stop i bring it right on down to your ideas and my ideas that are contrary to the word of god right all right see because that's organized religion you be an organization be one person right now i mean you don't have to have nobody to join we to be an organization see when you organize something against the word of god did eve need any help bringing us all down right now she organized it amen and that brought this this is what god is saying about this so it's not you and i saying this why because we know they're people we know the human right but god is looking at it from the other side he's looking at it like we look at saying uh wait a little longer you know your jesus still we get our families in well he knows whether they're coming in or not so the prophet said good song there ain't no scripture to it harley all right a new name written in heaven his mind is mighty said good song but said no scripture see because god knows what it's going to be but now we can believe for our families and you know god knows whether or not you're going to play far right did not the prophet say it like this he said if you can't believe for your family i doubt you believing for yourself he said well i just can't see my kids i just can't see them coming in i can't see my family well what are you doing in front of them that's right come on bro do they want what you have that's right man come on do they want what you have and what you lived before right right that might be one of your kids is not here right no does that hurt feelings well brother dale you just see this one of the lucky ones well thank god for being lucky that's right right but you see what i'm getting at that's why i've told you many times maybe some of you need to go to your kids and apologize to them for the way you've lived before them to try to try to describe jesus christ i don't like you talking like that to me well great go do something about it and i won't be talking about you right that's right but you understand what i'm saying see what i want us to do today to finish this stuff about looking at this and and mainly finishing in the 18th chapter not every verse but just finish up a point that this is what's going to happen to the people who reject this word and not just reject this message that's great but see if you turn down jesus christ in whatever form he's preached right wouldn't it even paul that said it or one of them there that said if even if christ is preached by contention you know in other words a couple of guys out there arguing he said i praise god for it because might give somebody an opportunity here that they'll never hear right that don't justify arguing no i'll just say it if it happens that way god will get to glory amen see then we have it in the correct order of what to do but now think about it we found out in chapter 17 that this mystery babbling according to verse 16 and 17 in there that it was so beautiful until john admired it remember wednesday john admired this right you look out there today as i said wednesday night you look out there today and you see beautiful great big cathedrals great big churches and things and they're doing marvelous work they're feeding a lot of the poor they're they're they're you know sending money to before build orphanages and et cetera all around the world and john with the baptism of the holy ghost now for over 40 years and yet when he sees it as it's laid out before him he doesn't see the the uh uh bad things of the preachers and the priests and the people with their adulterous acts and and stuff like that he doesn't see it that way he sees it as a beautiful situation and he admired it well it ain't deceived me well just remember you was deceived until you heard this message go forget it you know don't be so big no books just you know we're going to be something let's just be what we are i cured a baptist bible and try to convert it to a baptist faith what church was you in i believe we had it but i'd argue with them about what they said we had i'm getting trouble then just like i do now i used to tell them in the dickens meeting i said come find out the bible says we're supposed to wait on tables and you're telling me we're supposed to set the preacher down if he goes off the word because that's what they told him i said where's it in the bible all i know is wait on tables but listen church isn't it time to be playing but the prophet said when they said we talked enough about that you know talk about the antichrist and the thing all right i want to end this this morning we could spend weeks and months and years taking each of these verses and stay on these things but i wanted to get over into the bride we're seven his wife has made herself ready we'll try to get over this afternoon because that's what i want to go on with but i realized one thing now i want you to listen and we'll come back to it this evening the double compound meaning of us seeing these things right not being physically over here because this is way on down the road but seeing where this is leading up to this what do you think it means that she's made herself ready right amen there's two ways and we'll try to cover this evening i just want to hit it let you think she's made herself ready we read to the armored meat packing boy you know going out to get him a wife and a little worse girl and you hear people they preach it and they preach it totally that she's out there slaving taking her pennies to buy her dresses and things but what about what brethren said she took the money he sent her you don't hear that see that's where i've got to keep it balanced you can go off either way and say he supplied everything more you can back that up with scripture or you can go over and say now he he actually she's having to do all this work what won't you do like run around with him let her spend her penis but let her let him send her some money that's what he says well i never heard him when we get to it this evening but listen church what do you think i'm trying to build up to you realize this that we've been in the grinding from chapter 4 up to now in the 18th chapter is pointing to the place that all of this is what brings about the making herself ready and the last part we come through here is what come out of her my people should we take that this evening see then we'll try to lift up but see you think this has been a dumb a humdrum time of not learning all of this is a system that started somewhere that's what i've been trying to get to all of these is a system of people a group of doings and all a religious matter if you and i don't overcome don't worry about the 19th chapter it ain't going to be there you ain't going to be riding back victorious with him all right man do you if we don't get this right if we don't see what the system is and love the people why can't you right more than people expect i wouldn't guard in the door with a non-national church i might get a bad spirit yeah you might rub off some on them oh i need a face in the mirror on that one you might take some bad ones down to them all right i can see that but you see church and all of this that i'm aiming is aiming to come down to i tell you i try to wrote around one day i heard him sit like this and i thought what's he doing he said i got a scripture in mind and he just preached and preached and preached and preached to priests you know we you never he never did reading said that's the scripture i had in mind you know like that right well that's what i thought he would do after a while he'd give me the drive that scripture i could read but then while he'd say i i've got a scripture in mind or i got another scripture in mind but see he was going through the word of god verse by verse i come to realize that if he'd have something in mind well how many services ago did we start in revelations 4-1-5 especially chapter 6 you know 20 sermons ago or something 40 hours of messages pointing to this afternoon to preach come out of here my people and show how to be the bride has made herself ready because if we haven't made ourselves ready it's not coming out of him or her neither one we're tied up with our organized religion and see the prophet warned us about being sympathetic he said you can be sympathetic and he said you become spirits right i'll try to tell you it don't bother me um buddy of zacks you know about a year or so ago he he preached his first sermon in the baptist church where we came from there there in gilbertson georgia so we had plenty of time in the afternoon when we left here you know where we went that night the whole family oh that was a shock look out there here comes the whole dale family all of us now just walking in you know sit down listen the boy preach just remember you're not going to get a spirit right is that clear you say brother brown didn't like cats he didn't say he's obscured him he just said he didn't like him you know what i don't like cats in that way either because they're sneaky right they'll lay in one place for an hour waiting on a mouse to move for a bird they're sneaking you know what i see i pick that spirit up from people especially preachers that are sneaky yeah they're just sneaking around you know no wonder they don't like cats it's their spirit i wish you'd figure mine out because i don't even know what it is well there was a dog or a cat or a horse or a donkey or whatever it would be i don't haven't figured out what i am yet even myself no but listen church he's just trying to get you to see something it does no good to talk about the bride has made herself ready you know the wife right until we see all about it and see how that's done that's what i've been preaching for 20 sermons through here to be able to preach one sermon so you don't know how to overcome what until you learn what you need to overcome right that's all i mean but you see what i'm talking about john admired this when he saw this end time church system of all of its beauty and its works and its things that it was that it's doing now that are wonderful feeding the hungry doing those things hospitals owned by churches that if you can't afford they will let you go there you know and things like that people giving their whole lives dedicating their lives to the church in the work of the church and then you say well brother adam shouldn't be so hard he's not hard he's looking at it straight you want how many quotes do you want were they it was the catholic no i believe them right now when they started to build onto the tabernacle to fix it the catholics what was what that they said you can't i'm paraphrasing and said you can't do that because you ain't got enough parking space said that catholic priest or whatever he was one of them told him said you let this baptist or whatever it is over here bill said now what's wrong with them bill if i get the names wrong you put it in the right place because it happened that's right i'll be glad to find it for you he said these cross backs i'll tell you one is that's hard to understand it took a long time for me to realize what he's saying about 1962 somewhere in there i'll find it for you he said the baptist has just now become a denomination over 100 years old probably right right now that's what he's saying you realize that he would say then that the denominations was a carrier sure oh that's right that's what he said nothing garbage can didn't create me bless god well you ain't got anywhere yet anyway somebody had to carry you that's right you see that's why brother branham was welcomed but the doctrine he preached the message he preached was not welcome right that's what i'm trying to get us to see these things here you take these things you can preach for years on these things to lay it down in our lives to see that we're not blessed i won't even dare turn my head and look that way how are you going to win but i'm not going down fellowship in them churches will kind of remember your prophet preaching number one about an opportunity today to go to this brother here's an invite but he's never said any more about it they never said any more battleground and preached for it there's no problem and i wouldn't go over and scream and holler and connect the whole church and knock them all down and go to hell we was listening the other day the prophet said where he said in the old days he said in his discernment he would just call out things you ever heard him say this and he said one day i called out a preacher that was a large congregation he said because i openly called him out said he lost over half his church he said i hated that he said i won't do it again you see but what are we right oh yeah we don't want to get tired of organized religion come find out we got it that's the purpose of me trying to read all of these things and to give us you and i to look at it right let's drop back now up into wednesday night because i i didn't finish the message most of you would know if he even got the notes she surely knew it let's drop back and just cover what he was talking about in chapter 17 then we'll take a little bit in chapter 18. try to finish it up i may read just a few of these quotes to get to talk but it called her mystery babbling but in verse 3 it says and so he carried me away into the spirit and took in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman set up on a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns names of blasphemies he said i looked that up in the original diagonal and it said it doesn't say names of blaspheming said it says blasphemous names he said now there's a lot of difference between black famous names and names of blessings yes well that's just too early to swap them where they land no see names of blaspheming can actually be vulgar words you use you know people blaspheme god by their words huh because that's what you're doing that's just names of blessings that just means there's something there that you use to speak wrongly but when you say blasphemous names that means not just saying the wrong word or the wrong act it means that's blasphemous there's names that are blaspheming god by being those names do you understand him yes i that's why you don't see in this message where it would say is written over a building well because we're not we're set to work with paul harvey that said that the believers of this message wasn't an organization because they didn't follow the leader with a cult because they didn't follow the leader and do what he said that's a pretty good statement about him right you know how dirty that makes us right you know that we could make this a blasphemous name you see what i'm talking about names of black demons is going one way now you just any kind of uh an idea or thought you have but when you say blasphemous names you're narrowing that down to your name now watch as we read it and you're saying that your name is god's name come on come on church open up and think a little bit don't cut me off just think of what i'm saying why does all of the baptists want everybody to be baptist once all the methodists want everybody to be made right why did all the brandomites want everybody to be brown yeah but you shouldn't talk like that about us this is the place you are to be talking you know i don't mean that wrong i just mean there's none of them out there to be that sorry you see church blasphemous names you're saying that you have the way to heaven or else why do you have that name right right right around him i'll give it to you in a while he said the catholic church was the first organization he said and lutherans was the second now like i said while ago you realize that the denominations didn't really get sealed away off from god until this message came right that's right right when they rejected this message they cut off every hope they had that's right amen right as a church as a system of church that's why the prophet said the baptist just become a denomination right what they had finally denominated against god yes no no no well i thought we played the message with god yes amen that's what brother randall said you always make sure you put a comma we believe this this this comma he said anything else that god reveals he said when you put that period on earth you stop it and you won't accept nothing else but you mean there's 969 different denominational systems and that's a very small number 40 years ago in each one claiming to have the way to heaven now brother dale you don't understand that man if people like say it out there they don't have a sign out front we're the only way i know i know they haven't never read them but like was riding down the road one day they said everybody welcome i believe it was amnesty she said daddy does that mean us i said you gotta walk in we wouldn't be welcome to stay he said will you just stand he can't be mouthed yet well that's a good point too because he said go back to your organized religion you want those quotes around told the people to go but then keep on reading to where he said you let your light shine they'll throw you out well i got all of you out of the churches now like me they didn't throw me out and a lot of you will say they didn't throw me out they wanted me to study that's right but they didn't want what you got they wanted you to stay and keep your mouth shut right they didn't throw me out but you see the day i got baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i would have to know her see all of your denominations don't believe me that way but the baptist says if you get baptized any other way than what we are you're going to be baptized in this church i knew the day i baptized that out of the church no problem i had to leave i wouldn't cause no trouble and i didn't but listen church he says blasphemous names now basically all of these you'll read them out of black finger's name so i'd ask you to bring the book like paragraph 248 we won't go into these because i'm not too short i'm just reviewing that from wednesday paragraph 248 blasphemies he said calling themselves christians do you know of any church anywhere that doesn't proclaim to be christian but now if it's blasphemous names see then when i attack a name on desire no then by putting that name on it i'm saying that's the way to heaven you don't believe that that's right go ask a little bit go find you somebody so you believe you all are the only way to heaven no but we believe this is the closest way right come on let's go talk a little bit and find out that's right claiming to be christians goes on to ordination in 1962 he said setting themselves as christians sending themselves right one of my guests organized religion 62. he said bringing together churches then he goes down to paragraph 190 of that same message and he says they're lodges if we believe brother branham was the prophet then he is transmitting to us the things god says about this church amen you believe in jeremiah and i keep emphasizing he didn't beat the deaf people right it was a system for the church right all right but he calls them lodges he goes down the paragraph which we read if you'll keep on reading in your scripture it says the the cage or it does in verse uh two it's the the hold of ever foul spirit in cage of ever unclean and hateful birds brother adam is talking one time and he says eagles he said no no no he said it's the foul birds he said we are the little eaglets amen now i've always told you let's read i don't preach a lot don't go out and condemn organized religion or whatever out there and beat on its head but because i i'm beating on this this year right or anybody else will listen see the church the prophet said he was he called them churches one day and the holy spirit said they're not churches they're lodges that's right you know the old saying birds of a feather what locked together right baptist birds methodist birds presbyterian birds catholic birds randomized birds little birds you don't like me going down that way do you that's where we all start from we're not trying to convert the world i'm not pastoring the world on the internet i'm pastoring a little georgia trying to get it converted get us away from being the cage of every unclean bird the prophet said eagles he said no no no not eagles lodges the holy spirits are down churches they're like that's right the methodist lodge a bad dislodger but you see that's that old mother and the harlot daughters now if you need it i'll be glad i think i've got it in here i might not but brother random says that they admit this revelation 17 the mystery babylon said according to the facts of our faith you had the book and you read it he said they admit that's them the catholic church admits that's them now if you need that and i've either got them laying here they'll be in the office either way you want it you want internet if you need that quote call me or just look at your computer and you'll find it but now they admit they were the home of the now who's the harlot daughter the ones with the same doctrine right remember we've been through that over and over the same doctrine amen you see church if we don't see where we're at we can't get anywhere that's right we start from where we're at i've always said this and i wonder how many of you done it have you ever thanked god for bringing you out of an organized religion thank you for bringing it out from the truth amen sure we'd love to see everybody on our shave with her amen but sometimes we got to realize it won't work in a way that's right so you know what we do we get everybody we can cage of all unclean birds he called it in revelation 18. and then the emphasis i'm wanting you to get is that you can't see that you're a cage or in a cage why would it say come out on earth right right come on are you thinking why would it say come out of her if we're already out a blessed god i never was in none of that you're your own denomination that's what your trouble is now if you want to admit where you're at you can't be helped right that's right i said it when i come in this message it wasn't understood then and i don't know where to be understood now but i said god you got me out of that denomination now get that denomination out of me what do you mean you laughed it and brother motor had a good saying you got your coat and hat and changed meeting places i'm in the message bless god well it's a message in you there's a lot of difference in that that's right but you see church if we're going to believe verse 4 has to be calling us out then that means we got to be somewhere to be called out of all right yep and you can see then that all these angels and all these things that have talked to us you remember how we were bringing out that the first one was martin luther with the joshua lived by faith was the everlasting gospel the prophet said in the next was wesley and he said the next was pentecost but then you come on to the measure to the hour and you see this message is telling us to come out of him right was it not the third angel sweeping across that was to tell about the mark of the beast you remember that the mark of the beast which is not a stamp across our forehead or on our hands or somewhere it's in our understanding our intelligence they say if you go down to an insane institution they ask you if you're crazy and you say no no i'm not they said they're gonna hold over there put him in it the other one they say you crazy man i act like it a lot of times i guess i am i said put him over here and hope for that filler you know see because you're not admitting what you are right is that right with the alcoholics anonymous what's the first thing i want you to say i'm an alcoholic right right that's the first step to get started no i'm not an alcoholic i just drank two gallons a day but listen church do you see what i'm talking about i've got the quotes if you want them but then when you get down to about verse 8 of the 17th chapter i just want to emphasize this a little bit the beast that thou saw us was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit now we know who that is right we know that satan coming out of the bottomless pit right but what did he say the prophet of god says there's no foundation you see he said that's the pope i'm quoting from the second seal paragraph 303 paragraph 62 the indictment 1963 he says a succession of hopes that's what it means that he that was and he is not sure it was and he is not right was and is not was and is not right he said they believe in apostolic succession you know it's odd that that's in the land amen there's a group of church epic games up there we went up in a fellowship with them a little bit you know one time and that's what they were apostolic succession they believed it was passed down you would go in and you had a meeting and there was no preacher thought there was a pastor over the whole thing but they would all sit there and they'd wait on whoever the spirit came upon to speak that night you know and so he went on i tried to be nice i went up and said i don't they wanted me to come and went upside down and sat on the back and they said about three rows for the preachers you know i sat down on the back then the the preacher come up and he said uh brother dale we want you up on front row i said the bible says to take the last seat you know and then if you're invited he said i'm inviting you to come up the first row you know and he said how about getting up speaking tonight well that wasn't according to their succession because i was supposed to come in and tell them i got to make house you know anybody went in and told them they'd let me preach because that's apostolic succession trying to let you know facing things down but it kind of runs in this message just a little bit you know what group you in you know what pope are you following remember the folk was a false prophet right all right right around him on the feast of the trumpets paragraph 2 13 2 14. 1964 feast of the trumpet he said one pope dies another one descends yep one pope dies another one is sin that's what they do we just went up in a different one this time when the guy resigned he had no sense to step down he said getting old what i'm married for that let's see a succession just one after the other but what's the difference in that and you're voting for the baptist and got together not too long ago and then elected the president of the baptist association what's the difference no you don't get on down where we're at you want me to find you these quotes where there's no such thing as electing a pastor we do it here because of the governmental point of us being set up as a spoken word church incorporation so it's the legality of the court of the law we have to follow that vote each year for a pastor the brotherhood said there's no such thing as voting in the past you didn't vote paul to be the head did nobody vote for peter to be his spokesman on death pentecost right but you know they voted for brother brown and he said they could vote him in route but then he turned around and said there's no such thing as voting him see where would anybody get off of this that's silly we do a lot of things that are silly but we have to do for a lot of other things but where would you let the pastor from what is that well if we get 75 percent of the votes where's any such thing in the bible if you vote on me today as your pastor other than the legalities that we're going on the day i call for a vote if it's not 100 i will sit down that's right because there'll never be well then i guess i'd just sit down no problem because it would be the holy spirit you didn't have a bunch of cardinals running out and said i didn't get the guy i wanted because they blasphemous names tack anything on there and you got a name he's blessing you you say yeah but they're being christians he said that's where the problem was you want these quotes you're welcome too now i want to move on a little bit see in the 18th chapter it talks again of the mystery babylon or babylon you know the grade has fallen it's fallen right now to show you the compound meaning i hope you catch what i'm saying we are not here when the things happen we will read in a minute to this mystery babylon but you realize when your prophet stood out there with the word of god do you realize that if you truly i'm getting serious about it this is the message if you truly see the word of god you know you truly see one true and living god i don't mean like everybody else got on you know everybody no no i'm saying as you see it for your per you've been using it if you see one true living god you realize mr babylon has fallen for you this is for this evening so okay that's what i said we'll get on some good and leave this alone this is the point i want you to get if you can see the system of organized religion is wrong and yet still love the people and still fellowship with them and no problems you know and stuff if you can do that see then mystery babylon has fallen for you you're not the cage of ever unclean bird you're the body of jesus christ and i like what either rabbi richmond or gerson solomon one time said he said i can't have it god chose us now what good thing did you do that god chose you you know i could think of a lot of bad things that looked like he ought to throw me away don't you but yet he chose me at least to see the message amen that's right and after realizing put in there that many are called but what you were trying to man there's many calls of this message but there's only a few chosen to be the bride of christ and see in the end time as we'll get to it this evening if we don't prove amen that's it not to one another right right i know this is gonna hurt hard and you're gonna say it's wrong but go ahead we got to prove to god that we're his wife right there or we're not going to be his wife right we can joy jump and run around and be as bright right right claim to be christians right no difference between a bride and a wife you know even scofield says that right the adulterous israel that was put away can never come back to be his wife scofield says that he had enough knowledge he said because you can't be an adulterous system and come back to be pure correct all right so then we must come out yes to go in too that's right right we can be called out of the church system we can be called out of the messiness the baptist the presbyterians or whatever and set down to be this denomination just as denominational as we was while we there was there that's right amen the prophet said any idea that is contrary to god's revealed word amen but you see 18 4 now if you're following me 18 4 is a foundation or a proof that somebody has made yourself ready right chapter 19 as we'll get to it this evening if it says she's made her separated it don't go through any other things this is the going through the the things i'm getting ready to come out of her what about and we actually come out dirty we get our coat and hat and leave that's why you see a lot of jumping around and the people call the message people they'll come out until somebody says something they don't like right and when they do they'll walk out why bless god you ain't gonna tell me i'm the right crop okay but see if we can come away from ourselves we got them no notice no quotes we've come away from ourselves and get to saying the word is right let me follow that that's right and then we gotta settle this part of it too because you know everybody says they got to work right right that was the point one of those the bad just like they've got to mess with this thing they've got pressure or they wouldn't be that church the brand of mice think they had it right there's a little ice thing we got here we can tackle anybody around here let them preachers come in we'll we'll decide whether he's teaching the truth or not oh come on this is where we live right right one boy brother came in and preached one time two or three sisters jumped on him and the first thing he said yeah i know y'all got a teacher pastor portal fellow went away deep down you already been shamed yourself beating on him like that not for telling me it's wrong or anything you'll not be the fellow to death but listen church leave that to me let me handle it you want some quotes on that that fellow won't get on brother brown what do they do and you think brother brown was so sweet and unbelievable he was he was and all that brothers are speaking jump on that guy he said leave him alone he said because i wanted him listen church have we come out of him have we come out of her are we ready for a raptured ride because remember we got to go up before we can come down in revelation 19. and just remember in revelations 19 that's going to be all the bribe right that's going to be luther that taught a trinity right amen that's right man that's good brother that's right that's gonna be wesley that taught wrong doctrine right right amen that's gonna be the pentecostals with all they're doing are you gonna leave them out of 19 riding back but you see it if we don't tie in it doesn't say that luther and wesley and them have made their self ready right right it don't say the bride that's made herself right that's right because they are the bride that's right it says the why amen you know the one that's living right those are alive it's the one that's made ourselves ready right we've come through all of these things we've learned them out and seen they were wrong but come out of the right attitude not looking down on nobody i look down on people that don't want what i've got you know what i do i look down in tears i don't look down in anger i look down in tears because amen that's right for one thing i realized lord if i've got anything you gave it to me amen amen thank you jesus i didn't get it myself and study it out you gave it to me and i looked down at it and i said lord could you bring them yes up a little bit and wonderful people i don't look down on no organized religion or the people that's measured or anything no look down i pray all the time it's the lord that's my brothers and sisters i'm talking about natural and spiritual you know and they said i count them down right because like i've always said to you you're over there ridiculing somebody that walks by with him and that calling back you know you just get me in trouble all the time because we just come in the message and you know and they were just hearing dress and clothes and hiring shoes and you know that and we'd be in the store and they'd say yeah look at that over there with that short dress look at her look at her face being painted shut up boys see that's all they heard so that's talking about what to say okay but listen church if we're not above the dress and the clothes and things then we're not even christians that's right that's right we're not even bright right you want to get into martin luther and john wesley in their lives that's right when john wesley said it was he didn't have any calls for drinking black coffee he said cause it has no value it wasn't smith wigglesworth and one of them wouldn't even one wouldn't read a newspaper raised 17 people from the dead no one even read a newspaper don't get into lies and talk about it yeah but we're standing on people that live holy lives but like i'm saying revelation 19 is going to be the ride of luther wesley pentecost just as well as you and i right right but it's going to start off because in 19 they're about four or five or everyone goes down eight or something we'll get to it this scene says that lebron the wife has made herself if we don't get ready to go luther and them can't be raised that's right they without us that's right cannot be made perfect i believe that's right they can't come to a completion of a resurrection without you that's right and what a wonderful opportunity is going to be you know that everybody is hinged upon you and i am right that's right amen but think about it come out of her all right you want to read one more i didn't give it to them to read but brother joe can you brother anderson can you pull up verse 23 yeah can you pull up verse 23 let me talk for a second while they're getting there you say but brother dave you've taught us that we go up for one and we're not in 19 we're not in 18 and now you look like you put us 18. remember compound meaning remember we don't go up we don't come back we don't have it this afternoon if we don't get this morning all right read this where is it 23. coming all the way down gets destroyed watch what it says and the light of the candle she'll sign no more than all indeed that's an organized religion that's the oh motherhood that's a hard system it don't shine no more all right this little light of mine i'm going to let it shine but see when we go out of here there is no light right right right we're not dealing with 144 thousand right we're just dealing with the whole thing what and the voice of the bridegroom what america so that's not god's voice in there come on you see what i'm trying to lay down to get us to a point that's not god's voice out there when it's time to organize religion it's not god's voice in this message if you and i have anything contrary to the truth it's not god's voice he doesn't talk with forked tongue what says the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride she'll be heard no more and all indeed go in there and read 8 17 18 and look and find out this last part that the merchants were great men and they stand the way off you know because what's going to happen let's see if i get this in there okay go with number four brother joe brother anderson let's get number four and five and this half this i gave him two sets of notes okay he ain't kidding those who's got him they got two sets go ahead and pull up number four while it's getting there i'll give it to it's the mark of the beast 1954 513 look what your prophet says look what's going to happen to this system and if you give me one more night if god does i'll prove to you that communism is working straight in the hands of almighty god right now where we can read the book and remember i'll say this is god's prophet the russian empire will drop an atomic bomb or of some sort that's what everybody thinks it is of some sort on the vatican city and destroy it in one hour thus saith the lord and the bible said that god took them cruel hearted men and put them in his hands and they were instruments in his hands to fulfill his will and to bring back to her exactly what she had coming to her that's the word okay the ten virgins next number five priest in 1960 12-11 the bible said that god raised up communism to get revenge upon the nations for what they've done to the children of god i want you that's exactly right he said and they their power and everything to the beast for one hour into revenge of people of the blood that they had shed and when that atomic bomb or whatever it ears will strike that vatican city and the roman hierarchy would be no more and he said it was found in her the blood of all the martyrs says there's a bomb waiting for them said they're going to drop it in vatican or some way you see when this thing all winds up in the tribulation and the natural nation of israel that is in the covenant as i covered a while back with the antichrist that's right when that hope whoever he is walks into the temple of god showing himself to be as god stands there and proclaims who he is natural israel is going to reveal they're going to see they're wrong 144 000 never was in the covenant they're killed by the natural israelites right right they're killed by that they're two witness under 44 and they wind up realizing something went wrong and they're going to start raining down and when they do russia's gonna start raining them down we gonna start raining them down and everybody's gonna start raining them down what's left cause that's the battle of armageddon all right and read your bible there where it says even the merchants the people around them will stand back often no one's afraid to move in close because afraid they'll get bombed too because where's all the bombs gonna be pointing down the smoke stack where the white smoke went up the other day all the bombs is going to point to there going to blow that thing to smithereens and the bible says even the merchants will pull back read 18th chapter and it says that they will you know what it says that they've got gold and precious things but they're no longer of any value if you had a million dollar gold bar in your hand and you're hungry wouldn't be your problem to flop down your million-dollar bar right to get you a biscuit right the bible says it's of no value anymore we didn't teach out right but the mind and worst thing could be is what's the last the red the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride is heard no longer in here even though we get out of here those two witnesses which is our bridegroom we're gonna go over there you go in there and teach talk to them come on music but let's get out of that now get into the bride but just remember we're back up a little this afternoon if we haven't overcome all of these things that we've read then there will be no victorious rides into the millennium right see we don't get rid of our ideas and thoughts let me give you a thumb for this afternoon i ain't gonna write to raise the hands but how many of you believe that we're already married to jesus christ but henry believes it by being that we're not going to a marriage in the sky we're only going to have a wedding supper right that's the biggest portion of the people of the message but we don't read the bible where it says and his wife has made herself ready the marriage of the lamb has come right if we're married to him already why their marriage to the lamb you see we got it all figured out i'm quoting brother brown but you see i can quote him all i want over here that's right or i can quote him all one over here but when i bring it together it makes a beautiful picture that's right we're going to a marriage supper i've heard people even go to prove they over in israel they the wedding is first and then the marriage supper comes how many excuse me the the marriage i have i'll get to it this happened i got it written down but see everybody thinks that we're just going to some work to a marriage supper because we're all married we're getting married here that's a quote there's going to be a wedding in the sky now what are you going to do with it you see you can make it say anything you want to but the truth is the truth what have we got anybody have a need for six minutes put four servers into one today so they don't heading home he's gonna be gone we've tried our best to get her to stay out here and force him to come this way well let's just believe we're all gonna miss here in the name of jesus christ oh is oh foreign anybody else here we go oh
