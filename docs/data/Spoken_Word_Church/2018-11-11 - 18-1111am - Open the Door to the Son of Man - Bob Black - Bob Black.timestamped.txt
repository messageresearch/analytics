[7:45] morning I'm not used to opening up the
[7:47] Sunday morning service so I if I you
[7:50] know mess everything up y'all just show
[7:51] me some grace but I talked to brother
[7:54] waiting brother Dale this morning and
[7:56] they they made it their safe to Kentucky
[7:57] and playing it you know both ways
[8:00] appreciate brother Beiler's this morning
[8:02] so just remember the Eman and pray for
[8:05] them that everything will go well and
[8:06] then they're gonna go and apparently the
[8:10] forecast is for rain and they're wantin
[8:12] snow and I'm not really a hunter shot I
[8:14] understand how that works
[8:16] but we'll we'll just pray and believe
[8:17] for a little bit of snow instead of rain
[8:19] that everything will just work out and
[8:22] they'll come back bless that everybody
[8:24] will get exactly what they wanted to get
[8:26] then and as far as that goes and then
[8:30] today is Veterans Day and if you know
[8:35] you know we got Memorial Day which is
[8:37] celebrating the ones that had passed
[8:38] away in service and Veterans Day
[8:41] celebrates the ones that had served in
[8:43] the military so we just want to I
[8:44] believe actually so I don't miss anybody
[8:47] could you just raise your hand if you
[8:49] were veteran here I believe
[8:51] brother Colley brother Daugherty brother
[8:53] Joe all right and brother Johnny and
[8:57] brother dick are missing today brother
[8:59] brother Donnie went up there with him
[9:00] and brother dick is out cuz his wife is
[9:03] not feeling well today and he called us
[9:05] more than just to let us know so we will
[9:07] definitely remember them in prayer but
[9:09] thank the Lord for all the veterans that
[9:12] have have fought for our freedom and for
[9:14] all good things
[9:20] yes if if it wasn't for the ones that
[9:23] had gone before and and kind of gotten
[9:27] together with some when I preached last
[9:29] Sunday we were talking about how really
[9:31] you know in the gospel the ones that had
[9:33] gone before make it a whole lot easier
[9:34] for the young ones falling behind
[9:36] because they kind of paved the way and
[9:38] they take care of tackling all the all
[9:42] the hard stuff and and you know we're
[9:44] you know brother brother waiting brother
[9:46] they aren't here so I can talk about
[9:47] them I just really appreciate them so I
[9:50] don't even know if they're really ever
[9:52] understand how much I appreciate the the
[9:55] kind of like an old icebreaker goes
[9:57] through and you can follow behind and
[9:58] guess it gets everything all smooth out
[10:00] of the way so you just all you got to do
[10:02] is just yield to the Lord and you follow
[10:04] up kind of in their footsteps so we just
[10:06] we just think that thank the Lord for
[10:09] the ministry that he's given to us and
[10:11] for the word that he's given in this bag
[10:17] alright let's go to the to the word I'm
[10:20] gonna read this morning um did I see
[10:24] system Milko back there well praise a
[10:26] little sister milk oh you're gonna get
[10:28] to hear this again you gonna get a
[10:30] double-header because I preached this
[10:32] over there last Sunday so you get to
[10:36] hear it twice but we're going to read
[10:38] from Matthew 24 23 verse 23 to 33 and
[10:44] then revelation 3:20 but before we get
[10:46] into the word let's just go to the Lord
[10:48] in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to
[10:52] you Lord for the word that you've given
[10:53] unto us in this sight in this day and
[10:55] order we just
[10:56] Lord there's so many mysteries and
[10:59] things that seem kind of hard to probe
[11:01] it or but yet you've given them to us in
[11:04] our hands Lord and you've laid them in
[11:06] our lap and really the only thing for us
[11:08] to do Lord is just to open up the door
[11:10] of our heart and and to receive what
[11:12] you've given for us and I pray Lord that
[11:15] this morning in order may be something
[11:16] that be said to help somebody to just
[11:19] crack that door open a little just keep
[11:21] open it up until you have total
[11:23] preeminence in Lord as we were listening
[11:25] to that sermon that was playing before
[11:27] the service now I believe that you were
[11:29] working in continuity because you
[11:31] the prophets saying about how you won't
[11:33] they have preeminence in your people
[11:34] Lord of God help us this morning Lord
[11:37] Jesus to just open the eyes of our heart
[11:39] Lord God Lord we know Lord's usually
[11:41] said we've come together gathering
[11:43] together and what kind of gathering
[11:45] would it be if you weren't welcome here
[11:47] Lord and so we just welcome you Lord
[11:49] with with open hearts open arms
[11:51] everything just inviting you in to come
[11:53] and fellowship with us and we know
[11:55] you're here Lord because it the songs
[11:57] have been sung the atmospheres been set
[11:59] the little believers have brought their
[12:00] pillars of fire together together were
[12:03] uniting together in one great big pillar
[12:05] of fire and so we know that your we know
[12:07] that the promise has been fulfilled
[12:08] where you said that where the twos are
[12:11] three is together together you'd be with
[12:12] us we believe it Lord God now come now
[12:15] Lord Jesus and open up the word of our
[12:17] heart that we can be fair that we can
[12:19] receive Lord Jesus that you'd be
[12:21] revealed at us we pray and we ask it the
[12:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[12:26] I'm gonna take this off Matthew 24 yeah
[12:35] now I have I have preached this before
[12:38] several times but you know I think
[12:41] that's one thing ministers kind of kind
[12:43] of have a problem with sometimes if I
[12:45] preach it again you know but repetition
[12:47] helps us and you know that's one thing
[12:50] I'm kind of learning over the years is
[12:52] that we need it over and over and over
[12:54] to really seek Him and so maybe it'll
[12:58] appreciate a little different this time
[13:00] because you know you look back at your
[13:02] notes and you and and things just keep
[13:03] opening up probably at probably the
[13:05] moment I step off the platform it'll
[13:06] open up even more so it just keeps
[13:09] opening up and unfolding more and more
[13:11] and so let's just read along because I
[13:16] did I'm gonna take a little topic but
[13:18] this morning of a title of open the door
[13:23] to the Son of Man and Matthew 24 23 says
[13:28] then If any man shall say unto you lo
[13:29] here is Christ or there believe it not
[13:32] for there shall arise false Christ's and
[13:34] false prophets and shall show great
[13:36] signs and wonders insomuch that if it
[13:38] were possible they shall deceive the
[13:39] very elect
[13:40] we know brother Branham talked about how
[13:42] that was the Antichrist pointing you to
[13:44] the
[13:45] should look at the wrong thing where
[13:46] Christ is Christ Christ is going to be
[13:49] in his bride behold I have told you
[13:52] before wherefore if they shall say in dB
[13:55] until you behold he is in the desert go
[13:57] not forth behold he is in the secret
[13:59] chambers believe it not see identifying
[14:02] the wrong thing for is the Lightning
[14:04] cometh out of the east and Shina theeven
[14:06] under the west so shall also the coming
[14:08] of the Son of man be it Jesus talks a
[14:12] lot about the son of the coming of the
[14:14] Son of Man I'm a priestess this morning
[14:15] like you've never heard of the son of
[14:16] man before I'm just I'm just gonna lay
[14:19] it out cuz you know he talked an awful
[14:24] lot about the son of man and the son of
[14:25] man is a very mysterious thing because
[14:27] this is we have we've heard brother Dale
[14:29] and for the wait have explained us
[14:31] before that really appalled not only
[14:34] that none of the disciples and under the
[14:35] all down through the seven churches
[14:36] never really got into son of man
[14:38] couldn't couldn't talk about it that's a
[14:40] secret waiting for this day for you for
[14:42] it to be revealed to you and I here in
[14:44] this day for so ever the carcass is
[14:47] there will the eagle's be together
[14:49] together the fresh kill fresh kill of
[14:52] the word every day it just keeps getting
[14:55] better and better more and more
[14:57] unfolding immediately after the
[14:59] tribulation of those days shall the Sun
[15:01] be darkened and the moon shall not give
[15:02] her light and the stars shall fall from
[15:04] heaven and the powers of the heavens
[15:06] shall be shaken and then shall appear
[15:08] the sign of the Son of man in heaven and
[15:11] then shall all the tribes of the earth
[15:13] mourn and they shall see the Son of man
[15:15] coming in the clouds of heaven with
[15:16] power and great glory the Son of man
[15:19] coming it was this Son of man and he
[15:22] shall send His angels with a great sound
[15:24] of a trumpet and they shall gather
[15:25] together his elect from the four winds
[15:27] from one end of the heaven to the other
[15:29] which is exactly what's happened now
[15:32] we're coming from different places all
[15:33] gather in the gap because that's what
[15:35] that's what you've all come together
[15:36] this morning for as is hopefully to hear
[15:39] the word and that's what gathers you
[15:41] together is the word you heard the word
[15:42] and it brings you together you see and
[15:45] he shows and now learn a parable of the
[15:48] fig tree when his branch is yet tender
[15:50] and putteth forth leaves you know that
[15:52] summer is not so likewise ye when ye
[15:55] shall see all these things know that
[15:57] in the year even at the doors so there's
[16:00] doors there's a lot of different doors
[16:01] but I want to talk about this one
[16:02] particular door that involves a lot of
[16:04] different doors being opened let's talk
[16:07] let's look at revelation 3:20 I know
[16:11] we've heard this being preached a lot
[16:13] but you know like like Matthew Mark Luke
[16:15] and John all preached Jesus different
[16:17] little ways I maybe look turn it a
[16:19] little bit different and maybe it'll be
[16:21] helpful for you this morning
[16:22] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[16:25] any man hear my voice and open the door
[16:28] I will come in to him and will sup with
[16:30] him and he with me you may be seated the
[16:33] Lord is a blessing to the earth was
[16:35] reading the word behold I stand at the
[16:40] door and knock If any man hear my voice
[16:42] and open the door I will come in to him
[16:44] and will sup with him and he with me and
[16:46] sup means to come in and have communion
[16:49] with you and open up the word and reveal
[16:50] himself to you that's what's happening
[16:52] today well you know brother Branham
[16:53] preached just from faith all the way to
[16:55] communion from faced Communion and if
[16:59] you look at the statue of a perfect man
[17:00] that's the whole journey of a Christian
[17:02] from faith to communion because of
[17:04] communion the word is open up to you
[17:06] fully and and and God has that second
[17:09] fold he asked prettiman SAT and so
[17:11] that's that mystery I'm just gonna lay
[17:13] it out exactly the way I believe it know
[17:15] it that mystery that's been waiting to
[17:17] be revealed all down through the ages
[17:18] that capstone revelation of the
[17:20] preeminence of God in the church is that
[17:23] capstone revelation now you the the the
[17:26] revelation of the Son of God has been
[17:28] preached down through seven Church ages
[17:30] but now in this end time God sent he
[17:32] came himself because that's what the
[17:34] shout the voice in the Trump was God
[17:35] Himself would come down with a message
[17:37] to turn the hearts of the father that
[17:39] turn turn the hearts of the children
[17:40] back to the original Pentecostal faith
[17:42] of the father's so you know you hear
[17:44] brother Branham say a lot of strange
[17:46] things like you know he begins to talk
[17:48] about his tight we're turning a corner
[17:50] now and you know that kind of blows
[17:52] people's minds that we're turning a
[17:53] corner not turning a corner who says
[17:55] we're turning a corner well but the
[17:57] prophet of God said we're turning the
[17:59] corner he said say strange things like
[18:01] you know I'd rather live in this time
[18:03] than any other time why would why would
[18:06] he say that this time when it looks like
[18:09] it looks like the church is getting
[18:10] bombarded from every direction and and
[18:13] the true believer is getting trimmed
[18:15] down into a smaller and smaller minority
[18:18] and everything is getting smaller and
[18:20] smaller so many people are falling away
[18:21] but yet there's gonna be a true bride
[18:23] that's gonna that's gonna receive the
[18:25] word for her day and accept it and
[18:27] become God revealed in a human flesh you
[18:31] know I I was talking to another brother
[18:33] recently about how years ago that even
[18:35] that that kind of that kind of preaching
[18:38] would be received as what are you what
[18:41] are you talking about brother by a
[18:42] brother who ever was would be saying it
[18:44] john 14:29 that day you shall know that
[18:47] i my father one that i am in you and you
[18:51] and me and i'm and you know how it goes
[18:54] everything's all wrapped up together and
[18:57] you'll know who you'll know who you are
[18:58] you'll know who he is and and just say
[19:00] that god will be inside of you dwelling
[19:03] inside of you that it just kind of
[19:05] boggles your mind but yet we know we
[19:09] know just by looking around at the signs
[19:11] of the times that what what's going on
[19:13] in this day that something's taking
[19:14] place
[19:15] you know you think about those all the
[19:17] different prophecies that brother
[19:19] Branham talked about that things would
[19:20] begin to transpire as as things as the
[19:23] word will begin to unfold it would have
[19:25] an effect on the world that the devil is
[19:27] doing something at the same time there
[19:29] are all those different prophecies of
[19:30] the of the electric cars coming into
[19:32] being and and how you know years ago we
[19:35] think that that God that they'd have to
[19:38] like run a track down in the middle of
[19:39] the road but now you can see you can see
[19:42] it more clearly that it's that Google
[19:45] and different cars Teslin and they're
[19:47] putting GPS devices in the cars so that
[19:50] they don't have to have a track in the
[19:51] road but they can run without without
[19:53] wires within it without any of those
[19:55] kind of things and it just keeps
[19:57] unfolding because things keep moving
[19:59] that's just exactly how the gospel is it
[20:01] the gospel keeps unfolding as you keep
[20:03] getting into it little layers come off
[20:05] and you begin to see more and more as it
[20:08] has an effect on you and you talked
[20:11] about how that prophecy of how Nazism
[20:13] and fascism will move into communism and
[20:15] and we can see that coming to pass today
[20:17] as well and the Worman rule in America
[20:20] that you know I they sent me an out my
[20:21] work sent me down to
[20:23] Orlando a few weeks ago maybe a month or
[20:25] so ago for working to go to a conference
[20:28] and all during that conference they they
[20:31] kept it's putting so much emphasis on
[20:33] women leadership women women their
[20:35] special groups for women and special
[20:37] groups for that well I so much special
[20:39] focus on women because because in the
[20:42] natural that's there's a special focus
[20:43] on women but in their spiritual God is
[20:46] putting a special focus on his bride
[20:48] because she's the one that's going to
[20:50] fulfill that new test all the new
[20:51] testament scriptures are going to be
[20:53] wound up in you and i got to be careful
[20:56] i'ma get on this afternoon's message
[20:58] because this afternoon I would be
[21:00] speaking on the New Testament for field
[21:02] and where does that fulfill that so you
[21:05] can see all of these things bringing
[21:07] right up to America and ruins at all
[21:10] these things being moving up so you can
[21:12] see just by looking at the natural that
[21:14] what something has got to be taking
[21:16] place and what's taking place is God is
[21:18] having a preeminence and as a bride he
[21:21] there's something spiritual that's
[21:22] happening something spiritual that took
[21:24] place that that caused man to even start
[21:27] thinking about going to the moon to
[21:29] leave the earth because God's got
[21:31] spiritual astronauts that are fixing to
[21:32] leave this earth and you know you start
[21:35] thinking I'm going to leave this one of
[21:36] these days I'm gonna leave this earth
[21:37] you can't leave that you're not gonna
[21:39] leave this earth just because you want
[21:40] to just because you you said it in your
[21:42] mind that it would be a good idea for me
[21:44] to leave this earth I think the rapture
[21:46] is a good idea but you have to open up
[21:48] the door to the son of man and receive
[21:50] that son of man in Revelation that's the
[21:52] secret that's the key to leaving the
[21:54] earth you say well I think it'll be a
[21:56] grand idea
[21:57] I have us grand notion that that you
[22:00] know that's how a lot of people in the
[22:01] message today they sit in message
[22:03] churches and they say because I'm
[22:05] hearing the message because I'm here
[22:07] around it that's what brother Branham
[22:09] got onto you on the token message if you
[22:10] want to go back and listen to the token
[22:12] just because you around the message does
[22:14] not mean that the message is in you just
[22:16] because you're around and you talk about
[22:18] the rapture does not mean that that
[22:20] you're going to take a rapture there's a
[22:22] secret to take a rapture and it's not
[22:24] just that you got born again there's a
[22:26] secret to going straight from from
[22:28] walking around to to having your body
[22:31] changed and that's
[22:33] secret that god himself came down and
[22:35] spoke through a prophet and preached
[22:37] from 1963 on that message yeah I
[22:40] understand not not in the years of
[22:42] preparation not in the years leading up
[22:44] to that because when brother Branham
[22:46] preached his spoken word is the original
[22:48] seed he said there's something there's
[22:49] something else that's got to come he
[22:51] said that Malachi 4:5 6 has not yet been
[22:54] fulfilled modify Malachi 4:5 6 says that
[22:58] there's going to be a man come to preach
[23:00] the return back to the original face to
[23:03] preach that original face first that
[23:06] that message had to be preached to
[23:08] return back to the original faith and
[23:10] now it's up to you and I to receive that
[23:12] that's the second fold of the threefold
[23:15] mystery of Christ revealed in his church
[23:17] the second folders you receive that you
[23:19] receive that word and you become the
[23:21] word so that God has preeminence in you
[23:23] and that's what the Son of Man
[23:25] revelation is the son of man is not just
[23:27] part word we're brother I'm said in this
[23:29] in the seven churches they dipped into
[23:31] the into the Son of God revelation they
[23:33] dipped into it a little bit that through
[23:35] Martin Luther preached to justification
[23:37] and they dipped into a little bit they
[23:38] had just a little bit understanding John
[23:40] Wesley dipped into it they had a little
[23:42] bit more understanding of sanctification
[23:43] where where Luther occurred what John
[23:46] Wesley could look at at scriptures like
[23:47] there in Thessalonians where it said he
[23:49] didn't entirely sanctify you and he
[23:51] didn't quite have a perfect
[23:53] understanding of what that
[23:53] sanctification was the sanctification of
[23:56] the Spirit what God had come to cleanse
[23:59] you and make you walk like you and what
[24:01] like him and talk like like you and like
[24:04] human and all those things but but not
[24:07] just dipping into this into a son of God
[24:10] now we've come beyond that into where
[24:13] the God can reveal himself in the full
[24:15] preeminence have total control over the
[24:18] individual and by total control I mean
[24:21] down on the inside of you got--he's
[24:22] redeems your soul down on the inside he
[24:25] redeems your soul that faith that's
[24:26] Galatians 120 because he puts his life
[24:29] inside of you he puts it I know I don't
[24:31] live the life I live I live by the faith
[24:34] of the Son of God I live by his faith
[24:36] because when you get born again he gives
[24:39] you his faith and that becomes you
[24:41] become like a little solar system with
[24:42] that Sun down on the inside a son
[24:45] inside because to quote control
[24:47] everything it starts having control and
[24:49] it begins to work its way out so that
[24:52] the planets all of your your five senses
[24:55] your memory reason constants affection
[24:57] they begin to be under control to that
[24:59] to that Sun down on the inside lip
[25:01] against a movie you begin to cast down
[25:03] reads and you begin to say I don't when
[25:05] that that carnal that carnal thought
[25:07] which is enmity with the Word of God
[25:09] because they rise up and say it's not
[25:10] it's not possible for you to be God it's
[25:13] not possible for God to dwell on the
[25:14] inside of you begin to gas down reason
[25:16] with things that work come up and you
[25:18] get you get laid off and whatever guy I
[25:20] know that God he's Jehovah Jireh I know
[25:22] he's still able to provide he's still
[25:24] able to give me a job because he said
[25:26] he'll not leave he'll not forsake us
[25:28] he'll not leave us I've never seen the
[25:30] righteous forsaken or begging bread and
[25:32] so that that faith begins to work out
[25:35] from you and and then the whole the holy
[25:38] the Holy Ghost is what sealing it all in
[25:41] together but yet there's something
[25:42] missing there's something missing when
[25:44] brother Branham preached the smoking
[25:45] world his original seed he said there's
[25:47] something something else has to happen
[25:49] there's got to be a third pool open up
[25:51] because when brother Brandt preached the
[25:53] third pool he went through the third
[25:55] pool and I'm just gonna be real playing
[25:59] I hope I'm not blowing anybody's mind
[26:00] this morning this is the third pool
[26:03] because you go through three pools your
[26:05] own self you there's three pools of your
[26:07] journey just like there were three pools
[26:08] of brother Browns journey just like
[26:10] there were three pools of Noah's journey
[26:11] and three pools of Moses journey and
[26:13] three pools of Abraham's journey and
[26:15] three pools of Jesus's journey they all
[26:17] went through three pools and you've got
[26:19] to go through three pools that's the
[26:21] only way that you can know who is this
[26:22] Melchizedek basis because you've gone
[26:24] through that same journey that
[26:25] Melchizedek went through you go through
[26:28] the same thing and then you can be
[26:29] identified with him you can have that
[26:31] same kind of understanding because
[26:33] you've gone through three pools but
[26:35] there's got to be something happening
[26:36] for you to go for that three put that
[26:38] third pool open up to you that what
[26:41] happens is that God sent a message the
[26:43] son of man message to open up everything
[26:45] to open up what the doors in the door is
[26:47] open up with the true baptism of the
[26:49] Holy Ghost is their token token Christ
[26:52] the mystery of God revealed what the
[26:53] what the message
[26:54] what the message is all about and that
[26:57] that open that when you would get into
[26:58] this into the messages preached after
[27:00] the seals then the word begins to open
[27:03] up to you it becomes it begins to come
[27:05] become a living reality to you and
[27:08] that's what you've got to open up the
[27:10] door to the son of man when you open up
[27:12] the door of the Son of Man that the son
[27:14] of man begins to be revealed at you but
[27:16] you have to open up that door I ain't
[27:21] even looked at my nose you got to open
[27:28] up the it's uh it's left up to you you
[27:31] know you know brother branham he talked
[27:33] about how that that the devil's giving
[27:35] you a vote he votes that you not gonna
[27:38] believe it
[27:38] and God voted for you that you will
[27:40] believe it and it's left up to you to
[27:42] whether you go which way you're gonna
[27:44] vote it's up it's up to you
[27:46] God's not gonna override your free moral
[27:49] agency
[27:50] he's not gonna override your freewill
[27:52] you're not like a plan or a mountain or
[27:54] a thing where I could just speak to and
[27:56] say let it move let it let it do because
[27:59] he won't he won't just speak to you like
[28:01] that he'll speak to you through the lips
[28:04] of a man behind the pulpit but you're
[28:05] different than a plan or a mountain or
[28:07] or a river or something you have to open
[28:10] up the door yourself you've got to get
[28:12] into the word and find out what it says
[28:15] you know and I don't wanna I want to say
[28:18] something encourage I want to be
[28:19] encouraged and identifying to you
[28:21] because when you do open up the door
[28:23] when you open up the door to the
[28:25] capstone revelation then that capstone
[28:27] revelation becomes revealed in you it
[28:30] becomes alive in you when you begin to
[28:33] see what what the Prophet is really
[28:35] talking about and I believe that's what
[28:38] the fivefold ministry will sit for the
[28:40] fivefold ministry was sent for the
[28:43] edifying of the church what does that
[28:45] mean the edifying of the church it means
[28:47] when people come to church they sit they
[28:49] sit around and they begin to get in
[28:51] their mind well they're the born-again
[28:53] experiences all it takes
[28:54] I'm born again and and that's all there
[28:57] is to it here I sit and I believe the
[29:00] message I believe that God sent a
[29:01] prophet but there's more than that to it
[29:04] because
[29:04] brother Brown said that you're born
[29:06] again and then you're baptized into the
[29:09] body you know what does that mean you're
[29:11] baptized into the body that means that
[29:12] you come through from glory unto glory
[29:15] through stages that bad the baptism of
[29:18] the Holy Ghost is the revelation to you
[29:20] it's as it's revealed God takes you up
[29:22] higher and higher from from a loop a low
[29:25] point from a little child from a little
[29:27] baby where you can t you don't even know
[29:29] how to turn the keys you don't know how
[29:31] to drive the car and he build you up and
[29:33] build you up until you know what to do
[29:35] with the word that's what the son of man
[29:38] revelation is it somebody that know that
[29:40] God can trust what to do with the word
[29:43] you know you know we we all want to get
[29:48] into the speaking condition we want to
[29:50] get into back take us back to where Adam
[29:52] could speak to the mountains speak to
[29:54] the stream and it would obey Him
[29:55] whatever comes out of his mouth would
[29:57] what would come to pass like brother man
[29:59] I was speaking to the squirrels speak to
[30:01] the wind speak to the waves but how
[30:03] could you do that if God can't trust you
[30:05] with it God's not gonna give that kind
[30:07] of authority to a little baby that can't
[30:09] don't even know what to do with the car
[30:10] keys but he's gonna he's got a he's got
[30:12] a he's got to train you and make sure
[30:14] that you are a mature Christian and
[30:17] maturity does not come through
[30:19] psychology it doesn't come through no
[30:21] morality book somewhere you know people
[30:24] tried today trying to find a way to get
[30:26] their home life straightened up to get
[30:28] there all the problems in life through
[30:30] through psychological books and whatnot
[30:32] if you get into the capstone revelation
[30:34] and straighten up your home life and
[30:36] straighten up your personal life and
[30:38] straighten everything up
[30:39] you don't need psychology all need
[30:42] morality what you need is the risen
[30:44] Christ the resurrected Savior in your
[30:46] life it is the rising of the Sun and
[30:49] he's risen this is the rising of the Sun
[30:51] where the light would come to the top of
[30:53] the tree and it wouldn't it would show
[30:54] forth its glory in his church and his
[30:57] bride it's the rising of the Sun because
[31:00] he's risen he's taking you from from a
[31:03] little baby for him what he's redeemed
[31:05] your soul on up through the second pool
[31:07] the redemption of the spirit and now
[31:09] it's time for you to catch the
[31:12] revelation of the redemption of your
[31:13] body to win the adopt
[31:16] it's Adoption time you know when brother
[31:18] branham when he talked about things like
[31:20] that when he would say those strange
[31:21] sayings like it's bride time it throws
[31:25] people for a loop it's bride time it
[31:28] what does that mean it's time that the
[31:30] bride is catching the revelation of this
[31:32] hour in the revelation of this hour is a
[31:35] resurrection revelation the voice of the
[31:38] resurrection the voice of the redemption
[31:39] of the body because we're the son of man
[31:42] is death cannot abide with a son of man
[31:45] when the son of man is around death as
[31:48] god somebody's got to come up from the
[31:50] grave when the when the voice of the
[31:52] resurrection is sounding and the lives
[31:54] of the people because the voice of the
[31:56] blood has a voice when his life is
[31:58] sounding forth in you when it's speaking
[32:01] out the others something's got to happen
[32:04] how can death abide in the son of when
[32:07] the presence of the son of man when the
[32:09] Son of Man is revealed in his people
[32:11] somebody's going to come up from the
[32:13] grave that's the message of the hour
[32:23] your brother might have said it's
[32:25] Adoption time it's adoption time what
[32:28] does that mean that means that he's took
[32:30] you to you from this little baby form
[32:31] adoption where you were you were walking
[32:34] around and seeing didn't know anything
[32:36] about a Gentile with the the the
[32:40] apostles and and things that it's a
[32:42] column barbarians not knowing anything
[32:44] about the scripture not having any
[32:45] understanding of what what salvation is
[32:48] not not having an understanding
[32:49] understanding of the of the genealogies
[32:52] that he talked about but yeah he adopted
[32:54] us into this body he pulled us out he
[32:56] called us out and adopted us into the
[32:58] family but now he's drawing us up into a
[33:01] place where you you're a mature
[33:03] Christian and not not tossed about by
[33:05] every wind of doctrine not tossed about
[33:07] by air every time somebody a preacher
[33:10] out on the internet says something
[33:11] strange whatnot I believe it's coming
[33:13] time now where we know where we stand we
[33:15] know who we are
[33:16] and when the bride begins to realize who
[33:18] she is she becomes an invincible army
[33:20] why because she knows the tricks of the
[33:22] devil she knows what the devil's up to
[33:24] she knew that she can die
[33:26] she's identified with the scripture for
[33:28] her day and she knows the hour that
[33:30] she's living in and brother Brennan
[33:34] would say something like it's harvest
[33:35] time because that quart of weed has been
[33:37] planted and it's grown through seven
[33:39] Church ages and now it's come to
[33:40] maturity now the little art is being
[33:43] baked out into the light of the Sun
[33:45] until every green is baked out and you
[33:48] know you look at a wheat plant being
[33:50] maturing out there in the Sun and the
[33:51] light of the sun shining on it bakes it
[33:54] and it gets harder and harder and harder
[33:56] that little wheat kernel is able to
[33:58] withstand but something happens in the
[34:00] shuck the shuck can't stand it anymore
[34:03] and it pulls away that's that's what's
[34:06] happening now I believe the shuck is
[34:07] pulling away and when the shut pulls
[34:09] away then the bride could really come
[34:12] into her full manifestation she can't
[34:14] come into full manifestation until the
[34:16] shut pulls away but when the shuck pulls
[34:18] away and all of the green is baked out
[34:20] of it then you'll see something happen
[34:22] then you'll see then you'll see a true
[34:25] anointing
[34:25] I believe that's what brother Dale's
[34:27] been preaching on about how you want to
[34:29] see you want to see that that revival
[34:32] get the word back in get that Saru
[34:36] bubble built up the temple he he he got
[34:39] everything he took what had already been
[34:41] preached and said well now this is a
[34:43] little bit out of place this goes over
[34:45] here this goes over here and he got the
[34:47] foundation leaf but now it's time to get
[34:50] that word get the art back into the
[34:53] temple and then you'll see the pillar of
[34:56] fire come back in then you'll see an
[34:58] anointed Church then you'll see but what
[35:01] we need to do we need to make sure that
[35:03] the ground is all tilled up that we're
[35:06] ready so that that that son of man
[35:09] capstone word will have a play a place
[35:12] of good ground to fall into a good
[35:16] ground and I know I know how this kind
[35:21] of preaching is we were talking about
[35:23] last Sunday about how years ago you come
[35:27] around to the messaging and several of
[35:30] us were about how everything just seems
[35:32] like you almost don't even know what
[35:34] what they're talking about what what are
[35:36] they talking about but you just keep
[35:38] Word
[35:39] word world on top of word and she keeps
[35:41] building until the word begins to unfold
[35:44] and you begin to have an understanding
[35:45] you begin to have a revelation of what's
[35:47] taking place and so if it just sounds
[35:50] very mysterious to this this morning I
[35:52] assure you just keep hanging on just
[35:55] keep hanging on because it will keep
[35:57] unfolding to you and what what we're
[36:02] after though what we're after what we're
[36:04] in this for is the redemption of the
[36:07] body so keep hanging on until that
[36:09] capstone revelation keep unfolds to you
[36:12] and get into that that's that's where
[36:14] the focus is let me drink some water
[36:19] here everybody doing all right and
[36:32] Matthew 24 says so likewise ye when you
[36:35] shall see all these things know that it
[36:37] is near even at the doors even at the
[36:40] door because you know you think about
[36:41] down when the children of Israel were
[36:43] down in Egypt there's God takes us
[36:45] through doors he takes us from one
[36:47] transition to the other from one place
[36:50] to another from one place in our
[36:51] spiritual journey to another you see
[36:53] that down there in Egypt they they had
[36:55] to go through a door to come out through
[36:57] a door they had to go into that door
[36:59] that was covered over the Lamb blood to
[37:01] come out through that red seed door to
[37:03] be able to come out through death and so
[37:06] God took them from one door to another
[37:08] through the Red Sea on until they got to
[37:10] Kadish Barnea and Katie smart knee oh
[37:12] well you could say that's a door where
[37:14] they they stood there at the door to the
[37:16] promised land but yet they closed the
[37:19] doors of their heart and they said it's
[37:21] not for us how are we supposed to go and
[37:23] take the land when there's giants in the
[37:25] land after all the things that they had
[37:27] seen after all the things that they had
[37:29] witnessed God doing after all the things
[37:32] that they had witness they they failed
[37:35] to go through this door into the
[37:39] promised land this is the promised land
[37:41] into this door over this over this
[37:45] breach into the promised land from
[37:47] sevens from sevens into an eight
[37:52] I hope I'm not blowing anybody much this
[37:58] has been priests for for years and years
[38:01] and I how how could they so they got to
[38:07] keenest Barnea and and and they stopped
[38:09] at that door they failed to keep going
[38:12] on and and and so that God had to had to
[38:15] raise up another generation to be able
[38:17] to take that word and and carry out
[38:20] because you see what a Dory is a door is
[38:22] a separator when you go through this
[38:24] door when you go through each of these
[38:27] doors it separates you from from the
[38:30] world that if the love it for the love
[38:32] of the world's in you the love of God is
[38:34] not even in you so as you go through
[38:37] these doors it separates you more and
[38:40] more and more from the world until the
[38:42] final separation you step through that
[38:44] door you overcome death death the last
[38:46] is the last enemy to be destroyed and
[38:48] you step through that door and escape
[38:50] the bonds of the earth but what what God
[38:53] is doing is he's taking us through these
[38:55] doors and you know how the message works
[38:57] each of these doors had a porter there
[39:00] to stand to stand so that you hear the
[39:02] message of that day as Irena has
[39:04] preached he was the porter for that day
[39:06] and he preached his message and he
[39:08] opened the door of deliverance so that
[39:11] they could step through out of that
[39:12] church age out of that age into into the
[39:17] being part of the body because God is
[39:20] building his body he's building his body
[39:23] through the preaching of the gospel and
[39:25] so they would have hear that message of
[39:27] that age of arrhenius and it would open
[39:30] up a door and other people of Ministers
[39:33] the five-o ministers would catch that
[39:35] revelation of arrhenius and they would
[39:37] preach it in their little churches all
[39:39] their little simple he's all around and
[39:41] so the ones that hurt they're preaching
[39:43] to step through that door because they
[39:46] were preaching not their own doctrine
[39:48] but they were preaching the same message
[39:49] that they heard Irina's preaching so
[39:52] when we get to this we're not preaching
[39:54] something different
[39:56] everybody thinks to five-foot ministry
[39:58] is preaching their own ideas that we've
[40:00] gone beyond the preaching their brother
[40:02] and we're not preaching something
[40:03] different we've
[40:04] and what he has preached we received it
[40:07] to ourselves that I believe become the
[40:10] word so that we can preach it back out
[40:12] again
[40:12] and then others can also receive and
[40:15] become that word too so you know really
[40:18] if you don't believe in the fivefold
[40:19] ministry I wonder if you believe that
[40:21] somebody come become the word I believe
[40:23] that you believe I wonder if you believe
[40:26] that anybody couldn't receive the voice
[40:28] for their day and even in the
[40:30] supermarket or even at work or whatever
[40:31] if anybody is able to speak that word
[40:34] and call somebody's life to be changed
[40:37] the preaching of the gospel is the
[40:38] highest form of worship because it's
[40:41] taken it's taken the message and it's
[40:43] preaching it out that others can receive
[40:45] it and become that word and so as they
[40:48] as they preach that word and each agent
[40:51] open up a door and open up a door as
[40:53] they preached it at the end of the end
[40:56] of the previous age and it opened up a
[40:58] door that the others in that age could
[41:00] come through and and in the next stage
[41:03] so Irena has preached at the end of Paul
[41:05] open-up authority and and the ones that
[41:08] received that would become that word for
[41:11] their day until you get to this this day
[41:13] where brother Branham here he's standing
[41:15] and he preaches and spoken word as the
[41:17] original seed something's got to happen
[41:20] Malachi 4:5 6 has not yet been fulfilled
[41:23] it's got to be fulfilled because all of
[41:26] these people standing here something's
[41:28] got to be preached to turn them back to
[41:31] their original faith of the father's to
[41:33] the original faith and what's got to
[41:36] happen is that God was send a third pull
[41:38] message a third pull message to turn
[41:41] your heart back and to literally turn
[41:44] you to literally turn you so that the
[41:47] head could come down and he would have
[41:49] total preeminence over his body
[41:51] total preeminence over you and so when
[41:54] he preached that word it was not just
[41:56] for you to say I believe that he
[41:58] preached it I believe that God sent a
[42:00] prophet but it was preached for you to
[42:02] receive it and to eat it and to eat that
[42:05] body word of the son of man because
[42:07] jesus said except he eat my flesh and
[42:10] drink my blood except you eat my flesh
[42:14] and that blood is inside of you the
[42:17] token
[42:17] life identifiers you with that word
[42:20] living out through you speaking through
[42:22] you a lift voice speaking the gospel out
[42:26] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[42:28] blood you have no life in you except you
[42:32] eat that body word of the son of man and
[42:35] what will the son of man give the body
[42:38] word eating the body word of the son of
[42:40] man will give you will bring the
[42:43] preeminence to the bride Oh understand
[42:48] what I'm saying this the son of man is
[42:50] not just one individual the bride as a
[42:54] whole was gonna fulfill the son of man
[42:55] the bride because look when the when the
[42:58] head come this is why when Jesus was
[43:00] down in the tomb he he didn't bundle all
[43:02] of the his garments together when he
[43:05] rose from the grave he took he took the
[43:08] part that covered his body and laid it
[43:10] over to the side go back in the
[43:11] scripture and see if it says that then
[43:13] he took the part they covered his head
[43:14] and laid it over to the side because
[43:16] that represented the entire body and
[43:19] when the head comes to the body then it
[43:21] will draw the rest of the body from the
[43:24] grave because the word is attracted to
[43:26] the word like a magnet the only when the
[43:29] word comes and is expressed in
[43:31] individuals the only thing that can
[43:33] happen it's going to be a natural
[43:34] reaction the voice on earth will draw
[43:37] all the dead in Christ from the ground
[43:38] and it will live and walk and so you
[43:41] know when you see when you begin it when
[43:43] the son of man revelation because they
[43:44] open up to you I believe we should be
[43:47] turning in our seats to look for the
[43:48] dead ones they have gone on because one
[43:51] of these mornings between 6:00 and 9:00
[43:52] you'll turn and you'll see the ones
[43:54] you'll see brother Garrett sitting next
[43:56] to you you'll see you'll see the ones
[43:59] that have gone on sitting next to you
[44:01] and what why is it going to happen
[44:04] because you have eaten the body word of
[44:06] the Son of Man you have opened up the
[44:10] door and who's the door the Bible says
[44:16] that he is the door there's got to be
[44:18] something there's got to be something to
[44:20] open up that door right he is the door
[44:23] and faith is the key that opens up the
[44:25] door and we know that faith comes by
[44:28] hearing faith comes by hearing the word
[44:30] and so what
[44:31] what unlocked each of these doors as the
[44:35] porter preached his a message and the
[44:37] door was open to them a way of escape
[44:39] out of each church age the message of
[44:41] the day the message of the hour received
[44:43] gave each generation face that gave them
[44:47] faith and it allowed them to unlock the
[44:49] door but what about this door what about
[44:53] the door what about the door of death
[44:55] what about the door of the rapture
[44:57] what's going to open up that door is
[44:59] that perfect revelation of who Jesus
[45:01] Christ is the Bible said in John chapter
[45:05] 10 they said in Jesus then said Jesus
[45:08] unto them again verily verily I say unto
[45:10] you I am the door of the Sheep all that
[45:13] ever came before me are thieves and
[45:15] robbers but the Sheep did not hear them
[45:17] I am the door but By Me If any man enter
[45:20] in he shall be Schade saved and shall go
[45:23] in and out and find pasture the son of
[45:26] man is the door and this whole thing is
[45:29] the son of man that's why in Revelation
[45:31] it says that John heard a voice and he
[45:33] turned to see the voice and he saw one
[45:36] like the Son of man walking through the
[45:38] seven golden candlesticks it's been the
[45:40] son of man all the time but he came in a
[45:43] son of God dispensation because they
[45:45] couldn't understand that that capstone
[45:47] revelation had not come so they only had
[45:50] a partial understanding of who he was
[45:52] that it could not completely understand
[45:55] who he is but now you and I can because
[45:57] the capstone revelation has come and you
[46:00] can understand him from Genesis all the
[46:02] way to Revelation you can know the
[46:04] beginning from the end you can know what
[46:06] happened in Genesis what caused the fall
[46:07] and you can know how the New Testament
[46:10] will be fulfilled in the book of
[46:11] Revelation you can see you can read it
[46:14] all the seals have become an open book
[46:16] to us every the seals is what makes is
[46:18] it an open book because what are the
[46:20] seals do the seals unveiled Jesus Christ
[46:22] the seals
[46:23] turn off reveal the whole body word
[46:26] everything that God has done everything
[46:28] that he has done for you every day I the
[46:31] whole redemptive plan everything that he
[46:33] has done to redeem the world it's all
[46:35] torn off so that you can see plainly who
[46:38] he is here's the door and faith opens
[46:42] the door
[46:43] but you know a lot of times the Bible
[46:46] the Bible warns of those that would keep
[46:48] the door shut they the Bible says that
[46:51] you you don't go in yourself and you
[46:53] don't allow others to go in you start
[46:56] thinking about what that really means
[46:58] he starts thinking about what that means
[47:01] and the day of Iranians you had people
[47:04] that would not receive the message for
[47:06] their day but they said they were
[47:07] believers surely you did the the history
[47:11] bears record of that fact and we know
[47:14] that's the case today
[47:15] false prophets was arise and they would
[47:18] begin to say things like you don't you
[47:20] don't need to go to church you don't
[47:21] need to hear the the word for your day
[47:23] you don't need to open up the door of
[47:25] your heart and so they would they would
[47:27] by not they didn't go in they didn't go
[47:29] in and they shut the way for others by
[47:31] not receiving the word for their day and
[47:33] so you can see how by the preaching
[47:35] preaching can either shut the door open
[47:38] the door
[47:38] preaching can open up the door by by
[47:41] preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ
[47:43] to the people so that they can receive
[47:45] something for their selves or it can
[47:47] shut the door where nobody is a it's
[47:50] just the door to the opening of that
[47:52] revelation we're still doing all right
[48:01] it's my prayer I I hope I'm not blowing
[48:03] anybody's mind or anything but I believe
[48:05] this is the truth I believe that I
[48:07] believe that the the minister is called
[48:10] to preach the truth and I believe it's
[48:11] for anybody young or old I you know
[48:13] that's one thing I don't agree with us
[48:15] that that little children need to have a
[48:17] little watered down version of the
[48:19] gospel I believe that everybody can hear
[48:21] the deep truth of the gospel you know
[48:23] these are these children and whatnot you
[48:25] know you look at the things of this
[48:26] world they go out and and and begin to
[48:28] know the depths of Satan you know it's
[48:31] got about got to where today you can go
[48:33] out on the internet and find that you
[48:35] know when I was in high school I you
[48:36] know it was pretty bad but now you can
[48:39] know you can learn about pretty much
[48:41] anything the devil can think of there's
[48:44] somebody out there willing to manifest
[48:45] it and and the Internet is full of that
[48:48] stuff and now you know the kids and the
[48:50] young people everybody can go out there
[48:52] and and learn about the depths of Satan
[48:54] well I believe it's also possible to
[48:56] learn about the death
[48:57] of God you know brother branham preached
[48:59] about he said if a man is able to
[49:01] disable two to fully give themselves
[49:04] over to the devil until the devil's
[49:06] working in them and fulfilling his his
[49:09] dastardly plans and so forth well God is
[49:11] able to fully take over an individual as
[49:13] well and the way he does it by the by
[49:16] the preaching of the gospel so I believe
[49:18] well you know the way I try to do it
[49:21] with my children and whatnot when we
[49:22] gather around used to used to you know
[49:25] that you just had kind of a enough light
[49:27] to preach it I be a good Christian and
[49:29] and and obey your mother and father and
[49:32] do these kind of things but I believe
[49:34] that as the as the years have gone by
[49:36] more and more light as being shown on
[49:39] the gospel until now we can have a
[49:41] little devotional as what we're talking
[49:42] about we're talking about the five
[49:44] companies of Elijah and what that means
[49:46] we're talking about what is the face of
[49:47] the father's we can talk about what is
[49:49] this difference between son of man and
[49:51] son of God and Son of David and we can
[49:53] have those little discussions with with
[49:54] our children to where they know even
[49:56] even without the baptism of the Holy
[49:58] Ghost at least they're taught right at
[50:00] least they know what the statute of a
[50:02] perfect man is I believe every man woman
[50:04] child in here every parent in here is
[50:08] able program said a mother is a preacher
[50:10] of her home everyone is able to raise
[50:12] their children up in the admonition of
[50:14] the Lord by teaching them the message of
[50:15] this day you know you can you hear just
[50:19] just a little bit maybe it like brother
[50:20] wait sometimes says he says you know
[50:22] when you sit in church you you might
[50:23] only be able to get because of our the
[50:26] limit of our thinking capacity might
[50:29] only be able to get this like 15 minutes
[50:31] but when you go home and and your mom
[50:34] and dad they begin to break that word
[50:35] down to you and sit and have a little
[50:37] devotionals and things and begin to open
[50:39] up that word to you but it'll it'll
[50:41] cause an effect but open up open up the
[50:48] door to your heart and see the what what
[50:50] stymies people what causes people to
[50:52] fail to realize what's happening is that
[50:54] the word is being preached the word is
[50:57] being lived through people through
[51:00] individuals how can it be that the Word
[51:04] of God can be lived in an individual
[51:06] this flesh and blood that's walking
[51:08] around on two feet that there's not like
[51:11] visible pillar of fire over them that
[51:13] the word has preached through men's lips
[51:15] that's what you know I somebody was
[51:18] telling me that the reason they don't
[51:20] come to church is because they just
[51:22] can't get past that idea of it that
[51:24] that's just some man up there some man
[51:26] up there speaking and you know another
[51:28] thing that's hard for people to get by
[51:30] is that that God God can live through
[51:33] the individuals of the congregation that
[51:36] a man sitting in a congregation could be
[51:38] could be God made manifest he could be
[51:42] living out that word and that that just
[51:44] that that see how God is revealing
[51:47] himself in simplicity he reveals that he
[51:50] he hides the simplicity and reveals
[51:52] himself in the same he comes down and
[51:55] veils himself like he did in back behind
[51:57] badger skins and then behind the flesh
[51:59] of a man Christ Jesus and he and he
[52:01] veils himself so that the world can't
[52:03] see it and he's veiling himself behind
[52:05] your a nice skin hey man I'm sorry I
[52:19] gotta get some water let's see we we
[52:27] keep the door closed I think think about
[52:30] the son of man when the Son of Man came
[52:32] the Son of Man revelation came everybody
[52:35] was fine everybody was fine as long as
[52:38] brother Branham preached being born
[52:40] again the Pentecostal experience all of
[52:45] those things but when he just like Jesus
[52:47] when Jesus began to say I and my father
[52:49] are one
[52:50] except you eat the flesh of the Son of
[52:52] Man and drink his blood
[52:53] when he began to talk about I am the
[52:55] resurrection and the life when he began
[52:57] to do all those things they loved him
[52:59] when he talked about breaking the bread
[53:00] and the fishes and all those kind of
[53:01] things but when he began to get into
[53:04] that third pool ministry didn't they
[53:06] begin to have a problem with him and see
[53:08] they couldn't go behind there their veil
[53:10] of tradition they had all these these
[53:13] they couldn't go past the tradition of
[53:16] the of the Wesleyan Church and the
[53:18] Lutheran and they got they they got so
[53:21] stuck on you know this is the way my
[53:24] Church believes it this is the way it's
[53:26] been taught for years and you know you
[53:28] can point fingers at the denominational
[53:30] system and everything but but still I
[53:32] believe that even today that's still our
[53:34] problem is because we you know as you
[53:37] come from glory to glory more like
[53:40] really the message is the same as it was
[53:43] 40 50 years ago but I believe that more
[53:45] light has shone on it and so really the
[53:48] preaching of the gospel when you when
[53:50] you heard preachers preach 4050 years
[53:52] ago it seems like it was almost
[53:55] different in a different vein than it is
[53:58] today because more light has been shown
[54:01] on it and so God has taken us he takes
[54:04] us into a greater unfolding of the word
[54:07] and you got to keep up with it if you
[54:10] can't keep up with the footmen how can
[54:12] you keep up when the horsemen come it
[54:14] just keeps getting faster and faster and
[54:16] you got to get moved beyond your
[54:19] traditions where you're still holding to
[54:22] things that somebody taught 20-30 years
[54:25] ago and you you just can't move past
[54:28] that that that false doctrine that a
[54:31] little bit where it just wasn't quite
[54:33] lined up right and you know you hear a
[54:36] preacher preach something it's something
[54:38] I know it's true in my case it'll stick
[54:40] with you for years and years and it's
[54:42] just hard to shake that but when you can
[54:44] let that thing die get that thing away
[54:47] from you and let the true reveal word it
[54:49] slot into place and I know I know I've
[54:52] used the expression like a Tetris game
[54:54] before because that's really what it is
[54:56] the Word of God like those that little
[54:59] block game if you've never played Tetris
[55:00] it's this little block game and little
[55:02] blocks that have to that you try to
[55:04] slide into place and that's what the
[55:06] Word of God is like this this
[55:07] pyramid-building when you can't even get
[55:10] a Razors Edge between because you've
[55:12] accepted the word for your day and it
[55:14] just moves right into place one word at
[55:16] a time because God is building his body
[55:18] he's molding you into his image and if
[55:21] you won't if you got a little tradition
[55:23] or something in in place that block
[55:26] can't slot right in there it won't move
[55:28] right in there if you believe it's not
[55:31] for you it's not for me
[55:32] it does brother branham really mean that
[55:35] did God really mean that and I had a
[55:39] quote about that well we get questions
[55:42] oh here it is and God's Word calls for a
[55:49] total separation he said the question is
[55:52] to the people today does he really mean
[55:54] it and when you accept what the church
[55:56] says does he really mean it then you put
[55:59] yourself in the same condition that Adam
[56:01] did and join yourself with the woman of
[56:03] the church of this world and separate
[56:05] yourself from the blessings that God has
[56:07] promised to every believer that was
[56:09] separate himself from the word world to
[56:11] the word now that's the truth does he
[56:14] really mean it but when you down in your
[56:16] heart of hearts believe that and accept
[56:19] it for that to be the truth and it'll
[56:21] slot right into place then it'll begin
[56:23] to manifest you in your life and I
[56:25] believe that's why brother Branham
[56:26] preached messages like works his faith
[56:28] expressed you know he preached that
[56:30] after the seals because when you really
[56:32] believe that that it'll begin to it'll
[56:34] begin to manifest in your life it
[56:37] becomes the life of Christ you know
[56:39] brother I preached that sermon doors
[56:41] endure after the seals because that's
[56:44] that you've got to open up the doors of
[56:46] your heart he wants to have total
[56:48] complete preeminence in you total
[56:50] control over you not just relegated off
[56:53] to the side somewhere not just put off
[56:55] but every door in your heart every door
[56:58] in your life completely opened up that
[57:00] God can dwell in you that brother I'm
[57:02] talked about the door of tradition the
[57:04] door of egos and ideas and the door of
[57:08] your private life think about a church
[57:11] where every door is flung open wide
[57:13] where God can move freely all throughout
[57:16] the house of your of your being and have
[57:19] total control of you that's what God
[57:21] wants us to be and faith is the key to
[57:26] get us there I'm gonna go ahead and
[57:28] close a little bit earlier they're gonna
[57:29] meet let's let the musicians come on up
[57:31] and we'll we'll just end right there
[57:35] because I believe that faith is the key
[57:37] and how do you get how do you get faith
[57:40] by hearing of the word faith comes by
[57:44] hearing of the word and so how do you
[57:47] get right
[57:47] faith by believing the word for your day
[57:51] by hearing that capstone revelation of
[57:53] the Son of Man except you eat my flesh
[57:55] and drink my blood you have no life in
[57:58] you except you eat that body were the
[58:01] son of man you don't have any life God
[58:04] has come down to through seven Church
[58:06] ages through that son of God
[58:08] dispensation until he comes to the final
[58:11] till he finally gets ready to reveal
[58:14] himself a son of man and how is he gonna
[58:16] reveal himself as son of man through one
[58:19] man or through the Bride of Christ there
[58:22] standing on the earth today a man don't
[58:26] believe that a man let's stand to our
[58:30] feet let's just give Him praise
[58:41] [Music]
[58:52] you know this message is the lighthouse
[58:55] that showed us which way to go yes let's
