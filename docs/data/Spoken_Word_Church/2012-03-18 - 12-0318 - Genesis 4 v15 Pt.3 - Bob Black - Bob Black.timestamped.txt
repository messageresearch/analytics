[0:00] okay fine all right last time let's turn
[0:09] back to Genesis for this is what we're
[0:11] really early still you know I love this
[0:24] no you're not listening to my services
[0:48] of the Bears are you sure why I ought to
[0:51] be quiet yeah this is for over 15 year
[0:59] we're reading from and we've been
[1:01] studying on this and the Lord said unto
[1:03] Him therefore news for every slave King
[1:05] vision shall be taking on him Sevenfold
[1:07] and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest
[1:10] any finding him should kill him so we've
[1:13] been looking at the mark and what the
[1:15] Sevenfold punishment means it compares a
[1:17] Sevenfold punishment to down through the
[1:21] Old Testament how God executed a law and
[1:25] justice and then we're bringing it all
[1:27] up to the time of Christ so last time I
[1:30] was just going through the history the
[1:33] violence of the Old Testament how after
[1:34] the flood god instituted civil justice
[1:37] and then after visualize rejected grace
[1:43] in Exodus 19 then God put in gave them a
[1:47] law that if you um if you break the law
[1:50] then you're guilty of the punishment is
[1:53] capital punishment and and then bring it
[1:58] all up let's see where we stopped so
[2:01] last time I kind of review some of the
[2:04] reasons why
[2:07] capital punishment would be implemented
[2:14] against you some of the crimes again let
[2:18] me just run through so that again just
[2:20] just to the background sacrificing any
[2:23] God other than Jehovah passing children
[2:26] to the fire to my life pushing available
[2:28] false prophecy necromancy blasphemy
[2:32] Sabbath breeding savagely breaking an
[2:34] outsider who gets too close to the
[2:36] tabernacle because the the Levites will
[2:38] position between the inner court and the
[2:42] and the outer coordinator court to keep
[2:46] an unbeliever from entering in to the
[2:51] torture sexual immorality adultery
[2:56] married your wife and mother
[2:57] prostitution homosexuality vaishali and
[3:01] murder smiting a parent cursing
[3:03] appearing disobedient children 54
[3:06] child's disobedient and the parents were
[3:08] supposed to stone them kidnapping
[3:11] enables your home side for example if
[3:14] you if you didn't have your ox pinned up
[3:16] and it killed someone that you were
[3:18] guilty and she could be condemned to
[3:21] death contempt of course fault witness
[3:23] to a capital crime and see all these
[3:26] things under the law the Justice had to
[3:29] be applied and there was no to think
[3:33] about this when we get into it under
[3:35] grace about how nowadays you've got
[3:38] prison ministries and things that we're
[3:40] because grace is applied grace allows
[3:44] people that have committed murders all
[3:46] of these things we're reading through
[3:47] gives them an opportunity to accept
[3:49] grace coming to the blood so Alyssa the
[3:54] next the next thing is we're just going
[3:56] through the history of violence in the
[3:58] Old Testament and coming up to grace
[4:00] let's look at numbers 35
[4:14] now I'm kind of doing a little highly
[4:17] water because we're all familiar with a
[4:20] lot of these topics this is the cities
[4:24] of refuge that the bleach verse 6 and 7
[4:27] and among the cities which he shall give
[4:30] unto the Levites there shall be six
[4:32] cities for refuge which he lost his shop
[4:33] point for the Mansa langer that he may
[4:35] flee thither until then you shall have
[4:37] forty and two cities so all the cities
[4:40] we shall give to the Levites shall be 40
[4:42] MHC me to them show you give with their
[4:44] suburbs so what happens if someone
[4:47] unintentionally murdered someone then
[4:50] they could flee to the city and then be
[4:52] judged because every everyone has to
[4:54] stand before the judgment and then if
[4:57] you were found to not intentionally have
[5:00] murdered someone then you can take
[5:02] refuge in the city which is a type of
[5:04] taking refuge in Christ and you would
[5:08] you would have to stay in that city
[5:10] until unless you want to risk your life
[5:12] of being killed by the one of the
[5:14] Avengers a lot of family members for
[5:16] example of the person that you
[5:17] accidentally killed and you stay in that
[5:19] city until the high priest died and the
[5:23] you know Jesus is a high priest of our
[5:25] confession when he died were set free Oh
[5:33] vengeance we were talking last time
[5:35] about vengeance with Cain how God always
[5:39] through the Old Testament he opposed own
[5:41] vengeance let's look at Leviticus 19 see
[5:45] how much deal even though justice has
[5:48] been implemented in the law
[5:53] you still can't take these listen to
[5:55] someone
[6:03] Thanks Leviticus 19 18
[6:14] chapter 19 verse 18 let's just let's
[6:21] start at verse 17 thou shalt not hate
[6:24] thy brother in the heart thou shalt in
[6:26] any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not
[6:28] suffer sin upon verse 18 thou shalt not
[6:31] Abby engine or very any grudge against
[6:33] the children's I can so thou shalt love
[6:35] thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord
[6:38] and it's interesting how they Old
[6:42] Testament and I'm gonna talk about this
[6:43] in a second how the Old Testament bills
[6:46] because they be the profits from
[6:47] building the body of Christ the body of
[6:49] the church by establishing the word that
[6:52] build upon it one thing builds upon
[6:55] another and a whole everything just
[6:56] builds precept upon precept but even in
[6:59] the Old Testament you can see how
[7:00] vengeance is the law of God that that
[7:04] Jesus preached about he was on earth was
[7:06] already being established in the Old
[7:08] Testament and even though law and
[7:11] justice is in play it's still not right
[7:15] to take vengeance on some 10 proverbs 24
[7:22] 29 to 30
[7:26] proverbs 24
[7:35] first 29
[7:44] mr. Street verse 29 see not I will do so
[7:48] for him as he have done to me young will
[7:50] render to the man according to his work
[7:57] now we know that this is going to be a
[8:03] very quick heavy less because I have a
[8:05] lot of quotes that Roberto said we know
[8:09] that a Elijah you know even when the 50
[8:13] came let's go ahead and read escort the
[8:16] second king is first one Moses
[8:25] represented along Elijah represented
[8:27] justice second Kings chapter 1 verse 9
[8:36] to 13 this is the story of how they are
[8:45] the armies were sent to bring Elijah and
[8:51] God through well I just smoked the
[8:56] fifties he said three in the third was
[9:00] was favored because they're offended
[9:02] then the king sent under him a captain
[9:04] of 50 with his 50 and he went up to him
[9:06] and behold he said on the top of a hill
[9:08] and he spake unto him thou a man of God
[9:10] the king of said come down when Elijah
[9:13] answered and said to the captain or 50
[9:15] if I be a man of God then let fire come
[9:17] down from heaven to consume the end I 50
[9:19] and there came down fire from heaven
[9:20] consumed him in this 50 again also he
[9:23] sent unto him another capital of 50 with
[9:25] his 50 any answer who said on here
[9:26] momentum god that's not the king said
[9:28] come down quickly and a large answer to
[9:31] Senator than five be
[9:32] man oh God let fire come down from
[9:33] heaven and consume D&I 50 and the fire
[9:36] of God came down from heaven and
[9:37] consumed him of his beauty and he sent
[9:40] again a captain of the third 50 with his
[9:42] 50 and the third capita 50 went up and
[9:44] came and fell on his knees before lives
[9:46] and assaulted 27 to him oh man oh god I
[9:49] preview let my life and the life of
[9:51] these 50 die surface tension be precious
[9:53] in that site and then my straightener
[10:12] then we come up to what Ramos's in a
[10:15] life and and Jesus were all on my formal
[10:20] the Mount of Transfiguration and brother
[10:25] Brendan said they left represented law
[10:26] justice in grace when Jesus came Gracie
[10:29] it's to degrade slowly see buddies in
[10:32] the absolute you said the very God that
[10:36] could take a little nosed you like all
[10:38] angry and going down there to put all
[10:40] the Christians to death under capital
[10:41] punishment will change him and making my
[10:43] lovely chrétien that same tires tonight
[10:46] can change law to grace any time that he
[10:48] takes a nation to do it now um the Old
[10:54] Testament story we talked about which
[10:56] one we just went over was a dispensation
[11:00] of period work otters were revealing
[11:03] himself in a different way than he is
[11:05] now or relating himself to me in a
[11:08] different way and just to talk about
[11:10] dispensationalism a little bit
[11:12] dispensational your non
[11:15] dispensationalist you started the New
[11:17] Testament and you look at the new
[11:18] testament to see what the Old Testament
[11:20] see it but dispensational has started
[11:22] the Old Testament
[11:23] beginning to the hand and everything
[11:25] builds on these on until the precept
[11:27] upon precept so you start from Cain and
[11:30] you kind of you begin to understand
[11:33] God's motives and objectives and his
[11:35] character you look at the Old Testament
[11:37] see how the the law on that justice is a
[11:40] tight a natural type of in a new
[11:42] testament of spiritual so in the Old
[11:45] Testament they would take a sword up and
[11:47] kill run somebody through if they if
[11:50] they broke a law in the New Testament
[11:52] it's a new testament is spiritual death
[11:58] there's some spiritual death on the Old
[11:59] Testament spiritual death on New
[12:00] Testament to but in an act in the Old
[12:02] Testament we have a natural example that
[12:05] we can learn from and that's what
[12:08] dispensationalism is going from the
[12:11] building up on each other through this
[12:13] scripture and I I many people say it's
[12:19] not really a good idea to read the Bible
[12:22] from cover occur but I think at least
[12:23] once in your life you should start the
[12:25] beginning and read through because
[12:26] they're to just see it helps to learn
[12:28] how everything builds on each other Oh
[12:32] another another thing that
[12:36] dispensationalism has in common with
[12:39] what we believe is that the seishin
[12:41] ilysm it has a literal interpretation of
[12:43] Scripture if when you read about the
[12:46] literal curses that are spoken of Israel
[12:50] you can also trust that the blessings
[12:53] that are given to Israel are going to be
[12:55] given to them one
[12:57] we believe that Noah literally was in
[13:01] our that the things that happened in the
[13:09] wilderness literally happened to the
[13:11] children vision so i was telling brother
[13:15] Wade last time that I hope that last
[13:17] last time I kind of was talking about
[13:20] the Old Testament law and justice and I
[13:23] hope I didn't give me the impression
[13:24] that in the New Testament that we still
[13:27] have capital punishment and we'll get in
[13:32] what brother branham's said in a second
[13:33] because the the crux of the matter is
[13:38] what are we interested in are we
[13:39] interested in death or life and now
[13:41] we're interested in life nincada smyrna
[13:48] brother and said now the Old Testament
[13:50] and all of his characters and
[13:51] characteristics was only a foreshadow of
[13:53] the wage of the Keystone a new testament
[13:56] that joins law and this dispensation to
[13:59] healing many people has referred to this
[14:01] as the Christian dispensation but it
[14:04] isn't this is the Holy Spirit
[14:06] dispensation the Christian dispensation
[14:08] lasted three years of six months the law
[14:11] lasted for several hundred years and
[14:13] then the Christian dispensation was what
[14:15] Brie's dorky stoned and you an old
[14:17] testament together now at the New
[14:20] Testament just to explain what the New
[14:22] Testament is the New Covenant is the New
[14:24] Testament in his blood the life that was
[14:27] in his blood coming back on you and
[14:29] living in that's what the new testimony
[14:39] here you heal he said what did Elijah
[14:42] represent the Justice of God who wants
[14:45] justice brother I don't want mercy not
[14:47] justice we're all born in seeing safe
[14:49] genetically and then come to the world
[14:53] speaking lies we are guilty from the
[14:56] beginning to the end there's not one of
[14:57] us can redeem one another if we're
[14:59] Archbishop's hoops whatever we might be
[15:02] your profits or whatever even if we were
[15:05] angels we would still be unfit to redeem
[15:07] one another certainly I don't want
[15:09] justice never do I call for justice I
[15:11] want mercy God give me your mercy now
[15:16] when we think about what Jesus let me
[15:18] explain what desus did on the cross a
[15:20] lot of people I remember years ago we
[15:25] met this little sister that being worn
[15:27] to a message church for her whole life
[15:29] and she she meant comment that she had
[15:31] just seen what Jesus did on the cross
[15:34] and
[15:43] I'm just to give an example with if
[15:46] let's say if I was a judge and someone
[15:49] came up to me or someone was being tried
[15:51] then as a human judge I might just take
[15:56] the what they had done in the list of
[15:59] their sins and just kind of throw it in
[16:01] the trash can and saying well because of
[16:03] my my human compassion to you I'm going
[16:06] to take what you've done and just throw
[16:08] it away and according to our human laws
[16:11] that might work that might everything
[16:14] might be all right but God is a God
[16:16] justice and that's not just because if
[16:18] you even if you throw it away that your
[16:20] sins are still in the landfill or
[16:22] whatever the mark of the the record of
[16:24] what you've done is still there when he
[16:26] came all across what he did was he a man
[16:41] he took everything that we did yep I'm
[16:46] sorry okay take it upon himself so
[16:52] there's no record do you more
[17:02] the message look he said he was talking
[17:06] about i said well i was calling the case
[17:08] the other day you know he's over here in
[17:11] Texas I got a little certificate from
[17:13] him the other day saving a life and said
[17:15] we went over there for that little acres
[17:17] that may not taken a picture of the
[17:19] angel of the Lord in that night over
[17:20] there Houston they criticize me and said
[17:22] everything in the world about me threw
[17:25] his arms around me hug me said just
[17:26] think brother Brennan the very man that
[17:28] I said was practicing hypnosis has come
[17:31] to save my son from the electric chair
[17:33] that's right I talk there before them
[17:37] all on what did the governor do pardon
[17:39] oh my oh and it was to die in 45 days
[17:42] after was right while interested in life
[17:45] life I said sir you have no right to
[17:49] take the boy's life the first blood was
[17:52] ever spilled one brothers build another
[17:54] he shed his blood I didn't take his life
[17:57] in capital punishment he put a mark upon
[17:59] him that nobody would kill him don't rub
[18:01] that off a man named me and right we're
[18:03] interested in life now I need to make
[18:06] this point if you look at what all of
[18:08] the other denominations believe all the
[18:10] other theologians if you look at what aw
[18:12] pink candy Toby bullinger and all the
[18:14] famous writers say everybody says the
[18:17] capital punishment is still in effect
[18:19] but brother branham differs then he's
[18:23] the only one if I did a lot of reading
[18:26] on what people think and you can't find
[18:28] anybody that could tie like together
[18:31] like brother n appear in your tail 60 he
[18:35] said they killed him because he made
[18:37] himself God he was godly hung him
[18:39] because he died on her capital
[18:40] punishment that's the reason I don't
[18:42] believe in capital punishment Jesus died
[18:44] under the punishment of capital
[18:47] punishment from the
[18:48] government of crying because God willing
[18:51] we'll take capital punishment as a
[18:52] nation and he'll use it against God's
[18:54] people like he's doing brother Yusuf
[18:56] over there and Irene we keep it in your
[18:58] prayer and you can see how God's
[19:00] fighting a battle for him all the
[19:02] nations of the world are coming together
[19:03] brother you said who should have been
[19:07] dead already Irena anything to do with
[19:10] it is your life really other gospel he
[19:15] said I don't believe in taking the
[19:16] people's life he said if you'll notice
[19:18] on your criminal records records who is
[19:20] it that gets cute little electric chairs
[19:22] and things it's not the rich you can
[19:24] afford to get him a lawyer and some pool
[19:26] some dirty tricks and some wheels here
[19:28] and some over here and drive the thing
[19:29] he said its own kids like that they
[19:31] found enough money to buy them a decent
[19:33] meal that's the kind of gifts there's
[19:36] the kind of the electrocute somebody
[19:37] that's like they call a bunch of
[19:39] ignorant when they just hold up their
[19:40] lane or capital punishment I said the
[19:43] first murder was ever committed in the
[19:44] world one brother kill another and God
[19:46] and not taking his life for it he put a
[19:48] marker woman that nobody she take he's a
[19:50] lot right that's the supreme judge i see
[19:53] they took the sent us off with him now
[19:54] they're going to get another truck or
[19:56] still get life now somebody 11 years or
[19:58] maybe stand for all their guilty
[19:59] certainly they're guilty he's not saying
[20:03] they're not guilty they're guilty but
[20:05] they shouldn't get get the death penalty
[20:07] they ought to be set to penitentiary for
[20:09] a lifetime but not their life taken ooh
[20:10] no man has a right to take another man's
[20:13] life no sir I don't believe in at No
[20:15] Andy because we're back just like in the
[20:18] original justice was in God's hands now
[20:21] it's back in his hands again in the
[20:24] bride and uh
[20:27] we stopped a second reef
[20:34] let's look at my ng5
[21:24] let's start at verse 17
[21:32] think not that I am come to destroy the
[21:35] law or the prophets I'm not come to
[21:37] destroy but to fulfill and I I don't
[21:40] know about you but sometimes I kind of
[21:41] Miss quote this in my head as I'm not
[21:43] going to destroy but to magnify but here
[21:47] he says I'm come to fulfill to what I
[21:49] was talking about he took everything
[21:50] although all of the sin in our lives on
[21:53] himself and fulfilled it once because he
[21:56] died now we can live because he took all
[22:00] all of the accusations against us and
[22:04] took it upon himself and so where does
[22:09] it say he's going to magnify the law
[22:12] because we know it says that I said
[22:13] Isaiah and don't don't turn their less
[22:15] Isaiah 42 the Lord is well pleased for
[22:18] his righteous to say people magnify the
[22:20] law and make it honorable and then he
[22:24] proceeds to make a follow all this it
[22:26] makes it greater makes it i'm fairly i
[22:31] say to you till heaven earth pass one
[22:33] jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass
[22:35] from the law till all be fulfilled
[22:38] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[22:41] these least Commandments I shall teach
[22:42] men so he shall be called the least in
[22:44] the kingdom of heaven but whosoever
[22:46] shall teaching you and teach them the
[22:48] same shall be called great in the
[22:50] kingdom of doing for I saying the unit
[22:53] except your righteousness shall exceed
[22:54] the righteousness of the scribes and
[22:56] Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[22:58] into the kingdom of heaven he of heard
[23:01] that it was said by them of old time
[23:02] thou shalt not kill whosoever shall kill
[23:05] shall be amazed
[23:06] the judgment now is magnifying the hall
[23:10] from the old times somebody put witness
[23:13] you killing somebody and say well this
[23:14] person struck them with a sword smote
[23:17] them down but now how are you going to
[23:20] tell if somebody has violated the law
[23:23] but I say unto you that whosoever is
[23:25] angry with his brother without a cause
[23:27] shall be in danger of the judgment Zeus
[23:30] whoever shall say to his brother raca
[23:32] which is kind of like it was a it means
[23:36] um it was expression that you back then
[23:39] to call somebody stupid or say there's
[23:42] there's another AP here that's what it
[23:44] really means it in TN that person is
[23:47] empty-headed shall be in danger of the
[23:49] council but whosoever shall say that
[23:51] fool and in Psalms David said the fool
[23:55] say that a corner is no God what this
[23:57] really means is a rebel now fool that
[24:00] were biggest person is repelling is God
[24:02] shall be in danger of Hell fire so don't
[24:05] don't call your brother tell your
[24:07] brother sister say they're not a
[24:08] believer accused you accuse somebody not
[24:14] be a Christian in bed with your heart
[24:16] this but my point is in the Old
[24:22] Testament it was apparent to everyone if
[24:24] somebody committed a crime and now it'll
[24:25] always magnified the Holy Spirit has to
[24:28] accuse you in your heart it's not uh
[24:31] it's between you and God there's no way
[24:34] for me to say well brother Danny oh you
[24:36] know doesn't like me or so let's let's
[24:39] take him out and give it a capital
[24:41] punishment and I years a few years ago
[24:44] but I think the thought Harris was
[24:45] telling me about another mr. Church that
[24:47] if you disagree with what I teach them
[24:49] the Deaconess will take you outside and
[24:50] give you a big what there
[24:54] so there are some people that kind of
[24:56] take the capital punishment thing a
[24:57] little bit literally oh that's a
[25:00] yes physically oh the best most is that
[25:14] justice no sir no justice I thought very
[25:17] bad about it when I looked over in the
[25:19] Bible and seeing that every man that
[25:20] ever have a spiritual office in the
[25:22] Bible was connected with the government
[25:23] the government God can call this the
[25:25] seat of the devil think back Moses dear
[25:28] Ryan Daniel all the toughest even Jesus
[25:30] Christ died under capital punishment by
[25:33] the government they can't catch them in
[25:35] morals and anything else of the devil is
[25:37] amazed he throws it all the government
[25:39] that's exactly right yeah and I don't
[25:41] have any political motive for discussion
[25:44] capital punishment because I I'm the
[25:46] last person you want to ask about
[25:48] political opinions but no we're just
[25:51] talking about the Bible here Christ has
[25:54] revealed in his own word brother Brown
[25:57] said so was the priest releases to the
[25:59] core some religious 21 misconstrued they
[26:02] be stoned to death the death penalty of
[26:03] fooling with the word of God was dead
[26:06] that's what's the matter with our
[26:08] country today the really got so many
[26:09] loose leaf things in the earth today the
[26:11] penalties are not strong enough if a man
[26:14] was caught running out with another
[26:16] man's wife they should be both be taken
[26:18] out and put it in cash trader right
[26:19] public and turn loose that's right a man
[26:21] is caught him doing anything wrong down
[26:22] the road speeding he ought to be given
[26:24] less than 10 years he's premeditated
[26:27] murder I strongly
[26:30] and premeditated murder if you call
[26:33] speed to see you put penalties like that
[26:36] on it you'll slow them down but when
[26:38] some crooked politician can get to this
[26:40] one over here passing off and say well
[26:42] he was a drinking little he was getting
[26:44] me to do that kill a man wife and a
[26:46] whole bunch of innocent children letting
[26:47] Ricky get by with it max politics that's
[26:50] the word or less than devil now that
[26:55] Christ is revealing his own words and
[26:57] God said if a man was caught in adultery
[26:59] or a woman take them out there and stone
[27:01] him to death that settled it see if he's
[27:03] even caught picking up a weight of stick
[27:05] on the South they take him and stony you
[27:07] know that used today they even have
[27:09] prohibition on the side on their saddle
[27:11] too they won't even push the elevator
[27:13] button or anything because if you push
[27:16] that low belly button you're doing
[27:17] you're doing work babe they live
[27:18] complete divided along they said they
[27:21] lived it by then and now see we don't
[27:23] have them kind of laws today but the
[27:26] Christian the church what I'm talking to
[27:30] this morning that law of God is in your
[27:32] heart see you have no desire to do it
[27:36] it's inside here you want to keep God's
[27:38] law so perfect no matter what it is you
[27:41] want to be just what if God needs a
[27:43] doorman at the door he wants you to be
[27:45] that door mat you're so happy to be
[27:46] there no matter what it would be you
[27:48] won't be the doormat see whatever God
[27:50] wants you to do that's what you want to
[27:51] do because it's God the law of God is in
[27:55] your heart
[28:05] Christ as a mixture of God our ability
[28:07] said Christ have mercy the law puts you
[28:09] in jail but couldn't get you out the
[28:11] Prophet says God's just to continue and
[28:13] kill you for that's right but Jesus was
[28:15] God to love in revelation to let note
[28:18] refer destined to see that he had
[28:20] ecology their blasphemous names like
[28:23] from his name z said motors representing
[28:25] the law the prophets represented his
[28:26] justice we could not live by the law we
[28:29] cannot live by his justice I don't ask
[28:31] just to someone mercy not justice I
[28:33] can't keep his law when I can't keep his
[28:35] me to justice but I need his mercy and
[28:37] God said the law and justice has been
[28:40] met in him he's my beloved son him
[28:42] that's him that's the one so we won't be
[28:46] in Christ but for those that are even
[28:49] not in Christ you still want to give
[28:51] them life you want to give them a chance
[28:53] to repeat because of that I I was just
[28:57] thinking about when I was studying on
[28:58] this all the all the people that all the
[29:01] prison ministries and different things
[29:03] that I I heard a years ago about this
[29:08] brother over in Africa that had killed I
[29:10] forget how many different people than he
[29:12] heard about the message and be called
[29:14] God's grace he's now one of the he's an
[29:18] apostle I know they're taking the word
[29:19] to jungles and things even though in
[29:21] this in his life he had you know that
[29:24] against his record killed six or seven
[29:26] different me and was into witchcraft and
[29:29] all kinds of different things but never
[29:30] to God's grace and saved it what about
[29:34] the prophets what about Elijah and what
[29:36] did he mean he was just a super
[29:37] presented God's justice a no man can be
[29:39] just outside of Christ Elijah had a
[29:42] commandment from God he went to the top
[29:43] of the mountain and while he was up
[29:45] there the king said let's go up and get
[29:46] that old crank at all
[29:47] go up and get him and he sent 50 min and
[29:50] that will profit stood a little old ski
[29:54] body and whiskers hanging down like a
[29:55] fuzzy were me he said if I be a man of
[29:57] God that fire fall from heaven and
[29:59] consume me that's justice that's what
[30:02] you deserve I don't want what I deserve
[30:04] I don't want just to say don't want
[30:07] judgment I want mercy God gave me mercy
[30:09] and others of all I'm not a denomination
[30:11] not as bishops I wanted to love and His
[30:14] mercy that's what the world is hungry
[30:15] for today is his loving his mercy God's
[30:17] mercy upon us I couldn't stand as with
[30:20] all I can't keep his law and he knows i
[30:22] don't want his justice he would condemn
[30:24] me but I'll accepted mercy and what can
[30:28] Jesus do for you you can save you can
[30:31] heal you you can give you a Salvation it
[30:33] can take you to go or you can cover your
[30:34] sins you can make your love one another
[30:36] you can make the method that shake hands
[30:38] with the Baptist and the Baptist and the
[30:39] presbytery of their arms around
[30:41] penticoff maybe brush
[30:48] stuff few more minutes and the message
[30:51] look brother Brennan said one day a
[30:53] mother boy acutely and he was laying
[30:55] there ready to die and so the little
[30:57] mother stood by the governor's go when
[30:59] they asked him and finally with one of
[31:02] the guard said governor that boys I he
[31:04] wants you she wants to see you and when
[31:06] they open the door and said madam he
[31:08] will receive you that little the poor
[31:10] little thing crawled on her hands and
[31:11] knees after speed ladies hands her hands
[31:14] upon his feet and said governor
[31:16] honorable sir said you're the only man
[31:19] it slip they can spare my son please
[31:21] counselor I know he's guilty he's just
[31:24] as guilty your course of justice
[31:25] founding guilty and how many of us are
[31:27] not guilty in the courts of God your
[31:30] course of justice found him guilty he
[31:32] actually killed and he's subject to
[31:33] death I knew that but sure is a man you
[31:36] have no right to take the life of my boy
[31:38] god only can give life and only God can
[31:41] take life so just to finish God's given
[31:45] us mercy in this dispensation and if you
[31:47] turn that down you you're going to go to
[31:50] spiritual take own spiritual death it's
[31:54] my little horrible thing burn down such
[31:56] grace God is we you can see how God's go
[32:02] from a dispensation of law and justice
[32:05] which is what we deserve and I can give
[32:07] us grace and we should do everything you
[32:12] can to accept it and give our lives to
[32:16] it
