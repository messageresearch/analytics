[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] all right okay now we're in the book of
[0:04] Romans I know y'all work well it's
[0:13] brother Stan Stan no smelly anyway
[0:25] alright here we go
[0:27] now we're in chapter two of the book
[0:29] Roman and I'm just leaning all kind of
[0:33] good stuff out of this going one by one
[0:35] so I hope you guys are too and it's
[0:39] fitting right along with the steals I
[0:41] think the whole Bible that's the seal
[0:45] that are locked up until God opened on
[0:49] to the prophet in 63 and now 50
[0:52] something years later I believe he's
[0:54] opening them up to us as individuals we
[1:00] are we have the we have the right player
[1:05] the team we've got everything right here
[1:07] - there's nothing else coming
[1:10] I believe 144,000 are growing up over
[1:14] there and getting of age where they can
[1:17] understand the document when it comes to
[1:19] them and it's just an exciting time that
[1:21] we know now because remember even even
[1:25] in 63 and all that what brother ever
[1:27] said you're not getting it no words
[1:29] until we did another quote around the
[1:31] coming of the Lord these things would be
[1:33] made known I believe in sentence seven
[1:34] seals and now coming in the Lord has
[1:39] been happening we know since the day of
[1:41] Pentecost that's just coming back in the
[1:45] people sense that they've been caught
[1:47] not finish off 1906 I'm gonna back off a
[1:50] t30 okay back then and then you say well
[1:55] that the coming of the Lord
[1:57] then is to the
[1:58] it's work and it is because words been
[2:00] revealed all the way down through but
[2:02] this is the culmination this is what
[2:03] everything's been done this is when you
[2:07] are not talking to Paul talking to a
[2:08] bunch of Romans that he's fixing to go
[2:10] see and he's talking to them God's
[2:13] talking through them to them but God's
[2:16] talking through him to me and you okay
[2:20] so it's not the Romans that he's talking
[2:22] to now it's me and you is talking today
[2:23] and then we can all look back we've got
[2:26] all this equipment I was thinking the
[2:28] other day you know we got all this to
[2:31] our disposal we just shouldn't be any
[2:35] questions I don't know what the message
[2:37] is about truly it's not hair and dress
[2:41] it's not living a good Christian life
[2:44] they did that before the message got
[2:46] here right now so it's not all that but
[2:51] that is included but still there's an
[2:59] element like we were saying not long ago
[3:01] there's a supernatural element and even
[3:04] brother Branham I read it this afternoon
[3:05] where we're going to I want everybody to
[3:08] get real long enough and Greaves that
[3:10] for this afternoon we'll talk about
[3:12] marriage and forth okay we are gonna
[3:14] talk about but we got a look at in the
[3:19] spiritual sense because in the natural
[3:22] sense you have different grace there's
[3:26] no grace there's no grace in marriage
[3:28] before time if you had the world but
[3:33] under the grace that was given then the
[3:37] prophet of God said because of a
[3:39] supernatural revelation of the open the
[3:41] sealed now I see like I said Cindy I see
[3:45] where he got the revelation I believe
[3:46] which is then the third seal that were
[3:48] in now but now that didn't totally
[3:50] finish it because he
[3:51] the fifth seal and open up that fifth
[3:54] seal now he God opened up that fifth
[3:56] seal to the Prophet showing him there's
[3:58] a group of people that did all these
[4:00] dirty things but you know was grace
[4:03] giving an eternal life since he went to
[4:05] that group of people so there for me is
[4:07] the grace of marriage in divorce because
[4:09] listen the grace of magazine divorce
[4:14] extends to what we do in the flesh you
[4:19] mean it extends to what we do in flesh
[4:21] because if not then a sister animal is
[4:25] saying a few minutes ago
[4:26] once we realized that the new person
[4:28] will a couple by this afternoon because
[4:29] there was some questions during this
[4:31] week from from people that I want to
[4:33] clarify all the new birth I'm glad they
[4:35] liked the cover because we talked about
[4:36] he might cover this morning I won't
[4:37] cover the second or two that burnt that
[4:40] that I'll make sure that Souls dead
[4:42] gotta be dead there's your dirty
[4:44] marriage and divorce listen if your
[4:45] husband dies if I were to pass away
[4:48] James free to marry only in the Lord but
[4:51] she doesn't have to look back and worry
[4:53] about a marriage in divorce situation
[4:55] right now I'm coming onto this right
[4:57] here because I'm talking about
[4:58] circumcision in just a few minutes and
[5:00] that all kind of in together but see if
[5:03] you do have a living husband then you
[5:04] got to find some kind of grace because
[5:06] in the Bible you can't have it right
[5:09] it's unlawful and you mark all of you
[5:13] have a name calling a dolphin but then
[5:20] you got all these other different
[5:21] situations so Lexi what I really going
[5:23] getting imagine horse but we are going
[5:24] to cover because God had to divorce
[5:26] Israel to manage the Gentiles because
[5:30] they come under circumcision fleshling
[5:33] you understand I'm saying we're all
[5:34] adults here in the New Testament if you
[5:37] walked up to a guy and he says well
[5:40] where are you from
[5:41] well I'm here alive show me well do you
[5:45] take you behind Andy show you the
[5:48] understand because Gentiles
[5:49] circumcised right hand
[5:51] truly uncircumcised in their flesh but
[5:55] see that's a tight claim wave of
[5:57] marriage and divorce it's the type of
[5:59] Christ in the church Christ can't be
[6:01] married to two three people at the time
[6:03] that's why the Gentile bride we'll talk
[6:06] about this afternoon the new birth is
[6:09] the only thing that takes away your man
[6:11] in the war situation then say in your
[6:12] soul in your soul okay because the rest
[6:19] is just giving eternal life it's
[6:20] watching on judgment and all these other
[6:21] things impartation of eternal life not
[6:25] the very thing because the very god of
[6:30] heavens got to come in and burn that old
[6:31] nature kill that old nature and then he
[6:33] marries you but you've still got that
[6:35] spirit realm thank God I can't see her
[6:46] person when Ron starts sleep and he'll
[6:48] not off naturally because when I look at
[7:01] her I don't like you
[7:04] and anyway I do I do think of her hidden
[7:08] respect of being married to you and
[7:10] having to put up with all that Bailey um
[7:13] here we go and the horse thing you know
[7:15] me but now remember to though the things
[7:19] we do in our body had to be covered if I
[7:22] understand that they look things man we
[7:24] did it our body had to be covered
[7:26] because of misinterpreted theology so it
[7:31] was a I said wasn't man's fault but it
[7:35] was man's fault but it wasn't the
[7:38] general population it was what they were
[7:40] taught listen we grow up into what we're
[7:42] talking now usually about what you're
[7:45] being taught right okay so they live by
[7:49] what they were called which was ok to
[7:50] the divorce and okay commands you can't
[7:52] live well you know get rid of them and
[7:54] get you know fines you wanted to live
[7:56] with no that's not what I said that's
[7:59] not what I said right it's not didn't
[8:01] say that
[8:02] okay so in that same way with him I
[8:05] don't want listen a final minute to
[8:07] Christ I don't want him playing around
[8:08] with no other woman no other bride he's
[8:14] mine he's hot
[8:16] and when we realize that say we'll
[8:18] realize what we have what's this
[8:20] relation say when we realize truly what
[8:23] we got already inside of us not coming
[8:26] here already then we realized that a lot
[8:29] of these things that were worried about
[8:32] to me takes all the worry away to me the
[8:35] opening of the same seal takes a lot of
[8:37] worry away from anything that I've
[8:38] thought before about myself or
[8:42] previously thought about what's going on
[8:44] what's going to happen it's just really
[8:46] settled everything
[8:48] the opening of the seal should do to you
[8:49] it should several things we should not
[8:52] be tossed about we're getting the wrong
[8:55] as they were talks bill because what
[8:57] he's talking to the Jews but he knows
[8:59] he's fishing to talk to the Romans
[9:01] because they're Gentile they're
[9:03] uncircumcised they lived under
[9:05] uncircumcision you know but that was a
[9:10] time that was a time look what the old
[9:13] flesh being put away but when we get on
[9:18] further we're going to look at when the
[9:20] unclean spirit goes down the lamb
[9:21] where'd they go Alan if you're not born
[9:24] again it goes down to your soul so there
[9:26] was an unclean spirit in your soul and
[9:28] it was called you and the very nature
[9:33] you are I mean you know say the tax to
[9:35] sell to you because of what you come
[9:37] wrong you were born wrong that's why you
[9:40] needed a new birth right and I'll get to
[9:45] it this afternoon because some have
[9:47] formulated in their mind even in the
[9:51] church that you can receive the new
[9:53] birth after you're dead
[9:55] I think never go have a never will
[9:59] happen like that but it's a question in
[10:06] people's mind is the question in
[10:08] people's mind and you got an answer and
[10:09] and people and people thought ooh can't
[10:13] be listen when you talk about the new
[10:15] birth it is something totally different
[10:17] than you turn alive but yet it is
[10:22] eternal
[10:23] but there's an impartation of eternal
[10:26] life there's what the Old Testament died
[10:28] there's what the fifth sealed you got
[10:30] there's worked up foolish virgin gift
[10:33] and there's 144,000 gift that has
[10:35] nothing to do with anybody not one thing
[10:38] nothing I will get them self this
[10:42] afternoon that's why I told then that
[10:43] third seal showed me that there if
[10:48] there's not a dad then you're alive
[10:52] while you're dead and that's the inside
[10:54] person you're alive
[10:55] walking a lot of me a lot but you're
[10:58] dead inside if you don't have the new
[11:00] birth then you still got the old you
[11:02] living inside there's no way God can
[11:04] marry you there's no way God can be your
[11:06] husband and you can't have an intimate
[11:08] relationship with him father have learn
[11:11] a lord lord have we not watch spoken
[11:14] comes cast out Devils and he said depart
[11:16] from me I never knew look that word new
[11:18] is the same word it says Adam knew his
[11:21] wife that word new is a sexual
[11:23] relationship between a man and a woman
[11:25] basically that's what it is Adam knew
[11:28] his wife and no didn't he just walked up
[11:30] to and say hey I know you
[11:31] that's nobody now he knew her in a
[11:35] sexual way now God doesn't know it's in
[11:39] a sexual way but we still have to have a
[11:41] read invisible union again and read it
[11:44] with a little more understand you read a
[11:47] visibly Union now and you'll see exactly
[11:49] why that it is an invisible union
[11:52] nobody's gonna know abut you and gone
[11:53] but you can't have anything alive in you
[11:56] if you do then Christ in later on when I
[11:59] read the scripture like Sunday that's
[12:00] right if we be dead we'd be dead
[12:03] we're dead then weird ever saying but
[12:06] what alive to Christ was he comes and
[12:09] kills that all nature with what Holy
[12:10] Ghost and fire killed that old nature
[12:13] now that will make her stay it like you
[12:15] thank you for that o negs is dead now
[12:18] that has nothing to do with a spiritual
[12:20] man now he's motivated more by what's
[12:23] inside
[12:25] because we we need the illness of the
[12:27] world
[12:28] because the one inside of us was the
[12:29] motivating factor the real you within
[12:31] there when that nature attacks to it to
[12:33] do all any when you come to a from
[12:36] telling the your return guard down then
[12:38] that makes her stays attached to that
[12:39] solvent and you have to give an account
[12:41] because you're still alive
[12:43] there was no death there has to be de ad
[12:47] and that's the name of my sermon this
[12:48] afternoon is going something must die
[12:52] some kinda yeah okay something's got
[12:55] that because look if you're if your
[12:59] sister Rebeka your husband's packing
[13:02] your freedom Emery and there's no
[13:04] consequence there's no scripture that
[13:07] says she came down anymore but there's
[13:09] nothing there's no say that's why I said
[13:11] now when we read there is therefore now
[13:13] no condemnation think of yourself and
[13:16] even the situations that you're in now
[13:19] there's condemning you you're the only
[13:21] one is condemning you've got nothing now
[13:26] the things we do every day yes we get
[13:27] condemned and we say sorry Lord forgive
[13:31] me sorry I did that I I a situation
[13:39] yesterday and I'm just going to tell it
[13:42] I'm like that pretty much other still I
[13:44] I didn't tell a lot I told a little
[13:48] widely okay but it wasn't a full truth
[13:51] and I apologize that my total lady has
[13:53] to a compliment and check I'll go back
[13:55] and check to make sure but there was a
[13:56] customer told me a long time ago you can
[13:58] leave your package he didn't say you can
[14:02] leave it at my mailbox but he said if
[14:04] I'm not here you can leave it down there
[14:06] well down there I mean his mailbox is a
[14:08] mile from his house he's got one of the
[14:11] communities where there's like ten boxes
[14:13] and everybody lives in this
[14:15] and I hear they all come to a little
[14:16] place so I told the guy he can lay them
[14:19] laying across them it was a big old long
[14:22] thing gone from somebody and he
[14:25] explained and there was no problem with
[14:26] that but I told her I said all he told
[14:28] me we could do that well then I felt
[14:31] that look that look that little back up
[14:36] this Dominica I think is actually what
[14:38] he saying so anyway so you straighten it
[14:41] out though so you keep going home and
[14:43] and like him today you like I like
[14:45] worried about it now no you'll still be
[14:48] worried about but if you'll get rid of
[14:49] it right in five minutes you didn't take
[14:51] five minutes and get rid of that get it
[14:53] done and then I give you an example
[14:55] today that you're not all perfect but
[14:58] you know what there's something inside
[15:00] of me because they used to tell them all
[15:01] the time when I wasn't in when the Lord
[15:03] wasn't inside he used to tell them all
[15:05] the time and you know what there was no
[15:07] condemnation okay because there was no
[15:10] condemned ER in there there was no judge
[15:12] you know so you see that so that's how
[15:17] you know that God's at least try to keep
[15:22] us time keeping straight yeah cuz we're
[15:26] warlocks you've done the same thing
[15:28] you've told a little something maybe not
[15:30] a half drinker not exactly you know
[15:33] exactly verbatim what the guy said or if
[15:37] everybody don't want the person say or
[15:39] you know what you you're talking about
[15:40] something to happen and it really didn't
[15:44] happen exactly that way okay we're
[15:47] humans human being but there is what
[15:50] there is a grace there that the inside
[15:54] guy never did that so what the inside
[15:56] got doing is now he's going come on man
[15:58] that didn't come from me I come from
[16:02] that spirit realm part that comes from
[16:04] this part that walks around out here in
[16:05] this world could we really RPP we have a
[16:10] spiritual being of us that day we do the
[16:14] things of life right then there's an
[16:17] inside of the inside of this profession
[16:19] eternally never standing it never had a
[16:21] bad day it never had a pain but we gotta
[16:25] realize to let that person work we have
[16:28] let others work and by the time they got
[16:33] through the filter about here it got so
[16:35] diluted until you know we thought they
[16:39] were okay know things a little bit when
[16:40] that little tug hits you you go wait a
[16:42] minute let me correct that that way if I
[16:45] correct it now ain't gotta correct it 10
[16:46] years from now or 10 minutes from now or
[16:48] invade from them so anyway let's get
[16:52] into what we were done back in romans
[16:53] but there's no respect of persons with
[16:56] God we kind of I want to laugh back over
[16:58] but we came on the back right here for
[17:01] as many of us have sinned without the
[17:03] law shall also perish without law and
[17:05] it's meaning that stand in the law shall
[17:07] be judged by the law tonight stomach the
[17:09] Old Testament and if you're not born
[17:12] again you're gonna perish without the
[17:14] law as many as that stand in the law
[17:16] shall be judged by the law now look if
[17:19] we're born again today we're not judged
[17:21] by the law
[17:23] we're hitting in the Word of God okay
[17:27] that's why we won't go to judgment what
[17:31] won't go to jail no way male but I've
[17:36] been judged because of what I accepted
[17:39] inside that new birth is what took the
[17:45] old birth and knowledge I'm not the son
[17:48] of Charles another Brandon brother
[17:50] around said well now what was he talking
[17:51] about he remembered he was an alien no
[17:55] he just knew who was working in his life
[17:57] right now what he's going to interpolate
[18:00] for three verses he made a statement in
[18:05] verse 12 for may have sampled alcohol
[18:08] shall also perish without law and if man
[18:10] have sinned in the law shall be judged
[18:12] by the law now if you'll skip all that
[18:13] in the day when God
[18:16] secrets of men by Jesus Christ part of
[18:18] my gospel that's a little cut and drive
[18:21] but when he interpolates what when we
[18:23] come to missus now for not the error of
[18:25] the law are just before God but the doer
[18:28] of the law shall be justified Collini
[18:31] Old Testament truly they made it a book
[18:33] Ruth than it was because it was written
[18:35] down says do this don't do that
[18:37] right for when the Gentiles which have
[18:41] not the law in other words they were
[18:42] covered under the law do by nature of
[18:45] the things contained in the law in other
[18:48] words just like what brother have said
[18:49] about these virtues there's many people
[18:51] in this world that have natural virtue
[18:54] knowledge temperance patience now
[18:55] there's a lot of people that they just
[18:57] don't get mad that don't mean one thing
[18:59] that they're Christian know one thing if
[19:03] you're not born again that you don't
[19:04] want to know they just got in nature
[19:06] their DNA from this one and this one
[19:08] initial initial there's a nature that
[19:10] falls down to do all that good or bad
[19:13] yes your husband is just like that you
[19:15] can't make Mukhtar lad but now if he's
[19:18] not born again that's not the temper if
[19:20] we're talking about right okay they all
[19:22] right with that
[19:23] so let's so by nature the Gentiles did
[19:26] these things you know that was a good
[19:28] Gentile they had everyone just a bunch
[19:30] of sure they were label called heathens
[19:34] but you had some good Gentiles that that
[19:37] God went to like the Corinthian do you
[19:40] think well they were pretty bad him you
[19:41] know God God went to the Corinthians and
[19:44] he went to the Thessalonians and he went
[19:46] to the Romans and you know what he done
[19:47] he converted a group of people that was
[19:49] in there so there must be something
[19:52] about them that he like
[19:53] listen if God ever attaches itself to
[19:56] anything it's because he likes it
[19:59] do you see something we don't see a man
[20:02] comes remember brother Ron said wink
[20:05] when the Spirit came down like the DOS
[20:07] says behold this is my beloved Son in
[20:09] whom I'm pleased to dwell that's the
[20:12] same thing happen at your new birth God
[20:15] comes in your soul burns the old nature
[20:17] out it says I am pleased to be right
[20:19] here
[20:20] Wow yeah wow that's profound you say no
[20:25] I happened Jesus that has ever born
[20:27] again believer it's gotten to go that is
[20:29] the new birth for when the Gentiles have
[20:33] enough to log do by nature the things
[20:35] contained in the law these having not
[20:38] the having not the law are laws
[20:41] themselves then many Gentiles had never
[20:42] ever read Ten Commandments that's why
[20:44] he's talking about they don't have a at
[20:49] that moment in time they didn't have a
[20:51] loan their doorstep or over the door you
[20:54] understand what I'm saying like
[20:55] everybody's going out in the front yard
[20:59] but there are laws themselves now see I
[21:01] like this because I see grace in this
[21:05] because of heathen natives Indians never
[21:09] heard of Jesus Christ they're gonna be
[21:11] judged the property guy said by what by
[21:13] their life by their law not the ten
[21:16] commandments by their law which show the
[21:20] work of the law written in their hearts
[21:21] their conscience also bearing witness
[21:24] and their thoughts the meaning while
[21:27] accusing or else excusing one another in
[21:30] other words their conversation and honey
[21:35] it's going pretty we want to strike this
[21:37] week so we won't see a bunch of that and
[21:40] the day when God shall judge the secrets
[21:42] of men hearts by Jesus Christ according
[21:45] to my gospel he's won over that last
[21:48] Sunday behold our called a Jew and rest
[21:52] us in the wall and make us the most of
[21:54] God now remember he's sitting there
[21:56] talking to Jews but he's heading to the
[21:58] Romans so he's got to take one he's got
[22:00] to the Romans okay and knowest his will
[22:05] and approves the things that are more
[22:07] excellent being instructed out of the
[22:10] law come remember
[22:15] the law and the prophets were until
[22:17] Jesus Christ so the whole Old Testament
[22:20] that was one of the questions that was
[22:22] asked and they said brother Dale said it
[22:27] that the Old Testament Saints got the
[22:30] new birth
[22:32] they ain't never happened never happened
[22:35] and brother they'll never say that but
[22:38] see you see sometimes we formulated in
[22:40] our mind and you do the same thing when
[22:41] you say I saw her I think you need to
[22:44] stop that okay because we laugh with
[22:49] other people but some of you than the
[22:50] last thing we've had other conversations
[22:52] that you've been robbed - so we've all
[22:54] been wrong in ourselves sometime right
[22:57] so but we're going to try to allow them
[23:00] that week that I think this opening of
[23:02] the seals that it ought to be aligned
[23:03] and made perfect and we ought to be able
[23:06] to do it and I say we this vessel
[23:08] brother now we should be confident
[23:12] enough that God can use us to get to you
[23:14] to write them the wrong okay you just
[23:19] gotta listen to the word don't look at
[23:21] the person you know listen to the word
[23:23] listen to what the word said and notices
[23:28] will and approves the things that are
[23:29] more excellent being instructed out of
[23:31] the law and are confident that thou
[23:33] thyself are a godly blind a lot of them
[23:36] with your darkness an instructor of the
[23:39] foolish what which is coming a teacher
[23:41] of AIDS which has the form of knowledge
[23:44] and of the truth and the law all right
[23:46] who don't didn't people now they're
[23:48] worried that thou therefore which
[23:52] teachest another teachest thou not
[23:54] thyself thou that preaches to man should
[23:58] not steal that's now steal now you must
[24:01] have caught something
[24:05] I won't say this and in a way that
[24:09] you'll understand it now where's he
[24:11] going he's going to Rome he's gone the
[24:15] Romans have a spirit about okay the
[24:19] Romans conquered the world and they did
[24:21] horrible things to people in vain and
[24:23] under a religion okay under religion
[24:26] they did that now what's he call as
[24:29] picking up the spirit of that thing
[24:32] because what happened though about forty
[24:34] since another because remember the
[24:36] priest would stand up and they do all
[24:37] their rituals yet they were molesting
[24:40] boys re even had prostitutes there was
[24:44] even one they don't like to do this but
[24:47] if you look back in the history of the
[24:49] Pope's there was a Pope to have
[24:51] concubines yeah okay what do you see if
[24:57] you teach us stuff
[24:58] so what's he doing he's telling them
[24:59] Romans they love you've got you've got
[25:02] guys up there preaching the message and
[25:06] they're doing the same thing that
[25:08] they're saying for you not too big no
[25:09] you have a feeling the message do the
[25:11] same thing I'm saying severity gets
[25:13] known people now that says the man
[25:16] should not commit adultery
[25:19] does now come in the door three
[25:22] you say well I'm not spared no expense
[25:24] still here you've like said we've had
[25:26] people in the message got that priest
[25:28] like a house on fire on the windy day I
[25:30] heard him several times
[25:31] yet he was living with a 14 year old
[25:33] girl and a 30 year old woman and got
[25:36] caught and put in jail and all these
[25:37] things are getting a good deal that he's
[25:39] he's paid his due
[25:40] but he would preach anyone living it
[25:45] gotta come out somewhere
[25:47] now that abhorrest idols thus thou
[25:49] commit sacrilege in other words are you
[25:51] sacrificing things to Heidel and he
[25:55] taught reduced all of the Romans he's
[25:58] talking to that spirit he's not talking
[25:59] to a person he started this spirit we
[26:03] talk to spirits we don't talk to person
[26:05] we talk spirit come a spirit to get on
[26:07] all of us all of us and we got to get
[26:13] rid of those
[26:14] because remember the unclean spirit goes
[26:16] out of a man if you're born again that
[26:19] pert that wasn't in your soul but that
[26:23] could be attached to the outside of the
[26:25] middle man the memory reason cause
[26:26] perspective machinations everybody got
[26:28] back to okay so that's what this is for
[26:32] when the tracks was going out and sister
[26:35] Shepards dream that was trying to inside
[26:36] of that person wasn't in his soul it was
[26:40] in his spirit realm not in the body
[26:42] forget the body forgive divine
[26:45] the body does not sin can't sing it's
[26:49] the product this thing it's dying but it
[26:51] cannot stand without something motivated
[26:53] okay so the trash was going out of the
[26:56] look when you get born again you got
[27:05] every bit of it
[27:07] you got everything you need but now look
[27:12] I'm gonna tell you this afternoon y'all
[27:14] get it a little bit early we can sleep a
[27:16] little while y'all laughs you do because
[27:22] we say them the new persons of Earth of
[27:25] the word that is true to the degree it
[27:30] is not a verse of all the work it's the
[27:34] work of the word that you have and you
[27:37] took believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[27:41] now shall we say Genesis 1:26 that man
[27:43] came to me and my neighbor but no I
[27:47] didn't the day I got born again didn't
[27:50] stand up here and say these things you
[27:52] can sit in the congregation and the
[27:54] listen like you did the first day you
[27:55] got born yet no you weren't listen it's
[27:58] just like it's just like honestly it's
[28:02] just like being married in that first
[28:04] you know honey moment man who cares
[28:06] about bills and where we
[28:11] you know you're just drunk when you and
[28:15] your wife you know is that one thing did
[28:19] you worry the night of your wedding
[28:21] honestly did you worry about paying
[28:23] bills the next two three no you know mom
[28:26] may have but the rest of you come but
[28:31] really I make so god done that he
[28:33] protected you as an uber just a baby
[28:35] right he lets you play a little bit so
[28:39] you've got all this good luck this isn't
[28:41] what I'm saying is is this is not this
[28:44] is not something like well Adele saying
[28:45] no it's not something that comes from
[28:47] somewhere right it's already in there we
[28:51] just gotta live I so it is a birth of
[28:55] the word that you held and that you were
[28:57] born again but it's not a birth of the
[28:58] whole work the whole words there because
[29:02] where do you get your nourishment you
[29:04] get it from the Word of God right
[29:05] preaching studying and all that so it
[29:11] comes from inside but he comes from
[29:14] preaching and you listening and then
[29:16] remember the trash as the pure water
[29:18] proper God said the water of the word
[29:20] was poured in well there was no room for
[29:23] the trash the trash had to come out
[29:25] that's what we got into our spirit realm
[29:27] we've got to let that trash come out and
[29:29] run down and get old you know just keep
[29:32] you know what
[29:33] keep pouring the water in and I'll
[29:36] promise you the trash will come out
[29:39] there was no place for both oh that's
[29:42] why they now getting I'm sorry I get the
[29:46] preaching upstairs though these news in
[29:47] there come on but that's really what you
[29:51] at the new birth the trash is gone
[29:54] there's no trash coming back in your
[29:57] sealed
[29:58] that's why it says sealed until the day
[30:00] of your redemption your seal there's no
[30:02] trash going to get back in there you're
[30:04] done you're finished it's over right but
[30:08] that outside man is still got sticks and
[30:11] stones and all these things you know
[30:14] floating around in it
[30:15] spirit realm well if you don't steal
[30:18] that man man the trash can come right
[30:21] back in that's why when this thing gets
[30:24] sealed off you see what's the whole unit
[30:27] that means in your spirit realm
[30:30] don't worry about the body and your
[30:32] spirit realm gonna steal then Satan
[30:36] that's still about that's when we take
[30:37] the baggage in we're still working but
[30:39] that's the body chain because the body
[30:41] can't be changed one word off so one
[30:45] word off maybe one spit right down here
[30:47] in the corner they may be a little rock
[30:49] or a little stick laying right down here
[30:51] in some of our life but as you keep
[30:54] pouring the water in eventually that
[30:57] little sticks gonna float up and go out
[30:58] the window that's when we're gonna think
[31:00] like why it's going to be hard to do
[31:02] because we've still got a long stick so
[31:03] I wanna pause it now that make us doubt
[31:09] that make us die most of the law through
[31:11] breaking the law of dishonor yes now God
[31:14] switch what he's telling them he said
[31:16] you got preachers that are preaching and
[31:19] they're doing the same thing they're
[31:21] telling you not to do for the name of
[31:23] God is blasphemed among the Gentiles
[31:25] through you as it is written if we go
[31:27] right here for circumcision barely
[31:30] profiteth if thou keep the law listen
[31:36] the Jews right now that debt that let's
[31:42] just say this let's make it let's make
[31:43] it really bad Jesus is standing there
[31:46] now he will circumcise
[31:47] never circumcised the eighth day we know
[31:49] he was circumcised but all the Jews
[31:51] around him were circumcised now the
[31:53] Roman network that were running the
[31:55] court they were uncircumcised
[31:57] but all these Jews that was conscious
[32:00] and all him they were circumcised hey
[32:02] they can go back and say hey look yeah
[32:04] now and I'm doing what the law says Wow
[32:08] they were covered no they're the very
[32:11] ones that cookies on coffee why because
[32:13] their heart their heart their inner
[32:16] being was not
[32:18] so barely circumcised circumcision
[32:22] fairly profiteth if thou keep the law
[32:25] because they all became murderers when
[32:27] they said let his blood be on us and our
[32:29] children that all became murder but if
[32:33] thou be a breaker of the law by
[32:35] circumcision it's made uncircumcision
[32:38] now you can't put the skin back so now
[32:41] he's talking spiritual okay therefore if
[32:45] the uncircumcision keep the
[32:47] righteousness of the law shall not his
[32:49] uncircumcision be counted for seventy
[32:53] because they were some that come under
[32:56] the law that were Gentile
[32:59] remember they were Gentiles and they
[33:03] weren't circumcised now remember some of
[33:05] them went and became circumcised but
[33:08] remember when Paul brought that guy into
[33:10] the temple whoever was Timothy or
[33:14] somebody they must have looked I mean
[33:18] you had a show I guess before you in the
[33:20] temple if you were circumcised you or
[33:22] exercise tell me something they said oh
[33:24] you can file this whole temple you
[33:26] brought this uncircumcised Paul's like
[33:30] guys if y'all walk y'all have missed the
[33:33] point
[33:35] it's not that right therefore in the
[33:37] uncircumcision keep the rottenness of
[33:39] all showing on your thigh sermons you
[33:40] can be coming for certainty not physical
[33:43] okay
[33:45] spiritual and Shona learn circumcision
[33:48] which is by nature if it fulfils a law
[33:52] of judge thing to divide the letter and
[33:54] circumcision does transgress the law no
[33:57] where's the letter had circumcision now
[33:59] all that you can do your transmission
[34:02] the law don't remember the law I brought
[34:05] down as a schoolmaster to bring in the
[34:08] Christ not to save you long they were
[34:12] saved anybody so I said there's no new
[34:15] birth under the law there's no new birth
[34:18] under the Oh
[34:19] Testament because an uber takes you out
[34:21] from under the law but you in Christ
[34:25] because Christ is inside of you listen
[34:28] it's hard to see it's hard to see but
[34:33] Christ was more less thinking let's take
[34:39] Moses I guess you probably in the Old
[34:41] Testament he's probably one of the most
[34:42] powerful prophets that looks right would
[34:44] you say was anybody any more powerful
[34:46] the Moses that had put a veil on his
[34:48] face that presenting God more to the
[34:50] people than anybody else did right even
[34:52] even Christ had to top Moses because
[34:55] Moses said they'll raise up a prophet
[34:56] likened to me Moses did not have God in
[35:00] this office like you do
[35:08] John the Baptist though he received the
[35:10] Holy Ghost somehow somewhere someway he
[35:15] does not did did not have the Holy Ghost
[35:17] in deinstall like him because the least
[35:22] in the kingdom it came to miss the new
[35:25] birth it's greater than John John was
[35:28] the greatest of the prophets now that's
[35:30] the Bible said John was the greatest
[35:31] pray even Jesus then he said what the
[35:34] least in the kingdom was very quiet
[35:35] because John did not have what Jesus was
[35:40] talking about right that's why I'm
[35:43] telling you eternal life is different
[35:45] from the Newbery I see that it's totally
[35:49] different because you can't have the new
[35:53] birth and go before life room you can't
[35:56] have the new birth and not come up in
[35:58] the first resurrection you can't have
[36:00] the new birth and not go through the
[36:02] millennia see what I mean that new birth
[36:05] sends you all the way through that the
[36:10] only way Moses and some of those others
[36:12] are going to be anywhere close to
[36:14] related to us is because remember God
[36:17] was once married to Israel he was
[36:19] married to that group he divorced them
[36:22] now look you say well how can you do
[36:24] that and I see you got to go back
[36:25] American course we may talk about this
[36:26] afternoon a little bit because remember
[36:29] if if I kissed you come into adultery
[36:33] I can't divorce her she's dead she's
[36:37] dead to me now if I can turn them do it
[36:39] everything right you understand what I'm
[36:41] saying and I can marry you again and be
[36:45] perfectly safe it may be being a free
[36:50] truck I'm a virgin or a bit of a priest
[37:01] but same way with Christ he said how can
[37:03] he take Christ put Israel away didn't
[37:07] kill her put her away and divorcement
[37:10] because what she went whoring he caught
[37:14] her commitment okay that's why he can
[37:15] put these denominations on the way and
[37:18] stay married to us because he would
[37:21] technically have a living wife see I
[37:24] would technically have a living wife but
[37:28] in the eyes of God in the Bible if
[37:31] you're called sister's commitment don't
[37:33] do your husband to put you away marry
[37:34] another
[37:34] you're just you're dead to him as
[37:36] anything but now you can't do that you
[37:40] can't do that you came to our class when
[37:43] you don't like him the more right I go
[37:45] to
[37:49] but you see that more clearly we've said
[37:52] under marriage and divorce for 50 years
[37:54] but may I see it's no more clear about
[37:57] what the new birth done cook puts us in
[38:00] a whole different category pulled it
[38:03] kind of and we should feel honored that
[38:06] God did whether we die of a lot of the
[38:12] great what what hap doesn't matter that
[38:14] soul is preserved for eternity
[38:16] [Music]
[38:20] therefore the uncircumcision keep the
[38:22] rockin super long article start from
[38:24] that with no care for he is not a Jew
[38:27] which is one outwardly neither is that
[38:30] circumcision which is outward in the
[38:33] flesh I can show you I'm a Jew that
[38:36] don't mean one thing and you know what
[38:38] it really didn't mean anything to got
[38:39] him in the Old Testament it was a sign
[38:42] that you had done some like what got
[38:45] home today in other words that's a bit
[38:48] let me I just got this fresh you had
[38:52] nothing to do with it you had nothing to
[38:56] do it you ready it was your better they
[39:04] took you to be certified you didn't know
[39:06] how to do it for he is not a Jew which
[39:10] is one outwardly neither is that
[39:12] circumcision which is outward in the
[39:14] flesh but he isn't you never remember
[39:16] keeping your mind he's talking he's
[39:18] going sending this letter to the Romans
[39:20] and he's coming to bring a gospel to the
[39:23] Romans because some of them may be
[39:26] afraid man I had been certain times I'm
[39:28] 57 years old I sure won't go back be
[39:30] physically servants I think don't worry
[39:32] about that we're talking about the
[39:34] circumcision of the heart of the inward
[39:37] man don't worry about that's why I said
[39:39] the flesh has nothing to do it was just
[39:45] a sign any Old Testament because Christ
[39:49] wasn't there to take away off
[39:51] sure Christ was there is an anointing
[39:53] Christ wasn't there is a person to come
[39:56] inside of a but he is a Jew which is one
[40:00] inwardly okay and circumcision is that
[40:04] of the heart in the spirit and not in
[40:10] the letter whose praise is not a man God
[40:18] so it's in the heart whose praise is not
[40:21] of men man we got past chapter 2 because
[40:30] he continues his thought and we'll read
[40:31] there's one more before we cook what
[40:34] advantage then that the Jew because
[40:36] everybody's looking to the Jews as user
[40:37] in the holy city the Jews of it devil
[40:39] wants it turned on them and what profit
[40:43] is there of circumcision much every way
[40:46] chiefly because that unto them that were
[40:48] committed the Oracles of God what is
[40:50] your move of God the Torah then you type
[40:53] the whole tech sergeant in Torah the Old
[40:55] Testament was committed to the Jews to
[40:56] live by that then they turned it down
[40:59] for what if some did not believe believe
[41:02] make the faith of God without faith know
[41:04] where this is why don't believe in 10
[41:05] command so you didn't you so you can
[41:10] take them away that's the same way with
[41:13] God same way now with us and in our life
[41:16] we can't take away all this sir this is
[41:19] no sure the soul is born again but we
[41:23] still gotta live we do live by law
[41:25] listen we do this the law and liberty of
[41:28] Christ
[41:28] that's in the Bible we do live by that
[41:31] law but remember the do's and don'ts is
[41:34] not written as well right okay it's live
[41:38] that's what's gonna be lived on this guy
[41:42] [Music]
[41:43] now I had read the the dialogue but I'll
[41:47] read it next time delay with some good
[41:49] things
