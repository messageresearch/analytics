[13:22] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[13:26] amen 2 Samuel 22
[13:29] 1
[13:31] through3 and and it says and David spake
[13:34] unto the Lord the words of this song in
[13:37] the day that the Lord had delivered him
[13:39] out of the hand of all his enemies out
[13:41] of the hand of Saul and he said the Lord
[13:43] is my rock and my Fortress and my
[13:46] deliverer the god of my rock in him will
[13:49] I trust he is my shield and the Horn of
[13:52] my salvation my high tower and my refuge
[13:55] My Savior thou savest me from violence
[13:59] amen you may be
[14:00] seated and got a couple other scriptures
[14:04] here Psalms 3 and8 says salvation
[14:06] belongeth unto the Lord thy blessing is
[14:09] upon thy people seaw and Jonah 2:9 says
[14:13] I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[14:14] voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that
[14:16] that which I have vowed salvation is of
[14:20] the Lord and that's the reason I
[14:22] entitled this tonight salvation of the
[14:24] Lord and that's one of the reason why I
[14:25] wanted to sing that song tonight Love
[14:28] Lifted Me
[14:30] because when you realize what salvation
[14:32] is as we were speaking when Sunday you
[14:35] know when you look at what salvation is
[14:38] when you see the condition that you were
[14:40] in to see where you what salvation is
[14:42] and what what it brings you
[14:44] to you know when you when you see uh
[14:47] what salvation really means because many
[14:51] people you know they they don't seem to
[14:53] understand what what it means to be
[14:55] saved you know they like to say well I'm
[14:58] saved but you know you know you know
[15:00] they don't really seem to understand
[15:02] what it means to be saved and I love
[15:04] that song I was thinking about that song
[15:05] you know when when I was Sinking Deep in
[15:09] sin far from the peaceful
[15:12] Shore I mean that paints a very Vivid
[15:15] picture to understand where you are at
[15:18] and he come looking for you when you're
[15:20] when there was nothing else I was I was
[15:23] so lost and undone there was no place
[15:25] for me to go I couldn't save myself
[15:28] there was nothing I could do when you
[15:30] realize the condition that you're in
[15:32] that you realize that you have to come
[15:34] to that place that you have to realize I
[15:37] I can't do anything for
[15:38] myself you know as we was talking about
[15:41] the brother R talking about the man
[15:42] being in the river you know when you
[15:45] realize that you know the man was in the
[15:46] river well you know you got to get him
[15:48] out right he said you know you got to
[15:51] get the man out of the river then you
[15:52] got to get the river out of the
[15:54] man and so you you realize the condition
[15:57] and here in the in the message court
[15:59] trial brother says like we claim to be
[16:01] saved they say well show me how you're
[16:03] saved my life proves I'm saved the way I
[16:06] act proves whether I'm saved or not no
[16:08] matter how much I testify about it here
[16:11] you'll know how I live whether I'm saved
[16:14] or not and he said same way with healing
[16:17] if you accept if you accept it you
[16:20] believe see you accept God of his word
[16:24] he says now that word that comes from
[16:27] the Greek word Soo meaning saved just
[16:30] like the materially saved or spiritually
[16:32] saved you're saved Soo he saved her from
[16:35] a premature grave because brother R was
[16:37] talking about the lady with the issue of
[16:38] blood and he came just the same as he
[16:41] saved you from hail Soo the same Greek
[16:43] word is used notice thy faith has Soo
[16:46] saved thee from the sickness that you
[16:48] had notice same word every time and then
[16:52] continue on so here's here's the
[16:54] definition of of Soo means to to save to
[16:58] rescue deliver healed to make make whole
[17:00] to protect keep alive preserve life or
[17:03] to be made whole to rescue deliver from
[17:05] harm from danger or harm to preserve or
[17:07] Guard from injury destruction or loss so
[17:11] when you look to see what it means to be
[17:12] saved you have to see that what you were
[17:16] in a position as we were saying Sunday
[17:18] you you got to realize you were in a
[17:20] position where you were in
[17:22] danger there was this danger and you
[17:25] don't you realize hey I'm lost and just
[17:28] like we about being you know it it's not
[17:30] like being saved where you're talking
[17:33] about you know I had a debt we owed a
[17:35] debt and it's not like owing a bill that
[17:37] you know somebody pays that bill for you
[17:39] the the outcome of this was life and
[17:41] death and so there is there is no other
[17:44] way that you know because when you came
[17:46] you had to as brother brandham was
[17:49] talking about the the young man and he
[17:52] had killed the King's son and when when
[17:55] he had come see when the when the king
[17:57] had come to the man
[17:59] and was asking why did you kill my son
[18:02] and he's like well you know it was an
[18:03] accident I didn't mean to do it but you
[18:05] know he he killed but you know it was a
[18:07] life or death situation you know he was
[18:09] he when when he when the king walked out
[18:11] of that jail cell he thought his life
[18:13] was over with he did not realize but see
[18:17] the the King when he walked out of that
[18:19] jail that jail cell that day when he
[18:21] talked and he saw and had pity and and
[18:24] Grace upon mercy upon that young man he
[18:27] said destroy all the record
[18:30] he said destroy all the records he said
[18:32] there was no record of what took place
[18:35] he said you you you killed my son but he
[18:37] said you'll be my
[18:39] son he said you're going to take that
[18:42] place and he said you know he went in
[18:44] and had him cleaned up and had a put a
[18:45] robe on him and all that and brought him
[18:47] out and he rode with him and the and the
[18:51] vehicle you know and the and the Chariot
[18:52] or whatever it was but you know he he
[18:54] brought him to that place see that's the
[18:55] way it is with salvation you come from a
[18:58] place that you you didn't have we didn't
[19:01] have anything we didn't have you know as
[19:04] as they say we we there was not another
[19:06] way out there there's there's no other
[19:08] options this is it and so when you come
[19:11] to this place and realize I you didn't
[19:13] have another way there's only there's
[19:15] only one way out one way in and and
[19:18] that's through Jesus Christ and you know
[19:21] brother BR was speaking here in in the
[19:22] in the breach when he was talking about
[19:25] Abraham Adam and Eve and you know he
[19:27] said you know they lost their uh claims
[19:31] on eternal life you know here they are
[19:34] in the in the in this great
[19:36] um Eden everything the great condition
[19:39] that they're in everything's perfect
[19:41] there's there's no problems everything's
[19:42] beautiful everything's wonderful but yet
[19:45] brother Bram said because they wanted to
[19:48] try to get wisdom and it said because of
[19:52] of their desire for wisdom it brought
[19:55] death and so here they are they're
[19:57] looking and he said it's the same way
[19:58] with you and I because here they are had
[20:01] everything just the perfect just just
[20:03] exactly the way that it should have been
[20:05] and everything was perfect but God had
[20:07] given them one one stipulation in all of
[20:10] this and he said don't eat of the tree
[20:11] of knowledge of Good and Evil he said
[20:13] everything else you can partake of but
[20:15] you can't partake of that but that's the
[20:17] first thing that that because of of
[20:20] man's nature that was the first thing
[20:23] that that Satan brought to Eve was
[20:25] listen you need to look at this consider
[20:29] this look look what God is doing look
[20:32] look at this plan and and you know and
[20:34] God wants you you know he's trying to
[20:36] keep this from you or whatever it was
[20:38] you know and it's like but she had this
[20:40] knowledge because she was curious about
[20:41] wanting to know what was going on and
[20:43] trying to and it's like but the word
[20:46] said to leave it alone to stay away from
[20:50] it amen and the best and the best policy
[20:53] the best plan was to stay away from it
[20:56] amen when when when God told him to stay
[20:58] away and you know he didn't come he
[21:00] didn't try to bring this to Adam he
[21:01] brought it to Eve that's right and he
[21:04] began to began to speak to her about
[21:06] this and here she is she began to listen
[21:09] to S his sermon he began to listen to
[21:12] what she what he had to say when she
[21:14] should have just said God said we're not
[21:16] supposed to partake of that not even
[21:18] touch it not even have anything to do
[21:19] with it leave it
[21:21] alone but because because of them being
[21:24] brother said because they were on free
[21:25] moral agency see here they are they went
[21:28] to that and they took on that
[21:32] sin because first off you know she had
[21:35] to she had to agree to that before there
[21:38] was ever an act could take place she had
[21:41] to she already had that in her mind that
[21:43] this this was okay everything she she'd
[21:45] overcome all of the obstacles that she
[21:48] had in her mind to over to do that and
[21:50] then all of a sudden then the ACT took
[21:52] place but she had already agreed to that
[21:54] she had already seen that and said oh
[21:56] this is going to be a great wonderful
[21:57] thing not realizing brought
[22:00] death and brother R said see then when
[22:03] you realize see we were born under that
[22:05] sin curse because through Adam because
[22:08] he took Eve and they both sinned and
[22:11] when when all of creation fell then we
[22:13] were born under that sin curse but
[22:16] brother brandom said you know you can't
[22:18] you can't apologize for Adam's sin you
[22:20] can't repent for Adam's sin you can't
[22:22] repent for Eve sin because that's
[22:24] already settled but the only sin that
[22:27] you've got to deal with is your own sin
[22:29] you've got you've got to repent of your
[22:32] own sin see he said that wasn't your
[22:35] fault but he said our our sin is our
[22:37] fault
[22:39] amen our what the sin that we have upon
[22:42] us is our fault and we have we have to
[22:45] answer for that see you have to go to
[22:48] the place and realize you know that you
[22:50] have to brother Bram said here it is in
[22:53] the breach he says see they wanted to
[22:55] find out what it was to have wisdom so
[22:58] they probed into it and it caused death
[23:01] amen and so you have to realize you know
[23:03] you you've got to come to the place that
[23:05] when you see these things that you have
[23:08] to realize it's it's your fault not
[23:10] anybody
[23:12] else's you know one of the places where
[23:14] brother Brandon was talking about that
[23:16] he said brother said that God knows if
[23:18] you're if you're really repentant or
[23:21] not he know H you know you can't you can
[23:23] say well I I you know I I repent and all
[23:26] God knows God knows your heart
[23:28] long before you say anything you know
[23:30] you you don't have you know you're not
[23:32] you can fool a lot of people but you're
[23:33] not going to fool God you're not going
[23:35] to fool him but see when when all of
[23:38] these things came
[23:40] about when the when the when the fall
[23:43] came and we were were born under this
[23:46] sin curse but yet God had a plan for us
[23:49] to come into Fellowship again he made a
[23:52] way for us and here's here's this the
[23:56] plan that you know he always from the
[23:58] beginning he said that he was going to
[24:01] have that enmity between her
[24:03] seat and and the Serpent's seat he'd
[24:06] always but he was going to make a way
[24:08] that bring us back in to fellowship and
[24:11] had everything laid out the the whole
[24:13] plan came into being just perfect all
[24:15] the way down through through time all
[24:18] the prophets began to speak you know and
[24:20] you know all the things you know he had
[24:22] a he had a a sacrifice laid
[24:25] out all the way from the beginning and
[24:28] you know you know because they were they
[24:30] were those like like Seth and and the
[24:34] different ones you know they had a
[24:35] desire for
[24:37] God and those that
[24:39] didn't but you know everybody was on
[24:41] free moral agency everybody was a free
[24:44] moral agent and you know every person
[24:46] had to make their own decision and you
[24:48] see everybody everybody had to choose
[24:51] and you know God's not a respector of
[24:53] persons because he let you make that
[24:55] decision he let them make that decision
[24:57] and you know you know he just laid it
[24:59] out there but you know what there was
[25:00] always a penalty for what they chose to
[25:05] do everybody had to pay the same penalty
[25:09] right but see when you when you see how
[25:11] all these things came about and we know
[25:13] that when Jesus died and he came and he
[25:16] and he took on the this form of sinful
[25:19] flesh and you know he came to take our
[25:22] place to go through the same things that
[25:24] we've went through all the things that
[25:26] we've had to go through in our
[25:29] lives that we can we can take that you
[25:32] know he became what we were to take on
[25:36] sin who knew no sin but he took that on
[25:39] that we could be the very righteousness
[25:41] of God that we could be the
[25:43] righteousness of God that we could be
[25:44] what he is why because that was always
[25:47] the plan of God that's what God always
[25:49] saw of
[25:50] you and it's wonderful to think about
[25:53] when you when you see because you look
[25:55] in the mirror sometimes or maybe all
[25:57] don't I do I look in the mirror
[25:59] sometimes and I and and I think man you
[26:01] know I can just see all my thoughts and
[26:03] failures and all of my problems and all
[26:05] these kind of things and you know and
[26:07] then but sometimes you know the Lord has
[26:10] to come by and or he does me I'm I'm
[26:13] give my testimony today but you know
[26:15] sometimes it's like he smacks you in the
[26:16] face you know you know because you know
[26:18] if we can always live in in a in a in a
[26:21] state of just Gloom and and and sadness
[26:26] and you know and we can sit and you know
[26:28] I mean
[26:28] as as the song you know uh Gloom Despair
[26:31] and Agony on
[26:34] me I mean we we could we could live in
[26:36] that we can live in this world because
[26:37] you know what if if you open the door
[26:40] all you got to do is crack the door and
[26:41] the Devil Comes busting through and and
[26:43] he'll stand on he'll sit on your
[26:44] shoulder and talk in your ear as long as
[26:46] you want him to be there as long as
[26:48] you're welcoming him he'll tell you and
[26:51] you know what that you ain't got a
[26:52] friend in the world there ain't nothing
[26:55] there ain't nothing going
[26:57] right you you just got you got problems
[26:59] morning noon and night and you know it's
[27:01] like why in the world would you even get
[27:03] up out of
[27:08] bed and then and then as as you go
[27:10] through all but you know what it comes
[27:12] all of a sudden there's something that
[27:13] rises up in there and the Lord begins to
[27:15] speak to you and say listen you know
[27:17] what when you realize there's how many
[27:19] billions of people that are in this
[27:21] world out there and you know what he
[27:24] crossed my path to bring me into fellow
[27:28] ship with
[27:30] him I you know there there's nothing
[27:32] good in me there there there's nothing
[27:34] but you know what God's grace came to me
[27:37] and you know what I I was I was a
[27:39] recipient of that there's there's
[27:42] there's nothing because you know because
[27:43] it's not because of my intelligence or
[27:46] my good looks or anything else that that
[27:48] that I could bring that you know that I
[27:50] could say hey this is the reason God
[27:52] chose me because I'm so wonderful
[27:54] there's nothing good about me
[27:58] but praise God because of his mercy and
[28:00] Grace he saw something that you know
[28:03] that that I would receive the gift of
[28:05] eternal life that he give us he did he
[28:08] he he he died so that all might receive
[28:11] but not all will
[28:15] receive and we and we'll see here in in
[28:18] a little bit we'll try to get to it
[28:21] because I don't know how far we'll go
[28:22] but you know you know you see what
[28:23] brother BR talked about you know when
[28:25] when you become he he wants to be your
[28:28] Savior and Lord
[28:31] am but you know people only want to be
[28:34] they only want him to be their
[28:37] savior but they come to that place that
[28:39] you know they don't want to go any
[28:40] further than
[28:42] that and see when you when you come to
[28:44] this place to realize who you are and
[28:46] and what God's done for you and you know
[28:48] when when Jesus died and rose again and
[28:52] told them and told the disciples you
[28:55] know that that to T in Jerusalem
[28:58] until you be endued with power from on
[29:00] high and begin to tell them that the
[29:03] spirit would
[29:05] come that he that I'm going to go away
[29:09] but the spirit that dwells in me will
[29:12] dwell on dwell in
[29:14] you and it'll be the exact same
[29:17] thing and he said you know what' he say
[29:19] the works that I do shall you do
[29:23] also he said and here he is he said my
[29:26] the father and I will take up our abod
[29:28] in
[29:31] you and here he is then you know that
[29:33] that you will know that I'm in the
[29:35] Father the father in me and I in
[29:39] you when you wake up in the morning the
[29:42] devil's like well you know what I
[29:44] wouldn't get out of bed well you know
[29:45] what I ain't listening to you
[29:49] today you know because you know there
[29:51] you know because it's like well devil
[29:53] you know I'm not listening to you today
[29:56] I a because you know what there ain't
[29:57] there ain't no truth ever been found in
[30:00] you but you know we can we can sit and
[30:03] listen to that but you know what there's
[30:04] not the the truth is not in
[30:06] it and you know the devil's lying to you
[30:08] when he's talking to
[30:11] you but see when when when the Holy
[30:14] Spirit came that day when when the
[30:16] disciples were
[30:17] there and they were in the upper room
[30:20] waiting teing for the the Fulfillment of
[30:23] the scripture that the that the Holy
[30:25] Spirit would come and take up and dwell
[30:27] inside of them them when when that when
[30:29] the spirit came and it came inside of
[30:31] them and they began to
[30:33] speak speak in other tongues you know
[30:37] when when the Holy Spirit came and they
[30:39] come out of that room as drunk men you
[30:42] know here here they are the the scared
[30:44] group of people standing there and all
[30:46] of a sudden here they come out of that
[30:49] room Fearless here they are coming out
[30:52] walking and they didn't care what people
[30:55] thought of them why because they they
[30:58] were in the in the in living in
[31:00] something that had that was that had
[31:01] never happened before here's something
[31:04] somebody had the indwelling of the holy
[31:06] spirit inside of them and they begin to
[31:07] walk out and Proclaim what the word said
[31:10] for their day and when they when they
[31:12] walked out there and you know and here
[31:13] they are standing there and everybody
[31:15] was like you know these these people
[31:16] must be drunk and you know here they are
[31:19] full of new wine but you know the
[31:21] scripture says but Peter standing there
[31:23] telling them he said this is this is not
[31:25] that but but he began to speak to them
[31:29] and he began to speak to them and tell
[31:31] them he
[31:32] said verse 14 I'm I'm I'm trying to skip
[31:36] some of this because I don't want to
[31:37] step up here all night trying to read to
[31:38] y'all but I got I got multiple quotes
[31:41] but I'm just trying to instead of stand
[31:44] up here reading but I W read this but he
[31:45] said Peter standing up with the 11
[31:47] lifted up his voice and said unto him ye
[31:49] men of Judea and all ye that dwell at
[31:51] Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[31:54] hearken to my words for these are not
[31:55] drunken as you suppose sing it is but
[31:57] the third hour the day but this is that
[32:00] which was spoken by the prophet jel and
[32:01] it shall come to pass in the last day
[32:03] saith God I will pour out my spirit upon
[32:06] All Flesh and your sons and your
[32:08] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[32:10] men shall see visions and your old men
[32:12] shall dream dreams and upon my servants
[32:14] and upon my hen men will I pour out my
[32:16] SP in those days of my spirit and they
[32:19] shall
[32:21] prophesy and it continues on and and so
[32:24] we're just dropping down to verse 21 it
[32:25] says and it shall come to pass that who
[32:27] whoever shall call upon the name of the
[32:29] Lord shall be saved you men of Israel
[32:32] hear these words Jesus Christ of
[32:33] Nazareth a man approved to God among you
[32:36] by Miracles and wonders and signs which
[32:37] God did by him in the midst of you as
[32:40] you yourselves also know so here when
[32:44] when they began to speak of this and the
[32:45] first thing that Peter's doing when in
[32:47] in the in the 11 when they begin to
[32:49] speak of this then they turn around and
[32:50] the first thing that he does is say this
[32:53] is the Fulfillment of the scripture of
[32:55] the Prophet Joel and then he turns
[32:57] around and tells him he said but though
[32:58] who that calls upon the name of the Lord
[33:00] shall be saved and as soon as he says it
[33:03] the next verse Peter begins to point
[33:06] them right back to Jesus and says Jesus
[33:08] Christ of Nazareth whom you have
[33:10] crucified is the Fulfillment and he
[33:12] begins to lay out all the things that
[33:15] the that David had said in the Psalms
[33:17] and begins to preach that whole message
[33:19] and show them who Jesus Christ was
[33:22] because here it is the the message so
[33:24] what is what is the the uh message what
[33:28] is it because it takes the word but what
[33:30] is it when the Holy Spirit comes and it
[33:32] begins to manifest what does he do he
[33:34] manifests the word so he brings the word
[33:36] into manifestation to the people and he
[33:38] begins to preach the word to the
[33:42] people that's right so that is what what
[33:45] was the Holy Spirit Come to do it's it's
[33:47] not to birth us into the kingdom but
[33:49] it's also to bring the
[33:53] word and so when he when he begins to
[33:56] after he as as he begins to preach this
[33:59] message and he says see here it is in
[34:02] verse 36 here here's the the disciples
[34:05] preaching this message and it says
[34:07] therefore let all the house of Israel
[34:09] know
[34:11] assuredly that same God that made that
[34:14] made that same Jesus whom ye have
[34:16] crucified both Lord and
[34:18] Christ and he said when they heard
[34:22] this now they were picked in their heart
[34:24] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[34:26] the Apostles men and Brethren while what
[34:27] shall we do then Peter said unto them
[34:30] reent and be
[34:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[34:35] the remission of sins and you shall
[34:37] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[34:38] the promise is unto you and to your
[34:40] children and to them that are far off
[34:41] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[34:44] call and with many other words he did
[34:45] testify and exhort saying save yourself
[34:48] from this UNT generation so when he
[34:51] began to speak said who whoever will
[34:53] call on the name of the Lord shall be
[34:56] saved and when he when he preaches that
[34:58] see when he brings that out and they ask
[35:00] him said what shall we do to be saved
[35:03] like I said Sunday he didn't just say
[35:05] believe on the
[35:06] Lord just just just well you know I make
[35:10] a
[35:12] decision it wasn't making a
[35:14] decision the first thing that he done
[35:16] was what do you do to be saved he said
[35:18] to
[35:20] repent and what do it mean to repent it
[35:22] means to change your ways change your
[35:24] action the direction that you're going
[35:27] amen yeah here you are changing he said
[35:29] see repent and be baptized in the name
[35:31] of Jesus Christ for the remission of of
[35:34] your sins he said for the promises unto
[35:36] you and your
[35:37] children and to them that are far off
[35:40] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[35:42] call so here here is here is the whole
[35:45] Plan of Salvation when you and you see
[35:48] how it came that when you have to what
[35:50] does it mean to to have to be saved what
[35:53] do you have to do to be saved what do
[35:55] you have to do you have to repent yes
[35:58] first you got to realize that that
[36:00] you're lost that you need a savior that
[36:03] you're not in the right condition you're
[36:04] not right in the right position you're
[36:06] not in right Fellowship when you come to
[36:08] that place then you realize what do you
[36:10] have to do well the first thing you got
[36:12] to do is realize there's a savior there
[36:14] there is a plan and he's reaching out to
[36:17] you and all you got to do is accept and
[36:19] the first thing he says to do is
[36:23] repent and you got to real and then all
[36:25] you do is repent and accept that
[36:30] amen now Sunday I was I asked everybody
[36:34] about
[36:37] uh what if they if they knew what
[36:39] lordship salvation
[36:40] was
[36:42] and so I just want to I just want to
[36:45] bring this out a little bit he said
[36:47] lordship salvation has anybody ever
[36:49] heard of
[36:51] that well I was and the and the reason
[36:55] I'm I'm I'm going to get into the
[36:57] scripture here in a minute but uh what I
[37:00] was listen I was listening to somebody
[37:02] and uh all of a sudden when I heard when
[37:05] I heard him began to this man and he was
[37:07] talking about this topic and I'd never
[37:10] heard it so I was like hey I'm gonna
[37:11] listen to this it sounded pretty neat so
[37:13] I started listening to it and he began
[37:16] to quote
[37:18] scripture and when he started to quote
[37:20] scripture there something that caught my
[37:22] attention and that's what that's what
[37:24] made me think of this but it says
[37:25] lordship salvation points to Jesus Jesus
[37:27] repeated warnings to the religious
[37:29] Hypocrites of his day as proof that
[37:31] simply agreeing to spiritual facts does
[37:34] not save a person there must be a heart
[37:36] change Jesus emphasized the high cost of
[37:41] discipleship for John Luke 14 says
[37:44] whosoever doth not bear his cross and
[37:47] come after me cannot be my disciple so
[37:49] likewise whosoever he be of you that
[37:52] forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot
[37:55] be my disciple amen so when you're when
[37:57] you're looking at what it means to be
[38:00] when when they talk
[38:02] about what what it means in in lordship
[38:05] Salvation is the is the term and well
[38:09] because really it's just salvation but
[38:12] it's the new term that people use uh you
[38:15] know because you know people want a
[38:17] savior but they don't want a
[38:19] lord so this this is this is their this
[38:22] is their new uh buzzword that they like
[38:25] to use this is their catchphrase or
[38:27] whatever
[38:28] but it says see it says repentance is a
[38:31] change of mind from Embrace of sin and
[38:34] rejection of Christ to a rejection of
[38:36] sin and embrace of
[38:38] Christ and even this is a gift of God
[38:42] genuine repentance when comes which
[38:45] comes when a person submits to the
[38:47] lordship of
[38:50] Christ cannot help but result in a
[38:53] change of behavior
[38:58] see brother Bram says here and
[39:01] and is that right
[39:04] yeah from uncertain sound brother man
[39:07] says repent means to turn around leave
[39:08] your belief behind start up the road
[39:10] believing God towards Calvary turn
[39:12] around start up the road and you will
[39:14] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:17] you shall receive it if you follow the
[39:20] plan and here is here it is from proving
[39:24] his word says see a lot of people want
[39:27] Jesus to be their savior but not their
[39:30] lord see Lord is ruler yeah you say
[39:33] Jesus you saved me and let me stand
[39:36] right here and that's all right and I'll
[39:38] do my own business now you don't get in
[39:41] my business but you see you can be my
[39:44] savior but not my Lord he wants to be
[39:47] Lord you see then he's your
[39:51] savior so there's a people get it all
[39:54] out of out of
[39:57] the the way it should be they get it all
[40:00] backwards because they well I I want to
[40:01] I want a savior because I don't want to
[40:03] go to hell but it doesn't but they don't
[40:05] want to surrender they don't want to
[40:07] give up everything what it takes to come
[40:11] to that place but
[40:13] see in in Romans here
[40:18] see verse 13 for whosoever shall call
[40:21] upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
[40:24] he said then how shall they call on him
[40:27] in whom they have not believed and how
[40:29] shall they believe in whom they have not
[40:32] heard and how shall they hear without a
[40:36] preacher and how shall they preach
[40:38] except they be sent it says how
[40:40] beautiful are the feet of
[40:42] them that bring the good the preach the
[40:45] gospel of peace and bring Good Tidings
[40:47] of good things he says so then Faith
[40:49] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[40:53] word of God see when you realize see it
[40:56] takes the faith
[40:57] and so you realize somebody's got to
[40:59] bring you the gospel you've got to hear
[41:01] the gospel you've got to hear the word
[41:04] you know it's just like well you know I
[41:05] you know I just just woke up one day and
[41:08] and had this realization no you got to
[41:09] hear the word it takes the word because
[41:12] the word is what bring births you so
[41:15] you've got to hear the word so that's
[41:16] what brings the message there's got to
[41:19] be somebody that's got to speak to you
[41:21] you got to hear it from
[41:22] somebody so you just can't just get it
[41:25] just right out of the right out of the
[41:27] ether you know it takes it takes
[41:30] somebody that it's got to come through
[41:32] the body the the seeds got to come
[41:33] through the body the words got to come
[41:35] forth so you can hear
[41:40] it now I'm gonna skip up just a
[41:45] minute but when when when you look at
[41:49] this this term this U lordship salvation
[41:54] is what they were calling him but this
[41:56] man was was quoting these things and
[42:00] this is this is one of the scriptures
[42:02] that this man was speaking of and what
[42:04] this is what caught my attention Luke
[42:06] 23:39 when it talks about the maleactors
[42:08] he said if the one says if thou be
[42:10] Christ save yourself and us and the
[42:12] other one says other answer rebuked him
[42:15] saying dust thou not fear God seeing
[42:16] that thou art in the same condem
[42:19] condemnation he said we indeed justly
[42:21] for we received the due reward of our
[42:23] Deeds but this man ha done nothing a
[42:25] miss and he said unto Jesus Lord
[42:28] remember me when thou comest into thy
[42:31] kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I
[42:34] say unto thee today Thou shalt be with
[42:37] me in
[42:39] Paradise when this scripture was read
[42:41] this man was speaking on this topic and
[42:43] when he read that scripture there was a
[42:47] a missing word and that's what caught my
[42:51] attention because when and I was like I
[42:55] want to check on this so I went to the
[42:56] emphatic
[42:58] diaglot and I want to read this and and
[43:00] this is this is the way it's written in
[43:01] the TIC diaglot verse 42 and he said to
[43:05] thee Jesus do thou Remember Me Oh Lord
[43:09] when thou comest into the kingdom of
[43:13] thee and when you go
[43:15] back I brought my emphatic dolot
[43:19] today but you know when I was looking
[43:21] because it's but it's in here but when
[43:23] you go back and look the new
[43:26] translations don't don't put the word
[43:28] Lord in that
[43:30] verse verse 42 does not have the word
[43:33] Lord in it it's missing go back and
[43:37] look and in the emphatic diaglot you
[43:40] know where that comes
[43:42] from the Vatican
[43:46] translation because if you look in here
[43:48] under Luke 23 it says
[43:53] omit and they took that word out
[43:57] and when I and so when when this man
[43:59] began to quote this scripture he was he
[44:02] was talking about the man on the thief
[44:04] on the cross and talking to Jesus and he
[44:06] was and that's what that's what struck
[44:08] me I was
[44:09] like he never used the word
[44:12] Lord and then he began to go and I was
[44:14] like oh I see that now because this new
[44:19] translations they don't put that in
[44:20] there and that's what that's what struck
[44:23] that's what struck me was when when he
[44:24] was talking about that how how they lay
[44:27] this out that you're missing these words
[44:31] and all of a sudden it's like well the
[44:32] the Bible doesn't say that the Bible
[44:35] doesn't say this the Bible doesn't say
[44:38] that and it's like yeah that's what the
[44:40] Bible
[44:41] says but you miss
[44:43] it see here they are missing these
[44:50] things and all a sudden when you realize
[44:52] you know he said Lord when when you come
[44:54] into my into the kingdom
[44:57] remember me and he said Thou shalt be
[44:59] with me this day in paradise brother BR
[45:02] says
[45:05] here and remembering the Lord he says
[45:08] Lord is ownership he said the landlord
[45:10] owns the land and the people today
[45:12] they'll glad to accept Jesus for a
[45:14] savior they don't want to go to hell
[45:16] they'll accept him as a savior but when
[45:18] it comes to the Lord oh uh-uh oh no uhuh
[45:21] Lord is you to be his property if he
[45:27] wants a floor mat he makes you a floor
[45:28] mat and you're just as happy a floor
[45:31] matat as you would be a morning star he
[45:34] said we don't want him to be Lord we
[45:36] want a savior but we don't want Lord
[45:39] then he comes Lord and he speaks to you
[45:42] about certain things of the word well
[45:45] now I don't know about that now see well
[45:48] just I just can't imagine me doing that
[45:49] you you ladies here you say I I get
[45:52] tired after a while no I
[45:55] won't so see it's like well you know I I
[45:58] get to this point well you know I I
[46:00] don't know about this I don't know about
[46:02] this but you know they they won't they
[46:05] want just pick and choose in the word
[46:08] what they want but they don't want to
[46:09] take all the word they don't want to
[46:11] receive everything here they are they
[46:13] they pick this and it's like well you
[46:15] know I well I you know I don't want I
[46:17] don't want to live that kind of life
[46:18] because you know if if I had to if I had
[46:20] to live like that then you know people
[46:23] people may make fun of me people wonder
[46:25] why you know but you know if if you are
[46:29] sold
[46:31] out you know because if if if you
[46:36] were in a in a in a certain
[46:39] condition like you know somebody rescues
[46:43] you out of the
[46:44] water you know if you're if you have if
[46:47] you have some kind of medical experience
[46:49] you you have some kind of heart attack
[46:51] and somebody rushes you to the hospital
[46:53] you know I mean you know if you're dying
[46:55] and you're going into the hospital you
[46:57] know it's like I really don't care uh
[47:00] you know because everybody's like well
[47:01] you know we hate going to the doctor
[47:03] because you know it's very uh we think
[47:06] it's kind of degrading it's kind of uh
[47:09] because sometimes you know there's no
[47:11] modesty in in the hospital sometimes you
[47:13] know it's just you just go in and you
[47:15] know they just start working on you and
[47:16] everything you know how it is and you
[47:18] know and it's like well you know I don't
[47:19] I don't want to have to go through that
[47:22] you know but if but if you're actually
[47:24] going through something if you're dying
[47:25] you get to that place you know what it
[47:27] don't
[47:30] matter you know I mean it's just like
[47:32] people that that's went through uh you
[47:35] know PE people that's went through fires
[47:37] you know when they when they go through
[47:39] when people have been burnt and you know
[47:41] when when they come out some people
[47:43] don't have clothes
[47:45] on and some some people when they're on
[47:47] fire and their clothes are on fire you
[47:49] know what modesty's
[47:52] gone because what do they do they're
[47:54] pulling they're pulling that stuff off
[47:55] of them why because they're trying try
[47:56] to preserve their life all of a sudden
[47:59] here they are they're just trying to
[48:00] shed these
[48:02] things why because they're trying
[48:04] because they're not worried about what
[48:05] everybody else is thinking what
[48:07] everybody else why because they're
[48:08] they've got to this place where it's
[48:09] life or death and you know what they
[48:11] they want to get to
[48:13] that and so when you see these things
[48:15] it's like I don't care what everybody
[48:17] else
[48:19] thinks when when you when you see what
[48:21] God's done for you it's like I don't
[48:23] care if nobody else baptizes acts 238
[48:27] that's right if everybody else thinks
[48:29] we're weird because we but you know what
[48:31] I you know I just take it right back to
[48:33] the
[48:34] scripture you know what that because
[48:36] when he said baptize in the name of the
[48:39] father Son and the Holy Ghost well you
[48:41] know what there's only one time that you
[48:42] see there was a name where people were
[48:45] baptized when the day when the Holy
[48:47] Ghost fell and they indwelled those
[48:50] people Peter didn't go back and quote
[48:53] act Matthew 28:19
[48:57] not the way people think because he said
[48:59] we're going to do this in the name of
[49:00] Jesus Christ because of according to
[49:03] verse 36 there he said that same Jesus
[49:06] whom you've crucified God has made him
[49:08] both Lord and
[49:12] Christ so when you see what what he done
[49:16] and then when you come to this place
[49:17] realize I I don't care if people don't
[49:20] see these things because you know you're
[49:22] not going to change people's mind
[49:25] because you know we're here to Proclaim
[49:26] the truth but you know what it's not
[49:28] we're not here to to win people over
[49:30] because that's God's job God Saves
[49:34] people all you do is proclaim the word
[49:35] you seow the seed but God does the
[49:39] rest because you know what when it comes
[49:41] to comes to the message you know because
[49:44] God put in the scripture that we see
[49:46] there was a there was a need for an end
[49:48] time Prophet because the word had to
[49:51] come to a prophet the word had to be
[49:53] revealed because he had to fulfill
[49:55] Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 those scriptures
[49:58] had to be fulfilled in our day and
[50:00] whether people sees that or not that's
[50:04] immaterial what what do you believe I
[50:07] believe that God had to had to fulfill
[50:09] the scripture in our day we can see all
[50:11] the way through the church ages how
[50:13] things went you know and what God
[50:17] done we we see that how how the seed
[50:20] that was back there at Pentecost had to
[50:22] die and go into the ground but it had to
[50:24] come back in a resurrection it had to
[50:26] come
[50:29] back we we know we had to come through
[50:31] the Dark Ages all those things that took
[50:33] place we can we can see the whole plan
[50:35] of God but you know that's so we see
[50:38] that hey you know what there people come
[50:40] along you know there was nobody back
[50:42] there that was ever baptized and and you
[50:44] go back before the Catholics came in and
[50:47] they started to have
[50:49] the the Nan fathers and all that there
[50:52] wasn't there was none of that nobody got
[50:55] baptized that way
[50:57] there was there was nobody preaching
[50:58] that as a
[51:02] godhead why because the same because the
[51:05] people that came from from back there
[51:08] they were come from a Jewish background
[51:11] why because there was only one
[51:14] God when the Messiah would come who
[51:17] would be the Messiah it was God made
[51:19] flesh not another
[51:21] person so when Paul began to preach the
[51:25] gospel when he began to preach he was
[51:27] not bringing another gospel he was
[51:29] preaching exactly what was preached back
[51:32] there he was preaching exactly what
[51:34] Moses preached and the prophets what
[51:37] David had spoke amen when he came he
[51:40] began to bring all those things back
[51:42] into
[51:45] view he was not a
[51:49] trinitarian but you can't but you can't
[51:51] get people to believe that you can't get
[51:53] people to see that
[51:58] and they'll fight you tooth and
[52:02] nail and it's like you can't sometimes
[52:04] you can't have conversation with people
[52:06] because you the first thing
[52:08] like how dare you not believe the
[52:14] Trinity and it and it's like but that
[52:16] but that's not what what it supposed to
[52:19] be but that's the way that that's the
[52:22] way people have preached it amen
[52:31] but see here's brother Brown
[52:36] speaking he said did you notice the
[52:38] Bible speaking of this church in this
[52:41] day because thou sayest that I am rich
[52:44] the richest times the church has ever
[52:46] had most prosperous age the church has
[52:48] ever lived in is now great buildings
[52:50] fine places educated scholar ministers
[52:53] he said we got better ministers than we
[52:56] ever had had got better churches than we
[52:58] ever had we got the world sinking every
[53:00] day into sin he said got weaker pull
[53:03] pits than than we ever had and that's
[53:07] why people they don't want to surrender
[53:09] themselves to God they don't want Oh
[53:13] They'll say I'm saved I let Jesus save
[53:16] me but you won't let him be Lord so he
[53:19] won't stay with you long that's the
[53:22] reason you go back into the world again
[53:25] that's exactly right
[53:29] I thought that was real interesting when
[53:30] I read that he says well I'm saved I let
[53:34] Jesus saved
[53:37] me well there ain't no letting about
[53:40] it no you had you had to
[53:44] surrender just like we was talking about
[53:46] somebody when you if you're drowning in
[53:48] a pool you know when when when the
[53:50] Lifeguard jumps in water you've got to
[53:52] surrender
[53:54] amen like you you get somebody out out
[53:56] there that you know they're going to
[53:57] fight you and you know panic and
[53:59] everything like that they'll drown
[54:02] you you can't you can't get them
[54:05] out but what happens when somebody's
[54:08] drowned in the pool and all of a sudden
[54:09] you know whatever you tell them to do
[54:12] they're going to do it
[54:16] 100% they're going under the water and
[54:18] you put something there and and you just
[54:20] tell them to hang on and rest and relax
[54:26] it's like well I don't think this is the
[54:27] way we ought to go out of the pool I
[54:29] don't think this the way we ought to get
[54:29] out of the water why are you going this
[54:32] way why are you going that
[54:34] way no if your lungs are full of water
[54:36] and all of a sudden somebody brings you
[54:38] the life preserver and you're just
[54:39] hanging on and somebody else is trying
[54:41] to swim out you know what I don't care
[54:42] which way they
[54:44] go I'm trusting them why because I'm in
[54:47] a position that I that I'm trying to get
[54:51] out and it's the same way with you and I
[54:53] we see when you're when you're in this
[54:55] position then you got work your got to
[54:57] follow the plan and like Lord I'm going
[54:59] to trust you cuz I don't know which way
[55:01] to go when you realize hey I'm me I'm
[55:04] lost and I can't make it and every day
[55:08] we go through the same thing because how
[55:10] many how many woke up this morning I
[55:11] need more of God today than I did
[55:13] yesterday I need more of God tomorrow
[55:16] than I had
[55:17] today why because the journey is is
[55:21] greater the battle is greater but every
[55:23] day but you know what he's there to lead
[55:25] us amen and got us all the way bring us
[55:32] through and here's a here's another
[55:36] scripture when I was listening to this
[55:38] man speaking he was speaking
[55:40] of of he was speaking of Paul and being
[55:45] in the prison in Acts 16 and he said and
[55:49] begin to speak of the The Keeper of the
[55:50] prison and he said and The Keeper of the
[55:52] prison waking out of his sleep and
[55:54] seeing the prison doors open he drew out
[55:56] his sword and would have killed himself
[55:58] supposing that the the prisoners had
[56:00] been fled but Paul cried with a loud
[56:02] voice saying do thyself no harm for we
[56:04] are all here then he cried for a light
[56:07] and sprang in and came trembling and
[56:09] fell down before Paul and Silas and
[56:12] brought them out and said s what must I
[56:15] do to be
[56:19] saved and they said believe on the Lord
[56:21] Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and
[56:25] thy house
[56:27] and what was so interesting because the
[56:29] scripture says believe on the Lord Jesus
[56:33] Christ but you know that's not what the
[56:35] script but that's not what the the uh
[56:38] the other translations
[56:40] say when it came out there he said well
[56:43] believe on believe on Jesus Christ and
[56:45] thou shalt be saved and I was like well
[56:48] that ain't what the Bible
[56:50] says and so you know I was I I brought
[56:52] that one because here they are you know
[56:54] they're want they're wanting a savior
[56:57] but they don't want a
[56:58] lord it's like well I'm saved well you
[57:02] know it's like well the problem is is
[57:04] people don't know what it means to be
[57:08] saved you know it's just like well well
[57:11] we're just we're just making the
[57:12] decision no when you realize that you're
[57:16] lost and when you're in a place that
[57:18] when you realize it comes down to a
[57:20] place where it's life or death when it
[57:25] comes to that place then you realize you
[57:26] know then you
[57:28] realize you come to a place God can do
[57:31] something for you brother BR says here
[57:34] in in Dr
[57:36] Moses he said when you he say when he
[57:39] talking about those that profess
[57:42] Christians he said but see that's the
[57:44] only way that you'll ever know what the
[57:46] real meaning of power and healing and
[57:48] salvation really means it is a spiritual
[57:50] revelation of the will and word of God
[57:53] you'll never learn it anywhere else only
[57:56] by
[57:57] Revelation when you realize where you
[57:59] where you came from and realize the
[58:01] condition that you're in God can do
[58:03] something for
[58:05] you I believe it was Moody that said God
[58:07] never turns us away empty unless we're
[58:10] full of
[58:11] ourselves but when you get to a place of
[58:13] full total
[58:15] surrender then God can do something for
[58:17] you and everybody's like well I I I want
[58:20] a savior but I don't want a lord well I
[58:23] want to make decisions for myself
[58:27] I I I saw a meme the other day and I
[58:29] don't know if any of y'all have seen it
[58:31] but it's but it's uh there's a there's a
[58:35] man and there's some sheep and there's
[58:37] there's this one sheep that's in the in
[58:38] the pasture and this man standing there
[58:41] and there's a ditch running in One
[58:43] Direction and then there's another one
[58:44] and it could be the same ditch might you
[58:46] just can't see it but you see one ditch
[58:48] right here in front and then you see
[58:50] another one going that this way across
[58:52] the pasture and it says you know how how
[58:54] how Christians are when we try to make
[58:57] our own decisions and do our own thing
[58:59] well here comes this sheep he's just
[59:00] running along having a great time and
[59:02] all of a sudden he falls right in this
[59:05] ditch well the man gets down there and
[59:07] you see him down there he's struggling
[59:09] working working working he finally gets
[59:11] the Sheep out of the ditch and gets him
[59:13] right up on the other side of the ditch
[59:15] on in the bank where that here he goes
[59:16] just takes off running just having a
[59:18] great time just just plowing through
[59:19] there and all of a sudden here's this
[59:21] other ditch next thing you know he goes
[59:23] Boop right in the other ditch
[59:27] and it's not that and he's not that far
[59:28] away from where he just come out of this
[59:30] ditch and he's right over there in
[59:31] another ditch and here's the same man
[59:33] he's got to go over there and get the
[59:35] Sheep out of the ditch
[59:37] again see that's the reason why we need
[59:41] we need a savior and a
[59:44] lord somebody got to come and get us out
[59:46] of the ditch but also we need someone to
[59:48] lead us we need a Shepherd to lead us
[59:51] because you know what because if we do
[59:52] the same thing lots of times we end up
[59:54] in the same place the same condition
[59:57] fighting the same battles that we've had
[1:00:00] before when the word has went forth to
[1:00:03] bring you to a place to deliver you from
[1:00:05] that and you go right back to
[1:00:09] it but see that's what God wants us to
[1:00:12] come
[1:00:16] to so we have to be surrendered to him
[1:00:23] amen see when you when you follow what
[1:00:26] God has for
[1:00:28] you I I'll be finishing here in a minute
[1:00:32] but brother Brown was
[1:00:34] speaking and he was talking about
[1:00:38] Moses and here's here's
[1:00:40] Moses you know God
[1:00:43] telling Moses there you know I've heard
[1:00:46] the Cry of my people by reason of their
[1:00:48] taskmasters and realizing the condition
[1:00:51] that the people are in and you know he
[1:00:53] he's he telling Moses you know Moses
[1:00:56] now's the time for you to be the deliver
[1:00:58] to break go down there and and pull
[1:01:00] these people bring them out this is the
[1:01:02] Fulfillment of the word and you know you
[1:01:04] know he's like well well I can't do this
[1:01:06] you know it makes all these excuses you
[1:01:07] know I can't speak and all these but you
[1:01:10] know God kept telling listen Moses
[1:01:12] you're the one this is your job you're
[1:01:15] the one to bring these people
[1:01:17] out because I'm come down but you're
[1:01:21] going to be my hands you're going to be
[1:01:22] my
[1:01:24] mouth all these all the things you're
[1:01:26] you're going to be the one that's going
[1:01:27] to do
[1:01:28] this and when you know when he goes down
[1:01:31] there and he begins to speak to the
[1:01:35] people you
[1:01:36] know all of his life he's had the
[1:01:39] greatest of the great he's had the
[1:01:41] lowest of
[1:01:42] lows here he is going through all of
[1:01:45] this don't know if he's going to get
[1:01:46] these people to believe him or not but
[1:01:48] God told him hey you're going to deliver
[1:01:50] these people brother Ram called him a
[1:01:52] oneman army oneman Invasion going down
[1:01:54] in there you know wife son on a donkey
[1:01:58] walking down through there greatest
[1:02:00] greatest military greatest army greatest

[1:02:03] down there where you going Moses I'm
[1:02:05] going to take
[1:02:08] over here he is going down there and you
[1:02:10] know he said you know the first thing he
[1:02:12] had to do when he began to tell them
[1:02:15] when it was time to
[1:02:17] leave and here here they are they
[1:02:19] they've seen they've seen the the the
[1:02:21] plagues and they've seen all the things
[1:02:23] that's taking place and he tells them
[1:02:25] listen you got to come take this this
[1:02:28] lamb and you got to roast it and you got
[1:02:30] to eat this lamb and you got to be

[1:02:52] had to go down
[1:02:53] there see and he said you got to go down
[1:02:55] there
[1:02:56] and sprinkle the blood on the
[1:03:01] door let me see if I I'm try here says
[1:03:05] Moses commissioned them to kill a lamb
[1:03:07] and to sprinkle it in the sign of the
[1:03:10] cross on the door and believer inside
[1:03:13] the door after sprinkling notice he said
[1:03:15] get the significance of the order of the
[1:03:17] scripture the believer once behind the
[1:03:19] blood could no more go out only through
[1:03:22] the approach had to go through the blood
[1:03:26] so here he is when when he begins to
[1:03:28] talk about see they had to put their
[1:03:31] themselves and believe so the first
[1:03:32] thing that they had to do is they had to
[1:03:34] believe what Moses
[1:03:36] said they had to believe that Moses
[1:03:38] Moses was the deliverer and what he said
[1:03:41] was true
[1:03:42] amen but you know they had seen they'
[1:03:45] seen the the water to blood they' seen
[1:03:47] all the all of the the things that taken
[1:03:50] place and here's this last thing you got
[1:03:52] to do you got to sell out and be ready
[1:03:55] to
[1:03:56] go and you got to put the blood on the
[1:03:58] door and you got to get everything ready
[1:04:01] and see when they done that they had to
[1:04:02] stand behind that
[1:04:05] blood here so they had to do exactly
[1:04:08] what said and the believer wants
[1:04:12] behind so you believe but then you got
[1:04:15] to do all these other
[1:04:16] things to get
[1:04:19] ready
[1:04:24] when said see if if they they didn't
[1:04:28] follow the sacrificial
[1:04:31] L it took it took this lamb where they
[1:04:34] didn't live because the death angel was
[1:04:35] passing through they were going to die
[1:04:39] but there was the one thing that they
[1:04:40] had to do and see they had to go through
[1:04:41] and they had to follow this and they had
[1:04:44] to get ready amen and eat that lamb he
[1:04:48] said because when the death angel passed
[1:04:49] through then they were
[1:04:51] leaving the death angel was there and
[1:04:54] he's like you know as the man was
[1:04:56] talking to his son was asking Daddy he
[1:04:58] said are you sure this is right well
[1:05:00] we're following what the word says we're
[1:05:03] following what the prophet said amen
[1:05:05] amen and so they had to follow exactly
[1:05:07] what he said so they had to follow the
[1:05:09] message that was given the word that was
[1:05:11] given him and they had to believe that
[1:05:13] that was the
[1:05:14] truth they had to believe what they
[1:05:16] heard was the truth then they had to
[1:05:19] follow what it said
[1:05:22] amen so when you follow what it said
[1:05:27] well
[1:05:28] then then if if you if you go up there
[1:05:31] and saywell I believe Moses is the
[1:05:33] prophet and I believe what he said and I
[1:05:35] believe I believe God sent him to
[1:05:36] deliver
[1:05:39] us well I I I just I just believe
[1:05:42] that but you know what the other thing
[1:05:44] they had to do is they had to follow
[1:05:48] what he saiden that's right the word
[1:05:50] came to them amen and they had to
[1:05:54] believe that and they had to do that
[1:05:58] am and they had so they were there and
[1:06:00] they had to follow that message not just
[1:06:03] believe it but they had to follow it
[1:06:05] they didn't get they didn't get to pick
[1:06:07] and choose what they want to do it was
[1:06:09] very it was very plain it was very
[1:06:12] detailed on what they were supposed to
[1:06:14] do there was there was there was
[1:06:17] no misunderstandings or anything in any
[1:06:20] of
[1:06:21] that if they wanted to be delivered amen
[1:06:24] and when they followed everything that
[1:06:25] God told them to do through Moses then
[1:06:29] guess what God brought them out right
[1:06:31] amen and it's the same way with you and
[1:06:34] I if we believe what God
[1:06:36] Said then we've got to do what he said
[1:06:39] to
[1:06:41] do and so if you if you you know if you
[1:06:44] want a if you want a savior you can't
[1:06:46] you can't have a savior without him
[1:06:48] being your Lord amen right amen you've
[1:06:51] got to realize that that he's going to
[1:06:53] be the one that's leading you to bring
[1:06:55] you through you just can't believe it
[1:06:57] because if you believe as as the first
[1:07:00] quote I read you know by my life would
[1:07:03] tell you if I believe or not right
[1:07:06] because the things that I
[1:07:07] do and then you'll see that then God
[1:07:10] will deliver you amen we see that we see
[1:07:13] the hour in which we live
[1:07:16] today and all the things going
[1:07:19] on you better be ready to go when he
[1:07:24] calls here I just want I want I want to
[1:07:25] read a few scriptures before I finish
[1:07:29] tonight but you know this this is one of
[1:07:31] the things that that come to me I
[1:07:32] started looking in the scripture you
[1:07:34] know there's so many times and the
[1:07:36] reason a reason I read 2 Samuel tonight
[1:07:39] because it's the first time the word
[1:07:40] savior is used in the Bible but it's the
[1:07:43] also the first portion of scripture
[1:07:46] that's the reason I read all three it's
[1:07:47] the first time you find the word in a in
[1:07:49] a portion of scripture where the word
[1:07:51] Lord is used but also the word savior is
[1:07:53] used because David says he's my Lord but
[1:07:56] he's also my
[1:07:59] savior but there's many scriptures and I
[1:08:01] just want to read a few of these Isaiah
[1:08:03] 4311 says I even I am the Lord and
[1:08:06] besides me there is no
[1:08:09] savior Thou shalt also suck the milk of
[1:08:12] the Gentiles and shall suck the breast
[1:08:13] of kings and thou shalt know that I am
[1:08:16] the Lord thy Savior and thy Redeemer the
[1:08:19] mighty one of Jacob amen Hosea 13:4 says
[1:08:24] yet I am the Lord thy God from the land
[1:08:26] of Egypt and thou shalt know no God but
[1:08:29] me for there is no savior besides me
[1:08:34] Luke 2:11 says For unto you is Born This
[1:08:37] Day in the city of David a savior which
[1:08:40] is Christ the lord am Philippians 3:20
[1:08:43] says for our conversation is in heaven
[1:08:46] from when also we look for the Savior
[1:08:49] the Lord Jesus Christ see there's so
[1:08:51] many times when you get when you start
[1:08:53] to look for that you know what say
[1:08:55] Savior and Lord Savior and Lord Paul and
[1:08:57] Apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:08:59] Commandment of God Our Savior and Lord
[1:09:01] Jesus Christ which is Our Hope amen yes
[1:09:07] so second Peter 21 says for an entrance
[1:09:10] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[1:09:12] into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[1:09:15] and Savior Jesus Christ he says for if
[1:09:19] if they for if after they have escaped
[1:09:23] the pollutions of the world through the
[1:09:24] knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:09:27] Christ they are again entangled therein
[1:09:30] and overcome the latter end is worth
[1:09:33] them than with then with them than the
[1:09:36] beginning in second Peter 3:18 says but
[1:09:39] grow in Grace and in the knowledge of
[1:09:41] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him
[1:09:44] be glory both now and forever amen God
[1:09:48] bless you how many wants him to be your
[1:09:50] lord and savior I want him to be my all
