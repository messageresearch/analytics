[27:35] done for
[27:39] strings are still on it so he's okay

[27:58] that's why sister willie if you don't
[27:59] mind handing them out please
[28:01] but it's good to have them with us today
[28:03] boy just that that's wonderful
[28:06] it's like brother bob black and now
[28:07] we're standing in the back
[28:10] brother rob said white guy white people
[28:12] can't do that
[28:14] white people just can't do that
[28:17] and it brings me back to that but you
[28:19] know what brother branham did that he he
[28:21] commented on the black people how they
[28:23] knew how their writ had rhythm and they
[28:25] were just happy-go-lucky family and they
[28:27] you know everything and that's the way
[28:28] you're supposed to be
[28:29] you know when we get out of our position
[28:31] is when we get all out of sorts with god
[28:34] but we stay in our position and and
[28:36] uh i believe they honor the gift that
[28:38] god's given amen
[28:40] and use it very well so
[28:42] good to see some really um uh
[28:44] good-looking young young men

[29:01] into
[29:02] into the uh maybe the summation of the
[29:04] statue of a perfect man
[29:06] and um if i'm a little bit long just
[29:09] forgive me
[29:10] but
[29:11] we're going to try to get finished today
[29:12] so that you can have your pastor back
[29:15] and uh
[29:16] he's he's fixing to dig into some deep
[29:18] stuff so i and it's not deep it's just
[29:20] it's simple
[29:21] the the more the word opens to you the
[29:23] more simple it should be
[29:25] it should be just
[29:27] if an illiterate person can understand
[29:28] the word of god
[29:30] you are to be able to understand the
[29:32] word of god it's just making yourself
[29:34] available for it all right make yourself
[29:37] available so let's turn back to ii peter
[29:40] 1
[29:41] and we're going to continue on there
[29:42] with the holy spirit right up to the
[29:45] capstone which is
[29:46] love or charity
[29:49] and

[30:10] the um announcements on the screen
[30:12] downstairs fellowship meeting brother
[30:14] matthew braille be with us
[30:16] and speaking for us there i think it's
[30:18] on the 20-something of march it's the
[30:19] week i get back from
[30:21] from the philippines so
[30:23] just pray for me and if you got a moment
[30:26] call june while i'm gone and just you
[30:28] know give her a few words
[30:30] of encouragement if she's at home
[30:41] we always joke somebody told her one
[30:43] time said i said
[30:45] don't you this is when i was going
[30:46] hunting a lot you know i'd be gone for a
[30:47] week or so and then they said don't you
[30:49] get tired of him going out and hunting
[30:51] and all this stuff and she said

[31:00] she's talking about my
[31:02] don't ruin my vacation

[31:18] lapses
[31:19] will be
[31:22] on all of us but
[31:25] it's the lord's work and we do i
[31:27] remember brother branham you know he'd
[31:29] be gone for months at a time
[31:31] that was hard but you know what he had a
[31:33] strong wife there to back him up so and
[31:36] he knew that
[31:37] um
[31:38] she was
[31:40] she was
[31:41] i believe she was as great as he was she
[31:43] just couldn't preach
[31:44] because she kept him from the people she
[31:46] kept his clothes washed he did all the
[31:48] things for him god calls a man he
[31:50] absolutely calls the woman
[31:52] or the wife to go with him but second

[33:12] all right simon peter a servant apostle
[33:13] of jesus christ to them that have
[33:15] obtained light precious faith what we're
[33:17] talking about this morning with us
[33:19] through the righteousness of god and our
[33:21] savior jesus christ grace and peace be
[33:23] multiplied unto you through the
[33:24] knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
[33:27] according as his divine power there's
[33:29] nothing divine except god so it's got to
[33:31] be talking about the power of god
[33:33] divine power hath given unto us all
[33:35] things that pertain unto life and
[33:37] godliness through the knowledge of him
[33:39] that has called us to glory and virtue
[33:41] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[33:43] great and precious promises that by
[33:45] these you might be partakers of the
[33:47] divine nature so you're going to go into
[33:48] something and partake all right it's
[33:51] good to have a restaurant with some good
[33:52] food right
[33:54] you can read the reviews you can listen
[33:57] to the neighbors you can listen to the
[33:59] people it's been
[34:02] but until you go
[34:05] until you go and partake
[34:07] you don't know what it's about all right
[34:09] it's just hearsay same thing with the
[34:11] divine nature of god it's just hearsay
[34:13] unless you partake of that divine nature
[34:16] having escaped the corruption that is in
[34:18] the world through lust and besides this
[34:20] in other words besides all this divine
[34:22] nature of god giving all diligence add
[34:24] to your faith virtue and divert your
[34:26] knowledge into knowledge temperance and
[34:27] the temperance patience and the patience
[34:29] godliness
[34:30] and the godliness brotherly kindness and
[34:32] brother kindness
[34:33] charity for if these things be in you
[34:35] and abound they make you that you shall
[34:38] neither be barren or unfruitful in the
[34:39] knowledge of our lord jesus christ but
[34:41] he that lacketh these things is blind
[34:44] and cannot see afar off and have
[34:45] forgotten that he was purged from his
[34:47] old sins
[34:48] wherefore the rather brethren give
[34:49] diligence i like that word diligence
[34:51] diligence to make your calling and
[34:53] election
[34:54] sure
[34:56] for if ye do these things
[34:58] you shall never
[35:00] fall lord has blessed unto the reading
[35:02] of the word you may be seated
[35:04] then we were talking about this morning
[35:05] there is where
[35:07] that peter's telling us what to do
[35:09] and then now in ephesians 4 verse 11
[35:12] through 13
[35:13] paul is telling us how to get it all
[35:16] right and he gave some apostles some
[35:17] prophets some evangelists and some
[35:19] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[35:21] of the saints for the work of the
[35:22] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[35:24] christ till we all come to the unity of
[35:27] the faith and to the knowledge of the
[35:28] son of god unto a perfect man and to the
[35:31] measure of the stature
[35:33] of the fullness of christ so everybody
[35:35] he's got that i thank them pretty pat
[35:37] and let's go to the first quote that
[35:39] we're going to read i told you we're
[35:40] going to read it every time
[35:42] brother branham said in a statue of a
[35:43] perfect man says notice
[35:44] you must be born again and when you're
[35:47] born again you can't be born again
[35:49] without having faith
[35:50] that's right so you see on my chart here
[35:52] i got the very foundation look it's real
[35:55] wide faith is the foundation so it's
[35:57] going to carry you all the way up it's
[35:59] wonderful to have a foundation but you
[36:01] got to build a building on that
[36:02] foundation all right or it just sits
[36:05] there as a foundation and that's not
[36:06] true with god because remember god had a
[36:08] plan and a purpose his plan was was to
[36:11] see a group of people that would come to
[36:13] this full stature all right so
[36:15] somebody's going to do it i i told them
[36:18] last weekend i'm just dumb enough to
[36:19] believe it's me
[36:29] first time
[36:30] all right roll it on up
[36:32] you either have faith or doubt you're
[36:34] either possessed one you're possessed of
[36:37] one that dominates your life you see
[36:38] that dominates
[36:40] all right
[36:41] in other words has the preeminence in
[36:43] your life you either have one that's you
[36:45] have the preeminence of god or
[36:47] preeminence of the devil you can't be in
[36:48] between you've got one or the other all
[36:51] right there's no gray area just depends
[36:54] on how much faith you have how high
[36:57] you can rise everybody agree with that
[37:00] say amen
[37:01] all right so what we're going to do
[37:03] today is is we've come up through faith
[37:05] virtue knowledge temperance if you want
[37:07] to put that chart up
[37:09] that we were that we were doing i i want
[37:11] to
[37:12] i'm not changing the profit right
[37:14] i'm not changing what the profit taught
[37:17] right
[37:18] all right look you know i don't believe
[37:20] i am either but watch
[37:22] we're going to substitute this
[37:24] thank you turn that fire off
[37:30] yeah not too off well you need to sit
[37:31] closer sister game
[37:34] bless your heart
[37:35] she gets cold
[37:36] she gets cold
[37:38] look right here look down here at the
[37:40] bottom it's faith right
[37:42] that's believing but that's your earnest
[37:46] that's your earnest that's your down
[37:48] payment to the full inheritance all
[37:51] right so there's your earnest is down
[37:53] here now then we talked about virtue
[37:56] being strong faith right
[37:58] right discerning faith is the next one
[38:00] knowledge
[38:02] temperance is control faith
[38:04] then enduring faith patience and then
[38:07] respecting faith what respecting the
[38:09] gifts of god in godliness and then
[38:11] common faith
[38:12] is what everything common everything the
[38:15] same
[38:16] god listen there's one thing about god
[38:18] he's consistent
[38:20] you and i forget it but god is
[38:23] consistent so what he said that's the
[38:25] way it's going to be
[38:26] all right then we we got into this this
[38:29] morning and we'll look at it as to me
[38:32] that's the binding this is the holy
[38:34] spirit here is the binding
[38:36] or the welding that welds all this
[38:39] together
[38:40] all right so everybody all right with
[38:42] that is that okay all right and then we
[38:44] see agape love which is the love of god
[38:47] not the love of man has nothing to do
[38:49] listen it has nothing to do with your
[38:51] emotions or your feelings
[38:54] that all right
[38:55] because you remember your emotions and
[38:57] feelings are contrary to god to start
[38:59] with
[39:00] what this is doing is this is what is
[39:03] transforming you
[39:05] by the mind of god coming into you it's
[39:08] transforming you from what from just a
[39:10] human to a superhuman
[39:12] all right from natural to supernatural
[39:15] all right so we got the binding agape
[39:17] love now look see that's your full
[39:18] inheritance you see that
[39:20] and then we have the headstone of the
[39:21] capstone and that's what we're going to
[39:23] talk about today is finish a little bit
[39:25] here with the holy spirit and then get
[39:28] into what we really been wanting to get
[39:29] into now we've been talking before and i
[39:32] want you to realize
[39:34] that
[39:35] all those scriptures that we read it
[39:37] talks about the son of god
[39:40] all right now who is the son of god
[39:42] the son of god is the creator the one
[39:44] that created the world not not not the
[39:47] one two thousand years ago
[39:49] but it's the same person but when you
[39:50] say son of god that's the creator that's
[39:53] why they could look at jesus and say you
[39:56] created all things that was the son of
[39:58] god inside that man creating all things
[40:00] right so that was the creator
[40:04] excuse me
[40:05] but the son of god revelation down
[40:08] through seven church ages only puts you
[40:11] in the body and then it also puts you in
[40:14] service but it never brought the full
[40:16] inheritance
[40:18] amen
[40:19] because remember the earnest or the down
[40:21] payment when you buy a house the earnest
[40:24] is very important
[40:26] it's really the most important it's the
[40:28] first thing you do right but you still
[40:30] have to make payments
[40:33] you still have to make payments
[40:36] until you actually get that title deed
[40:39] in your hand
[40:41] because it's not yours until you do
[40:43] all right it's somebody else's until you
[40:45] do
[40:46] but now remember
[40:48] i'm not going to get into that but
[40:49] remember there's one closer to you
[40:55] than god
[40:57] you have a closer kinsman that's right
[41:00] sorry
[41:01] it's the devil
[41:03] remember boaz and ruth boaz had to go to
[41:06] the nearer kinsmen
[41:08] because remember
[41:10] satan has
[41:11] satan has
[41:13] one strike and it's this thing right
[41:15] here
[41:16] amen
[41:17] but what we're doing with this this is
[41:19] an inside work going outward amen this
[41:22] is all inside it's a secret to me this
[41:25] is the greatest secret that god ever had
[41:28] on the face of the earth outside of
[41:29] jesus christ
[41:31] is that he can live in me and you in
[41:33] satan's eden and have all these things
[41:35] working in our life and us absolutely be
[41:38] sons and daughters of god
[41:40] and the world don't even know we're here
[41:45] the world don't even know we're here
[41:47] and you know what 90 of them don't care
[41:54] but we're the only thing that's holding
[41:56] this thing
[41:58] together you think all the president and
[42:01] all of this and all of that
[42:03] baloney
[42:07] it's all gone people
[42:09] you and i are the reason california is
[42:11] not in the ground
[42:13] you and i are the reason that the bombs
[42:15] haven't already fell on the united
[42:17] states
[42:18] so don't think don't think you're not so
[42:21] important
[42:23] we're the key to this whole thing
[42:25] but it's a secret
[42:27] well you think they're going to put in
[42:28] the paper that when you come to
[42:29] knowledge that oh sister johnny come to
[42:31] knowledge we're gonna put it in the um
[42:34] wherever you live
[42:35] in
[42:36] covington or wherever you live down
[42:38] there they're gonna put it in the paper
[42:39] assistant johnny made it to knowledge no
[42:40] they don't the world don't care
[42:43] the world don't care
[42:45] what we've got to do is though is we've
[42:47] got to come to the full stature of
[42:49] christ
[42:51] and then let him do the work
[42:54] because we're not going to go to the
[42:55] white house and do anything we're not
[42:57] going to go to this place in that place
[42:58] the greatest place to be standing today
[43:00] is like the brother says right here
[43:03] amen right here is the greatest place to
[43:06] be because right here is where you can
[43:09] make a difference
[43:11] he said while i'll go make a yeah you
[43:14] can make a difference out there but the
[43:15] greatest difference is you
[43:18] all right the greatest difference is you
[43:19] god wants to what he wants to bring this
[43:23] alive
[43:25] in a group of people
[43:27] not
[43:29] listen
[43:30] dead people can't help us
[43:36] live their life
[43:37] done and finished right
[43:40] we don't believe in the communion of
[43:42] saints
[43:44] we're not catholic
[43:46] no it says to the sanctified the saints
[43:49] this is what he's talking to live people
[43:51] so you and this is to a live group of
[43:53] people because they're depending on us
[43:55] to get them out of the ground amen
[43:58] they without us cannot be made what
[44:00] perfect
[44:01] because they came up through these
[44:02] church ages they were perfect in their
[44:05] soul
[44:06] you can't have an imperfect soul and be
[44:08] and have god in your soul okay
[44:10] all right but what happens is like we
[44:12] said this morning there was that doors
[44:14] indoors they had a place to wear number
[44:16] one i don't believe it was talk you've
[44:18] got to hear the word
[44:20] you got to hear the word and then let it
[44:22] be quickened in your life
[44:26] you got to hear it
[44:27] so you got to make yourself available
[44:29] for it
[44:30] see because luther luther was born again
[44:33] under justification he could smoke a
[44:36] pipe and drink beer
[44:38] and he's okay
[44:40] but now that justification
[44:43] you can still die and go to hell in this
[44:45] age do you understand that
[44:47] right
[44:49] sure justification is part of your
[44:50] journey amen we believe that this church
[44:53] you go through three stages of
[44:55] justification sanctification the baptism
[44:57] of the holy ghost to get the new birth
[44:59] amen we don't do away with that brother
[45:00] brown never did away with it and we're
[45:02] not either but god has called us to come
[45:04] higher that if we do smoke a pipe and we
[45:06] do drink a beer we're lost
[45:10] you are lost
[45:12] but god's made provision to come up
[45:14] higher what happened was god moved
[45:15] through luther and the lutherans stopped
[45:19] they put a wall of petition
[45:22] and said you got to do this and do that
[45:24] god moved on through wesley same thing
[45:26] then pentecost and then right on up to
[45:28] you and i and there's nothing else left
[45:30] but us going home and man there's not
[45:32] another church age there's not another
[45:34] messenger there's not another message
[45:37] we've got to get this message right
[45:38] first
[45:40] all right so we come up excuse me
[45:42] we come up to the holy spirit
[45:44] and we read there in ephesians we won't
[45:47] read that one again brother um
[45:49] bob if you want to skip over that one
[45:52] we will go remember we read
[45:55] ephesians 4 let's
[45:58] we stopped right here
[46:00] go go to the next one
[46:04] where it says holy spirit where we
[46:06] stopped at
[46:08] for this morning he's back there he's
[46:09] fell off his chair
[46:14] let's read quote four how about going to
[46:16] quote four can you do that
[46:17] everybody got one of these
[46:19] okay that that's what we're going to be
[46:21] talking about this is a full stature see
[46:23] we read that this morning all right
[46:25] because remember the body is joined
[46:27] fitly together now let's read what
[46:29] brother brown said right here
[46:31] now what does it do then you're waiting
[46:33] for the headstone which is love all
[46:35] right for god is love and he controls
[46:36] and he's the strength of every one of
[46:38] these things that's right yes sir right
[46:40] in here right in here you see i got
[46:42] between all these works in here and here
[46:44] these little waves come what is that the
[46:46] holy ghost coming down through christ
[46:48] see holy spirit the holy spirit is above
[46:50] all this welding this together building
[46:52] a what a perfect
[46:54] church so we can be perfect amen for the
[46:58] capstone to cap it off and like we were
[47:00] talking about this morning
[47:02] this doesn't come down here
[47:06] we what we grow up in god
[47:08] because you see here
[47:10] you know the the funny statement always
[47:12] is you know i'm the head and the neck
[47:14] turns me
[47:15] no the neck can't do anything without
[47:17] the head telling it first
[47:20] you can't turn your head without your
[47:22] brain telling your head to turn all
[47:24] right we made little silly things about
[47:26] your wife being the neck and you'd be in
[47:27] the head and she turned your head but
[47:29] that's kind of that's just silliness
[47:32] but look how would god be though in this
[47:35] drawing how would god be brother dick
[47:37] without that
[47:39] the head and the body can't unite
[47:42] amen so there's got to be a neck there
[47:46] that everything you know everything that
[47:47] happens to your body goes through your
[47:48] neck
[47:51] everything that happens goes right
[47:52] through your neck there's a there's a
[47:54] there's a pipe that goes down
[47:56] and that's called your neck
[47:58] right
[47:58] so that's the same thing with the holy
[48:00] spirit god has to come down through that
[48:04] to make all these things work amen
[48:07] everybody got that say amen
[48:09] so that's the binding that's where
[48:11] everything has to go because you can't
[48:12] think this and it go around and come to
[48:15] your foot now it's got to come down
[48:17] through here through the neck part which
[48:20] is what the binding or the welding part
[48:22] without your neck
[48:24] connected to your body
[48:27] remember
[48:29] you can have your spine severed your
[48:31] brain will work
[48:33] but if your spine severed up here your
[48:34] body's not gonna work because it has to
[48:37] go down through the neck all right so
[48:39] the neck of this whole thing is the holy
[48:40] spirit and it's christ doing what
[48:43] showing what brother branham said now we
[48:45] said today this morning that it was a
[48:47] pull and what it is it's pulling up
[48:50] to fill in this part right here
[48:53] all right
[48:54] because if you bring this down here it
[48:56] won't fit
[48:58] huh you got that
[49:00] got to be the holy spirit filling this
[49:03] in
[49:04] to make that building complete and
[49:06] brother brown and we if we get to it
[49:08] brother brown said there's a flange
[49:11] there's a little piece that fits right
[49:13] over here to shed the water
[49:15] because you know what if there i promise
[49:17] you if there's a hole in your roof
[49:19] and it leaks guess what's going to
[49:21] happen that's where the water's going to
[49:23] come through right everybody's had a
[49:25] leaky roof sometime or another or leaky
[49:27] something and wherever there's a crack
[49:30] wherever there's a gap
[49:31] that's where the water is going to come
[49:33] through all right so that's the same
[49:34] thing in god if we don't have that
[49:36] binding or that welding together as the
[49:39] prophet of god said there in in that
[49:41] fourth
[49:42] part here the glory the power of god
[49:43] coming down through this what
[49:45] welding it together
[49:48] see he's talking about pentecost he's
[49:50] talking about lutherans talking about
[49:51] the wesleyans but there's a genuine part
[49:53] of it now see that doesn't make them
[49:55] wrong
[49:59] martin luther was not wrong
[50:01] martin luther was right the doctrine
[50:03] martin luther priest was correct god god
[50:06] said that's fine but there's more
[50:08] amen but the lutheran said that's fine
[50:11] and we don't need it anymore
[50:13] the lutheran the doctrine the lutheran
[50:15] denomination
[50:17] they stood where they were and they died
[50:19] god moved on all right same thing with
[50:22] you and i we can sit in a message church
[50:24] and just die
[50:26] we can just die if you think this is
[50:28] just something you need to come to
[50:29] church just because if you don't
[50:30] somebody will talk about you number one
[50:32] you are true
[50:34] number two
[50:37] this is where i get my i get filled up
[50:40] right here
[50:42] this is where i get filled up is in
[50:43] right here all right
[50:46] now let's go to paragraph 341 uh roll it
[50:49] up and we'll
[50:50] 341.
[50:52] these fellas wasn't required luther was
[50:54] not required to go into ii peter and
[50:58] preach this
[50:59] right even though he may have read it he
[51:01] may have even
[51:03] had a sermon on it but there was no way
[51:06] he could attain to that
[51:09] because he was under the just shall live
[51:11] by faith
[51:12] but you and i
[51:15] the seals have been open the book has
[51:17] been open
[51:18] all right so we should be able to
[51:19] understand these things the holy ghost
[51:22] christ and the person of the holy ghost
[51:24] this is what we read when we finish this
[51:26] morning comes upon you so there's a this
[51:29] is an anointing
[51:31] this is a feeling
[51:34] everybody okay with that say amen
[51:36] this is a feeling god fills you with his
[51:40] soul
[51:42] his soul
[51:44] fills you with his soul then you grow up
[51:46] through here and then what does he do he
[51:48] anoints that whole thing
[51:51] amen
[51:53] it's an anointing same holy ghost
[51:56] remember there's different anointings
[51:58] same holy ghost but this is a special
[52:01] anointing this anointing brings us from
[52:04] the son of god ministry
[52:07] because remember
[52:10] the son of man is the one that was
[52:11] adopted
[52:13] the son of god don't need adoption
[52:16] he's the creator he's the one that
[52:18] created all things
[52:20] the son of god created all things
[52:22] brother dale's going through it so it's
[52:23] wonderful how they fit together
[52:25] but the son of man is the one that took
[52:27] a body change the son of man is the one
[52:30] that was adopted so we must get into the
[52:32] that's why brother brown had to bring
[52:34] the son of man ministry he had to bring
[52:35] us out of the son of god ministry to
[52:37] bring us into the son of man ministry so
[52:39] we could understand that we're to become
[52:42] the word made flesh
[52:46] the holy ghost christ in the person of
[52:47] the holy ghost comes upon you in the
[52:49] true baptism of the holy ghost not that
[52:51] it was false
[52:55] but it's just going to ring more true
[52:56] than it ever has before
[52:59] listen because there's nobody on the
[53:00] face of this earth had it like jesus had
[53:02] it
[53:03] he was the fullness of the godhead
[53:05] bodily right
[53:07] now you and i are not the fullness but
[53:09] all together we are the fullness
[53:11] we weren't on the earth
[53:14] when jesus was here
[53:16] most of us wasn't here when brother
[53:17] branham was here we've all been born
[53:19] after or or come in after so we weren't
[53:22] here he was preaching to a group of
[53:24] people
[53:25] that wasn't even born
[53:28] you're going to understand that one day
[53:32] when brother branham gets up on the
[53:33] seals and he said this is not for you
[53:36] it's gone from you
[53:38] he's telling the people look you're
[53:40] under the son of god dispensation
[53:43] live a good christian life do what
[53:45] you're supposed to do and if he could
[53:47] say it he would he said because you're
[53:48] going to die and go by the grave
[53:51] because you're not getting this but
[53:53] there's a group of people that's coming
[53:54] hallelujah there's a group of people
[53:57] that's not coming that's here
[53:59] that's going to take this thing and
[54:01] sweep it right on up to the coming of
[54:02] the lord because we got to have adopted
[54:05] sons and daughters of god before we get
[54:07] a body change
[54:08] that's why this is important people
[54:12] you can stay right here and you can die
[54:13] all you want to
[54:15] i may fall dead in 15 seconds but
[54:17] somebody's going to reach that right
[54:18] there and death will not have a victory
[54:22] over them
[54:24] the holy ghost christ and the person of
[54:26] the holy ghost
[54:27] comes upon you in the true baptism of
[54:29] the holy ghost and you've got all these
[54:31] virtues sealed in you
[54:35] then god lives in the tabernacle called
[54:38] the building the living now he's not
[54:39] talking about a building
[54:41] he's all about a building
[54:44] right not made by hands
[54:46] listen if you're born again
[54:48] you weren't made by hands
[54:50] that's why i said about that seed adam
[54:52] and eve got together and produced a son
[54:56] made by hands
[54:58] made by two people
[55:01] listen you and i are born by the word of
[55:03] god
[55:04] no sex involved it's all right here the
[55:07] way we should have come we're going to
[55:09] talk about it lord if we get to it we're
[55:11] going to talk about because remember
[55:13] adam
[55:15] adam before the fall didn't need
[55:17] redemption
[55:18] now in the mind of god he knew
[55:19] everything's going to happen but
[55:20] remember when adam was in a certain
[55:22] place
[55:23] they were perfect right
[55:26] he was the god of the earth
[55:29] but when it fell
[55:32] when it fell
[55:33] right right
[55:35] for us to go back to where we have we're
[55:37] we're living in human bodies without
[55:39] death we got to come back to here that's
[55:42] right
[55:43] and they really enjoyed daddy brother
[55:45] brother joe greene's cause he'd never
[55:46] seen it like that before remember
[55:48] redemption is not replacement
[55:51] all right so you don't drop this and
[55:53] pick up a pencil but now remember here's
[55:55] what man's done man said okay there is
[55:58] redemption
[55:59] it's fail now i'm going to pick it up
[56:02] and put my idea with it
[56:06] now is that where it started
[56:08] where it started was here
[56:10] that's why it took a profit to type the
[56:12] loose ends man's had it over here man
[56:14] it's called redemption father son holy
[56:16] ghost baptism three gods and all these
[56:17] different things but you've got to bring
[56:19] it back to where it was restore it back
[56:22] to the position remember brother branham
[56:23] said one time he said i remember he
[56:25] talked about the vision
[56:27] about the hat
[56:28] that's right
[56:29] the hat didn't just it wasn't just that
[56:32] the hat was there or in the room it had
[56:34] to be in the right place
[56:36] before anything could happen he said i
[56:38] saw the hat laying there he said but i
[56:40] couldn't do anything about it
[56:42] he said i had to wait till they moved
[56:44] that hat
[56:46] for the vision
[56:47] come on vision god's got a vision he's
[56:50] got a vision of me and you
[56:53] all right stop preaching
[56:56] all right
[56:59] but look that's what we got to come back
[57:00] to right there
[57:02] all right we got to come back to here
[57:04] god lives in a tabernacle called the
[57:06] building
[57:07] the living tabernacle live in god's
[57:09] dwelling place and when a man possesses
[57:11] these kind of things then the holy ghost
[57:13] comes upon him no matter you might speak
[57:15] with tongues impersonate any gift that
[57:17] god's got remember brother brown said
[57:19] the third poll will not be impersonated
[57:22] because remember i i don't have the
[57:24] quote but i read it the other day
[57:25] brother brown said the branham
[57:27] tabernacle i think is black feminist
[57:28] names brother brown said the the
[57:30] reason brown tabernacle is not growing
[57:33] he said you've got two kinds of virtue
[57:37] one was just normal virtue and the other
[57:39] one's holy ghost version see you can
[57:41] have a part of these virtues
[57:44] and not be born again
[57:46] but you can't come to right here
[57:50] and have those virtues
[57:52] just be natural born virtues no
[57:56] no matter you might speak with tongues
[57:57] you might impersonate any gift that god
[57:59] has got you might do that but until
[58:01] these virtues here go into you
[58:04] you're still off the real true
[58:06] foundation of faith
[58:08] but when these virtues grow in and you
[58:10] added that to that then you are a living
[58:13] monument you are a living moving
[58:16] idol come on amen
[58:18] a living
[58:20] moving idol you're not one
[58:23] that just stands there that's the statue
[58:25] we've become statues
[58:28] not stature we've become statues
[58:32] even maybe in our christian walk maybe
[58:33] we'd
[58:34] we need to kind of uh
[58:36] shake ourselves a little bit because god
[58:38] doesn't want statues
[58:40] the catholic church has statues
[58:43] no we got a living god
[58:45] we got a god that's got skin on it
[58:48] yes sir amen
[58:50] we got a god that's got skin on it
[58:54] you know the reason
[58:56] i is telling them they're in in north
[58:58] carolina the reason i know that i'm
[59:01] going to live in human flesh
[59:04] i'm going to being a glorified by living
[59:06] human flesh and god himself is going to
[59:08] live in human flesh and he's going to be
[59:10] right there with us it's because
[59:14] adam talked with god
[59:18] before the fall
[59:21] he was in a human body that brother
[59:22] branham would have been said would have
[59:23] been made eternal right
[59:25] had there not been a fall
[59:27] so that's what we got to go back listen
[59:29] redemption is not replacement you got to
[59:30] go back to there all right so we got to
[59:33] what what are we missing in this whole
[59:35] thing we're missing authority
[59:39] we're missing authority
[59:42] all of us we're all missing authority
[59:44] god has given us authority we just
[59:46] haven't reached out and got it yet
[59:49] we just haven't reached out and got it
[59:50] yet
[59:53] that's right well you got to be bold you
[59:54] got you got to know that you're that
[59:56] this thing right that this holy spirit
[59:58] has welded that thing together to when
[1:00:00] god that when satan does give you that
[1:00:02] punch
[1:00:05] your building is not going to crack
[1:00:08] your building's not going to crack when
[1:00:09] he gives you that punch
[1:00:11] and you got to what have what f
[1:00:14] a
[1:00:15] i t 8.
[1:00:16] you got to have faith
[1:00:18] and you know in god
[1:00:21] all right now look number five
[1:00:23] let's read a few of these and then we'll
[1:00:25] get
[1:00:26] look let's just read the blue you're a
[1:00:27] living instrumentality of god god
[1:00:30] walking on what
[1:00:32] two feet in you amen
[1:00:35] glory the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:00:37] ordered of god god walking in you
[1:00:40] for ye are written epistles read of all
[1:00:44] men
[1:00:45] and if the life that's in christ being
[1:00:47] you you'll bear the life that christ
[1:00:49] bore
[1:00:50] all right let's go to number six
[1:00:51] blasphemous names brother brown said now
[1:00:54] these things here absolutely must be
[1:00:57] look must be in the christian before the
[1:01:00] holy ghost ever seals them
[1:01:03] before this comes down on top and makes
[1:01:06] a white complete
[1:01:08] unit all right number seven i picked
[1:01:10] some of these out so we could
[1:01:12] we could hurry through them i don't want
[1:01:14] to hurry through them but we're going to
[1:01:15] have to
[1:01:16] the holy spirit always speaks of what
[1:01:18] the word
[1:01:19] so you're supposed to be all the way up
[1:01:21] here by that time say bring us into the
[1:01:24] full stature of sons and daughters of
[1:01:26] god now we're going to read it in a
[1:01:27] little while you're a son here
[1:01:31] you're an heir
[1:01:33] but you know what
[1:01:35] you got to possess that you got to you
[1:01:36] know what if you have a reading of a
[1:01:38] will
[1:01:40] you got to be there and you know what
[1:01:42] you got to do you got to accept it
[1:01:45] you got to accept that
[1:01:48] all right
[1:01:51] let's go to number eight
[1:01:57] blasphemous names
[1:02:01] he's talking about mental faith and this
[1:02:02] is where he was talking about the uh the
[1:02:04] brown tabernacle because most of your
[1:02:06] faith is mental faith
[1:02:09] but it's gotta drop down to be what
[1:02:10] become a spiritual revelation all right
[1:02:12] your mental faith right here comes the
[1:02:14] holy spirit coming down into your mental
[1:02:16] faith making it a spiritual faith then
[1:02:18] the spiritual faith only recognizes the
[1:02:20] word now and number two three then
[1:02:23] you'll have spiritual you'll be have the
[1:02:25] holy spirit and will seal all these
[1:02:28] things into you as that holy spirit
[1:02:31] covers this
[1:02:32] from your faith up to the holy spirit
[1:02:34] now what's he talking about from your
[1:02:36] faith
[1:02:37] up to the holy spirit that's what he's
[1:02:39] talking about right because see when
[1:02:40] he's preached blasphemous names i'm
[1:02:42] pretty sure the chart was still up there
[1:02:44] because he was referring to it okay
[1:02:46] all right from your faith up to the holy
[1:02:48] spirit seals you in with christ then you
[1:02:51] become one
[1:02:53] right something that god can
[1:02:56] use right all right let's read paragraph
[1:02:58] 152 and then they are vindicated in what
[1:03:02] place
[1:03:03] that's what we're fixing to talk about
[1:03:05] you can be vindicated but you're going
[1:03:06] to have to be placed all right when that
[1:03:09] time takes place they become vindicated
[1:03:12] sons and daughters of god
[1:03:13] amen that's what we want to be we just
[1:03:15] don't want to be sons and daughters of
[1:03:16] god we want to be vindicated sons and
[1:03:19] daughters of god amen
[1:03:21] and you know what like i said before it
[1:03:22] doesn't make your head swell
[1:03:24] if it makes you puffed up then you know
[1:03:26] who's puffing you up
[1:03:28] it's not god amen
[1:03:31] god gives you a revelation truly gives
[1:03:34] you a revelation
[1:03:35] first thing you say is why me lord why
[1:03:37] why me why why did you pick me to do
[1:03:39] this well you know what he's got to work
[1:03:41] for you to do accept it
[1:03:44] accept it that's what i said before if
[1:03:46] god shows you that you got this kind of
[1:03:48] holy ghost patience thank god that he
[1:03:51] had enough
[1:03:53] confidence in you
[1:03:55] to give it to you
[1:03:57] because he knew you would use it right
[1:03:59] he's not gonna he's not like me and you
[1:04:01] that that you know i'll give i'll give
[1:04:03] sister milk or something i'll say well
[1:04:06] maybe she'll use it maybe she won't
[1:04:08] no god knows what she's gonna do with it
[1:04:10] before he even gives it to her all right
[1:04:13] so the same thing with you and i as we
[1:04:14] go up this statue of a perfect man what
[1:04:16] a great confirmation that that can be of
[1:04:20] you being a son and daughter of god is
[1:04:22] that what he tries you
[1:04:24] and i right he tries you remember
[1:04:26] patience tribulation work is patience so
[1:04:29] you're going to go through some
[1:04:30] tribulation i promise you that
[1:04:32] because tribulation work is patience
[1:04:35] all right so everybody okay the holy
[1:04:37] spirit is an anointing on all this
[1:04:40] it seals you in
[1:04:42] now sure you're in the body of christ
[1:04:44] here but right here god is fixing to do
[1:04:46] something to you that he has done
[1:04:49] to hardly any people in the world
[1:04:53] because we're fixing to talk about
[1:04:54] something that the lord jesus and
[1:04:56] william branham went through that we
[1:04:58] know that's vindicated now we know of
[1:04:59] others
[1:05:00] but we know of those two that's
[1:05:02] documented vindicated that they were
[1:05:05] taken upon a place and god said this is
[1:05:08] my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to
[1:05:09] dwell hear ye him
[1:05:12] all right see because what happens right
[1:05:14] down here right down here god says this
[1:05:16] is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to
[1:05:18] dwell he's pleased to dwell in you
[1:05:20] at that point but he doesn't say hear ye
[1:05:23] him
[1:05:25] because you know what
[1:05:27] honestly
[1:05:28] he knows what you're going to say
[1:05:30] and it may not be right
[1:05:37] that's what it is
[1:05:39] we're all a bunch of legalists when we
[1:05:40] start
[1:05:41] right
[1:05:44] we still in the do's and don'ts
[1:05:47] hey man so now let's go to charity love
[1:05:49] or the headstone
[1:05:51] all right let's go to first corinthians
[1:05:53] 13. now what we're doing is
[1:05:55] if we know then that only maybe a tenth
[1:05:58] of a of a percent has ever reached this
[1:06:01] that
[1:06:02] we know one thing's for sure
[1:06:06] once you reach that
[1:06:08] you're gonna have to have the same
[1:06:11] the same you've got to have the same
[1:06:13] anointing that jesus had and brother
[1:06:16] branham had you've got to have the same
[1:06:18] revelation
[1:06:20] boy yeah you've got to have the same
[1:06:22] revelation brother brother harris i
[1:06:23] never forgot that years ago he preached
[1:06:26] on the sword in the hand you've got to
[1:06:27] have a sword in the hand experience for
[1:06:29] your own self
[1:06:30] why because the words go out to fit you
[1:06:32] it does mean no good that it fit william
[1:06:34] branham
[1:06:36] other than i can what draw virtue off of
[1:06:38] what he preached
[1:06:40] but still
[1:06:42] i gotta have it just like he had it
[1:06:44] exactly there's only one thing between
[1:06:46] me and brother branham he had a gift he
[1:06:48] was a prophet i'm not a prophet
[1:06:50] but i can receive what from a prophet
[1:06:52] the bible even says if you'll honor a
[1:06:54] prophet you'll get a what
[1:06:56] prophet's reward
[1:06:58] now you and i are going to get a
[1:06:59] prophet's reward because he was adopted
[1:07:02] so you and i if you enter into the same
[1:07:05] place
[1:07:06] and not say i got it because he got it
[1:07:09] i got it because the pastor got it i got
[1:07:12] it because my wife got it no you got to
[1:07:15] have a
[1:07:16] sword in the hand experience for your
[1:07:18] own self god's going to have to take you
[1:07:20] out somewhere put you out put you up on
[1:07:23] him put you up on a pedestal
[1:07:25] him put you up on a pedestal and say
[1:07:27] that's my son if you're going to get
[1:07:29] anything from him you're going to have
[1:07:30] to listen to him
[1:07:34] he got quiet
[1:07:36] right
[1:07:37] we're living way below our privileges
[1:07:40] brother branham called us little messiah
[1:07:42] so we're going to read in just a minute
[1:07:44] how that god has purposed
[1:07:46] that all that come to pass so charity
[1:07:48] love the headstone first corinthians 13
[1:07:50] verse 1 though i speak with tongue of
[1:07:52] men and angels and have not what charity
[1:07:55] that charity is love
[1:07:58] that's agape love that is not filial
[1:08:00] love all right
[1:08:01] i am become as a sounding brass and a
[1:08:03] tinkling or a tinkling symbol and though
[1:08:05] i have the gift of prophecy
[1:08:07] and understand all mysteries and all
[1:08:11] knowledge though i have all faith
[1:08:14] so that i could remove mountains and
[1:08:16] have not charity i am nothing
[1:08:21] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[1:08:23] the poor and though i give my body to be
[1:08:25] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[1:08:28] me nothing
[1:08:30] charity suffereth long and is kind
[1:08:32] charity envious not
[1:08:34] he's going through the statue of perfect
[1:08:36] man charity vaulted not itself in other
[1:08:40] words put yourself up here
[1:08:42] it's not puffed up
[1:08:45] so there's your characteristic right
[1:08:46] there now let's go to first corinthians
[1:08:49] 13 13 which is a continuation and now a
[1:08:52] body of faith
[1:08:53] hope and charity these three but the
[1:08:56] greatest of these is charity
[1:08:59] and above all these things put on
[1:09:01] charity which is what the bond of
[1:09:04] perfectness that's the complete stature
[1:09:08] of a perfect man
[1:09:09] why do you think enoch when he built the
[1:09:11] pyramids he didn't put a capstone on it
[1:09:16] there had to have somebody that was
[1:09:18] adopted come
[1:09:21] to preach
[1:09:22] adoption
[1:09:25] because you can't be adopted
[1:09:28] if you're a novice
[1:09:31] and you can't listen to a novice preach
[1:09:34] about adoption
[1:09:36] now i'm not saying anything i definitely
[1:09:37] i told you where i was at but i got to
[1:09:38] get through brother kindness first
[1:09:42] but i can read it to you out of the
[1:09:43] bible
[1:09:45] and what the prophet said colossians 3
[1:09:49] verse 14.
[1:09:52] did i miss one colossians 3 14.
[1:09:54] go back
[1:09:56] down that way
[1:10:01] go that way the other way
[1:10:03] the other way
[1:10:04] the other way well i might not put it on
[1:10:07] there that's my fault
[1:10:09] colossians 3 14 says above all these
[1:10:11] things put on charity which is the bond
[1:10:13] i did read that
[1:10:14] which is the bond well they put
[1:10:17] that's not first corinthians 14 right
[1:10:19] there
[1:10:20] that's colossians
[1:10:23] see they well it's not their fault
[1:10:25] really but they take it off of what i
[1:10:26] give them and they have to reposition it
[1:10:29] so it they just left that's not that's
[1:10:31] not first corinthians 3 14. that's not a
[1:10:32] new doctrine
[1:10:34] i've not changed the word that's
[1:10:35] colossians 3 14 says above all these
[1:10:37] things put on charity which is the bond
[1:10:40] of perfectness all right now let's go to
[1:10:42] the greek
[1:10:43] the word agape agapo cafe
[1:10:47] either one
[1:10:49] look love beloved of persons to welcome
[1:10:52] to entertain to be what fond of to love
[1:10:56] dearly
[1:10:57] god loves us but he wants us to be sons
[1:10:58] and daughters he wants to love us dearly
[1:11:00] of things to be well pleased to be
[1:11:02] contended at or with a thing in other
[1:11:04] words this is my beloved son whom i'm
[1:11:06] pleased to dwell here you him i'm
[1:11:07] pleased with what he's saying but i want
[1:11:09] you to hear what he got to say
[1:11:10] all right so let's go to the next one
[1:11:13] that's number 25 and 26
[1:11:15] on in the greek lexicon love charity
[1:11:18] dear charitable feast of charity
[1:11:20] brotherly love brings it right back down
[1:11:22] affection good will love benevolence but
[1:11:24] remember this has nothing to do
[1:11:27] with your filial love right okay agape
[1:11:30] love is so much brother brown said so
[1:11:32] far from easiest to the west right with
[1:11:35] you the love you have for people here
[1:11:36] versus agape love all right
[1:11:39] so we got and we've got to learn that
[1:11:42] all right now let's go to number nine
[1:11:45] is that your perfect man
[1:11:48] listen you get it
[1:11:50] these people who died in
[1:11:52] here
[1:11:54] church ages
[1:11:57] got it these people who died in here
[1:12:00] are way depending
[1:12:02] and waiting on us
[1:12:05] so this church has got to come to
[1:12:08] perfection in order to bring the
[1:12:09] resurrection amen
[1:12:11] and they're under souls under the altar
[1:12:14] waiting for this church to come to its
[1:12:16] perfection
[1:12:17] that when christ does come and this
[1:12:20] church you see is coming smaller in the
[1:12:22] minority in other words it's getting
[1:12:24] sharper right all right there's a honing
[1:12:27] part that we're probably not get to
[1:12:28] right now it's a whole lot sharper than
[1:12:31] that but just like to write that cross
[1:12:33] there see
[1:12:34] the original drawing
[1:12:36] has brother brown put a cross right here
[1:12:39] if you ever see the original drawing
[1:12:41] there's a cross right here that's what
[1:12:42] he's referring to when he says the cross
[1:12:44] i just wanted to make that clear because
[1:12:46] he'd just like to write that cross there
[1:12:48] see it's the coming up to a needlepoint
[1:12:51] until the church in the minority so
[1:12:54] listen not a public show
[1:12:58] no way it's not going to be a public
[1:12:59] show if you see anything raise up
[1:13:02] and it gets popular
[1:13:05] i want somebody to slap me if i become
[1:13:07] popular
[1:13:09] and if i keep like what i'm doing i
[1:13:10] ain't going to be popular
[1:13:15] i like it that way
[1:13:17] until the church in the minority has got
[1:13:20] to get into a place until it's the same
[1:13:23] kind of ministry that this left what the
[1:13:26] headstone because when this headstone
[1:13:29] comes back see it's got a little pocket
[1:13:31] here like where it's going to sit right
[1:13:33] in there on the regular pyramid it just
[1:13:34] isn't a cap that sits across the top
[1:13:39] all right there's a flange
[1:13:42] that fits
[1:13:46] to keep it from wiggling
[1:13:48] and to keep what
[1:13:50] it's a little flange and it's got to sit
[1:13:52] on there because it sheds what the water
[1:13:55] and when it comes this church has got to
[1:13:58] be honed
[1:13:59] all these rest the stones in the pyramid
[1:14:01] are laying so perfect so you can't run a
[1:14:03] razor between them weighing tons laying
[1:14:05] in there how they got them up they don't
[1:14:07] know but they were built and up here
[1:14:09] when the pyramid cap does come the
[1:14:11] pyramid itself
[1:14:13] the body of christ will have to be honed
[1:14:16] not only just some creed or doctrine or
[1:14:18] something other we come through it'll
[1:14:20] have to be so perfectly like christ till
[1:14:23] when he comes he and that ministry will
[1:14:25] fit right smack together see
[1:14:27] then we'll come the rapture and the
[1:14:29] going home
[1:14:30] amen so we can't be one word off that's
[1:14:33] why we are so adamant in this church
[1:14:35] about even one word of false doctrine
[1:14:38] amen somebody's got to have the perfect
[1:14:40] word to bring a perfect bride to
[1:14:43] perfection
[1:14:44] you cannot bring a perfect bride to
[1:14:46] perfection without perfect word
[1:14:48] amen that's just common sense
[1:14:51] because you know what one word got us
[1:14:53] from here to here right one word
[1:14:57] not
[1:14:58] right
[1:14:59] one word
[1:15:00] so you think one word off is going to
[1:15:02] get us back to here yep
[1:15:04] got to be a perfect word
[1:15:06] not a perfect people a perfect word that
[1:15:08] makes the people perfect
[1:15:10] amen if you look at it that way not a
[1:15:12] perfect people has got a perfect word no
[1:15:14] a perfect word that the people yield
[1:15:17] their self to and then they become
[1:15:19] perfect by that but remember i want to
[1:15:20] be perfect by christ
[1:15:22] right right that's right not by myself
[1:15:25] right
[1:15:26] i want christ to be the one to do it but
[1:15:27] then will come the rapture the going
[1:15:30] home so what's the rapture waiting on
[1:15:33] me and you
[1:15:35] to bring the same ministry that the head
[1:15:38] has because remember in our picture a
[1:15:40] long time ago they rejected this
[1:15:44] they rejected the son of man ministry
[1:15:46] when they put him on a cross
[1:15:48] they said you're not god
[1:15:50] you're a man making yourself god
[1:15:53] no he was god made himself a man
[1:15:55] and when we come back to that to see
[1:15:57] that now god has made himself a a man
[1:16:03] hallelujah
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:12] we got to believe it more
[1:16:14] i hate going to funerals
[1:16:17] i despise them
[1:16:19] oh you know well that's that's wonderful
[1:16:21] if you're a christian that's okay
[1:16:23] but that's not our call
[1:16:25] our call is to be here on the earth and
[1:16:29] to call the ones that have went on out
[1:16:31] of the grave because remember it wasn't
[1:16:34] dead people talking to dead people when
[1:16:35] jesus rose
[1:16:39] it was live people talking to live
[1:16:41] people right
[1:16:43] why seek ye the living among the dead
[1:16:50] galatians 3
[1:16:52] we're not going to get finished
[1:16:57] unless you'll bear with me about another
[1:16:59] 45 minutes
[1:17:00] but before faith came we were kept under
[1:17:02] the law i love this because this takes
[1:17:04] you
[1:17:05] from
[1:17:06] the new birth
[1:17:08] to adoption
[1:17:09] and remember we're going to go through
[1:17:11] galatians three and four and for those
[1:17:14] of you that that are not
[1:17:15] that that are new
[1:17:18] paul's writing a letter now
[1:17:20] man put these in
[1:17:24] verses
[1:17:26] and chapters
[1:17:27] but paul when he wrote a letter to the
[1:17:29] galatians he wrote a letter right right
[1:17:32] so watch this continuation of a letter
[1:17:34] but before faith came we were kept under
[1:17:37] the law
[1:17:39] remember works
[1:17:40] we're going to be judged by our words if
[1:17:42] we're not born again all right
[1:17:46] that thing is sensitive
[1:17:52] but before faith came we were kept on i
[1:17:55] used to like this thing but i don't
[1:17:56] think i like it anymore
[1:17:57] shut up unto the faith which should
[1:18:00] afterwards be revealed so it's gotta be
[1:18:01] a revelation
[1:18:03] before the law wherefore the law was our
[1:18:05] schoolmaster now we talked about this
[1:18:07] once before but we got to go through it
[1:18:09] again what was the school master the
[1:18:11] school master when you were in school
[1:18:12] was not the teacher
[1:18:15] remember the old school mom or what we
[1:18:17] call a principal the principal actually
[1:18:19] now sometimes they did in the natural
[1:18:21] but most of the time the principal was
[1:18:23] the principal he didn't teach
[1:18:24] class he entrusted that to the school
[1:18:27] teachers all right
[1:18:29] but
[1:18:30] we were under a school master the law
[1:18:32] was our school masters or what to bring
[1:18:35] us to christ because it had to tell us
[1:18:37] we were
[1:18:38] wrong the law told us we were wrong so
[1:18:42] it brought us to christ that we might be
[1:18:44] what justified by faith but after that
[1:18:47] faith has come we're no longer under a
[1:18:49] schoolmaster
[1:18:50] all right the law has been done away
[1:18:52] with for you are all children of god by
[1:18:54] faith in christ jesus whereas many of
[1:18:57] you has been baptized into christ have
[1:18:59] put on christ there's neither jew or
[1:19:00] greek there's neither bond or free
[1:19:02] there's neither male or female for
[1:19:03] you're all one in christ jesus and if
[1:19:05] you be christ then what are ye abraham's
[1:19:08] seed and heirs according to the promise
[1:19:10] now man broke it right there and put
[1:19:12] chapter four in forget about that keep
[1:19:14] going
[1:19:16] don't put that in there don't even put
[1:19:18] one too because look now i say
[1:19:20] he's continuing his thought
[1:19:22] now i say does everybody understand that
[1:19:24] saying man if you don't i'll go over it
[1:19:25] again you understand that galatians come
[1:19:27] all the way down three all the way down
[1:19:29] now what we have become
[1:19:32] in christ not under a schoolmaster
[1:19:34] anymore but we've come to christ by
[1:19:35] faith what right here
[1:19:38] all right but now watch we're not
[1:19:40] finished now i say
[1:19:42] that the heir as long as he is a
[1:19:45] child
[1:19:49] difference nothing from the servant
[1:19:51] though he be lord
[1:19:54] of all right got it
[1:19:56] right he's got full inheritance
[1:19:59] but
[1:20:00] he can't drive a car yet
[1:20:04] it's under what tutors and governors
[1:20:06] there's your teachers
[1:20:08] until what the time appointed of the
[1:20:11] father right
[1:20:14] god takes you out
[1:20:17] and does the right of adoption god is
[1:20:19] the one that that determines whether
[1:20:21] your name is good as a checkbook
[1:20:23] because remember
[1:20:25] remember
[1:20:26] power without character
[1:20:29] you're going to write a bounce check
[1:20:32] even so we when we were children were in
[1:20:35] bondage under the elements of the world
[1:20:39] we were babbling babies right
[1:20:41] but when the fullness of the time was
[1:20:44] come
[1:20:44] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:20:47] made under the law
[1:20:49] to redeem them that were under the law
[1:20:51] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:20:53] sons amen all right be adopted the only
[1:20:56] way you can be adopted listen god does
[1:20:58] not adopt the devil's kids
[1:21:04] and you know the reason that
[1:21:07] the reason that benny and brenda didn't
[1:21:08] go to the funeral today is because what
[1:21:11] they're not dales
[1:21:13] i mean sure they would do it by the
[1:21:14] respect but it's not family when we call
[1:21:17] a family reunion donnie and susan don't
[1:21:19] show up
[1:21:21] right
[1:21:22] right
[1:21:23] i mean they could if they wanted to get
[1:21:25] the point
[1:21:30] they're not dale's so they don't you
[1:21:31] know if if something was to happen to
[1:21:33] brother dale it'd be me and terrence and
[1:21:35] anna
[1:21:36] none of you you left out sorry because
[1:21:39] why you're not a part of the family same
[1:21:41] way with god he's not going to bestow
[1:21:43] gifts upon the devil's kids he's not
[1:21:45] going to adopt the devil's kids he's
[1:21:47] only going to adopt his family that we
[1:21:49] might receive the adoption of sons
[1:21:52] and because you are sons god has sent
[1:21:55] forth the spirit of his son
[1:21:57] into your hearts crying daily daddy
[1:22:00] that's right have our father's daddy
[1:22:02] daddy
[1:22:03] amen wherefore thou art no more a
[1:22:05] servant
[1:22:10] but a son
[1:22:12] and what
[1:22:14] then an heir of god through christ amen
[1:22:18] so that's what's bringing us up into
[1:22:20] adoption sure
[1:22:22] god's pleased to dwell in you
[1:22:25] absolutely pleased to dwell in you the
[1:22:26] day you get born again
[1:22:30] but he doesn't want you to stop there
[1:22:33] so now let's go to romans
[1:22:36] 8 14.
[1:22:38] now i want you to brother dale did this
[1:22:40] several years ago and i try to do it a
[1:22:42] lot out out away from here because i
[1:22:44] believe it's important
[1:22:46] because most of the time when you say
[1:22:48] adoption
[1:22:50] everybody goes
[1:22:53] adoption they either say one they either
[1:22:55] say well we're already adopted because
[1:22:57] we got it when we believe no that's not
[1:22:59] true
[1:23:01] because remember
[1:23:03] you're going to receive the spirit of
[1:23:05] adoption
[1:23:07] not adoption
[1:23:10] i don't have the quote with me but i
[1:23:11] read it this past sunday brother branham
[1:23:14] said that's two different things
[1:23:16] your born-again experience is one thing
[1:23:18] and your adoption is another but you've
[1:23:20] got to be born again in order to be in
[1:23:23] line for adoption
[1:23:24] you've got to become an heir in other
[1:23:26] words to get the part of the air that
[1:23:28] the air gets and we're going to read
[1:23:30] that
[1:23:31] so there's two different things a lot of
[1:23:32] people say well we're in the adoption
[1:23:34] age because brother branham was here and
[1:23:36] he well no
[1:23:37] that was for him at that point
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:41] you got to see it for you amen
[1:23:44] you've got to see it for you hallelujah
[1:23:47] okay
[1:23:49] everybody all right
[1:23:51] because we're going to go through this
[1:23:52] and we're going to go through the three
[1:23:53] stages of adoption and i'll try to get
[1:23:56] it done in 30 minutes if that's all
[1:23:57] right that okay
[1:24:00] most of you are not asleep yet but
[1:24:02] before you go to the land of nod let me
[1:24:04] tell you this
[1:24:06] turn to romans 8
[1:24:08] or you can read it here at verse 14.
[1:24:11] now this is going to take us through the
[1:24:12] three stages of adoption there's three
[1:24:14] stages there's birth
[1:24:17] there's authority
[1:24:19] and there's understanding
[1:24:21] three stages of adoption i'm listen
[1:24:24] we're we're we're out we're out of the
[1:24:25] son of god dispensation we're in the son
[1:24:27] of man dismissation all right
[1:24:30] you remember me preaching one time
[1:24:32] justification sanctification baptism
[1:24:33] holy ghost justification sanctification
[1:24:35] baptism holy ghost justification
[1:24:37] sanctification baptism and holy ghost
[1:24:38] you never do get
[1:24:40] away from those three things
[1:24:42] right
[1:24:43] brother brown said there's a mysterious
[1:24:44] part of justification sure the
[1:24:46] justification where you were born again
[1:24:47] where you came in and had your sins
[1:24:50] forgiven sure but you still had that old
[1:24:52] nature
[1:24:53] right but when you come to this
[1:24:55] justification here
[1:24:57] he said it's as if you've never done it
[1:24:59] and he said then the real you never did
[1:25:01] it
[1:25:02] if we don't come to that people we're
[1:25:03] still going to lean back to where that
[1:25:05] devil says yeah you did it
[1:25:08] yeah you did it no devil you tricked me
[1:25:11] into doing it
[1:25:12] you're a tricker you're a tripper upper
[1:25:17] hey if you're born again
[1:25:19] how many times i preached on genesis 1
[1:25:20] 26
[1:25:22] that's your new birth
[1:25:23] that that part of you never fail right
[1:25:27] that part of you never had a bad day
[1:25:30] that part of you never said a bad word
[1:25:32] that part of you never had a sex
[1:25:33] relationship
[1:25:35] you only had a relationship with jesus
[1:25:36] christ
[1:25:37] the spirit word of god amen that's why
[1:25:40] if we don't we got to understand what we
[1:25:42] already got inside of us what the
[1:25:43] bible's already said about us and what
[1:25:44] the prophets already said about us
[1:25:46] because we got to believe what our
[1:25:47] prophet said but watch let's take it
[1:25:49] strictly from romans 8 verse 14. for as
[1:25:51] many as are led by the spirit of god
[1:25:54] they are the sons of god amen for ye
[1:25:56] have not received the spirit of what
[1:25:59] bondage again to fear now what happened
[1:26:01] when
[1:26:02] when adam we're going to talk about adam
[1:26:04] in a minute but remember adam and god
[1:26:07] and eve talk together face to face all
[1:26:10] the time
[1:26:12] right
[1:26:13] there was no fear
[1:26:15] none
[1:26:17] brother brown said god would come down
[1:26:18] and cool the day and say adam how was
[1:26:19] your day
[1:26:21] just con conversation like me and you
[1:26:23] brother issue would have but what's the
[1:26:24] first thing adam said when they fell
[1:26:27] oh uh he said adam where art thou he
[1:26:30] said i
[1:26:31] was
[1:26:33] afraid
[1:26:37] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:26:39] bondage that genesis 1 26 man don't fear
[1:26:44] but you have not received the spirit of
[1:26:46] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:26:48] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:26:51] we cry daddy daddy right the spirit
[1:26:54] itself bearing witness with our spirit
[1:26:58] that we are the children of god
[1:27:00] children of god watch this children cry
[1:27:04] in children children cry
[1:27:09] and if children
[1:27:11] then heirs now look people this is not a
[1:27:13] kid this is not a child
[1:27:16] but as we grow up we grow up from a
[1:27:18] child
[1:27:19] to what to authority
[1:27:21] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[1:27:23] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:27:24] god and if children then heirs
[1:27:27] heirs of god
[1:27:30] and joint heirs with christ
[1:27:32] whatever he gets we get right
[1:27:35] are the bibles wrong
[1:27:37] now did did jesus christ take a body
[1:27:40] change
[1:27:41] christ never had to but jesus christ did
[1:27:45] all right is that okay
[1:27:47] because he was the son of man
[1:27:48] the son of man is the only one to take a
[1:27:50] body chain
[1:27:51] christ don't need a body change
[1:27:54] but for your in my sake he came down
[1:27:57] here and took on a form of flesh
[1:27:59] so that we can have a body change all
[1:28:01] right everybody okay with that say amen
[1:28:04] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:28:07] that we may be also glorified together
[1:28:10] all right is that true
[1:28:13] you got your car keys will you
[1:28:24] drive them home
[1:28:28] go get in the car and drive them home
[1:28:29] when we're finished with the service can
[1:28:30] you do that
[1:28:33] no hold on yeah there you go but now
[1:28:35] look he's a human
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:40] he has intelligence
[1:28:43] he's got eyes he can see
[1:28:45] he's got ears he's a human why can't he
[1:28:48] drive a car
[1:28:49] she's a human
[1:28:51] she's got eyes on both sides well two of
[1:28:53] one of them on each side of her nose
[1:28:58] most of the time mothers have them right
[1:28:59] here in the middle and right here in the
[1:29:00] back
[1:29:02] but why can't he here you better give me
[1:29:03] that why can't he do that
[1:29:06] now look when you're born again god
[1:29:08] doesn't give you this
[1:29:11] but yet the car's there
[1:29:14] the car's there for you to drive
[1:29:17] but you got to get a driver's license in
[1:29:20] other words what's the difference
[1:29:21] between
[1:29:22] benjamin
[1:29:24] and his mom
[1:29:26] she's mature
[1:29:28] and the state of georgia or whatever
[1:29:30] state you're in says that when you get
[1:29:32] 16 years old which i don't agree with
[1:29:35] you're mature enough to drive a car
[1:29:38] god says the same thing now remember
[1:29:40] he's the son of her he's in the family
[1:29:44] why doesn't he get the car keys
[1:29:47] he's a child
[1:29:49] child
[1:29:50] child children child look at all those
[1:29:52] and if children then heirs now he's an
[1:29:54] heir to that car
[1:29:57] but you don't get
[1:29:58] don't give him the keys
[1:30:01] until what he has reached a maturity
[1:30:04] level we all have to come to a place do
[1:30:08] you remember i remember when i first
[1:30:10] became born again
[1:30:13] god would just answer all my prayers
[1:30:16] i don't know if he did you the same way
[1:30:18] but
[1:30:18] but i think when we're all when we come
[1:30:20] to that baby form of of being born again
[1:30:23] we do cry daddy daddy
[1:30:25] daddy daddy now look
[1:30:27] josh is not here today
[1:30:30] but i don't want him to call me up every
[1:30:31] five minutes crying
[1:30:36] i want him to grow up now there was a
[1:30:37] time and a point there was an appointed
[1:30:39] time
[1:30:41] he was under tutors and governors
[1:30:44] raised up in the family to what
[1:30:47] not
[1:30:48] being taught to cry about everything
[1:30:50] amen to be a man about things same way
[1:30:53] with god the way the way i can see
[1:30:55] adoption is exactly the way you you grow
[1:30:58] and you raise your children i know we we
[1:31:00] do a bad job of that but you still have
[1:31:03] to see that those children are so cute
[1:31:05] and and they depend on you as parents
[1:31:08] i don't want them to be 30 years old and
[1:31:10] depending on me hallelujah parents says
[1:31:13] amen
[1:31:15] it says leave your father and mother and
[1:31:18] cleave to your wife it doesn't say leave
[1:31:20] your wife and cleave to your parents
[1:31:29] got that
[1:31:34] that was just the whitley son i was
[1:31:36] talking to
[1:31:39] i tell you what i had a lot of respect
[1:31:40] for your dad you knew that i mean
[1:31:42] brother willie ross stood right here
[1:31:44] many times and preached the word of god
[1:31:46] a long time ago and they would just fill
[1:31:48] this church up for when it was like this
[1:31:51] and just the power of god was with the
[1:31:52] man
[1:31:53] and they could sing like you wouldn't
[1:31:55] believe well you saw that you guys in
[1:31:57] the whole even the
[1:31:59] even the in-laws can sing
[1:32:04] yeah you can
[1:32:05] even the in-laws can sing
[1:32:08] i have godly jealousy of that
[1:32:14] and if children then heirs
[1:32:17] their heirs their mind
[1:32:19] and join heirs with christ so they get
[1:32:21] everything i get
[1:32:22] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:32:25] may be also glorified together so the
[1:32:27] first part of your adoption is
[1:32:29] definitely you got to be born again and
[1:32:30] grow up in god
[1:32:33] you cannot be adopted without these
[1:32:35] working in your life and they're sealing
[1:32:37] you in
[1:32:38] so forget about it without these
[1:32:42] brother brown said without these we're a
[1:32:44] stumbling block to the unbeliever
[1:32:47] that's what he said
[1:32:48] i believe it's in blasphemous names he
[1:32:50] said we become a stumbling block when
[1:32:52] they see us not acting like a
[1:32:54] full-fledged christian should act
[1:32:58] but remember though if we're born again
[1:33:00] we're still heirs
[1:33:02] because remember kids act up
[1:33:05] but as we grow in grace and knowledge
[1:33:07] you begin to shed that and gain some
[1:33:10] maturity now let's continue reading
[1:33:13] so that's your first stage that's the
[1:33:14] birth
[1:33:15] for i reckon that the suffering of this
[1:33:17] present time are not worthy to be
[1:33:18] compared with the glory which shall what
[1:33:21] be revealed in jesus name
[1:33:26] shall be revealed in
[1:33:29] us
[1:33:31] so there's a revelation amen as we come
[1:33:33] down there's a revelation for the
[1:33:35] earnest expectation of the creature now
[1:33:39] let's go back
[1:33:41] let's go back because we got to start we
[1:33:42] got to talk about authority i'm sorry
[1:33:44] i'm going to be a little bit long today
[1:33:46] but just gonna have to bear with it for
[1:33:48] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:33:50] waiteth
[1:33:51] for the manifestation
[1:33:53] of the sons of god
[1:33:57] why
[1:33:59] this was authority
[1:34:02] right this adam and eve in the garden
[1:34:05] this was authority i love what brother
[1:34:07] luis was talking about the other day
[1:34:10] because he hit the nail on the head
[1:34:12] adam had full authority of the earth god
[1:34:14] said look adam i'm going to take care of
[1:34:17] the heaven i'm going to make sure the
[1:34:18] stars work and i'm going to make sure
[1:34:20] the galaxies run because it's kind of
[1:34:21] big but i'm going to put you on the
[1:34:23] earth and you're going to be the god of
[1:34:25] the earth
[1:34:27] and i'm not going to question what you
[1:34:29] say
[1:34:33] because remember adam
[1:34:36] named all the animals
[1:34:38] and i like what brother louise said
[1:34:40] because it makes the point strike more
[1:34:42] than the way i used to bring it out
[1:34:44] yeah we learn from each other
[1:34:48] adam said that's an elephant
[1:34:50] and god said that's exactly what i was
[1:34:52] going to say
[1:34:53] that's what i was thinking all along
[1:34:56] adam said that's a zebra
[1:34:59] funny looking horse but it's a zebra god
[1:35:02] said that's exactly what i was going to
[1:35:03] call that what the two minds work
[1:35:06] together
[1:35:08] that's authority when adam said
[1:35:10] something god didn't have to go into
[1:35:12] crisis mode
[1:35:17] to clean up the mess because remember
[1:35:19] even at the fall adam knew what he was
[1:35:21] doing
[1:35:24] he knew exactly what he was doing he
[1:35:26] knew he was going to sell the human race
[1:35:27] out when he did what he did
[1:35:29] but he couldn't kill her because she was
[1:35:31] part of him that was the agape love i'm
[1:35:33] talking about filio love would have said
[1:35:36] god throw that slot away and get me
[1:35:38] another one
[1:35:40] are you're quiet
[1:35:43] you let your spouse go lay down with the
[1:35:45] beast
[1:35:47] would you invite her right back in
[1:35:51] come on people
[1:35:54] that's why it was agape love
[1:35:56] adam looked past every bit of that
[1:35:59] and he said god she's mine
[1:36:02] she's me
[1:36:04] and that's what
[1:36:05] jesus christ on the cross he looked down
[1:36:07] and he said there me god forgive them of
[1:36:11] their sins
[1:36:13] for i reckon that the suffering of this
[1:36:15] present time was not worthy to be
[1:36:16] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:36:18] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:36:20] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:36:22] the manifestation of the sons of god so
[1:36:24] what fell man fell first right who fell
[1:36:26] underneath
[1:36:29] all creation
[1:36:31] fell under the man because he was the
[1:36:33] highest form of creation everything fell
[1:36:36] underneath
[1:36:37] for the creature was made subject to
[1:36:39] vanity not willingly
[1:36:43] that's why after a while the lion wanted
[1:36:45] to eat adam
[1:36:48] he sold them all out
[1:36:50] but by reason of him who has subjected
[1:36:53] the same in hope in other words it's
[1:36:55] coming right back up through man again
[1:36:57] because the creature itself also now
[1:36:59] what watch if you've got a scofield
[1:37:01] bible that creature is translated to
[1:37:04] creation
[1:37:06] the whole creation groaneth in waiteth
[1:37:08] we'll we read it for the creature was
[1:37:10] made subjects abandoned not willing but
[1:37:12] by reason of him who has subjected the
[1:37:13] same in hope
[1:37:14] because the creature itself also shall
[1:37:17] be delivered
[1:37:19] from the bondage of corruption
[1:37:22] now let's translate that we must do that
[1:37:25] first right
[1:37:27] that's right
[1:37:30] because remember
[1:37:31] we fell first and everything fell below
[1:37:33] us well if we're going to restore it
[1:37:34] back we've got to come back to where it
[1:37:36] fell
[1:37:37] then everything's going to come up to it
[1:37:39] because the creature itself also shall
[1:37:41] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:37:42] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:37:45] the children of god for we know that the
[1:37:48] whole creation groaneth and travails and
[1:37:52] pained together until
[1:37:54] now
[1:37:56] until now
[1:37:59] until now you and i
[1:38:02] there's the second stage we must come
[1:38:05] back to where we have authority
[1:38:07] first over one nature
[1:38:10] yours
[1:38:13] yours
[1:38:15] you got to have control over your nature
[1:38:18] before you can control that nature
[1:38:20] out here
[1:38:21] amen and that's what this is this is a
[1:38:24] nature change
[1:38:25] you're having your nature change you're
[1:38:27] growing in god and god's going to come
[1:38:30] up there one day and say look you've
[1:38:32] come to a place
[1:38:33] to where
[1:38:35] an act of restoration has happened
[1:38:39] and you know what
[1:38:42] i didn't want you to say much when you
[1:38:44] first got born again because he's a kid
[1:38:47] babbling babies
[1:38:49] that's right but when you come to the
[1:38:51] authority stage where your name is just
[1:38:53] as good on the checkbook as your
[1:38:55] father's
[1:38:58] then what's going to stop what you say
[1:39:00] him backing it up
[1:39:04] see we haven't come to that yet
[1:39:06] altogether i said all together
[1:39:09] we haven't
[1:39:11] there's a lot of things that we could
[1:39:13] say about that that happened even here
[1:39:14] at the church
[1:39:16] with with brother coley's gun being
[1:39:18] called back several things brother
[1:39:19] harris several things has happened but
[1:39:22] listen god wants it to fire like
[1:39:24] fireworks
[1:39:25] he wants everybody to come in to where
[1:39:27] he can say
[1:39:29] i trust what you say
[1:39:31] right
[1:39:32] because what happened with brother
[1:39:33] branham you see in brother branham's
[1:39:35] life we know he came to adoption amen
[1:39:38] because the word couldn't have been
[1:39:40] unfolded any further had he not been
[1:39:42] adopted because up here is where you got
[1:39:44] the son of man ministry which is the
[1:39:45] seals and all the full opening of the
[1:39:47] word everybody understand that
[1:39:49] amen
[1:39:51] amen
[1:39:52] amen
[1:39:53] all right so that's where he came to the
[1:39:54] full adoption where brother where god
[1:39:56] said hear ye him
[1:39:58] you're going to hear it you're going to
[1:39:59] get it from him well now you know what
[1:40:01] that's the same thing's going to happen
[1:40:02] to you and i because remember
[1:40:08] thus saith the lord is good
[1:40:12] but the bible says
[1:40:15] you say
[1:40:17] to this mountain
[1:40:23] thus saith the lord is saying what the
[1:40:25] lord said
[1:40:30] oh we you you're going too far no we
[1:40:32] ain't got far enough
[1:40:35] this body is going to be changed by what
[1:40:37] you speak
[1:40:39] your body changed you're going to speak
[1:40:40] brother dale cannot speak your body
[1:40:42] change right you're going to have to
[1:40:44] speak your own body change so guess what
[1:40:46] if he's got authority that's fine but
[1:40:48] i'm going to have to have authority amen
[1:40:52] thank you lord
[1:40:54] i hope that's great
[1:40:56] i do too
[1:40:58] cause they had a cloud in the sky
[1:41:05] where was i
[1:41:07] for we know that the whole creation
[1:41:08] growth is revealed in pain until now now
[1:41:11] with brother branham you can tell
[1:41:12] several things happened in his life if
[1:41:14] you remember one time when remember he
[1:41:17] came up there
[1:41:18] and he came up to that storm or he went
[1:41:20] up on top of the mountain
[1:41:22] and he what he's he he didn't say thus
[1:41:25] saith the lord's storm go out of
[1:41:26] existence
[1:41:28] did he
[1:41:32] the lord jesus told him said
[1:41:34] you
[1:41:35] speak it right
[1:41:37] and he did he said storm he even told
[1:41:39] the storm what to do he said storm leave
[1:41:41] and said and it's going to be you know
[1:41:43] we're going to have sunshine for four
[1:41:45] days and he just kept telling nature
[1:41:46] what to do
[1:41:48] all right so that's where you and i but
[1:41:49] remember
[1:41:51] god didn't sit up there going no no no
[1:41:52] no don't say it no don't say that don't
[1:41:54] say that no he was pleased
[1:41:56] with what that man said he came and
[1:41:59] backed up what he said because he had
[1:42:01] come to a position that you and i must
[1:42:04] come to
[1:42:05] because remember after that happened he
[1:42:08] comes down off the mountain if you
[1:42:09] remember god said come and walk with me
[1:42:11] so he was walking
[1:42:15] adam
[1:42:18] is that what he said
[1:42:20] and the way he said i didn't bring a
[1:42:21] quote but i'm gonna get close he said
[1:42:24] come walk with me now what was that
[1:42:27] and then what did they come across they
[1:42:28] come across the two deer
[1:42:31] they come across two deer now most of us
[1:42:34] are deer hunters and we can't get that
[1:42:35] close to deer especially he said after
[1:42:37] they've been shot at so many times but
[1:42:39] he said those deer were so close he
[1:42:40] could touch him with his rifle barrel
[1:42:43] that would probably be
[1:42:44] closer than me and brother al
[1:42:46] okay
[1:42:48] and said they looked at him
[1:42:50] and there was no fear
[1:42:54] if you could just think about what those
[1:42:57] animals were thinking
[1:42:59] because nature feels god sometimes
[1:43:01] before we do
[1:43:03] but those two deer i'll guarantee you if
[1:43:05] you could get inside their brain they
[1:43:07] were looking at that man
[1:43:11] they said adam is that you
[1:43:14] adam are you back in power
[1:43:16] because we're groaning
[1:43:19] we're groaning and travailing in pain
[1:43:21] together until now
[1:43:22] waiting on me and you
[1:43:24] to come to a place brother brown said
[1:43:27] that bull had such a bewildered look on
[1:43:28] his face why because that bull's nature
[1:43:31] was to kill the human
[1:43:33] but that bull was
[1:43:35] he felt an anointing he never felt
[1:43:37] before
[1:43:41] what about you and i he said oh that was
[1:43:43] for a prophet
[1:43:44] i disagree with him right because he's
[1:43:47] gone on
[1:43:48] and now we've got to get him out of the
[1:43:49] grave
[1:43:54] by what he said
[1:43:57] nothing else but by what he said i
[1:43:59] believe that with all my heart i believe
[1:44:01] that's right
[1:44:04] but he gave us provision before he left
[1:44:08] and it's lying he said in the books and
[1:44:11] tapes not on them
[1:44:12] that's a problem sometimes we read on
[1:44:14] the books
[1:44:15] we don't read in the book
[1:44:19] amen
[1:44:21] and not only they
[1:44:24] not finished yet this is authority we
[1:44:27] got to come back to authority
[1:44:30] and not only they who nature
[1:44:33] but ourselves also which have the first
[1:44:36] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[1:44:38] grown within ourselves
[1:44:41] right
[1:44:43] they got to feel the pull from us
[1:44:46] waiting for the adoption to wit now that
[1:44:49] word to it means to understand
[1:44:52] the redemption of our body
[1:44:54] now
[1:44:56] for we are saved by hope but hope that
[1:44:58] is seen is not
[1:45:01] that's hope
[1:45:02] if your kids are already sitting here
[1:45:04] saving the saints to find filled with
[1:45:05] the holy ghost why are you hoping
[1:45:07] they're coming
[1:45:08] they're here
[1:45:10] so that's the same thing with this we we
[1:45:12] we hope for these but what about when we
[1:45:14] don't have to hope when we see it
[1:45:16] for what a man seeth why doth he yet
[1:45:19] hope for that's right
[1:45:21] but if we hope for that which we see not
[1:45:24] then do we with patience
[1:45:27] wait for
[1:45:28] it second stage of adoption is authority
[1:45:31] third stage is to understand the
[1:45:34] redemption
[1:45:35] of the body
[1:45:36] amen
[1:45:38] you say no that's the body changed now
[1:45:39] brother brown didn't go through a body
[1:45:40] changes he was adopted
[1:45:43] but we got to understand that this is
[1:45:45] the age for adoption this is the age for
[1:45:48] the body change and if we don't take a
[1:45:50] body change
[1:45:51] we're going to take a body change that's
[1:45:53] for sure
[1:45:57] it's going to go to the undertaker and
[1:45:58] they're going to take your blood out and
[1:46:00] all that other stuff
[1:46:01] yeah he's going to be a change all right
[1:46:04] but there's got to be somebody church
[1:46:06] amen
[1:46:07] that's got to come through this
[1:46:09] every one of these stages birth
[1:46:11] authority
[1:46:13] understand the redemption of the body
[1:46:15] what's the last enemy to be destroyed
[1:46:18] death
[1:46:19] that's the whole thing that we look for
[1:46:20] is that death
[1:46:22] death is the big thing that we don't
[1:46:24] know anything about
[1:46:27] but brother branham came went across the
[1:46:29] curtain of time
[1:46:31] come back across and he said why should
[1:46:33] you fear death
[1:46:35] why should you fear death
[1:46:38] when death is the vehicle that takes you
[1:46:40] right into the presence of god
[1:46:42] but listen
[1:46:45] death
[1:46:46] must be destroyed
[1:46:48] in us
[1:46:51] death must be destroyed so we got to
[1:46:53] understand
[1:46:55] the redemption of our body
[1:46:57] we got to understand that death sure is
[1:47:00] a vehicle to take some to the grave and
[1:47:02] take them right on into christ but
[1:47:03] there's going to be a group of people
[1:47:04] that's going to have stand on this earth
[1:47:06] and going to have to say
[1:47:09] death where's your sting
[1:47:11] grave where is your
[1:47:13] victory now let me finish with this and
[1:47:16] i may have told you before but i'm going
[1:47:17] to tell you again because you probably
[1:47:19] already forgot it
[1:47:21] if death is our big
[1:47:23] oh
[1:47:25] death is that
[1:47:26] you know
[1:47:28] it's that big oops you know you don't
[1:47:29] know what you don't know what it is
[1:47:32] but let's look at it like this and i've
[1:47:34] i've told it many times to others before
[1:47:35] and i think it kind of sticks home
[1:47:37] because we always do the uh we always
[1:47:39] talk about david and goliath you know
[1:47:40] you've heard since she's a little boy
[1:47:41] about david and goliath david and
[1:47:42] goliath david bender
[1:47:44] picking up five stones and him throwing
[1:47:45] it at the giant and the giant is this
[1:47:47] and the giant stack things you got to
[1:47:49] overcome well let's back on up just a
[1:47:51] little bit
[1:47:52] because there we've been talking about a
[1:47:54] special anointing right everybody wake
[1:47:56] up just for a minute listen we've been
[1:47:57] talking about a special anointing right
[1:47:59] all right so what did samuel now samuel
[1:48:02] was the prophet of the hour
[1:48:04] let's go back in the old testament
[1:48:06] samuel was the prophet of the hour he
[1:48:08] was the one that god
[1:48:10] talked to and talked through right all
[1:48:13] right he was the prophet of the day now
[1:48:15] samuel god tells samuel says samuel you
[1:48:17] need to go find israel a king
[1:48:20] samuel gets the anointing oil and by
[1:48:23] leading of the holy spirit he comes up
[1:48:24] to jesse's house he knocks on the door
[1:48:27] and jesse says come in samuel says i'm
[1:48:30] here for one purpose remember he didn't
[1:48:32] talk too much he said where are your
[1:48:34] sons
[1:48:37] stood them out there all in front of him
[1:48:40] samuel looked at the first church age
[1:48:46] second church age
[1:48:47] no
[1:48:48] third fourth fifth sixth
[1:48:50] all the way down
[1:48:52] samuel says there's a problem here
[1:48:54] somewhere
[1:48:56] because i've been sent here to anoint a
[1:48:57] king
[1:48:58] right and this all your sons
[1:49:02] oh i got one more
[1:49:04] he's a shepherd
[1:49:06] he's out in the field
[1:49:07] he's taking he's in other words he had a
[1:49:09] job
[1:49:16] i hadn't thought of that for now
[1:49:19] he had a job
[1:49:21] the other ones didn't
[1:49:23] but you remember the other ones didn't
[1:49:24] have a job they weren't called to
[1:49:26] adoption
[1:49:27] they weren't called to a body change
[1:49:30] so samuel takes the oil and he says
[1:49:32] something's wrong
[1:49:33] there's got to be another one he said i
[1:49:34] got one more remember because he was in
[1:49:36] the house it had to be the household of
[1:49:37] jesse
[1:49:38] had to be an heir
[1:49:41] i'm going somewhere with this just pay
[1:49:42] attention
[1:49:44] so david comes up and samuel says
[1:49:47] that's the man
[1:49:49] the anointing was the same
[1:49:51] so he takes the oil and he pours it on
[1:49:53] david
[1:49:54] anoints him to be king of israel
[1:49:58] several years later
[1:50:01] several years later
[1:50:04] 50 something years later
[1:50:09] david
[1:50:10] goes and visits his brothers
[1:50:15] he was a young boy when he was anointed
[1:50:16] he had to grow up
[1:50:19] but remember samuel anointed him to be
[1:50:21] king
[1:50:24] he had to grow up so he goes to the
[1:50:26] battleground and he talks to his
[1:50:27] brothers
[1:50:29] and he hears in the background a voice
[1:50:34] he said
[1:50:36] why are all you
[1:50:39] why are all you scared of this guy
[1:50:43] named death right
[1:50:45] because if you fought with that guy that
[1:50:47] philistine you gonna die
[1:50:50] without some kind of special anointing
[1:50:52] you're gonna die
[1:50:53] he was like 14 feet tall and i mean he
[1:50:55] was just
[1:50:56] way bigger than anybody that we know
[1:50:58] around here today right so you were
[1:51:00] gonna die but david had no problem with
[1:51:02] that
[1:51:04] he said why are you letting this
[1:51:07] uncircumcised philistine
[1:51:10] that's right
[1:51:11] exactly defy the army of god are the
[1:51:15] children of god
[1:51:17] children of god
[1:51:22] but the whole point of this is
[1:51:25] david didn't just have faith
[1:51:28] in david
[1:51:34] right
[1:51:36] 50 years ago
[1:51:38] there was a prophet
[1:51:41] come on the land
[1:51:43] and he had an anointing oil
[1:51:46] and he anointed me to be a king
[1:51:50] and you think i'm going to let that
[1:51:53] get in my way
[1:51:56] he believed what his prophet said
[1:52:00] and he says and david said you know what
[1:52:04] until i sit on the throne
[1:52:06] i'm invincible
[1:52:11] i'm not gonna die
[1:52:14] till i sit on that throne if i believe
[1:52:17] what my prophet said
[1:52:19] if i believe that that special anointing
[1:52:23] was poured on me
[1:52:25] in my age
[1:52:29] amen revelations 5 says you're going to
[1:52:31] be white
[1:52:32] kings and priests
[1:52:40] if you ever see that people
[1:52:43] death will not harm you
[1:52:45] david wasn't only
[1:52:48] it wasn't all just him
[1:52:51] he believed what that man said
[1:52:53] he believed what them 1150 sermons said
[1:52:57] he believed he was the prophet he
[1:52:59] believed what he said and he said hey
[1:53:01] i'm invincible
[1:53:04] so death
[1:53:06] where's your sting
[1:53:08] grave where's your victory
[1:53:10] we have all things
[1:53:12] through christ
[1:53:13] who strengthens me
[1:53:15] be of david
[1:53:17] be a david fight your way through now
[1:53:20] look david didn't just walk up there and
[1:53:23] and goliath look at him and go
[1:53:30] no goliath stood there until he about
[1:53:32] that far from that thing hitting him in
[1:53:34] the face
[1:53:36] right
[1:53:37] until he got that real warm feeling
[1:53:39] between his eyes he still thought he
[1:53:41] could defeat david he thought david he
[1:53:43] said i'll just take my spear and i'll
[1:53:44] feed you to the
[1:53:46] what
[1:53:47] feed you to the to the birds
[1:53:49] but about that far when he saw that rock
[1:53:51] about right here
[1:53:53] he knew he had a problem but remember
[1:53:55] david prophesied he said today
[1:53:58] i'll take your head off
[1:54:00] and he did it with whose sword
[1:54:04] he did it with his enemy sword
[1:54:07] he picked that big thing up and he
[1:54:08] whacked that thing's head off
[1:54:11] and guess what
[1:54:12] he became a king
[1:54:15] because he believed what his prophet
[1:54:16] said let's stand
[1:54:18] one more quote this is the last one i'll
[1:54:20] leave you with this one
[1:54:22] brother brown i'm saying the statue of a
[1:54:24] perfect man
[1:54:25] 1966 62
[1:54:28] and i want you to take it
[1:54:31] and study it
[1:54:34] and compare it and then act upon it
[1:54:38] don't just study it
[1:54:40] compare it but act upon when you act
[1:54:43] upon it when you do
[1:54:45] take it sincerely to yourself don't say
[1:54:48] well i enjoyed listening at it
[1:54:51] i did too
[1:54:52] but to listen at it and then receiving
[1:54:55] it is different see it's different
[1:54:58] that's my commission to you
[1:55:00] do not just
[1:55:02] listen and say i enjoyed that i want us
[1:55:05] to act on it
[1:55:06] i want us all to come to a place
[1:55:10] that we come
[1:55:13] to right there
[1:55:17] and then god
[1:55:19] can say whatever
[1:55:22] you say
[1:55:23] i'll back it up
[1:55:25] because you know what when we take a
[1:55:26] body change who you know we can sit
[1:55:28] there and say it all day brother dick my
[1:55:30] body's changing my body's change but one
[1:55:31] day
[1:55:32] when you say my body's changed god's
[1:55:35] gonna say that's exactly what i was
[1:55:37] thinking
[1:55:46] got to bring it together because
[1:55:48] remember somewhere
[1:55:50] he's eternal
[1:55:52] he's already said it
[1:55:54] he knows who's going to come to it but
[1:55:57] we don't
[1:55:58] so like i said i'm just dumb enough to
[1:55:59] believe it's me
[1:56:00] right
[1:56:01] don't call me dumb
[1:56:05] i'm just dumb enough to believe thank
[1:56:07] god for these people that can play and
[1:56:08] look at these people here these brothers
[1:56:10] that can they can sing but listen god's
[1:56:12] got a bride
[1:56:14] he's got a david that'll believe what
[1:56:16] that prophet said
[1:56:18] know that that special anointing is on
[1:56:21] him now it doesn't make you a special
[1:56:22] person it's a special anointing on the
[1:56:24] person
[1:56:25] if you think you're a special person
[1:56:27] you'll never get this special anointing
[1:56:29] but if you get the special anointing
[1:56:31] god's going to do what he's going to
[1:56:34] manifest through you
[1:56:36] what he's always wanted because the
[1:56:38] whole world is waiting on the
[1:56:39] manifestation of sons
[1:56:41] and daughters that's right
[1:56:43] of god let's sing a song thank you for
[1:56:45] listening to this um
[1:56:48] statue of a perfect man i've really
[1:56:49] enjoyed it
[1:56:51] you could expound on it more but you
[1:56:53] know what
[1:56:54] may the holy spirit fill in all the gaps
[1:56:57] may the god of glory fill in all the
[1:56:59] gaps that i left

[2:01:30] we know that brother dale's going to
[2:01:32] have surgery or not surgery but he's
[2:01:34] going to have
[2:01:35] some procedures done to his heart so
[2:01:37] brother al
[2:01:38] is i'm agreeing with him
[2:01:40] let's just all gather around around the
[2:01:42] pulpit around here everybody come here
[2:01:44] much all everybody sisters brothers
[2:01:47] children
[2:01:49] i don't care whoever you are just come
[2:01:50] on over here
[2:01:53] everybody all the way from the back to
[2:01:55] the front
[2:02:08] whether it's my natural daddy or not
[2:02:10] he's my spiritual father in the gospel
[2:02:12] he's all of our spiritual god father in
[2:02:15] the gospel and i'll absolutely remind
[2:02:18] you of one thing
[2:02:20] that
[2:02:21] the toil that it takes on a man's heart
[2:02:25] and body because remember we all still
[2:02:28] live come on up here come on get up here
[2:02:30] as far as you can come on
[2:02:32] um
[2:02:33] up here's where the fire falls
[2:02:35] amen
[2:02:37] but he's give his life
[2:02:40] for all of us
[2:02:41] he would give his physical life for all
[2:02:43] of us that's true and remember we're
[2:02:45] still under the curse our body god can
[2:02:48] take care of every bit of us but until
[2:02:49] we come to a place
[2:02:51] of the body change i'm talking about
[2:02:53] we're going to get older we're going to
[2:02:55] have aches and pains our heart's going
[2:02:57] to run out or all these things are going
[2:02:58] to happen to us so we still live under
[2:03:00] the curse
[2:03:02] but
[2:03:03] we know a god that's made all this body
[2:03:06] and he can change things but if you
[2:03:08] remember jesus he looked 50 years old
[2:03:10] when he was 30. you look at brother
[2:03:11] brown and brother i'm 55. brother
[2:03:13] branham was 56 when he got killed he
[2:03:15] looked about 70
[2:03:17] because of what the toil and stress on
[2:03:19] his body because of what he gave he
[2:03:22] literally gave his life
[2:03:24] so that we can have this message
[2:03:26] and brother dale is almost literally
[2:03:28] give his life so he can bring the
[2:03:29] message to us pure
[2:03:31] and adulterated
[2:03:33] i don't know anybody else that has they
[2:03:34] surely are but
[2:03:36] i don't know anybody else
[2:03:38] so we're going to bind right now
[2:03:40] together as a church family yes sir and
[2:03:43] he got a prayer cloth this morning but
[2:03:44] we're going to say a special prayer
[2:03:47] that god would just touch him
[2:03:49] like he said let the people do what they
[2:03:51] want to do but hey it's just lying
[2:03:53] vanity
[2:03:55] but we're going to pray that god will
[2:03:57] anoint him on tuesday when he goes
[2:03:59] and that all things will be well
[2:04:01] listen
[2:04:03] he
[2:04:04] has been ordained to lead us through
[2:04:07] and until god's finished with him he's
[2:04:08] going to but you know what god knew we'd
[2:04:11] do this
[2:04:13] god didn't god didn't god it's not a
[2:04:14] surprise that what brother al said god
[2:04:17] knew we would bind together
[2:04:18] from before the foundation of the world
[2:04:20] he knew we'd do this
[2:04:22] now the devil may be surprised but
[2:04:24] that's okay
[2:04:26] that's a good thing that's right because
[2:04:28] he
[2:04:29] i don't care if he gets surprised don't
[2:04:31] bother me
[2:04:32] but god didn't know that
[2:04:34] i mean god knew that yeah brother sam's
[2:04:35] paid prayed for every one of us even
[2:04:37] before some of you were born he prayed
[2:04:39] for your parents
[2:04:41] so let's pray for him and pray
[2:04:44] not just a simple prayer pray in earnest
[2:04:46] prayer
[2:04:47] talk to god just like just like i said
[2:04:49] just like he's your daddy he is your
[2:04:50] daddy
[2:04:51] daddy daddy you know what let's drop
[2:04:53] down be children let's let's drop down
[2:04:54] be children but let's be adults in our
[2:04:56] heart
[2:04:57] to ask god so let's all bow our heads
[2:04:59] pray in your own way
[2:05:00] and when you're finished we'll be
[2:05:02] dismissed all right dear heavenly father
