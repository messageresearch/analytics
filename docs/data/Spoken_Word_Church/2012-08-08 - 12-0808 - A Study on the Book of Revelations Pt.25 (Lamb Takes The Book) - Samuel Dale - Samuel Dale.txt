Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he s and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who be record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand uh now we go to First Peter 1:9 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesy of the grace that should come unto you churching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ Christ which was in them and signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into wherefore G up the loins of your mind and be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing we had a a u word sent into us that we need to pray uh that brother uh Royal Serano uh the flooding is in the Philippines real bad and there's some pictures back there that it says it actually the first floor of his home and I'm 99% sure I've been there when I saw the picture and the bottom floor of his home is totally flooded and uh so it's raining real bad there you know and all and and they're here and cannot contact their two daughters so just pray that the Lord will move the rain out and make everything you know be okay they' say they've already had over 50 casualties in the last 2 or 3 days from the strong rain so remember that the Lord would would be with with them and take care of them amen right now we've tried to bring things down Sunday afternoon to kind of a uh show you an overall view of what we're talking about and all and you know kind of line up some things to where we can move on a little bit and you know I want to make sure tonight we're not going to use any I may quote a good bit but we're not going to use any quotes we want to just go with the service and try to to speak without having to uh pull up a bunch of quotes and things but to get you to see what we're talking about amen all right now we went through in our studies of Revelations 4 and brought it over to the place you know then to go into now into chapter five and going into chapter five we have found some things to be there to help us to understand that's right and and I pray that the Lord would would would open their eyes to one thing now it's it's you know I've gotten some comments back so I know that most people haven't never maybe thought of the situation that I brought out there Sunday morning in the afternoon service right of the book being written and then sealed up right because most everybody wants to try to break it open it see it you know understand it but if you wasn't here I ask you to please listen to the morning and the evening service this past Sunday all right but see the book is sealed amen right the prophet said you're sealed with the book right right amen now you say well how do it sealed now now there's some things about this book this Bible that we're holding up that's that man was able to be able to read and understand like the Fai of the fathers the writing of the word Etc but then the Book of Revelations comes into view and it just kind of seals up the book right to where that you you've got to have an understanding then of a sealed book right a lot now if you'll notice in your reading we'll get to it in a few minutes uh in three places in chapter 5 alone it speaks of a sealed book you know and chapter 5 we know is to be already the bride in glory after the WAP rure amen right Y and the book is still sealed right see because you've got to get that understanding to be able to walk into the rest of the scriptures all right but see the book is sealed you say yes but but uh you know and I said there are some parts of the book that was not what you call sealed up right y but just remember that the Bible is sealed to unbeliever right amen right that's right that's right y all right do you you follow that amen it takes a baptism of the Holy Ghost to be able to understand the Bible right now you can read you can study it that's fine and we do that but the Holy Spirit has to reveal amen and we're talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ and see then we know that the Bible said just paraphrase it that no man can call Jesus the Christ you know the Christ accept it be by what right by the baptism of the holy spirit all right see because you can't understand you can't see the book you see can't see the kingdom of God without the new birth right amen all right so it's sealed up now so remember now the book is sealed up the that mankind can't read this Bible that's right and understand it right amen because it's sealed until you get the Holy Spirit now also remember this and keep it in your mind I'll repeat it in a minute but see until this time there in Corinthians the Bible says that there's a blindness over Israel's eyes right amen that they cannot see it's over their heart really right because they can't see it right and see that's what we're talking about see then we begin to talk about in The Book of Revelations you don't see the book in chapter 4 you see one on the throne You See Redemption you see all the things and the bride goes up in Revelations 41 not seen until 1921 right you know coming back all right the rest is to Israel see then that's the point we're trying to get across to you to be able to see but you see you the book is sealed am and we gave it to you paragraph like 75 of the seal book the book is sealed and you're sealed with the book amen right see you're the book right see we're not talking about the one that's in the hand of the one on the throne is not a scull field thps and chain or whatever Bible right amen the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne we' read it to you the prophet there's nothing in it but a book of names amen right see it's a book of names because it was the names that was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen right so it's just names written in that book amen all right but see then when we came to Earth then this Bible here is The Book of Life right amen because this Bible here then tells what going on on Earth while that name is being made manifest that was in the Lamb's Book of Life Amen brother said arm and Neville is not written in the Bible but he said what's going on on Earth while arm and Nevil is here right he said that puts him right in the word amen right all right see then we don't look in the word to try to find our names right we look into the word to see what's going on man yes all right now the emphasis I've been trying to make for quite a while is one thing that book that you are is not completed yet no that's right amen well because we're not completely yet right right right right am see we're in the journey amen we're in the process all right now being in the process being in the Journey the book is being written ye are written Epistles Paul said known and read of all man but see when you come to the Book of Revelation chap 5 the bride's already gone up to glory in chapter 4 right right so she's already become the book she's already become a Britain epistle that's right she's already become a live word that's what we're doing right now right is receiving the word of God and becoming that word just as we eat and become the food that we eat and see then looking at it then see we are sealed the world can look at you and they can say to the about the sisters and they say well you know you're different right you look like the word all right right but still they can't see him right right you remember brother R saying said you can't see me right he said you see the body I inhabit right but you can't see me right now so is it that I said a moment ago then that we are that book amen you're a walking book right you're a living book amen the book is now being written about you and I amen there's things in this Bible that's not fulfilled yet you agree right amen all right now if it's written in this book by somebody by prophecy like Paul said we be changed the moment the twinkle an eye now that hadn't taken place yet right right if it has you and I missed it all right but see it's not taking place yet all right so then the book is not complete all right man see now the book I'm talking about Adam didn't have a Bible in his hand we were doing Pary and my wife and I were talking about these things and she helps me to try to get me to back to the CH the chain of thinking and what we ought to bring out and you know and I appreciate that you see Adam never had a Bible in his hand he didn't have a book in his hand no right but he didn't have a book he didn't have the the lounge Book of Life holding it in his hands no no but what he had was was the ability to bring forth all of those names amen right yes sir right right and had he not sin not entered the picture that's right we would have come spoken word children amen and only the names It Was Written in the lamb Book of Life would have been all that would have come right right but but because that we didn't go that way and send into picture then there's a lot more names going to be involved and then a book had to be starting to be written y right according to the Book of Daniel according to the Book of Revelation it calls them books right Prophet says there's even a book about your life right but this Bible tells us enough about our life right right that's right see this Bible has covered every age and time that will ever be upon the Earth is written right here in this Bible amen all right but that's the Book of Life man to show you what you're doing or a record of what you're doing and it recorded on the day of Pentecost that the baptism of the Holy Ghost came and how many received that what were they their names had to be on that L's Book of Life right right but it's not that Adam was sitting with the book and lost it he lost the ability for it to come forth amen and God had to take it back right all right and brother around said then we see him sitting here with that book in his hand amen so the book that I'm talking about is in the hand of the one sitting on the throne in Revelations 51 right it's not a Bible you can call it a Bible because it's the book of life but it's a record of those names right that would receive Jesus Christ as their savior amen amen but it's not a record of the Jews it's not a record of the of the foolish virgins M and the thing it's only a record of those names is only the bride right see then when Jesus Christ paid the price then he went to the throne right all right you remember we went through chapter 4 he raised up and went to the throne amen all right brother said climbed up on the throne and set down in other words became the one on the throne amen that's what happened at Calvary but he didn't claim The Possession that's right on the entire being at Calvary right he only claimed the possession of the soul of the individual amen all right now he's not going to have to get back up on the throne and die again to claim the rest of us he paid the price amen it just wasn't made manifest at that time right see then what started was it started on Earth y just like I said a moment ago no man can see the kingdom the kingdom of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost into our hearts and lives right amen all right be in that Kingdom when you and I came into that Kingdom by the new birth that brought that name that was before the foundation of the world it made it manifest on earth right might not be G Atkins or crany want right because it's their name that was written before the foundation of the world right but there's a manifestation on Earth of that individual see both of them the in are made manifest here on Earth and accepting the new birth then God's predestination would catch up with you right and see then you would be here in as a born again believer right that's the writing of the book amen see until all of those names in that L's Book of Life have been made manifest upon Earth in individuals who have received the new birth then the book is not complete amen I gave you quotes over and over where the Prophet would say when the book is completed you know what happens to the book it's sealed up that's right amen so if you can see that people can't even see you that's right they see the body you inhabit they see your life your actions your doings and that's why it's so important yep how we live amen all right but they can't see that Christ in you because that Pharisee was just as religious sure as to look upon him the Pharisee would have been more religious of what we think of religion than what Jesus was even sure right but we know that what was it he was an actor right amen word Pharisee actor see all right but you see once that last name comes in here on Earth and is made manifest by the new birth you understand what I'm saying not just because it comes on earth right but it's got to receive the new birth amen all right and when it does the book is completed right and it's sealed up because what I want you to think about the statements brother R made that we sometimes don't you know honor them as much as I think as we need to but brother R said here in Revelations 5 he said the book is closed amen that's right he said we didn't know it was a seal book that's what he said I said the seal I gave it to you he said we didn't know it was a sealed book he said but we found it's a sealed book the book is sealed up it's not open until chapter n chapter 10 you find him with a book in his hand open you don't find him in chapter 5 with that book open why right because this book in Revelations 5 is you and you're sealed up just like you're sealed up here but they can't see it right m they can see the life that you manifest yeah but they can't see Christ right unless the Holy Ghost comes through that person to make Christ manifest right right so then the books got to be sealed why because it's got to go to Israel as a sealed book right right come on yep that's right sure Israel at this time the book is seed amen right yep they can't see Jesus Jesus Christ right right they know all about him sure they could probably tell you more about him in a lot of things than even the lot of the religious world that claim to be Christians but in doing that see it's sealed up right you are the book right that I've been talking about in the hand of the one sitting on the throne cuz you don't see the book in chapter 4 I went through that over it and over it amen you see the throne and one on the throne the elders and the the rainbow and the things showing the Rapture has taken place right but you don't see the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne in chapter 4 right it's in chapter 5 right why because he's fixing to take that book amen and he's going to preach you to Israel amen amen I don't see why people can't see that that's right amen we're not going to Israel as I've said some even believe that we're going to go to Israel ourselves some in the message say a gentile prophet and a gentile bride you know of course I knew the brother meant he was the Gentile Prophet but it didn't make no difference I didn't believe we're not going to get up the plane fly to Israel and then go out to Rapture and we ain't going to fly up and go over and go down you know and no no but this man message which is the Bible amen right you agree brother R's message is the Bible this message will go to Israel this book will go to Israel not a not a book like this right but they will tell Israel right right you rejected the right of sunship right you would not receive Jesus Christ as your savior right we said the Gentiles did and they have this whole New Testament now is written that you can read what they done right yes and they can tell us that and they went in the Rapture and you rejected the right of sunship I was looking at something today cuz my wife will remember this I told her I said there something something somebody said about him singing a new song and I couldn't get that straight now I know where it's at see in Revelations five the bride sings a new song right but in Revelation 14 Israel sings a new song after they're redeemed sure absolutely amen about 143 I think it is I knew it was somewh word and I couldn't place it and I kept searching then all at once it appears yeah all right see we sing a new song Amen you say yeah but we've always sung the song of redemption that's right but our song of redemption if you ever noticed your songs notice your song books Charles Wesley and them all wrote the songs right during that period of time a lot of people that time you know there was written about the blood is that right why because that was what being was being preached it was being preached so strong until they believed you were saved by the blood right yeah there's no way to be saved by the blood cuz the chemistry can't be applied you're saved by the life that's in the blood right amen but you see there are songs actually sing those song We sang them right here I know it was the blood I know it was the blood and it were written in the time of the blood right they was being preached of sanctification ausa Street struck right what is the songs one of them now that may come on down later in our day but just get my idea of what what I'm saying they wrote songs about about the Oneness of the godhead right after isus the street that's right y cuz that was the message that was being preached what are the songs now written by the people of the bride of Christ beautiful songs of the token of the different things what because it's the hour amen even the song shows the time that we're at right amen are you are you following me amen see but we're going to sing a new song Amen you said we just want to sing the songs of redemption now we're going to sing a new song yeah we'll get through that in a minute we're going to sing a new song not something different right but a song related to where we at then when we leave out of here Israel will sing a new song but be real careful the way you place it CU we sang the new song that thou H has made us Kings and Priests right under our God Amen Israel sings only thou Hast redeemed us right I get time I'll get to that scripture in a minute it's on over the message to show you the difference I don't get to it you read uh Revelations 59 and 10 and then you read Revelation 141 through about three they sing a new song Amen y because you see they can't sing the song of Salvation like that that's right they can sing only the song of redemption you say what the same no it's not Redemption can be a a a why why thrown judgment foolish virgin is redeemed one day but she can't sing the song of redemption that we can sing right cuz they don't know anything about our God and our savior are you listening see the book that went back back there was the book of names yep right but the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne if you want to to call it that it's the Bible cuz it's Bible is the Book of Life right brother R will call it the Bible cuz it's the book of life right amen but in this book of life there also a lot of bad things you know what it does it tells you all about how dirty you are right Paul said in such were some of you some of us amen that's right but I like what he sung a new song cuz he said but now we're clean washed amen Washed by the blood amen see this Bible then shows you the natural life that we're living amen but it shows also the eternal life that is dwelling on Earth cuz here's Peter James John that's those names that were written in that book of life before the foundation of the world you know but then their lives at here even to Peter D doubting and problems but you know it was before his new birth right you don't find any doubting in Peter after his new birth made manifest you find him ready to give his life for the gospel but do you see what I'm talking about you see what I've been trying to say I know it's confusing when I come out and say hey everybody's been talking about opening the book book this book that they don't even know how the book got sealed okay how did the book in Revelations 5 get sealed whatever kind of book you want to make it right whatever you want to call it or what it is how did it get sealed cuz it is sealed yeah but we know the seals brother there we know all about seals yeah listen church I know I've made Mass confusion When people's minds are saying one thing the sealed of the literal happening of those seals is to Israel amen the revelation of those seals is to the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't want to be around here when the six seal breaks to you cuz you'd be in the tribulation right right amen well that's what they thought brother around and was saying right when you get over to the Feast of the trumpets like the brother said said he made so many slips of the tongue that it can't be understood brother R gets over there and he says see here he said there's a seven a in a seventh angel Mal for he says to come between the sixth and seventh seal well now if it comes between the sixth and seventh seal that'll put him in the tribulation if that's all you know right he said well brother Dale the seal is broke to the bride amen amen but are we there where they are to make be made manifest you better not be there when that first one is cuz that was the only question they asking does second Thessalonians the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God is that the first heal he said yes so you better not be there for that you better be there where that God takes the seal off and reveals to you but the things is taking place I don't want to be where they're at I want to be where the revealing is at this is the revealing of the book amen while the book is being written about you and I it's being revealed right we are the revealed book yeah that's right we are the word of God that's being made manifest we are that book amen that's in the hand of the one sitting on the throne Lord and then he can take what's there and he's got a book to go to Israel y right right exactly you remember we brought it out Sunday trying to to show where the prophet of God even was confused on that Fifth Fifth chapter because when he answered that question right is that the Saints he says no that is not the Saints he said they're not redeemed he said that's the elders and the the beasts and things but he's done forgot that he's in heaven right he's thinking that's some Redemption for Earth chapter 4 and five is in heaven amen yep the bride already in glory right she's the book that's what I'm tried to explain to you that's right and then I ask you a simple question I know that is fensive to people could he take your Revelation and convert to Jews right M right well I don't really know where there's one God or three you know kind of look like it's three sometimes sometimes maybe there's four or five I don't really know is it important for me to know yes that's what everybody says right once you start talking to anybody that's the first thing you think we need to know this all we need to know is Jesus Christ died for our sins that's it well go right over there and join that church cuz that's what he preaches every Sunday I'm not sarcastic I'm telling the God's honest truth you don't go to a Baptist Church and hear them preach that salvation comes by believing in some hudo they preach it comes by believing in Jesus Christ right but then the scripture says no man can call him the Christ unless it's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right could he take your Revelation and show Israel one God that's right now you see why did I spent 40 something years preaching one God y could he take your revelation of one God and converted you that's right brother R was listening to him the other day he said them Jews can show you where that Trinity come from y he said they can tell you all of these things because they studied it so that's why you can't cut God in three pieces and give him to a Jew now how could you take the doctrines in this message and go to Israel that's right two Lords Two Souls River Jordans you know God not god Till The River Jordan all these things you see why it's not going to work they've tried to do it right I'm not TR to explain there have churches in Israel right today that are following this message sure but is that going to convert the Jews well how come it won't convert back come come on right all you got to do is get the word brother just give him the books now You' seen the ladies is coming on all these things after the guy you know jumped up that brother R was out there at the wrong time hunting and all this that and other now this big things on the Blasted on the internet around the world showing the fallaces of brother rand's message you don't have them as copy in my office see everybody's getting on the bandwagon now church we don't see the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God and in a literal extent Israel sees that of the breaking of the Covenant but we see him sitting now amen now in the people of this message because the greatest and the closest to the truth is where the Antichrist can be the greatest that's right yes sir so you think that I'm hateful for talking about those things no I'm trying to warn you just don't get caught with them I just simply ask you the question cuz your Revelation converted you amen and I don't mean this wrong but how many of your mannerisms and conversation and life and things has converted people to this message right amen right sorry I shouldn't be that a it's true but one not it's the truth amen the prophet said your life is so loud I can't hear your words right oh that's for them other people no a live life is a greater book than any book any talk you can do with your lips amen right all right let me get off there and get back do you see what I'm talking about right let's just read go ahead brother Joe pull up Revelations 5 we got him in the office all bicep t i cuz I told him going have nothing but a few scriptures let these other brothers rest but I want you to notice how many times he talks of a sealed book right well now what kind of a book is it what what what's wrong here we've done gone up in the Rapture what kind of a book is it yep and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals that's all the people ever deal with is it on the inside or is it on the outside we can't figure that out we can't figure that out whether it's inside or outside we got quotes from R around that sealed on the the inside and sealed on the outside yeah but you better carry that all the way through until you find him saying you can't add one word to the book right no right I tried to explain that years ago but how many of you remember it there's not Seven Seals on the outside of the book there's not seven Thunders on the outside of the book Daniel heard the Thunders right they're in the book John heard the Thunders they're in the book yeah but he had a quote from Brother brandom the Thunders is the only thing that's left and they're on the back side of the book now what's he talking about he's done explained to you it's not a book like this right he's done explained it's not this that it Scrolls and things right why can't you remember that get away from a book but once you get down to a point of thinking that book is a book of names and it's sealed up until those names are revealed until it's revealed amen it's not written inside and on the backside writing why don't you just get simple weird thinking everybody wait that this a simple statement I've made for 40 years then the book that is written is sealed by The Book of Revelations it's not outside the book right be outside the book you you get your CL sometimes right well it was on the outside till the prophet broke it well did he go outside the book and get his Revelation no come on did he go outside the book and get his Revelation no he didn't do that his Prophet am it had to be what was in the book he said but where light had not shined on what in the Bible had light not shined on right right Peter didn't preach one God water baptism no Eternal Hells and thing right you said no you can't well it's in there in his writings y right but the Book of Revelations has the Bible sealed that's what it seal with on the back it's the last book in the Bible right right there's not another book after The Book of Revelations so that's the backside of the book right y The Book of Revelations it seals the entire book Y and until those seals are broke that's right I'm going to throw you a curve to where you follow one of these days and I get to it when you get to Revelation 61 there's only one seal broke in 61 right so then there's six more so the book ain't opened in Revelation 6:1 it's only part the open right you got to have all of those Seven Seals to be open for the book to be opened right he church so what does he say and I saw a strong Angel proclaimed with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book y though the book's closed Y and to loose the seals thereof seal with the seals no man in heaven no man under the Earth was able to open the book why it's a seal book needed to look there on you couldn't even look at it right what do you mean I can't look at it I I I pick it up and yeah what your Prophet said said you stop at drunk driving down the highway and he saw drunk and you ask him is Jesus Christ God and you say yes he said but he only knows what somebody else said right y it's not a revelation to him no no man in heaven or on Earth neither under Earth was able to open the book neither to look her own and I we much because no man was found worthy to open open open open to a seal and read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders says we not behold the line of the tribe of Judah has Prov Veil to open the book and loose the Seven Seals brother Rand couldn't do that cuz no man in heaven no man on Earth brother Rand said Moses was there Elijah was there he said all of them that had died in Christ was there there's no man worth it so don't holler say brother R was worthy he's the one that's just told us he's not worthy that's right but get what I'm talking about he's prevailed he's overcome so he can open the book he can lose the seals right the land so in Revelation 61 it says and the lamb opened the first seal second one it says and the lamb opened third fourth now it don't get down on over there about 5 and 6 and say the lamb opened the fifth seal but you got enough sense to know what's going on so don't be a you know what reason I get that I I know what goes in people's mind well ain't no Lamb on the for and F or something like that boy look at the Revelation on water yeah and behold low in the midst of the throne the Elder still is a lamb he had seven horns and seven eyes which is seven spirits of God it's like we said now what kind of lamb is it y That's not talking about Calvary he never had seven horns and seven eyes at Calvary no that's right right this is the end time right when the book is sealed up only after the book is sealed up does a lamb appear with seven horns and seven and I and all right we put message after message to do prove what where did the lamb come from right did we not read that it came from the church ages cuz those horns and eyes are The Messengers and the ages go back in chapter one and read it'll tell you that right where did this lamb come from what's he doing in the end time he's fixing to go to Israel yep right he's going to take those seals off that book and go to Israel amen cu the next Redemption is Israel and chapter 5 we're in heaven man right simple everybody says I'm so deep but what is it simple look and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him to set upon the throne he took the book now brother around I gave them to you it's on souls and prison and uh who do you say this is is two different quote that brother around said he took the book climbed up on the throne and said I am yeah all right so that's what he's referring to he took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne right see we look at like two people when they got no he took the book he come to the position the book in him was one he walks upon on the throne and sits down who the lamb the lamb that has seven horns and seven eyes right CLS up on the throne and sits down the prophet said it like this he said he become the one on the throne right as your Revelation put him back on the throne right or do you still have wonders about Trinity or what this is or what that well brother so so explain it's so beautiful yeah like that brother that had that big thing and had the screens of it and everything you know and everybody just went haywire he had it all draw out where this great Pillar of Fire went up here and went over here and come down down over here and he just raced this out that's where he first messed up y because brother ROM never said all God like all that we think was poured into Christ because there was a part of Christ that was not made manifest until the Book of Revelation right look and when he had taken the book The Four beasts Anders fell down for the lamp having every one of them hearts and golden vs full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints y now and they who not the lamb not the elders not the the four Beast you see well that was part of it yeah it's part of it but now you're getting into the story mhm the Saints are singing a new song what are they singing see that's where brother Brandon when he answered from here up in his talk but then when he dropped down and read that nin verse he said that is the Bride of Jesus Christ I was fixing I answered that wrong and they sang a new song now watch what is that new song would not that new song be what the prophet of God was saying when he said when the seals broke it become a brand new book is that what he said not a different book right not something different from the song you were singing about the blood you finally see as a prophet would say you're not saved by by the blood see Luther w i mean Wesley and all them thought you were saved by the blood little said you're not saved by the blood he said you're saved by the life that was in the blood he said you're kept saved by the blood CU it's on the throne see then you're moving up right amen it's opening up singing a new song and watch the worthy to take the book amen and to open the seals now it didn't say he did right there no you find in chapter 5 one worthy to take the book and what the book is chapter six is when the lamb opens the first SE get it in correct order read it in correct order look why they sing a new song dark worthy to take the book and open the seal there for thou was slain who was slain the lamb Christ right and has redeemed us amen that's it to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and Nation like way said the other day see then that can't be Israel n because they're not redeemed out of every Kindred Nation they're redeemed out of Israel they may be living in every nation and Kingdom but they're not in that that are not that's not them they're Jews amen that's right listen has redeemed us to God out of every k and hath made us unto our God Kings and Priests and shall reign on the earth amen that's it remember what it says there so keep looking at that chapter 4 14 and I looked and L lamb stood on the mount s and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in their forehead look what's already happened to them and I heard Heard a Voice from Heaven as the voice of many Waters and the voice of a great Thunder and heard the voice of Hearts harping harping with their hearts and they sang as it were a new song Before the Throne yeah watch their song now remember their song you made us priests and Kings right you redeemed us watch what their song is and they sang as it were right and you song see because they they couldn't sang it before before son Before the Throne and before the four Beast and the elders and no man could learn that song right listen right but the 144,000 which were redeemed from the Earth all it says that they're redeemed nobody can't sing that song but the 144,000 no man can't sing this song that we're looking at in Revelations 5 right where he's made us priest and King nobody can sing that the Jews can't sing that right amen cuz they don't come after sunship right you don't understand what that prophet he answered that question there in the questions and answers on the seal he said that is not the Saints right now what if God had not stopped him that's right there's only two redemptions in the Bible That's Right 144,000 and a bride that you're dealing with yep so he would have been saying that was Israel y well that's okay we're over in fourth chapter see that's how silly people are right if he made that Israel we can't say that we're priests and Kings Israel would be the priests and the Kings cuz they would be singing that song we wouldn't even have a song to sing right right that's right we wouldn't have anything to shout about when you get on down in the further in the fifth chapter we wouldn't have anything we would all be going to Israel yep and how many years have I tried my best to preach to you one thing in the Old Testament there was no eternal life as a possession except Adam that's right amen Adam was the only one in the Old Testament that talks about having eternal life amen that's right nobody else had eternal life well where are they going brother D they going to be given eternal life right that's why they a singing you s cuz remember there's more than just 144,000 right there is a fifth seal Jew that can cover a lot of people yes sir Y and they can sing that song of Israel but they can't sing what the 144,000 can sing right you know the 144,000 can't be nothing but Unix to the bride right y that's what your Prophet said right the Plan of Redemption but do you see what I'm talking about Revelations 5 we are that book that's going to be taken to Israel amen that's sure is our revelation of almighty God God brought To Us by the prophet of God and don't you misunderstand me on what I'm saying those things without him bringing it to you and I wouldn't have it no amen but you can't make him God right he's a member of the body of Christ amen that's right amen don't you think them true prophets is not going to tell them that the Jews that the Gentiles received a gentile prophet and they're going to explain the five times of Elijah abolutely they got three and a half years to preach yeah that's right right when you read it it looks like we go up when the next day all Israel Sav no there three and a half years of preaching right that's right amen amen they will tell them all about what's happened to you and I right they'll tell them about Elijah number one Elijah Elisha number two John the Baptist number three of the coming of Elijah and brother random number four of the coming of Elijah amen and they'll be standing there and look at number five y right right right amen you know what's the worst thing of it how are they going to see they say to those two prophets come on you want the Bible sure they say where did you get the nail prints in you hand right you two prophets won't be standing there with nail prints in their hands come on they'll be preaching about Calvary that's right right they'll be preaching about Calvary if Calvary he could show the nail prints in his hand right but look folks when they see his wife that's what I Tred to get across Sunday Joseph you think he was more interested in his daddy than he was his wife Joseph loved his daddy loved his brothers right he done set that b before him and they did you think he was interesting you think he went home with Daddy well Daddy I'm going home with you don't you have a wife and some kids yeah that's over with I'm with my daddy now I love my daddy I love my daddy too but he's not my wife right right I love my children I love my grandchildren and my great grandchildren but they are not my wife right that's right my wife is a part of me right you remember this this dream I had and woke up that in the dream I was going down the road saying and fill my way every day with love as I walk with the Heavenly do and I woke up and I Heard a Voice was singing feel my way every day with love I kept listening thinking am I still asleep or am I way and I thought well I know I'm awake and I heard it my wife was in the other room singing feel my way how did she know to sing the song at the time I was dreaming about it cuz you see we're one Joseph was more concerned about his wife sure than he was his daddy and his brothers all right God loves his children of Israel sure right mhm he died for him but who you think he loves now right amen they rejected the right of being his wife right Y come on y but the Gentiles accepted it right amen by us accepting Jesus Christ then we can fulfill the complete Plan of Redemption CU we can sing a new song y amen when you're in chapter 5 you can sing I'm redeemed my love divine Glory Glory Christ is mine everything I got I went to him amen sir right right see Paul now if you understand I going just say this in quick Paul Could Sing of the Redemption right Peter James John they could sing Redemption right now see if you catch on to the stories I was trying to tell you how the songs were written about the blood in the days of Wesley this was what I was talking about those disciples could sing the song of redemption but they can't sing what we can saying right right right they can only sing I'm redeem waiting Redemption come on they without us cannot be made perfect so they can only saying I'm redeemed in Soul but my body is still here right I got problems with it but that bride in Revelations 5 stands there totally Eternal totally Eternal Body Spirit and soul thank you that's a new song Amen thank you Lord what about it anybody got any questions am I confusing you I don't want to confuse you I want it to be clear you see the book I'm talking about is sealed up is you and I amen that's right that's right this Bible has been sealed a whole time y this Bible sealed to an unbeliever this Bible is sealed to a Jew he can only read the Old Testament part brother R said the old only speaker than you that's right see but they can't understand Redemption they're worried about the nail prints when he makes itself known to them they go to themselves for because they see they rejected Messiah m y sure do now listen to what I'm saying when them 144,000 sees the nail prints in his hands they know he died at Calvary right right they know that's talking about Jesus because he's not seeing them in physical he seen him through the two prophets right all right but when they see they turn down that Messiah ship and we accepted it they go to themselves and weep because they know they turned it down and ain't a bunch of Gentiles say well bless God I'm saved I tell you what you can't tell me I ain't saved when Jesus Christ is revealed to those Jews that sends them to their knees that's right amen that's right has your Revelation put you on your knees knees anywh or has it lifted your head up that's right and made it so big do you have to distra you I'm Bri you better remember the stories the prophet told about the armor meat packing guy and come looking for a wife amen and he found a little old slave girl it didn't have no clothes worth nothing it was out there washing and taking care of everything where her K folks could go to parties and dress up and she
