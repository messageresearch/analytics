[0:00] that are in your word and together with
[0:01] these precious believers, Lord Jesus. I
[0:04] pray, God, that you'll bless the day,
[0:05] Lord, as we come expecting, Lord God,
[0:07] for the things that you've stored up for
[0:09] us, Lord Jesus. Lord, I pray, God, that
[0:11] you'll just, Lord, be pleased with our
[0:13] worship and the things that are said and
[0:14] done today, Lord God, the songs that we
[0:16] sing, Lord Jesus. Bless us now as as you
[0:19] guide us through these scriptures, Lord
[0:21] Jesus, to give us understanding and
[0:23] help, Lord God. We pray in your name.
[0:26] Amen.
[0:30] So, we uh this morning uh we're going to
[0:32] just kind of uh uh look at a couple of
[0:36] scriptures in in 1 Corinthians 7 that
[0:38] we've been meditating on. Start about
[0:40] verse 21 and read to about verse 23 and
[0:44] and and if we have time, we'll keep
[0:46] going. But um verse 21 says, "Art thou
[0:49] called being a
[0:51] servant? Care not for it? But if thou
[0:54] mayest be made free, use it
[0:57] rather. For he that is called in the
[1:00] Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's
[1:03] freeman. Likewise also, he that is
[1:06] called being free is Christ's servant.
[1:10] Of course, what he's what he's framing
[1:12] up for us is to is to be content with
[1:14] where we are. that um you know if you've
[1:17] got a different a certain vocation or or
[1:20] whatever, you don't necessarily have to
[1:21] change things just to satisfy um you
[1:25] know people to to that you're a
[1:27] Christian or whatever. But um look look
[1:30] at how it's so interesting to meditate
[1:33] on this that that in
[1:35] Christ you're free but you're also a
[1:39] servant. That you're
[1:42] free but you're a prisoner.
[1:45] Now, that's, you know, there's so many
[1:47] things in scripture like that that it's
[1:49] it's uh, you know, like Peter said,
[1:52] there's things that Paul said that we
[1:54] wrestle with. What what what does this
[1:56] mean? So many things in scripture that
[1:58] seem like they they are contrary to one
[2:00] another. And and and I I believe God
[2:03] sets it up like that so that we we must
[2:06] meditate on it. and and sometimes, you
[2:09] know, even things that you almost have
[2:10] to battle out and then God over time
[2:14] will reveal things to you. Look, he's
[2:17] saying you are bought with a price. Now,
[2:19] here's the scripture. I just kind of
[2:20] want to want to belabor the point this
[2:23] morning that ye are bought with a price.
[2:26] Now, now think about what Paul's saying
[2:28] here is that that you are so valuable
[2:31] that the price that was that was uh paid
[2:34] for you is such that that we should we
[2:38] should live our whole lives in regard to
[2:41] that price. You are bought with a price.
[2:44] Not you wasn't you weren't bought just
[2:46] with a
[2:47] quarter. You weren't bought with just uh
[2:51] you know somebody just frivolously toss
[2:53] some money over the counter or
[2:54] something. But you were bought with the
[2:56] blood of God.
[2:59] That God laid down everything in glory,
[3:02] all the angels and everything to come
[3:04] down and pay a price for you so that you
[3:09] would not be servants to men. Now you
[3:13] frame that up too that servants of men
[3:16] is more than just being like a slave to
[3:19] somebody. But you you know in the
[3:21] there's there's two things in the
[3:23] scripture. There's the natural man and
[3:24] the spiritual man. And the natural man
[3:27] has all these intellectual ideas and uh
[3:29] looks at things from a a standpoint of
[3:32] your what the human mind can process.
[3:35] But then there's the spiritual man. And
[3:38] the spirit that the the spirit of God
[3:42] takes you from the the natural man and
[3:45] gives you liberty. And the reason why we
[3:48] have that liberty, the freedom in Christ
[3:50] is because that we have been bought with
[3:52] a cri with a price with the blood of God
[3:55] and like you just heard brother Brandham
[3:57] saying that that you're not saved by the
[3:59] blood. You're kept saved by the blood.
[4:01] You come to God by grace. It's his
[4:03] grace, his free gift to you. But then
[4:06] that blood will keep you. It's an anchor
[4:10] that that paid the price for you so that
[4:12] you could you could have that the same
[4:14] nature, the same uh the same
[4:17] characteristics of God. Now, Brother Ram
[4:20] told a story and without money or
[4:22] without price
[4:24] um about this little boy that was riding
[4:26] home on his bicycle and and and a man
[4:29] and his he was walking with his
[4:30] girlfriend and they started making fun
[4:32] of him for going to Sunday school and
[4:35] the little boy went on to Sunday school
[4:38] and uh when he was coming back turned
[4:41] out that man had stepped through the ice
[4:43] and fallen in the ice and he was
[4:45] screaming for help and and brother Ram
[4:48] will tell a story like this. I'm just
[4:49] going to read some paragraph. He said,
[4:50] and we're we're talking about we're
[4:52] talking about how much your life is
[4:53] worth, bought with a price. After a
[4:57] while, over the top of the hill come a
[4:58] little bicycle pedaling a little boy
[5:00] with a a Bible under his arm. He heard
[5:02] the screams and he speeded his little
[5:04] bicycle, laid his Bible down, and ran
[5:07] out on the ice, crawled on his little
[5:09] belly with his good clothes on till he
[5:11] got a hold of the man's arms and kept
[5:13] pulling him back in until he got him off
[5:15] the ice. run out and flagged a car. They
[5:18] called an ambulance and got him to the
[5:20] hospital. After he had went and paid the
[5:22] ambulance, paid the doctors for the
[5:23] pneumonia shots and things that he would
[5:25] have took, he came to the little boy and
[5:28] said, "Son, what do I owe
[5:31] you?" Now, this is a little boy that
[5:33] previously in the day he had told him,
[5:35] "Well, I don't I don't know. I don't
[5:37] want He was making fun of him for going
[5:39] to Sunday school." And now he's saying,
[5:41] "What do I owe you?" He said, "Nothing."
[5:44] He said, 'I owe you my life. Think of
[5:46] it. Money could not pay it. It was his
[5:50] life. And he said, that's the way we
[5:52] ought to feel towards God, not to buy
[5:54] our way through with
[5:57] something. But we owe God our life, for
[6:00] we were dying and sinking in the ditch
[6:03] of sin. God throwed his arms a robe
[6:06] around me. Now, now, isn't that just the
[6:10] way though that people think about the
[6:12] gospel sometimes? is that you've got to
[6:15] owe you owe God like a a list of things
[6:18] that you got to you got to do like I I
[6:21] gotta stop drinking coffee. I gotta stop
[6:23] drinking tea. I got to do this. I got to
[6:25] do that. And you you're looking at it
[6:27] like a you got to pay God back. But God
[6:30] don't want you to pay him back. He wants
[6:33] your heart. He He don't want you to to
[6:35] to to make a list of all the stuff that
[6:38] you got to do to satisfy the
[6:40] requirement. Well, it's it's grace. you
[6:42] you you don't have to do nothing to get
[6:45] it. All you got to do is give him your
[6:47] heart. Amen. And he he don't want all of
[6:49] He don't want your money. He don't want
[6:51] your He He There's There's a long list
[6:54] of things we could roll out of things
[6:55] that God doesn't want or need, but what
[6:58] he wants is your heart, right? And and
[7:00] you think now you you bought with a
[7:03] price. Think about what a great price
[7:05] that was that that that
[7:07] uh he he he could have given his life in
[7:10] a lot of different ways, but it just so
[7:12] happened that God orchestrated it. So at
[7:15] just that season, just that time that
[7:17] crucifixion was the way that people were
[7:19] killed. And crucifixion wasn't just a
[7:22] way to kill. It was a way to break a man
[7:25] completely in body, mind, and spirit.
[7:28] that crucifixion was one of the most
[7:30] brutal, degrading, and excruciating
[7:33] forms of execution ever devised is what
[7:36] history says. Designed not just to kill,
[7:39] but to maximize suffering and shame the
[7:42] victim and send a message of fear and
[7:44] control. Now, for such a price that we
[7:47] could go into all of the thing, all of
[7:48] the things that happened there on the
[7:49] cross, how terrible it was, how how even
[7:52] before the cross, they're laying bare
[7:54] your your nerves and and and and
[7:57] severing ner crushing nerves and things
[7:59] to in a place where you that brings pain
[8:02] that you just can't get away from. It's
[8:04] not like something you can shuffle. You
[8:05] know, when we get a backachche, if we
[8:07] can just get in the right position and
[8:08] you get away from the pain that the
[8:10] crucifixion wasn't like that. It was an
[8:12] inescapable inescapable suffering,
[8:14] inescapable pain of the absolute worst
[8:17] kind. And for such a price as that, we
[8:21] owe him our devotion. We owe him
[8:24] everything. Now, now that's what Paul is
[8:27] trying to frame up that when you're
[8:29] free, the the blood of Christ makes you
[8:33] free, but you're also a servant. You're
[8:37] also a prisoner. And you're not a
[8:40] prisoner by trying to pay God back.
[8:44] You're not a prisoner by trying to
[8:46] satisfy a set of rules. You are prisoner
[8:49] bound by chains of
[8:51] love. It's it's
[8:54] devotion. It's you you're you're a love
[8:57] slave to Christ. Right?
[9:00] Now, you
[9:02] know, Paul referred to him over and over
[9:04] again that to himself that he was a
[9:08] prisoner of Christ, yet he was free. In
[9:11] Ephesians chapter 3, he said, "For this
[9:13] cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus
[9:15] Christ for you Gentiles." In file 1:9,
[9:19] he said, ' Yet for love's sake, I rather
[9:21] beseech thee being such and one as Paul
[9:24] the aged and now also a prisoner of
[9:27] Jesus Christ. And of course, when he
[9:29] wrote some of these words, he actually
[9:31] literally was a prisoner, bound behind
[9:35] prison bars, but but every real true son
[9:39] or daughter of God is is a prisoner.
[9:42] Though you might not be behind bars,
[9:43] you're a prisoner to Christ because
[9:45] you're you're so in love with Christ.
[9:48] And you recognize the price that he paid
[9:50] for you and and everything that he did
[9:52] and the the the the goodness that comes
[9:54] from the gospel that you want to do what
[9:58] he wants. You want to move under the
[10:00] headship of of of Christ. Now, now
[10:02] that's where, you know, you may be the
[10:04] critic or someone could look like like
[10:06] they do. You know, I keep using my
[10:08] daughters. They go out to Chick-fil-A
[10:10] and they got their dresses on and
[10:11] everybody's like, "Well, why do you wear
[10:13] a dress? Why do you wear a hair your
[10:16] hair long?" It must be because you're
[10:19] trying to satisfy a a list of rules or
[10:22] or your what your deacons or your
[10:24] ministers in church or whatever, they're
[10:26] laying out things and they're going to
[10:28] scold you if you don't do it. But you
[10:31] see, that's not what the gospel is at
[10:32] all. A and if we make it like that, if
[10:36] we make it like you're going to get a
[10:38] flogging or a beaten or something if you
[10:40] don't do right, then that's that's
[10:41] really not what the gospel is. The
[10:44] gospel is that God grabs your heart by
[10:46] the word and draws you to himself
[10:49] through love, not and that's that's the
[10:53] freedom, liberty, and Christ is that
[10:56] there ain't nobody making you do it.
[10:59] It's Christ is changing your nature to
[11:02] be like him. Now there's the paradox.
[11:04] You talk about a paradox is that the
[11:06] Christian is both fully free in Christ
[11:10] and fully submitted to his
[11:14] lordship. A prisoner a prisoner of
[11:17] Christ is is not governed by personal
[11:19] ambition or driven by human feelings.
[11:23] Instead, he's bound to Jesus in willing
[11:26] obedience to God's commands.
[11:30] Being a prisoner implies that you're
[11:33] you're laying down your self-will and
[11:36] you're saying, "Lord, not my will, but
[11:38] yours be done." Now, in that what
[11:40] Brother Brandon was just talking about
[11:42] how that that when you're dead, when
[11:44] you're really dead, somebody could call
[11:47] you a hypocrite or label you something,
[11:49] but you're dead. And and so so you're
[11:53] getting your identification not from
[11:55] what somebody says about you or your
[11:57] label, but your identification now is in
[12:00] Christ. And Christ has paid the price.
[12:02] He bought you with the price. So if you
[12:05] have confidence that he's not looking at
[12:06] your mistakes and your failures, but
[12:08] he's looking at you through the blood,
[12:10] then it don't matter what the barbs and
[12:12] things that people throw at you, what
[12:14] people say, but your identification
[12:16] comes from him because you're you're his
[12:19] prisoner. and bondage. It's a bondage
[12:22] that is freely chosen and rooted in
[12:26] love, not compulsion. It's out of
[12:28] devotion, not obligation. The believer
[12:31] has turned over every aspect of life,
[12:34] your
[12:35] plans, your goals, your relationships to
[12:39] God's guiding
[12:40] hand. And that kind of submission bears
[12:43] fruit in day-to-day life. It it
[12:45] eliminates pride. It softens your heart
[12:48] up. And it helps you show genuine love
[12:50] and s service just like Jesus did. Now,
[12:54] now you go back to that script, be not
[12:56] ye the servants of men. Now, isn't it
[13:00] true though that either either God or
[13:02] man is going to be in control? Either
[13:04] you're going to be in control or God
[13:05] will be in control. E you take a
[13:08] denominational system, either it's man
[13:09] in control or God in control. And a
[13:12] prisoner, a prisoner yields his control
[13:15] to God.
[13:17] Scripture says, "Ye are bought with a
[13:20] price. Be not ye the
[13:23] servants of
[13:26] men." Now, and I'm going to I'm just
[13:31] going to read some statements here and
[13:33] and don't forget what we're talking
[13:34] about that it's not coercion that brings
[13:38] you to a place of salvation, but it's
[13:40] God drawing you. Brother Ramman, the
[13:42] rejected king, he said, "Man wants to
[13:44] rule and rule over man." And man wants
[13:48] man to rule over him. He doesn't want to
[13:52] have God to rule. Now, think about the
[13:53] the situation that he's framing up how
[13:55] man wants man wants man wants somebody
[13:58] to rule over them to somebody tell them
[14:00] how to do it. But it's so hard for us to
[14:03] just give our heart to
[14:05] Christ. And St. Augustine and uh his
[14:09] problem was he'd look at Luke 14:23 that
[14:12] says compel them to come in and he
[14:14] believed that coercion was mercy better
[14:17] to save a soul through force than let it
[14:19] be lost in error. He encouraged Roman
[14:22] laws that penalized and restricted
[14:24] worship. And he supported fines,
[14:27] confiscation of property and banishment
[14:29] as tools to suppress heresy. And and all
[14:32] of that led on up into the
[14:34] denominational system that binds through
[14:37] nickelanism where you've got a a cabal
[14:39] of leaders at the top that are separate
[14:41] from the congregation or balamism that
[14:44] says that there's no there's there's
[14:46] compromising there's no difference.
[14:48] denom that denominational prison house
[14:50] that's just a form of power with their
[14:52] false doctrine. And brother Ram would
[14:54] say in God's only provided place of
[14:56] worship. He said out there in Tucson
[14:59] listening in this morning I once
[15:01] wondered I've always constraining people
[15:04] go to church no matter where you go. And
[15:07] I seen the people kind of pulling back
[15:09] and going this way. And I thought what's
[15:11] the matter? I went to some of them the
[15:14] first day you're there. They'll approach
[15:15] you. Join our church. If you don't do
[15:18] it, you're not welcome. See? See? It's a
[15:23] forced thing. It's forced upon you. See?
[15:28] And that's Babylon. But in Christ, you
[15:32] come in by
[15:33] election, not by force. Your heart pulls
[15:38] you in. God did not put his name then in
[15:41] Babylon. Closely now. He cannot put his
[15:44] name in Babylon. The churches. Oh, they
[15:47] they put his name in there, but he never
[15:49] know. In other words, you you don't come
[15:52] to God by the force of man. That's why
[15:55] it's it's not arguments. You could sit
[15:57] across the table with somebody and argue
[15:59] all day long with somebody about what's
[16:01] right and wrong and have have some great
[16:03] compelling arguments, but when God
[16:05] comes, when his spirit moves in, it
[16:07] settles all the arguments. It satisfies
[16:10] all the arguments. It satisfies all the
[16:14] questions. You you can't force anyone to
[16:17] believe. John chapter 6 verse 44 says
[16:20] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[16:24] the father which hath sent me drawing
[16:26] and I will raise him up at the last day.
[16:30] You don't come to God by the force of
[16:32] man. You come to God by the love of God.
[16:36] Now, that means that means if we really
[16:39] understand that that then we can deal
[16:41] with one another knowing that it's not
[16:43] our own efforts that's going to compel
[16:44] somebody to be to be a Christian or to
[16:47] want what you've got, but it's God
[16:49] that's got to get a hold of them. It's
[16:51] God that's got to move. And and I'm
[16:54] going to take a quick detour. I remember
[16:56] um I my own testimony of coming to
[16:59] Christ. I had many many questions and
[17:01] things and my I grew up in the message
[17:03] and where it was laid out before me, but
[17:06] but none of that really did any any
[17:10] uh it's great to grow up in a Christian
[17:12] home, but it didn't matter so much until
[17:15] God got a hold of me. And even watching
[17:18] my own children, you know, they battle
[17:20] things out. They have questions. I
[17:22] remember and I'm just going to I'm going
[17:24] to share I'm going to lay this out. I
[17:25] remember one day my my son, you know, he
[17:27] had a he had he was really battling
[17:29] things out and he came he came to his
[17:32] mother and said, "Well, you know, I just
[17:33] I just don't feel like I care about
[17:36] things anymore. I don't care." And you
[17:38] you know, you can lay things out and and
[17:40] and lay out the the word and lay
[17:42] everything out on the table and put
[17:44] things out before them and live a life
[17:46] and everything, but it's got to be God
[17:48] that gets a hold of them. It's got to be
[17:51] God that moves on the scene. and and
[17:53] then you know that's what you pray and
[17:55] you're patient with them and you you you
[17:57] get alone in your in your prayer chamber
[17:59] and you turn it over to God because
[18:01] there's things that God can do that you
[18:03] can't do just by reasoning and just
[18:05] talking and and and all these all all
[18:08] you know you you do as as well as you
[18:10] can but then when you get to the end of
[18:12] your rope it takes God and you know
[18:16] you've heard you've heard my testimony
[18:17] if he my son's testimony about how that
[18:20] that how that the power of God came on
[18:22] the scene in many different ways to be
[18:25] the witness that that the what we
[18:28] believe is true and and to to satisfy
[18:31] all the questions. And that's what it
[18:33] takes the power of God to satisfy the
[18:36] questions. It takes the power of God.
[18:39] It's not it's not by the force of man.
[18:41] You know, I could put my son in a
[18:42] headlock and try to wrestle him to the
[18:45] bring him to the water and that would
[18:47] not do any good. I I could I could beat
[18:49] him with a stick or something until and
[18:52] try to drive him to the word, but it
[18:54] wouldn't do no good. And that's how the
[18:56] gospel is. You can't come by the force
[18:58] of man. It takes God to do the drawing.
[19:01] Now, aren't you glad that it's like
[19:03] that? No man can come to me except the
[19:07] father which has sent me drawing. So
[19:10] when you get in that state in your heart
[19:12] where you just you you uh now this is
[19:15] how it was for me where I could not get
[19:18] away from it. God begins to draw you and
[19:21] call you and you you can't run away from
[19:24] it.
[19:26] It's like you wake up in the morning and
[19:28] you go to bed at night and it's an
[19:30] allconsuming thought. God is after me.
[19:34] Amen. Now that's when the father begins
[19:36] to draw you. Not because somebody's
[19:38] harping on you and telling you you need
[19:40] to do this or that, but it's God drawing
[19:42] on you. That's why even when you come to
[19:45] church and you hear the preaching, the
[19:47] preaching will go so far, but there's
[19:48] something beyond that when something
[19:51] begins to pulsating in your heart and
[19:53] something begins to draw you and and and
[19:55] woo over your soul like a like a dove
[19:58] over you to know that it's God drawing
[20:01] you. It's not a man that it's God doing
[20:03] it.
[20:06] And that brother Bram said in the church
[20:07] of the living
[20:09] God, excuse me, y'all.
[20:14] He said, "I was born into the world, not
[20:17] by the will of
[20:19] man or not by man, but by the will of
[20:23] God, by divine foreord orordination of
[20:27] God, not by my holiness, I have none."
[20:32] In the message adoption, he said the
[20:34] promise that was given to the church is
[20:37] not a natural land. The promise that we
[20:41] have is not a natural land where you can
[20:44] you it's not a it's not my brain. It's
[20:47] not how much I know how much how much
[20:49] intellectual doctrine and theology I
[20:51] have. The the promise is a spiritual
[20:54] land. The promise is not something that
[20:57] you can be forced into or grappled into.
[21:00] But the promise is something that is
[21:02] spiritual. It's spiritual. When God gets
[21:05] to moving over your heart and moving
[21:07] over the church, it's something that is
[21:09] beyond anything that a natural man can
[21:11] do. It's something that is spiritual.
[21:14] For we are a royal priesthood, a holy
[21:17] nation. Then in this royal priesthood,
[21:20] holy nation, peculiar people called out,
[21:22] elected, chosen, set aside. Then all the
[21:25] world is dead on the outside. And we are
[21:29] led by the
[21:31] spirit. Sons and daughters of God are
[21:34] led by the spirit of God. Not by man,
[21:39] but by the spirit. It's the spirit of
[21:42] God that moves you. It's not some
[21:44] denominational system that's we're a
[21:46] prisoner of, but we are prisoners. We're
[21:49] we're prisoners. We're bound up in
[21:51] Christ by love. that God loved us so
[21:54] much that he gave his own blood for us
[21:56] and we love him so much back that we
[21:58] give our own lives for him and it's not
[22:01] because we were forced into it because
[22:03] God grabbed us by chains of love and he
[22:06] pulled us to himself. It's his love and
[22:10] that look look the natural man will have
[22:12] questions and doubts and fears but the
[22:14] spiritual man is free in Christ. The
[22:18] natural man's going to have all kinds of
[22:20] questions, but the spiritual man answers
[22:23] the questions. That's why you must be
[22:26] born again because Christ is the answer
[22:29] to all the questions. Now, now look, you
[22:31] read the Bible and there's going to be
[22:33] plenty of questions. Why Why do Matthew
[22:35] and Luke have different
[22:38] [Music]
[22:39] lineages? Did Jesus carry his
[22:42] cross? John says that Jesus carried his
[22:45] cross. All the other gospels say Simon
[22:47] Serene, the serene picked it up and
[22:49] carried
[22:50] it. In Acts chapter nine, the man with
[22:53] Paul heard a voice but saw no one. Acts
[22:55] chapter 22, they saw the light but
[22:57] didn't hear the voice.
[22:59] When when was Jesus crucified? Mark says
[23:02] he was crucified at 9:00 a.m. John says
[23:04] he was crucified at noon. Well, there's
[23:07] got to be an answer to that. How How did
[23:09] Jesus die? Matthew says he hanged
[23:11] himself. of Acts says he fell headlong
[23:13] burst
[23:16] open. What did the centurion say in
[23:18] Matthew 27? Truly this was the son of
[23:21] God. In Luke 23 it says certainly this
[23:23] was a righteous
[23:25] man. What did he say? How many women
[23:28] were at the
[23:29] tomb? Was it just Mary Magdalene and the
[23:32] other Mary? Was it Mary Magdalene, Mary
[23:35] the mother of James and
[23:36] Salom? Was it Mary Magdalene Joanna?
[23:39] Mary, mother of James and
[23:41] others. Was it like John said, only Mary
[23:45] Magdalene? There's going to be all kinds
[23:48] of questions when you begin to open up
[23:50] your Bible. There's going to be all
[23:53] kinds of questions when you start diving
[23:54] into what the message really is. There's
[23:57] going to be that question like Jesus
[23:59] asked Peter, "Who do you say that I am?"
[24:05] And the only way to have the questions
[24:07] answered is for Christ to come on the
[24:10] scene. It takes c it took Christ to
[24:13] answer that question for Peter. Who do
[24:16] you say that I
[24:18] am? Who are
[24:20] you? And Jesus said, "Blessed art thou,
[24:23] Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath
[24:25] not revealed it unto thee, but my father
[24:27] which is in
[24:28] heaven." It takes God to do it.
[24:32] Questions are part of the
[24:34] journey, but it takes God to answer the
[24:36] question. It takes God to bring freedom
[24:39] from
[24:40] sin. Oh, to think now this morning that
[24:43] you can be a a prisoner of
[24:46] sin and and then God can come on the
[24:48] scene and make you a prisoner of Christ.
[24:52] And you can make a you can be a prisoner
[24:54] of sin and think you're
[24:55] free. And then the you hear the word and
[24:58] realize you're you're bound up. You're
[25:00] you're more of a prisoner than a
[25:02] prisoner that's behind bars in sin
[25:05] because you're you're you're like the
[25:07] devil's play thing. The devil is just m
[25:12] making you do whatever he wants to do
[25:14] bound up where you you're trying to get
[25:17] liberty and then God comes and and
[25:21] really sets you free where you can have
[25:23] freedom of in your mind. Freedom from
[25:26] the mind battles, freedom from
[25:27] depression, freedom from sin, freedom to
[25:30] live and walk and find your purpose in
[25:33] life. That God can give you real
[25:35] freedom. John chapter 8, Jesus said,
[25:39] "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[25:40] whosoever committh sin is the servant of
[25:44] sin." And we'll stop on this as the
[25:47] musicians come. And the servant abideth
[25:50] not in the house forever, but the son
[25:52] abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall
[25:55] make you free, you shall be free
[26:00] indeed. Further up in that chapter, he
[26:02] said, as he spoke these words, and many
[26:04] believed on him, then said Jesus to
[26:06] those Jews which believed on him, if you
[26:08] continue in my word, then are you my
[26:11] disciples
[26:12] indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and
[26:15] the truth shall make you
[26:17] free. And the truth is not just
[26:20] doctrines and theologies, but the truth
[26:23] is the word made
[26:24] alive. The gospel is that kind of truth
[26:30] will make you free from
[26:32] sin. That's what we're talking about
[26:34] this morning. Ye are bought with a
[26:37] price. Be not ye the servants of men.
[26:42] God bless you, saints.
[26:44] [Applause]
