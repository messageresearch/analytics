you i appreciate you and just thank the lord that uh he's brought you this far and continue to bless you so uh tonight we're gonna look at a very familiar scripture which i think uh all scriptures pretty familiar uh it's uh probably probably a very familiar scripture to the most of the christianity most people that claim to be a christian or go to church but tonight i don't look at a little thought here god's provided way in provision and when i was looking at this you know there's one scripture that come come to my mind when you think about god providing a way and god providing all your needs this is the one scripture that kept coming back to my mind the lord is my shepherd i shall not walk and so that's where i want to start with tonight and just look at a few things and after what we heard from brother bob and from brother wade it's been a blessing and so just want to share a few things with you tonight and i hope it's a blessing so let's just all bow our heads and speak to the author before we read the scripture tonight heavenly father we thank you for another opportunity to be in your house lord we're just so thankful for all your blessings on us lord that lord that we can come in your house lord together lord in your name and and look into your word tonight lord we just pray that you just come and help us lord and lord just get us out of the way lord that you can come and speak lord and lord just be the the speaker and lord anoint to hear the ears tonight to the hearers lord lord that we may receive from you tonight lord jesus we just commit all things to you father for each one that's uh has a need lord that's represented in this building lord you know what's on each heart and lord i just pray that you minister a special way lord and lord for your brought around the world lord there's a this uh ministers lord jesus you know the the fivefold ministry lord lord that are laboring lord i just pray that you bless them in a special way touch them anoint them and lord just help us tonight lord that we everything that we say and do will be for your honor and glory we commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen psalm 23 verse 1 says the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i'll walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me the rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies that anoints my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever amen god bless you may be seated yes well praise the lord jenny's up and walking amen well praise the lord amen god still god's still working all you got to do is believe and uh uh i didn't i didn't i forgot to say earlier but um the little boy that uh i requested prayer for sunday case and he didn't come through his surgery okay but y'all continue to pray for him he's seven years old it's a a man that i used to work with he's passed on now but it's his grandson and he's had a real bad infection they don't know how he got it but he got a real bad infection in his foot and it swelled up and they had to do surgery and it doesn't look good the doctor said that pretty much everything that he thought was bad is what come about but this the first surgery went well there's they're expecting more but they said just pray that the next one will be his last and they'll get all this infection cleaned up and then i have a friend of mine that i went to high school with and she we uh requested prayer for her a few weeks ago she had cancer and they had to remove one of her kidneys and everything and it went successful today and uh but y'all just pray that uh she doesn't have to go through any chemo or or all those things hopefully everything and uh i told her i said well you know it's about your your confession it's about what you believe and and she she said i have a personal relationship with jesus christ and he's leading me through this and he he's going to take me take care of me and lead me through his like well whatever your confession is that's that's what god's going to do he'll honor your your confession whatever you have faith in because you know he says you know as david was writing us thinking about what brother wade was talking about sunday talking about david you know he says the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he said i shall not not like a lot of people say i i you know i shall not want like no it's i shall not lack i shall not be in need the lord is my shepherd and you know you know all the way through the scripture this is a it's a very a strong analogy that's used many times in the scripture because to understand that we are like sheep we are the sheep of his uh pasture and and you know what we are and you know as jesus said you know he said that you know i am the good shepherd he said i am the door of the sheepfold you know all the all the way through the old testament the new testament we see that he talks about being a shepherd and us being sheep and how we need to be lit but he said he said the lord is my shepherd you know even in the when jesus talks about it in the in the in the gospels you know he talks about you know how a shepherd really acts has he he he lives with the sheep he cares for the sheep you know he's not like a hireling he has a great love for the sheep and he even lay down his life for the sheep and he said the lord is my shepherd and you know he wanted you know that was his confession that this is this is the this is what the lord has done for me the lord has has been so great and so gracious to me that he is that in all things he is my shepherd just as as david was a was a man of the of the sheepfold and watched out you know even when they come to take his a sheep and and you know the bear and the lion tried to come but you know he slew them and he said the same thing is even all the way through the psalms we know that david talks about how the enemies come and rose up against him and you know the lord slew him and and the lord defeated him and turned them away and all the things that that he writes about how the lord was watching over him he said the lord is my shepherd i shall not want you know of all the things that david went through his life you know david could say you know i've never had a need for anything even in the worst conditions that david was in in his life when saul was trying to kill him and the different things like that you know god never left him you know he might have left god but god never left him and god always provided a way for him even even when you know you know even when we see that you know uh god allowed saul to be placed in david's hands and you know even his men rose up and said you know now slave slay him and he said god forbid that i touched god's anointed you know even though he could have you know he didn't do that because he honored god because god still had anointed saul to be the king and he still honored that position whether whether whatever saul had done in his life he still honored saul for the position that god had given him and he says he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters you know and and i know a lot of this is it's probably heard many times and you know it's you know everybody talks about the the uh funerals and everything everybody talks about this but you know i want to look at it tonight as something that's real to me whether whether you know i mean i only preach for what i believe and what i see you know and and this is something that speaks to me but you know he says he leadeth me he maketh me lie down in green pastures you know a sheep sheep knows well you know a shepherd knows where to take the sheep for for them to eat you know he just don't feed them anything he feeds them in the best places he said he leads me beside the still waters you know it's not any turbulence or anything it's a calm place to be you know because when when you listen to the as uh david goes on in the scripture reading you know he says he leadeth me beside the still water so he leads him in a place that's calm it's it's comforting it's and you know and in god we you know no matter what goes on as as as we see here in the scripture he said he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake you know see god providing a way but he's also providing provision now you know and you know if you don't under uh i'm sure most of you do but just to just to lay this kind of down a little bit you know the word provision is is the act or of the manner of supplying something it's something that's been given to somebody um you know even in it it can be financial it can be legal it can actually be uh supplies it can actually be food it can be anything anything that a person would need that is that is what a prevent what provisions are and so you know even even through all the things so even when you go to start looking at all the things that that god talks about you know what you know all the way through the through the bible that's what he's done is he's given he's provided us all manner of things that we have need of and it doesn't matter but and and you know he said and the god's provided way you know is a is a path a manner a uh a method a uh direction anything that god provides a way that anyway something has to take place and that's that was the way that god works and he said he leadeth me so he knows the way to take and he knows how we're going to go and he wants us to go a certain way so he knows how to take us in the right direction so if if we don't if we don't try to mess it up and try to get in our own way if we just let him lead that he knows where where to take us he knows where we need to go he knows what's best for us and so when when david is reading here and speaking of god being his shepherd and when he said he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake see because when when god wants to when especially like david had a man after god's own heart and you know god wanted to use david and david wanted to be used of god and so he knew how to use him and take him down the right path that he can do what god wanted him to do because you know god saw that even when you know all of his brothers were rejected because even all of them that were you know greater might have been intelligent more intelligent made it better looking all the different things that they that that every man on the outside would have looked at that would have expected one of his other brothers to be accepted god didn't look at any of that because when he told samuel to go down there and anoint the king the new king he said you know man looks on the outside but he said god looks on the inside god's looking at what's on the inside of the man's heart to see what kind of person he is and you know that's what god was looking for a man after his own heart that that would follow him that way because you know god wants us that god wants uh what's the best for us you know he said he said i know the thoughts that i thought of you the you know thoughts of peace thoughts of goodness it and all these things you know all the things that he wants for us but but then when david says yay though walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil he said for thou art with me thou rod and my steph they comfort me so when it when it comes to times when you have to go through the valleys because you know we all brother ram said we can't live on the mountaintop no we all want a mountaintop experience we all want to live on the mountaintop but you know there's valleys you've got to face and god but he said when you go in the valleys he said that's where the lily of the valley is he said he's already made provision for you so when you go into the valley he's already there waiting on it so when he said yea thou walked through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil he said for thy rod and i staff they comfort me why because daddy he saw that there was protection there as as a sheep the shepherd was showing him that he had the a way to guide him but that was also what he used as protection as a defense protecting the sheep and so he said he said now i see these things and they no matter what i go through that but i'm not going to fear what happens because i know the shepherd is in control he's leading he's protecting me he said i rod and myself they comfort me they bring comfort to me when i see those because i know i'm protected he said thou prepare us to table before me in the presence of mine enemies you know in the in the old testament and in in earlier times ancient times we know that you know this was really an insult and and between armies if you've done this this was really an insult to them if you were if you brought two by two armies into a battle you know a soldier when he goes to battle he only eats in haste he's always looking for the enemy he's always prepared you know he's always his adrenaline's always up he's always uh mindful of what's going on but you know if you're if you're in a position where you've got two battles you know two armies ready to battle and you go out there and set a table in front of them and you spread this course and you sit down and eat you know what that's telling the other army i have no fear of you i don't fear you i don't have any respect for you and you're not going to be able to do anything for me so i'm going to sit down because most of the time they would just eat in haste you know they'd hurry up and eat you know always stuff but if i sit down and relax it show you can't do anything to me and so that's the way he says thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies so when he when he sees this that god is doing this so when you know with god there is no uh confusion there is no anxiousness with god there there is no worry with god there's no fear with god so when you when you say that thou prepares the table before when you eat when you come to god to eat of the word then you know what there is no fear there is no confusion there is no anxious there's no anxiety why because when you come up here to eat from the word of god then he said even when in the midst of all the things that go that can confound you or comes against you or whatever you know you can eat from the table of god and you know you don't have to worry because you can lay all that aside all the all the fear and everything lays aside and david says this is when i when i partake of the word of god you know what i don't lose i just let all the fear i let off the pressure and he said thou hast prepared a table before me in the presence of mine enemies why because david realized that when this took place then all the things that god god could only you know the things that come to him was only what god allowed to come against him so it wasn't anything that that was something else so you know when things came it was god had it in control so he could he could rest assure in that he said thou anointest my head with oil my cup runeth over he said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever amen so we know that we are anointed and you know i tell you what if you get within if you just get with god you know how many times can you say that your cup is overflowed and surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life amen we can dwell in the house of the lord forever god has a place for you to be and then when you come into that then you know what you don't have to worry about leaving because you know what he's not he's not throwing you out he's brought you into this place and now you can stay and rest but i i just i just wanted to share that with you and you know because i wanted to see i want to talk about god providing a way and a provision and you know david explains that so well it just it just stirs something up inside of you when you read it and you know when when you start to look in the scripture and the the place that i want to go to is is is abraham and the life of abraham and and the descendants and and some but uh you know when when you see the life of abraham you know brother said the one thing about abraham was just a normal person you know there wasn't anything there's no super abraham you know abraham was just a man but he was he was just the man that god called and he answered the call to god and god realized that abraham would believe what god told him and he would follow he would follow god wherever he went and you know and and so you know when he didn't give he didn't give abraham a lot of uh heads up he didn't give him a lot of information he said you need to get out of your father's house he said you need to get out of your father's house and you need to go to a place i show you so he didn't have any idea where he was going he just knew that he was leaving his father's house god called him and said listen it's time to go so he left where are you going abraham i don't know but i'm following god but you know as god as he began to walk with god god began to speak to abraham and tell him more about what was going on and what was going to take place and as he began to take this journey and he began to walk then you know as he began to speak to him then he began to see more things and began to tell him more things and and explain more things and you know he just began to walk and believe god now abraham had his ups and downs he had his failures but you know what he still kept walking with god and god didn't turn his back on him he kept calling abraham and abraham kept answering and so it's just it's the same way as you and i god didn't didn't look at abraham's failures he didn't look at his his turns back and all the other things that he done god kept looking at abraham because he kept believing and he kept walking you know he kept asking for forgiveness and he kept putting all that behind him and kept walking and that's the same way with you and i being the seed of abraham you know we don't look at our faults and failures because god don't look at our faults in phases if it's under the blood then you know what we shouldn't be worrying about what's under the blood because if it's under the blood it's done away with and so all we do is we're just continue to walk forward and believe what god has told us and look to see what god wants to speak to us and as and as abraham began to walk you know he said he said it's time to be separated from your family and and you know even though in the beginning you know he started to walk and and you know he got a little confused about what it meant to be separated and you know then god had to cause this confusion with lot because you know lot wasn't a part of this deal it was between him and god and you know they had to have this little little stir up so he could get rid of lots so he could go that he could follow as it just be that it would just be him and god and he began to walk with god and you know god took somebody that you know that believed but you know he had a lot of problems in his life when god told abraham said you're going to be a father of many nations you're going multitudes can you number the stars or the sand he said that's how you're going to be he's like well that's funny because i ain't never had any kids and you know we can't have kids but you know that's like well you know it don't matter and i'm old age and you know we're you know we're both got one foot in the grave and one on a banana pill you know but you know what god didn't worry about all that you know because you know what and abraham you know as the bible tells us abraham got to the place where he didn't he didn't look at his body didn't look at sarah's body to look at his circumstances he believed what god told him and so when when he began to look at the things that god had spoken to him and told him just continue to walk and continue to believe well you know that's what happened as he began to walk and he began to believe what god told him then we saw the miracles take place that all of a sudden in the midst of all these things when there wasn't anybody that was going to believe what he what he confessed and what god told him and he began to tell the people this is what god's going to do then you know they began to ridicule and mock him for what he believed but you know he just kept on walking well one day in the midst of all that thing there came a body change upon him and you know what they changed back and god began to do the work that he confessed all those years 25 years he began to walk and just it looked like a fool in front of everybody but you know what god began to make it real what what he said and then in the midst of all that you know he had a son and you know he here became in his in his in the change and all of a sudden that he had a son but you know what he wasn't it wasn't the first son that he had because you know he got a little confused in there you know and all of a sudden here he is he's got ishmael you know that's just you know kind of being that contentious one you know a little bit thrown in the flesh you know all that kind of stuff but you know you know god said you know we're not going to worry about ishmael ismail's going to do his part it's what's going to be blessed and all that but i'm going to talk about the promised son i want to talk to you about the one that i've been telling you about and that was the so when isaac came and then you know then when god gave him isaac and then he stood there after all those years of of confessing and believing and all of a sudden then him and sarah was able to have a son with all sudden god's like hey well you know now it's time for a greater test after you've stood the test and you've believed me and you've walked all this time then guess what now it's time for you to offer your son as a sacrifice brother brown said in the patriarch abraham said you know he got he gave him a double test after all this time that he walked and believed that and then he received the son and god told him said get rid of him i wanted you to offer him but you know what he'd walked all that time and didn't and didn't have any qualms in all of that and then when he walked down he told him he said you know what we're going to offer him anyone out there and he and he took the young men he took the took the animals and went to the mountain he said y'all stay here watch over the animals we're going to the mountain we're going to worship he said we're going to come back when it didn't look like there was a way out he still walked on that mountain you know when you when you have when you have children and you see them and you think what would it be like to walk on that mountain do you have that kind of faith but you know what after you've seen what god's done in your life and and god brought you through these things you know what if he's made that promise it doesn't matter what takes place he's going to fulfill his work and when he went on that mountain he took he took isaac up there and you know isaac stood there and said well father here's the wood and here's the fire where's the sacrifice he said god will provide himself a sacrifice you know what we're going to go through the things that god told us to do we're going to be faithful in god's word whether we have the answers for the world or not it doesn't matter the scripture tells us that when when it comes time he said it will be given to you what needs to be seen you know many times people out there you know there's the world is full of doubters the world is full of haters and everything like that but you know what the haters are going to continue to hate as brother matthew always talks about and the markers are going to mock but he said the believers are going to believe it doesn't matter what comes or goes you're not going to change people's mind and people get on facebook in different places and you know they get on there and they'll spend hours and hours and hours and hours arguing over little things here and there and you know what if people don't believe this message you ain't going to put it in them there's people as people that's walked in this message 30 40 20 years whatever it's been half their life most their life and all of a sudden now they tell you that brother branham's not right the prophet's not right you can't put any confidence in anything he said and they didn't pick this and nick picked that listen dangle you know you can't argue with them people i mean you got you got a better idea of arguing with that door than you do within people i mean you know you know if god don't lay it on if god speaks to you to speak to somebody that's all right but you know what a lot of people they've already turned it down but you know what that's what god said would be in the last days that there would be a falling away and that's what would have to take place and you know what praise god it did why because it's fulfilling god's word now people can argue and fuss over if they want to and try to turn people away but you know what people that can be turned away will be turned away but those that cannot be turned away that cannot be shaken that are steadfast and unmovable by the word of jesus christ by the life of god that lives inside of them you know what they're going to stand you're not going to change people's mind you can't don't worry about it i see people arguing fuss worried about kind of all that kind of stuff you know i mean it takes the holy ghost to open people's eyes and if and if they've turned away you can't you can't change their mind amen just just as abraham you know he he began to walk you know he and and his walking and all the things that he went through you know he couldn't argue with people he just had to stay with what god told him and he stood there and you know he went up on the mound he said god will provide himself a sacrifice and you know and then all of a sudden there was a ram in the caught in the thicket you know and you know he was he was ready to slay his son had him on the altar ready raised his knife when the lord stopped him do you know what he was going to he was going to go do that well because he had faith he had enough confidence in god that even if he killed him that he'd raise him from the dead it didn't matter what would take place he said that he would he would be a father of nations and this was the one that it would come through so it didn't matter what happened to the isaac no matter what happened you know isaac was going to be the one that was going and you know it just just like everybody talks about david you know david was there and you know god had anointed david to be king well you know he wasn't afraid of goliath he wasn't afraid of nothing why because he was anointed king and he knew that god was going to do that amen until he sat on the throne well you know what isaac was going to be a father why because the the seed that came from his father abraham that it would have to come through isaac also so it didn't matter what would take place one because isaac was going to be a father also and then and then jacob no matter what kind of person jacob was but jacob had had recompense to the the reward he had he had he desired that birthright he had a desire for it even though esau was a greater man greater you know as as the world would looked upon esau everybody would have loved esau much more than they would have jacob some people wouldn't want to have anything to do with jacob but god saw what was on the inside of that man and you know every one of them they came through and you know every one of them was you know and and jacob's standing there so lord if you'll bless me and god trying to talk to jacob and tell him you know what i'm gonna bless you you're blessed well lord if you'll bless me and all of the struggles that he was looking he was looking for the lord trying to bless him and you know and the lord kept trying to tell him you're blessed and you know and so many other people you know we you know we we want a word from the lord oh you know we seek for god for this and seek god for that and many times if we just sit down and be quiet you know god's trying to talk to you and tell you you are blessed right man that's right you know many people you know as they tell about the little story about the about the little cat the child that had the toy that was broken and you know he they were so worried about their toy that they took it to the father and and you know they wanted the father to fix the toy and he was trying to well daddy you need to fix this can you fix this and they were so worried about the toy that they wanted daddy to fix it and then and they were saying well daddy why don't you fix it and he was like child until you turn it loose i can't do anything until you turn it loose then i can do something and it's the same way with you and i people said cast all our cares upon him for he cares for us well you know what if we're trying to hold on to him and try to cast them if we try to give them to him if we're trying to hold on to him then he can't move because we're hindering him so if we just give them to him and say lord i'm just going to take my hands off then then i'm just going to release them to you then god can move because we can just step in and say lord i'm not going to get in your way but many times that's what happens we try to walk when we try to get in god's way because we think that we can help god along in the plan but the problem is is many times we don't know what the plan is so if we don't know what the plan is you know what you're kind of you're kind of useless you know they you know you you work it you work for a production company or you work in maintenance or as many of you have done different things you know you work on a job site well you know if people don't have an idea what you're trying to accomplish people will get up there and they try to give you ideas and they try to be a boss and try you know and if they don't have any idea what they're doing they're really just getting in your way and they're useless and you know it's the same way you know if we don't know what god's plan is for our lives then why are we trying to run it that's right we get in our own way but you know if we can just allow god to work then he can lead us the places where we need to be and you know all this time that that abraham was walking with god all through all on this journey you know he was placing his footsteps and you know all this time that they were walking all the time that they walked with god you know that was the promised land god had given them a a place to come to and here and here they are all this time they're walking you know all the footsteps that they put down was their possession and here that here they are walking and and jacob coming to coming and you know asking for the lord's blessing and and all those things and god trying to talk to him and then and then you know there came a time where you know that you know he the angel came to him and you know jacob wanted to wrestle you know he's like you know i want you to bless me i want you to bless me you know he was gonna hang on to him and he said like i gotta go he said you know he said i'm not gonna let you go till you bless me you know he wrestled with him all night long until he got a blessing from him and then you know then he was touched in the in the side you know and then he left you know then it changed the way he walked for the rest of the time he he was he was a limping prince with god but you know he come to a place through that that he realized that god had blessed him that he was blessed and then you know from jacob we or israel we see that the patriarchs came in and and you know he and all all of the sons and you know he began to multiply and and you see all the the blessings that god had done for him and you know then from from there you know all of the different ones that that had taken place and you know we see that um we see that from jacob we see that joseph came in into being you know his son and you know it was it was a perfect man and you know was you know all the things that that we know about joseph and his life and you know being being a a spiritual man and and you know all the things that you know being hated of his brothers and because he was different you know because and he was loved of his father and and all those things but you know we know that god told god told abraham he said he said your your children your descendants your seed he said they'll they'll be strangers in a strange land they'll sojourn in a strange land and he said he said in the midst of all that he said then he said they'll be brought out with a great deliverance so bring them out and you know here's here's joseph you know being being this being the son and you know he was he was loved of his father and hated of his brothers and you know being spiritual and we know that god spoke to joseph and began to explain to him how what things were going to take place and you know they they hated him and and because he because he was the peculiar person and and all the things that had taken place and then he began to have dreams and tell the dreams and well that just made him more you know madder at him because you know they just was made more more angry and because you know then that even even got rebuked by his dad because he said you know we're going to bow to you but you know you know it was still the word of god it was still it's still what joseph was just telling what god was showing him you know he wasn't trying to make anything of himself but it was just god speaking to him and in the midst of you know as he began to speak and began to walk before the lord and you know we know that you know they uh hated him so much they wanted to get rid of him they conspired to kill him but you know it was reuben that told them said you know we're not going to shed in and sent blood you know he's he's our he's our brother we're not going we're not going to kill him but you know they came came the uh time when the caravan came by i believe it was ishmaelites or whatever you know they came by and you know so they sold him into slavery so well you know we'll get rid of him we won't have to deal with him anymore so he's going to be out of our hands out of our hair we'll get rid of him but we won't kill him so that blood won't be able but you know they went and deceived their father said you know your son is dead we found his coat of many colors dipped in blood and you know that then you know jacob was there and you know he was talking about oh i'm gonna be in mourning for the rest of my life because he's gone from me and you know he said you know my great hairs will go to the to the ground because my son is gone i'll never be comforted from this and i'll never get over this but you know we see that how joseph was sold into slavery and his brothers thought well we got rid of him you know but you know there came a time when in the midst of all these things that joseph here's here's amanda's after you know it was a great man spiritual was a prophet and you know all the things that he had done he had a perfect life and yet all this stuff had befallen him all these terrible things that come upon him where he's sold into slavery and he's bound and he's taken away from his family and even though his brothers didn't didn't care for him too much you know he still missed being with his family he loved them but you know he went away but you know god had his hand on him even in the midst of all the struggles and all the torments and all the things that he had he faced god still had his hand on joseph and even when he got sold into slayer you know and he went down there was in potiphar's house and he went in and in the midst of all that everything that joseph put his hand to he was blessed that he blessed potiphar's house and everything that took place and and then and then when potiphar's wife you know she tried to she wanted him to to lie with her and all that you know and then he ran from him they put him in prison and you know he was there in in the prison house and you know even in the midst of all the they the the guard of the prison house realized what kind of man that joseph was and then he brought him and he put him over everybody and and you know and even even in the prison the prison house was blessed because joseph was there you know and god still had his hand upon him and you know and all the things that they saw that that he done and as as he was walking through and all these things that took place and then in the midst of all of this you know joseph was was walking and he was you know just living the life before and everybody's like well why you know you'd have to think why is all this befalling us but you know what it was to fulfill the scripture it was to fulfill the word amen now brother branham says in in the message this is from proving his word he said he promised his seed to be a stranger in a strange land and be misjudged by the people and they would sojourn abraham's seed for 400 years among strangers strange people and he fulfilled his word just exactly what he said he would do abraham c did sojourn in egypt 400 years he promised also to deliver them with a mighty hand a strong hand he would deliver the people out of the egyptian bondage and he kept his word look what he had to do to get them children down in egypt it looked like a disaster had was befalling and everything he said look how horrible for joseph to be considered dead and he was talking about how hard it was for he says isaac but he said says jacob his father to believe that his own son was killed by animals how hard it was for little joseph to know that the poor little fell away from his people betrayed by his brethren thrown in a ditch supposedly to be dead sheep blood put on his coat where they had slayed a lamb to eat it put the blood on it and took it to his father knowing all this but joseph could remember one thing that the hand of the lord was upon him he knew that he was a believer no matter how his brothers turned him out how much there was no cooperation or nothing else joseph knew god would keep his word when he saw that vision of all them bowing before him he know that he that had to come to pass because it was thus saith the lord amen don't care how unreasonable it seemed joseph knew it was the truth no matter how hard the task was and what he had to go through with he knew someday every one of them would bow before his feet how is it how is he going to do it when they hated him but god god knowed god would prove his word every time amen so we know that you know joseph here went through or yeah joseph went through all this but you know god had his hand on him and he knew that god was going to bring it through and you know even in the midst of all of that and and you know the the the baker and the butler were cast into the prison and and you know they they asked about the about their dreams and he interpreted the dreams correctly and you know we knew what took place how the butler was restored and the baker was was slain and you know how all these things and you know yet he was still forgotten about but until the pharaoh received you know had these dreams that he couldn't interpret to see what was going to take place and in the midst of all this then when it when it comes to place they couldn't find anybody to interpret the dreams then the butler was like oh yeah i remember a fella he's down in the prison but he could interpret dreams and so you know then then joseph was brought forth and he could interpret the dreams and realize listen pharaoh this is what what your dreams are there's a famine coming you're going to have you're going to have a period of great harvest you're going to have everything's going to be great for a while but all of a sudden then there's going to be seven years that you're going to have a famine and you need to prepare and he and he gives him said this is what we're going to have to do to prepare and then when when pharaoh sees that this was going to take place then when he brings it to this then he realized you know is there any man in all of egypt that has the wisdom of god that is anointed with the spirit of god that can be over this and so in all of the things that took place then then pharaoh elevates joseph to the second in command to next to him and he said listen he said i want you to and implement all this and take care of all this and you know when we see all this take place well then then you know in the famine time that his brothers came and you know they came and he recognized them they didn't recognize him but you know then he began to speak to his brothers and and you know make it kind of hard on them at first because they had come back and you know he said you're spies and he said y'all just come to see the land and he said you know he said well we have another brother we have one that's that's not with us and we've got one that's still with our father and he's like you're just liars he said i want to see the other one he keeps i guess i believe it was simian or whichever one he kept you know he kept one of the brothers he sent them back and he said you gotta bring your brother back and he said if you don't and your brother's dead and you know all the things that took place and you know then you know then he was able in time when they came back then he was able to he couldn't hold his self any longer you know he had to identify himself and he told him he said listen i'm joseph i'm your brother he said you know all the things that have taken place look he said he said you know he said y'all hated me he said y'all wanted to get rid of me but he said look he said all of this he said god done this to to preserve life he said is my father still alive and you know he said then bring you then bring your your brothers and your sisters down and and everybody your all of your all your children and your children's children everybody bring everybody down bring my father down i want to see him and he said there's a place here for you there's a place in goshen for you he said because because we've got many more years of a famine left but he said there's a place for you that i can take care of you and you know we know that the the children of israel came down into into egypt and they were able to live out their uh the time of the famine but you know when and all of that you know it was fulfilling god's word and you know and many times when we see things that that we don't understand we don't understand why things happen the way they do but you know here it was fulfilling the word of god and here they are bringing all of those people down into the land of egypt and they became a great mighty nation and they were blessed during that time until there came one that didn't know joseph and then there came a pharaoh that didn't know joseph and did not know the blessing that laid it within their in their borders but here was a blessing but you know what he didn't he didn't recognize any of that that was that wasn't nothing to him one because he didn't he didn't know anything he just knows these people are a enemy to me why because he was fearful of them because they were so powerful and not realizing what a blessing they were they were they were not they're trying to take over egypt why because egypt was not their land egypt was not not their homeland was not anything they wanted but you know to fulfill the word that abraham received that god had to speak to them and he had to harden pharaoh's heart to bring the children of israel back out of egypt back to the promised land the promised land that he made of abraham and you know in all of these things and and so you know then it came time that that he had to bring them out you know and and so you know here they are and when when they receive this pharaoh they didn't know joseph and he was like you know we're going to destroy these people we're going to kill we're going to kill all the children we're going to get rid of these people and you know there was and yet all of those people down there saying you know god said it was going to be a deliverer you know amram and joseph down there talking about you know there's going to be a deliverer and all the things that they had went through and all the ones that they had seen all of those children get killed being fed to the alligators and all the things that they had went through but you know god raised up one to deliver them amen to bring them out you know and and you know sometimes when we when we see things we we see things we only see things in the short term but sometimes we don't see the long-term effects of things you know because you know you know here many people they read the story of joseph and you know many times they just think joseph was in it was in egypt and you know they came down there and he preserved their life but you know something had to take place because the word to abraham had to be fulfilled and so when he came down there you know all of that had to take place but see joseph stand there knew that he was he was anointed of god but you know he did not realize that he was the one that was going to fulfill see god had spoken to him and he had this uh vision of what was going to take place but you know there was another vision that was spoken that was going to take place and that was that he was going to bring his people out by a mighty hand but they had to be in that land and so they had to be brought down into egypt and so all these things had to work together to fulfill the word of god and you know many times we see things that happen in our lives and we wonder why things happen the way they do why because god is fulfilling the word and sometimes we see the word we see parts of the word but we don't see the full picture but you know god don't want us to see the full picture sometimes he wants us to focus on the one part that he's trying to fulfill trying to show us something and if we can see that then we then later on he can show because many times we see things in our lives and we wonder and we look back and you know and you know you look back a few years later and you look at that and you think man that was a that was an amazing thing that god brought me through that was an overcoming but sometimes you know when you look back many years later then you look back and say man that was even greater well because when you see those things sometimes we don't see the full magnifi the magnificent work of god when it when it first takes place in our lives we see things it's like man that was amazing but then later on that we realized you know it was even a greater victory than sometimes when you look back on it to say what god has done and how god has brought you through these things and and god has delivered you and god is ministered to you and you think man what god has done and you know what you're just like i can't thank him enough i can't give him enough glory i can't give him enough praise because you then as you begin to see the things that you've seen in your life and what god has done for you you know it's such an amazing thing and and so you know there's many times we look back in our lives and and we see you know we begin to focus on certain things and not realize what god has done for us and seeing those things that take place but you know here here god told them said listen we're gonna they're gonna come out and even you know all the things that they solve but you know what god never forgot what he told abraham and you know and then he stood there and he spoke to moses in the burning bush and he stood there and he said he said i've heard the cry of my people why because you know he told them hey listen they're going to be down there they're going to sojourn in a land but he says you know what when they get tired of being down there when things happen you know then they're going to cry and i'm going to hear them and he said i've come down he said i've come down to deliver them but he said i'm going to send you i anointed you to do that right and you know in the in the midst of all that and you know it's not like the people live in a bubble you know because you know when when moses was speaking you know moses knew what happened to abraham abraham he knew what happened to isaac he knew he knew the scripture he knew what happened to the children of israel he was he wasn't living you know living in a cocoon somewhere he knew what took place but you know what when god come down and began to speak to him then it's like well you know what you're going to be the deliverer you know many hundreds of years ago i spoke to the patriarch abraham and told him what was going to take place but you know what you're going to fulfill that scripture you're going to be the one to do that and you know many times people say you know it's put in the scripture but then you know what it becomes you and i are going to be god's hands we're going to be god's feet we're going to be god's mouth we're going to be god's eyes and god wants to use you to do it and sometimes we think you know well you know it's going to be it's going to be somebody else you know it's going to be brother dale or brother wade or you know it's going to be somebody else no sometimes it's going to be you no matter how simple you are no matter how low you are because you know when all of this started with joseph joseph was only 17 years old and at 17 years old he entered into the will of god and was working the will of god living in a living in a filthy dungeon somewhere but you know it was fulfilling the word of god that's right and you know and all the things that happened to to uh moses as as moses was you know put in the ark and sit down in the nile and it and you know then he raised up in pharaoh's house what a what you know a great mighty intelligent man he was that he lived in and you know taught the people of egypt all these things and what a great stature that he had and how he was beloved of the pharaoh and everything but then when it come to time he had to run why because it wasn't time because he tried to fulfill the scripture that his mother told him about about being the deliverer tried to fulfill it on his own he did not wait for god but when god come and spoke to him by the burning bush and kept telling him said now after you've sat on the back side of the desert for 40 years and i've beat all of your ignorant idiocracy out of you because he became and you know he become an educated idiot because he thought he was by his education he would come to the place that he got puffed up that he thought he could do something didn't take away the position that he was the deliverer but the problem was he had to get to the place where god could use him god wanted to meet him and when god met him then it was time for him to go and but he stood there and said oh oh oh god i can't talk you know you know you know look at me you know i can't talk i don't have a good mouth you know god said listen i'm not worried about that i've anointed you i've called you you got a commission it's time for you to go and do this and in the midst of that you know he don't say well he said we're going to send your brother aaron along with you but you know he gave him he said listen he said they're not gonna believe me down there he said that's all right i'm gonna give you the two signs you're gonna go down there and show them right and he said you know then he started walking down there you know walking with a walking with a donkey with a stick an old man walking down through there wife on the on the donkey child on her hip going down through there where are you going moses take over amen i'm going to be the biggest problem egypt's ever had a one-man invasion i come to take over why because god anointed me [Music] the greatest nation in the world and and they they thought some old man that's been spent too much time in the desert they don't uncooked his brain no god made blood had ways and when they went down there you know he told him said let my people go time to go nope you ain't going well that's all right you know he went down there and janice and jamboree stood him you know that didn't change the fact he didn't get nervous he didn't get worried why because he stood what god god had told him and all the things you know god told him said listen call for the flies free the fleas frogs turn the water to blood do everything it didn't change mo didn't change the pharaoh he still you're not going you're not going you're not going and all the and all of the uh gods of egypt you know the major gods of egypt you know moses went down there and you know they had the water god you know the one the one that blessed the denial he was he was the the or woman whatever it was the deity that supposedly blessed the knowledge he went down and turned it to blood well you know what showed their god couldn't do that couldn't change it back of all the things destroyed their crops sent all the pestilence in there and they had all these gods and you know they were supposed to control all this well you know what god went down there and showed them well that deity doesn't doesn't work and that one doesn't work and i defeated that one and i've defeated that one and the sun god was there we made it dark it was so dark that it said that it was felt that's pretty dark but you know what all the things that they've done you know he went down there and proved all of their deities you know there is a show what he's showing to the children of israel all these things that you've seen in all these years where the egyptians have beat this stuff and you know it wasn't just a physical abuse that you see that that we talk about we we talk about the reason of their taskmasters and all those things but you know what takes place when you go down through there it's to come the the all the constant bombardment of the mental abuse that you have to deal with because can you can you imagine them coming out there those taskmasters well you know what if your god was real you wouldn't be in this mess i thought you had this great god that could do things well by our great gods we've got you bound and look what you're doing you're building these great buildings and raising these monuments up to our great gods and everything and look what we're going what we got going on and you know we got all this cheap labor going on and you know all these type of things that they have to deal with but you know what god god didn't god didn't forget about them and they just kept on going they kept walking and you know all of a sudden you know when it come to the time then pharaoh was like well it's time to go you know when when god when god got to the point where pharaoh was tired and he wore him down you know and all you know he wanted to get rid of him and told him to go yeah but you know when when pharaoh was you know he he got to the point in itself that he was so worked up that you know he realized you know well i'm not i'm not going to let him go you know because you know while if you get to that point where you leave and and then you see them that they're leaving then all of a sudden you know it was something that was so raised up inside him that you know he didn't want to be defeated he was like well i'm gonna go after him well you know moses told them he said the ones you see today said you'll see them no more god brought you through and then you know and all the things that god brought them through brought them to the land opened up the red sea they walked through on dry land when they got to the place you know oh you know how we going to get over this no god had a place and had a way to get them over but then they stood there and they watched their enemy destroyed in a supernatural way all of those standing there watching the watching the greatest army in the world that great empire be destroyed and then you know then they couldn't go but you know just two three weeks whatever it was a month journey to the promised land three days journey whatever it was you know they're out there 40 years walking in the same same place same thing murmuring and complaining god's speaking to them and telling them listen you all need to get ready so you can go in this land and they're still bound to the same thing facing the same thing going around in the same circle going through the same thing and still not any further along but god brought them through but you know when they couldn't when they couldn't believe and they couldn't walk in what god had told them then you know what they ended up dying in the wilderness but you know what there was a promised sea that went in and took that land that fulfilled the word that that god had spoken to abraham that god had spoken to him and told him what was going to take place and god god led him in and god fulfilled his word and many times you know if we see things that we don't understand why things happen the way they do in our lives you know what just hold on god will show you because you know you know god will fulfill the word that he has for each one of us and you know and you know when we see these things in our lives and we don't understand i want to i want to share this with you you know when you see these things take place don't be disheartened by what you see you know don't give up by what takes place because you know when it was so amazing because you know when all these things took place you know they all looked back to the patriarchs and said do you remember do you remember and even and you know even when you get to in the book of acts in the in the seventh chapter of acts i believe it is when stephen stands up and preaches that wonderful message to the people and he began to speak of the things that took place and all the ones that had taken in place in the past and he stood there and he and he went back and he started talking about what god had done for our father abraham and come all the way down and was showing all the things and he said you know all of them but you know they turned away from what god had showed them god had told them what was going to take place and then y'all turned it down and he said and then you know and he began to expound all the way through the scripture and then stephen got to the place and he told y'all circumcised and stiff next and he said y'all always resist the word you always resist god of everything he's had to do he said it's the same spirit that was out there in the wilderness that would stood moses that was stood joshua all them y'all are the same ones it's the same spirit and y'all stand right here and you know what they got so mad that the scripture says that they gnashed their teeth and you know they just couldn't wait to get rid of to get rid of stephen just like they done the deposit the prophets and the ones in the old testament y'all done the exact same way y'all here they are y'all seen all these things and y'all just can't wait to get rid of them and here they are talking about in the in the street and stoning get out there and stone stephen well he sealed his he stole this testimony in his own blood but you know when he began to say you know i see i see jesus standing at the right hand of the father you know and you know he said lord don't lay this to their charge that was an amazing that was an amazing scene and you know there was a man that was standing there and they they held their coats and he was in and he was in conspiracy with these people and he agreed with them and he stood there and they laid their coats at his feet and you know what was so amazing was when you read that in that scripture that here here's this man and he saying he's standing there watching brother stephen get stoned and stephen's laying on the ground dying watching watching getting his head blasted but the last thing that stephen has to say is lord don't lay this to their charge he had so much love and you know who was standing there listening to that and you know who's who god who stephen was calling out for do you know who he was called out he was calling out for the apostle paul paul's standing there listening being being a conspirator being an accomplice to murder to murder stephen and stephen calling out to the apostle paul and saying lord don't lay this to his charge i tell you what i do if i don't stir your soul your spoons fell out of your bowl why because let me tell you something brother scissors there's people that that you don't know about you don't know well you've never seen you'll never see on this side of glory that have had your name and had you in their prayer and you don't know who's interceded for you and you'll never know who they are but they have interceded for you and even in the scripture tells us that even jesus prayed for us and that he interceded to the father on our behalf because you know what we're going to live in this world but you know what he said you've given these to me and they will overcome brothers and sisters we've been given a word and you know what we can stand up and claim our word and because god has said somebody that's come and interceded and we haven't had a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and knows the struggles and the pains and the heartaches that we've been through and brothers and sisters we've had somebody that's interceded on our behalf and he said you know what we are more than conquerors through him that loved us he's given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness and you'll be given everything and you know what brothers and sisters all you gotta do is claim it but because we've seen a great cloud of witnesses that have come and have overcome all the powers of the darkness and they've overcome the enemy and jesus has said you know he said he has come the prince of this world has come and he said he has no part in me why because i'm who have the word and i've come from my father and i go to my father and he said you and i are the same way brothers and sisters we've come from god and we go back to god we may fall and fail and we may have issues and we may have problems but let me tell you something brothers and sisters we're more than conquerors to him that loved us [Applause] god has provided the way and the provisions whatever you have nato one because he's given us away jesus said i am the way the truth and the life he said none come to the father but by me you've been called by god and he's brought you into the household of faith he's he's given you his spirit well he didn't give it to you just so you can fail just so you can live defeated amen but he's given you the holy ghost so that you'll overcome i wanna i wanna live and now i want to know what as as paul said i want to know him in the power of his resurrection i want to know i want to overcome i want to know why because i want to get out of here i don't want to live in this past house any longer why because god has created a better place for us yes i want to go i don't want to be here any longer scripture says they overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony don't don't lose your testimony that's right whatever it is yea though i'll walk through the valley of the shadow of death whatever you go through don't turn away god has made a way and he's given provision amen and it doesn't matter we don't know where it's going to come from when they sold joseph into slavery they did not realize but you know what he came to preserve life it doesn't matter where you're at today no matter where you sin or you fall there's still a high priest there's still a fountain open in the house of david for sin and uncleanness god bless you tonight let's all stand have the musicians come i want to sing that song i want to live the way he wants me to live i don't know what key that'll be half a man hallelujah [Music] i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just

[Music] surrender oh jesus all jesus i surrender all the kingdoms of my heart [Music] jesus be the lord of all the kingdoms of my heart amen god bless you tonight i was thinking about i had in my notes i didn't get but you know in ephesians 4 the scripture talks about you know he gave some apostles and a prophets an evangelist and then it continues on for the perfecting of the saints he says that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine and the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ for whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joints supply us and you know you know many times when we think about things you know it's no there's no big eyes there's no little use every part is important but that's the reason he says the in the whole body everything works together i think but you know the scripture there where it says and compacted that which every joint supply you know that's a that's a tight-knit group compacted you know that's the reason that when brother and talked about in in the message to the church you know he talked about you know he said the brother had the dream of the armor and he said you cinched it up everybody get closer together you know we have to be draw closer to one another in him he draws us close closer together according to the fetch effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so everything that we do we should realize we do unto the lord but you know it's to edify the body so it's not just everybody on an island every little thing that we do we do under the lord but everything is for the edification of the body every little thing we come to church you know it's to edify at one another everything that we do is to bless one another you know so there is no you know insignificant ones if you're not here we miss you if you're sick we feel for you if you're hurt everybody's the same that's wrong just like he said he said we ought to be close enough to one another chew each other's chewing gum like i've always said everybody says i want to chew it first i told him i said when the lord tells me to chew your chewing gum my will god ain't never told me to chew your gum but i don't mind if he tells me do it i'll do it i mean i don't i just i just have that much confidence but i don't know why he would want me to but if i need to i will but i want to be that willing that that if i need to i can well god bless you nada appreciate each one of you love you and uh let's sing let's sing one more before we go and time is filled with transition note of
