========================================

church talk about how they were amounts of money they gonna gamble for and play for but they knew nothing riddled of jesus christ it don't matter how good you are if you don't have jesus christ in your heart you're not nearly good enough that's right we're going to read this morning from isaiah the 55th chapter verses 1 through 13. let us pray heavenly father we pray that you would awaken our hearts lord that we may receive the blessing of your holy word brother we may have the revelation of your worry love for ourselves lord it's not what others think about us lord is what you know about us god we ask you to guide us and to strengthen us father please help us father for we realize that thou we live lord of the late hour we can look and see all around us how everything is taking place but jesus help us so when you come and it's our time to leave this world lord we don't want people to give testimony about us lord about things that we are not father we want you to be with us lord and let us live every day lord that we may know where we stand and that's in your presence in jesus christ and we pray amen amen you're going to read from isaiah the 5th to 55th chapter verses 1 through 13. oh everyone that thirsty come ye to the waters and he that had no money come ye buy and eat ye come buy wine and milk without money and without price [Music] [Music] incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you ever even the sure mercies of david behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knoweth not and nation knoweth not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god and for the holy one of israel for he shall glorify thee let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thought let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for the will for for he will abundantly pardon [Music] for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so shall my word be that goes out of my mouth it shall not return unto me lord for it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the things whereof i in it instead of the throne shall come up the first tree instead of the bride shall come up with myrtle tree and it shall be the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off i mean god bless you you may be seated brother luis would you come and take the offering this morning lord thank you once again for the opportunity to serve you lord we just pray father that you would just continue to bless the service lord and you just help us father god to just have the right spirit to worship you in spirit and in truth lord you bless this offering lord and may you just continue to use it lord god for the uplifting of your kingdom lord god we thank you for those that can give and those that cannot give you we pray that you bless them pray this in jesus christ oh i just come to glorify glorify your name i just come to glorify glorify your name there's no greater name i know i tell it i tell it wherever i go glorified glorify his name what'd you do this morning [Music] [Music] no greater name for there's no greater name i know i tell it wherever [Music] your name some glad morning we shall see jesus in the air coming [Music] shall rise [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] that is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we begin to sing singing in the holy ghost millions there will join that soul with them we shall be in christ [Music] shall rise [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] let's get a little bit of that today [Music] hallelujah when we meet our blessed savior in the skies singing [Music] god [Applause] we can have a temporary resurrection right now amen if you can raise your hand up to god that's a temporary resurrection amen because it defies gravity and you tell god that hey i'm here i'm here i'm here it's time for me it's my time today is it your time today if it's not you should have stayed home amen we believe that we going to meet god today right amen we're going to meet the lord today boy we had a good time in bible study last night somebody say amen [Applause] and saying nothing against the old people that weren't there but you should have been cause we had a good time a good time a real good time and those ones that was on the zoom meeting sister freda and different ones that zoom meeting is open for anybody if you look on whatsapp you can get uh get the address to uh to get on it and you can ask questions and and you can just be part of the group if you're not able to i know it's tough but you know what a little bit later on we're going to preach on faith is works huh no works is faith expressed your works shows that you've got faith amen and brother branham i just read a quote where brother brown said it ain't shouting faith is not that faith is a settled in your heart that god's going to do what he said he'd do you know why god said so from now we're going to say god said so not man not an angel god said so and god gave us this word to believe let me read you a little quote here on there's only one provided way of god for anything brother brown says i don't believe in intellectual speeches i believe in the word itself and then stay with that promise until it's made manifest and fulfilled that's our problem that's our problem we say okay we believe god's word this is a good thing to be this is a good meeting that we're in this is a good feeling that we're having and then you go home and the devil goes god will never do that if y'all were here last night i appreciate everybody that was here but i want you to understand something as we were saying last night and i believe it'll turn a switch on if you'll think about it that listen god can't change his mind right think with me god can never have a new thought he can never think of something and then think of something different everybody with me so if he loves you now he always has loved you there's not an up and down in the day you think oh god's left me no you left god not don't put the fault on god because he don't change but we have to if we meet his requirement then we what we changed to him not him changed us and there's not days sure we have bad days sure we have good days but you know what god still loves us if he loved this before the foundation of the world there's no way he can change that amen because he saw that you would love him down here therefore by foreknowledge he loved you up there amen really simple predestination and so see you think well that's just god pulling you through a tube no it's god seeing what you wanted seeing your desires by your free will by your free moral agency he saw what you wanted and if you didn't want it he didn't have to have it back there to give it to you if you never wanted it adolf hitler they never wanted it so god never had him in the eternal part of his mind back before the foundation of the world sure he thought of adolf hitler but he out hitler was not in his eternal thoughts you and i are not just part of the eternal thoughts we are his eternal thoughts made manifest and unfolded down here we had to come down here god loved us but we had to come down here to do what show that we love him amen come here as my savior my healer my redeemer all the redemptive names of jehovah that's why we love him more than just being zombies that come to the earth and saying oh this is our god no we come down here to go through trials tibulate tribulations and all these different things sicknesses that we go through i was thinking yesterday i'm gonna keep you standing for a minute stretch your legs but i was thinking yesterday you know brother ron spencer everybody knows him he has stage four cancer it's in several parts of his body he's taking chemotherapy he stood in a prayer line the other night and prayed for people for an hour with stage four cancer now what is a greater testimony because see he went back to the doctor and the doctor says you still got it but we don't know why you're reacting like you are freda been taking chemo and all different things she don't even look any different than she did before right but there's brother ron and i said what a greater testimony what's a greater testimony than for for ron to come in and say well they found nothing i'm cancer-free you say oh praise god that's a miracle but what about him standing and preaching every sunday going through a prayer line and and he goes to the doctor and they said you still got it but we don't understand that's a greater mystery and a miracle to me that if you can have it this disease and still function as the bride of jesus christ so let's just take that as our faith and let it build our faith that all things are possible with god stage four cancer boy it sounds bad well watch him online every once in a while you think he's got stage four holy ghost is what you think he's got and ain't no stage four cancer not in that guy but uh thank you again for the bible study i will go through this real quick thank you all the kids are back from camp and brother bob and some of his family our brother richard wilson is preaching this weekend brother lewis will be preaching louise louis brother louise will be preaching for us this wednesday all right um we'll have communion and foot washing this afternoon and after communion and foot washing we're getting down to the nitty-gritty about two weeks before we get ready to leave less than now we're going to meet downstairs in the common room i say the biggest room we've already got the rooms already got the bus we're ready to go so but we need to get the um trim our pencils and and figure out what we're going to take and what we need and what we don't need we saw the buses yesterday they're super nice buses that were bust that were taken it's a prevost which is a lexus of of buses and and it will be a uh it will be a wonderful time but we just got to get to uh get our itinerary down and figure out when we're going to leave what we're going to do when we get there and all that and we need like i said before we got to pitch in and help because there's going to be about 50 people besides they're 14 and then maybe a few i had another brother call me from a church not far from there and thinking about maybe sending some of their people over so on saturday so it may be a little bit more than we bargained for but you know what we're ready we're good we're all right and we appreciate brother chris last weekend man he did a good job yeah man i mean he laid it out exactly the way you should have laid it out that's that uh that's a testimony of a of a good balanced minister that's brother louise i'm a good balanced minister that we can we can listen to and get things out of uh also just one more announcement august the 3rd through the 5th is the camp meeting at brother joe greens if anybody wants to go now dad and i and mom and june are going by our car will be full but if you want to go we're going on thursday and friday and brother keith reed's coming back with us that night on friday night and he's going to preach for us that weekend so the weekend of the 6th and 7th brother keith will be with us on that sunday everybody with me uh i think we'll go ahead and have a bible study on saturday night why not brother keith and just francine to be with us we'll go ahead and have bible study and everything will be just like before we'll have communion and foot washing because we need to do it you know how many of y'all are on fixed income all right don't be ashamed i'm getting close all right right first of the month you get paid on that first of the month and that sustains you through the month right but now when you get down to the end of the month bank account ain't what it was the first of the month right so that's the way it is with christianity i believe we we need to pack in all weekend the first of the month communion foot washing bible study and that will sustain us and then well you know what we need to do it all over again the next month you don't get just one check for a year you get a check for a month and then you get another check for another month and another check for another month well that's what with god he give us a check remember brother brown said he gave us a check with jesus's name signed on it he said you just fill it out so we're gonna fill it out we're gonna do all the ordinances of god we're gonna get everything done and then we're going to have a good time in the lord amen so just remember that brother keith will be here on the seventh so part 46 of who is this son of man we're going to continue on with faith and talk a little bit about renewing of your mind because that's what it says there in romans but let's bow our heads before we get started lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the purchase of your blood that's standing before us today lord there's many millions of people around this world that are following this message lord that this morning some because in a different time zone have already had service we're beginning to have and there's some that's not have any that's not having any yet lord as you the s-u-n goes across the united states and across the different parts of the country let the s-o-n do the same thing let this son of man become real to your bride lord as we look and see that we are coming to the end of an age father and we've come into a time lord even a time of dispensational change where dispensation is now will be the son of man it'll be god in human flesh and a people we pray that you'd be with us lord lift our faith and lord as we maybe later on we'll talk about james talking about works and paul talking about faith but we know that faith without works not any good we are here lord to see you work in our life but it's going to be according to our faith is how you work today lord so let's raise our faith up to another level help us lord to do that renew our mind lord our mind is muddled with all different things that we were talking about last night we got still got a carnal mind that thinks thoughts it shouldn't be that that do that makes us do things that we shouldn't do but lord father you said in your word that we're to be as luis was reading come to perfection and to come to perfection we've got to do the simple things first have simple faith that when i come to church i'm going to hear from you when i study i'm going to hear from you when i pray i'm going to hear from you that you're not some some god that's off somewhere lord no you said you're right here with us and we carry you with us lord and may that become more precious as the days go forward just bless each one that's not here bless brother bob and be with him lord as he preaches be with the ones that are on vacation in different places lord coming back home we pray they should be with them father just take care of us in the furthem of this service we ask in the name of jesus amen all right john 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now how many of you know that we know for one thing's for sure that scripture was fulfilled when jesus came on earth and now we know where that jesus is he's in me and you so now our flesh our flesh listen his flesh is no different than ours as far as flesh goes he had to have a german and egg come together god created it we know that and he but but that flesh was not eternal that flesh was not perfect that flesh was getting old it was dying but by one scripture it couldn't corrupt it was corruptible but he couldn't corrupt because of one scripture i'll not leave his soul in hell or suffer thy holy one to see corruption so when are we gonna jump into that we jump into that we'll see that since he's already died we don't have to we don't have to die we don't have to by faith we're going to see that romans 12 verse 2 says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by what by the renewing of your mind our thoughts and that statue of perfect man is not so much it's inside the soul but it's letting me out into the other outlets of memories and conscious affection imagination which that's where you're what that's where your mind is amen so by the renewing of your mind that you may prove now look that you may prove not god you god's going to prove through you what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god we know that's his word for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think balance but to think soberly according as god hath dealt with every man the measure we were talking about last time of faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office we don't have 12 pastors we don't have 24 preachers right you've got certain ones that stand in that position and that position is what we need we honor the position and we have laity we have deacons and different ones but that makes a body as brown said not an organization but an organism all right everybody with me on that an organism not an organization all right having them gifts different according to the grace that is given to us as brother louise said we can some of you would some of you come up under pentecost and you can shout and speak in tongues and because that's what you came up under somebody come up under baptist some of it become other presbyterians some of them just come up from the world all right and so you have different gifts but you know what that's what i want you to see that you move into that you've got to move into that you got to move into that part that you are and stay there stay in that gift that god gave you because you know what he's not going to give you somebody else's gift he's going to give you your gift if you believe that whether it be prophecy let us prophesy according to the what proportion or portion of faith that is given to each one of us you may be seeing the lord as blessing to the reading of the word so now we've been talking about the first stage we're going to fly through this real quick because i want to get to something the first stage is the birth listen you got to be born again and we were talking last night you know it's it's good that let me say it this way if if you're if you're a beginner in god and if you're trying to get your life right and you're trying to get the new birth or you're trying to to do things right you may be your backslid maybe you've maybe you've went away from god maybe you don't have the new birth but you try don't worry about the seal don't worry about daniel 70 weeks don't worry about what you're gonna eat in the millennium don't worry about how we gonna do it how now listen we talked about that last night but i thought you can talk to a baby but then you also gotta talk to the mature ones there's your balance we can have so much teaching until we leave the little ones away behind and we can have so much milk until the ones that won't meet gets hungry amen so you got to have that balance so every once in a while you gotta go one way with the young kids and stay here but let me instruct you though if you're a young person in christ just get to know christ read your bible study the word of god and then what your works is going to show how much faith you got come to church read your bible be a part of the church you don't have to be a part of the church well i got to do everything i you got to be aware of those people sometimes that wants to do everything right we had a guy at mcdonald's one time when they have that we just had the new double drive through remember you know how they are you pay on one side and then go get your food on them just got it this was back in the oh i don't know maybe in the motherboard 80s so so this guy i mean how many of you kids love to work on friday night not many how many of y'all love to work on saturday night when all your friends without pottering and having a good time no you didn't want to wear it this one kid he wanted to work every friday night and every saturday night and we thought you know what first thing we thought man this guy we need more like him the joker was stealing us blind friday night and saturday night are you two busiest nights of the week he was in that back double drive-through and he was taking and taking if you give him four dollars he's getting 350 and putting it in the tail and taking 50 cents to put it in his pocket so beware of those people that want to do everything right i'm i'm here i'll just do whatever well be careful that's why i said luis good sermon today balance amen balance i don't want to do everything and y'all may hate me i don't care i really i really don't care if you hate me about this but i've got sister regina's going to do part of this this uh um leaving and and getting on time and doing all this stuff because you know what we need it and i don't want to do it i got other things to do all right so we what we delegate amen but you delegate it to somebody that you feel can do a good job all right but that guy was stealing us blind there's no telling how much that little kid finally about a month a month later somebody said that guy's working too many friday night to be 16 years old and so we started watching him from the outside somebody would stand outside in a car sit in a car and watch in that drive through and watch him take in a five dollar bill and then give an amount of change and then we pulled his drawer real quick and counted it and yeah we found him real quick let him go we didn't we didn't send him to the pokey but those of you that don't know what that was that's the jail we just slapped him on the hands and said look man get out of here but he was jealous he was zealous about what he was doing well he was zealous because he wanted to steal his blind so romans 8 verse 5 why in the world i said that for as many as are left by the spirit of god they are the son just beware they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear now look fear and faith doesn't work together faith has no place for fear ever right so you've not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received what the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit now we were talking about that the other day that we are the children of god now look that's good to just stop right there but you got to continue on because you get something if you're a child you're an heir you're an heir of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we what suffer suffer with him that we may be also glorified together as i was saying a few weeks ago listen your life according to your eternal life is not even counted your natural life down here is only about 70 to 80 years and that's it but what about an eternity so are you getting ready for this life are you getting ready for the other one that we got are you getting ready for the life that's why when we receive the life of christ that's why the new birth is so important when you receive the life of christ yes you got to do all these external things but there's one motive that brother louise was talking about there's one motive of that guy he don't want to be out that wire all the time he wants to get to that other side because you know what it doesn't matter how much faith he's got he's on a tube about that big around he wants to get out there where he's on flat ground where he can stand on his two feet that's the same way with me and you i won't go to heaven and i know heaven's here we know that but i want to be able to go into that other dimension with god where he is whether he takes me by death now that's okay it's just a vehicle to take me to where i'm going you know pull the pill apart take the shell off go into the other dimension come back pick the shell back up and live for an eternity and where we're going to live right here you know where judgment you know what the judgment seat is going to be right here the white throne judgment is going to be right here because this is where they stand is where you did all your stuff you're going to be judged for right you weren't judged in heaven you're going to be judged down here and thank god you and i are not going to be on the receiving end of that judgment you know what you're having your judgment right now come to church read your bible do the things of god you're being judged right now what god said so we looked at justification baby form we know that's chopping off our past sins we should but see we still got to have faith that god will do that because you and i can't you and i cannot forget we were talking about last night you and i cannot forget what we did like god just takes the slate and wipes it off he can't remember it anymore for an eternity amen see if god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again all right but you and i remember and that's the fight that we have going up that statue of perfect man is it's like i was saying last night it's not virtue that you live a virgin life never touched a man that man's never touched you you you uh no it's the virtue of god it's the strength of god it's the virtue that you get from the holy ghost not that you get because you're this all right there's going to be many virgins in hell but if you don't accept the lord jesus christ it doesn't matter if you don't accept him as your savior you are going to hell one of the you know one of the two it's not an in-between there's not a purgatory to go to or something that you get in the middle of and you know one or the other but the work of justification is in your soul then sanctification is in your soul he clean the unclean spirit has to go out of your soul the old nature this is where we talk about the renewing of our mind do you know what you're doing today is totally contrary to god what you're doing today you say what me i'm doing you're thinking bad thoughts you had to eat this morning you had to put on clothes you i hope some of you took a bath right it's all contrary to god that's not the purpose of god god didn't put you on here put you on the earth to do this this is all permissive will of god it's not the perfect will of god the perfect will of god is when we walk into the future home and we don't have any sorrow no heartaches we don't need faith we didn't need adam didn't need faith he was faith all right so that's what we're coming back to right jesus didn't need faith he was faith why because he didn't have a carnal mind he didn't have a he didn't have to have his mind renewed now there was thoughts that came to his mind that he couldn't help hello somebody he was human brother brown said he could have been a father he could have been a husband so he was ever wit human but he didn't have a carnal mind he didn't lean back and say well my mama well my daddy hello somebody i do this because my mama always did it my daddy always did it boy my uncle he just ruined me no you ruined yourself all right so the sanctification the unclean spirit goes out walks in dry places seeks red finest nun and then brother brown says god what does he do he comes in and gives you a new spirit which is not the holy spirit because remember sanctification is cleaned and set aside for service not put in service never with me all right but now it's potentially there the potential is there to put you in service but you you have got to keep that demon out because he's going to come back to his house the bible says in there in luke i believe it is we've been reading it where he says i'll come back into my house cause it's still he's still got his dirty hands around me and you until god baptizes you with the holy ghost you're satan's son because you're not a son of god yet oh in the mind of god yes you are but to be a child of god i just read it you got to be born again you got to come to a place and realize that you are born by the what breath of god you're born by the word of god you're not born by your mom and daddy anymore amen they can't even birth you twice think about that because that's what nicodemus said he said have i got to go back and get into my mother's womb and be born again just like no and jesus was like man come on you're a teacher from israel you're the teacher you should know these things no you got to be born from above how many of us really know that we've been born from above i mean really you think about well i've got to i've got you know i got this and i got this and like i said i get this hereditary from well let's look at the heritage that god gave you it trumps all the heritage that your mom and daddy gave you it trumps all the heritage of your dales and caches that i'm connected to it trumps every bit of that have you ever thought about that because you lean on those you say well i got diabetes because my mama doesn't know you got diabetes because you eat too much sorry you control your own destiny folks i can't help it because now that's it find me that in the bible where it says i can't help it because i think the bible when when mary stood there with the impossible i don't know a man and the angel said with god all things are possible he'll say just some things all things are possible you know what she said be it unto me according to that word amen and then what happened boom the promise of god happened to a virgin called mary but he said he'd give you a new spirit and that spirit isn't god's spirit but listen i'm trying to drive this home because even the ones that baptize and the different ones that are sitting here we look we want everybody to be born again we don't want everybody to feel good we don't want everybody to be perfect yet we don't want everybody to to come every once in a while right i want you to realize you're either born again or you're not and your desire should be to read the word of god come to church we're sheep we have to be led sorry that's the way god said it i can't say it no other way for the perfecting of the saints he give us apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists now that's in the word of god because you know what we've got to believe that because there's some people don't believe it and you know what that makes you if you don't believe the word of god you become an unbeliever amen you become an unbeliever well i don't believe i gotta come to church twice you don't believe that's not what god said right well i think that's your first problem i think what's the bible saying the word of god say i can read it to you out of the bible this is not something sure we have a think about this the other day we do in the economy of this church and every other church they have an economy of of that well we don't we don't want you to chewing gum in church you know and we don't want you to drink any drinks in church and and we don't want you to do this now that's just common things but when it comes to this you can't change everybody's got to be the same all right everybody's got to be the same for satan not assembling yourself together i keep harping on that but if you don't come to church if you don't come to church some of you don't even come 50 of the time you're lost get the new birth it will put you in church it will not tell you to not go to church the new birth can't tell you that because he'll be contrary to his own word i can't change this you say why ask god i know why ask god to give you the new birth and i promise you he'll tell you why you struggle in your life cause you don't come to church i can see it we can all see it it's just if you don't show up for church it's like okay but look folks you're judging your own self it's not somebody else judging you you're judging your own self amen and it's just like i said last night the bible tells us in our age to buy isaf the bible tells us that there's five wise and five foolish virgins and those five foolish virgins at one time they couldn't get oil when i get finished drinking this there's no more there's gonna be a day come when we come up to this church or any other time in our life and god's gonna say that's enough and there'll be no more there'll be no more water there'll be no be no more i salve there'll be no more holy ghost given out i'm sorry if you if you think well you're talking to me yeah i am but it's not me talking it's god telling you what the word says all right buy of me i said bye come and get you got to come and get it draw nine to me and i'll draw nine to you well it's really simple now what we want to do is sit home with our feet up on the couch and say god bring me the blessings no you're going to get the curses because you're not you're not what you're becoming an unbeliever you're not believing just what the simple word of god says it didn't take william brown to tell us we need to come to church bible said it and you know what if god put it in the bible there's no way he can change and he put it in there for a purpose for us to live by it pete come on wake up if it looks like a donkey smells like a donkey and honks like a donkey what is it what is it um hudson it's a donkey we got a donkey that braves all the time he go you know you know you know what do you know when that thing goes you know we don't go where's that duck where'd that duck go no we know that come from a yeah a donkey looks like one smells like one acts like one that's what it is if you look like the world smell like the world night like the world you're of the world but if you look like god act like god you must be god faith and works have to work together amen balance i got all faiths i got a quote by terry i'll read it a couple of sundays from now brother brown says if you got faith you need to let it he told one sister in the prayer line i got it it was reading it just few minutes ago he said sister you've got faith you're just not letting it out you've got faith if you're born again she was a christian lady lady you got faith just let it out and obviously she did because she got her healing but it just takes what it just took a preacher to say hey you got it you got faith but it's locked up you got it locked up by what your mind like we said before brother brown said a prostitute can come across the stage been with a you know 100 different men just to blow life drunk whatever and get her healing and a true saint of god will come across the platform and miss hers why because the prostitute in her mind she said i'm going to believe what that guy says and then see then god's got to say if you believe what i say i'll heal you no other condition but a christian comes up and says oh i said something bad i cut somebody off in the road i'm just unworthy i'm not this i'm not that and you worry about that and you lose your healing because of what because of a carnal mind i hope this is okay he said he'd give you a new spirit all right so so we watch these things and and being being in the ministry and different that you watch i take the 19 that was baptized have they changed some have some haven't i'm just saying you know the 19 and that you know you can point your finger if you want to but there was 19 people been baptized some don't show back up again some are moving on with god i don't have to pick them out god picks them out the word of god the mirror brother around what do you always say the mirror of the word you stand in front of that mirror i was thinking the other day try to say this where everybody will understand it because when i think in my mind sometimes you might not understand what i'm thinking but we we harp on people being um qualified to preach or qualified to do this or qualify to do the other and we say that fornication is an abomination right that's the bible says fornication abomination but now you take abomination we know what fornication is unclean living sexually we take that out of the way because we know what that is but what the bible tells you sisters that is an abomination for you to put on clothes pertaining to a man we don't read them parts so you're under the same abomination because if it's one abomination to god all of them are abomination to god that's why you're an unbeliever when you do that that's why that when you cut your hair you've cut yourself off from god because why because you don't believe that that part of the word's right you don't believe and how many of you you know you you witnessed the people why do you where you well that's in deuteronomy 29 or whatever do you remember 19. well that's in the old testament what that matters in the bible so it's the ten commandments do you live by them amen correct but he'll give you a new spirit that new spirit will you watch those i was thinking yesterday we're in i told him last night you are influenced by a spirit i don't care if you're born again you're influenced by the spirit of the world we brother brown said america had a spirit that's right look at it entertainment we love entertainment we love sports we wear our favorite jerseys we go to our favorite places we have our favorite things to eat that's the spirit that motivates you not saying bad or good but there's a spirit that motivates everything you do everything you do amen now some holy and some is not but towards the divine line the word what the word of god says seek ye first the kingdom of heaven then if you want to go to a ball game go ahead but don't make it on sunday balance balance balance listen the prophet of god had to go to a ball game because he was telling about the guy getting so happy and and a lot of you young people don't know this but if you look at old baseball games people used to wear straw hats not the ones like people wear now but they're they're they're flat rimmed like this not a fedora flat rimmed and with a square thing and it's all made out of of a thatched material go look at all the ball games you'll see them well brother ryan says one guy took and put his head through one of them they were so happy remember oh no well he had to see that he said the guy got so happy he reached and got his hat and if you can't if you do it strong enough you just pull it right down over somebody's head and that top pops off of it y'all laugh if you want to but just go back and put in about 19 30 for a baseball game about where brother adam would be watching baseball games you'll see all them people with them straw hats on i don't know what they were called but he must have been there to see it a prophet yeah a prophet but i'll put my spirit in him it begins to divide the bible says dividing the word of truth and dividing gives you measures right you don't just say i'm gonna put a gallon of milk make one make one cake i'm just well one gallon you know you know like dad his uh his his philosophy is if two nails holds a two by four good 17 holds it 17 times better he just don't know he splintered the whole bottom of the two before so or if one quartz good two quarts is twice as good no you can't overfill your motor in your car now he never did that that's something that i think i did one time so i was influenced by my wife so um i'm just kidding but then the way we are though you do some goofy something and you give it you tell well god that wasn't my fault she made me do that no you did it but they'll give you a new spirit that new spirit will change you that new spirit even that new spirit that's not the holy spirit see you're waiting on the holy spirit to come to make you to make you born again or religious or act right no they got it wrong in the message you got to get rid of the things you did at sanctification those old unclean spirits have got to be rendered out of your soul and when they're rendered out of your soul it changes your mind it changes your spirit it changes your attitude toward who god it changes you the change doesn't begin at the new birth the change begins at sanctification i'll put my spirit in him then though is the holy spirit all right read it right there god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit in him now what if he gives you a new spirit and then you invite all them olins back that can happen because you know what it's not sealed yet i'm drinking this so i can put my dirty finger down in here but why can't i it's not sealed the devil's going to come right back in and make you seven times more religious put you in a message church but you will not endure to the end you will i'm sorry you will disappear from the congregation if you make a move for god and then you stop and you don't continue on with god regardless of what devil tells you regardless of what your neighbor tells you and listen not regardless of what this man telling you because i believe i'm telling you the truth just like brother dale told you it's true for all those years you've got to be born again before it totally changes your life but it's got to start its sanctification because justification look justification i ain't getting nowhere justification is the unclean spirit gone out of you man i felt so good because i believed faith in what i heard that he would take my sin and put him in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again and whether i ever think of him again or not god has no thought of them because he loved me from the beginning he knew i'd want him more than life itself he knew i'd come to one day when i would be sick and tired of being sick and tired and who was i sick and tired of me have you ever come to that yet if you have never come to that yet you need to get born again get sick and tired of what you're doing listen who's our worst enemy the devil no you are you and i are our worst enemy listen god wants to save the whole world and if he saw that in his mind it would have happened but he knew that even if he gave somebody like adolf hitler a million years to repent adolf hitler would still be a killer a million years if as much as he was when he died he'd be a killer a million years from now because he never would change he never would what get the unclean spirit out he loved him brother brown says they said brother brown why did that woman get cancer again why did that woman get the um epileptic or whatever it was it came back on her in other words he said because she loved it it was draw it was driven out by god but her she didn't have enough faith to keep it away remember brother brown said you can be healed of cancer today and die tomorrow what it's temporary but this spirit when you get the spirit of god it changes you and you know what people will see that change people will see that change you know why because you've changed ain't now why people see change because you changed right but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature see he's working on your nature a little more gentle this is before the new birth this is before he seals you where nothing else can get in or out and then he puts you in service he's not going to put you in service because he always there's an option something can get back in and only god knows in his mind whether you let it get back in or not it's not god letting it back in you let it back in and that's what happens you get a brother brown i read you that quote several times where brother brown said we get a real good case of sanctification we shout we speak in tongues or we we just get happy in the lord and then we never see him again now that was nothing new birth that might have been some sanctification going on but the unclean spirit came back in just a little bit later and took him right back out i hate to see that but you know what there's absolutely nothing you can do but just pray for people that's all you can do why would i want to drive my mama tried to drag me to church for 20 years i mean she wanted me saved i mean every mama would want but didn't do me a bit of good didn't do me a bit of good if you come on christmas and easter you need to get bored again if you only come at christmas and easter because that was me the c and e crowd you know the christmas and easter crowd you show up and sorry mother's day you better show up on mother's day you better show up when the door's open that's what brother branham said we love the quote like we were talking before we love the seals and the daniel 70 weeks and what we going to eat in the millennium and what's this and that the other but do you even come to church do you even read your bible do you even pray more now than you did before because that new spirit is going to push you toward doing that it's not gonna listen the old one that got cast out of you is the one that took you in this direction all right but that new spirit is heading you brother brown said you get a new spirit he said your name goes on the book at sanctification what a book a book of religion a religious spirit but you be careful that's got to be turned from a religious spirit into god's spirit because satan has a religious spirit he knows how that is and he'll pile it on you and you'll think it's god because see remember the bible says he wants to sit in the temple of god showing himself to be as god where's the temple of god right here the temple of god's right here it's not a temple the temple of god's right here this is where satan wants to this is where he wants his seat and he'll get it with the antichrist the beast he'll get that seed and then like we were talking about in daniel 70 weeks he'll break that covenant and then all hell's going to break loose but we're not here thank god what we have what got the new spirit and then got went on further and got the holy ghost seeing that you purified your souls and obeying the truth what did samuel tell saul obedience is better than sacrifice so i said oh but but saw but samuel i i brought so many thousand heads of sheep and we can sacrifice them to the lord right oh we're gonna save these two kings because we're gonna make them suffer we've destroyed their kingdom samuel says i hear the blatant of the sheep and then saul tells them all that good stuff which sounds good but samuel says no i told you god told you through me kill them all kill all the animals definitely get the kings out of the way because what samuel do oh what a good prophet he was he pulled a sword listen samuel was not something that just set in a cave he knew how to use a sword because he took them two kings put his foot on one of them and he goes put his foot on the other one wiped his sword off and said that's what god told you to do but you didn't do it he said but now he said your kingdom has been rendered away from you because you did what obey obedience is better than sacrifice all right so that's what it says right here you obey the truth what is the truth the truth's the word of god well i don't know if i see i don't know no i do you get the new birth you'll know you'll know that that something inside of you is pulling you off that tightrope you've been on all your life onto some good solid ground but you got to have faith in what god's already said not what god's saying that's what god's already said seeing you have purified your souls talking about the soul now not the spirit you've purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned or or no there's no up and down unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed you were born of corruptible seed i'm looking at it right now but by the word of god the incorruptible seed or the word of god which what liveth and abide this forever ephesians 1 we talk about being predestinated you and i are predestinated this journey put us in here right here today so you're predestinated for a purpose we know that right in whom also you trusted look after you heard the word of truth how are you going to how are you going to trust in something you never heard you got to hear the word of truth that's what convicts you because if you read a book by um charles darwin you read a book by um some good just to some good novelist that's not mean nothing how many times when you when i was in the world i like to read books and i'd read books by certain authors different ones you know i can't remember one of them but i sure can remember some of the things i've read out of this because it's ingrained in my soul all that other stuff is just okay good thoughts and all that stuff the only book i ever remember that i read that i really liked was i don't even know the author but it was called children or like wet cement children are like wet cement the impression you make before the cement sets up stays with it how many times have you built something on i know we built something at the house and and zach which is grown now he put his little old handprint you know what still there and if we would go up up at guildsville where daddy built that house in 64. we all had our little handprints in that amen it's still there because there was an impression made before it's set up so that's why we need to get our kids we need to teach them right teach them to say thank you teach them to say yes sir no sir yes ma'am no ma'am thank you goes a long way thank you see you there make you feel better thank you but this is all going to happen after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation whom also after that you believed so you got to have faith we read it before we read it again there's that big thing called faith is as louise was talking about the leaning tower pizza you were using pizza and then you took pizza what you got peace on your mind brother must remember he used a piece of pizza as the pyramid then he goes to the leaning tower of pisa which is in pisa italy right and that's where pizza anyway so you see how that spirit got on him this morning that pepperoni demon i'm hungry he said i'm hungry well let's get hungry for the word of god first all right let's get influenced by that spirit that's why that's why when you come to church that's why you are either better or worse it took a prophet that could look into another dimension everybody with me it took a profit that could look into another dimension and he said i could see demons hanging off the rafters when i'd go into a place went to a motel one time and he said i need to change rooms they said why he said there was adultery committed in there and that spirit's still in there and you and me we just go oh it's a good room what's going on in you know but he but he is conscious we were talking about last night our conscience is sometimes just far apart we were talking about having dreams but his conscience was right here he didn't know whether he was in this realm or he was in this room but see that was his gift but see god allowed him to go into that so that he can tell me and you that right now we're being influenced by spirits everywhere you go you're influenced by a spirit somewhere it's which one you lean towards which dog you feed the most is the one that's gonna take listen satan is powerless right you give him the power satan is powerless before the church of god but the church of god is letting him in the door i'm sorry in all of us the little things that we do and the little things that we don't confess look which is the earnest see that's the earnest of our inheritance when we come to this new birth when we come to this getting this spirit of god inside of us and and by that time we should be able to be comfortable with the spirit of god how many of you before you got born again was comfortable in the church put the camera on these people how many of you were comfortable going to church well mama would call me and she'd say son it's mother's day you need to be in church i got to shaken because i didn't want to be in church i knew there was some good people there i knew there was spirits that would influence me to be good and i didn't want that i'm just being honest are you i didn't want to come to church because it wasn't comfortable right you know where i was comfortable where the devil was i was out in the world i was so comfortable going to xyz so were y'all comfortable with the cigarette comfortable with the beer why because we were influenced by that spirit and actually we were influenced by the big one that was down inside either faith or doubt today you either got god in your soul or the devil in your soul one of the two you're no gray area there either the only gray area is maybe when you pass through sanctification but you don't continue on you're going to drop back to that other spirit but we are influenced by spirits we'll get in a little bit more because to go up the statue of perfect man's like i said it took a prophet to go you see that demon of cancer he's screaming to that demon over here for help there's a black streak and he said i can hear him screaming now the people and you know brother ryan said can't you see that light over that person well there's nobody can see no light over nobody right i mean some of you were sitting in the meetings and you were trying to go ain't there because your eyes couldn't see it but it's real today you got a lick of fire and it's not hanging over you it's burning inside if you got the new birth there's still spirits hanging around you influencing you well i don't think i want to hear him again i'll just find me somewhere else to go later gator devil you got your day coming don't worry don't you know that everything he put on us we're going to keep it back on him and he's going to have to keep it on him we're going to get rid of him he's not going to bother us anymore john 14 says these things have i spoken unto you being yet present but the comforter why would god send a comforter who's got oh christine's got a a comforter around her she's cold and listen if y'all gonna go with us on that bus you better bring you a comforter cause i'm turning the air conditioner down you will not die you might freeze but you ain't gonna die but bring you a comforter what but what does a comforter do makes you warm it gives you what comfort the holy ghost is to give you comfort it's not to scare you it's not to scare you it's not to give you the spirit of fear anymore i've lived with a spirit of fear long enough we want liberty we want to be able to feel good we want to feel the pull we felt the pull of the world long enough but we had a prophet to tell us there's three pulls and they're not pushes we we want to push people into it but it's three pulls where god is pulling you as brother louise was talking about that rope but that over there is where it's pulling me and that was good brother louise and brother branham even tells us about how the little boy rode the bicycle on a little bitty board i mean you have to try that don't ever look down at the board if you're driving a car don't ever look across the hood and look straight down into the ground you'll be doing this where do you look you look from here to the door 30 40 feet away from you and you stay straight as a string you all didn't know you was going to get a driver's ed course today did you but that's the truth and that's the same way with god if we look at every little circumstance that we come upon and we go oh i don't know now look at the prize look at what we're heading toward you're going to have problems you that that that um cable is going to wobble there you go because of your life but look at the prize out there is solid ground there's no spirit of fear there's a comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you acts 1 verse 4 says but you shall receive power or dunamis after that the holy ghost has come upon you in other words you're powerless before hello you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me in jerusalem in judea and samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth and we know that means dunamis and power let's continue on now what brother brown what is the evidence of the holy ghost now we know that brother brown said it was a personal revelation to you in christ the mystery of god revealed but i believe he really summed it up right here in this message in the smyrna church age oh grief this is in the church age book some of y'all that don't believe in it just turn it off you're crazy if you do you're doing away with the very word of god if you do away with that church age book you're doing away with an integral part of your christianity if you do away with that book amen i don't care if it's a woman's book doesn't matter brother branham approved it before he died he read it said publish it i trust his discernment not them other peoples he told us the evidence that what would happen after being baptized after being baptized with the holy ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach us all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher now you say well then brother i can sit at home and i can just listen to tapes and i can press play and yeah you might be able to do that but your inside teacher didn't tell you to do that if you got the holy ghost your inside teacher can't go past what this word says so it says you must go to church you must read your bible you must study you must listen to a five-fold ministry amen listen i know people can't get here because of certain um you know health issues and and distances and all that but um my brother was telling me the other day he said there was a group of people that were streaming him for maybe a year or so and one couple decided to move to the church that was a good thing but the problem was the brother said when the sister and the brother walked in it looked like she was getting ready to wash clothes and he was getting ready to go the garden what what does that mean bro they hadn't been to church in three years they didn't know how to dress they dressed the way they watched it online about that who it was the brother said y'all don't need you in church now you need to dress like you're in church now get the slippers off put you on some good clothes and come to church that was the problem they'd sat around drank their coffee and tea and their you know sister didn't do her hair and she wore or gown and whatever and you know even when brother dale was sick and streaming and couldn't come here he had his good clothes on sitting in front of that watching i think we ought to all do that we all not all be in our pajamas we already at least if we can't make it to church you ought to feel like you're in church amen just a little bit of a little bit of wisdom there those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word received it some of you are turning it down because you're acting like it and lived by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men oh that's just brother wade oh that's just brother dale that's just bro louise that's just brother aaron that's your brother bob you better be careful those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin in every age every age of the holy ghost for the true believer i say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it or revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it amen wow just a few more minutes and then we'll stop right here this is where we'll probably start this afternoon matthew 11 verse 12 says from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violence take it by force the violet take it by force the kingdom of god is taken by force you gotta listen it's gonna it's really easy to sit at home and and cut the cut the thing on and watch it it's an effort to get here i admire a lot of you that drive sister trudy used to drive four hours one way to hear the word of god and you know what sister trudy how many times do you break down during that whole 20-something year 20 years not one time she had a volvo that had what three three hundred thousand miles it has to be miles getting count them but you know what god honored that faith and you know one thing's for sure i want yeah i'm gonna give you a rose while you're here [Applause] she was never late oh that ought to burn some of y'all up four hours that meant she had to leave at five o'clock in the morning to get here by nine not 9 30. she's always here at least almost an hour early four hours and when she left that's why we have services at two at two o'clock in the afternoon mainly so sister trudy can get home when it's because it's not so late because if she leaves here at four o'clock now she lives closer now but then she didn't she drove years and her husband didn't come with a show by herself well i gotta have my husband with me you don't have him all the time will you sometimes you tell him to go do something else but she didn't have her husband with her and she still got in the car and you know what at four o'clock i always thought about this at four o'clock when me and you that live 10 miles away hello somebody we have already ate supper went home changed our oh stayed around here for a couple hours and fellowship y'all hate long services but you'll stand down there for two hours in the heat i'm on it i'm gonna get on it in the heat and you won't sit here for oh he preached hour and a half but you'll stand an hour and a half outside talking about everything else but the word of god all right sister trudy though to get back home she had to get in her car she didn't fellowship much she stayed around for a little while maybe 20 30 minutes right so that put her at 4 30. say service was over at four 4 30. we had already went home i'm sorry fellowship for two hours here went home changed clothes eat supper and got ready for bed and she's not even home yet because if you leave at 4 30 5 30 6 30 7 30 8 30. and in the winter time that was real treacherous because it started getting dark at 5 5 30. she had all that to drive and she was driving to charlotte north carolina which a lot of times they might have been some snow i'm sure you met some some time before some snow between you know what she said well now i don't have my phone the the long range forecast says that there's 10 chance of snow so i'm not going to church hello somebody come on we got to get serious about this she didn't look at her app and say well 10 10 i don't think i better go i can't find my cat can't find my keys jun lost her keys this morning but we were praying she finally found him so listen we have a key finding god right lisa i mean really how many of you have done that i've lost my keys brother dale pray brothers pray let's all get together and pray and you know what boom there they are y'all look for an hour almost right perfectly and you know what god didn't just drop them in their lap they had to work for it june had picked up a pile of clothes from my sweet darling beautiful wonderful 14 year old granddaughter hey dana and she had picked it up and the keys were in that pile and she went and found them and they got to church a little bit late you know what that's okay they found our keys we got to keep finding god but we got also got a saving god god will save your soul give you the new birth and what put you in the kingdom of god and then what put you to work put you to work we need to work at this thing it was a work for sister trudy to get here i'll promise you she didn't get up at five o'clock in the morning i'm still going this she didn't get up at five o'clock in the morning go oh shoot i'm gonna be 30 minutes late i forgot to get gas yesterday car was full day before y'all ought to try that sometime like i said before we're not going to get any further you'll not miss a doctor's appointment coach can't find your cat and you never will go oh my car's on empty i ain't gonna make it to my doctor's appointment no you'll make sure you got your calendar mama and them's got a big old calendar and they got it circled maybe y'all to circle some sundays and some wednesday nights put that circle as much as you circle it for your doctor's appointment and why don't y'all come see dr jesus every once in a while [Applause] listen i'm not trying to build church members i'm not trying to fill this place up god wants to fill it up he will but you gotta want to do it there was a time i didn't want to do it cause i didn't have the doer inside of me the paw it pulls me to church on sunday it pulls me to church on wednesday yeah they sometimes and i said i just don't feel good came anyway do y'all know when we in two weeks from now when we get ready to go to ohio let's stand our feet we'll stop right here musicians come that this church will be empty for the first time on sunday in a long time because we have church we believe in having church whether you believe it or not we've been built on having church services we hadn't shut our church down because of cope yeah we did certain things to to do away with covid but we never shut this place down we have service you know what god listen god's got to honor his word there's no honor to say well great brother dale we he is but it's a great god in brother dale that influences him to have church service he always has there never has been a time in my life from a child where we get up on sunday and there's a discussion of whether to go to church or not and poor old mama she never had sex with daddy until now june hardly ever sit with me right she said by herself because dad was up here doing his job well bless god i brought they ain't gonna sit with me today i'm i think i'll just go to the house i think i'll stay home yeah you go and stay home but if you'll come to church you know what you come under a blessing you pay your tithe you come under a blessing you do the things of god not the spoken word church you do it to god you do it to god and then god will bless you he'll have to he's got to bless you because that's what his word says let's read this one before we sing a song simon peter and servant apostle of jesus christ to them that what have obtained obtained not get it dumped on you you have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ we'll stop right here because this is where i want to get to i want to get to confession and profession because look but if i say unto you that every idol but i say unto you this is jesus that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof on the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned this afternoon we'll talk about confession and possession we'll read it out we'll just skip right here just for that confess to admit or declare oneself guilt of what one is accused of confess your faults the bible says one to another confess but what their what is there also though there's a possession to acquire because brother brown said you're possessed of one of the two things you're possessed of god are you possessed of the devil to acquire get to procure a thing for oneself to possess to marry a wife and that's what jesus christ is doing he's marrying a wife amen let's sing a song god bless you i am [Music] [Music] [Music] i you know when you go to sleep there's nobody awake when you go to sleep and you drift off into that conditions [Music] [Music] then you wake up

want you to be blessed by god listen you can have you can have uh some of us have been blessed with with good life good health good money good car good home very material very going to go away one day but you've been given eternal life if you're born again that'll never go away that'll never mold it'll never have to be tore down atomic explosion will never even have to blow and even blow it it won't even bother it so why don't we put our faith in that put our faith in that put our faith in the blessings of god oh brother you don't understand i'm just struggling are you doing everything that god told you to do you the only one that knows that you're the only one that can say yes or no if you say no then whose fault is it god's no it's your fault let's start owning up to what we do and not like brother louise was talking about well brother so-and-so is gossiping i think i'll just gossip on him you know what about you know what the world says tit for tat you know you do this to me and we'll do this to you that's not christian if jesus would have done that he'd have just destroyed the world right you hit me i'll hit you you hang me on the cross i'll put you on a cross you put me in a tomb i'll put you in a tomb no he said father forgive them for they know not what they're doing come out of that grave and he said all power and heavenly earth has been given unto me and i'm fixing to give it to a bride on the day of pentecost i'm going to come in 120 and we're going to destroy this devil oh it don't look like it but he did it you know when you are hit over in a sixth dimension satan has never put his grubby feet in that dimension never has he been in that sixth dimension because that's only for the believers just like i said about the future home he he might be in he'll be around in the millennium he'll be able to come back to the earth and do some awful things but when that new city comes down out of heaven he'll never ever ever touch that city he'll never touch that ground that's been walked on but you and i will for an eternity let's sing one more [Music] [Applause] when time wake up in the morning when i leave my head i am blessed i am [Music] you all know what what i'm struggling with and i've just been really impressed um and i've asked god to bring anything and i've told people anything i have done any gossip i've participated in any i want god to bring it to my mind and i want to confess it and make it right and anything i've done and so i want to ask you and i'm serious i'm not kidding anything that you can remember that i've done or that i've gossiped about or anything please come to me before i'm fighting for my life sure and i want you to come to me so that i can make it right [Applause] confession we ain't got in didn't get into it we'll get into it this afternoon like that brother i said something about a brother you know what i said or you don't know how to say it but i said something about a brother up in tennessee and that burdened me and kept burdening me and you know what it's like brother dale said if he keeps burning you long enough you go oh really that wasn't important no it's always gonna stay there what hurts you worse a great big thorn that you can pull out notice that little stinker that breaks off on the end of that and you get it and it keeps festering it keeps fast and you can't dig it out well that's what it was it was digging at me to get that right and when i got it right guess what i had him i had a what a justification again i had an emptying out because that man threw it and i see it forgetfulness god threw it i see it forgetfulness and never be remembered no more so confession that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon confession will give you a possession you can't have a possession and not confess you got to confess your faults one to the other and then you'll have a possession you will be able to possess the bible says the gates of the enemy listen this world is possessed lord help look in the news look on tv look around this world is possessed with the devil but you know what who's stronger the possession of the devil or the possession of god the possession of god is way stronger than the posit than the possession of devil let me read this real quick that the direct family game said please remember my sister-in-law joanne duretz brother joel nanton nanton in prayer he has been sick with cancer for three years he's really been suffering but trusting the lord for his perfect will right now he is in the hospital in a coma so he can't pray he's dependent on us right now he's in the hospital in a coma please pray that the lord jesus can be merciful unto him and heal him if it's the lord's will well we know it's the lord's will for us to be healed he is a believer and he's also a minister he has two children and a wife he's very precious brother thank you all very much for two or three are gathered in the lord's name there he is in the midst and it's a prayer request and the whole church pray for him and he's actually in trinidad so sister trudy brother collins you can enter in there's a friend there's somebody in trinidad that needs some help amen brother brown said what enter in that woman entered into that mother of the baby that was sick and god answered her prayer brother brown said no it wasn't me wasn't me you were already healed when that sister oh that brother brown no i want brother branham to come back if he prayed for me he ain't gonna do no more good for you than i am right now sorry you gotta put your faith in god we'd love to have brother brown i got his i was looking the other day i still got some of his in on acts 19 i still got some of his prayer closted that brother uh what was his name that just died perry greene gave us these right here were some that were prayed over i cherish them but you know what i'll give them to you if you need them but if that'll build your faith but your faith needs to be built in god god sent us a prophet to what to believe in god not believe so much in him oh boy no the prophet of god is not here so does that mean all our healing is gone does that mean all of our deliverance is gone does that mean we can't raise the dead we can't pray for people can't pray for this brother here no i believe he came to enhance that to tell us how it would happen what would happen and where to go to the bible and to the prophet's message he gave us that to be the final voice so now let's lift up our final voice and let's pray for this brother as we're dismissed dear heavenly father lord this brother is in a coma and he's several thousand miles maybe from us but lord you know no distance lord i pray in the name of the lord jesus we bind our faith with the believers in the building that you'll touch that brother lord that you'll bring him out of that coleman that cancer will be dismissed from his body lord we're confessing for him because he slipped into a coma but we're confessing lord that by your stripes he's already healed and that we will hear a good report lord we pray this lord as the bride of jesus christ cries out to you lord where two or three are gathered lord you'll be in the midst so father you've been with us already you feel comfortable around us lord so i pray lord that that comfort will go to that brother and the prayer of faith has been prayed and lord you said it would heal the sick and forgive us of our sins also lord remember sister crystal up in ohio lord she's having some issues with her body we prayed for her
