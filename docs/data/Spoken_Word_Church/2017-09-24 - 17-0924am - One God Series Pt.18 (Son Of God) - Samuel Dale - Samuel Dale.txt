who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh are they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit because the carnal man is empty against God for it is not

a visitor but sister Kathy's mother has been here before but we glad to have her with us today and read off all the other that are here and we prayed the Lord would bless and guide each one and we'll just get the scripture out of the way and the baby dedication this morning okay all right we know we're supposed to do that so we'll get that out of the way but we read the Bible and get things lined up in the ED and then we will will go ahead with the rest of glad to have you sis glad to have you amen okay you like turning the scriptures turn to we've been reading from John 1 and then we'll go to Matthew 16 while you're turning there I want to make an announcement that so kind of a weird announcements to make but there was a brother sent some money to the church all right to help the people that lost anything during the time like food etc during the time of this last storm and he wanted it to be passed out among the people you know if anybody had lost anything like you you know your refrigerator didn't get keeping and you lost like that not just because we're paying for a refrigerator that quit three months ago you know and then you're coming up and say no it's just something to were that we're the brother sent some money and desired that it be divided among the people and we appreciate him for doing that to her if anybody lost anything then please go to Terrence and let him know and they'll try to take care of the pet and then what if there's anything left over it will just roll over in to the what we call the widows fund it's a fund that we have to set up you know and you said it if I didn't and set it up to where that you could help people that were real needy and everything you know to get through problems or whatever and all it was set up that way so okay so remember that in doing that ruse may get this other one - sister Monica's class will meet at 12:45 to practice also today so I father we thank you for your grace and your love we thank you for everything we pray that you would just bless us with your presence in your love and your understanding this day among each and every one of us we appreciate you Lord and your loving your grace and we pray that you would just help us to walk upright in you and to see you Lord living among us as we read your word we pray that you would come forth and open that word to give us an understanding and we just appreciate every time we love you and we thank you we commit it to you now in Jesus name the scripture reading out and then we'll go on into the rest of the service okay John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now remember how we're bringing it it's not in the beginning something with God thought it says and the Word was God so that's self-explanatory the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not now we know for sure - we will be going to verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us because that way we'll be declaring who we're talking about all right so let's go now to Matthew 16 and we'll start with verse 13 when Jesus came into the coasts of Sicily Philip I he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man a.m. and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God in jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and it's built on the revelation what the revelation of Jesus Christ and who he is once then and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever show whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven amen to the word you may be seated and if we'll bring up the little one she's already been up here some of you were down stars and you didn't see she's already made her trip up here to the front and so you know it's not on the videos I don't think or anything but she came up here with Terence to open the service so then she's a good little girl she hasn't been crying or doing anything she's been real good and we thank God for the little one right amen and that way we can get her around and get some pictures and all so go ahead go ahead brother and pick some pictures and then we'll get into the dedication part of the little one and out maka and Mary with us today and to bring the little one for us all to see her we've seen a lot of pictures over and all like that but we get to see her today hey little one let's see let's see if you're gonna let me hold you now are you gonna let me hold you okay well that back there hey you see all of them people yeah okay now what do we always do what do we say we come because we don't leave in in everybody stand we don't believe in infant baptisms no nothing like that we don't go with that but we believe the Bible said they brought him to Jesus and He blessed them gave them back to the family to raise some that honor so that's what we all do here we all stand together to show that we're gonna stay with this little one to see that she gets an opportunity to be raised right and everything because that's the way it's supposed to be grandma grandpa all the others everywhere they're supposed to live before the child in a way that the child can see Jesus Christ they mean and she's doing good she's not crying none whatsoever but that way we're all dedicating ourselves to the raising of the child no matter what then you think about all of us being in that part so what is her name Charlotte scarlet I'm bad of hearing so forgive me but see I'd all them people out there doing I don't know where they're at father we just thank you for an opportunity of holding a little product of you that you're allowed into the family of our brother and sister that you've given them an opportunity to hold with in their hands a little one that is a cherished product of theirs and we just commit her back into your hands now and we'll give her back to the mom and daddy will give her back to the grandma grandpa and granny's in all Lord we give them back to the families around to raise them but we're to raise them for your honor and to live before them a life that they may see you Lord through the others we love you and we thank you in Jesus name okay good she's a good little baby most of them are crying and everything okay you can go ahead and be seen but we appreciate it appreciate an opportunity I always do too you know to dedicate a child unto the Lord because as I said we don't we don't go with infant baptisms or anything like that but we simply go with the Word of God that says that they're doing and you can be seated all right now so just remember that you dedicated your life to live before this child that's a child can see Jesus Christ because you're the one that's gonna heat that she's gonna see doing and we just we appreciate that we shake the little one that God would give her to her brother and sister to be able to raise okay all right remember now the fall festival one date 28th of October so remember that get everything ready for the Fall Festival and all of the doings well I guess brother Louie so we'll get the date later he's rather burly's preaching today okay he will law the preaching winds did the Lord willing so let him know in writing that way cause if he don't preach windy you'll have to okay okay so remember that yeah now I want to say something to you as a church as a whole and I want it to be understood from a heart of love and grace I keep seeing something baby food is all right here yeah and then I keep looking down and seeing something but anyhow I want to say something to you wait is going into a series on the seven seals alright I wish you would listen to that and try to follow along listen to the things and and watch and you know if you miss a service get the tape and listen of the service we make them for you if you need an mp3 a CD or our DVDs or whatever you need listen to them and and try to understand now I say it like this you say well do we need to understand the seals well as Wade was in impressing Darr winds dr laying it down real strong the seals is the complete plan of redemption now would you not want to know the plan of redemption well we know the plan of redemption all it is you got to be born again well now we've been in that for a long time and like wait for this emphasizing you know we say well all we need is just simple messages we just need something simple to to abide we need to do this and we don't need these deep things we'll wanted the Prophet preaching why was it written in the Bible that's as plain as I can say it and blunt as I can say and see I don't understand why people do not want to follow the prophets message he said on the daniel seventy weeks he said if you don't understand the Daniel 7 dude he said you can't understand the seal now I didn't say that wait won't say that it's the Prophet that says it all right he said well I don't understand that same to Israel well then why don't you make yourself available the tapes are on the internet there's our for you you can listen you can go back as much as 74 and see a lot of things back through dark coming down in the 80s and I let alone something now like our listener yeah you've been here 57 years since the Prophet had and you ain't moved one step that's blond but that's flying where you moved one step where's it stepped up any what are we looking for some magic something to happen I went to God those things would be there but I can't do and if it did happen if it was to be something was to take place the Prophet was to come back something was to happen this was AB you realize there's got to be a foundation in the people that are here to understand we've had 50 years to study the message waiting if you're waiting on something to happen you've had 50 years to study the message I have no problems we're talking about the seals and the thunders and I because I have done I have tried to make myself available to the Lord where he could speak about it but just remember see you say do we need these things now if we want to all go by the grave and keep on going but this message is the complete plan of redemption and there is a change of the body involved right see then something's got to happen to change the body and see then that's supposed to be to work that we can see those things see all right then we'd say do we need it no if we won't stay here I've been said those things people have said brother Dale just repeats itself repeats itself you know who that's far you that said I repeat myself you are the one that I'm repeating it far is that blunt enough that way we're not playing with anything we're trying to be serious about it do we need these things no if we want to go by the grave we can just keep on going but somebody's going to come to a change of the body well and if they don't come to the Chinese somebody don't come to the change of the body remember they without us cannot be made perfect just remember everything is waiting on somebody well when are we gonna get serious enough to study the message and listen to the message I study the message I do this I didn't want hi but is it being revealed can you swallow the truth whether it be my family the church whoever I'm talking to we say do we need deeper things no if we want to go by the grave we don't need them but if we want an opportunity to make a change of the body then why did the Prophet bring the message if it's not to be understood is that straight enough I don't understand this I don't understand it you ever made yourself available you're asking anybody else do you understand this no I listen to nobody else with me that's the way it goes you're cutting yourself off all right you're going by the grade all of us are going by the grave and you know we're getting old enough until it's getting pretty fast for most of us you know I mean it's just about fiest enough to do we need to go ahead and order some some caskets and buy some food plot I mean a food plot bison get your life buy some grape lunch get your life to get you away from that Stern this is your setting that we're all right so we've gone in with the rest of the messages but do we need anything do we need these things is it necessary to say the same things over again Paul seems to say so when he said did it his need for me to repeat these times see it must be for somebody okay now we have been for quite a while speaking about in trying to understand how that God condescended to mankind and how that he begin to create and to bring things into being and he began to condescend down to were that we could understand him right because he knew we would not be able to understand but yet he condescended to reveal himself to make himself known what was his purpose to come down and live with you and I to fellowship with us you mean God is that well where's he at I mean you know were there he wants to fellowship and the very word God in the English language you look it up it simply means an object of worship so then to understand God is to understand what it means about worship and how that we worship Him and serve Him and you remember there was it the lady at the well she said we worship we don't you know you you're talking about something different in other words we worship this way that way and said you're talking about something different he wasn't talking about just himself all he's talking about because he came for the purpose of revealing himself to make himself known - you and I why would we not want to know more about God why would you know I like something happened the other day we gots to tickle about it but anyhow you know you get all upset with people when they say something like I just got through saying well then just remember to get upset is not the Holy Spirit now don't tell me your righteous indignation I'm 77 years old let's don't talk about righteous indignation I like what one brother said and there's two brothers here at the church one time and they were just arguing like everything and they both got up said we're not arguing this other brother he said well you know said you might not call it argan but said both of you got mad and we didn't get mad he said well that's the way I hatch when I get mad you know I just like the way you're acting so then you get upset what about what somebody brings the truth to you then you know for certain you're not right is that black I don't play I don't kid when I come here I'm outside of here I might talk with you but when I'm here it's straight I talked the way that I believe the Lord would want it to be said and I believe he wants us to have an understanding of him and His Word and why would we not want to do that then what would be the part what would you not want to know more about God you mean he created you and you don't want to know him much about and that's beyond me okay let's go on listen now we found out by studying the scriptures bringing it through the Word of God how there's I said God condescended downward to work he could make us you know to be a book to understanding and to see him do it the creation itself as I was describing they're alive Sunday afternoon the creation itself declares the Almighty God the Bible says that even the eternal Godhead is understood by the things that we see right you go out of the yard and you pick up a blade of grass and you pull it up and you ask the scientists how that lives and what it is we get God by justice struggle his hand created those things yeah brought all of that into being you tell me all these trees and all the things and then you tell me that God didn't he put in those treason and and flowers and and herbs etc he put in them medicine right because he knew we would need it so he put in the trees that's all folks we we know a little bit about it don't we what to call it xfinity the different things you hung around your neck you know people I've made fun but you know what we lived right they see because God put those things down as he created he put the healing factor right into the to the very thing that you would need and you just go out and you like a dog and he gets sick you go get some Grayson you know how to do it make you throw up and they can do that you know how to do it there's herbs out there for everything we have need of you when we was kids and you got to coughing mom you ought to do she takes some kerosene and drop it over some sugar and slam it in your mouth and make you swallow of it well you know either you either it stopped you from coughing or you got where you wouldn't go cough no more because you knew if you caught it again you're gonna get another dose of it so one way or the other it stops you from coughing right you see God put an immune system into a human being in the garden as he developed a man and brought him in he put an immune system did not the body of Adam come out of the ground but the words God took the dirt for it stepped he just stepped into it he put had him into the to that flash you know what out of that is the beans and the taters and the corn and the herbs and the medicine and everything that you have need of to live the deterioration of mankind the mixing and mingling the the things of those order wound up breaking down our immune system which you're still what was it the guy was looking trying to figure out how that they were people dying of all kind of things and then he looked at an orange and he saw the mold it was on the orange he took that off and begin to do things with it and you know it worked God had everything there for us when he created that's what I told Matt last week that in the creation in the creation God put everything there for us to look at so that the the Bible would say that even the eternal Godhead could be understood by the things that we see and then why you're saying what I just don't see God you just don't know how to look you don't know how to look you can take this to blade of grass and look at it who created it what brought it and you just see the eternal God revealing himself okay that was the point I was trying to get to last week saying that what God created all things alright we went to the Bible talking about that Genesis one and one says God you know created the world huh you get on over a little since God created or made man you come a little further and it would say God as we went through like Melek island different thing I believe was the one work he said did not one God create us God is the Creator God right he's to create Torah because he's God we don't believe in a Trinitarian concept of a Father Son and Holy Ghost no because that's not even correct there's no such thing in the Bible showed me the word Trinity in the Bible anymore and I'll quit preaching that's just the best way to say it if you'd like me to stop preaching come show me cause you can't show me but yet God is so real and so wonderful until he made it to where we could understand here by looking around us the little baby that now your old timers know that what I'm saying is true this one the baby before the immune systems begin to break down so much you know a baby used to be almost immune to sicknesses because of the mother's breast and the milk and the things that it was eating and the things that was in it for six months or a year but then things started deteriorating in breaking down the immune systems and then baby started dying like everything why because of the sin curse in the garden that man sinned and went wrong but look God Himself the Great Creator condescended to earth to let him to associate with his people to fellowship with his people what about a wonderful God like that see then we read that this great one that created we read there and John that he created all things everything was created was created by him we went to Colossians 1 in 16 where in him all things were created in heaven and are in Earth were created by him and the Bible says for him the Great Creator we sing about became my Savior just think about it he didn't send another person down to die for you and I he came himself would you send one of your children in your place in other words you got a date to set the dial and they say well Wow and he's one person ok sorry about that son you now that wouldn't be a good mother nor father would it now we'd go ourselves and see that's the way God was he came himself to earth and as he condescended the way he condescended was the most wonderful situation that could ever be because he condescended downward to first be a creator and that was the word that was in the beginning we read was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God who created all things the word so God condescended from the form of being supernatural to not be able to understand him but following he begin to come down word towards man and his first form was the word and the word started creating he said let there be and there was who was that Almighty God God created all things alright but then we drop on down into the word and we begin to follow it to following it to where John we're speaking about some than about this person and then he said you know verse 14 there in john and the word became flesh and dwelt among us god himself according to the bible there in Matthew where it says and he shall call his name Emmanuel because it's my interpretation saying God with us but think about it God with us laying in a cradle so we can't look at it that away Kenley but that was the mystery that was the thing that has baffled all mankind how that the great eternal God could condescend solo until he would be laying in a cradle crying he would be a little boy out playing in about 13 he would come up and somewhere in there and he would face those Pharisees and things and confound them with his wisdom they were amazed at the things he could say why because that was God himself then he comes on up into life and he he goes out into a ministry there and and he's baptized by John and the river and he enters a ministry who God Himself said you believe that was God now you tell me it wouldn't because you're not listening to what I'm talking about see if we believe that God never changes according to Malachi 3 said I'm God and I change not we'll see then he couldn't change but he can change the way he's doing things he can in more fee the word says to change in form like one person playing many many parts in a movie or something and that god himself could come down to anton and could stand there and he said unless you believe them i quoting scripture Girija bible he said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins he said I and my father are one did you say there's two of them why do we want to make two or three out of it he said if you're not quoting scriptures if you want him I'll be glad to run him I'll read you Bible you'll find he said if you've seen me you've seen the father well because that was the condescending of God downward to where he could make himself manifest and see then the Bible said he's called in the son of God Romans 1 and 4 as he's declared to be the son God with power and signs and wonders and it said even the resurrection he was declared to be the son of the Living God that's why when he when Matthew was asked the question says who the man say i the son of man am what did he say he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God what I like is the other part of you said well that was just a statement he was making now the Bible goes on to say what he said I am the one that condescended downward to where you are now and what can you call me and Peter called the revelation right by the Holy Spirit that thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God what is a son of God a son of God is simply in terminology as we use is call him an offspring would you know what it takes to bring a son of God into the world naturally or a daughter either way you know what it takes it takes a lot of years to bring mom and daddy into the world it takes a lot of years they've brought Grandma and Grandpa into the world and then down through all of that the genetic makeup would be coming down to were that that child when it would stand on earth then you would say this is James Cawley a son and it would college mom and daddy's name why because you could prove it by the DNA cuz he's our son off there every what if mom and daddy is my mom and my dad my mother was handed me my dad was Sam and that's all they know about him this is Sam Dale so I guess us that's the best way to say it he was just Sam Dale you know what DNA can prove who you belong to it can prove who your mother and daddy is why because the DNA covers your genetic makeup as coming down well I why would it not be that God as he could condescend would he not leave the greatest DNA situation through life and through the Bible that mankind could look through the Bible and see that DNA and following down and see God see him appearing to Moses at a burning bush he said Moses I am that I am and see him declaring who he was to Moses see him declared in the fiery furnace with the three Hebrew children and even the king of ether and King looked in and said he's got to be this on a garden all the way down through those I was trying to get you to see here while back we could follow the Spirit of God through the Old Testament but can we follow the very soul or nature or person of Almighty God who was that standing there as I tried to express to you in that prophet that David himself declared his own destruction when he was when he said had you repealed to take Bathsheba and there he was declaring through that prophet David himself declared he said that man will die that does that the king I mean the the prophet didn't say well it's no no no hold on no he immediately said but you won't die David he said cause I prayed for you who was that back there who was that Christ followed throughout the Old Testament who was that one that would finally come as I said into flesh then and Peter would declare him to be the Christ and who is the Christ the creator god no no Christ is just the anointing okay follow the anointing all the way back then you'll go back to anointing you back up to work that you got to find out someone knowings got to come from something and for that's come from something that's got a voice that's why I've tried my best to get you to see you would it be any problem for us to look if we believe that Hoffman's head of Christ as the closest thing to Jesus Christ well then would you have any trouble to see him standing back down in that form and saying let there be let there be see we don't want to look at God as being real we want to look at him as some kind of a spirit or some kind of something that that's not tangible enough for us to associate with it but there he was in human flesh and Peter caught the revelation to art the Christ the Son of the Living God what did Jesus say flesh and blood never revealed that under the Peter in other words I didn't reveal that to you by my own flesh he said what my father revealed that and said upon that rock of who you declared Christ to be the church is going to be built right the church is to be built on Jesus Christ and who is he he's the word now you don't have any trouble with John 1 then do you why can't you read it this way in the beginning was Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was with Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ was Jesus Christ you want it from the Prophet I'll give it to you right off the tape from him he said it says original says are the understanding that said in the beginning with Elohim Elohim was with God and Elohim was God and Elohim was made flesh and dwelt among us Elohim means the self existing God the great eternal what are we going to believe it and accept what the message that had been brought unto us in this last days to see God and see how real he is to you and I and they're not to just think about what is just the spirit we can't see him no we can't see him and then we open our eyes you can't see by by keeping your eyes close to the truth trying said what I said well ago why don't we want to understand the sealed the Daniel seventy weeks the imagined divorce not the the future home the the thing why would we not want the message well you're throwing that at me hey did you get it I throwed it right at you that goes to everybody in the building why because like I said when I'm here I'm gonna tell it like it is you say we don't need these mysteries then we've been here 54 years why has there not been a rapture well we're waiting on okay let's get prepared yeah that's all I've ever said you can't accuse me of anything else but saying one thing if you're gonna catch an airplane don't go up to Gainesville to the bus depot to wait on an airplane it won't come back you go or the plane is that you go with our poor to that you get where the word is that and you stay with it well I just couldn't understand why have you ever asked God to reveal the word to you I mean if you ever asked him to simply reveal himself to you he might stop of that a lot of that we don't need this we don't need that is it true ask him to reveal himself to remember upon this rock this revelation of who Jesus Christ is the church was built well if it was built by that it's gonna be capped off by that if he's capped off by the revelation of Jesus Christ it's gonna be changed by the revelation of Jesus Christ so what are we looking for what are the seals to reveal Jesus Christ what is Daniel seventy weeks to reveal Jesus Christ but all the people won't his dates and times and seasons and they try to figure this out in front of me and they know they can't do it and they go haywire so they don't get to think right around him on what he said if you don't know future home the greatest message of talking about a city coming he said if you don't get the plan of redemption it's in the future now he was talking about a future home but he said if you don't get to plan a Redemption don't cross the mystery said if you miss it come back to this message and the way I love the cross the mystery of God revealed brother Brown said that Christ could be revealed to the most illiterate person could it be than a most illiterate person could get it no so educated ones missing what about it I'm just being plain trying to get something to you so when he was here on earth he kept declaring the fact that he was the son of man right Jesus kept the car and that he was the son of man uh-huh but then when he comes to Peter he said who the man say that I the Son of man I am Peter said darn the Christ the Son of the Living God what didn't you say I didn't ask you that question I asked you who the son of man was because he knew he couldn't build a church upon what he was talking about at that time so what did he do he said dark the Christ the Son of the Living God he said amen to that he said I didn't I didn't even make that known to you of my own flesh he said what the father's revealed that and said upon that I'll build my church the church wasn't built on the son of man the church was built on the Son of God and who he was capito was simply declaring if he was declaring him to be the Christ Christ means The Anointed One right the Anointed Messiah he was declaring him to be the very creator that created the world and that's why we went through the scriptures then proven what did it say we got over into Ephesians 3:9 and it says what who created all things how by Jesus Christ who created all things God created all thing yeah but you sound like now you got a Trinity going no no you just hold on this that's where it trouble is we try to figure things out and it doesn't work the way we trying to figure it out we get all upset about it the Bible plainly declares the church the son of God the New Testament by the church is built upon the revelation of the Son of God and him being the Christ the very creator of all things and the Bible would say in him dwelleth the fullness of the Godhead bodily but it would declare him to be the create car we just can't think about that little baby laying in the cradle well who was running the world while the baby was leaning great more that's smart and all that God had to do before the world ever begun will speak one word and say let it be this way until I come back then we'll change it and that kept it going well who wakes up the Sun every morning I do that's what my wife says she said honey you don't have to get up and wake up the Sun it'll come up I said well that's all right no the older I'm getting the less I'm getting up so maybe I'm learning something but listen church trying to describe one thing to either life Sunday see Father Son and Holy Ghost is not three gods the Bible says the eternal Godhead can be understood by the things that we see I'm a human being right you're a human being you're a mother you're a father you're a son or a daughter so anybody in here take anybody sisters brother than anybody and you can declare the God here that's being right there before you how many people are they of you not simple in it well see that's too simple you see what we call simple is not deep think deep things is what simple the deeper thing you get the more simple it gets there's not the pyramid come higher and higher up to a point the word that is razor Shawn it's simple we'll see we tried to figure it out instead of believing it and saying god help me reveal this to me I know for years it brother they have been preaching one God to us to see that there's not no three gods who created who let's just gotta be it's a father-son hold ago called my preacher said that let go let your preacher something show me in the work then we'll to see who's right go back and ask him who created who when your preacher says her pastor what are we doing in the International and he comes up and he says well you know well there's three guards so so who created him did the father create the Sun in the Sun create the Holy Ghost or which one created who well they were told now here is our great Trinitarian concept they were all co-equal and coeternal that's in your creed to come on I can read too but work can you have them being : Co eternal then you call a Sun when the Sun has a beginning you can't call him eternal we don't believe in eternal sonship I believe in eternal God run yeah but not eternal sonship I can't be co-equal Co eternal that's not even good English not even a let alone good sense but get what I'm saying who was that back there then what happened in the garden before the guard never come into being what happened that's what we've been thinking about that Almighty God had a plan and a purpose he was going to create mankind create a world create all the things and bring it into manifestation and he knew all of that before the world ever begun and all he had to do was just stand there and saying let there be we'll pick up the Lord willing next Sunday when we get into Adam and where he would say brain Adam into existence as a human being upon flesh and start from there and begin our journey through time I hoping to leave that maybe we eventually get down to the stature of a perfect man to try to go back through that again one time and say a lot of things over again now I don't mean to be smart aleck I just mean to try to tell the truth I enjoyed what wage said there Wednesday night there's only how many letters in the 26 letters there's only 26 letters in the English language and there's no way hardly to say any two words without using one of them over again right then there's no way for me to preach another sermon without repeating myself you tell me how to do it you illustrate how can I bring another sermon without repeating myself then you'll see why Paul would say it's not a problem for me to repeat it he said it's needful for you let's see Church listen I wrote down just a simple little point the Roman says that he was declared to be the Son of God with power as I said even if you'll read the rest have said even the resurrection all of it comes in him who him Christ the Christ the Son of the Living God and that's why Ephesians would say all things were created by Jesus Christ not to just talk about the Christ cuz that's the anointed but Jesus was the very name of Almighty God you tell me any other name that he's got he said I come in my father's name to his father must have been Jesus because his name was Jesus oh that's just carnal stuff you just try well let you explain it just trying to get to a point what is a son of God as I say in a moment ago a son of God is an offspring right that would declare would have to have a father and a mother right and to be an offspring father can't do it by itself Mikey can't do it by herself we're not artificial but there's just remember you're getting it someone else or don't worry about it you're still in the same case don't argue with me on artificial insemination will reminds you you had to get them germs and eggs somewhere so then forget it all right but listen see if we don't believe in three gods we believe in one true and living God who dwelt upon the earth then Jesus was that Almighty God no he was son of God the flesh had a beginning the flesh is declared as the Son of God it had a beginning that makes him our brother that's why the Bible will say he's not ashamed to call us brethren because that's what it part but inside of that man that walked the shores of Galilee was a very soul of Almighty God the very spirit of Almighty God dwelled in a human vessel that we call Jesus see then he was what to be called he can be called a son of God when you know what you're talking about go see what I'm talking about a son of God I'm not talking about a second person they in the human terminology as we get to people James Colley and his daddy there would be two people but really by DNA it's not right DNA so saying oh you mean all the way back to the garden yeah all the way back to the garden your DNA proves who you are see we think of a son because we've been taught that her son had to have a beginning but why not be like you probably would bring it god condescended down into another form the word to be called a son to create and could be called a son of God do you see then walk into Church see what she's built on if she's built on the revelation of the son of God the Bible said Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone then you're built on a revelation of who he is and who is Jesus he was Almighty God made flesh or else your Trinity is like a body ours even if you want to say oh no no he wouldn't even tell me that he was the second person well where is it that a person's personality personality's an individual he's not no second person that around said he's not even the first person that's the best way to say it he said he is the person yeah but that makes you one this no because he as he condescended as I was trying to explain the other day don't do away with that father image and move it all into the Sun that is not the way your prophet is saying it your prophet said he's playing like a child before the father's door it's God moving over into another form it's God simply changing his form that he can manifest himself in another form but not another person I'm a father I'm a son of a pert I'm a human I'm a granddaddy I'm a great granddaddy right but how many people are they I'm just one all of those manifestations is part of my life but it doesn't change me to make me a different person it makes me what I am a son see fit we thought of that we would not have went into the the eternal Sun ships and all like that if we'd simply thought if mankind had a thought that it's not going into another person or another idea of course that goes all the way back to now see at 325 AD that's a long ways they've had to study this thing out and try to convince you it's right no but you see that's what we've been taught we only know what we talked my wife told me one time said don't the Bible say that you can't tell the seasons except of shedding to the trees and the budding of the leaves I said no honey you don't say that well she'd been told it said that you ever heard that show it to them in the Bible ever tub you ever heard this old one ever tubs gonna set on its own bottom show me that in the Bible that's what somebody told you they've got a really nicely one in there that's hard to do but in this plain language people say the Bible says it's better to put your seat in the belly of a horse than it is to put it on the ground now show me the Bible that would justify prostitution there ain't no Scripture for it it's what you've been taught all of your life you've been taught things mama taught me grandma talk where is it in the Bible well mama told me it was dark you find it for me you don't make a thousand bucks find me where it says Everett over said on what's on the bottom in the Bible and I'll be glad to mail around the world or anywhere a thousand bucks from you today cause you ain't gonna find it but you see it's what we've been taught out of their life until the concept is in our mind that has to be three gods cuz there's a guard over here in the guard over darkness guard over here you don't even realize the Bible terminology comes up to finally end of it that's a sonship will terminate the God may be all in all we get to glory we're not gonna see a halo over here in the pillar fire with higher than Jesus over here we're gonna see Jesus because he stood on this earth and said if you've seen me you've seen the father so when we get there who we're gonna see we're gonna see Jesus and who was he he was the word that created all times see the Holy Ghost and the Father and alls not a different person cuz remember you can get into a lot on that right who was the father of Jesus was the Holy Ghost his father or was the father his father all the father was involved with the Bible said he conceived Mary conceived of the Holy Ghost now you got Jesus with two daddies see you've been told and it's still dark its dwelling within you're not the worst the truth see all that we've ever tried to bring or everything I've ever tried to bring to where I could see the prophets message to bring it to understanding is that that word of God is the Creator God and there is the son of God I asked the question years ago to you and you don't like it because it exposed the people the woman here did exposed either so that's all right when I asked I said when I say son of God what do you think about I said you're thinking about 2,000 years ago walking on the shores of Galilee but I said the son of God was the first form of God that went out in the beginning the low cost of speech I'm quoting your prophet the Son of God was to create horror why because when he came on earth he was still creating you know the reason I know Jesus was the Creator God because when he was on earth he was still creating right he took bread created he turned water into wine still created he created me in you by sowing the seed of the word to bring us into being as the children of Almighty God Kars offspring right you realize he had to create us mama daddy got us here that's this part out here inside of there is a being that God had to create and bring it into being the word the word is the son of God because that's the Creator God that's why Jesus said who two men stay out of son of man I said we don't understand what you're talking about son of man that's perforation right but it's a plain language we don't understand what you're talking about Peter he just looked and he said but they are in the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus just stopped and he said they ain't no need of me talking no more to you guys about son of man right he said cause you can't understand so I'm going to talk to you about the Son of God and demonstrated show you he went out through all of the things even the adoptions of things and he went to Mount of Transfiguration this is my beloved son hear him who do we serve what are we trying to bring not another god but God making himself known by his creation as he begins to create he's bringing into his nature and ways into being he goes through the Old Testament he's bringing it down through of his ways in his nature then he comes into the New Testament he stands in human flesh himself Hebrews 10 5 said what a body thou hath prepared me we know the prophets preaching the gospel brought the body right the prophets were the word they brought the word John being the life of the introducer the prophets brought the body who brought the body the prophets who the father through the prophets not another person see that's why when you get into this message and get the people they begin to this fall apart why because he I can still talk about a father I can still pray to my father jesus prayed to his father he just condescended into another phone right then one day he condescended into human flesh now here we're gonna end with it on he condescended into humans legs right John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us the Creator God stood here in human flesh and said let there be a bride come forth as you don't understand what I'm talking about son of man what said one day I'll return and that's where I've always asked to just for the believers of the message to think of something where was anybody even a great Apostle Paul didn't even mention son of man I think said he didn't understand some time I just said he didn't put it in the word so it wasn't necessary cuz he knew not to put it dark maybe some of those things with what he said was things that would he said I can't even say it he never said anything about son of man the greatest of all are the prophets of the New Testament without a little old prophet coming out of Kentucky walking down through there with a seventh grade education and he starts in about forty I know in 47 because that's where we can start with him it's about 48 or 49 is the first time he says son of man because he knew the mystery we see that for the believers this message can't follow it they want to make him the son of man you all have been with me in 1969 when I declared and trying to preach some feeling for the prophets message that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man the Word made flesh in the last days oh I'll get some good smiles here I got a lot of friends in and I kept trying to say brother Branham is not the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of man but when the Lord Jesus Christ is birthed into his bride then his bride will be the son of man the Word made flesh again upon me that's the mystery to take us to the change the change will come because the people recognize who they are what they're doing here is that what your prophets did when the bride realized who she is what she's here for he said Satan will be powerless before you I'm gonna say this and just leave it we had an incident happen this past Wednesday night didn't I told my wife on the way home just as a witness of it they're taking her home to drop her and then going to the hospital I sit right there on that seat and this was Lord what's wrong what's the matter what's the problem I watch the service in the tune of the service the tune of the service was downbeat from the very beginning you say you're throwing off on me I'm telling the truth if you don't believe it it's forget it the tone of the service would down be from the playing of the music before the service to the singing of the songs it was so strong against me until I almost and I'll say this happens Boyd had always let me take the service and introduce the minister no he didn't do it Wednesday night till you see if he'd let me had that we would have sung because I knew there was something wrong something was so tight I sprayed God don't let this hinder wait free that up I'll get out and say something or do something it would have been better to me to got up and done what I've done wanna go and make you mad at me because it was something had to be done to break it Wade preach the message from the seal of the Redemption it broke it right down but it was still not right we went outside and June's mother fell over well I guess you noticed I didn't run the mom said brother they're down on his knees all that time I stayed right to her side with my hand on her side and you I said Satan this is what it is I fought you all that's not how you take your hand off she just started reviving up I tell that for the glory of the Lord what do you believe it or not cold I knew sitting right there there's something taking place that ain't right see he was fixing to manifest himself in a great way they never declared that she stopped breathing but you know she stopped breathing they know that her heart was not right in time because he was feeling up here it's the understood Satan now I know boy you've been exposed I knew you were here doing wrong to start with because he was controlling everything you get offended at that I would advise you not to it might be that it was the Lord don't credit it as being anything else I'm just telling it like it is cuz you see I believe the bride of Jesus Christ not no one person I believe the bride of Jesus Christ in this life days will be the Word made flesh and that'll bring about the resurrection but it's got to come first we're not changed the dead Christ on the first Indochina you see when we learned that Satan King controllers yeah but brother Dale I'm afraid what are you afraid of then Jordan brought up my head from death you think I'm afraid yeah but people have died yeah rudran said I don't care if a thousand dies tonight I'm pretty far he's not be back tomorrow not pray it something of that right there's people died with brother Branham preaching things right it's trying to get you to see who you are cause may I state it on this way what's gonna happen a day comes when you have a split second that means life or death now what are you gonna do come on musician what are you gonna do you ain't got time to pray oh I'll pray you ain't got time to pray a split second Saul it is between life and death what are you gonna do can I quote the Prophet he said Joshua did not have time to he said because he knew that he was prayed through before the foundation of the world that's what your prophet said about Joshua she all he had to do is just say it it's gonna come a time you're gonna see what I'm talking about one day you're gonna face death in somebody yourself or somebody else and all you got is your word to speak all you got is to believe it and say it I walked up to cross the driveway years ago my wife had been having a lot of trouble not problems in her body a voice said you say what it'll be and that's what it'll be I said but Lord I just can't see that I'm there to be able to say that it reminded me you say and that's the way it'll be I said what I can't I walked into the house my wife was violently sick from what was bothering her what would have been the difference that I am saying at least even just tried it come on even just tried it instead and let it be what you see no more will I do that it may be me and may be trying but from now on it'll be straight down the line cuz I've done seen God do too much and he's doing it through his people you say but that could have been anybody praying thank God you said that that could have been anybody praying and a lot of people were praying but you know what it could have been what you don't like it could have been one of these little children oh but not with me I'm not fed it you've seen people strut I'd once said it it might be one things little children is the one that said it and God heard them and that's heard their prayer not senior T's or what you think you are it's how do you believe God now me ending it by saying this much what are you telling that brother Dale I'm talking about the bride of Jesus Christ is the son of God made manifest listen now it's got to be a finish to it he's the son of me and made manifest because that brings her back to the faith of fathers but the son of man must come on the scene to change the bodies because that's what he come far we've had Redemption all the way down through the ages right we've had salvation we've had the thing we've had the great anointings right but there ain't no change you think we're gonna change weather there why can't I think they what are you gonna do you know one thing of the other now brother Howard Carroll said this one time that's quoting him and he said I'm either going to the grave or I'm going up pretty quick one way or the other because he knew thought age he's 80-something years oh he said I'm going one way or the other well why not believe that we just gonna take control of which way we go and why can't we just say let her be me I'll quote your prophet he said if it would for the fact that God had holding you by power he said you have within you the power to create a world to go live on I said it's holding a god himself he didn't say we didn't have the power ever child of God has not power but is given authority to use God's Word we don't worry about power power without character satanic but power with character is fit to rule what about it listening or we got really anybody have a need see God is with his church the son of the Living God is with us revealing himself I mean [Music] what the sisters come [Music] coming let's break with our sister because that's what she asked for she asked for everybody to build it but we just get two
