you for your healing atonement and we praise your great name so have your way now and just guide each one and Lord let our understanding be opened because that's the desire of our heart we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen if you'd like turning your scriptures turn to first Peter 1 that we've been reading and this is kind of an injected message alright so we're going to change the scripture that we will be reading 1st Peter 1:22 and 23 then we're going to first kings and kind of jump over because it a little thought I've got in mind I want you to get and I believe that it'll be very interesting to see how well the Scriptures light together and maybe you do that see I don't bring these things out a lot of times because it just maybe it's for me but I'll see the word lay together I like to see it here here and here and then I don't have to worry about it all right because I know it's true this compares to this this here and now all of them comes out to be and to bring forth the same point all right so let's go to first Peter 1:22 and 23 then we'll go to first Kings 18 all right seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being warned again not of corruptible seed now how are you born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by what by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever so how are you born again by the Word of God that is incorruptible and that's why it's so important to hear the word and truly then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word so it's very vital to hear that word preached correct clear come on maybe that's why I wrote a renter would make that statement you know he said you know there's not so many new burst he said because I'm putting a couple of quotes together but false prophets will bring false verse he said true prophets will bring the birth of the word so then we follow the word and try to understand that alright let's go down to 1st Kings 18 and you'll see immediately when we get started of what we're dealing with we won't read all of this but this was the time when bail and they come and Elisha it had been called to a showdown and as it come to the showdown then here's what was happening verse 36 and it shall come and it excuse me and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice I remember they had done went through the things happening the prophets of Vail couldn't bail couldn't get nothing to happen and all like that then Elijah restores the altar the things happens and then a wonderful situation comes to pies and it shall come to pass and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the Prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at thy word now he'd seen a vision he's fulfilling the word making it take place know what hear me o Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned their heart back again and then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed two burnt sacrifice in the woods and the things and all like that happened in the doing you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I said I want to kind of put a little message in that will help us to understand and things in us as I said I like to see Scripture compared with Scripture you know to find something in one place is good wonderful great praise God but to find it in many places it gives us more more of a purity for knowing what is taking place all right now this Elijah we know in the Bible that the spirit not to man the spirit of Elijah is promised in the Bible to come forth five times all right it was Elijah okay then Elijah all right then John the Baptist reviews the scriptures and I and then the fourth coming of Elijah to be the to the Gentile dispensation and the fifth time is one of the two witnesses going to Israel is the spirit and power of Elijah now for that we want the understanding of seeing how perfect then the word is God loved that spirit may not necessarily the man see cause it's a different man each time it's not the same man in reincarnation or something you know we don't believe in that but it's the person who who fits the the bill of the time and what's taking place you know in the doing that we would divide it then as to the coming of Elijah okay now we know that Elijah had four miracles Elijah had eight miracles okay because the lied Elijah had a double portion okay because those were coming into that line all right then it's promised in Isaiah 40 of the coming you know the voice of one crying in the wilderness go that's what John declared himself to be when he came forth and as he came forth in to be the spirit of Elijah coming in that day all right then we know that it was promised throughout the word for him coming that away okay alright like I said now you go to Luke 1:17 and you'll find that it's declaring melikhaya four has to be a part of the Word of God and that's what we'll tie to in a minute because I want you to look at something it's very amazing how everything if you look at it it will compare exactly okay all right we won't be dealing with the first coming of Elijah as much just mention it Makoto's got to be brought to lay down the story and not the second time but the third and the four time of the coming of Elijah it's so amazing how much similarity or ever how you use those big old words I'm not too good on education but the the kind of comparing one with the other and how they compare to each other and to see how that it fits now you're going to how to listen when we get to the end because we're going to hit a little spot that maybe you hadn't thought about comparing but I like to compare things to where that I can see it if I can see it in one place and comparing it in another you know I've got a double confirmation right see then my hopes is built more on that to line it up so what we're going to be doing is comparing the spirit and power of Allah Allah or Elisha either one you want to use the wording code it's interchangeable in the scriptures in the days of John the Baptist and how that he was to come and what he was to do alright then move from that over into our day and see you know how it compares with that day this is exactly in comparison to it and it'll come out - I'm hoping you'll follow it to the line that that I'm trying to bring it because like I said it's just an injected message into the point I've been on the statue of perfect man man now for quite a while well we're going to kind of inject this message in because I believe it will help us to understand where we're at and what's taking place and has taken place in our a day all right now so they said now we're not concerned much with Elijah but yet it does say you know in Malachi 4 how you come and turn the hearts of the children to the father's you know the the father's to the children the children to the father's and things like that that would be in laying in the order and then we read in the Kings that when Elijah comes to this point and he's challenged or brought on this point you know to to perform and God performs and consumes the whole water everything you know we know the story and Elijah then he knows and he sees and he said and it says of that and we rather said let it be known that their heart is turned back alright back there now God is looking forward to show us way over here in the four thousand close the years later something comparison that this that it's going to take place that he's going to let them see that their heart has turned back all right now back guard they had gotten away if you read the story and get the comparison they had gotten away from God and went after two different things and that's why bale gets involved and all of the things that's happening and when it does it comes down and he's telling them to let it know that their heart has turned back to the word the word of that day you know to the god of that day all right now that comparison comes down but what's the comparison as we go a little bit further into the scriptures to line things up all right we know then that John was promised to come in the scripture because if isaiah 40 you know the voice of one crying in the wilderness you know all of those things was promised in the word that John would come all right and turn the hearts I mean and coming and introduced the Messiah that would be his job would be to introduce the Messiah that's what I want you to watch in a minute because there's a lot of difference between introducing the Messiah and the Messiah itself and what transpires so listen to the point now and and I believe it'll help you to understand the very hour that we're living and the things that has transpired so see that John he's born you know and there's you remember his dad mom Knoll age and and he was told to name him John and all and then when it when it comes to Pais that John and the Lord Jesus or what about second third cousins in the line of natural type of lineages coming down of course you can't run lineage to Jesus you run it it comes to Mary you can't come to Jesus with Joseph because Joseph didn't have anything to it but it's just a comparison or a thought all right so then John when he comes on the scene what was John's job trying to cut it a little short I've got a lot written down and gave them a lot of scriptures but we're trying not to do that because they were they're kind of shy on the pole back there are they with the others being gone in time so we will kind of keep it as close as we can all right but John understands his message what is his message and he shall go before him and the Spirit in the power of Allah or Elijah to do what what was the basics of John the Baptist now what was the basics of his time and what he was doing and then you'll see exactly that that lays down to the age that we're living worth it there you see why we like so much emphasis upon God sending a prophet in this day and the things because it compares exactly if you'll follow it between John the Baptist's and the spirit in the paradise and brother Branham coming with a spirit in the power of a life to come to do those things all right but let's watch it unfold called there's a few little things in between that if you don't see correctly you're not going to get it all right the cause like I said melikhaya mankind read Malachi that read it and read it where did they ever pick out that they was going to be a coming now we knew the Scriptures I say this a lot of times because you you you don't think that we understood a lot but I've told you before and whether you believe it or not the first time I read the Bible to read it through I came to Malachi 4 3 & 4 and in that I told my wife I said according to the my my understanding you've got Malachi 3 in Malachi 4 I said according to my understanding there's going to be two prophets come before the end of the world I could see that by reading the word and believing it you know we read the scriptures we believe that we taught in the scriptures and the different thing but the best mankind can do will say okay now this is the West done that they take Elijah and they'd have Elijah to introduce Jesus which is right all right and have it to come to that point of the introducing of Jesus and they knew that melikhaya had a split part about it because it says turn the hearts of the father's to the children and then said then the children to the father's so that's two things all right see now we could follow that and study in the scripture so instead of get when you know we couldn't figure out about how it was to be five comings of Elijah we didn't have all of that figured out we couldn't understand all of those things we could just understand a comparison between this and this to see and to see that the voice of one crying in the wilderness would be John the Baptist to introduce the Messiah alright because that was his job you remember Stan after behold the lamb of god it takes away the sin in the world he came to introduce the Messiah and you know that was his full message come on John never preached no a whole lot of messages all John Don was introduced to the Messiah maybe we're missing the spirit and the power of Elijah test a little bit to understand him because we're afraid to use it we're afraid to step up and say this is that to get to point John's message was to introduce the Messiah right so he says behold the lamb of God the taken whether Senate work they asked him said who are you are you this are you that are you Elijah he said no now watch him cuz if he just said he was Elijah then where would the other four fall so we couldn't do that he had to say no he said I'm not the Elijah alright they said well who are you then he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness which that was Isaiah 40 right so he declared himself to be in the word right he declared himself to be and what he was come to do was to introduce the Messiah okay now once he introduced the Messiah he was off the scene right now where is your turning the hearts of the children the father's to the children because the lodge is supposed to do that John the Baptist Elijah spirit and power of Elijah according to Malachi 4 we'll read that in a minute right we read it enough to in order to be enough if I want to pull up number one that's number one on the list do we really read the scriptures and follow it or do we just read what we want our we heard somebody else say run so what does it say behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord okay that means it's going to be a long time before the coming of the Lord and what and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and all you hear about that is that he turned the Old Testament to the New Testament alright that's good well what do you mean and mustard John how to do with turning oh we can find as he introduced the Messiah don't misunderstand me now and get it in the right order I'm trying to make a point that to me would be very valuable if you'd listen to it it's like I've told you the other day I mentioned that the sister said you said you held that said how could you hold it we'll see I hold a lot of things because maybe they're not important to you I don't know but I choose to bring them at specific times not to try to be anything of myself but to know and understand that we were supposed to study the word I mean I'm not joking me telling you or trying to make anything out of my ministry or live or whatever then ain't got nothing to do with it I wish you'd place all that aside and just believe and listen to see what God has to bring to us because I'm gonna ask you a few questions and let's see what your answer is see when I said it I saw that that's what I asked I told my wife that would have been 19 and 58 right about there cuz we got married in 58 and I joined the Baptist Church somewhere in the 58 cuz it was after we were married alright so we got married in August it may have been 59 alright okay the point is I told her that because I could read God's Word and see that if Malachi 3 we could follow a little bit of it but to see Malachi 4 the only thing we could do with Malachi 4 was to pick out that John the Baptist see we taught this in the Baptist Church where words everybody add you don't hear anybody talking about what they before oh we're so wrong I was wrong a lot of times there's a lot of things we had robbed because we knew Melek aisle three would to be fall on John the Baptist and we could move it over into Malachi 4 and pick up the first part of Melek I floor and make it fall over to the coming of John the Baptist all right then when it did we could follow the scripture we could follow the scripture if you ever talked to a Baptist or anything like that to try to define some of those things they would immediately take you they would immediately define to you that John the Baptist his important part was to introduce the Messiah he didn't come preaching great long lengthy messages and having things he never had one sign not one miracle is recorded under John the Baptist but we could immediately go down so Paul you know what they don't have it but we could immediately go to this scripture and define John the Baptist as having a job Luke 1:15 talking of John oh no I thought they pulled it up so they're good on it they don't have to do that but in yeah speaking of John the Baptist says for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb all right we want to go with that right and look what it says and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God then we read the scriptures many other children of Israel he still turned to the Lord their God then once and he shall go before him Christ right in the spirit and power of Elijah this is John the Baptist now to turn the hearts of the father's to the children that's exactly the first half of Malachi 4 go to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the Old Testament site to the New Testament don't ask you one question how many people did John the Baptist turned to the New Testament message he didn't turn all Israel call all Israel rejected all Israel rejected as a whole rejected John the Baptist crucified him right listen are you listening this is simply cut them computer brains off put them on hold and say ah what is this guy talking about now you stand up and you tell me how many converts John the Baptist hat you'll find this too few we couldn't name him off we could get to it there's just a few though because John had his converts and they went to John you remember to iron the scripture and they said John you know this we found this man over here and John says there he is you go follow him maybe two or three of them how many did John turn to the Lord Jesus maybe one or two other disciples was in the group but he never turned Israel Israel never got turned to the New Testament message there's a long gap between John and the New Testament message at least three and a half years you know pretty maybe okay if you don't get technicals see that's why I love the word I love it because you can't argue the word you can argue with me in my thoughts all you want to but when that word is there you can argue I'll just ask you a simple question because that's what it says and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God now how many did he turn should have relative because it names him in there of John's disciples he had disciples they were following him and two or three of them it lists them in the scriptures as being turned over as John says follow him right turning them over to that okay and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah Elijah to turn the hearts of the father's to the children I now ask the good Baptist this one and he's daughter immediately gonna tell you the next stage and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready that people ready people prepared for the Lord you come to introduce the Messiah now what does Malachi 4 say turn the hearts of the father's to the children Luke 1:16 says that's what John was to do you ask the good Baptist say well what about the life part of that to turn the hearts of the children to the father's they say John turned the fathers of the Old Testament the father's to the New Testament message and then they'll put it down till you tell you that John the Baptist turned them back now how did he what did he do because of this description and the disobedience he he turned them this way and they say he turned them that way you know what that would do that a turn that would be John turning into the New Testament message and immediately turned them back to the Old Testament talk to people this message have very few people even understand that I'm sorry it's just truthful I'm warning you to see the scriptures and how they unfold and make such a marvelous beautiful picture if we can see it unfold and you can see that all the way down through there I had understanding of things to see to try to get few to see because how many converts did John have just a few and all he could do was turn them to Jesus now watch then what did Jesus did once John turns to behold the lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world now what's the listen listen to the rest of the message now John goes off the same Jesus comes on the scene Jesus preaches for three and a half years and has 12 converts and one of them is Judas right come on he had a whole lot more but they left him where were they out come on the best you can do is even after the death burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus the Bible said he was seen of 500 brethren reward to 380 go because took 10 days later the Upper Room experience or some worth a few days later of the baptism of the Holy Ghost can come on 120 500 and CD master is raised and didn't believe it he didn't turn their hearts back but listen to what I'm saying what was John turning what was John's message to introduce the Messiah it was not a preacher doctrine he preached nothing he just pointed him out and that was a fulfillment of Malachi 4 as the first part to turn the hearts of the father's to the children for three and a half years the Lord Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom wound up with a - with a dozen converts to walk with him at that time and one of them was Judas and that's pretty bad and showing you the devil can go along with a lot of things I mean it converts to Jesus get 120 out of all of it is all you can come up with but you know what during that hunter during that three and a half years it only got at the end of the ministry of the Lord Jesus in the Book of Luke when the two was on their way to Emmaus and he talked with him and was made known unto them by the breaking of bread they turn around that's after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus right they're going they turn around and they run back to Jerusalem to find the others the others are what eleven of them ten nine of them then and they get back there and they say in Luke now that he was made known in the breaking of the bread and said think these two times in the Luke are together and says he opened our understanding of the scriptures right they come back to Jerusalem get together with the others may have gained two or three people by the end I'm not arguing with you I'm just trying to preach to get you to see to see the small amount then maybe you will realize one day that fear not little flock but when they come back and jesus walks among them after the two from Emmaus gets back together with the other and they're in a little group and Jesus walked among them and they see him and understand and the Bible says he opened their understanding of the scriptures I'm trying to prove a little point to you if you'll think about it you'll listen to it and consider it for later then you'll see why that when the disciples were born again they didn't just start down here they were already up here brotherly kindness because he opened their understanding of the Scriptures he declared what is that other one or the Prophet don't blaspheme his name born by the breath of God and how that Jesus breathed on them there in the scriptures and said receive you the Holy Ghost they didn't get it then did they didn't get it right then right that's where we can take it and make it say what we want to you can make it so without is he opens our understanding of the scriptures and here it says he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost the Prophet said they didn't get it he said it was a promise I'm because Jesus Christ had not died yet he gathers with them listen then now you come to the book of Acts he gathers whether Mary you know just prior he opens their understanding of the scriptures he does all of the things to him anything has to go away and they're still standing there saying are you gonna return the kingdom to Israel at this time he says not for you to know that just that's gone go back to Jerusalem and wait I'll come back and everything you'll understand everything now my point okay point point means stop think for this a little bit so home computers and listen for a min don't try to figure out what I'm saying just listen the third coming of Elijah for John the Baptist he introduced the Messiah and went off the scene he's not seen no more the rest of the story the disciples are turned to the Lord Jesus some that were John's disciples were turned to the Lord Jesus then the Lord Jesus started the message of the kingdom of the new birth the things that would take place what would happen but just remember my point Jesus had one had 12 John may have had three or four Jesus had twelve that's all you're dealing with it's not covering when it says turn the hearts of the fathers to the children it's not the Old Testament being turned to the New Testament message it's a handful of people that are being turned and it took Jesus three and a half years of preaching to them the kingdom until they finally begin to understand and say now we understand that nobody has to teach you we're finally getting to understand what you're talking about he said okay you're understanding what I'm talking about now let me tell you I got to die I've got to die now and come back in you because you can't do it what you got they could even approach him after the resurrection to say we went through the fact of our understanding being opened we went through the fact that you prayed on us and told us he said but you're still not right go to Jerusalem and wait what are you getting at I'm getting at one thing when was the church turn on the point from the fathers to the children when did that take place the disciples went through all of the things that they were doing but they're still not turned back they're following the best they can do they're walking in the best they can do they're saying we believe it he opened their understanding to the scripture he breathed on everything but they still couldn't talk about any faith that they had because they had none they had at that point a mental concept or faith for the time even the best it could be done of their understanding being opened by the Lord Jesus they were still faced for the time because the Holy Ghost had not been given now we come to acts 2 the best could happen then out of it best that could be proud of the kingdom from the time the Lord Jesus started to the finish was play of one of them being the devil he dies what happens there's 120 in the upper room so they came to the ground right they gained a little ground the disciples begin to gain a little ground I wish you'd listen to that for a minute and think about it Jesus got John gotta we'll say five distance a number Jesus got 12 and there's 120 sitting in the upper room it's beginning to increase all right the Holy Ghost falls on the 120 they received the new birth they had been taught and tutored so they didn't have to start if babies they'd been taught and tutored the Holy Ghost could fall on them where it says Holy Spirit right here see we're gonna get to where the Prophet made a statement maybe this evening you come all this way they ain't got holy God we're gonna try to put together some thoughts and ideas but this is the injected messages I want you to look out if you ask most people what happened well John come to introduce through Jesus it was the heart of the children you know the fathers turned to the children John introduced the Messiah but who opened the door to the church the Lord Jesus told him to go to Jerusalem and wait they waited till the Holy Ghost fell on them 120 of them 120 they went outside because they received the Holy Ghost got a new birth they were put in the body of Christ and Peter was far enough to be the spokesman because I never read your Bible you want to read it sometime go read about the Holy Ghost falling on the dead Pentecost in 120 you know and get that but we just blanked that out and jump over and here we go who did the 3000 outside later receive the word from not the Lord Jesus see when the Holy Ghost fell on Peter he could tell them what the new birth was he could tell them then what Jesus had spoke and said to Nicodemus you must be born again Peter could start following the scriptures and exhorting upon the Scriptures come on you didn't never read between there's a little faster difference between acts one and the Holy Ghost falling one through four and two 36 37 38 before the Holy Ghost follows on the 3,000 wait a minute cuz we can own tax to it you know but you remember acts 1 that's where the Holy Ghost fell that's according to the Bible now and once they go outside Peter preaches a message that takes I forgot how many verses probably about 30 verses between the point of the Holy Ghost when they ask him what must we do to be saved he preaches them a sermon I thought John the Baptist was the one to introduce the Messiah there must be more to be done - about introducing the Messiah then then we consider what if you just take what he done have introduced immediate said behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he's got three or four converts it goes along with him how did that 3,000 hear the word the disciples were taught three and a half years come on I mathematically count with you - there's 12 of them and one of them was the devil so we take that out in these eleven so that 11 they had to be others that were close in relation because once they get to the upper room you've got 120 right and we hit you mathematics now it went from 11 to 120 Peter is the spokesman for the 120 come on read Acts Peter starts proclaiming who this was he starts describing what had taken place he doesn't use technically words of John you know his name or whatever maybe in that way but he describes what has taken place the God had promised in his word the voice of one crying in the wilderness he promised that in the word he promised in Malachi 4 that John the Baptist would come and turn the hearts of the father's to the New Testament message Church and now it walks the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus spend all of that time and finally opens their understanding of the Scriptures then the Holy Ghost follows they don't come stumbling out of the upper room and down to earth or other people are at and said we don't know what's going on we're didn't well they would have said there's drunk they come out of our praise in God glory hallelujah something's taking place and they looked at Peter and Peter stand up he's the spokesman what one said the other stood up with him well I will give it that away that'll be ten of them standing up they done pulled Matthias in with the time he comes down from here go over here making it back to the eleven that was with him and Peter being making it 12 and here he comes out and declares read your Bible read the entire how many of you he's ever read and really comprehended acts 1 read one these are coming to the Holy Ghost is way over in acts 2 acts 1 Peter describing what has taken place he said God promised that to take place God has said this would be here and John came to start it the force of one crying in the wilderness and he's the spirit in the power of alas to the fulfilling of Malachi for the first part that route the Messiah into understanding then you kind of long ways before they're putting us on come to pison today said god i pour out my spirit actually what happens between acts 1 you wind up being enjoy acts 1 and 2 throws you back to jaw what the promise and all of the coming of the Messiah the end time I'm trying to give you to look at something seriously for a moment instead of just taking up hazard lis what somebody says somebody else a or John the batteries he turned to children back to the faith and the fathers well weren't he get to fight for the father where's John's message the soul you're sarcastic no you show me John's message John's message was to introduce the Messiah the Lord Jesus the Messiah stepped on the scene and brought forth the Word of God then here comes twelve one of them drops off they get another one and first thing you know they're asking them it was not John the Baptist preaching to the 3,000 it not the Lord Jesus preaching to the 3,000 it was Peter come on it was Peter the man that preached this message it was Peter that began to preach that is your faith of the fathers John's not the face of the fathers he didn't bring a message the Lord Jesus was not the face of the father's it was the father's himself he was Garland south he wasn't coming to introduce he was coming to preach he preached the kingdom how many times you want to go through that the kingdom of heaven is at hand the kingdom is this the kingdom is that read Matthew Mark Luke and John and see how many times the Lord Jesus spoke of the kingdom because that was his message what are you getting at just keep listening so it winds up that 3,000 people are standing outside and Peter preaches the message of the true revelation of one true and living God read your Bible how he goes through it he was done this way it was a promise to come this way it was promised to be that way he's promised to be though these things that was to be in John and in acts 1 right after the Holy Ghost fail then you get to ax - you're still describing things and when you come to acts 2 that's why I've tried my best to tell you that you got to have sensible understanding of the Bible to understand it you've got to divide the day of Pentecost to have any sense of understanding of the Bible you got to divide the day of Pentecost you got to divide to say 120 in the upper room that received the Holy Ghost and they spake in town tonight cetera then they come downstairs and Peter preaches the faith of the fathers this is that the jaw spoke of Peter begins to declare the Holy Ghost and what it was and as he does they said many brethren what can we do to be saved what could happen to give us what you got he said repent everyone haven't be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises under you under your children and for many that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call who was it preaching the faith of the fathers the father's themself Peter who was the father's not the Old Testament rabbis and in high priests and and big dudes that was not that they were not turned back to the world why it says over then Cain says many they don't say them all this is not turning the whole thing of Israel back to God that will happen after we leave out of here in rapture the God will go to Israel and they'll receive it as a national partner which we get out of here in a rapture then he's got nothing to do with us that ain't gonna cause us to do it we got to see where we're standing do you understand what is the faith of the fathers well surely in john's macy's coat in hell boy faith of the fathers is not if you want to call it that Jesus preached that kingdom right that's all right but who preached the faith of the father only after the Holy Ghost fell on 120 can you even consider millicom fury in John the Baptist and his message falling in Malachi 4 now his message is proclaimed by what Peter standing up and preaches a sermon about the Lord Jesus read acts 1 and 2 Peter preaches a message about this man because by now he's already not just a baby that don't know nothing about what's going on he hadn't just heard of half a dozen sermon order he's up here where it says Holy Spirit he's already received the Holy Ghost at a great height and understanded and he can declare and then it can be called the faith of the Father then the church can be declared to the point of showing that it can be turned if it's just the Old Testament people turn to a New Testament message you have no point because Israel's not turned only a handful only a handful which is the disciples are you listening who got turned back who is the one that the message come to who heard the three-and-a-half year sermon who heard the messages the disciples not Israel as a whole cuz they don't get it until we get out of here where's the faith in the father what is the faith of the father's we talk about turn back to the word and we talk about turn back to faith of what is the faith of the father god only used those that were originals to bring the word he never uses novices to bring the word that's where wrote around says you're wrong taking them off of a barse to play in a guitar in a juke joint and put them on the pulpit the next day preaching the gospel he said that's wrong gotta tell you they can't preach not me I'm not gonna be dumb enough to talk to you about it I'm just gonna be dumb enough to tell you don't work what's a man sitting on a barstool playing joint muted youth rock music and then covered up the next day and preaching the gospel don't tell me that's in the Bible they went 3 and 1/2 years before they were allowed to preach other than the kingdom is at hand they could preach that message Jesus told him go preach the kingdom is at hand but they knew nothing about the kingdom right the disciples knew nothing about the kid I ain't said nothing they didn't understand what Jesus was talking about about the kingdom because they finished it up saying are you going to restore to Israel the kingdom he said you don't understand in other words he's standing there crying in it hard thinking three and I have yours I hollered at these people about their and I don't know yet what I'm talking about he says don't hurry just go the upper row don't get up a ribbon wait I know you don't understand what's going on we said I'll come back and said when I come back I'll live in you then you'll be able to understand the kingdom and that's what they were faith of the father's is not the faith of John faith of the father's is not even to say faith of Jesus faith of the father's is the Apostles doctrines because that's what we're built on is that what the Bible says now come on listen to me is what I say it and this take what I say don't take it wrong the Bible said we're building the foundation of who John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus no it doesn't say that why that's involved all right but why it don't say that he said we're building on the foundation apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone we're built on what the Apostles talked now according to my understanding now if you were listening let's review you go from John to introduce Messiah you go from dire two three and a half years you get the Holy Ghost to fall then you got 120 they're going out with a message now that Peter is the spokesman now he's telling you what's going on that's a long ways in it well we understand what is the faith of the father's I thought it was the revelation of the father I thought if we're building on the foundation apostles and prophets and everything we're supposed to have it supposed to be built on the foundation of those apostles and prophets and apostles and prophets only started their message on the day of Pentecost oh come on not in the upper room they could say this is that they could declare that God has died but when they go outside they begin to do it read your Bible that's what I'm trying to get you to do read Acts 1 and to read from the point of where the Holy Ghost falls on 120 to where he falls on the 3000 and Peters preaching them a drastic message about the coming of the Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ and then it wouldn't hold a ghost fall in at that stage on the three that I mean on 120 they already had it it was the falling of the Holy Ghost on the 3,000 that had only heard one message that's why Paul and Peter there puts us work as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby what did the Prophet SAV blend statue of a perfect man you're born again at faith but then you grow into these virtues and he said if you don't possess these virtues you're not sealed into the kingdom we'll get to the our this evening oh I was sealed in when I got the Holy Ghost praise God but do you understand what took place no no I'm just I'm trying my best understand what she's on right now well alright just remember if you're talking about the faith of the fathers let's talk about the faith of the father let's don't talk about the faith the John the Baptist let's don't talk about the message of John the Baptist it was to introduce the Messiah now can I cut it quick when you listen for a minute what happened in this life days supposed to be the fourth part of the coming of Elijah was that Elijah back there had Elijah that John the Baptist with the spirit in the power of allies and brother Branham comes as the end time to be the spirit in the fire of allies to be in the end time to turn the hearts of the white John turned them from the fathers to the children we had to have one to come and turn us from the children back to the fathers wented back to the faith of the fathers bring us back to the original doctrine of the Apostles they never had two or three gods they had one they never had it all messed up they had the truth Paul and them taught predestination and clarity wonderful Peter saying you must be born the completer come into being born again I've tried to get that to you to see it Paul preaching a pod option identically saying the same thing of a option a child born into the kingdom then adopted into the family and then goes forth with a signet of the Father that's the same thing as the stature of a perfect man born and again by the new birth and then baptized into the body by the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the gift we'll get to that deceit and I made that statement life Sunday but I don't have time to clear a fight now I'll do it this evening the Lord willing why would brother brendham say I can conclusively prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body when we thought that was wrong he's right we just don't understand what's going on that's why I was bringing this message part I've run this message over run it back finally I said okay just bring it I was gonna bring the evening message and all can't do that here's what it is we say we understand faith of the father but what is the faith of the father's it's the same Holy Ghost coming and dwelling in you that was in them father's you know how hard it has been to try to preach that the Holy Ghost you have inside of you is the same Holy Ghost that came on the day of Pentecost oh now in a way not in a way if it didn't come to way it come under there Pentecost you don't have it solves a problem that's when the brother asked me years ago he said what do you think about the people about this baptism and the Holy go know I said cause a lot of people don't have it that was just honest as I could be because a lot of people would not listen to the word but will we listen to it now john the baptist's never preached a message Jesus preached a message and could not make one convert as far as his fully given him the baptism of the Holy Ghost the best he could do was send them to the Upper Room right but now you show me where the disciples I have to receive in the Holy Ghost ever told anybody to go to the upper room they said this is that they were spoken up about y'all what y'all say the whole book of Joel I'm just taking parts of it right do you see what I'm talking about what if it is folks that this spirit and power of Elijah under John the Baptist would cover him in his ministry and even the Lord Jesus and a three and a half year period and then the disciples preached the kingdom Jesus preached the kingdom was at hand the disciples never preached the kingdom was at hand they preached the kingdom now and give you that from the Prophet you want the disciples preached the kingdom why because they was in it you got to be in the kingdom be able to preach the kingdom that's why I called it over and over to you the disciples Peter and him had to be right here a Holy Spirit are they couldn't no way for us to get there Here Come a prophet in the last days to fulfill the last part he preaches for forty something years thirty something and what and he preaches the original faith of the fathers may I'll get you to compare it the Lord Jesus priests father John and preach the kingdom are you listening I'm trying to compare something so if you listen to be real good if you don't it's gonna go through the aood Jesus preached became him but he couldn't get nobody into it because the Holy Ghost hadn't come yet so we had to wait until the Holy Ghost came to be able to quicken the disciples is one that really preached the kingdom we're not told in the Bible to turn us back to John the Baptist we're not to be turned back to Elias with a double portion we're not to be turned back to Elijah that begins it we're to be told of turned back to the original faith what is the original faith the Lord Jesus Christ wrote the original message what happened in this life days now hold on for a second and grasp because you're going to anyway God promised this time of a forthcoming of Elijah that he's to turn the hearts of the fathers had to come and he was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children in this days to turn the hearts of the children back to the original Pentecostal father's brother Branham preached 30-something years now am i quoting 30-something years before he could preach the stature of a perfect man come on you read the book and find it he said I've been on this for 33 years I think it was he'd been preaching on it but he couldn't get nobody to see what he was talking about he was talking about the original faith of the fathers of the Upper Room with a hundred and twenty not there three thousand people side because they only heard one message and they had to hear that from the Apostles brother branham was a prophet that God brought his message straight to him he didn't have to listen to somebody else God brought it to him not it he didn't listen to nobody else I didn't say that he listened to other people and he took other people in their notes from their time but he went to the backside of the desert and I don't mean the last days just for the seals and he stayed in the backside of the desert getting the Word of God right sitting by itself up in a cave in the mountains getting the Word of God but he preached the faith of the father's a statue of a perfect man compare that to the Lord Jesus preaching for three and a half years and you got something you got him bringing a message that identically compares to the Lord Jesus Christ I said message I didn't say person and personalities and ideas or concepts I said message Jesus preached the kingdom brother Branham preached the kingdom not that it's at hand but it is here he said I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here all right man just been to him well still true man just bend the only one but it's still true so if that come let's compare one more you ready let's compare one more thought John couldn't bring the message Jesus the best he could do was preach the gospel of the kingdom about the kingdom he couldn't bring it into manifestation because he's gonna have to die to do that all this is these things is under John the Baptist Jesus is still under John the Baptist because he introduced him the kingdom he introduced not just a man he said behold the lamb of God not a man behold God Himself is standing among us and someone said what do we do he said go with him that was the best could be done whether the disciples go with him Richi Bible you see that's what they've done they followed him then he went to their disciples and he began as to opening their understanding of the scriptures and as he did the Holy Ghost fell on them in the upper room 120 of them they were filled with the Holy Ghost up to where the Prophet said holy spirit we'll get to that this evening we got a little more a little more the wind to where you can understand what is the baptism with the holy God what you see in the end time you had brother branham to come to bring the message okay are you going to compare with me will you compare one more thing the Lord Jesus listen the Lord Jesus went away and came back to live in the apostles to bring the message I thought we believed the new birth was to bring Christ to each individual I thought we had no right to being up in the pulpit preaching without the baptism when the Holy Ghost etcetera etcetera didn't it odd that brother Branham in the statue of a perfect man says fill me up Lord with these things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brother that I may teach others apostles prophets teachers evangelists to the bringing of these things into perfection and the coming of the Lord do we think Oh John was just that little part back there he just turned him when John turned that he said behold the lamb of God right when brother Branham comes over here and gets it what does he say he said behold the lamb of God the same one standing here today did he say it on the seal book and by quoting this correctly he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand first seal and set out D'Argo's a white horse rider he said dar by that is the Antichrist he was standing right where John stood to introduce the Messiah okay we got that we got two message he's to introduce the Messiah what about the rest of the message now who's to carry it on from his part come on you've got a fivefold ministry if you followed what I said if you'll lay it down it'll type one right after the other one this happened this happened this happened this happened this happened this happened comparing it to the day that we're living to see what to expect what do you expect brother Dale I expect the fivefold ministry to get into the message and receive it correctly and bring it to the people and the people become the message that see we want to become the message that Jesus brought the disciples took that and brought their own message of an inward work of grace inside of their life that was the kingdom it compares perfectly to the end time and to see that God is ready to move on I believe that come on musician God is ready to move out everything is comparing if you show me anything else to compare with of what happens in Elijah and the thing I would love to talk with you but you see what I'm talking about it's going to all work up to the Word of God being made known the things that are secrets that the Prophet would state and make it's like I made it last Sunday brother Branham said I can conclusively prove that you are born again and then baptize the end of the body we look at that and say how in the world could he say it like that because that sounds like two things it is not two things if you'll get back to what happened to the disciples you'll find out it's not two things disciples received the message and it placed them in the right place we still got the brotherly kindness we ain't got there yet we still got a little message called true baptism of the Holy Ghost and we got to the headstone here okay oh we got come on let's damn think on these things compare it follow it look back there and see what happened John the Lord Jesus then the disciples and look over here here comes the prophet of God bringing the Word of God he's not God we're not putting that he's not God but he's the closest would be and he comes here and stands with the word in the last day and then as he begins to introduce the message it goes further than himself it goes into the Lord Jesus Christ to return in that message that he's bringing with both dyers you opening of the seals etc etc I've always talked you the headstone to the church is the opening of those seven sealed I've talked that from day one I still teach you that awake oh that's true but we can even follow the faith of the fathers go ahead well we got 51 I'm one of them anybody have a need there are people almost everywhere harsh are all aflame with a flower that fell at pinnacles that spins and may complete it is burning in within my heart Oh glory to his name I'm so glad that I can say one of the
