[0:51] musicians everybody can go down we'll
[0:52] turn it over to Ryan and let him uh
[0:55] direct a part now to because he's got a
[0:58] little bit he's wanting to show you and
[1:00] talk about the miracle baby then we will
[1:02] have the baby dedication all right all
[1:05] right
[1:09] good afternoon everybody
[1:12] this may take a while get comfortable
[1:15] foreign
[1:17] thank you
[1:19] I'm gonna set my
[1:22] stopwatch okay to stop me at a certain
[1:25] point because I don't want to go too
[1:26] long
[1:27] I'm glad to have my family here with me
[1:29] before I forget cake downstairs after
[1:32] service
[1:33] do not leave without eating some cake we
[1:35] don't want to take it home
[1:37] I'm so glad to have all my family if I
[1:38] could just take a moment to then
[1:39] introduce them
[1:41] uh starting over here in the right my
[1:43] grandmother
[1:44] uh Ginger bonnette beside hers my dad
[1:47] Joel and my sister Brooke
[1:51] and then Carlos
[1:57] and my two nieces and I and Aaliyah and
[1:59] then uh
[2:00] let's see my mom back there behind my
[2:03] dad there and my grandma my other
[2:04] grandma
[2:05] Arlene my mom is Deborah sorry
[2:09] and then over here Uncle Bill where'd
[2:12] they go oh they moved Uncle Bill and
[2:13] Aunt Suzanne Dover
[2:15] now let me tell y'all something
[2:17] that's important to me that I thought of
[2:20] when they walked in
[2:21] my grandma and my aunt Suzanne our
[2:24] children of my great-grandmother Eula
[2:26] who you all know my baby is named after
[2:28] they left Eula and Floyd night they left
[2:31] a legacy of Godly Christian love
[2:34] and that's part of the reason I'm
[2:35] standing here today
[2:37] is because the Bible says it's one
[2:39] simple law in God's word
[2:41] that train up a child in the way he
[2:43] should go when he's old he'll not depart
[2:45] from it
[2:46] they train their children to pray and
[2:48] they pass it down to the Next Generation
[2:50] my dad and mom taught me to pray and my
[2:52] grandma prayed with me and my sister and
[2:54] read our Bibles
[2:55] she read her Bible with us
[2:57] and that's she's part of this testimony
[2:59] if it weren't for that I wouldn't I
[3:00] don't know if I'd be here so
[3:02] um
[3:03] I wanted to give that to them now
[3:06] I'm trying to make sure I don't leave
[3:07] anything out
[3:09] um
[3:10] thank you all so much for your prayers
[3:12] about Ava God did something tremendous I
[3:15] mean not just healing her but delivering
[3:18] me from Fear
[3:19] and so many other things that I want you
[3:21] to see in this testimony and I hope it
[3:23] can be a help to somebody sorry that you
[3:25] didn't know all the circumstances most
[3:26] of you didn't know she was dying frankly
[3:28] I didn't want to think about it I didn't
[3:29] want to tell anybody I didn't want to
[3:31] confess it
[3:32] and like brother Dale says you don't
[3:34] have to know the circumstances that
[3:36] somebody's facing to know how to pray
[3:37] just pray amen you don't pray hard if
[3:40] they're dying and pray soft if they've
[3:41] got a cold just pray
[3:43] and brother Gary Atkins Sister Mary
[3:45] Doherty they're on my heart everybody's
[3:48] Hearts I'm sure we keep lifting them up
[3:49] we don't know exactly what they're
[3:50] facing to every detail but we just pray
[3:53] now either was born premature as most of
[3:56] you know she had underdeveloped lungs
[3:58] that was the initial diagnosis
[4:00] and she got worse and worse and worse
[4:03] over the first two days by the third day
[4:05] she was in critical condition on life
[4:07] support heavily medicated heavily
[4:09] sedated
[4:10] in a medical induced coma and under
[4:13] constant supervision from a nurse not
[4:16] one to two but I mean one to one ratio
[4:18] of a nurse constantly watching just our
[4:20] baby that's how bad she was constantly
[4:22] working diligently to get her stable by
[4:24] the third day
[4:25] now
[4:27] Now by that time all through this trial
[4:29] scriptures kept coming from our
[4:31] remembrance because he said he'd make a
[4:33] way of Escape in the trial and the word
[4:35] is the way of Escape you always go back
[4:36] to the word when Jesus was tempted
[4:39] he always went back to the word he said
[4:41] it is written it is written it is
[4:42] written and that's how we overcome
[4:45] now by the third day I was under
[4:47] tremendous load of fear
[4:49] not the good kind of fear of the
[4:50] reverent fear for God but the torment
[4:53] fear
[4:54] now the Bible says fear has torment
[4:57] and that scripture came to my
[4:58] remembrance and I told Gabby you know
[5:00] Gabby we've got to overcome this fear by
[5:02] this time I was crying okay because of
[5:05] the fear I was so scared for losing my
[5:06] baby
[5:09] now that was God speaking to me and I
[5:10] didn't know yet I thought it was just
[5:12] another good scripture to comfort me and
[5:14] later that day we're at our dying baby's
[5:16] bedside and by this time her skin was
[5:18] pale
[5:18] she was cold and clammy her fingers and
[5:21] toes were beginning to turn purple and
[5:22] blue
[5:24] her oxygen saturation at the lowest
[5:26] point that night got down to 37 percent
[5:28] it's supposed to be between 90 and 100
[5:30] percent hers got down to 37 percent
[5:33] she was in terrible shape
[5:35] nonetheless there was a Bible study here
[5:38] that night we left our dying baby's
[5:40] bedside against all rational thought I'm
[5:42] not saying this to brag I'm saying that
[5:45] that I stood because I saw something in
[5:46] the Bible that having done all to stand
[5:48] we stand and to me standing is reading
[5:51] your Bible praying going to church
[5:52] diligently living to serve God and
[5:54] believing
[5:56] so we left our dying baby's bedside that
[5:58] night or that afternoon and went to
[6:00] church cried all the way here cried all
[6:02] dear and this during the Bible study
[6:04] and most of you know this part of the
[6:05] testimony because I testified a few
[6:06] weeks ago but the white approached me
[6:08] after the service
[6:09] not presumptuously
[6:11] holding his head down ringing his hands
[6:14] you know Ryan we'll keep praying for it
[6:16] maybe everything will be okay no he came
[6:18] to me and spoke boldly
[6:20] and said these words and simplicity
[6:23] he said he smiled and said
[6:25] don't worry stop worrying quit worrying
[6:28] like that about three times then he went
[6:31] on to say some other things and
[6:33] I accepted that okay that was the net
[6:36] result but he doesn't know this
[6:38] but when he spoke that to me a battle
[6:40] began to rage in my mind because that
[6:43] oppressive spirit of fear
[6:45] was beginning to it was confronted by
[6:47] faith
[6:48] perfect love casteth out fear if you can
[6:51] read that on the scripture there amen
[6:53] perfect love which is Faith casteth out
[6:55] fear that's how you overcome fear
[6:57] that confronted that fear and the fear
[6:59] began to be afraid itself because it was
[7:01] being loosed now watch I didn't know
[7:03] this until later on because weeks later
[7:05] after this had all passed I didn't
[7:07] realize what was going on
[7:09] but I pondered these things I kept these
[7:11] things in my heart like Mary and I began
[7:12] to think on these things and God began
[7:14] to show me some of what was going on
[7:16] behind the veil of the flesh if you will
[7:19] that fear was confronted by faith the
[7:21] first thought that came to my mind
[7:22] brother Wade
[7:23] was how dare you stand there and tell me
[7:25] not to worry when my baby's laying in
[7:27] bed dying I wasn't mad at him because he
[7:29] didn't know she was dying see but that
[7:31] was the first thought but what about my
[7:32] baby laying in the bed dying and you're
[7:34] just telling me something so simple just
[7:35] don't worry
[7:37] like Jesus said fear not only believe
[7:40] don't doubt
[7:42] and I went to Mark 4 38 later on that
[7:46] scripture came to my remembrance
[7:48] y'all can read it while I'm talking but
[7:49] just for sake of time
[7:51] the Jesus and the disciples were in this
[7:53] in the boat I see being tossed about by
[7:55] the winds and the waves and the
[7:57] disciples through a spirit of fear went
[7:58] to white jesus because he was asleep
[8:00] there was no fear in that man
[8:03] he laid there sleeping
[8:05] and in the midst of the trial in the
[8:07] midst of the storm he laid there asleep
[8:08] not worrying one bit but the disciples
[8:10] through fear went to wake him and said
[8:13] carest thou not that we perish in other
[8:15] words don't you care about my baby
[8:16] laying there dying
[8:18] see The Same Spirit act in the same way
[8:20] pointing to the circumstances just the
[8:22] same way false evidence appearing real
[8:26] fear
[8:27] pointed me back to the circumstances and
[8:29] then for a moment I thought yeah my
[8:32] baby's dying but this is Faith this
[8:34] gives me hope
[8:35] this gives me peace and joy so I'm going
[8:37] to take what brother Wade gave me
[8:40] and you know Jesus awoke and rebuked the
[8:43] winds and the waves and the winds and
[8:44] waves ceased
[8:45] and then he addressed the spirit of fear
[8:47] in the disciples and said unto them why
[8:49] are you fearful how is it that you have
[8:50] no faith okay
[8:53] so that same spirit of fear was doing
[8:54] the same thing in me I realized that
[8:56] only later now
[9:00] um
[9:00] that night we went home and went to bed
[9:02] I felt so much more encouraged I wasn't
[9:04] I didn't cry anymore after that
[9:06] in the middle of the night
[9:07] the worst wasn't over yet okay that was
[9:10] the turning point but not not just yet
[9:11] okay that God gave me something he was
[9:13] in the middle of giving me something to
[9:14] overcome
[9:15] the greatest battle was just ahead in
[9:18] the middle of the night the doctor
[9:18] called and said Ryan your baby's not
[9:20] getting any better she's she's getting
[9:21] worse and we're going to send her down
[9:22] to Egleston Children's Hospital in
[9:24] Atlanta at the Children's Healthcare of
[9:26] Atlanta where she can get some more
[9:28] advanced care
[9:29] so we went down there to meet the doctor
[9:30] in the middle of the night and while
[9:32] waiting to meet the doctor I pulled up
[9:33] my Bible and began to read
[9:35] despite my baby dying despite her having
[9:38] to be moved in the middle of the night
[9:39] would show she must been pretty bad
[9:41] and despite being a one-hour sleep I
[9:44] just pulled up my Bible and began to
[9:45] read as I did the day before that and
[9:47] the day before that and the day before
[9:48] that I refused to stop my daily Bible
[9:50] reading
[9:51] and you know what the very chapter that
[9:55] contained that very verse is the one
[9:57] that I read
[9:58] in my daily Bible reading now I go one
[10:01] chapter day out of the New Testament two
[10:03] out of the Old Testament and just to
[10:04] show you how unlikely this is I looked
[10:06] this up on Google there's 260 chapters
[10:07] in the New Testament so it's a one in
[10:09] 260 chance that this would happen that I
[10:12] would read that very verse
[10:14] now God was speaking to me and I began
[10:16] to realize that the Bible says three as
[10:17] a witness the previous day fear hath
[10:19] torment came to my remembrance just out
[10:21] of the blue then that night by the way
[10:23] it spoke to me don't fear don't worry
[10:25] and then in the middle of the night in
[10:26] my Bible reading waiting to hear the
[10:28] verdict from the doctor about my baby
[10:30] there came that scripture again and I've
[10:31] turned to Gavin I said Gabby look at
[10:33] this I said God is speaking to us God is
[10:36] showing us do not worry no matter what
[10:39] they're not fair
[10:40] now this is beautiful let me show you
[10:42] the next slide please
[10:43] Psalm 23 later again I realized we were
[10:46] walking right down the middle of Psalm
[10:48] 23. yea though I walk through the valley
[10:50] of the shadow of death Gabby and I
[10:52] collectively don't cry again being it's
[10:54] going to make me cry
[10:56] yeah I mean not collectively and
[10:58] individually we're in the worst trial of
[11:00] Our Lives the deepest valley
[11:03] yet
[11:04] and my baby was shadowed to death yet I
[11:07] will fear no evil that was David's
[11:09] Proclamation or Declaration and that was
[11:11] my mandate God told me don't fear what
[11:13] would be evil my baby dying it put her
[11:16] in the presence of God it'd be wonderful
[11:17] for her but for me it'd be terrible I'd
[11:18] never know what she'd become the side of
[11:20] Eternity I'd never know what color I
[11:21] should have what color hair she'd have
[11:23] everybody agree with me that'd be pretty
[11:24] evil I will fear no evil for thou art
[11:27] with me thy rod and thy staff that
[11:29] comfort me now he was an ever-present
[11:30] help just as he always is and bringing
[11:32] the word from our memories give me
[11:34] scriptures to overcome and to comfort
[11:35] and everything
[11:38] and my favorite part I never understood
[11:41] what this meant thou prepares the table
[11:43] before me in the midst of mine enemies
[11:46] what were David's enemies here fear and
[11:48] death what were our enemies fear and
[11:50] death our baby was dying we were afraid
[11:52] fear and death The Last Enemy to be
[11:55] defeated is death the Bible says fear
[11:57] and death were our enemies okay
[12:00] now
[12:01] God didn't wait till they were at Bay
[12:03] somewhere off bothering somebody else
[12:05] and sneak in and slide us a little Manna
[12:07] under the table so to speak God's Not
[12:09] Afraid of fear and he's not afraid of
[12:10] death right
[12:11] he walks in waltzes in right in the
[12:13] middle of fear and death right in the
[12:14] presence of our enemies and opened a
[12:16] table before me and gave me exactly what
[12:18] I needed to overcome this very trial at
[12:21] this very moment
[12:24] they opened the table before me
[12:26] and on that table was not a seven course
[12:28] meal that was one little morsel of bread
[12:30] he was saying here son you're gonna need
[12:32] this for the battle that lays just ahead
[12:33] because he knew what that doctor was
[12:35] going to tell us when she walked into
[12:37] the room
[12:39] portion of bread was this that fear hath
[12:42] torment and no matter what the outcome
[12:44] of your trial you will never be
[12:46] benefited by fear so cast it down it's a
[12:48] disease it's a spiritual disease that
[12:49] only Dr Jesus can diagnose you with okay
[12:51] like depression which I've also overcome
[12:54] years ago now he Walters into the room
[12:57] and gave me that little Marshall of
[12:58] bread and no sooner than I had
[13:01] read that scripture and understood what
[13:03] was going on that the doctor walked into
[13:04] the room
[13:05] and she sat down
[13:07] and this was a real surreal moment
[13:10] she looked me in the eye and I wished at
[13:12] this point that I could be just a
[13:13] bystander watching her talk to somebody
[13:15] else about their baby
[13:16] but she looked me in the eye and was
[13:18] talking to me about my baby and said
[13:21] your baby is dying
[13:24] and we have a treatment here we can give
[13:26] her called ECMO which is a lung bypass
[13:28] machine will take and cut her jugular
[13:30] vein
[13:31] send this tube down her jugular vein
[13:33] into her heart
[13:34] to draw the blood out and circulate it
[13:36] through a machine
[13:37] and put oxygen in it because the lungs
[13:38] were not doing that
[13:39] and put it back into her jugular vein
[13:42] and thus get oxygenated blood to her
[13:44] body
[13:45] because if we don't do that soon she
[13:47] said she'll start having brain damage
[13:48] and before too long she was going to die
[13:50] her body's gonna start shutting down and
[13:51] there'll be no hope for her lungs then
[13:53] but this would give her time her lungs
[13:55] time to heal
[13:57] so she said uh and we'll leave her on
[13:59] that machine for up to two weeks and if
[14:00] she's not even better we'll take her off
[14:01] and let her go because she's not going
[14:02] to make it if she hasn't made it in two
[14:04] weeks Gabby was bawling by this time
[14:07] and I was trembling like I've never
[14:08] shaken before under that load of fear it
[14:11] was like a lion roaring in my face
[14:12] because Satan is a roaring lion Romans 2
[14:15] and fro and seeketh whom he may devour
[14:17] and that fear was just roaring at me And
[14:20] yet this little still small voice
[14:29] that little still Small Voice kept
[14:31] speaking
[14:32] kept Echo into my mind
[14:35] and
[14:37] so the doctor said uh we're gonna hold
[14:40] off a little bit because she's stable
[14:41] right now
[14:43] so we walked out of there and went to
[14:44] bed our bedside at her bedside and
[14:46] watched her for about four hours we sat
[14:47] there from 2 30 to 6 30 Sunday morning
[14:50] and
[14:51] and they still haven't done the ECMO so
[14:53] we left we told him we'll see y'all this
[14:55] afternoon we're going to church it was
[14:57] Sunday morning
[14:58] so we came here and I testified about
[15:00] that very thing that if any time you're
[15:02] in a trial at the end of the trial you
[15:04] will never look back and be glad for the
[15:05] worry and say boy I'm glad I worried I'm
[15:07] glad I feared because that's what got me
[15:09] through that's when I realized that see
[15:12] and that's what I testified about and
[15:15] then I only made one confession about
[15:16] I've I still didn't know if she was
[15:18] going to make it but I knew I had to
[15:19] overcome the fear either way so I simply
[15:21] confessed I said y'all Pray For Ava
[15:24] she's she's fine just keep praying for
[15:25] her and at that moment as far as I knew
[15:28] she might have already been dead or
[15:29] dying or already on the ECMO machine
[15:32] well we left church
[15:33] and headed back down there that day
[15:35] and called the nurse on the way down and
[15:37] I said is she on ECMO yet is she on the
[15:39] long bypass yet
[15:41] and the nurse said no she's she's
[15:43] actually getting better and from that
[15:45] hour she began to man she got better and
[15:47] better and better every day she stayed
[15:49] there all together for 30 days in the
[15:51] NICU okay getting better each day
[15:54] now here's the wonderful part about all
[15:56] this this is something that nobody knows
[15:57] but me and God I haven't even told Gabby
[16:00] this because I wanted to give God all
[16:01] the praise before all you at one time
[16:03] and if after I say this if you're not
[16:05] praising God I'm going to step outside
[16:06] and look at the rocks on the church to
[16:08] see if they're actually praising God
[16:11] okay because this is one of our shouted
[16:13] over this in the chicken truck
[16:17] there were four nurses the first four
[16:19] nurses that I've had at Eggleston
[16:23] were named Kathy Katie Kate and Caitlin
[16:26] because I mean I called called him every
[16:28] day if we weren't there to ask them okay
[16:29] that's how I remember Kathy Katie Kate
[16:31] and Caitlin pretty much different
[16:33] variations of all the same name right so
[16:35] I said hmm something significant here I
[16:37] didn't know what I texted it out
[16:38] disabled people and Brooke texted me
[16:40] back so that name means pure
[16:42] p-u-r-e and I thought hmm that's neat
[16:45] sounds pretty two days later
[16:47] it finally struck me what that means
[16:49] look up pure it means untainted it means
[16:52] free from disease free from ill
[16:54] see God he works through nurses he works
[16:57] through doctors he works through
[16:58] medicine but God is the Healer God was
[17:00] beginning to purify our baby from the
[17:02] severe lung disease beginning to draw it
[17:03] out of her because that was her
[17:04] diagnosis by this time of severe lung
[17:06] disease right he was cleansing her and
[17:08] why four because three is a witness
[17:10] three would have got our attention but
[17:12] there were four of them
[17:14] don't get ahead of me
[17:16] now
[17:18] he's already got me figured out I'm sure
[17:19] Forest God's number of Deliverance in
[17:21] the Bible the children of Israel were
[17:23] 400 years in the land of Egypt and
[17:25] bondage when they were delivered Lazarus
[17:27] was four days in the grave when Jesus
[17:29] resurrected him and delivered him from
[17:30] death and
[17:34] the children of Israel I'm sorry let's
[17:36] see the Hebrew children there you go he
[17:38] mentioned it this morning the three
[17:39] Hebrew children in the fiery furnace
[17:41] uh and the fourth man seen in that fire
[17:43] was their deliverer
[17:45] okay Forest guys number of Deliverance
[17:47] through four nurses whose name means
[17:50] pure which is a four-letter word
[17:52] God has began to purify our baby and
[17:54] cleanse her from the sickness and watch
[17:56] this
[17:57] she was born she was delivered from the
[17:59] womb if you will at four minutes till
[18:01] midnight
[18:03] and by the way a side note that was the
[18:05] best delivery best that Gabby's done so
[18:07] far everything went so smoothly I
[18:08] believe in other midwives were anointed
[18:10] but this time more than ever because
[18:11] I'll stand there praying you know I have
[18:13] to believe it and four minutes till
[18:16] midnight is when she was born she went
[18:18] into the NICU just a couple hours later
[18:20] and all day Saturday all day Sunday
[18:22] excuse me all day Thursday Friday and
[18:25] Saturday she got worse worse and worse
[18:29] and Saturday night she was at the point
[18:30] of death
[18:31] but on the fourth day
[18:33] which was Sunday the Resurrection Day
[18:35] the day we honor and celebrate the
[18:37] resurrection God began to raise her
[18:40] and heal her from that sickness
[18:45] and I'm not done
[18:47] she's our fourth child
[18:49] and you know God delivered me from Fear
[18:52] on our fourth child
[18:55] and
[18:57] she has a four-letter name I've
[18:59] her middle name is a four-letter name
[19:01] June
[19:03] now watch this
[19:06] what was the next thing I didn't write
[19:08] any of this down I just practiced it a
[19:09] lot
[19:11] four and four okay and
[19:15] uh well now I plan forgot it it'll come
[19:18] to me
[19:19] four and four all the fours in her name
[19:22] now watch
[19:24] she is her name means
[19:27] uh God is gracious did I say that at the
[19:29] start of it I don't remember God is
[19:30] gracious is what iva's name means it's a
[19:32] Hebrew name God is gracious and all
[19:35] through this trial God was gracious not
[19:36] only to deliver me but gracious to
[19:38] deliver her from the sickness God's
[19:41] grace was manifested over and over and
[19:43] over
[19:44] and um
[19:46] and those just so many other things just
[19:49] one thing after another I'm trying to
[19:51] jog my memory because there was four I
[19:53] know there was another four in there uh
[19:55] but God was gracious and let it be said
[19:57] of either from this day forward whenever
[20:00] you think of ABBA remember that God is
[20:02] gracious to to deliver God's grace is
[20:05] sufficient to deliver
[20:08] okay and um
[20:10] if I remember that other thing I'll just
[20:12] have to come back up and say it later oh
[20:14] yeah here it is oh it's a big one hang
[20:15] on this is a big one see anytime God
[20:19] gives you something The Devil Makes You
[20:20] doubt it yeah
[20:22] so immediately after this the devil's
[20:23] making me down I said okay big boy we'll
[20:25] see you come the next trial we'll find
[20:26] out right if I got delivered from fear
[20:28] or not
[20:29] the next trial came a couple weeks later
[20:31] it was last Sunday morning brother Queen
[20:32] was preaching
[20:34] Eula laid there on her back asleep
[20:37] and Gabby and the girls were in the
[20:39] bathroom and and uh the devil thought
[20:41] this is a pretty good opportunity to
[20:42] sneak in and cause some Mischief caused
[20:44] some trouble I was holding either my
[20:46] hands were tight okay and Eula was
[20:48] laying there on her back asleep and her
[20:49] arms began to flail like this
[20:52] about once every second with a heartbeat
[20:54] you know
[20:55] and she was asleep now I thought maybe
[20:58] it's just a nightmare but it'll just go
[21:00] away but no she kept doing it and then I
[21:01] noticed she's not breathing
[21:03] so I went up to raise her up she was
[21:04] just as limp as could be
[21:06] not breathing she opened her eyes and
[21:08] her eyelids okay and her eyes were
[21:10] rolled back in her head she was having a
[21:12] febrile seizure her seizure had spiked
[21:14] it was up to 103.5 and she was not
[21:16] breathing
[21:17] now I just all I did I handed off the
[21:20] baby to Terence and and took Eula picked
[21:22] her up and carried her out and said Lord
[21:24] bless my baby and no sooner than I did
[21:25] that that she coughed all that out and
[21:27] she began to breathe and it was in just
[21:30] within moments the brother Aaron and a
[21:31] whole host of other people and our two
[21:33] of our church staff nurses were out
[21:34] there assessing her people are
[21:36] surrounding us with prayer and and
[21:38] praise and it wasn't too long after that
[21:40] she came out of that and she's perfectly
[21:41] normal and well right now but here's the
[21:44] thing I didn't fear yes
[21:51] I just simply went and picked her up and
[21:53] acted I just prayed and carried her out
[21:55] and said Lord if you take my baby
[21:57] she's yours the lord giveth the Lord
[21:59] blessed us the way the lord giveth the
[22:00] lord taketh away blessed be the name of
[22:01] the Lord no worry I just walked out and

[28:01] foreign
[28:22] ER amen let's stand together we're going
[28:26] to have a baby dedication
[28:29] go ahead and bring up the the little one
[28:33] and we always do here come up with the
[28:35] parents the grandparents the great
[28:38] grandparents a whole family
[28:40] and uncles there's any ants come on with
[28:43] it
[28:44] bring the whole thing she's wanting
[28:47] she's wanting you back around
[28:56] that's this thing
[28:58] bring them in while they're getting
[29:00] everything ready okay
[29:02] bring them in bring down me
[29:08] bring a little ones to Jesus
[29:15] praying down here
[29:18] bring them in
[29:21] bring the little ones to Jesus
[29:27] bring them in
[29:31] bring them in
[29:34] bring a little ones to deep
[29:38] Jesus
[29:40] bring them in
[29:44] bring them
[29:46] and bring a little Wonder dear
[29:53] amen and amen and amen
[29:57] but it's what we do we bring the little
[29:59] ones to Jesus
[30:02] you know a lot of churches they do
[30:04] different things
[30:05] but remember in the scripture they
[30:07] brought the little children that's right
[30:11] to Jesus and he blessed them
[30:16] it's not a thing that we call it a
[30:17] baptism or anything right it's just the
[30:20] basis that we bring them to the Lord we
[30:22] hand them into the hands of the Lord
[30:25] and asked the Lord to take care of them
[30:28] that's right he's been gracious to have
[30:31] done all so far
[30:33] so whenever you finish the day
[30:35] but how do we also do
[30:38] we also do one thing the family
[30:41] standing
[30:43] see when we come to a baby dedication
[30:45] it's a little bit different I guess than
[30:47] most people and like I said it's not an
[30:50] infant doing things it's not a sin or
[30:53] saved or anything it's just we've come
[30:55] to dedicate them to the Lord give them
[30:57] into the hands of the Lord and then you
[30:59] know what
[31:00] they would take them to Jesus he'd bless
[31:02] them he'd give them right back to them
[31:04] because you know who raised the children
[31:06] Jesus didn't raise the children it was
[31:09] the people the ones around that raised
[31:11] and we always say even to the church
[31:15] that everybody in this church today is a
[31:19] people that are dedicated to one thing
[31:21] for you to live a life
[31:24] that this child
[31:27] would have an opportunity
[31:29] to be able to see Jesus Christ
[31:32] that's the point of all of it the whole
[31:35] thing is the dedicating right but the
[31:37] dedicating of the people
[31:39] that are witness to all of it that's
[31:41] right now we're to live before this
[31:43] child
[31:44] to where the child could have an
[31:46] opportunity of seeing Jesus Christ
[31:50] that's all we try to do and that's what
[31:52] we try to bring them to the to the Lord
[31:55] amen
[32:15] if I see you then
[32:24] we bring you out
[32:30] landed router I want her again
[32:34] it's not me standing here it is
[32:42] if you hear you would take the child and
[32:44] you'd hold it up
[32:46] books
[32:57] we thank you Father that we have this
[32:59] opportunity to be a part of this
[33:02] be a part of seeing the family standing
[33:04] here that they realize that a miracle
[33:08] is transpired yes and all of their lives
[33:11] amen that they can see that you brought
[33:14] a baby
[33:16] where the even the doctor said couldn't
[33:18] live I guess you've gone into Texas but
[33:22] now it's
[33:24] in your hand
[33:26] we just commit to our opportunity
[33:28] anymore

[33:34] the town Lord we give her back
[33:38] yes we love you and we thank you
[33:46] a little bundle of joy that's right

[33:55] ones each ones had their opportunity to
[33:59] be dedicated amen
