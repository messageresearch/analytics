[22:51] John 1 1. we had a good time this past
[22:54] weekend preaching that brother would be
[22:57] his old church with brother Andre head
[22:59] and we brought a little thought we're
[23:01] going to kind of weave it in a little
[23:02] bit tonight
[23:03] and we're going to keep the same title
[23:06] Son of Man part 120 but we're going to
[23:09] talk a little bit about
[23:11] the anointing there's an anointing uh if
[23:14] you haven't caught it yet sometimes we
[23:16] we go through things and and we get
[23:19] almost to the end of the series like we
[23:20] are now and then the Lord will just say
[23:23] hey that's a did you tell him that was
[23:25] an anointing so because it is an
[23:28] anointing all these all these are
[23:32] anointings they are the faith virtue in
[23:34] all those temples patients but now
[23:35] remember your birth is not an anointing
[23:39] your new birth is not an anointing right
[23:41] all right everybody with me but all the
[23:44] other things that pile on top of that
[23:46] that's an anointing that comes on us and
[23:49] if we're not careful we'll get that
[23:51] anointing on our spirit and not let it
[23:53] go into our soul
[23:54] that's what we're working on with the
[23:56] Statue of perfect man all right so we'll
[23:58] get into that a little bit this
[23:59] afternoon so
[24:01] let's bow our heads Lord thank you for
[24:03] this middle of the week
[24:06] Lord many are tired and weary and we
[24:08] pray Lord that you give them
[24:09] Supernatural strength father I pray this
[24:11] should be with us Lord in the
[24:12] furthermore this service you be the
[24:14] active participant the one that takes
[24:15] over and does the speaking father
[24:17] Lord I pray it should be with the ones
[24:19] that are sick Lord sister Freda had went
[24:21] yesterday for those tests Lord and she
[24:23] was coughing up some blood Lord we
[24:25] hadn't heard anything else but Lord we
[24:27] we know you're the great physician and
[24:28] you're the one that will take care of
[24:30] her Lord
[24:30] we pray Lord that you'll take care of
[24:32] the ones Lord that are gone on vacation
[24:34] and different things and especially the
[24:37] ones that are heading to school
[24:39] Schools starting here in just a few
[24:41] weeks few days for some Lord I pray that
[24:43] you'd be with them and Lord cover them
[24:46] the whole time Lord that they're that
[24:48] they're there Lord and may they may they
[24:50] truly learn they have to learn their
[24:53] book knowledge and their knowledge of of
[24:55] how to navigate in this world but Lord
[24:57] may it be smoothed over with some
[25:00] spiritual knowledge and may that
[25:02] spiritual knowledge take over lord and
[25:04] when the natural knowledge leaves let
[25:06] the spiritual knowledge take over lord I
[25:09] pray that you do that tonight father
[25:10] anoint the speaker anoint the hearer
[25:13] father bless us and be with us the
[25:16] further in this service in Jesus name we
[25:18] pray
[25:19] amen also remember the missionaries will
[25:22] be coming in can't meeting missionaries
[25:23] will be coming so they'll be coming from
[25:25] all over the world and probably in
[25:28] September I mean August that's why I
[25:30] kind of left it open last three weekends
[25:32] and in August I'm sure we'll have a a
[25:36] foreign visitor somewhere in that time
[25:40] so we appreciate them coming in and uh
[25:43] also uh just for FYI in October brother
[25:47] Vernon manahan is going to be here from
[25:49] the Philippines
[25:50] he's the one that we send the money to
[25:52] so he comes I don't think he came last
[25:55] year but he come the year before or
[25:56] maybe because of covid they didn't get
[25:57] to come for a couple years he always
[25:59] tries to send us a an update on the
[26:02] money I mean he takes care of every
[26:04] penny every penny we send him he puts it
[26:07] somewhere and he writes it down he's a
[26:09] good accountant and he writes it all
[26:11] down and and then he will give you a a
[26:15] report that that money you send that we
[26:18] send from the church
[26:19] we give some to the brother Danny
[26:22] Senator brother Nester and different
[26:23] ones and it pays for their plane tickets
[26:25] or plays for the pays for their boat
[26:27] ticket or pays for something to take
[26:29] them out into the highways and byways
[26:34] um brother Dale many years ago used to
[26:36] send money for buildings and churches
[26:37] and stuff like that we don't do that
[26:40] anymore it's best to give it to a person
[26:42] and let a person take it and go and
[26:45] preach the gospel they let them build
[26:47] their own stuff uh their own building
[26:49] they'll love it more if they build their
[26:51] own I know we do help some and we have
[26:53] helped some some of the newer ones but
[26:55] some of the older ones that we help now
[26:57] it's mainly from Ministry to go out and
[26:59] books and tapes or or take them take the
[27:02] gospel to uh back in somewhere in the
[27:05] Philippines that something nobody would
[27:06] want it I wouldn't want to go
[27:08] and they will go all right is that like
[27:10] bro land land different ones we give him
[27:12] some money to buy a van and he's using
[27:15] it he sent me a picture the other day he
[27:17] used it so much he run the wheel off of
[27:19] it or run the tire off of the wheel so
[27:21] uh he had to buy him a new on you tire
[27:24] but uh we did help him buy the van so
[27:27] let's let's just uh we love the Lord I
[27:30] want you to know where your money's
[27:31] going I really do I want you to know
[27:32] that it's not just you're not just
[27:33] putting it in a plate and it's just
[27:35] going out Into Thin Air it is being used
[27:38] for the gospel always has and always
[27:40] will be all right so don't don't feel
[27:44] um that your money's being
[27:46] you know wasted it's being used all
[27:49] around the world you'll never know you
[27:51] will know in the Millennium you will
[27:52] know maybe in the future home how much
[27:54] as as brother Andre in different ones go
[27:58] over Seasons some lady says I got a I uh
[28:02] some of you that weren't there Bill
[28:03] Andre was telling a story that he was it
[28:05] where was he
[28:07] where was he
[28:09] Guyana
[28:10] Guyana
[28:11] he's in Guyana on a mission trip
[28:14] and some sister walked up to him and
[28:16] said do you know this brother in other
[28:18] words his brother Dale
[28:20] huh
[28:21] she had one tight she'd got a hold of a
[28:24] tape and it was brother Dale and it
[28:26] helped her so much so you never know
[28:29] you know yeah we may we may not be
[28:31] always preaching to the to the crowd
[28:33] maybe preaching the ones overseas so you
[28:36] never know but we appreciate brother Joe
[28:38] and the different ones for putting this
[28:40] thing out and getting it out to the
[28:42] people we sure appreciate all of you
[28:43] that has anything to do with that so
[28:45] let's read in the beginning was the word
[28:46] words with God and the Word was God and
[28:49] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[28:50] us and we beheld his glory the glory is
[28:53] the only begotten of the father
[28:55] full of grace and truth you can sit down
[28:58] I know maybe have you stand up too long
[29:01] but keeps you from sleeping Philippians
[29:04] 2 verse 3 says let nothing be done
[29:06] through Strife or vainglory see we've
[29:08] come here to brotherly kindness and I
[29:10] was thinking just the other day how that
[29:13] brotherly kindness can be the most
[29:15] calming thing you ever that you ever
[29:18] experience or it can be the most
[29:20] traumatic thing you've ever experienced
[29:21] everybody with me on that it can be you
[29:24] you can rub elbows and and and and and
[29:27] be all right or rub elbows and as
[29:30] brother dick always said my spirit May
[29:33] irritate your demons so
[29:35] Philippians 2 verse 3 said let nothing
[29:38] be done through Strife for vainglory but
[29:40] in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem
[29:42] other better than themselves and I think
[29:45] that's what we should do as a church and
[29:48] we do that
[29:49] um and I'll read something where brother
[29:51] Brown tell he said it's not in other
[29:53] words it's not hard to have brotherly
[29:55] kindness as an individual
[29:57] but as a group it's hard to hold
[30:00] I'm a region I'll tell you why why we
[30:03] said that because as an individual you
[30:05] can have somebody who just like brother
[30:07] Andre we were talking about and we gave
[30:09] him those accolades this weekend brother
[30:11] Andre is one of the meekest men that I
[30:13] know he just never raises his voice he
[30:15] got a little excited Sunday afternoon
[30:17] after the service was over but he's
[30:20] really just even kill nothing really you
[30:23] know upsets him and he's he's just even
[30:25] killed with the people and and they're
[30:27] comfortable with him and I'm comfortable
[30:29] with him and and I just appreciate a
[30:31] brother that can do that he can stand in
[30:33] the middle and grab both hands and put
[30:35] them together where some of us some of
[30:37] us may not be able to do that all right
[30:40] but we're working on it he's still
[30:42] working on me First Corinthians 2 verse
[30:44] 12. now we're going to get up to the
[30:46] Holy Spirit and we're going to talk
[30:48] about it maybe a little bit
[30:50] at the end of the service but I want to
[30:53] cover something here just a second First
[30:54] Corinthians 2 verse 12. now we have
[30:57] received not the spirit of the world
[30:59] but the spirit which is of god so we
[31:01] have the spirit of the world right
[31:03] all right uh we had our conversation in
[31:06] times past in the lust of the Flesh and
[31:07] all the pride of life and all those
[31:09] different things that Paul Paul tells us
[31:11] about all right I saw something the
[31:13] other day
[31:14] it was a statement that said I wonder
[31:16] what Paul thought
[31:19] when he stepped over on the other side
[31:21] and saw the ones that he had persecuted
[31:24] and killed there
[31:26] had killed he didn't kill him he had him
[31:28] killed right because they were
[31:30] Christians he was having Christians
[31:32] persecuted and they were being killed
[31:34] and now they're in the sixth Dimension
[31:36] wherever Paul's group is and then Paul
[31:38] walks over there and after he dies and
[31:40] they're like oh hi
[31:42] no that was a joyous
[31:45] meeting because those people you know
[31:48] what I believe they're really truly
[31:49] didn't blame Paul
[31:51] as a true Christian you don't blame
[31:53] another person I had a person tell me
[31:55] one time said you've caused me to lose
[31:57] all my friends you never had them to
[31:59] start with
[32:00] an outside person cannot cause you to
[32:03] lose friends
[32:04] you only cause you to lose friends right
[32:07] all right it's not what somebody else
[32:09] does to lose a real friend
[32:11] our real brother
[32:13] like I said before as you know you and
[32:15] I'll read it where brother Brown talks
[32:16] about in individuals it's not it can be
[32:19] held but in a group it's the whole issue
[32:22] that we have to as a group as a body
[32:25] we've got to all come to brotherly
[32:27] kindness all right if we can't love them
[32:30] here we sure know how we're going to get
[32:31] them over there
[32:33] now we have received not the spirit of
[32:35] the world but the spirit which is of god
[32:37] that we might know the things that are
[32:39] freely given to us of God so when we get
[32:41] the spirit the spirit of adoption or
[32:44] Spirit of of Truth or Spirit of the new
[32:46] birth then
[32:48] it puts us in line to understand these
[32:52] things as I was telling them Sunday now
[32:53] you can you can you can read the quote
[32:55] where brother Brown says you know God
[32:57] give you the Holy Ghost and he give you
[32:59] everything for your journey well
[33:02] that's true but he also gave you ten
[33:04] fingers ten toes sorry Thomas ten
[33:07] fingers ten toes two eyes he gave you
[33:10] all that equipment now what you do with
[33:11] it is your business all right so he gave
[33:15] you the Holy Ghost now once you do it
[33:16] with it is your business all right
[33:19] which things also we speak not in The
[33:22] Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[33:24] which the Holy Ghost teacheth now that
[33:26] now your Holy Ghost is a teacher we know
[33:28] that tutors Governors till we come to
[33:31] what but see it that's talking about
[33:33] coming to adoption that's bringing us to
[33:35] full stature which is that thing right
[33:37] there see this down here is a birth
[33:39] everybody with me this is a birth this
[33:42] is an anointing
[33:44] you don't get born twice
[33:50] but it says being born again but you
[33:52] understand it's not like the
[33:53] justification against baptized in the
[33:55] Holy Ghost you weren't born again I mean
[33:57] you weren't Eternal now you are
[33:59] you can't get Eternal again
[34:01] you're already Eternal you just add two
[34:04] so that's what we're talking about
[34:06] tonight we're going to add to this as we
[34:08] go up the statue of perfect man we're
[34:10] going to add to these things but it's
[34:13] which the Holy Spirit teacheth look
[34:15] comparing spiritual things with
[34:17] spiritual We Are Spiritual people
[34:19] brother Adam told us he said we're
[34:20] eaglets we're little Messiahs We Are
[34:23] Spiritual people we're supposed to be I
[34:25] know we live in a natural lot but we're
[34:27] supposed to be to where we can discern
[34:29] or have a little bit of spirituality
[34:30] about us especially when it comes to the
[34:32] word of God and if somebody's teaching
[34:35] or preaching something an error it
[34:37] should be something that that LOL you
[34:39] know a little bell should go off
[34:41] somewhere all right everybody with me
[34:44] Peter besides this so besides your new
[34:47] birth besides getting back down into
[34:50] your soul
[34:51] everybody with me here and besides this
[34:54] besides this divine nature going into
[34:56] your soul giving all diligence add
[35:00] so you're adding or you're anointing
[35:03] because you can have many thousands of
[35:05] anointings remember last Sunday the
[35:08] devil was anointed he was anointed
[35:10] Sheriff he was the first anointed one
[35:12] right
[35:13] right he was anointed to do his job
[35:16] all right and then till iniquity was
[35:18] found in him and when iniquity was found
[35:19] in him then he became the devil but he
[35:23] was Lucifer when he began all right and
[35:25] God created him he said I created you
[35:27] perfect until iniquity was found in you
[35:30] but we as Christians we add we add these
[35:35] anointings because Paul had an anointing
[35:37] he was the first church age messenger he
[35:39] had an anointing brother Brown as many
[35:40] times I told you before they had a box
[35:43] that they were that they they stayed in
[35:45] they were confined to that box Moses
[35:48] couldn't get into Noah's message Noah
[35:49] couldn't get into Moses message all
[35:51] right Paul couldn't get into irenius's
[35:54] message and ireneus couldn't get into
[35:56] Martin's message so you understand what
[35:57] I mean they had a certain message they
[35:59] had to bring or a certain anointing
[36:02] right that's what we preached on Sunday
[36:04] anointed for a purpose
[36:06] all right there's an anointing comes
[36:08] this a purpose it has a God doesn't just
[36:10] listen he even anoints anointed ones for
[36:13] a purpose
[36:17] to almost deceive the very last that's
[36:19] because that's what the Bible says
[36:21] all right
[36:23] so the knowledge Temperance Temperance
[36:25] patience we're going to add these
[36:26] virtues or add these anointings and to
[36:29] Godliness brotherly kindness and the
[36:31] brotherly kindness charity and we'll get
[36:33] to that in just a little bit but we were
[36:34] talking about this weekend I want to
[36:36] show you something real quick I know
[36:37] y'all we've been through Genesis 1 26
[36:39] but remember it says let us make man in
[36:42] our image after our likeness so that's
[36:44] not an anointing
[36:46] that's a person
[36:48] that's an extension of God
[36:51] everybody with me amen that wasn't all
[36:53] mankind
[36:55] that's just the bride that's not the 144
[36:58] thousand that's not the fifth seal Jew
[37:02] that's not anybody in the Old Testament
[37:07] everybody with me
[37:09] that was an extension of God that's
[37:11] God's attribute
[37:14] his own children his own children are
[37:18] only the ones that's going to be birthed
[37:20] by New Birth into the kingdom of God all
[37:25] right everybody with me but there are
[37:27] anointings you can be anointed uh
[37:30] brother I'm even says Eve was anointed
[37:33] but who anointed her God didn't anoint
[37:35] her the devil did all right Cain was
[37:38] anointed to kill Abel
[37:42] let us make man in our image and after
[37:44] our likeness and let them have dominion
[37:46] we see that there's something about this
[37:48] group of people
[37:49] that's special God set aside this group
[37:52] of people and he wanted this image he
[37:55] said created man his own image and image
[37:57] of God created him male and female so we
[37:59] know there are male and female created
[38:01] he them that makes the brothers and
[38:03] sisters that's why we're we call each
[38:05] other brother and sister because that
[38:06] like I said that denotes the family all
[38:08] right I have a natural brother and a
[38:10] natural sister I don't have to call them
[38:12] brother or sister but I do you because
[38:13] you're not part of my natural family
[38:15] you're part of my spiritual family all
[38:17] right if I get too fast just tell me
[38:19] because I got something I need to get to
[38:21] real quick so God created man in his own
[38:23] image the image of God created in him
[38:25] now look whatever that image is it's of
[38:28] God
[38:30] that image was not the devil that image
[38:33] was not an angel
[38:37] that image is you every son and daughter
[38:40] of God since the day of Pentecost
[38:43] 80 30.
[38:47] what's created in God's image are formed
[38:50] in God's image now remember this part of
[38:53] God was not created like Lucifer was
[38:57] Lucifer was literally created he was
[39:00] nothing then here's Lucifer God created
[39:02] Lucifer and said you be the anointed
[39:04] cherub you be the one that goes up and
[39:06] down and and you be my song leader and
[39:08] you go from Heaven he still goes from
[39:10] Heaven to Hell and back and forth and up
[39:12] to heaven amen
[39:13] he walks among all that God's give him
[39:16] that Liberty to walk anywhere he wants
[39:18] to
[39:19] but when you're born again
[39:21] not walk in your soul
[39:24] praise God that's that's why that's what
[39:27] I want you to see it's like I was saying
[39:29] you God Is So encapsulated inside of you
[39:32] he can't even get out
[39:34] you gotta let him out
[39:37] somebody ought to let it out oh somebody
[39:39] ought to put that on a t-shirt so God
[39:41] created man in his own image and the
[39:42] image of God created to him male and
[39:44] female created them so that's the birth
[39:46] not the anointing
[39:49] are not the adoption
[39:52] some of this group of people right here
[39:55] will not come to adoption
[39:58] lots of them will not a lot of these
[40:00] people that God created in his own image
[40:02] were working as we were talking about
[40:05] Sunday you look in the Book of Luke and
[40:07] you see that that there was a book
[40:09] handed Jesus and it was closed
[40:14] Jesus sat down and opened the book
[40:17] so Jesus Christ is the only one who can
[40:18] open the book close the book
[40:21] amen all right so he was handed a close
[40:23] book he re opened it up read out of it
[40:25] identified who he was have you ever
[40:28] tried that
[40:30] when you come to church every Sunday you
[40:32] should open your book
[40:35] and identify who you are and then you
[40:37] can say as we said Sunday and as brother
[40:39] random said during his tenure and Jesus
[40:42] during his this day
[40:44] this scripture is fulfilled
[40:47] in your ears this day all right and it's
[40:49] not a 24-hour day it's the day of the
[40:51] Lord
[40:52] it's the day for us to come to adoption
[40:54] it's today for us to come to the change
[40:55] of the body it's for us to come to the
[40:58] son of man Ministry that when God when
[41:00] Jesus was sitting there who was he he
[41:02] was the son of man
[41:04] so he when he closed that book and
[41:06] handed it back to the priest they just
[41:08] didn't realize in symbol form but that's
[41:10] when God shut the book
[41:14] no one understood him no one was born
[41:17] again at the time
[41:19] and then even on the day of Pentecost he
[41:22] only led a certain peace or portion of
[41:24] itself out the book was still closed
[41:28] right it's been closed until Revelation
[41:30] 10 7 when that Mighty angel came down
[41:32] that Mighty Angel brought a scroll
[41:37] you want us if you want to say it's the
[41:39] same scroll he had in the temple that's
[41:41] okay with me I don't care but he opened
[41:43] the book
[41:44] and he opened a book and he handed it to
[41:46] the seventh angel messenger in that
[41:47] seventh angel messenger handed it ducks
[41:50] making us the final voice to the final
[41:52] age that you and I or have come to a
[41:55] birth but we've also come to anoint him
[41:58] the anointing that we have in the end
[41:59] time is to come to the son of man
[42:01] Ministry the open book the son of man
[42:04] was sitting there in the temple with the
[42:06] book open
[42:09] everybody
[42:11] all them denominations that were sitting
[42:13] in that Temple the Bible said they
[42:15] fasted their eyes on him there was an
[42:16] anointing there brother Brown said it
[42:18] was the greatest anointing that was ever
[42:19] on a person
[42:20] he opened a book
[42:22] read where he was at brother George he
[42:25] closed the book back handed it back to
[42:27] the priest and they said precious words
[42:30] proceeded out of his mouth brother Brown
[42:32] said and I'll read it because I'll
[42:33] probably do that series maybe a little
[42:35] bit on anointing but brother Brown said
[42:38] you would think that with that power or
[42:40] that great of an anointing that people
[42:42] would be shouting speaking in tongues
[42:43] running all over the building
[42:45] he said he sat down in Precious words
[42:48] proceeded out of his mouth you know what
[42:50] he said anointing was is supreme power
[42:53] in control all right and without these
[42:56] virtues
[42:58] remember he was The Virtue setting there
[43:01] he was it
[43:03] he was sitting there with the virtues in
[43:05] him he was The Headstone had the whole
[43:07] cap he was everything
[43:09] he was the fullness of the godhead
[43:11] bodily you and I are part of that but he
[43:13] was the fullness and he was walking God
[43:15] on two feet but I remember he had to
[43:18] have an anointing
[43:20] because even there in Luke he said he he
[43:22] has anointed me to preach
[43:26] on the River Jordan when that Dove came
[43:29] down and he said this is my beloved Son
[43:31] in whom I'm pleased to dwell that's what
[43:32] he said to you at the new birth Jesus
[43:34] didn't need a new birth
[43:38] but he needed that anointing because for
[43:40] 29 and a half years they call it the
[43:42] silent years he never said a word that
[43:44] we needed except when he was 13 he kind
[43:47] of jumped on the scene and and and said
[43:49] something and then back off for you know
[43:51] 10 more years 15 more years nothing
[43:55] why that anointing that time of
[43:57] anointing John the Baptist had to grow
[44:00] up John the Baptist had to come to
[44:01] fruition John the Baptist had to come to
[44:03] his message which was very short
[44:06] amen but he had to come to that message
[44:07] because he was the one to introduce the
[44:10] head which is who Christ right
[44:14] but this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[44:16] pleased to dwell
[44:17] then he had an anointing on the River
[44:19] Jordan that anointing was for his
[44:21] ministry to preach for three and a half
[44:23] years and to preach the the hardest
[44:27] three and a half years of his life he
[44:28] probably wasn't uh from 29 and a half
[44:31] down he probably you know he he was
[44:34] probably quiet didn't have a lot of
[44:35] family or friends or something but he
[44:36] had a bunch of brothers and sisters the
[44:38] Bible tells us and his daddy died or is
[44:41] his chosen Daddy on Earth had passed
[44:44] away early Joseph so he didn't have a
[44:46] real daddy so he was just kind of I mean
[44:48] I don't think he's wandering around all
[44:49] over the place and doing like we did
[44:51] going to shows and drinking and smoking
[44:53] and gambling and all that stuff and I
[44:55] didn't do that because he was the Holy
[44:57] Ghost he didn't need the Holy Ghost
[44:59] he had that already that control was
[45:01] already in him
[45:03] he was a proper child as they talk about
[45:05] Moses
[45:06] but at 13 He said it must be about my
[45:09] father's business he knew what his
[45:10] position was coming to he just didn't
[45:12] know exactly what he was but when he got
[45:14] on that River Jordan and that anointing
[45:16] didn't just fall on him and then leave
[45:19] it fell on him and went in him
[45:23] you know what we were talking about
[45:25] Sunday for those of you that weren't
[45:26] there the word anointing actually means
[45:29] to smear
[45:31] like peanut butter on a sandwich
[45:34] are are poor
[45:37] and now what happened in the Old
[45:39] Testament as a type they couldn't get
[45:41] the oil of the Holy Ghost Inside of of
[45:43] Aaron
[45:45] so they poured oil over him and smeared
[45:47] it all over him all the way down to the
[45:49] Hem of His of His Garment right
[45:52] so that's what the word anointing means
[45:54] actually means to smear
[45:56] smear me
[45:58] smear smear this virgin smear knowledge
[46:02] Temperance patience just smeared all
[46:04] over me
[46:06] so that's what anointing means so we
[46:08] have the birth and then we have the
[46:10] anointing now we're going to talk to
[46:12] that that anointing is going to come to
[46:14] a a part that we've got to come to and
[46:17] brother random in 1960 said now what is
[46:19] adoption let me get to this I don't know
[46:21] whether uh there's a lot of people in
[46:24] the message that just don't preach on
[46:26] adoption
[46:27] but it's important that we come to that
[46:30] position because brother Ryan says look
[46:33] your adoption is not your birth
[46:36] it's your placing amen
[46:38] we have wandered first I'm sorry we have
[46:41] wandered for 60 years what the prophet
[46:44] of God said wandering through the
[46:46] Wilderness wondering what he said
[46:49] wondering why he said these things
[46:51] wonder why he said well you these
[46:53] virtues are are required
[46:57] it's required for your adoption
[46:59] it's required for your placing
[47:02] and placing is where we want to be the
[47:05] problem was they got misplaced in the
[47:09] new world or in Canaan they got
[47:12] misplaced
[47:13] this one married this one this one this
[47:15] one they married the Canaanites they
[47:17] married the amorites they mingled and
[47:19] mingled and mingled well that's what the
[47:20] devil wanted to do and that's what he's
[47:22] done with us he took us he brought the
[47:23] pure word of God to William Aaron
[47:25] Branham he come to adoption he came to
[47:27] hear ye him
[47:29] in 1963 somewhere in there the book open
[47:33] and he started preaching the seals
[47:36] and he preached the greatest messages
[47:40] he'd ever preached before
[47:42] the most annoying
[47:44] [Music]
[47:46] annoyed to see it the week of that of
[47:48] the seals
[47:50] everybody with me
[47:53] brother George Smith
[47:56] was there uh Friday and uh
[48:01] George's George
[48:03] but I like him I don't mind I like being
[48:05] around if you look in those pictures
[48:06] Joe's got I'm with him 90 of the time
[48:09] because we're talking about things but
[48:11] he he was he's got a new seal book and
[48:14] it's got a few things that's not changed
[48:16] but
[48:18] um
[48:18] brother Brown would say four like before
[48:22] well they changed it to before because
[48:23] if you translate it you can't translate
[48:25] four
[48:26] f o r e not f-o-u-r so you can't
[48:29] translate that so he kind of you know
[48:30] put added or massaged it a little bit he
[48:32] said but anyway he asked me he said by
[48:34] the way he said what is the most
[48:36] important part of that seal book
[48:39] what is the most important
[48:41] of either message or most important
[48:44] quote in that wholesale book
[48:47] I said bro George you won't believe it
[48:50] I said the greatest quote in that
[48:52] wholesale book that I can identify with
[48:54] is on the questions and answers on the
[48:57] sales when brother Brown said it's not
[48:59] for you
[49:04] so that took you that took that
[49:07] anointing it could not follow no one in
[49:09] that building
[49:10] he said it's not for you you're not
[49:12] supposed to get it
[49:17] so who's it for me I can identify with
[49:21] that I can understand the fifth seal
[49:23] whether it's you know it's the Jews
[49:25] under the altar crying how long I can
[49:28] see the seventh seal I can see the the
[49:30] white horse rider and all those things
[49:32] but and that identifies sure in my
[49:35] journey but that was brother Brown I'm
[49:37] standing there he was prophesying he
[49:40] said you're not supposed to get it right
[49:43] that's right but right around the coming
[49:45] of the Lord there'll be a group of
[49:46] people in other words paraphrasing
[49:47] that's going to get it so that's the
[49:49] greatest quote in the book for me
[49:51] it turned that whole anointing to where
[49:53] there's no there's no question to
[49:57] anybody sitting in that room in 1963
[50:00] that said I got it
[50:03] no you didn't you might have got your
[50:06] portion because remember brother around
[50:07] he kind of backed up he said just go on
[50:09] and live a good Christian simple
[50:11] Christian Life right
[50:13] he said don't try to twist if you get
[50:15] all messed up you'll twist yourself away
[50:16] from it why it wasn't time the anointing
[50:19] was not there yet the anointing had to
[50:21] be on a bride that could come to
[50:23] adoption
[50:25] that could come to a body change and
[50:27] it's a son of man Ministry would take
[50:29] over and would preach the same three and
[50:32] a half year message that the Lord Jesus
[50:34] did two thousand years ago you said
[50:37] there's no way you can do that well
[50:39] watch
[50:41] that's what me and brother Andre was
[50:43] talking about you just watch people say
[50:44] well we can't get it right all the time
[50:46] we ain't perfect Jesus Christ never had
[50:50] a problem with his Doctrine and it was
[50:53] perfect
[50:55] now he might have talked as a human he
[50:57] might have said that old Fox he might
[50:58] have said let's go on vacation let's go
[51:00] do this let's go do that he was a human
[51:02] being but when he said I only speak that
[51:04] which the father tells me that was God
[51:07] Almighty talking to us
[51:09] and he can't get it wrong
[51:11] because it was the word that we depend
[51:14] on
[51:16] dependence on salvation
[51:19] I know he died for me I put my
[51:21] dependence on that every word he spoke I
[51:24] can receive in my heart and if I let him
[51:27] out and do his work he'll make me as
[51:29] perfect as he is that's why he said be
[51:32] ye therefore perfect even as your father
[51:35] in Heaven is perfect
[51:37] so your adoption is your placing right
[51:40] all right so we want to be placed I want
[51:42] to know my position you should want to
[51:44] know your position well I don't know I
[51:46] just come Church well coming to church
[51:49] may be a position for some of y'all
[51:54] really
[51:55] you know what brother Brown said
[51:57] adoption was
[51:58] a little wash woman going about her
[52:01] daily duty but she knew her place
[52:04] amen the man with the lunch box of
[52:06] course we don't carry those anymore but
[52:07] used to Thomas does
[52:11] oh you carry lunchbox too
[52:19] Mickey Mouse
[52:22] don't look Batman
[52:28] let's stand
[52:32] we're going to pray for Louise I'll
[52:34] bless y'all if you got thermos in it
[52:39] but anyway Thomas does care but that's a
[52:40] lunch box if he's doing his job
[52:43] under the word of God under the
[52:45] anointing of the hour that he's in he's
[52:47] just as powerful come on he's just as
[52:50] powerful as a messenger standing behind
[52:52] here
[52:54] if he'll stay in his position the
[52:56] problem is we have it all stayed in our
[52:58] position
[53:00] right everybody with me on that
[53:05] when we were born again John 1 17 I
[53:07] believe when we were born of the spirit
[53:09] of God we are the sons of God now that
[53:12] was also in Romans that we received the
[53:14] spirit of adoption when you're born
[53:16] again you receive the spirit of adoption
[53:18] not adoption the spirit where in other
[53:20] words you come into that Open Door you
[53:22] come into that place where you can be
[53:24] adopted listen you got to be in the
[53:27] family before you can be adopted all
[53:29] right so you got to be a son and
[53:30] daughter of God then you come to your
[53:33] place and then you listen for 10 years
[53:35] 15 years 30 years 40 years 50 years and
[53:37] God somewhere along the way something
[53:40] clicks and you say that's where I'm
[53:42] supposed to be
[53:46] but we were predestinated
[53:49] here's what I'm trying to get to you for
[53:51] the sons of the last day that's us
[53:53] we were predestinated unto adoption
[53:58] the Masterpiece brother round talks
[54:00] about we know that
[54:02] that the marring of the Masterpiece
[54:05] there was a masterpiece family in the
[54:06] Garden of Eden how beautiful until what
[54:09] Satan did during the rest period during
[54:12] you know God was resting and trusting in
[54:15] his Masterpiece his enemy came in found
[54:16] the Great Masterpiece and he crawled
[54:19] under the garden walls and he marred
[54:20] this beautiful Masterpiece he martyred
[54:22] it but now remember he goes on and tells
[54:25] us and that's why I want to talk about
[54:26] anointing you look and see that
[54:28] that The Mooring of the of the statue
[54:32] made the Statue
[54:37] the masterpiece
[54:40] there could have been many many many
[54:42] many many many statues of Moses
[54:45] but the one that Michelangelo looked at
[54:49] and the one he got so inspired or
[54:52] anointed
[54:53] till he hit it on the knee with his
[54:55] hammer and said speak to me in other
[54:58] words you're so alive till you're you're
[55:00] exactly what the image was and we've
[55:03] always said that too that's what we've
[55:05] been waiting on the Genesis 1 26 man
[55:08] come to that full image that God saw
[55:10] before the foundation in the world goes
[55:12] George
[55:14] and you know what he'd done he smote Us
[55:16] by putting us in human flesh
[55:22] but
[55:26] it's what makes us a masterpiece
[55:30] the marring is what made him a redeemer
[55:34] the marring is what made him a Healer
[55:37] the Maori is what made him all the other
[55:39] compound names of Jehovah and all the
[55:41] different things that you call the
[55:43] Prince of Peace the rose of Sharon the
[55:45] lily of the valley
[55:47] Adam listen to me Adam didn't know those
[55:50] titles
[55:53] he knew him his father he knew him as
[55:55] Creator but he didn't know him sure
[55:57] later on he knew him as a savior but he
[55:59] didn't know him like me and you know him
[56:00] as a savior
[56:01] anybody with me because what it wasn't
[56:04] the time
[56:05] it got marred so he had to take that
[56:07] Genesis 1 26 man put it back not so much
[56:10] on the Shelf but put it in his bosom put
[56:13] it in his breast
[56:14] put it in his heart
[56:16] and hold on to those names in the book
[56:20] mine yours Paul Peter James John
[56:26] that's right now listen there's
[56:27] different sections Moses and all those
[56:29] different ones they're in that section
[56:30] but they're not in that section
[56:33] they're not in the Genesis 1 26 section
[56:37] sure they'll be given eternal life but
[56:38] you're going to see in just a minute we
[56:40] already talked about it Moses and all
[56:42] these different ones they were anointed
[56:43] something would come on them so strong
[56:45] till they would prophesy or they would
[56:48] call fleas and flies and frogs David
[56:50] could write all these Psalms and just be
[56:52] so anointed to where God said oh he's a
[56:55] man after my own heart
[56:57] but they were not anointing would leave
[56:59] him he'd be a murderer
[57:03] Moses murderer
[57:10] because power without character look at
[57:11] Samson
[57:12] Samson was so anointed his anointing was
[57:16] to slay the Philistines God cursed them
[57:19] the amount of listings are he cursed him
[57:22] and he put Samson on the Earth
[57:24] to take care of the Philistines and
[57:26] what'd he do he fell by them
[57:28] why because he had an anointing that
[57:30] would come on him he could lift the
[57:31] gates of the city up pick this building
[57:33] up and set it over two feet and he
[57:35] wasn't much bigger than Jonas
[57:38] all right right but it was power without
[57:42] character
[57:43] David Sampson even Abraham Jacob Noah
[57:46] Saul Elisha all these different ones
[57:49] and we were talking this weekend about
[57:51] David and the anointing on David was was
[57:55] to be a king
[57:56] all right now I think that I thought the
[57:59] anointing according to Revelations 5 was
[58:01] for me and you to be Kings and Priests
[58:04] all right so let's start acting like it
[58:05] let's start taking the full benefit of
[58:07] that
[58:08] 1965.
[58:11] doing God of service now notice in this
[58:14] now David
[58:15] thought he had everything in order now
[58:16] what he's doing is now he's he said he's
[58:19] trying to do God a service without it
[58:20] being his will what did David do David
[58:23] was anointed in his own self
[58:27] come on
[58:29] he knew the law
[58:32] he knew that thing had to be carried by
[58:34] priests
[58:35] remember when the art was coming back in
[58:38] he put it on a cart
[58:40] and it almost fell over and a man
[58:42] reached and just tried trying to do
[58:44] trying to do right
[58:47] he reached him grabbed it when he did
[58:49] God struck him dead because he can't go
[58:51] against his own law he can't go against
[58:53] his own word so but that one was on
[58:55] David
[58:58] now notice David thought he had
[59:00] everything in order and he was inspired
[59:04] see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man
[59:07] but it's got to be in the order of the
[59:11] anointing
[59:13] Moses couldn't come with Noah's message
[59:14] we can't come well listen
[59:17] Luther's message put thousands hundreds
[59:20] of thousands in the bride methodists
[59:25] John Wesley hundreds of thousands
[59:28] millions Dwight Moody brother Brown said
[59:30] hunt Millions I guess he said
[59:34] but they were trinitarians
[59:36] they were working under a closed book
[59:38] they can only see through a glass Darkly
[59:39] they could only see the part that God
[59:42] wanted them to do because you can take
[59:43] Luther's anointing today and just be
[59:46] justified and die and go to hell
[59:50] right
[59:52] but it's got to be in the order of the
[59:54] anointing the outside Spirit can be
[59:56] anointed look with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:00] now listen Moses wasn't anointed by the
[1:00:04] devil to create flies fleas and frogs
[1:00:06] that was God because God's only Creator
[1:00:09] Satan can't create Satan can imitate and
[1:00:12] impersonate but he can't create
[1:00:14] all right the outside Spirit can be
[1:00:16] Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the
[1:00:18] Soul as dark as pitch
[1:00:22] that's where you get the quote and where
[1:00:25] brother Brown says in another place that
[1:00:26] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:27] Ghost on your spirit every day of your
[1:00:29] life and die and go to hell that's the
[1:00:31] same thing this is saying right here all
[1:00:33] right the Kookaburra grows on the same
[1:00:35] water
[1:00:36] puts life into the wheat puts life into
[1:00:38] the Kookaburra but at the bottom of the
[1:00:40] Kookaburra it's got kookaburra life it's
[1:00:43] rejoicing blooming got life and doing
[1:00:45] everything that the wheat does but the
[1:00:46] soul of it is a kookaburra see false
[1:00:49] teachers can rise teaching all kind of
[1:00:51] trinitarianism and everything else and
[1:00:54] be Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:56] that's right I'm only one's a ten times
[1:00:59] and perform just as many miracles
[1:01:03] as the true gospel came
[1:01:06] the word
[1:01:07] that's what does it in other words they
[1:01:10] can't put the word together and make it
[1:01:12] stick they can't put the word together
[1:01:13] and make it right
[1:01:17] 1959 let us see God brother Brown said
[1:01:19] for in the Bible it said there was set
[1:01:21] this is brother now said this many many
[1:01:24] times and and um me and brother Richard
[1:01:26] Wilson was talking about this and you
[1:01:29] know everybody's trying to do away with
[1:01:30] the fivefold ministry right not
[1:01:31] everybody but you know you know who and
[1:01:33] you know where
[1:01:34] all right they're back with me press
[1:01:36] play that's the way you know yeah it
[1:01:39] might be the way but it may not be the
[1:01:40] way you want to go
[1:01:42] for in the Bible it said there was set
[1:01:44] Apostles prophets evangelist teachers
[1:01:46] pastors all these for the perfecting of
[1:01:49] the church all right are we are we good
[1:01:51] right here
[1:01:53] God set them in the church
[1:01:55] brother Brown didn't put him in a church
[1:01:57] brother Ram can't take them out
[1:01:59] Joseph Branham can't put him in he can't
[1:02:00] take them out
[1:02:03] God set him in the church
[1:02:05] but look now watch
[1:02:07] how brother Brown separates this though
[1:02:10] totally clears everything up for me I
[1:02:12] mean it wasn't it wasn't unclear but if
[1:02:14] somebody ever says anything about it
[1:02:15] just read them this quote they like to
[1:02:17] put on cage press play with that one on
[1:02:19] it
[1:02:21] they kind of skip over that one
[1:02:24] God set them in the church now there's
[1:02:26] nine spiritual gifts look we can lay on
[1:02:29] hands and so forth and pray earnestly
[1:02:30] for the best gift and so forth in other
[1:02:32] words anointings
[1:02:35] A.A Allen was anointed when he was
[1:02:38] praying for the sick and people got
[1:02:40] healed hey Alan didn't heal them
[1:02:42] God healed them but he was anointed
[1:02:47] but he was an alcoholic
[1:02:49] okay
[1:02:51] but those others are predestinated
[1:02:57] what those other Apostles prophets
[1:02:59] pastors so listen if they're
[1:03:01] predestinated by God there's not a man
[1:03:03] on this Earth can take that out
[1:03:06] I don't care what you say you may
[1:03:08] brother around the five-fold ministry
[1:03:09] amen back in 1960. maybe the 65 I'll
[1:03:14] agree with you he fulfilled them all
[1:03:17] but he's gone
[1:03:19] and those predestinated gifts did not
[1:03:21] leave with him
[1:03:23] God next is the second time brother
[1:03:25] Brown said that God sets them in the
[1:03:28] church they are predestinated in other
[1:03:30] words they're predetermined
[1:03:32] they are predestinated
[1:03:36] eternally from God
[1:03:38] if you're a preacher here you're going
[1:03:39] to be a preacher there
[1:03:42] if you're Prophet here you're going to
[1:03:43] be a prophet there
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:47] now watch Through the Ages it's coming
[1:03:49] now watch what he does what he says here
[1:03:51] John the Baptist was a special runner
[1:03:53] for that age
[1:03:55] what the age of the name the age of the
[1:03:58] introducing of the head from the Old
[1:04:00] Testament he stood in the middle to
[1:04:03] introduce the head or the New Testament
[1:04:05] all right
[1:04:07] nobody else could take his place
[1:04:10] he was the third coming of Elijah
[1:04:13] and nobody else is that
[1:04:16] just as brother rounds the forthcoming
[1:04:18] of Elijah nobody can take his place
[1:04:20] all right
[1:04:22] God just forordained him to do that work
[1:04:25] remember there was no Miracles done he
[1:04:28] just stood in the water and said Behold
[1:04:30] the Lamb of God that takes away the sin
[1:04:32] of the world that was his message
[1:04:35] amen do you believe that sure he did
[1:04:38] Jesus said did you go see a prophet more
[1:04:40] than a prophet see John didn't know that
[1:04:42] but Jesus knew it
[1:04:44] hear ye him 1958 brother Ram says speak
[1:04:47] the word Lord he's praying if that would
[1:04:49] be sufficient but God's good
[1:04:52] he has set in the church gifts
[1:04:55] first apostles or missionaries both the
[1:04:58] same Apostle means one cent missionary
[1:05:01] means one cent Apostles prophets
[1:05:04] teachers evangelists pastors they're all
[1:05:06] predestinated this is the second quote
[1:05:08] they are all predestinated gifts of God
[1:05:11] gifts in callings are without repentance
[1:05:13] they're placed in the church all right
[1:05:16] who's going to take them out
[1:05:19] who's gonna take them out
[1:05:21] you better not take them out you've
[1:05:22] added to or you've took away and I know
[1:05:24] what that happens in The Book of
[1:05:26] Revelations
[1:05:27] they're placed in the church to bring
[1:05:29] the church together
[1:05:31] hold it together for the glory of God
[1:05:33] hold it together
[1:05:39] all these things happen for examples
[1:05:42] and they are written for our admonition
[1:05:44] in other words the Old Testament on whom
[1:05:45] the ends of the world are coming
[1:05:50] that word example means a figure formed
[1:05:52] or blown or an impression a mark of a
[1:05:54] stroke that's what we were talking about
[1:05:55] the marring
[1:05:58] pattern of warning everything in the Old
[1:06:00] Testament was a pattern and warning to
[1:06:02] us
[1:06:04] because they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:08] in their soul they had an anointing and
[1:06:11] they had a position
[1:06:13] Moses had a position know how to
[1:06:15] position each one had a message all
[1:06:17] right
[1:06:18] but they were not born again Sons and
[1:06:21] Daughters of God
[1:06:23] only you and I because it took Jesus
[1:06:26] Christ to come here with this book that
[1:06:29] was supposed to come out in the Old
[1:06:30] Testament what you want an Old Testament
[1:06:32] then back in the beginning of time he
[1:06:35] had this book with him and it was closed
[1:06:36] and he
[1:06:39] said anything brother Brown said
[1:06:41] and the side was all
[1:06:43] right came out
[1:06:44] Genesis 1 26 came out of that man
[1:06:48] eternal life came out so that you and I
[1:06:50] could be born
[1:06:51] again
[1:06:54] when Jesus said you must be born again
[1:06:56] there was not one person during his
[1:06:58] lifetime ever fulfilled that
[1:07:02] you saw no John the Baptist he got the
[1:07:04] Holy Ghost in in the Most Holy Ghost
[1:07:06] he didn't say New Birth remember they're
[1:07:09] different
[1:07:12] y'all know that I don't have to tell you
[1:07:17] so let's go to brotherly kindness real
[1:07:18] quick
[1:07:20] and besides just giving all diligence
[1:07:22] add to your faith virtue in the virtual
[1:07:23] knowledge and all this Temperance
[1:07:24] patience patience godliness and the
[1:07:26] godliness probably kindness so now
[1:07:27] that's the anointing we're talking about
[1:07:29] so let's let's make it an anointing
[1:07:31] let's make it to where it's going to
[1:07:32] have to be something that's going to
[1:07:34] fall on us and smear us
[1:07:37] like peanut butter
[1:07:40] or honey because brother I was going to
[1:07:42] talk about honey Bean brother the kind
[1:07:43] is here in just a few minutes with that
[1:07:45] dream of sister Shepherds everybody with
[1:07:47] me wake up
[1:07:48] all right you can go sleep tomorrow wake
[1:07:50] up today don't go to sleep going home I
[1:07:53] bet you won't well act like you're
[1:07:55] driving
[1:08:00] I've always wanted to do that somebody
[1:08:01] would be asleep you can get over and get
[1:08:03] real close to the face I'm afraid I get
[1:08:04] hit
[1:08:05] brothers and sisters when you call when
[1:08:08] you look at brotherly kindness and
[1:08:10] sisterly kindness it denotes that you're
[1:08:12] from the same family when we when
[1:08:14] brother Andre hit he's my brother
[1:08:18] he's in the same family
[1:08:20] all right
[1:08:21] sister of Joyce same family all right we
[1:08:24] it denotes the same family and that's
[1:08:26] what we got to look at when we call
[1:08:27] somebody brother that means that you
[1:08:29] have a kindred you are in the same
[1:08:31] family by the new birth all right now if
[1:08:34] they don't have it that's their business
[1:08:35] but if they're your brother and they're
[1:08:37] sitting here long enough they're going
[1:08:38] to be they gonna get born again you just
[1:08:40] you just have to I want everybody to be
[1:08:42] born again and man not whatever and I
[1:08:45] want to thank everybody born again
[1:08:49] but your fruit tree will bear whether
[1:08:51] you are or not
[1:08:53] so now sixthly abroad kindness put
[1:08:56] yourself in his place on the matter I'm
[1:08:58] going to read something to you in just a
[1:09:00] few minutes John 13 verse 34 said a new
[1:09:03] commandment I give unto you now remember
[1:09:04] he's camera had all the old Commandments
[1:09:08] he knew the law
[1:09:10] he knew exactly where to find himself
[1:09:13] when he sat down in Luke and pulled a
[1:09:15] stroke now remember it wasn't a book
[1:09:19] it was a scroll so he had to unfold
[1:09:21] Scroll after scroll to find Isaiah
[1:09:24] but when he did boom he found it and I
[1:09:28] to me it just illuminated
[1:09:30] because he saw that was him
[1:09:33] how many times you've been reading the
[1:09:34] Bible Genesis 1 26.
[1:09:37] me that just that just resonates that's
[1:09:40] me
[1:09:41] that just proves where it came from and
[1:09:43] proved what I got
[1:09:45] and what family I'm in now
[1:09:48] a new commandment I give you that you
[1:09:50] love one another as I have loved you
[1:09:51] because remember the Old Testament was
[1:09:53] you shoot me I shoot you
[1:09:56] you kill my brother I kill you
[1:09:59] you committed adultery a lot of people
[1:10:00] die
[1:10:03] if it was in the new commandment praise
[1:10:05] God for Grace
[1:10:07] that you love one another as I have
[1:10:09] loved you
[1:10:11] that you also love one another by this
[1:10:13] shall all men know that you're my
[1:10:16] disciples if you love if you have love
[1:10:18] one to another or an outward display of
[1:10:23] affection under what we know as the New
[1:10:27] Testament everybody with me on that
[1:10:30] man because remember in the Old
[1:10:32] Testament you could look on a woman and
[1:10:35] lust after
[1:10:36] as long as you didn't touch her you were
[1:10:38] fine
[1:10:41] that's what the Bible says
[1:10:43] but now Jesus said now I will bring you
[1:10:45] into a new commandment here
[1:10:47] uh the Bible says Thou shalt not kill
[1:10:52] I'm gonna read you where brother Brown
[1:10:53] says if you kill somebody's influence
[1:10:55] you've killed the brother
[1:10:56] all right but let your communication be
[1:10:59] yay nay for whatsoever is more than this
[1:11:01] cometh of evil you have heard that it
[1:11:04] has been said Thou shalt love thy
[1:11:06] neighbor and hate thine enemy to last in
[1:11:07] the Old Testament
[1:11:09] but I'm saying do you love your enemies
[1:11:12] bless them that curse you
[1:11:16] how many of us have done that
[1:11:20] okay do good to them to hate you
[1:11:25] like Bob bless Wednesday night there's a
[1:11:27] holy hush going on here
[1:11:30] start talking about pride and start
[1:11:32] talking about selfishness he's talking
[1:11:33] about me and you and and our little
[1:11:37] anyway do good to them that that's you
[1:11:41] and pray for them that despitefully use
[1:11:44] you and persecute you that don't mean
[1:11:45] one time I don't about persecute you
[1:11:50] John 15 verse 9 says as the father have
[1:11:53] to love me so have I loved you continue
[1:11:55] ye in that love in other words continue
[1:11:58] ye in my Agape not my filio
[1:12:01] if you keep my command my Commandments
[1:12:05] you shall abide in my love even as I
[1:12:07] have kept my father's Commandments and
[1:12:09] abide in his love what is the love of
[1:12:11] God it's the truth
[1:12:15] sloppy affection where you got to go hug
[1:12:17] everybody and say I love you no
[1:12:19] you gotta love love truth if you love
[1:12:21] the truth that'll set you free and if
[1:12:23] you love the truth you'll love your
[1:12:24] brother
[1:12:27] look that my joy might remain in you and
[1:12:30] let your joy might be full you won't be
[1:12:32] wowzy Wows you will if you love
[1:12:33] everybody and really mean it
[1:12:37] well they gotta love me
[1:12:40] they look
[1:12:42] they got
[1:12:46] right
[1:12:47] agape love is unconditional you got to
[1:12:49] remember that
[1:12:51] feel your love is conditional agape love
[1:12:55] cannot be conditional
[1:12:58] God loved us and remember God loved us
[1:13:01] when we were white unlovable
[1:13:04] this is my commandment that you love one
[1:13:07] another as I have loved
[1:13:09] you
[1:13:11] Divine love and Sovereign Grace 1956.
[1:13:15] we're facing a day that prophes 1956.
[1:13:20] um coming up on 70 years
[1:13:25] in 2026 . now we are facing today that's
[1:13:29] prophesied to us that Brotherly Love
[1:13:31] would become a strange thing among
[1:13:33] people
[1:13:34] and it's to my humble belief that that
[1:13:36] is the greatest of all the gifts that
[1:13:38] there is in God's Bible remember he goes
[1:13:40] through and he tells you he said God
[1:13:42] God's going to come to you and say hey
[1:13:43] what gift do you want you want the gift
[1:13:45] of preaching you want to get to Healing
[1:13:47] you want to get to this he said take all
[1:13:48] them but give me love
[1:13:51] wow
[1:13:53] I call him but give me that agape love
[1:13:57] I was reminded this weekend
[1:14:00] before brother would be passed away I
[1:14:02] know some of you don't know him some of
[1:14:03] you do he did mine in June's wedding and
[1:14:06] he was a minister in the church we were
[1:14:08] at for a long time
[1:14:11] but he come he went to a we had a
[1:14:13] fellowship breakfast up there at Ruth
[1:14:15] and brother Richard and brother Whidbey
[1:14:18] were sitting together
[1:14:19] and then I came in and they were
[1:14:22] chuckling and uh
[1:14:24] and I didn't ask I just walked up you
[1:14:27] know
[1:14:28] Brother Richard said yeah brother would
[1:14:30] be you're right well he didn't tell they
[1:14:31] just went on and didn't say anything
[1:14:33] after that but Brother Richard came to
[1:14:35] me a little bit later and he said you
[1:14:36] know why we were laughing I said no he
[1:14:38] said brother would be leaned and I mean
[1:14:40] that was probably a hundred ministers
[1:14:42] because this Minister's breakfast the
[1:14:43] only ministers could come so it's
[1:14:45] probably a hundred ministers in that
[1:14:46] room
[1:14:47] he said brother would be kind of looking
[1:14:48] around you know and leaned over and he
[1:14:50] said reckon how many doctrines is in
[1:14:52] this room
[1:14:56] 100
[1:15:00] sad
[1:15:02] but true
[1:15:05] and a lot of it is pride and selfishness
[1:15:12] listen
[1:15:14] when you stand for the truth you're
[1:15:16] gonna be hated
[1:15:17] literally hated
[1:15:19] you're going to be ostracized you're
[1:15:21] going to be not
[1:15:22] allowed in a Pulpit
[1:15:25] I told you that time before some of you
[1:15:28] don't know it we went to roof meeting
[1:15:30] one time and there was about 600 of us
[1:15:32] under that brush yard room and they were
[1:15:35] just shouting and the preacher was
[1:15:36] preaching and he he preached this you
[1:15:39] know five-minute sermon that was totally
[1:15:41] not true
[1:15:44] right we were all there
[1:15:46] we were all said Brother Richard we've
[1:15:47] talked about it last weekend Brother
[1:15:49] Richard Wilson and hit some of his
[1:15:51] people were here and Dad mom me June I
[1:15:54] don't know who else was over here but
[1:15:55] they were all you know 500 and
[1:15:59] probably 80 of them
[1:16:01] were just throwing Sawdust
[1:16:03] they saw us on the floor they were just
[1:16:06] having a a shouting I mean shouting over
[1:16:09] that false Doctrine
[1:16:12] 570 or 80 of them
[1:16:15] we sat there a lot bumps on a pickle
[1:16:18] sure we were talked about afterwards
[1:16:22] because whoever this brother was
[1:16:23] preaching he was supposed to be you know
[1:16:25] he was like the
[1:16:26] high restaurant of ministers which he is
[1:16:30] a good brother and he does say some good
[1:16:32] things but that one thing was totally
[1:16:34] false and we knew that because we've
[1:16:36] been taught well but we sat there I'm
[1:16:38] not going to shout about something
[1:16:39] that's not true
[1:16:41] but buddy they all would I mean when
[1:16:43] they got finished they just kind of
[1:16:44] looked down that road and we were just
[1:16:46] sitting there
[1:16:49] God
[1:16:51] but that's what standing for the truth
[1:16:54] is
[1:16:55] that's what knowing the difference in
[1:16:57] the truth and error and thank God we had
[1:17:00] a good teacher that give us a good
[1:17:02] foundation we didn't have to learn it
[1:17:04] when we got there
[1:17:06] we walked in and when that thing went
[1:17:08] off we went like ding that's not true
[1:17:10] that's not right can't be right
[1:17:13] all right so you can say whatever you
[1:17:15] want to but I sure appreciate
[1:17:17] good teacher
[1:17:18] amen
[1:17:21] so let's talk about selfish just for a
[1:17:24] minute to be selfish is to be concerned
[1:17:25] excessively excessively with oneself
[1:17:28] selfies and I and me and oh well it's me
[1:17:32] and and selfishness is one of the
[1:17:34] biggest obstacles to having the kind of
[1:17:35] close relationship with God and each
[1:17:38] other
[1:17:39] I want to put that in there an inspiring
[1:17:42] relationships with other people that
[1:17:44] many of us desire that's well true
[1:17:47] second Timothy 3 2 says for men shall be
[1:17:49] lovers of their own selves well they
[1:17:51] already prophesied and told them that's
[1:17:52] exactly what's going to happen Covetous
[1:17:54] boasters proud
[1:17:56] Pride
[1:17:59] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:18:01] unthankful
[1:18:02] and Unholy
[1:18:04] we get up there to that meeting Saturday
[1:18:08] and what Joel Brown Say
[1:18:12] or Andre who which one was it Andrea he
[1:18:15] said parents I mean kids pray for your
[1:18:17] parents
[1:18:19] it was Joel brother Joel Brown and I
[1:18:20] knew he didn't I knew he didn't listen
[1:18:22] to me so I that must have come from God
[1:18:25] that must be God wanting us to know
[1:18:26] something because he said he said kids
[1:18:28] pray for your parents
[1:18:30] uh so that was good so made that or
[1:18:33] something to that kids
[1:18:34] pray for your parents
[1:18:36] I tell you that's what's a whole lot of
[1:18:38] the matter with people today they're not
[1:18:39] friendly like they used to be the people
[1:18:41] has got too selfish got to a place where
[1:18:43] they think they live in a little world
[1:18:45] by themselves you know that's the truth
[1:18:47] I despise oh brother Branham
[1:18:51] he despises
[1:18:53] God hates
[1:18:56] don't get quiet on me God hates
[1:18:58] there are several things he hates
[1:19:01] I despise that old somebody feel they're
[1:19:03] bigger than somebody else
[1:19:05] after all you're six foot of Earth
[1:19:07] that's all you are that's right
[1:19:09] everybody
[1:19:10] the word became flesh and ended trip I
[1:19:12] recognized the other day a selfish
[1:19:14] Spirit coming on me so in other words he
[1:19:16] wasn't exempt from a selfish Spirit
[1:19:18] coming on him all right saying this
[1:19:20] man's wrong order tell him about it
[1:19:22] that's wrong he said God's wanted to
[1:19:24] tell him about it all right let's go to
[1:19:26] the next one same message he comes to
[1:19:29] another quote another part of the sermon
[1:19:31] he said I want to ask the church one
[1:19:32] more thing before we get some place to
[1:19:34] study in the scriptures that is that
[1:19:36] you'll pray for me I've developed a
[1:19:37] critical spirit
[1:19:41] and it hops at me
[1:19:43] I told my wife yesterday the first time
[1:19:45] something happened now that I was
[1:19:46] sitting in the yard and I told her she'd
[1:19:48] remind me I told her about it I said
[1:19:49] honey I've got to a place where I've
[1:19:51] become critical of people
[1:19:53] I don't want to be whose job is it it's
[1:19:55] not mine and God's the one to criticize
[1:19:57] not me Jubilee year 1954
[1:20:02] brother Brown said I'm not going to ask
[1:20:04] you how many made the consecration but I
[1:20:06] believe many of you did
[1:20:08] and myself I did in My Heart Lord take
[1:20:11] that critical spirit from me
[1:20:16] and you know what that's what I despise
[1:20:18] I despise somebody that can't do nothing
[1:20:20] but criticize
[1:20:21] I just can't be around them don't want
[1:20:23] to be around them don't even want to
[1:20:24] listen to them
[1:20:26] constantly can't find one good thing I
[1:20:28] told somebody the other day I said that
[1:20:30] we were talking about somebody at work
[1:20:31] we were talking about somebody and uh
[1:20:34] we were talking about them being
[1:20:35] critical
[1:20:38] and I said well if they want a two
[1:20:39] billion uh one billion dollar lottery
[1:20:41] they'll complain because they didn't win
[1:20:43] too
[1:20:46] there's some people in this world that
[1:20:48] if you totally healed them and gave them
[1:20:49] 10 billion dollars they'd still find
[1:20:51] something to complain about
[1:20:56] y'all know I'm right you know those
[1:20:57] people
[1:20:59] I hope they're not here
[1:21:02] now I don't criticize people to their
[1:21:04] face now watch brother I'm done
[1:21:05] criticizing so he wasn't going to say oh
[1:21:07] you know brother Bob here
[1:21:10] just a little bit it's weird
[1:21:14] but in my heart I'm going to say the
[1:21:15] same thing Bob's weird
[1:21:17] but in my heart I do
[1:21:19] I see a lady walking down the street
[1:21:21] especially see she's not dressed proper
[1:21:22] I say isn't that awful in my heart I
[1:21:25] don't say it to nobody else after all
[1:21:27] that's her business
[1:21:30] she's a free moral agent
[1:21:32] that's why we get our problem is we get
[1:21:34] into other people's business
[1:21:36] well I'm going to preach anyway and
[1:21:38] y'all just be quiet like Pride I'm gonna
[1:21:40] get in Pride here in just a minute
[1:21:42] Bob didn't cover it enough I'm gonna
[1:21:43] smear it
[1:21:45] she's a free moral agent she ain't got
[1:21:48] no right to do it Christ bought her life
[1:21:51] but maybe she doesn't understand
[1:21:56] so it's not for me to criticize let God
[1:21:58] do it when I'm in the Pulpit now watch
[1:22:00] he backs up he says well I'm In a Pulpit
[1:22:02] I preach the gospel the best way I know
[1:22:04] how and the rest of it I commit to God
[1:22:07] he didn't save nobody he didn't change
[1:22:09] nobody's mind
[1:22:11] he didn't make no woman quit cutting her
[1:22:14] hair because he obviously he kept saying
[1:22:15] I get come back year and year and year
[1:22:17] and you cut more you cut more it
[1:22:19] probably got to him
[1:22:21] that's why he became critical Lord I
[1:22:23] preached these Pentecostal women and
[1:22:25] still their hair getting longer they get
[1:22:26] shorter
[1:22:27] every year he said I come back
[1:22:31] same way with some around here you know
[1:22:33] you tell them they need to be in church
[1:22:35] and
[1:22:36] two sniffles and a cat with diarrhea
[1:22:39] they'll be gone for two weeks
[1:22:45] Christians
[1:22:47] come to church that's all I got to say
[1:22:50] always
[1:22:52] Christians always come to church all
[1:22:54] right make Believers come every once in
[1:22:57] a while unbelievers
[1:22:59] come on Christmas and Easter like I did
[1:23:02] that's what's the matter with people
[1:23:04] today and our brother that's what's the
[1:23:05] matter with people today they're trying
[1:23:07] to pack up to be a Christian
[1:23:09] if there's anything you need is
[1:23:11] unpacking to be a Christian get to me
[1:23:14] got too many things hanging on now one
[1:23:17] of them said now mother you know
[1:23:18] couldn't go unless I took my card table
[1:23:20] with me or my iPad or my
[1:23:23] so and uh
[1:23:27] y'all ever find that app I was talking
[1:23:28] about
[1:23:31] that app is on all your phones
[1:23:34] it's not new it's been there forever
[1:23:35] look on the side it says off
[1:23:41] some of you don't do it because the
[1:23:42] bails start going off every once in a
[1:23:44] while people you know who it is because
[1:23:46] they don't sit there and reach like this
[1:23:47] they go they dive in their pocketbook so
[1:23:50] it's women anyway
[1:23:51] um because you know the other boys
[1:23:54] wouldn't appreciate me going along
[1:23:57] if I didn't have my card table
[1:24:00] and all these other little things and
[1:24:02] you have a little box of selfishness you
[1:24:04] have to hang on to that
[1:24:06] you have to hang on to tattling back
[1:24:07] biting a little of this hang on hang it
[1:24:10] on your camel well you're hanging on
[1:24:12] enough he's gonna get both legged what's
[1:24:13] old saying it's a straw that what
[1:24:16] broke the camel's back straw
[1:24:18] it's the little things
[1:24:20] the old camel can't can't hardly move
[1:24:23] he's mashed down so hard until he's
[1:24:25] bowlegged almost
[1:24:27] for the problem is with a bunch of
[1:24:29] bullet Christians we got so much hanging
[1:24:31] on to us let it out Let It Go
[1:24:34] all you see is coming up Bob
[1:24:36] look at the bottom down there
[1:24:38] oh
[1:24:39] you started it
[1:24:41] you need to unload wash up clean up get
[1:24:44] right
[1:24:46] pride is a noun
[1:24:48] Bob didn't bring that out but I'm going
[1:24:50] to
[1:24:51] a feeling of deep play pleasure or
[1:24:53] satisfaction
[1:24:55] from your own
[1:24:59] for this one I did this I did that it
[1:25:04] was my
[1:25:09] I didn't bring it but I was going to uh
[1:25:12] man bought me a red I can't remember but
[1:25:14] the Bible says pride comes before a fall
[1:25:19] right pride comes before a fall
[1:25:22] God is not going if you're a Christian
[1:25:24] God's not going to let you stay pradish
[1:25:28] you will fall
[1:25:30] and you will get a weapon like you never
[1:25:33] got before
[1:25:35] because remember pride is not just for
[1:25:38] sinners
[1:25:40] it's for us too
[1:25:42] because why would brotherly kindness be
[1:25:43] up there and tell us not to have pride
[1:25:45] not to have selfishness not to be
[1:25:47] selfish
[1:25:49] the achievements of those with whom one
[1:25:52] is closely associated are from qualities
[1:25:54] possessions that are widely admired
[1:25:59] the Bible says proud boasters
[1:26:05] I'm proud to be a Christian
[1:26:08] and I'm proud of Jesus Christ doing what
[1:26:11] he did
[1:26:12] but that's not being pradish
[1:26:14] that's being proud that you got a
[1:26:16] perfect Heavenly Father
[1:26:19] Blasphemous names real quick brother
[1:26:22] Brown said look now but in this church
[1:26:24] age the message is being poured into the
[1:26:26] church now this is the the dream of
[1:26:28] sister Shepherd which goes along with
[1:26:31] statue of a perfect man he was telling
[1:26:34] us this now black famous names I think
[1:26:36] was the next Sunday
[1:26:37] that's why in Black's famous names the
[1:26:39] first hour and a half he preached
[1:26:41] Blasphemous names he preaches he
[1:26:43] preaches the statue of perfect man again
[1:26:46] and brings a few more details that he
[1:26:48] didn't in the other sermon all right now
[1:26:50] but in this church age the message is
[1:26:52] being poured into the church
[1:26:54] what happened was remember Sister
[1:26:57] Shepard saw this man up on top of this
[1:26:59] mountain pouring pure water into a box
[1:27:02] Well the box wouldn't hold it the box
[1:27:04] was leaking and running out all over the
[1:27:07] place all right
[1:27:09] now but in this church age the message
[1:27:11] is being poured into the church but the
[1:27:13] church body is all together like the
[1:27:15] this Tabernacle will save that's where
[1:27:17] she comes to church talking about sister
[1:27:19] Shepard this Tabernacle is not a holy
[1:27:21] ghost Tabernacle there's no such a thing
[1:27:24] individuals that come into this church
[1:27:26] as Holy Ghost Tabernacles they are
[1:27:28] Tabernacles that contain the Holy Ghost
[1:27:30] but not the church in the body a group
[1:27:34] therefore it runs out
[1:27:36] but what this man who was pouring the
[1:27:39] water the messenger to the church
[1:27:42] it was him
[1:27:46] right
[1:27:47] he just didn't say it was he knew it was
[1:27:50] because he saw the vision
[1:27:52] pouring the message into the church or
[1:27:56] bride
[1:27:57] but what was the water doing it was
[1:27:59] boiling out all the trash
[1:28:04] that was in it
[1:28:06] Pride selfishness boastful
[1:28:09] that's what the Holy Spirit does balls
[1:28:12] it up now
[1:28:13] now the honey represented Brotherly Love
[1:28:16] brotherly kindness which is this age
[1:28:19] I got just through telling say
[1:28:23] of Brotherly kindness the age that we
[1:28:25] live in that was back the week before
[1:28:27] now you might say look I sure don't like
[1:28:29] brother Neville or I shouldn't like
[1:28:30] brother Jones I don't like brother
[1:28:32] so-and-so and something like that but
[1:28:34] just like something happened to him
[1:28:36] brother your heart's broke
[1:28:38] it just nearly killed you now here's
[1:28:40] where he he stopped She says see now
[1:28:43] watch we can obtain brotherly kindness
[1:28:46] and feeling for one another individually
[1:28:51] but to maintain in a group of people
[1:28:55] where everybody loves everybody with
[1:28:57] brotherly kindness hard to do
[1:29:00] that's just what brother Brown said
[1:29:01] right here right why do you care for
[1:29:04] that brother because you broke bread
[1:29:06] with him here at the altar or you will
[1:29:07] tonight taking communion you fellowship
[1:29:10] with him you shook his hand you
[1:29:11] worshiped with him he's your brother
[1:29:14] oh by the way time out
[1:29:16] do y'all want to tell you if y'all want
[1:29:18] to take communion this next weekend you
[1:29:20] can or you can wait you you decide who
[1:29:23] wants to have communion Sunday
[1:29:25] who wants to wait
[1:29:28] so we're waiting oh a couple
[1:29:32] we're waiting
[1:29:34] I don't mind if y'all take communion if
[1:29:35] I'm not here but Bob can do it
[1:29:38] well nobody voted to
[1:29:40] you didn't even vote
[1:29:42] you're supposed to write this is yes no
[1:29:45] you don't it's over with now the heart
[1:29:47] door's shut
[1:29:51] we'll do it to next weekend
[1:29:53] blame it on you you fellowship with him
[1:29:56] he shook his hand you worshiped with him
[1:29:58] he's your brother
[1:29:59] and you might do something in the flesh
[1:30:01] he might do something that you would
[1:30:03] disagree with because you just kind of
[1:30:05] stayed look which you ought to do but
[1:30:08] shun him a little
[1:30:11] come on I'm gonna let that sink in
[1:30:14] but in the bottom of your heart if
[1:30:16] something happened to that brother it'd
[1:30:18] kill you
[1:30:19] or that sister
[1:30:20] I'm an old man I was once young now I'm
[1:30:22] old I've seen it down through the age do
[1:30:25] what I hear people say I just won't have
[1:30:27] no more to do with him
[1:30:29] say we got to break down those walls of
[1:30:31] petition
[1:30:32] that's what we were talking about this
[1:30:33] weekend
[1:30:34] there are walls they need to be broke
[1:30:37] down
[1:30:38] all right we need to have brotherly
[1:30:40] kindness well they don't
[1:30:44] that's conditioned
[1:30:47] if you love me
[1:30:49] that's not what the Bible says
[1:30:52] that is not the Bible never said that
[1:30:55] the Bible says you love them whether
[1:30:57] they love you or not
[1:30:58] that's why it's hard to do
[1:31:01] oh God I let my precious brother go
[1:31:03] without making friends with him you see
[1:31:04] see his brotherly love
[1:31:07] how many times don't raise your hand but
[1:31:09] how many times have you
[1:31:11] had something against somebody
[1:31:16] and they pass away
[1:31:18] and you never were able to tell them
[1:31:22] that's what that's talking about
[1:31:28] oh God I let my precious brother go
[1:31:30] without making friends with him
[1:31:33] because why because of pride a little
[1:31:35] bit of I I mean me
[1:31:37] I'm right you're wrong
[1:31:40] well in that case you're wrong
[1:31:45] hello
[1:31:49] this is a prophet
[1:31:51] telling us how to have brotherly
[1:31:52] kindness and you look at me cross-eyed
[1:31:56] right like it's something like it's
[1:31:59] something strange this message was
[1:32:01] preached 50 60 years ago we should be
[1:32:04] able to we should have already read this
[1:32:05] message 100 times I like Blasphemous
[1:32:08] names it's a good message
[1:32:10] and right there is where it is
[1:32:12] oh God I let my precious brother go
[1:32:14] without making friends with him you see
[1:32:16] see his brotherly love it looks like it
[1:32:19] won't stick but it does stick the honey
[1:32:21] which is what brotherly love will always
[1:32:23] stick Hebrews 12 verse 14 says follow
[1:32:26] peace with all men and Holiness without
[1:32:29] which no man shall see the Lord looking
[1:32:32] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:32:35] grace of God bless any root of
[1:32:37] bitterness bringing up trouble you and
[1:32:40] thereby many be defiled remember brother
[1:32:42] Brown in a word to a church to the
[1:32:44] church just right in there on the wall
[1:32:46] oh I know it's downstairs
[1:32:48] brother Brown said don't let that come
[1:32:50] in Byram Tabernacle don't let that root
[1:32:52] of bitterness come in
[1:32:53] he said if something comes in what do
[1:32:55] you say do stick tighter together
[1:32:58] what that's the honey the brotherly
[1:33:00] kindness brotherly love anything we're
[1:33:02] going through we should stick together
[1:33:03] instead of pulling apart
[1:33:05] brother Brown said the only thing that
[1:33:07] matters get all these little differences
[1:33:08] away from me a little isms little funny
[1:33:10] feelings around you for Brethren and
[1:33:12] things like that shake it away don't let
[1:33:15] no root of bitterness ever get into your
[1:33:17] soul
[1:33:20] wow if you do it'll conquer you now
[1:33:23] those of you that are not Southerners
[1:33:25] that means
[1:33:27] ruin or you stank
[1:33:30] ER means to spoil
[1:33:34] right keep love I don't care how much
[1:33:36] people hate you
[1:33:38] you love them anyhow
[1:33:41] if you can't do that you need you ain't
[1:33:43] you ain't sealed
[1:33:45] you got a loose place yet
[1:33:50] isn't that what the Holy Spirit right up
[1:33:51] there supposed to do it's supposed to
[1:33:53] seal in the cracks
[1:33:55] seal in the cracks that we've had
[1:33:58] forever
[1:34:00] I'm sorry
[1:34:02] against other people
[1:34:05] so come on on by get that sealed up
[1:34:08] right good with the blood of Christ
[1:34:09] it'll cleanse you from all roots of
[1:34:12] bitterness yes
[1:34:14] you know the story I told you I could I
[1:34:16] wouldn't I would have been a stale
[1:34:18] Christian if I hadn't done what I did
[1:34:19] when I spoke against that brother
[1:34:24] you're not going anywhere
[1:34:26] until you get those things right
[1:34:29] you never will I don't care how much you
[1:34:31] try
[1:34:32] you'll beat your head in a wall till
[1:34:33] your nose is flat you will not move
[1:34:36] because that's going to stay right there
[1:34:39] Jehovah Jireh 1957. brother Brown said
[1:34:42] about Abraham the man of God gave Lord
[1:34:44] his choice took what's left oh I just
[1:34:46] love that a real believer will give you
[1:34:48] your choice he's willing to take what's
[1:34:51] left
[1:34:52] there's no selfishness in a real
[1:34:55] believer
[1:34:56] not at all
[1:35:00] that's why I like what Dave Ramsey
[1:35:02] always says I he says if you if you if
[1:35:05] you give if you you know let your kids
[1:35:08] borrow money
[1:35:10] that's a mistake
[1:35:12] if they need money give it to them and
[1:35:14] don't expect anything in return
[1:35:17] but we got so many people that are I'll
[1:35:20] give you this if you'll
[1:35:22] that's wrong that's right
[1:35:25] that's right I like what Dave Ramsey
[1:35:27] said he said
[1:35:28] he said if you owe your daddy your mama
[1:35:30] something he said
[1:35:31] turkey dinner at Thanksgiving don't
[1:35:33] taste very good when you have to sit
[1:35:35] there and look at them and know that you
[1:35:36] owe them money
[1:35:39] but look but when Dad says hey son here
[1:35:43] that money out that you owe me is yours
[1:35:47] it's a gift it's a gift
[1:35:53] Luke 6 verse 26 is woe unto you when all
[1:35:55] men well they get quiet again Bob and we
[1:35:58] quite a bunch I like woe unto you when
[1:36:01] all men speak well of you woe unto you
[1:36:04] when all men speak well of you for so
[1:36:06] did their fathers to the false prophets
[1:36:08] but I say unto you which here love your
[1:36:10] enemies do good to them that which hate
[1:36:13] you bless them that curse you and pray
[1:36:14] for them which despitefully use you are
[1:36:17] falsely accused but love you your
[1:36:20] enemies and do good and lent hoping for
[1:36:23] nothing again and your rewards shall be
[1:36:26] great and you shall be the children of
[1:36:27] the highest for he is kind and to the
[1:36:30] what
[1:36:31] unthankful and Evil
[1:36:34] first John 4 19 said we love him because
[1:36:36] he first loved us if a man say I love
[1:36:39] God and hates brother he is a liar for
[1:36:41] he that loveth not his brother whom he
[1:36:43] has seen how can he love God whom he
[1:36:45] hath not seen and this commandment have
[1:36:48] we from him that he who loveth God
[1:36:50] loveth his brother also First John 3 13
[1:36:53] Marvel not musicians come on Marvel not
[1:36:56] my brethren if the world hates you
[1:36:58] praise God
[1:37:00] we know that we have passed from death
[1:37:03] into life because we love the brethren
[1:37:06] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[1:37:08] and death whosoever hate us his brother
[1:37:10] is a murderer
[1:37:12] wow and you know that no murderer has
[1:37:16] eternal life abiding in him that's his
[1:37:17] Bible
[1:37:19] hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:37:21] because he laid down his life for us and
[1:37:23] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:37:25] Brethren but whoso have this world's
[1:37:27] goods and see if his brother have need
[1:37:29] and shutteth up his bowels of compassion
[1:37:31] from him how dwelleth the love of God in
[1:37:35] him my little children I said by Stan
[1:37:37] let us not love in word neither in
[1:37:41] tongue but indeed and in truth
[1:37:45] wow
[1:37:47] brother Brown in a Hebrew series you
[1:37:49] people with these saw blade tempers
[1:37:53] it's always spouting off it's a mouth
[1:37:55] that somebody can't put up things like
[1:37:57] that be careful
[1:37:59] you're guilty if you speak a word
[1:38:02] against your brother that's not right
[1:38:03] not just go around and tear down it tear
[1:38:07] it tear down it
[1:38:09] you don't have to stick a knife in a
[1:38:10] man's back to kill him
[1:38:14] you can break his character and kill him
[1:38:17] kill his influence
[1:38:19] speak against your pastor here say
[1:38:21] something bad about him you just might
[1:38:23] as well shot him
[1:38:25] told something that wasn't right about
[1:38:26] him well it'll kill his influence with
[1:38:29] the people and things like that and
[1:38:30] you're guilty of it that's what Jesus
[1:38:32] said
[1:38:33] first Peter 3 verse 8 says finally be
[1:38:36] all of One mind
[1:38:39] have compassion one of another
[1:38:41] love his Brethren be pitiful be
[1:38:44] courteous
[1:38:45] not rendering evil for evil I'll get
[1:38:47] back at him or railing for railing but
[1:38:50] contrary wise what does that word mean
[1:38:53] opposite or vice versa
[1:38:57] but contrary wise give them blessings
[1:39:00] knowing that you are there and to call
[1:39:02] that you should inherit a blessing
[1:39:06] for he that will love life and see good
[1:39:08] days let him refrain his tongue from
[1:39:10] evil and his lips that they speak no God
[1:39:15] Jesus told us right here we'll stop
[1:39:17] right here when you stand praying
[1:39:19] forgive
[1:39:21] if you have ought against any that your
[1:39:23] father also which is in heaven May
[1:39:24] forgive you your trespasses but if you
[1:39:28] do not forgive neither will your father
[1:39:30] which is in heaven forgive your
[1:39:32] trespasses
[1:39:34] that is divine forgiveness that means
[1:39:37] that he forgets forgives and forgets
[1:39:40] we can't do that because we're not
[1:39:42] Divine in that sense
[1:39:44] but he can forgive and never remember it
[1:39:45] again because remember if he if he
[1:39:48] remembers it he didn't forgive it
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:53] what sins you talking about
[1:39:56] is putting a c somewhere
[1:40:03] read this right here and then we'll stop
[1:40:05] but because of the selfishness God among
[1:40:07] it the objective was wrong signing up a
[1:40:10] bunch of stuff it would be this way when
[1:40:12] they promised they would do it for the
[1:40:13] kingdom of God I want you to listen this
[1:40:15] real quick because this happened
[1:40:18] in a situation that I was involved in
[1:40:21] and brother Dale
[1:40:23] maybe even Richard
[1:40:27] signing up a bunch of stuff it would be
[1:40:29] this way
[1:40:30] when they promised they would do it for
[1:40:32] the kingdom of God but look like it's
[1:40:33] for themselves
[1:40:35] now here's an example
[1:40:39] that happened in our life
[1:40:45] we were hunting in Kentucky
[1:40:48] and his brother
[1:40:51] he had his issues not then
[1:40:54] but he come into a lot of money so he
[1:40:57] buys this piece of property
[1:40:58] and he bills these deer stands and he
[1:41:01] spends thousands of dollars
[1:41:03] and he stands out in his little place
[1:41:07] and he and it's got a little it's got a
[1:41:09] camp there
[1:41:11] and he said he said Brothers he said I'm
[1:41:14] not a minister
[1:41:15] because he'd been married before and his
[1:41:17] wife was still living he said I know I'm
[1:41:19] not qualified to preach
[1:41:21] he said but God's given me this money
[1:41:25] to be able to buy this property it's
[1:41:27] like 400 acres and it was good property
[1:41:31] he said God's give me this and this
[1:41:33] little house here so that y'all can just
[1:41:35] come anytime you want to
[1:41:38] hunt anywhere you want to you just call
[1:41:40] me and tell me there's and it is we went
[1:41:42] up there several times Richard's been up
[1:41:44] there
[1:41:45] several times we went many times I went
[1:41:49] but everything was free I mean this food
[1:41:51] stock stacked up you know this high in
[1:41:53] the corner in the refrigerator and
[1:41:54] everywhere else and most of you know who
[1:41:55] I'm talking about but I'm not gonna call
[1:41:57] his name
[1:41:58] but at that time he was just I mean he
[1:42:00] did it he said it's my Ministry to you
[1:42:02] all right
[1:42:03] two years later now this is
[1:42:07] right here
[1:42:09] I'm doing it for the kingdom of God
[1:42:12] all right two years later
[1:42:15] he had killed a real nice buck with a
[1:42:18] bow on that property and there were
[1:42:20] others that were bigger than the one he
[1:42:23] killed
[1:42:26] and he was getting ready to go somewhere
[1:42:28] else
[1:42:29] I was sitting in the living room I don't
[1:42:31] think Richard was there but Daddy was
[1:42:32] there
[1:42:34] and and he walks outside and he turns
[1:42:36] around he comes back in he says bro wait
[1:42:37] he said
[1:42:39] you tell me he said you're in charge you
[1:42:42] tell me though
[1:42:44] if so and so if anybody goes to this
[1:42:46] so-and-so place
[1:42:50] I said really
[1:42:52] to myself I said really two years ago
[1:42:54] you told us we were free to hunt
[1:42:56] anywhere we want to anytime we wanted to
[1:42:57] because that was your ministry
[1:43:01] and so he goes on and he says I don't
[1:43:02] want nobody hunting there for anybody in
[1:43:04] Hunts there they can't hunt here no more
[1:43:07] well he had found this big deer on the
[1:43:09] camera
[1:43:11] and he didn't want nobody to hunt it but
[1:43:13] him
[1:43:15] now two years ago
[1:43:19] it would be this way when they promised
[1:43:21] they would do it for the kingdom of God
[1:43:24] but looked like they did it for themself
[1:43:26] so he got selfish
[1:43:28] he didn't want nobody to go over there
[1:43:29] brother John he said if anybody goes
[1:43:31] over there I can't hear in here no more
[1:43:35] less than one year
[1:43:38] less than one year yeah I think y'all
[1:43:40] went last less than one year
[1:43:43] from that day when he said that to me
[1:43:46] he lost everything he had
[1:43:48] everything
[1:43:51] almost lost his marriage
[1:43:54] but he lost everything
[1:43:56] I saw a check one time a commission
[1:43:58] check was three hundred thousand dollars
[1:44:00] commission check that he made at one
[1:44:03] time now it wasn't one year that was one
[1:44:04] time
[1:44:05] that he had that much money and he was
[1:44:07] doing so well and and then after that
[1:44:10] guess what his life fell apart
[1:44:13] he went out in the world he just almost
[1:44:15] went crazy
[1:44:16] he owed a lot of people money
[1:44:20] but he didn't do it for the glory of God
[1:44:22] like he said he was going to do it he
[1:44:24] promised
[1:44:25] he promised all us ministers he promised
[1:44:27] to all of us people here's you a
[1:44:29] sanctuary a place you can come and you
[1:44:31] can hunt you can just sit back and relax
[1:44:33] and enjoy yourself and I'll take care of
[1:44:36] everything
[1:44:37] then two years later
[1:44:39] he says no you can't hunt over there
[1:44:44] because he want he was in some kind of
[1:44:45] big deer contest and he knew that deer
[1:44:47] was over there and he didn't want
[1:44:48] anybody kill it but himself
[1:44:51] brother Brown said it won't work no
[1:44:53] selfish thing will work your motives and
[1:44:55] objectives has to be exactly perfectly
[1:44:58] right then you have faith to ask because
[1:45:01] if you don't
[1:45:03] you'll lose everything you got
[1:45:06] so let's be careful but let's learn from
[1:45:08] that
[1:45:10] because it was something that he that
[1:45:12] just I mean it almost destroyed him he
[1:45:14] almost committed suicide
[1:45:16] and lost everything he had like I said
[1:45:18] before now he's back in church now he's
[1:45:21] doing better but he lost like 10 years
[1:45:22] of his life
[1:45:23] because of one thing he did he became
[1:45:26] selfish
[1:45:27] of something that he said that God told
[1:45:31] him to do and gave him the money to do
[1:45:33] see what I mean
[1:45:36] watch your motive and objective we had a
[1:45:38] brother not several years ago that he
[1:45:41] come up with this great idea that God
[1:45:43] told him that to work on Sunday because
[1:45:44] you get paid like triple time if you
[1:45:46] work on Sunday so he worked on Sunday so
[1:45:48] he could send money to the missionary
[1:45:50] field
[1:45:51] and quit going to church
[1:45:53] God didn't tell him that
[1:45:57] so who did
[1:45:59] it was either herself or the devil
[1:46:01] because guess what his life fell apart
[1:46:03] he quit going to church
[1:46:06] listen you can't out give God but you
[1:46:10] can't outsmart him either
[1:46:12] hey man you cannot outsmart God he knows
[1:46:15] already what you're going to do and he
[1:46:17] knows what he's going to do but he's
[1:46:19] going to let you go like he did those
[1:46:21] Brothers he's going to let you go cause
[1:46:22] free more agent hey you said it
[1:46:25] so let's be careful of the promises that
[1:46:28] we make
[1:46:29] let's sing a song real quick one song
[1:46:31] but that's life lesson
[1:46:37] with swift transition if you have a need
[1:46:41] real quick

[1:47:01] [Music]
[1:47:09] sing it to him
