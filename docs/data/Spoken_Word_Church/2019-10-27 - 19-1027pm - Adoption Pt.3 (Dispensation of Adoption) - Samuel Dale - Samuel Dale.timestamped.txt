[22:29] realization that your God and you change
[22:33] not Lord will see into this and our
[22:36] thoughts and ideas that you never change
[22:38] so then it's easy to follow you through
[22:42] the dispensations in your word because
[22:45] they'll everyone carne out to be the
[22:47] same and point to the right order we
[22:49] love you and we thank you bless them God

[23:02] we've heard Lord of how much things is
[23:05] going he's wanting to go home he's he
[23:07] won't come to eat he's wanting all the
[23:09] things Lord we just thank you for that
[23:12] let me ask you to got us forgive our
[23:15] sins and keep us in Jesus name seasons 1
[23:24] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[23:27] will of God to the Saints which were at
[23:28] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[23:31] Jesus grace be to you and peace from God
[23:34] our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[23:35] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[23:39] our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed
[23:42] us with all spiritual blessings in
[23:45] heavenly places in Christ according as
[23:49] he had chosen us in him
[23:51] liyan before the
[23:53] nation of the world that we should be
[23:55] holy and without blame before him in
[23:57] love having predestinated us unto the
[24:02] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[24:06] himself according to the good pleasure
[24:08] of his will to the praise of the glory
[24:11] of His grace wherein he hath made us
[24:14] accepted in the beloved in whom we have
[24:17] redemption through his blood the
[24:18] forgiveness of sins according to the
[24:21] riches of His grace wherein he hath
[24:24] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[24:26] prudence having made known unto us the
[24:29] mystery of his will what is the mystery
[24:32] of his will to adopt us that's just the
[24:37] plain as can be as the thought you'll
[24:39] see having made known unto us the
[24:42] mystery of his will according which
[24:44] according to his good pleasure which he
[24:48] hath purposed in himself what that in
[24:51] the dispensation of the fullness of
[24:52] times he might gather together in one
[24:55] all things in Christ both which are in
[24:57] heaven and which are on earth even in
[25:00] him in whom also we have obtained an
[25:02] inheritance being predestinated
[25:05] according to the purpose of him who
[25:07] worketh all things after the counsel of
[25:11] his own will that we should be to the
[25:13] praise of his glory who has trusted in
[25:15] Christ in whom he also trusted after
[25:18] that ye heard the word of truth the
[25:20] gospel of your salvation whom also after
[25:23] that you believed you were sealed with
[25:26] that holy spirit of promise now when the
[25:30] Bible speaks it like that it means
[25:32] singular there is no more see it doesn't
[25:36] just say were sealed with a Holy Spirit
[25:41] it says with that it's making a point
[25:45] that singular bringing it out a promise
[25:49] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[25:51] until the redemption of the purchased
[25:53] possession unto the praise of his glory
[25:56] and let's go to Ecclesiastes called who
[25:58] a picker thought after we get on over
[26:01] into the message a little verse 3 says
[26:05] now you hear this quarter
[26:07] there's a there's a time for all things
[26:12] that's not in the scripture it's not a
[26:15] time for all things
[26:18] because that would mean there would be a
[26:20] time to die to be you have problem
[26:22] there's it doesn't say it now listen
[26:24] read it right there as you're seeing it
[26:26] to everything there is a season and a
[26:30] time to every purpose under the heaven
[26:33] there's not a time for it there's a time
[26:36] to it okay a time to be born and a time
[26:41] to die a time to plant and a time to
[26:45] pluck that which is planted a time to
[26:48] kill a time to heal a time to break down
[26:51] and a time to build up so you get to
[26:53] point from that that it's not saying
[26:55] it's a time far because there's this if
[26:58] you make it far you and make it the
[27:00] wrong thing but there is a time to or a
[27:03] time this will take place are you
[27:07] following me the time will take place
[27:10] that is to a time to kill the time to
[27:13] steal the time to do it will take place
[27:15] but it's not just sit like lamb and
[27:20] that's it and you say well it's the time
[27:22] for the notes of time to that so
[27:25] remember that is we go along father we
[27:27] thank you in Jesus name Amen
[27:29] you may be seated now we're trying to
[27:33] whether Louise is going to interpret so
[27:36] I will I'm very slow anyway but I will
[27:41] try to slow down just a little bit and
[27:45] that will help him to follow on in
[27:51] interpreting all right now we read in
[27:57] Ephesians that there's a dispensation of
[28:01] adoption right a dispensation
[28:07] what is a dispensation it's the time
[28:15] are a setpoint
[28:19] assault or something you know as a
[28:21] dispensation if something made now you
[28:25] studying the message you'll do this run
[28:27] across it you hear brother branham and
[28:29] I'm going to put it on here I like to do
[28:31] that to wear that you can think about
[28:33] what it is you hear him say I am NOT a
[28:36] dispensationalism alright
[28:41] but then in another message maybe the
[28:44] next room maybe that same message he
[28:45] said I am a dispensationalist alright
[28:51] now he's saying it both ways and you say
[28:54] well what is he which one is he will
[28:58] read you know where he says he's a
[28:59] dispensationalists and we'll all be
[29:01] dispensation is all right that's true if
[29:05] you believe now listen that it we're all
[29:08] E and we're living in a dispensation a
[29:10] time a place a point that's more or less
[29:15] the dispensation is something set and
[29:18] we're living in a set time there was a
[29:22] times I'll read in a minute of the
[29:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:25] all right now that doesn't mean it's
[29:27] gone listening it doesn't mean it was
[29:32] here and then left see that would be if
[29:35] you were just saying I believe in a
[29:37] dispensation you just say well I believe
[29:40] in the dispensation of the baptism of
[29:42] the Holy Ghost well then you would be
[29:44] backing out see from that and would be
[29:48] saying I don't believe that's here
[29:50] anymore
[29:51] no it may be carnal for you to my way of
[29:55] thinking but the Hebrews 13:8 he's the
[30:00] same yesterday today and forever so he
[30:02] never changes his nature his ways and
[30:04] beings he doesn't change down through
[30:07] there because he's the same but there's
[30:10] a time to things alright now don't
[30:16] misunderstand I said then don't think
[30:18] there's a time far see the baptism is
[30:22] there's not a time for the baptism when
[30:23] those goes that's my point we've always
[30:26] said you listen to anybody quote
[30:28] includes the
[30:30] 90% of the time they will quote a time
[30:32] for all things
[30:33] or they'll say in the Bible is a time
[30:36] there's not a time for it's a time to
[30:41] the that way you can have a dispensation
[30:45] move into another dispensation have them
[30:49] running parallel with each other are
[30:51] together and it's not one being far and
[30:54] the other one it's the time to know
[30:58] that's okay now I have to express things
[31:03] my way and I didn't want you to
[31:05] especially you that study the message of
[31:07] the Prophet to when I would say brother
[31:11] Branham is the dispensation well I've
[31:13] got quotes where he says he ain't well
[31:15] okay I've got him to know but then you
[31:19] say he'd say I I don't believe in
[31:22] different sizes so well he don't believe
[31:24] in dispensation did he'd say I do
[31:25] believe in the dispensation well then
[31:28] you got to get it clear what he's
[31:29] talking about
[31:30] okay so there's a dispensation for this
[31:33] a dispensation for this a dispensation
[31:36] and they all can overlap each other
[31:44] there's a dispensation throughout the
[31:46] ages of justification thing all right
[31:53] then there's a dispensation of
[31:54] sanctification does that do away with
[31:56] justification no they go together
[32:00] see that's why that you'll hear the
[32:02] prophets say I'm not a dispensation
[32:05] then you say I am a distance I read what
[32:07] he's talking about so the you know that
[32:11] will get you a time to all things not
[32:16] far to them clear it up to you to help
[32:20] you okay now what is that point talking
[32:22] about in the Bible using the
[32:25] terminologies of adoption okay and in
[32:29] that form we have Paul picking up
[32:33] especially using the words adoption
[32:36] Peter doesn't necessarily use the word
[32:39] adoption when he's covering it through
[32:41] the statute of a perfect man in second
[32:43] Peter but Paul is covering the word of
[32:45] adoption
[32:46] I like Paul's writings I don't discredit
[32:49] the others but I like Paul's writings
[32:52] because Paul's writings are specific
[32:55] they're to the point you know that they
[32:59] say what they mean and mean what they
[33:00] say and and it all comes out to the
[33:04] right order okay all right see Paul in
[33:08] Galatians you'll be talking about
[33:13] adoption okay he be coming through and
[33:18] showing you the forms of adoption which
[33:22] he's taking the Old Testament that's you
[33:24] know one reason I love you you think it
[33:26] doesn't mean nothing but do you know I
[33:30] try to explain things and I'm maybe not
[33:32] shooting a lot of times but I like for
[33:35] everybody to understand the ended odd
[33:38] that Paul wrote the communion message
[33:43] explained the communion the Paul wasn't
[33:47] there with the Lord Jesus when the
[33:49] communion was served Peter explains
[33:52] other things why would it not have been
[33:54] for Peter to explain the communion see
[34:02] because Peter was not an Old Testament
[34:05] form in his studies and bringing it
[34:10] forth Paul could take anything back into
[34:13] the Old Testament because he had all of
[34:16] that background that studying of the
[34:18] Word of God so he would know what
[34:21] happens in the communion and knowing
[34:24] like Wade was bringing out that time you
[34:26] know that there'd be a plate left this
[34:29] is for Elijah we'll see
[34:31] Paul was the only one that would have
[34:32] known that others would have not have
[34:34] known you know those things
[34:36] Paul had that set background
[34:38] understanding so in his understanding he
[34:41] understood adoption and he would try to
[34:44] explain it how that in the Old Testament
[34:47] they had the the son born into the
[34:50] family all right he's a son
[34:53] he's an error he's a child
[34:57] for that family okay then Paul picks it
[35:01] up and shows that he is he's given a
[35:04] tutor a governor a school masters we've
[35:08] read in Galatians our four three four
[35:10] five and he's given those to tutor him
[35:14] and bring into the position of the
[35:16] nature of the father
[35:17] all right so Paul understands what
[35:21] that's saying
[35:22] see he's following it from the point of
[35:25] the son being a son then the son is
[35:28] brought into deeper meanings
[35:32] you know sonship becomes a greater word
[35:34] for the father when he becomes Oh Zak in
[35:38] here but he he will get it one of these
[35:40] days when he finds out and that baby
[35:42] they're in and all the other things it
[35:45] changes things when you got children
[35:47] right you start understanding a little
[35:50] bit more about what the Bible's saying
[35:52] when it says be the child that won't die
[35:58] but that's what it says now it doesn't
[36:02] mean you know for you to beat him with a
[36:04] big old stick and wear him over the head
[36:05] and beat him to death no all right we
[36:08] know better than that but it's just that
[36:10] point but see Paul he uses his term to
[36:14] say a son is born into the family and he
[36:18] says then the father gives the son a
[36:20] tutor a razor to teach him and he tries
[36:25] to instill into that child the nature of
[36:28] the father to where he can run the
[36:30] business to do the things etc and he
[36:34] comes to the point that he can be
[36:36] trusted
[36:36] all right and then see Paul then does a
[36:40] marvelous point because as I said this
[36:44] morning I emphasize this point that
[36:47] there is no third stage of adoption in
[36:50] the Old Testament there's not something
[36:53] that you go on to it stops there it
[36:57] stops it has the sonship and then it has
[37:00] the tutor and the manifestation than the
[37:03] time but then it this kind of stops
[37:06] because that's what it stopping all
[37:09] right but
[37:10] when Paul comes to the New Testament he
[37:12] uses that as a background looking at it
[37:15] and he said okay he brings out adoption
[37:21] has to be in the Sun coming into the
[37:24] family and that's the new birth right
[37:29] the new birth you come into the family
[37:31] of God by the new birth
[37:33] then you have your tutor our trainer
[37:35] which is the Holy Ghost to teach you
[37:37] these things and it brings you to a
[37:39] place to where you can call it sonship
[37:42] which means that the Sun is getting more
[37:45] than nature of the father and it's
[37:47] coming into what God has wanted he wants
[37:50] us to be all right
[37:53] then he brings it in to that as
[37:55] manifestation there from Romans 8 that
[37:58] he brings the manifestation of the sons
[38:00] and daughters of the Living God to her
[38:03] that they can have God's nature his ways
[38:05] his authority all of the things but then
[38:08] there's more to it
[38:09] and Paul sums it up as we will bring
[38:11] into 20/20 third verse of Romans 8 there
[38:15] - where he covers then that it's Paul
[38:17] says the adoption to wit the redemption
[38:22] of the body see he's picked that Old
[38:25] Testament point up into a higher order
[38:27] and bring in clearer understanding of
[38:31] what it means for us but then he's
[38:33] bringing it to the redemption of the
[38:36] body because that's the one thing that
[38:38] we need and that's what man has always
[38:40] missed I'm I'm not throwing awful
[38:43] nobody's doctor and their ideas or
[38:45] denominations or whatever that's them
[38:47] but they just didn't have the
[38:49] understanding now some of them taught
[38:52] about these things we talked about
[38:54] adoption in the Baptist Church we had
[38:56] things we had Studies on adoption in the
[38:59] Baptist Church all right we had some
[39:02] things we understood but yet we couldn't
[39:05] bring it out clearly it's you know in
[39:09] other words it never went to where we
[39:11] went this morning where we go this
[39:13] morning when it brought to a point of
[39:14] what that it come to the adoption to wit
[39:17] the redemption of the body to understand
[39:20] the redeeming of this body
[39:23] now see that's contrary to
[39:25] denominationalism and high for the
[39:28] message isms now if that's wrong for me
[39:31] to say it that way I'm just saying it
[39:33] most of the people this message believe
[39:35] you're gonna get a new body now you
[39:40] wouldn't think that would still be when
[39:41] after all the prophet has said that it's
[39:44] this body redeemed
[39:46] he already taught this body redeemed not
[39:49] gets you a new one will see us in the
[39:52] denominations I'm serious not making no
[39:54] joke but we believe that the Holy Ghost
[39:58] was enough to save us but we just didn't
[40:02] bring him as enough in him to be able to
[40:05] regain these bodies because I got a
[40:09] smoke I've got a drink I got a - I got a
[40:11] do you know he all tied up in in life
[40:14] and you see and I can't help that well
[40:17] the Bible says you can show that so you
[40:20] know but that's the point see then when
[40:23] you come to seeing Paul brings it into a
[40:27] wonderful situation that then he takes
[40:30] it from the sonship part takes it on in
[40:33] to the redeeming of this body
[40:36] the Bible says we'll have a glorious
[40:38] body like unto his body what do you want
[40:42] a new body did Jesus raised in a
[40:46] different body or was it the same body
[40:48] that went down now according to my Bob
[40:51] well he came forth with no offense in
[40:53] his hand I mean that's according to the
[40:55] Bible then he had to nail friends he
[40:59] didn't have a new body
[41:01] he had that body made new and that's
[41:05] what I want I don't want another body
[41:06] I've enjoyed this little guy living you
[41:10] know I think he's the best-looking
[41:11] fellas in the country and my wife all
[41:13] agree we in secret
[41:18] but think about it now see we were the
[41:24] adoption that he's bringing there was
[41:26] nothing to show in that Old Testament
[41:28] about redeeming this body why are you
[41:32] with me
[41:33] then I'm trying to make the point of the
[41:35] message to relate it in and I try to tie
[41:39] each service together see there was
[41:41] nothing back there talking about this it
[41:44] would always gonna get a new gonna get a
[41:48] new C even when you come in to the New
[41:51] Testament Paul and him understood we was
[41:54] not going to get a new body but they
[41:57] lost that understanding down through the
[41:59] ages and come out with that we're going
[42:03] to get a new body well why would we want
[42:06] a new body why would we want a different
[42:09] body from what we live in that wouldn't
[42:14] be anything that's not Redemption that's
[42:16] replacement you say well I believe in
[42:21] Redemption well but I'm gonna get me a
[42:23] new body you know I got smoking
[42:26] cigarettes I gotta I can't stand without
[42:28] all you understand there's a lot to the
[42:35] Bible did we get it clear and bring out
[42:39] a lot of points to where that we would
[42:41] understand see when that then it's the
[42:44] redemption of this body that you and I
[42:46] are concerned with I'm not concerned
[42:50] right now with the rapture I'm not well
[42:57] don't you want to go to heaven what
[43:00] cause according to my understanding of
[43:03] the Bible wherever God is is where I
[43:05] want to be well I thought he was right
[43:08] here I thought he was here living in his
[43:11] people well why do I want to go to
[43:13] heaven he's not there he's in these
[43:18] people down here ain't it glorious that
[43:22] one day we'll finish the whole thing up
[43:23] right here you mean out of it don't you
[43:26] think feel glorious about that out of
[43:28] the universe of it is of all of the
[43:30] stuff
[43:31] the moon the planets the things that are
[43:33] that God chose this to be the center of
[43:35] the universe and we're going to live
[43:37] right here we're not going to live
[43:41] somewheres else we're not going to Pluto
[43:42] Mars or whatever we're gonna be right
[43:45] here because this is where we come from
[43:48] that's where our bodies come from our
[43:53] bodies come out of this earth right why
[43:57] would we want to go to another I'll get
[43:58] on one thought like that and it is it
[44:00] gets me because you know it gets me
[44:03] because people don't see the simplicity
[44:06] of the truth but it gets me to think of
[44:10] the joy that we can have about what we
[44:11] do see all right so then are you
[44:14] following me now this morning we were
[44:15] doing that the child born into the
[44:18] family tops the baptism with the Holy
[44:22] Ghost that you receive through Jesus
[44:24] Christ all right then sonship comes into
[44:29] view in the Old Testament as the son is
[44:31] brought up through the nature and the
[44:33] things of the father until a time of his
[44:36] inheritance rights are his doing that
[44:40] Bar Mitzvah things you know the son of
[44:43] so-and-so is what it means we'll give
[44:46] you the definitions a lot of times I
[44:47] can't pronounce the words but but that's
[44:50] alright let's see it comes to that
[44:52] position but then it broke off back
[44:55] there because there was no way to it was
[44:58] not even way there to talk about
[44:59] redemption as to understand now they
[45:02] were saying said in the Bible because
[45:04] that's what we're gonna get to see
[45:06] adoption is a mystery we're ready to
[45:11] defeasance it's a mystery you know what
[45:16] a mystery is something that's not
[45:18] understood is that a good definition for
[45:21] a mystery something that's not fully
[45:24] understood is mysterious well I see
[45:28] there was nobody in the Old Testament
[45:29] could bring out the mystery and now the
[45:33] disciples when they begin Paul is
[45:35] bringing this out he's bringing out the
[45:38] mystery we read it there in Ephesians
[45:40] the mystery of adoption
[45:45] alright now watch this about a
[45:48] dispensational parties we talk about see
[45:51] and you'll see one brother branham would
[45:53] one time say you didn't believe in a
[45:54] dispensation or tell anyone
[45:56] see I believe in a dispensation that
[45:57] contains all of the things of adoption
[46:00] if it's going to be anodized it's going
[46:02] to be a dispensation of adoption then
[46:07] that means everything about redemptive
[46:10] plan is included in that dispensation
[46:15] justification sanctification baptism of
[46:17] the Holy Ghost the new birth bringing
[46:20] you up through the body of Christ
[46:21] bringing you out through the statue of a
[46:22] perfect man bringing you to sonship all
[46:26] of it is in that dispensation and that's
[46:28] Hebrews 13:8 it never changes so Fred
[46:33] wrote said I believe in dispensation if
[46:35] we're reading it but then when he would
[46:37] say I don't believe in the dispensation
[46:38] would be for you to go partner on
[46:40] something and break off and not put it
[46:43] all together see if you can't put it all
[46:49] together it's not a dispensation it's a
[46:53] split condition then I'll be the way to
[46:56] say it but that's what it is it's not a
[46:58] dispensation a dispensation is really a
[47:01] time to that you know you can call it
[47:08] into the you know I've looked it up so
[47:11] go ahead and you look it up and you'll
[47:12] see it's a dispensation can go to
[47:14] leadership it can go to you know
[47:19] ministries and and things like that but
[47:23] I like the point of this putting it in
[47:25] plain language the dispensation is a
[47:27] time that's why I chose please est
[47:31] because our thinking on day and I
[47:33] thought what would I put there and it
[47:35] just Ecclesiastes says the time - not a
[47:38] time for a time - because that way you
[47:45] got Hebrews 13:8 see this that we're
[47:50] talking about now over the dispensation
[47:54] and going to bring in to talk about the
[47:56] adoption system you realize what I'm
[47:58] getting at
[47:58] the disciples had this but they didn't
[48:02] have the redemption of the body you know
[48:05] what I mean they didn't have that that
[48:06] to take it on to the change they had to
[48:09] understand him Paul had to understand
[48:11] him but the Lord would descend from
[48:14] heaven with a shout he had to understand
[48:16] it but he never reached that position
[48:18] he's in the grave today the Apostle Paul
[48:22] is in the grave today waiting on you and
[48:24] I'll corner Hebrews 11:40 that they
[48:27] without us cannot be made perfect
[48:29] he's waiting all of those people are
[48:32] waiting
[48:35] awaiting a time - not a time for that
[48:41] would be something you look out tires
[48:42] well we'll get out that one of these
[48:43] days well we will find it out there or
[48:46] well we we've done went through it back
[48:48] you under you remember the story now
[48:50] we're not looking back we're not looking
[48:51] forward we're trying to look around
[48:53] exactly where we are now and where we
[48:56] are now standing in the most glorious to
[48:58] me the most glorious time that has ever
[49:02] been in this world to me is right now a
[49:08] time to understand the redemption of the
[49:18] body not have to depend upon the fact
[49:23] that it will go by the grave and have to
[49:25] come out that's why I'm saying I want to
[49:30] go I don't look for the rapture
[49:32] well because my Bible says the dead in
[49:36] Christ shall rise first so I'm looking
[49:38] for the resurrection the resurrection is
[49:42] my next out of mind a time - and that's
[49:51] hide together where we can stay in the
[49:52] whole thing's all right get it you know
[49:54] what I'm talking about
[49:56] the child may be heir of all things but
[50:00] not able to claim anything in the right
[50:03] of what it's to be don't go out and and
[50:07] hand your kids the key to the car
[50:12] right wait until they grow up then after
[50:18] they grow up you set down the side of
[50:20] them and you say that is a break that
[50:24] stops it that is a gas that moves it
[50:27] don't swap them and so if you do you get
[50:33] it
[50:34] you know all right I'm a secret Amish
[50:37] I'm a kid but dead serious right
[50:40] you don't trust a child with those
[50:43] things you wait until they grow up and
[50:46] see now you've heard the Prophet sit
[50:49] like this he said people will take a
[50:51] person off of the band floor we're
[50:54] playing the guitar and worldly music
[50:56] said the next day they'll have him in
[50:57] the pulpit preaching he said you don't
[51:02] do that you don't put it out of it as I
[51:06] was saying this morning you had no
[51:08] novice writing the word tell me one
[51:12] novice show me one child writing the
[51:15] Gospels no you have someone who has
[51:20] grown to maturity that knows what they
[51:24] mean and that's a wonderful appalled
[51:26] that Paul had already these background
[51:28] behind him the background of of the
[51:33] scriptures I thank God you can say what
[51:36] you want to about Enza I thank God for
[51:38] my background because in my background
[51:42] we studied things we just didn't play
[51:46] around
[51:46] we studied things I didn't believe in it
[51:51] I couldn't explain how the body part was
[51:53] but I didn't necessarily believe was
[51:55] gonna get something different you know I
[51:58] couldn't explain it there's a lot of
[52:00] that stuff I couldn't explain but I at
[52:02] least had some knowledge or thinking I
[52:04] don't you you might say that's God I
[52:07] don't I'm old denomination has taught me
[52:09] wrong they didn't teach you no more than
[52:10] what you what you wanted to be taught
[52:16] don't blame them you remember the other
[52:19] day when I bring brother Branham says
[52:22] they're denominations with a
[52:23] schoolmaster
[52:25] did you ever any of you go home and look
[52:27] that up
[52:30] he said the denomination's was a
[52:32] schoolmaster to bring us to Christ a
[52:34] teacher a tutor a razor boy they
[52:39] engraved me they taught me wrong
[52:42] well what about now yeah all right but
[52:48] now listen a dispensation is like a time
[53:02] and the problem we think of it is we
[53:06] want to make it this way let it stop I
[53:08] don't believe that is why I believe
[53:10] ready run didn't believe in that well he
[53:12] didn't believe in the dispensation where
[53:13] something goes off and stops he believed
[53:17] in it continually opening up I believe
[53:24] that the gospel cause Paul spoke of a
[53:27] dispensation of the gospel that was
[53:29] given unto him and we know that's true
[53:33] because the Gentiles were Paul was given
[53:36] to the Gentiles to bring the Word of God
[53:38] so you could say the dispensation of the
[53:40] Gentiles was in its leadership by the
[53:43] Apostle Paul to bring forth the word
[53:46] okay then bringing it to that point to
[53:52] everything there is a season all right
[53:57] so let's hold that in the dispensation
[54:01] as he says first Corinthians 9 17 said a
[54:05] dispensation of the gospel is committed
[54:08] unto me Ephesians 1 and 10 that in the
[54:12] dispensation of the fullness of time he
[54:14] might gather in one all things in Christ
[54:18] seasons
[54:19] I guess it's two and thirty two or three
[54:21] and three and two if you have heard of
[54:24] the dispensation of the grace of God
[54:26] which is given me to you the Gentiles
[54:32] wherever I am made a minister Colossians
[54:35] 1 according to the dispensation of God
[54:39] which is given to each one of us to
[54:42] fulfill the word the a dispensation of
[54:47] time a situation ra is something that's
[54:52] to happen at that point to be able to
[54:56] you to be able to follow into that line
[55:00] and come out of that with the right
[55:02] understanding okay
[55:04] now trying to get to the point a
[55:07] dispensation because the cleese ESDS is
[55:11] is explaining that there's a time to not
[55:15] far there's a time to all things all
[55:22] right
[55:23] a point a situation something did sure
[55:26] to come to all right now think about
[55:31] these things the world we ended up this
[55:34] morning talking about the manifestation
[55:39] of the sons and daughters of God from
[55:41] Hebrews 8 about 2021 right in there all
[55:48] right
[55:48] talking about the time of the
[55:51] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[55:53] of the Living God that the whole world
[55:55] is groaning waiting right the whole
[56:00] world is groaning way to the corner
[56:02] Romans there for the manifestation of
[56:04] the sons of God waiting for a time that
[56:09] the children can come to the position to
[56:11] realize who they are and what we're
[56:13] doing here you realize we're here to
[56:15] finish this up if not what's going to
[56:19] finish it I'm you know I'm not throwing
[56:23] no slimes throwing it straight like it
[56:25] is what's gonna finish it you say well
[56:28] it's this well alright I still waiting
[56:30] on me and you because that can't come
[56:32] till this comes you understand why is
[56:35] that runs a dispensation buddies no they
[56:37] cannot become something over here until
[56:40] this here is made manifest for that to
[56:43] be able to build on that's Hebrews 13
[56:46] it has to keep unfolding and that
[56:49] prophet as he would try to bring forth
[56:51] to you and I the message of the last
[56:53] days in the dispensation of bread you
[56:58] know there was even a dispensation of
[56:59] John the Baptist you know all of those
[57:05] things has disciplines our time a time
[57:07] to that John the Baptist was to come on
[57:10] the scene and bring his message there
[57:12] was a dispensation from Malachi for Luke
[57:14] seventeen thirty revelations ten seven
[57:16] as to all of that that would come in our
[57:20] day and our time to turn the hearts back
[57:25] the things that are said in the
[57:27] scripture but not are we going to just
[57:29] stop because we look at it now and say
[57:32] well that's fifty years ago did it stop
[57:34] you don't believe in Hebrews 13:8 if it
[57:37] did gonna put it that play you say well
[57:43] it's just over with hearing or whether
[57:46] you're not listening that's not a time
[57:50] to you got to town for something and
[57:53] that's gonna mess you up see because
[57:58] we're living in a dispensation now
[58:03] remember my point a minute ago then a
[58:05] dispensation means one thing the
[58:07] anything that is to be revealed into
[58:09] that period of time as part of that
[58:11] dispensation all right now listen is I'm
[58:17] trying to get it let's let's pick up the
[58:19] Prophet and read just a little bit this
[58:20] afternoon because I we all know who who
[58:23] met what God sent to us to believe in
[58:26] what would try to Caprice and teach that
[58:29] God sent a prophet to the last days all
[58:31] right so go ahead go ahead number two
[58:33] we've done covered number one talking
[58:36] about a sonship go ahead to number two
[58:38] on adoption you believe in dispensation
[58:43] Bible said so in the dispensation of the
[58:45] fullness of time what is the fullness of
[58:48] time there's been a dispensation of well
[58:51] there was a know what is fullness of
[58:54] time when time is fulfilled that simple
[58:59] what's the fullness of time when time is
[59:01] fulfilled when a dispensation comes to
[59:05] closing out of that situation all right
[59:08] listen
[59:09] but if the fullness of time there's been
[59:12] a dispensation of well there was a
[59:14] dispensation of the Mosaic law there was
[59:17] a dispensation of John the Baptist
[59:20] there was a dispensation of Christ
[59:22] there's a dispensation of church
[59:24] organization there's dispensation of the
[59:28] outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[59:29] now father each one and listen now now
[59:36] the dispensation of adoption all right
[59:41] now is the dispensation of adoption now
[59:47] this is not the dispensation of John the
[59:49] Baptist yet that fulfilled its day and
[59:53] we wouldn't be here hadn't that not come
[59:56] right so he still Hebrews 13:8 now
[1:00:00] listen there's a dispensation without
[1:00:04] pouring of the Holy Spirit that was the
[1:00:06] dispensation of adoption what the
[1:00:10] world's waiting groaning and when the
[1:00:13] fullness of time comes when the
[1:00:15] dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:00:18] what is that fullness of time when the
[1:00:21] Dead rises when sickness ceases when all
[1:00:25] there are ceases to grown the fullness
[1:00:28] of the dispensation of time now he's
[1:00:31] explaining what's going to bring time to
[1:00:35] an end
[1:00:35] well it's just gone quit Mike watch this
[1:00:37] quit it no what is the dispensation when
[1:00:43] it is fulfilled when time is fulfilled
[1:00:48] there was a time for John the Baptist
[1:00:50] that was fulfilled there was the time of
[1:00:51] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost right
[1:00:54] that was fulfilled that doesn't mean the
[1:00:57] Holy Ghost can't fall on us now right
[1:01:00] now saying that it's all in code but now
[1:01:06] is the dispensation of adoption all
[1:01:10] right now then our concern
[1:01:12] should be of adoption to find out about
[1:01:16] adoption that should be our major
[1:01:18] concern if this is the time that that is
[1:01:25] to take place see now how simple of what
[1:01:30] we were talking about this morning Paul
[1:01:32] could understand it and bring it out the
[1:01:34] child born into the family then the
[1:01:37] child to dirt train which as far as Paul
[1:01:41] could go then he steps into bringing his
[1:01:44] message or his thoughts from what he was
[1:01:46] saying and he starts taking it to deeper
[1:01:49] things taking it to the resurrection
[1:01:52] taking it to the change of the body do
[1:01:56] you understand what I mean it's all will
[1:01:58] be involved in it you know what's
[1:02:01] involved you know what a dispensation of
[1:02:02] adoption would be then now listen what
[1:02:09] would be dispensation of adoption and
[1:02:13] you'll see it covers all the way back
[1:02:15] comes all the way down to where we have
[1:02:18] the dispensation of adoption would cover
[1:02:23] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:02:28] of the Holy Ghost the new birth all
[1:02:33] right then the tutoring and the training
[1:02:37] all the way down it would cover the ages
[1:02:41] and their time because they were in the
[1:02:46] dispensation they just didn't have it to
[1:02:49] understand Paul and him understood
[1:02:50] adoption that's my point we looking like
[1:02:54] that well well we don't understand
[1:02:55] adoption that don't mean Paul isn't it
[1:02:57] I'm reading it to you Paul them
[1:03:00] understood adoption Peter explained it
[1:03:04] as the statue of a perfect man Paul
[1:03:07] explains it as adoption and the stages
[1:03:11] and what to be and see thing that's
[1:03:15] where our thoughts should be now on
[1:03:17] adoption well I don't want to know about
[1:03:22] that the dogs you know I just don't
[1:03:23] think that's important
[1:03:25] okay it ain't important enough for you
[1:03:28] to go and change the body that's fine if
[1:03:29] it ain't important enough for the
[1:03:30] resurrection that's fine you won't make
[1:03:32] it anyway
[1:03:34] that blunt the plain enough goes getting
[1:03:39] interesting something you're not gonna
[1:03:40] try let's see the bride should be
[1:03:43] interested we should be concerned about
[1:03:48] what these things are or what it is to
[1:03:51] be these or what they are well you just
[1:03:56] make it to be some kind of a mystery I
[1:03:58] didn't say that your prophet did that it
[1:04:04] was a mystery so let's continue to go on
[1:04:08] the a dispensation of adoption what the
[1:04:15] world's groaning the world
[1:04:23] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[1:04:27] of the sons of God but in the
[1:04:36] dispensation of the fullness of time
[1:04:39] then we'll get to that in on the next
[1:04:41] lesson because when something comes to a
[1:04:44] fullness of times it means it is there
[1:04:47] in manifestation it means it's the dark
[1:04:55] so now what's my point not back not
[1:04:59] forward what's going on now brother
[1:05:04] branham what is this age that we're in
[1:05:06] we're not in the dispensation of John
[1:05:09] the Baptist we're not in the Mosaic law
[1:05:12] dispensation we're not into those
[1:05:14] disciplines that we're not even in the
[1:05:16] dispensation of the outpouring of the
[1:05:18] Holy Spirit that would have come on the
[1:05:20] day of Pentecost and then coming the
[1:05:21] last days to Azusa streets and nothing
[1:05:24] where we at he said we're in the
[1:05:25] dispensation of adoption what the
[1:05:32] world's waiting
[1:05:37] ruining when the time of the fullness of
[1:05:40] time comes when the dispensation of the
[1:05:44] fullness of time what about a church but
[1:05:49] you see we've nearly died it around
[1:05:50] played around and won't won't study the
[1:05:52] message we won't be concerned with the
[1:05:58] message and believing it see you said
[1:06:05] brother tell you we know and you have
[1:06:08] the answer to this you have answer to
[1:06:09] the only answers I have is what that
[1:06:11] prophet said and you come and show me
[1:06:13] where I don't answer the cording to the
[1:06:14] Prophet that's that's where I will just
[1:06:17] sit down right there I'm not bragging
[1:06:19] I'm just telling you what I've tried my
[1:06:21] best to do let me answer you something
[1:06:25] to my own thoughts when all I got to do
[1:06:27] is read the Prophet you have been around
[1:06:32] with brother mogul was here when brother
[1:06:35] moat said brother Brown believed in one
[1:06:37] God he picked up the book and read it
[1:06:39] off the page he was hearing for certain
[1:06:42] what it was that's why I have this I was
[1:06:45] hearing here while back there's certain
[1:06:47] place that the church had started
[1:06:48] putting theirs up it would look praise
[1:06:50] God if that's you know if it's what it
[1:06:52] is we all wanna well cuz that's what I
[1:06:55] believe in
[1:06:55] alright and look what he says that's
[1:06:59] what I said
[1:07:00] you think he covers the dispensation
[1:07:02] let's go to number three try to get a
[1:07:04] point the number three which is
[1:07:07] questions and answers in 57 now the
[1:07:10] Gentiles now what's theirs yet left
[1:07:14] three and a half years into the Jews
[1:07:16] okay and Jesus said to the city of
[1:07:18] Jerusalem will be trodden by the
[1:07:20] Gentiles until the Gentile dispensation
[1:07:23] now you people that don't believe in
[1:07:25] dispensation lets you what about that
[1:07:29] till the Gentile dispensation would be
[1:07:31] finished and when the Gentile
[1:07:33] dispensation is finished the time of the
[1:07:35] Gentiles is finished what are you saying
[1:07:40] what's he doing he's telling you that
[1:07:41] there's a dispensation for all things as
[1:07:47] a dispensation or a time and once that's
[1:07:50] full filled
[1:07:52] and it moves on into something else okay
[1:07:55] going to the next one I like this one
[1:08:04] could I like him all over them tell me
[1:08:08] my brother tell me my sister when was
[1:08:13] the time that the sons of God was ever
[1:08:17] to be manifested outside of this time
[1:08:20] now now what about the Apostle Paul in
[1:08:27] him you don't think they were
[1:08:28] manifestations you don't think he
[1:08:30] thought that you don't think he didn't
[1:08:31] know that what's the difference this is
[1:08:36] the dispensation are the redemption of
[1:08:39] the body this is the time this feller is
[1:08:45] involved not to try to get a new one as
[1:08:49] I said because that's what we were
[1:08:51] taught see don't get me a new body no
[1:08:55] that's not according to scriptures when
[1:08:57] Jesus raised he had nail prints in his
[1:08:59] hands
[1:09:00] that's Bible ingredient and I didn't
[1:09:05] know what said that well good you'll go
[1:09:06] read it that's tricks of the trade what
[1:09:11] to try to get you to read you say well
[1:09:14] brother Dale I don't know whether that's
[1:09:15] right or not we'll go read and
[1:09:16] compromise you know that's what I like
[1:09:19] do that way we can get to a whole thing
[1:09:23] we want to be outside of this time and
[1:09:27] there when were there ever a time in the
[1:09:30] history this that manifests benefits the
[1:09:35] time to deliver all nature nature the
[1:09:39] nature itself is groaning waiting for
[1:09:41] the time of the manifestation one before
[1:09:43] the atonement was made before the Holy
[1:09:46] Ghost was ever poured out before all all
[1:09:49] the Old Testament on down through there
[1:09:51] there couldn't have been manifestation
[1:09:53] now see there couldn't be no baptism
[1:09:55] with the Holy Ghost until the Holy Ghost
[1:09:56] came on the dip in cause it had to wait
[1:09:59] till this time now all things has been
[1:10:02] brought coming down and shaping up to a
[1:10:04] head stir
[1:10:04] to the manifestation of sons of God
[1:10:07] coming back and the Spirit of God coming
[1:10:09] into these men so perfectly until their
[1:10:12] ministry will be so close like Christ
[1:10:14] till it would join him and his shirt
[1:10:17] together all right is that's what it's
[1:10:19] supposed to be it's supposed to be that
[1:10:23] they're supposed to be a group of people
[1:10:26] and I'm not the one I'm just playing
[1:10:29] okay you say brother branham done all
[1:10:31] that now show me where he did when he
[1:10:34] said it would come in these men I'm not
[1:10:37] no argument no argument with nobody
[1:10:40] cause it ain't gonna help nothing it's
[1:10:42] just plain truth I believe he was part
[1:10:46] of that I believe he was one that
[1:10:48] brought the message to you and I rock
[1:10:50] praise God without that him we wouldn't
[1:10:54] be nowhere but if we do sit down you're
[1:11:03] not in the dispensation of adoption did
[1:11:08] you sit down and and peter-patter around
[1:11:10] and play go to church and try to be good
[1:11:13] all that's well and good but Alcoholics
[1:11:17] Anonymous will make you a good person
[1:11:19] right that's their goal is to make you a
[1:11:24] good person it's not my goal to try to
[1:11:27] make you a good person you don't want me
[1:11:30] to be good no kind of stopping pause no
[1:11:35] I don't want you to be good now
[1:11:37] everybody that's been here for ten years
[1:11:38] knows what the answer that is not done
[1:11:42] to the stranger or not I don't want you
[1:11:43] to be a good person I want you to get
[1:11:45] born again that'll take care of the
[1:11:47] whole thing if you get born again it'll
[1:11:50] take care of whether you good or not
[1:11:52] it'll change our whole lives and fit
[1:11:54] together and we'll come out of it with
[1:11:56] the right attitudes and things and be in
[1:11:58] Christ of what he wants us to be because
[1:12:03] it just try to get you to be good for me
[1:12:05] that wasn't no good mm-hmm
[1:12:08] all right but this come on church

[1:12:21] ghost giving far he said what is it he's
[1:12:30] pouring out his spirit he's explaining
[1:12:31] it coming down how the it would be said
[1:12:34] then those who are resting out younger
[1:12:37] in the grave are under the altar of God
[1:12:40] as the scripture says are crying how
[1:12:42] long Lord how long how much longer God's
[1:12:45] waiting on me and you you mean God's
[1:12:55] waiting on me well that's what he said
[1:13:01] you want to race that out God's waiting
[1:13:06] on you and me he's wanting to see what
[1:13:09] we're gonna do what do you think well
[1:13:11] here fifty years after going with the
[1:13:12] Prophet going into war 60 now why cause
[1:13:19] he's trying us he's trying us to see
[1:13:23] what we're gonna do right he's tried to
[1:13:28] give us the tutor the trainer at a time
[1:13:30] and try to give us the nature the
[1:13:32] baptism the whole try to do it now he's
[1:13:34] waiting on you and me wait no it's the
[1:13:39] one look how much longer God's waiting
[1:13:44] on me and you the church is waiting on
[1:13:47] me and you okay the church is waiting on
[1:13:55] me and you adoption time when God can
[1:13:59] pour into us his fullness his power his
[1:14:03] resurrection that when the church in
[1:14:05] Christ becomes so close together till
[1:14:08] Christ becomes visible among us and
[1:14:10] raise the dead and we go in the rapture
[1:14:12] now do you do you believe that never be
[1:14:16] fulfilled I believe it will I've always
[1:14:24] looked for it I believe it will if I
[1:14:26] didn't believe it would I would I really
[1:14:28] be messed up on my dispensation
[1:14:30] what I'd be trying to find out what I
[1:14:32] need to believe I believe God's waiting
[1:14:37] on me and you he's letting this thing
[1:14:40] get bad he's gonna let it get real bad
[1:14:44] because he's waiting to see what we'll
[1:14:46] do
[1:14:47] he sent it to according to scripture two
[1:14:49] tries what should we do well you know
[1:14:59] what in the message what they're doing
[1:15:01] they're running here and they're running
[1:15:02] there and this groups going there and
[1:15:03] that groups going - that's their
[1:15:05] business I'm just saying they're running
[1:15:07] all over the country trying to find
[1:15:08] something instead of just sitting down
[1:15:13] and listen to the message and just leave
[1:15:19] it to the the message has the
[1:15:21] answer to all the time that were waiting
[1:15:26] on us to where God can pour into us his
[1:15:28] fullness brother Branham I didn't say it
[1:15:36] brother Brennan said that the fullness
[1:15:38] of the Godhead bodily would be in the
[1:15:41] bride
[1:15:43] hey now brother Dale that's getting a
[1:15:45] little bit too strong now you trying to
[1:15:47] make us God ain't making us God we are
[1:15:50] God we're the offspring of God were the
[1:15:56] children of God what's the problem well
[1:16:02] you just didn't explain that to start
[1:16:03] with now I got a better idea
[1:16:05] huh what you see what around said to
[1:16:13] Godhead is not complete without you do
[1:16:21] you need those quotes we've given them
[1:16:22] over and over the brothers in the back
[1:16:24] and find them for let's see do we
[1:16:29] believe that we're trying to find a life
[1:16:35] seed come on I'm not against that I'm
[1:16:38] for it

[1:16:41] we send off we go we do all kind of
[1:16:43] things
[1:16:44] to find the last one that we believe in
[1:16:45] it but that ain't what I'm looking for
[1:16:47] because one thing for certain when the
[1:16:51] last one is found according to my
[1:16:54] understanding and I'm hoping for you to
[1:16:57] correctly according to my understanding
[1:16:59] that person must come to maturity line
[1:17:05] you find last person I'll do my best try
[1:17:08] to preach the word to get them to a
[1:17:09] maturity they'll mean I ain't hunting
[1:17:14] them I'm just answering the question you
[1:17:18] find a person we'll do our best to find
[1:17:20] something to teach that person the
[1:17:23] ability cuz we got to come to a place
[1:17:24] because the world's waiting on you and
[1:17:26] me waiting God's trying to place his
[1:17:32] church go ahead number seven
[1:17:36] pull up number seven I get to reading
[1:17:41] over here and I quit enough don't think
[1:17:44] about it's that right waiting God trying
[1:17:50] to place his church in position to
[1:17:52] manifest himself getting one that he can
[1:17:56] work through like this say there is my
[1:17:59] spirit flowing freely there it is that I
[1:18:03] can work here get another one over here
[1:18:05] and place him I can place him adoption
[1:18:09] placing manifesting taking him out of
[1:18:12] here and put a ceremony on him visit him
[1:18:15] with an angel I'm gonna take these back
[1:18:22] up in the next message what's it gonna
[1:18:26] be some quote don't you think that's
[1:18:28] what God done with brother branham don't
[1:18:30] you think he took him out to herself by
[1:18:32] self and visited him with an angel and
[1:18:35] giving the word for you and I well now
[1:18:39] he's bringing it to the individual so
[1:18:41] that's where you think without all that
[1:18:43] ain't okay go ahead
[1:18:44] I can play seaman Dobson placing
[1:18:48] manifest and taking him out here to put
[1:18:50] a ceremony on it visit him with an angel
[1:18:52] tell him something
[1:18:53] now he's told the truth and if he's just
[1:18:56] making you making
[1:18:58] something it won't work no no that that
[1:19:00] won't work
[1:19:01] we've had a lot of that but I mean but I
[1:19:04] mean manifestations of sons of God when
[1:19:08] God manifests himself and he sends him
[1:19:10] out and then he goes forth and what he
[1:19:14] says is truth right listen God sends him
[1:19:24] out
[1:19:25] now what was thought of randoms
[1:19:26] definition of how that Jesus was sent
[1:19:32] are you listening
[1:19:34] the rest of Jesus was sin but what was
[1:19:37] his definition how did he define that
[1:19:40] that took place then he puts it right to
[1:19:46] the church and how does the church sin
[1:19:54] get him quiet you listen you want to
[1:20:00] know what the Prophet had to say he said
[1:20:03] the way God sent him he went in him well
[1:20:09] you just got so bumfuzzled my father on
[1:20:12] what God went in him Jesus and God was a
[1:20:16] self same person are we done messed up
[1:20:17] and the God had somewhere till he seen
[1:20:21] him he went in him he sent the church
[1:20:24] out on the day of Pentecost he went in
[1:20:26] the church those disciples was Christ
[1:20:30] made manifest Paul said it's not either
[1:20:32] living for Christ liveth in me and the
[1:20:34] life that I now live in the flesh I live
[1:20:36] by the faith of son of God God came down
[1:20:39] and went in him how is it right now if
[1:20:43] you got the baptism when the Holy Ghost
[1:20:45] tonight then God came down met with you
[1:20:48] and your soul giving you eternal life
[1:20:50] and sent you because he goes in you
[1:21:01] I think that it makes me understand a
[1:21:03] little bit take them out and visit it
[1:21:14] tell him something profit goes out in
[1:21:22] Arizona and God sent him right Angels
[1:21:26] comes down and watch we got to get it
[1:21:28] real close to understand angels come
[1:21:32] down and visit a prophet this has been
[1:21:36] argued ever since I've been in the
[1:21:37] message of what did they tell him either
[1:21:39] he told you they did not tell him
[1:21:42] nothing he won't that said they told him
[1:21:49] to come back to Jeffersonville and it
[1:21:52] would be told him later what would it be
[1:21:56] God sent to man
[1:21:58] anyone any that's what I look at I look
[1:22:02] at it all to see you know Christ living
[1:22:05] in me and you God waiting to get to
[1:22:07] church in order he's waiting on you and
[1:22:10] I made grant his blessings let's go to
[1:22:19] number nine then we'll get this point
[1:22:26] they said he made known to us the
[1:22:29] mystery and I get the spirit he said own
[1:22:32] you just watch that run-through and I
[1:22:37] got to running he's running his thought
[1:22:39] - I thought mystery how mysterious in
[1:22:44] the scripture packed me back into the
[1:22:46] Old Testament then back over into the
[1:22:49] New Testament taught something together
[1:22:52] see the mystery of his company great the
[1:22:58] mystery of his will the mystery of us
[1:23:02] sitting together remember it cannot be
[1:23:07] taught in any seminary it's a mystery
[1:23:14] you cannot know it by education by
[1:23:18] theology it's a mystery that's been
[1:23:20] hidden since the foundation of the world
[1:23:25] or you read waiting for the
[1:23:29] manifestation of the sons of God the
[1:23:33] word manifest look it up and get home
[1:23:34] see what lean manifest means to make
[1:23:37] known look it up he needs to make known
[1:23:43] because that's what God wants he wants
[1:23:45] it to be make known he wants himself to
[1:23:47] me be known it's a mystery
[1:23:50] the mystery is to adopt us there's going
[1:23:54] to be a people that will come to fulfill
[1:24:00] in their dispensation all things
[1:24:04] pertaining to adoption and the last of
[1:24:07] all is the redemption of these bodies
[1:24:10] what are you looking forward to brother
[1:24:12] Dale I'm looking forward to the
[1:24:14] redemption of these bodies they said
[1:24:18] when will this take place I've got them
[1:24:20] here he said in the resurrection waiting
[1:24:28] on a people that can understand
[1:24:34] now we're gonna tap something and then
[1:24:36] back up okay the headstone has not come
[1:24:40] yet that's what your prophet says all
[1:24:45] right
[1:24:46] now I've taught you deny believe it what
[1:24:50] is the headstone to the church the fully
[1:24:53] revealed Word of God which is the
[1:24:56] opening of those seven seals that
[1:25:01] prophet went west came back east the
[1:25:05] angels met him daily and he brought the
[1:25:07] seals there was the headstone to the
[1:25:10] church but one you won't read Greer's
[1:25:15] Almanac I read this book of that book of
[1:25:17] study all these other time when it's
[1:25:19] been told to you your very headstone is
[1:25:21] the Word of God and then you don't want
[1:25:23] to read it or you won't read it you
[1:25:25] won't take your time
[1:25:33] at least oh brother I out here call me
[1:25:35] up sometime I'll be on something like I
[1:25:36] said what should I read I said we'll
[1:25:40] read this this is this cuz that's kind
[1:25:42] of where my thinking is that well it's a
[1:25:50] mystery God's mystery is that he's going
[1:25:54] to redeem us do you listening this early
[1:25:58] the mystery of God in the last days is
[1:26:01] the fact that he's going to redeem a
[1:26:04] people he's not going to give us a new
[1:26:07] body it's not going to go through things
[1:26:09] like that it's going to be a Redemption
[1:26:11] and the world is waiting on you and I to
[1:26:17] manifest our make that known the Prophet
[1:26:26] made it known he brought us the word
[1:26:30] we're not looking for another messenger
[1:26:32] to come somewhere we're in the
[1:26:43] dispensation now listen to what I'm
[1:26:48] talking about that dispensation I'm
[1:26:51] gonna state it the best way I can for
[1:26:53] our understanding when the Prophet began
[1:26:56] to bring the word about adoption there
[1:26:58] was the beginning of the mystery of
[1:27:00] adoption when he begin to bring it out
[1:27:03] cause nobody brought it out before oh
[1:27:05] yeah they spoke about this or spoke
[1:27:07] about that like I said we spoke with
[1:27:08] some of these things but when he began
[1:27:12] to say what did he say one day he said
[1:27:17] when you begin to say I and my father
[1:27:20] are one and these other things he said
[1:27:24] them and denominations will swing
[1:27:26] together well we've always looked for
[1:27:28] the denomination to swim together why
[1:27:30] don't we start saying I and my father
[1:27:32] one
[1:27:35] that's what the Prophet said yeah but we
[1:27:40] can't do it we can't do that until he
[1:27:41] gives it to us uh-huh
[1:27:43] ain't foolish sure but I am one time
[1:27:47] this message when it began to open to
[1:27:50] the Prophet you started a dispensation
[1:27:52] of adoption he was back there in 55 and
[1:27:57] earlier talking about adoption the
[1:28:00] biggest portion of his message is Jiri
[1:28:02] him and things was back in the 50s he
[1:28:07] began to try to explain that and he said
[1:28:09] that's where you Pentecostals failed see
[1:28:12] they think about not listening to him as
[1:28:14] to what he was explaining that you must
[1:28:16] come to manifestation you must come to
[1:28:19] adoption you must come really instead of
[1:28:21] thinking you got it all and that's why I
[1:28:24] warn every year you and all of us never
[1:28:28] become the relaxed in Zion yeah
[1:28:33] always be concerned and worried and and
[1:28:36] looking forward I look forward he stay I
[1:28:41] like what Billy Graham said he said
[1:28:45] Athena I look for him today or something
[1:28:47] of my perforation wrong pretty close he
[1:28:50] said if he don't come today Cynthia
[1:28:51] boned tomorrow he's a good I look for
[1:28:56] what do we look for
[1:29:05] we're waiting for the fullness of
[1:29:07] adoption this will take place when
[1:29:12] that's a prophecy in it at the first
[1:29:17] resurrection when will this take place
[1:29:26] at the first resurrection we're watching
[1:29:30] for the fullness waiting for the
[1:29:32] fullness reduction this will take place
[1:29:33] when the first resurrection that's when
[1:29:36] our bodies will be changed from these
[1:29:37] vile creatures that we are we'll have a
[1:29:40] body like unto his glorious body we'll
[1:29:42] see him as the years why called we be
[1:29:44] like him
[1:29:45] when he appears we appear in his
[1:29:46] likeness we will have a body like he is
[1:29:48] a glorious purified body and all the
[1:29:50] trials and struggles of life will fade
[1:29:52] off into a little mist and blow away to
[1:29:54] never be no more in these earthly
[1:29:56] Tabernacles which we now grown in we're
[1:29:59] waiting for the earnest that earnest
[1:30:01] for the salvation fully in its fullness
[1:30:04] in fullness to come but now in these
[1:30:08] Tabernacles will play we have something
[1:30:10] that tells us that we have raised up so
[1:30:13] far amen now you get the last point
[1:30:20] something has happened
[1:30:22] if you have the new birth something has
[1:30:26] happened to tell you what's going on if
[1:30:31] you're listening we're in the days of
[1:30:34] the manifestation of the sons and
[1:30:36] daughters of the Living God what are we
[1:30:40] waiting on the Bible said he's waiting
[1:30:43] on us it doesn't say we're waiting on
[1:30:44] him right are we waiting on God oh yeah
[1:30:51] we're right no need to manifest this and
[1:30:52] that nature we're waiting on it that way
[1:30:54] but really he's waiting on us do you
[1:31:02] realize what that means

[1:33:37] long the man would have been buried and
[1:33:40] I could have still been hollering and
[1:33:42] screaming I stood in a hospital one day
[1:33:48] and looked out a window I was hired to

[1:34:31] times later the husband would come into
[1:34:33] a situation there and was on death bed
[1:34:36] and she was called me as God told you
[1:34:38] that I said no I told you okay but I
[1:34:41] said I've got to say that by His stripes
[1:34:43] he's healed by the stripes of God he's
[1:34:46] healed and he's gonna live I've got to
[1:34:48] say that until the day comes that you
[1:34:50] called me and tell me that then he's
[1:34:51] already dead
[1:34:52] I said I can't say nothing else she said
[1:34:55] couldn't we pray for him to go ahead and
[1:34:56] die I said no because he was in sick
[1:35:01] start with you know horrible shape so
[1:35:03] wouldn't it be humane I said no but I
[1:35:08] said when you call me and tell me he's
[1:35:09] dead I'll tell the world he dead she
[1:35:10] called me one day and only
[1:35:17] listen Church why can't we just take
[1:35:21] what we see and speak it and we won't
[1:35:30] sure Richard the family they wanted me
[1:35:34] to go and pray for their daddy I wanted
[1:35:37] to do but when I got there I couldn't
[1:35:41] find nothing I prayed I couldn't find
[1:35:48] that oh I could pray sure and I can

[1:36:16] know about it he's been that way for
[1:36:18] years a few years with his rods right
[1:36:20] side he couldn't move we stood and
[1:36:24] looked at him and prayed and talked and
[1:36:26] I said Lord wouldn't it be something
[1:36:27] that he just come out of this and that
[1:36:33] other side start working he saw no he
[1:36:40] just heating they'd rather come on your
