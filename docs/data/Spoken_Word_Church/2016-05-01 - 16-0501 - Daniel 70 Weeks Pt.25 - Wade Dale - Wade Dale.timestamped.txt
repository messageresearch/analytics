[1:36] gonna be a mama okay anyway so didn't
[1:42] have everybody in with us today and
[1:44] we're doing a study on Daniel 70 weeks
[1:47] this is part number 25 so we have been
[1:52] we have been looking at the dates and
[1:55] the times all right now we know one
[1:59] thing's for sure that the day of 70
[2:02] weeks according to Daniel 9 24 to 27 is
[2:07] Jewish so what we are doing is we're
[2:11] looking at it through a Jewish
[2:12] perspective because it's not too loo
[2:15] it's not to the Gentile you got you a
[2:17] little chart that we've drawn all kind
[2:19] of charge and we have the one you
[2:20] brother Brown drew it's a tabernacle but
[2:23] we are now I'm sorry about the driver
[2:26] that we're doing this in you coming in
[2:29] at number 25 but and it may be some
[2:31] questions but that's okay so this is the
[2:33] last week we believe in this church that
[2:35] there's one week left after the Raptor
[2:37] according to the Bible and accordingly
[2:38] problems message we proved it hey me
[2:43] right in we cleaned it okay so not not
[2:48] three and a half years left after the
[2:49] rapture Liz one week left according to
[2:52] the prophets message and according to
[2:54] the bottle more importantly according to
[2:58] the Bible
[3:00] I brother ground said face final resting
[3:02] places in the Word of God he can't say
[3:05] anything outside the Word of God raised
[3:07] already know word prophet but they
[3:09] didn't work probably believe that so now
[3:12] we're on the last week after the Raptors
[3:15] took place here's the sample church age
[3:18] church age is over we took a raptor and
[3:22] now we've come into this last week our
[3:25] last seven years and we show showed last
[3:30] Sunday how we got to that because it
[3:33] will remember going back to the very
[3:38] beginning and in the Dinah 70 weeks book
[3:41] we showed according even to history
[3:43] according to Nehemiah the damn 70 weeks
[3:47] began in 445 bc there was an edit or a
[3:50] contract given to kneel my to finish
[3:53] everything there was an edit given to
[3:56] Ezra he didn't finish it there was an
[3:59] edit given through Darius and Cyrus they
[4:03] in finish it but when certain exert sees
[4:05] gave the commandment or the edict to
[4:10] Nehemiah Nehemiah win finish the walls
[4:13] in 52 days towards about you reading the
[4:16] amounts with two they have trial in one
[4:19] hand and sorting the other man all right
[4:21] according to near life they finished in
[4:26] 52 days in 4 45 be seen so that was our
[4:30] mark as far as when the 70 weeks begin
[4:34] right now if you find out what something
[4:38] begins you ought to be able to find out
[4:40] when something ends if it's got the
[4:42] exact times all right this guy in the
[4:46] exact time they get what they get 400
[4:49] years for redemption of Israel 70 a
[4:51] week's seventy times seven is how much
[4:57] thank you we've been through this all
[4:59] before five hundred and ninety years and
[5:02] we showed through the prophets messaging
[5:04] through the Bible that 483 of those
[5:06] years have already been completed at the
[5:11] cross and after sixty two weeks of my
[5:15] side will be cut off we've got that okay
[5:17] everybody's got that one we have a
[5:19] little cross right there right here you
[5:21] should have on your chart for 45 bc
[5:23] that's the beginning of the seventy
[5:25] weeks of Daniel all right then there was
[5:29] a according to the Prophet going to the
[5:32] Bible there's three periods a 49-year
[5:36] 434 year and seven year that adds up for
[5:42] our night all right all right that's
[5:46] dummy simple additions because it says
[5:49] seventy weeks are determined so there's
[5:50] only going to be a certain amount of
[5:52] time for shoes for the round said don't
[5:54] worry about the Gentile we have no time
[5:57] revelations 10 6 or 5 at the angle touch
[6:01] the ground he raised his hands of heaven
[6:02] and he said calm should be no longer a
[6:06] man they say my angel in Daniel stood
[6:10] one foot on land on one foot on C raises
[6:12] hand said it'd be great time times and
[6:15] the dividing of time what's time what's
[6:19] it do what's times what's a dividing of
[6:22] time grant I have here all right so you
[6:26] got that so they get a specific time and
[6:30] brother Brown said watch the Jews there
[6:32] the timepiece and we already been
[6:34] through that so we can put time in here
[6:37] right we're just reviewing from weeks of
[6:40] study now we've come to where we've got
[6:44] a marker of 445 bc and then we know that
[6:48] brother branham according to the quotes
[6:50] we were in last Sunday Jesus rode into
[6:54] Jerusalem on Palm Sunday April the
[6:57] second 8030 right okay now you'll see
[7:02] we'll look he's just like right here now
[7:05] not saying a Prophet's wrong but that
[7:07] looks fit he was thinking
[7:09] that Jesus was 33 years old that's what
[7:11] I'm saying because 1833 doesn't fit 8030
[7:15] exactly fits the 483 years right he said
[7:19] well then he changing the seal no we
[7:20] went back to the steelbook remember last
[7:22] time they will head back to the sixth
[7:24] seal and brother Ronald said Matthew 24
[7:26] was preached in the afternoon of April
[7:31] the fourth 8033 was killed all right so
[7:35] then I got that so we have another
[7:37] marker we have 4 45 bc we have a t30
[7:41] right right that's what we were doing
[7:43] last Sunday we were putting these dates
[7:45] in the markers these are markers of time
[7:49] okay now then we have a ton of the
[7:52] Gentiles we went through that last
[7:55] Sunday all right and then we're going to
[7:57] look at another time here because
[7:59] somebody had joined us to go over it
[8:01] again we're going to Gore it again this
[8:03] girl mark here is still in the Gentile
[8:05] time but brother around talked about
[8:08] here 1977 okay all right he made eight
[8:14] he made a statement about 1977 we're
[8:17] going to read it here in a minute and
[8:18] we'll go over it again that's how we're
[8:20] going to rehearse it just one more time
[8:22] because if we can tell when 70 weeks
[8:25] begins when we can tell when the 70
[8:28] weeks ends all you guys do is back it up
[8:32] seven years you said what are you seven
[8:34] days do you say what you want to brother
[8:37] Brown said you could know the year and
[8:39] the week but nobody knows to bear the
[8:42] album all right so maybe we can get
[8:44] pretty close all right that's what he
[8:47] said to dance and weeks but he's trying
[8:48] to find out Daniel was trying to find
[8:51] out how long it was for they were going
[8:53] to go out of Israel he said we're trying
[8:55] to find out how long it is for us to get
[8:57] out here right because ninety seven
[9:00] weeks is truly to the Jews but have a
[9:02] spiritual meaning problem because it's
[9:04] the redemption of Israel if the six fold
[9:07] purpose redeemed Israel right now
[9:09] I'm 24 it took six purposes finish the
[9:13] transgression in the sand reconciliation
[9:15] for iniquity bring everlasting
[9:16] righteousness still at the vision and
[9:18] prophecy or North the most holy there
[9:20] six thing that's going to redeem Israel
[9:23] and the city because it's 2-2 things now
[9:25] see we don't have a continuance city
[9:27] right we don't have a city and then turn
[9:29] it on we have a city right so we're not
[9:35] looking for a city but the Jews are
[9:36] looking for a city temple worship all
[9:39] the things all right that's what they're
[9:40] used to that's their that's their deal
[9:42] so that's what that like Ron Brown says
[9:46] here in the day I'm staying 2 weeks book
[9:47] he said Ezekiel 42 44 was the building
[9:50] of the millennium temple so there will
[9:52] be on millennium temple because Jesus
[9:54] has the son of David is going to sit on
[9:56] the throne judging the twelve tribes of
[9:59] Israel in the Millennium because
[10:01] remember the Millennium to us is just a
[10:02] honeymoon but it's a jubilee year for
[10:05] the Jews right if the Jubilee from the
[10:08] Jews according to 12 prophet said all
[10:10] right and according to the Bible so what
[10:12] we did is that we took 4 45 bc 8030 1977
[10:19] now we're going to read maybe not this
[10:23] sunny but next sunday we're going to
[10:25] read all the times that we're brother on
[10:27] said there's one week left after the
[10:28] rapture right he never changed that he
[10:32] never changed that you just didn't
[10:34] understand what he was talking about
[10:35] same way where 1977 brother trevor if he
[10:38] says something about 1977 and the
[10:40] rapture getting clipped a place in 1977
[10:42] either he was wrong are we misunderstood
[10:46] what he said because profits are very
[10:50] misunderstood right but now the real
[10:53] profit is never misunderstood you don't
[10:56] know if I'm at all and then you know bad
[10:58] versus good i'm at the holy ghost is the
[11:00] prophet of every eight it's the Prophet
[11:03] just a holy dove you all right because
[11:06] watch now look that's where we're at
[11:09] right now if we were prob about nineteen
[11:10] seventy-seven because something did
[11:12] happen in 1977
[11:16] God made a promise but watch let's get
[11:18] right hand they rejected Christ that was
[11:24] an 830 he turned to the Gentiles and
[11:25] taking people for his name now counting
[11:28] the time we find the way of exactly 17
[11:30] years left we will have the same span of
[11:32] time given to us as God dealing with us
[11:36] in the power of the holy spirit since
[11:37] 8030 until nineteen seventy-seven
[11:40] because it doesn't fit put 33 of them
[11:42] the same span of time 1954 years God
[11:46] deals with us the same as he did with
[11:48] the Jews because remember the property
[11:50] guy told us things six seals finishes
[11:52] our Redemption Sabbath this Christ come
[11:55] on the same but six seals finishes the
[11:57] redemption of us all right what he said
[12:01] I believe that they can go through the
[12:02] sealed and you can show the redemption
[12:03] of man us Gentiles through those six
[12:07] there those six seals also through the
[12:09] six full purpose town funny constrained
[12:11] that they six seals finishes our
[12:13] redemption in 64 purpose finishes Israel
[12:17] for them show right it's not funny it's
[12:20] exactly what God put in there because
[12:21] remember guys got a mark and we've
[12:24] arrived on that mark okay now he said no
[12:27] watch seinfeld time nothing on vid for
[12:30] years now marked down your book he must
[12:35] have thought it was important mark down
[12:37] your book a little scripture here i want
[12:39] to give you know better kiss 25
[12:40] beginning with the a verb now we went
[12:44] back a little bit at this 25 08 last
[12:45] Sunday and he'll read it right here as
[12:48] we go on nothing now remember he's
[12:52] already made a statement of 1977
[12:54] everybody got that run all right now we
[12:58] understand from the first you believe
[13:00] first jubilee of Leviticus 25 8 now if
[13:04] you'll go a little bit at this 25 8 it
[13:06] says you how old the Sabbath every seven
[13:09] Sabbath you have a jubilee we're readin
[13:13] amenities he's got down there where you
[13:15] read it it's right on down here a little
[13:16] bit
[13:18] but we're reading a minute but no watch
[13:22] we understand from the first Jubilee of
[13:25] Leviticus 25 8 in 1977 will be the 70th
[13:29] Jubilee what is seventy times seven Wow
[13:39] after 25 times we go to buy rock 490 got
[13:46] it yeah red lip hear something so anyway
[13:50] so from the first you believe that God
[13:52] give the Jews to the 70th Jubilee
[13:58] there's no 71st or you got 500 anyway
[14:05] put your over at 49 more years that you
[14:07] can you only have 70 weeks determine you
[14:10] only have four ninety years determined
[14:12] you only got 70 jubilate now from the
[14:16] first Jubilee of Leviticus 25 a in 1977
[14:20] will be the 70th Cuba late 70s you
[14:25] believe I got that right making exactly
[14:30] 3000th 130 years Jubilee means to going
[14:33] up the release and any same that we're
[14:35] watching for the coming of glam metal
[14:36] glam they did you get that car guess and
[14:38] says a man well god is dealt with us
[14:42] exactly the same amount of time he dealt
[14:44] with the Jews from the time together has
[14:45] a promise to the rejection of them aside
[14:46] a t30 was 1954 years now we have 17
[14:51] years left we had about nineteen hundred
[14:53] and thirty something years we got 17
[14:56] years left of 77 will be the 70th
[14:59] Jubilee okay 1977 will be the 70th
[15:04] Jubilee since the beginning of Jubilees
[15:07] and what will it be okay guy watch close
[15:14] now don't miss it it will be the Jubilee
[15:17] of the going up of the Gentile bride I
[15:19] see that's where everybody thought I hey
[15:21] I almost caught I wish I was 17 years
[15:23] old in 1977 we
[15:24] in the message this church was founded
[15:26] in nineteen seventy one so a lot of the
[15:29] old ones thought 77 was going to be the
[15:31] rapture 99% of them but that 99% about
[15:36] fifty percent of that man i'm presenting
[15:37] don't believe the message no more cuz in
[15:39] 77 they send all their books back to
[15:41] jeffersonville in quick the message come
[15:42] let's have another round was wrong we
[15:44] never said it was the rapture he said
[15:48] was to going up with the Gentile Church
[15:50] yeah what is it going up it was all that
[15:53] old Pentecostal idea of going to land
[15:55] all coming us coming into the real age
[15:57] that brother branham preached which is
[16:00] the son ma'am ministry going on to
[16:02] perfection going up the statute perfect
[16:05] man it's not the neil I ok did you you
[16:09] say well what you want them but he lied
[16:11] if he said derive from 77 it didn't
[16:13] happen he didn't but we know what
[16:15] happened got 17 years left of 77 will be
[16:19] 270 of Jubilee since the beginning of
[16:22] Jubilees what would be old brother watch
[16:24] close don't miss it because you believe
[16:25] is going up Gentile bride and the return
[16:28] of Christ to the Jews but now watch what
[16:30] he said he continued when they go out of
[16:33] bondage now they will not go out of bond
[16:37] there under bondage right now right all
[16:39] right they can't get the Holy Ghost
[16:42] 144,000 cogito else while we're still
[16:44] here they're still under money but when
[16:46] we go up God comes back to deal with the
[16:49] bright the Gentile I'm in the sorry the
[16:51] Jewish 144,000 they go out of bondage
[16:56] when those two prophets preached at 1260
[16:58] days are their Redemption than alright
[17:03] you explaining the other way don't you
[17:06] see from all the world and get it there
[17:07] for that day on I see we're at we don't
[17:10] know what time that might happen we're
[17:12] at the end time now he talks about the
[17:14] old-timers and in 1933 he dedicated the
[17:18] church and all that he predict remember
[17:22] he did prophesied he was predicting
[17:25] talks about all the four or five six
[17:28] things
[17:30] woman's nation come up the paper 1933 in
[17:38] 1977 and then breaking to the seals you
[17:42] see what all that comes from I tell you
[17:45] what let's do let's go ahead and read us
[17:47] to the planet let's read it it's in here
[17:48] somewhere but I'm bet on before that so
[17:56] let's go the bed is 25 8 we'll just do
[17:58] that run their last a little bit of his
[18:02] 25 8 and we're reading he said now
[18:04] according to Leviticus 25 8 though he's
[18:08] headed he is that corny Leviticus 25 10
[18:12] the biggest 25 10 is the 50th jubilee
[18:15] but Leviticus 25 8 is showing what the
[18:21] 49s right okay Leviticus 25 verse 8 and
[18:30] thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[18:33] years into the seven times seven years
[18:36] for seven times seven don't know if not
[18:40] for 97 look we're inside working thank
[18:44] you 7 times 7 is 49 because the Bible
[18:47] tells you right here it adds it up for
[18:49] you and the space of the seven sabbaths
[18:51] of your Shelby until age 40 and nine
[18:54] years 49 years 77 because remember we're
[19:02] still in a 77 we're still in the 49 we
[19:07] are we have got our 50th jubilee right
[19:11] but they're still in there waiting for
[19:13] their time the Millennium all right all
[19:16] right okay
[19:18] oh that's right our family is all I got
[19:21] that's why that the Pentecost is main
[19:23] penta is 5550 that's when the Holy Ghost
[19:26] fell from the Gentiles but he had fell
[19:28] on them yet that felony Jews yet or the
[19:32] vermin I say the Jews done imported for
[19:33] talent but he got any specific Holy
[19:35] Ghost can't fall on you that's right you
[19:38] can't accept the message of the hour but
[19:39] i'll go up to 144,000 that's in the
[19:42] Bible alright so now you shall number
[19:46] seven styles now this is the Crypt r you
[19:47] went to but now watch if he would have
[19:50] went to Leviticus 25 10 you shall
[19:53] hallowed the fiftieth year now that 50th
[19:55] year is the Jubilee year right now as we
[20:03] saw before watch this we've already been
[20:07] good before but just just 77 649 right
[20:13] all right that's the church ages okay
[20:17] that's still in the church a full seven
[20:18] 7 945 but now remember your 50th year
[20:22] was not 123456 Emmett 1949-50 remember
[20:28] it's the first year of the next forty
[20:31] nine years on there is no 50th year your
[20:35] 50th year is the first year of the next
[20:38] forty nine right now we know that
[20:40] according to the Jews they take you to
[20:42] tell you that okay so it's not that we
[20:45] have 49 50 and then one right it's 49
[20:50] they kept up with it remember they get
[20:55] on the housetop they see the next did
[20:56] see the Sun coming up well that was the
[20:58] first year of the next forty nine years
[21:00] side plate wasn't a 50 year okay so now
[21:04] if I got that no no we all we've been
[21:06] through that a lot itself alright so now
[21:12] according a little bit at this 25-8
[21:15] brother Brandon goes to the business 25
[21:17] 8 7 times 7 is 49 alright so now
[21:23] but the few days it is that I want you
[21:26] to understand is that if we can find the
[21:29] beginning we ought to be able to find
[21:31] the ending right until nineteen
[21:35] seventy-seven was a marker year
[21:38] something happened prophet said it
[21:41] several several times okay but it wasn't
[21:44] the rapture was it going up it was there
[21:47] was a marker there and what I contend is
[21:51] its windows it's when God quit linking
[21:54] it to ignorance of the Pentecostal
[21:55] people and began a jubilee for the
[22:00] Gentile bride that's what I say because
[22:04] before 1977 everybody looked a 1977 if I
[22:07] look to brother Brown coming back
[22:09] everybody look to this and look to that
[22:11] but after 77 they must have known
[22:14] something was there was two things
[22:15] easily brother hammers rider he was
[22:17] wrong and the one that thought knew he
[22:19] was right knew that they had to dig
[22:21] deeper to find out what he said running
[22:24] the ones that didn't care did hair start
[22:26] with let me just be honest with you mean
[22:29] it's not this everything I'm talking
[22:31] them well it meant something so if he
[22:34] goes to Leviticus 25 8 which is 49 years
[22:38] because remember you can't have a 71st
[22:41] Jubilee the next giveaway started after
[22:45] that 49th year the next year would have
[22:48] been would be a 71st Jubilee right 1977
[22:53] was the 70th Jubilee so God's give us 49
[22:57] years to get it right now but because
[23:06] remember 1977 he puts it in the Danish
[23:09] him doing theory for a reason recently
[23:13] it give Atlanta
[23:17] 7 7 is 49 not 50 49 got it all right 49
[23:24] so add forty nine to nineteen
[23:26] seventy-seven and you got the Year 2026
[23:30] now you so well what's going on here
[23:33] well let me just give me two things
[23:36] number one brother Dale in 1974 preached
[23:38] his same thing in 1974 he proved we
[23:41] could go to 20 26 and not break what
[23:44] brother Ron said well there was I
[23:46] thought he was an idiot honestly they
[23:47] did till they said no 77 is it well are
[23:51] we still here we still here we're still
[23:55] here this is 2016 that's only 10 years
[23:58] from that year right there yeah but you
[24:02] got to remember that ends the seventy
[24:04] weeks of Daniel we're not we're not here
[24:07] when that in if you got one week left
[24:14] you got to back it up seven years cuz we
[24:17] go on the rapture seven years before
[24:18] nine seventy weeks in right so then it's
[24:25] like I said before I was online looking
[24:26] online at some of the other commentaries
[24:28] because i was reading this morning where
[24:31] brother branham looked at Glamis larkin
[24:33] you're on smith several others and he
[24:37] thanked them and i believe he did I
[24:39] believe brother Brennan was a studied
[24:41] man he didn't just and don't get me
[24:43] wrong he got d revelation from God and
[24:46] man he got the revelation from God but
[24:49] that angel would come down and tell him
[24:51] what scriptures to look for when I
[24:53] brother branham wedding just grabbed his
[24:54] Bible and go ride and start preaching he
[24:57] studied he said I studying all day went
[25:00] from Scripture the spectrum I didn't
[25:03] hurt that angles feelings me and you
[25:04] would probably hurt our feelings we come
[25:06] in and say William random I'm a problem
[25:07] to angel from God you need to go preach
[25:10] this no you can't do that that angel
[25:13] could not give william branham a
[25:14] revelation right that angel wasn't his
[25:18] holy go
[25:18] right all right William Brown had a holy
[25:22] ghost inside of it was Jesus Christ and
[25:25] when you brought it when that angel
[25:27] brought him the word the word took it in
[25:31] till the word that William Brown head
[25:33] inside of him and then he went compared
[25:35] it to the scripture because he he
[25:36] couldn't compare it that's like I said
[25:38] many times before look at Paul and Peter
[25:40] and some of them didn't have a Bible to
[25:42] go by they have a quote book and go by
[25:45] sure Paul had the Old Testament but it
[25:47] was the old custom he had to bring it to
[25:50] the New Testament so by the Holy go to
[25:51] filter logos he brought the Old
[25:53] Testament and brought it into the New
[25:54] Testament and said you'll be judged by
[25:56] my gospel and nobody will be judged by
[25:57] way around us right I believe will be
[26:01] judged by one brother Brown said the man
[26:03] this whole world would be judged by what
[26:05] we friend said so excuse me but that's
[26:08] what I contend is that but when I
[26:10] started looking and it was my whole
[26:12] pretense I was looking online at lunar
[26:15] cycles and because brother Brennan
[26:18] always brings a 30 day cycle in and
[26:20] remember we went through this this was
[26:21] back about number four where we showed
[26:25] that this is the Jewish calendar but you
[26:28] guys study this by Jewish you got to
[26:31] have a Jewish mentality but forever to
[26:33] really understand that instead into
[26:35] eight because it's not to us literally
[26:38] but spiritually it is to it but this is
[26:41] their calendar and it starts in the
[26:43] spring God told them their first month
[26:45] was missing all right start your year
[26:49] here on the fourteenth day of nisin what
[26:53] I'm asking the phone on a fourteenth day
[26:57] of nisin is the Passover on the
[27:01] fifteenth day is unleavened bread on
[27:03] seventeenth days first fruit 50 days
[27:06] later spent off oh my god that this is a
[27:09] Jewish this is the Jewish lunar calendar
[27:12] now the civil calendar starts over here
[27:15] for them so don't get confused their
[27:18] civil calendar starts in our October but
[27:23] their religious calendar starts when
[27:24] Gothel
[27:25] start the first month of your year go
[27:27] back to Genesis I believe the woman was
[27:31] Noah came out of the ark or even notice
[27:33] when Moses was leaving in two pieces you
[27:35] hallowed this month right this month is
[27:38] the first year for you first month of
[27:41] the year for you which is missing hey
[27:44] nobody got there then we know one
[27:46] thing's for sure Jesus fulfilled the
[27:50] first four feast while he was here on
[27:53] her now remember they were having these
[27:55] feast days and he would show up at
[27:56] everyone else it was the word he had to
[28:00] show I am the bread of life he was there
[28:03] one 911 when they were doing the
[28:04] unleavened bread and he said I am the
[28:06] bread of life why they kicked him out of
[28:08] church but remember he was the Passover
[28:12] lamb so he fulfilled this when he was
[28:14] killed we weren't been through this so
[28:15] I'm going we're gonna go through it
[28:17] again so I said this is important the
[28:19] Passover is on this and 14 ok our 14
[28:24] days after the first now remember this
[28:28] all go by it goes by with moons if
[28:30] you'll read your little thing down here
[28:31] at the bottom if the new moon is not
[28:33] visible on this last day of eight are 29
[28:37] they added another month the reason they
[28:41] added another month bro trevor was it
[28:43] kept these feast days kept coming around
[28:45] to the summertime that's like our leap
[28:48] year you to have elite you got to back
[28:49] it up so they backed it up by having
[28:52] another 30 day period to a year so some
[28:55] of their here's had 13 months ok so now
[29:00] so he fulfil Passover he was killed and
[29:04] Passover remember they had to get him
[29:06] off the cross because the next day was a
[29:08] Sabbath they wasn't going to leave him
[29:10] up there so they that was Passover
[29:12] unleavened bread was when he was in in
[29:14] the earth firstfruits of land
[29:17] resurrected
[29:21] right and then 50 days later he came
[29:24] back on the day of Pentecost in the
[29:26] bleeders so he fulfilled all for these
[29:29] feast but he hasn't fulfilled leave to
[29:32] the Jews right right but he's fulfilled
[29:39] all these four hours we've got all these
[29:41] speeds days I mean we are brother
[29:43] bramson we're feasting under the Feast
[29:44] of Tabernacles right here right God
[29:46] Tabernacle in human flesh that's what he
[29:48] wanted to do with Israel but they turned
[29:50] him down all right so we got Feast of
[29:53] Trumpets Day of Atonement Feast of
[29:55] Tabernacles and at least the dedication
[29:56] which is hanukkah yet to fulfill so now
[30:02] I was looking at this day kept coming up
[30:07] on the internet and I wondered one and
[30:11] there were several people doing studies
[30:13] of the same thing listen these people
[30:16] that I'm sorry there's people in a
[30:18] denominational world that's got more
[30:19] revelation about dating 70 weeks than
[30:21] ninety percent of people miss messaging
[30:24] we had masters meeting several years ago
[30:28] and one preacher like to knock this
[30:30] ceiling down his righteous indignation
[30:32] gotta just put it that way but he was
[30:36] dead wrong right there he's wrong I
[30:41] don't care safely wrong Brown program
[30:44] said I wish the day that we stand up and
[30:47] say you know Samuel foster so I told him
[30:49] they would say my brother grunting all
[30:51] right I really don't care meet you
[30:54] though now I don't lose no sleep over
[30:56] that I really don't write cuz truth is
[30:58] truth then when you know true they've
[31:00] set you free I mean you don't worry
[31:01] about this thing okay
[31:03] anyways I don't have to worry about it
[31:04] anymore even more now than them than
[31:06] than before but the Year 2026 kept
[31:09] coming up so this guy did a study he
[31:12] went back to NASA and took all the moon
[31:14] stop was from way back so snacks that
[31:17] goes by that NASA don't go by are 365 in
[31:20] the 4th calendar Dave they have to get
[31:22] them stars lined up the moon lined up
[31:24] and everything to shoot a rocket so they
[31:27] go by the moon all the moon phases and
[31:29] all those things so this guy brought the
[31:31] lunar table down and now remember if we
[31:36] got one week left after the rapture
[31:38] that's 20 520 lunar days everybody got
[31:43] that this is where we didn't cover this
[31:46] much last Sunday 2520 days is 1216
[31:52] remember in Daniel 9 27 the prince will
[31:55] make a covenant for one week and he
[31:57] shall make a covenant not Jesus the
[32:00] Antichrist will make a covenant with
[32:01] many for one week and in the midst of
[32:05] that week he'll because that he will
[32:07] come in and say the sacrifice is going
[32:08] to be finished alright so now so if you
[32:12] got 1260 days and 1260 days that makes
[32:15] 2520 days okay right now this guy's and
[32:21] it was really good we brought it in
[32:22] because he showed that 2014 2016 and
[32:30] 2019 is the only 33 years that if you
[32:36] add seven years to it it comes with that
[32:39] day I mean after that date but you had
[32:42] seven years to finish the stem and you
[32:43] finish the one the 2520 day cycle he
[32:47] called the so it's kind of
[32:49] strange that you got you put these two
[32:51] together you got seven years not this
[32:54] one that's this year that one we know it
[32:57] didn't happen but there's only one year
[32:59] left that fits the 2520 lunar cycles to
[33:03] make exactly seven years to the end of
[33:07] the 70 weeks and a okay
[33:10] then it's just something that you own a
[33:13] little while if you bring it back to
[33:17] that wind when the Antichrist walks into
[33:20] this temple right here and he desecrates
[33:23] the temple right at the Bible Daniel 9
[33:27] 27 he shall bring that coming in the
[33:30] middle of the week when he breaks that
[33:33] covenant he has desecrated the temple
[33:35] but what is he doing he's going to walk
[33:37] into the temple and say I am I am the
[33:41] man I'm the one that you're supposed to
[33:43] be worshiping not this bulls and goats
[33:45] in this Messiah you say is coming and
[33:47] all this they see he's now going full
[33:50] 144,000 they're going to be separate
[33:51] it's going to be the old of the Orthodox
[33:53] Jew that hasn't received holy ghost of
[33:55] these two prophets are going to
[33:57] prophesize 1260 days take out 144,000
[34:00] and they're going to leave all right
[34:04] they're gone the Antichrist is dealing
[34:07] with the ones that are still building
[34:08] temples and putting sacrifices up and
[34:11] having all these offerings well now when
[34:14] do you do when do you make your one made
[34:16] your offering for the year
[34:23] that's over there's only one time of
[34:27] year that made that they could take that
[34:30] one lamb and make that one sacrifice and
[34:33] that covers them remember we look that's
[34:35] like a little bit but Passover if he
[34:38] comes in and Passover which is missing
[34:41] then you ought to be able to back it up
[34:43] 1260 days and that's where you got
[34:49] October of 2019 so that's the hardest
[34:54] time that is when the Feast of Trumpets
[35:00] occurred because remember the day of
[35:03] atonement there's not a morning for
[35:06] killing anything it's the morning that
[35:08] something has already been killed anyway
[35:10] we're going through that they haven't
[35:12] told us not a day that you make a
[35:14] sacrifice all right so now if you'll go
[35:18] to Zechariah Zechariah says to preach
[35:26] the prophet comes and they say where did
[35:28] you get those scars he says in the house
[35:31] of my friend through those two prophets
[35:34] they and then remember the Bible says
[35:37] that the man goes away from the wife and
[35:38] they mourn for so many days because they
[35:40] what some morning that they realized
[35:43] right here they realized they killed
[35:45] them aside two thousand and some odd
[35:47] years ago that's what the two prophets
[35:50] are going to preach to right they're
[35:52] gonna preach you killed him already well
[35:54] you are you looking for him for you've
[35:55] already killed him he's already brought
[35:57] a Gentile bride he's coming to get you
[35:58] and they're gonna mourn the Day of
[36:01] Atonement there's a mourning for the
[36:03] kill not that something's killed alright
[36:06] so we okay with those that right now you
[36:09] can position
[36:10] okay i'm not saying today listen I've
[36:13] told you 29 thing comes and leaves i'm
[36:15] still be standing around here i missed
[36:17] it somewhere i missed it but i think one
[36:21] thing for sure if we go to 20 if it goes
[36:24] through 20 27 that's the 71st you
[36:27] believe they can't be assembly first
[36:28] jubilee that's right if you go 50 years
[36:33] past 1977 you went into a 71st you
[36:36] believe you can't do that I mean there's
[36:39] no sending first you believe the 70 of
[36:43] Jubilee is going to continue on for the
[36:46] Jews did you believe for the Jews that's
[36:48] what they're looking for they're looking
[36:49] for time if you read Ezekiel where
[36:52] everything is going to come back
[36:53] together they're going to build a temple
[36:54] and they're going to have all this the
[36:56] tribal orders going to be back in and
[36:58] there's going to be peace for a thousand
[37:00] years it's not to us even the
[37:03] millenniums not to the bride we're
[37:06] barely human we're very as observes
[37:09] we're they're just having a vacation
[37:11] right cuz we don't have to build a
[37:13] temple and we don't have to do this
[37:15] we're done hey we gotta clarify how
[37:17] you're right mm-hmm will you need beside
[37:19] the glorified body total guy so far I'm
[37:25] just showing you that how perfect they
[37:27] will watch what the property God said we
[37:30] might kind of understand what are you
[37:34] talking about let's read one thing
[37:36] before we go I think I got any more
[37:46] ain't that a pretty girl asked my friend
[37:48] a that's my grandbaby rat very beautiful
[37:53] blue chenille assessment
[38:13] how I can say
[38:20] let's just make sure we see because
[38:22] because it may have been a little bit of
[38:23] cocoa on a t30 could watch 70 weeks a
[38:29] day all right here I Jesus Messiah rota
[38:33] the city of Jerusalem triumph on the
[38:35] back of a white mule on Palm Sunday now
[38:37] what is Palm sunny the the Sunday before
[38:40] the resurrection okay April the second
[38:45] 8030 users from Jerusalem Palm Sunday
[38:47] 8030 now we find from bc 4 45 280 30 is
[38:50] exactly 475 years but remember you had
[38:53] converted it into the 30 year calendar
[38:55] that's what he's going to do and then
[38:57] watch what we did on the sixth seal they
[39:00] say well run around meant a t-33 well I
[39:03] don't think something now this is the
[39:05] sixth seal brother Brian was talking
[39:07] about 90 24 24 and when was it preached
[39:11] now let's stop here these three verses
[39:13] they took place actually on Tuesday
[39:14] afternoon April of four sandy is April a
[39:18] sec that 90 was the third Tuesday was
[39:21] the fourth 8030 Jesus was crucified that
[39:26] friday that makes friday that same
[39:28] thought that week on friday and the
[39:30] first two verses took place in afternoon
[39:31] April fourth in a t30 all right no
[39:48] hello questions and answers 1963 after
[39:52] the sales and freight return from these
[39:55] people we know that Jesus was slain
[39:57] about 80 30 all right but we pretty much
[40:00] put that down he was he was killed in a
[40:02] t30 we proved he was born in for PC
[40:04] because that's when Herod gave the thing
[40:06] and Herod died right before the end of
[40:08] the end of the beast thing so he's born
[40:11] for me saying he died 8030 is 33 years
[40:13] old right it was about the middle of the
[40:16] year 1830 so so that mark on your count
[40:20] on your thing where the cross is that's
[40:22] a t30 not 33 nobody goes my toe brother
[40:28] brown say that and you know eat my flesh
[40:31] and drink my blood that wasn't explained
[40:33] very well but all explained in it
[40:35] communion that's what we're gonna have
[40:37] this afternoon session
[40:42] sunday will probable
