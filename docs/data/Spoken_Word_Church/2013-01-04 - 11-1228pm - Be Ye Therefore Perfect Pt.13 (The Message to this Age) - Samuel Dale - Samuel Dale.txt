amen Matthew 5 that we've been reading and Revelations three we thought we was going to be through with that but we just keep on going so we don't worry about it we the Lord will take care of it right amen Matthew 5:37 but let your communication be a y nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you this not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man shall Sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel the to go a mile go with him Twain give give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away you have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate and that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you why that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public and soul be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen let's just go over to one scripture Revelations 3:14 is the message to this age and what does it say and unto the angel of the Church of the lady of candra these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been studying for quite a while on this part of being therefore perfect and uh we've come down to a conclusion that we in our last message and we won't get through with these notes tonight I'm sure but I wanted you to read them and so uh keep them until the next Wednesday night and uh we'll be uh speaking on these things or carrying on the thought but you know the message to this age each age got a message a special uh revelation of about God and you know his ways and doings and things and we we just uh look at our age and we see that it says he's the beginning of the creation of God now what was our thoughts about reading from Matthew there in the scripture that we've been reading for quite a while you know of Matthew that uh it's talking about the uh fact that the Lord Jesus he had come from the the be Beatitudes of saying blessed are you you know because of this that and the other that persecutes you and thing but then he started changing kind of a course or order of of uh talking and as he did he be to talk about how the children of this new creation having his nature and all would come to the point that we would be able to uh withstand Satan when he comes after us and the ways that he always does and that we would be of that new race of people and that this age would get the special revelation of it of a new creation amen now each age got the new creation each age got the new birth all right but this is a summing up of all of the things and bringing it out to where that we can see you know the age that we're really living in amen and understanding then a a new creature as we read there in Matthew where it says uh this will be you you you'll be the children of God then you'll have this kind of a nature so he was saying you know this is the nature that is is expected to come into to you then he says be therefore perfect because that way he's saying that there's no way that you and I could uh have the nature that he spoke of right now uh think on this for a minute it is not our natural nature to turn the other cheek uh it's not our natural nature to if we're sued to give a man more than what he sues us far that's not our nature it's not our nature to do those things but if we have a new nature a new way amen then the Lord Jesus could be smitten on one side and turn the other one that's right all right see he's showing us as I said the only way that you and I can come to this place of where that we could ever think about being perfect right would to be to the basis that we could get rid of ourselves right right man and take take on a new nature or new ways a new thought all right and see that's why I I tried to to bring it to you there in the the last message as speaking about it that asking who was this man that could it's possible that the psalmist David would say and and Romans would say and brother randam would bring them together and and say it you know we brought those things out that that they would say blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin all right and see you could get all kind of definitions of certain well you know so good of a righteous person you know a good person and this that or the other or you could come into the message or the hour of people you know that well uh I was a child of God always was eternal so I don't have to worry about anything see and it would go into disgrace right amen upon all of the ways that we would try to understand it but I hope you picked up the point cuz I'm trying to make things so simple until you know uh an illiterate person can understand amen that's right and and that way then anybody can understand it that's right you know because you know you bring it down to a basis of a person that doesn't have much intelligence and and you just tell that person say now listen what you need to do you need to New Birth right right and they'd say well how do I get it right right well we can go through the the process of saying well you've got to do this and you got to do that but according to the prophet people ask about being saved and he said we try to tell them what to do and not do right but you see the the whole thing is to what repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's simple amen but it's true right it's held for 2,000 years amen as a simple thought right but now what would you tell the person then that would ask you that you'd say well now I know a lot of people that has repented and they have inde did sure and a lot of people got baptized in the correct way you know yep mhm and still didn't get saved no that's right you would agree with that wouldn't you that a lot of people don't well what's the problem now they've done what the word says mhm they followed the channel of the letter Y right mhm and they could even say now Lord like I've heard people say you know well now the Lord knows my heart and uh if he don't save me like the one man did and he was true about what he was saying he said Lord if you don't he was out in a a field play praying and he said Lord if you don't save me said you'll find a pile of bones laying here in this field when you come back well that man had a sincere heart and he meant it that's right amen but see how many people could go out in the yard or anywhere or do whatever and say now Lord you said it right and the prophet said the Bible says it in the prophet of God that we claim to said if we repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we shall be saved amen so now you said it and you meant it why is it they're not saved that's right come on you don't ever think or those that's right yes sir amen now I hope you understand what I'm saying because a lot of people are saved because that's the way they do it that's the way you got to go y right but what's the difference that was what I was trying to express to you the last message in so simple a terms of one thing before there can be a new birth there must be a death of the individual before they can receive a new birth amen not a killing of physically right but dying out to yourself MH and accepting Jesus Christ in your place to where that you are dead right amen cuz that that is the you say well no Brother D the the qualifications of the new birth is we got to be justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost see that's good right that's fine but you know there's a lot of people that are Justified a lot of people that are Sanctified yep and never receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right why because they never died amen right cuz you can't get the the the life until the death comes right death comes first first amen right this what I was trying to express to us and anyone else listening we don't hear much talked about dying we just hear all of this great about what we are and who we are and and what we was and how we was here and what was here and yeah and never talk about simply dying out to yourself amen cuz it can't be a new birth if you're not not dead amen amen right it just won't work that's right that's the message to this age right what that we must die out to ourselves that was a message of Paul's age that's a message to every age has been required a death right but this age right on this age is required more than just a death to get the new birth because it's going to require change of the body amen all right and if we can't die out to ourselves and get born again how in the world could we ever come to a change of a body right that's right amen are you listening see then that's where our trouble is see we must die out to ourselves to be born again amen then it's a continual dying to yourself amen all the way through life that's right and if we can become dead enough see then God can change each bodies that's right amen now if you don't get nothing out of the message tonight I want you to get this point before there can be a birth there must be a death amen before there can be a body change that's right are you listening there must be a group of people that are so dead now we're talking about body change right are you following me that's right I'm not talking about trying to dechristianize anybody or whatever I've preached that for 30 years told you 30 years or more ago that most of the people maybe even myself would not be able to have enough Faith to stand there for a change of the body the change in a moment the twinkle of an eye so we're going to have to go by the grave right you say well it's just old getting old we're getting old that's part of it right but there's a lot of young people that's in this message are dying also that's it's because and not de christianizing anybody that's right but if you and I can't die out to ourselves and become a new creation then we're not born again no that's right that's right then and this is the whole message tonight so then we'll back up and then we'll read and start again him then there comes such a sanctification under that six seal until the world is totally purged of sin that's right you agree man right the Jews are placed in there for the cleansing y the foolish virgins are there for the cleansing y but we don't have to go there amen cuz Jesus Christ has done paid the price yes sir amen amen so that means that we go in a Rapture before them amen but if all of us die and go by the grave who's going to be there for the change right right so why can't we contend that we are the people that will be changed yes sir amen and if it is it's going to take a dine right the prophet of God was praying there one time he said Lord you shed me you know like cutting a sheep cutting a wool off of a sheep you know sure every how you pronounce that word sure sure he said Lord you done it one time yes he said you took my wife you took my daughter y he said do it again Lord now that's how much he thought about it amen what he want to lose two second wife and another kid now that's about as dumb as anybody can get so that's all you can think about you in a terrible shape that's right he was wanting God to bring him down to his knees Amen to where he needed to be a death to himself amen all right see then we can't expect to have a change of the body I'm talking about you me all of us that's right until we learn to or bring that body under death man from the inside person amen right right amen it can't be done in their outside doings right right there's no way out side that you can can whip the body into to dying the more you whip it the worse it gets so it must be that we've got to start from the end inside so then this age gets a message then y a special message that he's the beginning of the creation of God Amen right all right and then there's no way that you can connect that to Natural things right amen and all must be to Supernatural spiritual things right all right and see he so died until he was the one that was telling us these things turn the other cheek do all of these things then he said be therefore perfect in other words be just is perfect in other words take on my nature right right right all right cuz it's only the only way that our bodies can be changed we've got to have this body's got to be if we don't believe in getting another one amen and that's why most people were talking about that earlier about it I've always told you that I told you the reason people don't believe in the people of this message I'm talking about a lot of a lot of preachers preach we're going to get a new body and they're talking about another body some say they're going to get a new body and they kind of leave it to where whoever wants to what group they're in to where you can decide what you want to believe about it right sorry it's just a way I thing right see everybody says they're going to get a new body don't mean they're going to get another body you talk to them a while and that's oh no I mean we're going to get this body redeemed well that's good but I'd rather just be blunt about it nobody don't have to worry about what I'm talking about that's righten but you see I've told you this how many times I made this statement the reason most people don't believe in getting that they want to get a new body they don't believe God is capable of redeeming this body right right that's it now they believe that he's capable of saving their soul and if he wants to he can heal the body yeah now you say well no no no no we know he can heal no that's that's the basis of it most people think that if he wants to that's what they do we'll ask the Lord to see what he wants to be done we'll ask the Lord if he wants to heal us you ever done that you ever said Lord do you want to heal me or is it right for you to heal me we're not supposed to do that right we're supposed to say we're healed amen see that way then people believe that you could be you know maybe if the Lord wants to he can heal you then they say well we're going to give some new body cuz you don't believe he's powerful enough to redeem this one now that's not the message of this age that was what hit me I had notes in this to go on with another point tonight but it kept hitting on this cuz I want you to make sure you understood what I was say in this past Wednesday that you and I must die amen we've got to die for oursel to be born again amen see Paul said it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me right right right he had no point or thought of his own self cuz he believed he was dead I was noticing there we was the other day listening or either today reading or yesterday or something brother Brown said that I died 32 years ago m now my daddy died somewhere about 1945 it'd be hard to condemn him of or bring a case against him about a crime today wouldn't it because he's dead but you see that's the way we're supposed to be right we're supposed supposed to be so dead until we're not alive anymore cuz you can't be a new Creature if you're alive did you understand what I was trying to bring out Amen to be a new creature Paul said that you're a new creation you new creature there in what it 2 Corinthians 5:17 or first one a new creation well if you're a new creation then the old creation can't be alive at the same time cuz the prophet of God said he's not dealing by that ways and see there's no way for us to to still be alive and Christ alive in us too right he said no now brother there we're still yeah we're still alive that's our problem man because there a body and the spirit to be dealt with right that didn't die to get a new birth right it was only the death of the Soul right right and it wasn't the death of the Soul like taking the soul out and throwing it away it was the death of the nature of that Soul right yes sir amen which was of the world right that's right see then God can come in and live man but if we're not dead he can't come in and live that's right you you can't claim to be a new Creature if the old creature still lives that's why you're born again in your soul not your body and your spirit see in body and spirit we're still of the old creation right amen even though we've been given a new spirit that still is not the Holy Spirit right right that's just a new spirit cuz you couldn't stand your own self the prophet said right he said you had to get a new spirit to be able to even fellowship with God and in any form right that's it you see why the new birth is the most important thing in there is amen I reading today where brother R said when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said you get everything he said you get all the power you need he said you get all the healing you need he said you get all the Deliverance you need that's right when you receive the new birth he said but you just got to keep drinking and pushing out right that's right see that's our part right is to drink in and push out God supplies it but you see then it's a dead man that Paul is talking about that God won't impute sin that's right M it's a dead man the psalmist David was talking about because there's no way impute sin to a dead man right amen if he's truly dead mhm all right and if we're not dead we didn't get the new birth right come on is that true right MH see the problem with most people as they say it they'll take the word follow the word right to the l y I've had people to tell me that say brother Dale I've done everything thing that God told me to do and what's wrong why haven't I received the New Birth when I've done everything he told me to do I said I had received a new birth well now doing what God says to do is wonderful or don't do but I thought we believe that even Abraham received an unconditional Covenant y amen and that we are the Seed of Abraham by faith amen by the new birth now justification in this day don't put you in the body of Christ so your sins can be chopped off and that's good you can be Sanctified right cleansed and set aside for service wonderful but that's not death no Amen Brother Brad on a future home if you'll read it right about 15 16 right there somewhere you hear him saying this he said when that Holy Ghost comes in he said it burns out everything that's left that's right amen you said well the unclean Spirit went out you know everything went out what what's left you and I yeah that's it amen that's what's left you and I right what would we be y turn it loose right there you just go right back to the pig pin right but you see we've got to be to be born again we've got to have a death amen right amen and that's the man now how is it possible for you and I to die spiritually speaking it's easy to understand natural death right whacker got's head off at gone right but spiritually speaking see we must die out to ourselves right we must come to a place we saying Lord there's nothing I can do that's right I've done all I can do I've done what you asked me to do right now if there's anything wrong let me know if not let me die right and when we talk about dying to ourselves that means we give up all rights yep amen she don't have no rights we give up all the rights everything well bless God I I'll tell you what you you fool with me I ain't turning the other cheek you're not dead right amen I told you about it that was one of the things I always wondered in my life even after becoming a Christian I thought cuz I it just that way I understood how that two men could take gloves and slap each other's face and because of an argument turn around take a gun and just shoot each other cuz that was an insult see this you insult the person and they're dignity is demanded and they must shoot or kill you know or die I can understand that because that was the way I was made don't say good that I ain't never lost a fight yet I might have run away from a few I never lost one but now listen I can understand those things right and I always wondered I thought Lord is your grace sufficient I I don't know Lord I believe you I believe I'm born again and all that Lord but you know and by doing that you know what it meant it me I was opening up that door for Satan to try me that's right and I shouldn't have been thinking that way but I was just honest ain't you right that's the best way to be with your own s and the got there work one day you remember something happened and he slapped my jaws I mean he rung them good and I just stood there grinning and looking at him I thought it's gone I mean you seen what a expression come over this man's face when he just slapped a guy that was as big as he was and you know and the guy didn't move I just stood there grinning at him he just turned around and left and I mean he got gone he stayed gone for he's supposed to repair what I was doing you know he stayed gone quite a while and he come back he said I'm sorry about what I done I said that's all right see I found out that at least at that point that man was dead right sure now you know I spend a lot of time explaining things as we've reading in Matthew in Matthew it says if a man sues you for your coat give him your CL cultural now I mean now how does that work out you know all right now that's M okay now brother call you sued me from there's my coat all right just take everything else I got now is that what that means now come on be sensible is that what that means the guy sues you for your coat give him your cloak also is that what that means words you just give him everything you got I don't think that way that's right I don't think that's what he's trying to make the point the point is if a man sues you for you coat and your cloak all right and the judge says now I we just take your coat well then all right I'll just give him a cloak to I don't think it means to be just give everything you say yes it does well okay I'm just making a good point because that's what I mean by death right that's that day there was something there when that man slapped me there was something there that I had no thoughts about hitting him whatsoever right I felt sorry for him and no thoughts of striking him I want to hug his neck he done me a favor right right he let me know something but now let's get on that point but now does it mean that he comes back and he he says well I tell you what let me just do it again turn the other okay go ahead then he turns back hit now after a while you're going to end something see we're not done right right you don't just stand there and say well here's the other cheat here's the other cheat here's the other cheat here's the other cheat no no I'm not that a mate I'm I'm sorry maybe you are maybe that's what you think now I'm just telling you there was something there that day that was letting me know the next day if that guy slapped me I might have hit him back you say brother Dale I'm just telling you like it is that's the way I talk you won't talk that way but I do you want a goody goody so much until you do it then first thing you know you blow up and you lose it and then when you lose it you don't know what to do see I don't I don't have to worry about it then I believe that if one of you SLA me again that'd be fine I can take it but it's just like I told a man one day he said I'm coming over there and beat you to death I said you won't come over here I'm pretty good size well guy you know and when I don't green I look a little bit tough you know you won't come over here why not I said cuz you don't know whether I'm going to hit you back or not and I said I really don't know either do you get over here I'm just honest what are you sure and what I'm getting at is one thing what does it mean to die Ain got know forgive it what does it mean to die you die to yourself and you become born again right but you still got a lot of problems right right a lot of troubles lot of heartaches need a lot of trials and tribulation need a lot of patience you need a lot of virtue and knowledge and Temperance and things right and God understand that you know got to understands those thing right so he gives it to us when we need it thank God for that that's right but you see he gives us enough to get born again now the rest of it now this is what I've always tried to preach to you from the day I started hear in any form of preaching I've tried to preach one thing salvation is of the Lord Jonah 2:9 you accept it God accepts you brother R said if God don't accept you you don't have it he said whether or not you accept him is not the point he said it's whether or not he accepts you that's right right right see if he accepts you that's fine amen but you say well I've accepted him all right wonderful and that's if that's a genuine acceptance right that's it he'll accept you right amen but if it's not genuine it's words thoughts and our mouth wiggling a lot but you see even after he gives you the new birth right we got a lot of dying to do right right there is when we can really start dying to ourselves right what we' done before then was accepting him as our place you know in our place or what he done for us accepting him as a savior and then he accepts us but when you become born again now here's what legalists don't like and and disgraced people don't like the way that I preach I'm sorry I just like to tell it like it is cuz you see when we become a Christian we we become responsible right right that's it amen yes sir come on we become responsible y amen that's why I know know always T you you know Paul said you know they they got to the point they thought that Paul was saying well let's just let's just go out of sin where we get more grace he said where could abound he said God forbid amen whatever you make yourself a servant to is who your master is Right amen paraphrase but you see once we become a Christian then is when we can really start dying right the nature change has come the new birth is present we're a new creature a new creation not I that liveth Paul said but Christ that liveth in me amen but see we fail to read the rest of it he said and the life that I now live in the flesh right yep he brought his body right into it right he said I live by the faith of God Amen I Die daily he said right what about a man that's beat five times and Shipwrecked all these other things and then he he doesn't say a thing about that is being any of his death right amen come on read it he doesn't bring in all of the things that happen to him as to be anything of a death right he just says I Die daily but are you following me the new birth puts us in a place that when then we can start yielding ourselves right right turning ourselves over to him yeah now is where a lot of the word has to come in yeah I've always taught you that because I believe it I believe the stature of perfect man can only be added because of the revealing of the word amen that's right not because you desire to have patience and you to say well I'll have it no people say I tell you I've heard people say this then well I tell you what I I didn't know whether I was a Christian or not but I read in the Bible one day that the that The Godly in Christ you know she'll suffer persecution said well I've been in a lot of persecution so I know I'm a Christian now I've never said that cuz I don't believe it way right amen I believe there is a lot of persecution a lot of troubles right amen I believe you must be born again to be a Christian amen right become a new creature the old man's got to be dead to be a new creature right I I love the story The Prophet told about the man you know that killed the the the King's son or what it was there you know you come down to see him and they wouldn't even feeding the guy they wouldn't doing anything cuz he killed the King's son he asked him said why don't you kill him he said well in the fit of rage I'm sorry he walks out you remember the story he sent him back down there with clothes and and everything to wash him up clean him up right to destroy all of his records amen and bring him out so now you're my son amen put the robe on him you're my son amen yes sir you know what that King was actually saying absolutely he was saying that my son that I had and fathered and raised up and you killed no longer exist right MH thank you Lord come on think about it that's that's the way I think of the story yes sir my son no longer exist records of my son have been destroyed records of your life has been destroyed not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me amen a new creation Romans 6 and2 he says that we' got to be dead to sin that's right you ever do anything wrong Brother D every day brother randam do you sin every day he said every day now you got to explain sin why because that's the way people run with it they don't think about what a man is saying was brother around him saying that he disbelieved God's word no but he done explain that the only sin that there is is to disbelieve God's word is that true right amen but yet he said he sinned every day so there must be something about Sin that we don't understand he said it's not a sin that drinks run around all these other things but he said if we don't repent we're going to have to answer for them that's right right so you're going to have to answer for him as a record kept you know what that means if a record is kept against me I'm not dead right see so right I'm not dead if a record is kept well don't you think you make mistake yes I do but brother R said when a Christian makes a mistakes he said he immediately says I'm sorry right how would you like this quote he said you say you're sorry he said and it never was yep accounted right y because God knew you was going to say you're sorry mhm amen that's how pure it is am right sir how about one I've got it in and probably get to it later with it how about one where that God sees you when you're born again you know how brother around said God seen you when you were born again he said he seen you just exactly like that he saw you before the world Amen that's right that's it MH now that's how beautiful a Christian is amen he sees you just like he saw you before the world Amen when a lamb was stood and slain mhm to cover everything can be taken care of see what it means to be a new creature not the old creation made over 2 Corinthians 5:17 the new creature all things have become new now how a man could be see right if he's alive it's not new right but if he died to me the best way to to do a a a point of what we'll be thinking about I know it's carnal but there's such a word as we call it Amnesia and something happens you get hit or something and you just forget everything wouldn't it be great right amen wouldn't it be great if that could happen right now right amen and you know what I'd be glad to take the hit on the head y right if you just make sure it worked I don't want the hit on the head and it not work the Amnesia yep you know we you don't remember see then all things has become new if it's never corrected which generally is you know true time and things happening it's gener corrected but if it never was corrected you know what you have a total new identity amen would that be something sure absolutely amen well you know that's what God done for us sure right that's right by giving us a new birth thank you Lord amen give us a total new identity amen let's just read a few I got a whole bunch in here I got 21 I think it is and some of them's got about six paragraphs all right so uh you just take them home read them we'll get back to it look what brother Brown said about us on the token 1964 uh 308 1964 of the token now the promises make free from sin CHS that God hasn't hasn't recognized your sin David said all right listen blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin too and God will never impute sin over that token because the token is the paid price that God has already received it and you got a token for it the your faith has bought it amen and you have the purchased price of your redemption in your body mhm to worship him and show forth his promises and power see it even comes out into the body course you bring the body under subjection you begin to let the man die look at the next one this is the serpent seed 1958 9:28 the evening service did not David say blessed is the man to whom God will not reckon sin and impute sin too God don't hold a sin against this creature I gave you that one the other night but I wanted to read it again this creature he doesn't reckon sin to the righteous right now who's righteous none of us Jes right amen none of us is righteous amen right that's right but God is righteous so if God's living in you then he makes you righteous right see let me let me explain something right there does he make you righteous now watch we'll get on down here in a little bit you understand reason I'm saying this does he make you righteous because you ain't careful you'll have something there you begin to try to work something with it and you'll try to take the old ways and try to make something I does he make you righteous or does he impart his righteousness right now which one is it amen that's see now if he gives his own righteousness is not making you righteous right he's not making you righteous he's imparting his righteousness to you right right amen that way then you become righteous right sure but see if you ain't careful you'll say he made me see then you get your big self in the way well look what I had something to do with it cuz he made me no no no no no all he wants you and I is to die amen that's right if we die he can live amen he died that we might live amen amen that's all he asked now look what he says we're going to get a good bit of reading here in the minute off for some of this oh we read this in in Revelation 34 that is the beginning of the creation of God look what he says 336 of the church age book now he's but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing us Noe see that we still like it but if you read it right he'll get to us right but just remember that he comes before to us amen is that maybe I'm crazy but as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation Now want you this has to do with the church yeah but who is the church this is a special designation of himself right so it's not you and I it's him right right he is the creator of that church now watch what he describes CU see then you come right back and watch him this has to do with the church this is this is another creation and then he jumps right down and explains what he comes in and how it takes place see watch The Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride amen now as the spirit of God no yep as the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born he's either got to be making that that as a personal point to tie together or they should have shoved that down and made another paragraph cuz it looks like he just changed thoughts I'm not no English major but I know one thing when you change thoughts you change paragraphs right that's a sensible way of looking in English but he ties it all together and gives you the conclusion Sal from which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very s in the wound of Mary for that body it was not enough for that the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human over him supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that's right now watch even if the Holy Spirit gave birth to what Mary was doing it would be a sinful body you read it come on Sir amen that would not have produced the LI Adam of him it was said l a body thou had thou father prepared for me God not Mary provided that body Mary was the human incubator and she carried the holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was of the new creation right man and God met remember the other week Heaven and Earth kissed each other other righteousness and peace all right man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race and he tells you who that is that's Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that though man was of the old order or creation Now in Union with Christ he has become a new become the new creation of God right Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ Jesus under good works Ephesians 4:20 and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham of Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac line but now out of ever Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation right he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of Man by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation not another creation special designation of itself is right where we started at who is this new creation what possibility does a human being have of being a new creation right by dying to accept and accepting Jesus Christ right by the new birth right the only way it can be done what did he say he talking about church God body right right come on you reading all the way down you got it in front of you take home read it reading done it he's talking about himself he's talking about his church he's talking about what the church is the church is him not another person not another creation it's the same creation now look what he says this is a true revelation of God what is the true revelation of God that God by him coming into human flesh made way that he could by being the beginning of the creation of God Amen that he could become into you and I right and brother Rand said we'll get to it in just a minute where he said it he's the with the rest of that creation right look the true revelation of God what that's why we're not Oneness man Oneness is that Jesus was the life form of God no the Bride of Jesus Christ is the life form of God Amen that's right then there be a dispensational change goes to Israel right they'll be the light form but right here in this Gentile dispensation we're part of the Revelation right a special designation if you read it off the face of himself y That's Right not you and I why cuz we're dead come on we're dead if we're dead we can be a part of the new creation but if we're still alive his death didn't do anything for us this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age where all would be over and when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pip by his own decree he elected the members of his new creation right 38 brother we had to pull this in now he's got to come up to pick up another one it's 3A on the back of your thing right proven his word 64816 look what he says that is the beginning of the creation of God this is the continuation of the creation of God right y then the whole world whole earth right now watch it what's he meaning what's he getting at and the whole earth has to have baptism yep you know this world is going to be a new creation yes sir absolutely right they won't be annihilated remember so our bodies won't be annihilated right right the world won't be annihilated where you Prophet the future home spend all the time talking about it right mhm it's burning off the sin getting rid of all of the sin and the death and things that's right it'll be a new creation thank you Lord this world y yes that's right you know that's what so lot of the people of the message they saying we're going to a future home in New Creation and then say we got to have another body yeah ain't that something my mind don't comprehend that way no that's right I'm sorry I just don't think that way then the whole earth has to have a baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down in a city to dwell upon the earth and the Tabernacle of God is with man and dwells with them God has Tabernacle here on the Earth this whole Redemption plan justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost the same as it is then amen you know that in the Millennium when we ride back with him we are the anointing to the temple right Daniel 70 weeks come on you glad to get you the quote we are the ano oting to the temple that's how much God thinks about his bride amen that's how much she's a part of him y right like I've always said my kids is not a milles uh-uh they wouldn't be my kids natural adoption don't work in this situation no natural adoption can't pass DNA right right but look a new creation and the world even comes out to be a new creation amen MH a brand new recreated Earth a new creation amen we're in dwell of righteousness not the old made over brother brand said as far as Sin has went will how to be cleansed or purged amen so as deep as a hole as there ever been in the world that's how deep sin went that's right 2 3,000 5,000 ft whatever how many feet there is are these all Wells what they're digging that's how far it's going to be cleansed out in the atmosphere as far as man travels and sends a rocket has got to be cleansed you said well that ain't no problem because there a rocket going out there that's right anywhere sin goes God's going to destroy right amen right but he won't destroy the core of the earth he won't destroy the whole world he just destroys the world order Cosmos so he doesn't destroy your body M right yeah you don't have to get a new one right cuz he doesn't destroy your body he redeemed you amen he makes it Eternal but to do that we got to die out to ourselves to come to that place because that's what he done with a new birth he didn't destroy the soul he destroyed the nature of the Soul right amen and come to live in it amen not the old made over no that won't work that's right that will not work let's read a couple of what he's talking about and then we'll quit on it number four brother we got brother Bob Brother Richard back there tonight we got I told Tyler when it come in cuz we always saying you got to do this you got to do that if Josh is not here he got to go run the table I said Tyler you're an absente de replacement I said anything you see missing just go stand there I said if I don't make it out you got to take over that's right so he's he's an absentee replacement that's right thank God for all of these amen that's right all of them yes sir all of you your job work look what brother rown said though the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost is the presuming let's see yeah number four that's right the Holy Ghost is the power of God that sends you into the heart as a witness of the spirit you're born again your life is cleaned up the world is dead and all the stink of it it's like the garlic in Egypt see you're far away from it you're a new creature in Christ Jesus old things has passed away you become new allog together a new creation born of the spirit yes sir your whole members of your body submissive to his spirit and you're moving in the Holy Ghost and not listening to the sound of the world your eyes are on Heavenly things that's that's that's when you're really God is vind ating the thing amen that's what the new birth is Amen to just make us a new creature I wish you'd think about that right am a new creature mhm you're not alive anymore what is that song they s you know he's not here anymore he's gone yeah he don't live here anymore think on it look the next one the marriage of the Lamb 19621 the evening service paragraph 102 then we become not artificial name but by a real ity of the Holy Spirit of Life connecting us into Christ then through the power of his resurrection we are rais from the dead things of the world and sitting with him in Heavenly places amen I like that don't you don't you like it amen Heavenly places yes right we're not even in this world right spiritually speaking we're not here right we're in Heavenly places amen right am amen you know you can be in places all by yourself just worshiping and just having a good time and just just right Heavenly places so it goes to show you're not here anymore you're in heaven right you're a new creature you're deaden you been resurrected right in Heavenly places in Christ right I like that see tonight we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus see resurrected with him dead to the things of the world and took on Christ and when we take on Christ then the world is dead then we no more care for the world now that's where we stop always do it because of just honest you take that statement right there and and every one of us is said in this bu is going to die and go to hell right right oh you talk like that brother well have you done anything worldly today I mean did you eat did you take a bath did you drive the church all those things are worldly right but now are they worldly of the point of world worldly come on are you thinking is that worldly to take a bath I think I hope everybody does it sure smells better amen amen amen that saying is you know cleaning is next to God that's not in the Bible what good saying but what is he talking about dead to the world right mhm is it wrong to live is it wrong to work make money have families enjoy life is that what he's talking about no no Jesus Christ lived ate slept done all the things was that worldly that's what I mean see we we get those things in there and then we we Shuffle it down and sometimes we can't understand and we say well are we worldly we're not worldly for living now if we make it worldly right right that's right MH see then you have to determine what's life and what's worldly right right the story was told of JC penies did used to go to church and used to tith and used to do all the things need to slow down cuz he got so big got so many businesses and places so the preacher finally went to see him Pastor did he said well I've just been so busy he said I can't I just can't serve the Lord I'm so busy you know doing this and all these new buildings and all these new things and no preacher said well okay let's pray and I'll leave he got down and he said Lord Mr penny is just too busy said would you you burn down a bunch of his stores and make a crash on everything and get him busted the preacher said he felt a hand reach over on him said I got the message right nothing wrong being worldly the turno which was the big tractor place or what you call a big machinery that was up here at TCO it was you know made all kind of heavy equipment the story was told of him said he started out giving 10% said he decided to okay I'll just see what'll happen he just set up in his tithe he wound up giving 90% he couldn't spend what he had left now is that worldly JC penage was worldly when he went into the world and wouldn't go to church right and wouldn't pay his TI and keep up with serving the lord that was worldly right that's right amen right amen true so now we're distinguishing worldly but what does it mean worldly there nothing wrong with living in life enjoying life that's right as long as we don't let life rule us right righten when we let life rule us it's worldly no matter what it is eating too much fat but you see what see when I when I come across this I think what is the people thinking right the brother brand said we we we're not worly you don't think that way when you read some things he stay he says you know Church we're just not worly let's go and get hamburger when to get through I'll meet you down here we we'll go we're going hunting tomorrow we're leaving out going going to California I mean going to Colorado going to be gone hunting two weeks well brother Brown I sounds like whirlings no because Jesus told his disciples come aside and rest sure you remember right because they we're tired worn out been preaching going come aside and rest nothing wrong with life so when he talking about world what's he talking about when he talking about Sin what's brother R talking about when he's talking about Sin and he said he sinned every day but then said sin is to disbelieve the word brother you disbel the word every day now we try to prop that up with some kind of a way just be honest about it there's a little word sin the Bible says there's a sin not under death right amen but there is a sin under death then we don't even pray for it you see where me as a pastor I try to look down and see what people are thinking try to get what's what's on your mind it's not a sin of us to to live and be life and enjoy life right that's right but when we go overboard then we're turning it in to a point of turning down God's word right forsake not your sing yourselves together is God's word that's right that's just as much now brother Bram never said that's going to be a good one brother R never said that assing failing to assemble yourself to church you know is not sin they said drinking G and smoking EXA running around he said that's not sin right right but show me where he ever said failing to assemble your together was sin no he know that see that that's right amen he didn't have to make it right right don't that's her choice if you don't understand I've always told you I wonder what happened if you come up here one night and and I wouldn't hear well brother son home home yeah okay pull it back up brother amen pull let back up cuz we're not through marriage of the Lamb number five can you pull it back up takes them a while in our jugle the books okay but look what he said then the world is dead then we are no more care for the world yeah the world is dead to us and we're and it's dead to us and we're dead to it you're a different person different personality because you're a new creation right different personality creation not the same creation polished up right not a a man that's turned a new Leaf but a man that's dead and been born again and become a new creation in Christ Jesus and the spirit of the Living God lives in the person right think on these things let's get one more I told him we were going to try to make it to eight but we won't make it down to number eight look at the next from 1962 uh 621 which would be confirmation and evidence now I feel religious why we are dead and our lives is hid in God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost I look back and see where I once was that William Bram died 32 years ago there and now we are a new creation in Christ already raised with him set with him now in Heavenly places with the authority of his promised word that ever devil shall be subject to us and nothing shall in any wise in other words right going down get an excellent Richard let's go the token 1963 11:28 the evening service paragraph 183 but when really the product the new life of Jesus Christ comes into a man or woman he is a new creation the old man is dead he is finished he's done that token must always display all right let's get to the last one on number eight then we'll quit Christianity versus idolatry 19611 1217 if you haven't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ there's a pool full of water here and when you raise up out of that water you're rising to walk with Christ in a new life you are dead then you are no more temper and everything is everything's gone away You're New Creation in Christ then he raises you up by the Holy Ghost and sets you in Heavenly places with himself far above all powers and of this world right so keep the rest of those it'll be on the new creation when we get back to it CU we ain't got the time but listen church I'm just honestly trying to talk to all of us but if you take a line like a lot of people think on something that's run a line across you're going to condemn every one of us I mean there's no hopes of any in individual nowhere on the line of what most people call Sin what people most people call you know whism I've had people to condemn me for deer hunting that's worthy ISM well is it yeah that's all I do right yeah right that's right that's where is that's all I do you know in other words I let that stand in between me and the Lord right that's why when we go hunting you know and we've had to miss times because we had to where we'd be but 99.9% of the time we're in church when the services wrong that's right not me I didn't call we even tried to find the church and we couldn't find nothing I said go down to the Catholics I ain't never been to M I ain't making a joke out of it I I ain't never been let's find us a Catholic church we'll go in and sit down wouldn't make fun of them make no lie to them ain't never been there want to go to church I felt bad all day Sunday yeah why because we our church that's right that's I mean that's just true and I'm not a legalist on that point but I am one thing I love God's people and I love to fellowship with you and to be with you and to get together and sit around what's wrong with that is that worldly I mean we gather together and we Fellowship of Christmas we do it for for Easter we do it for for uh Valentine's Day we do it for and is that worldly if it is where's your spirituality I just mean that obviously does it make us more spiritual because we don't do these things what is world is see we condemn everybody in the world all things I do you don't do now listen I believe brother random was an image don't you amen sir but you take check the dates on the tapes and see how many days between the dates that he preached that he wasn't preaching and sometimes it'll be two weeks sometimes it'll be almost a month that you won't hard to have any services but the man was wore out he had to get alone absolutely amen he said I'm out there said said you see this but he said it's nothing he said when I'm out there that's when he's speaking to me he said I'm out there filling up but I do like what a lady over in South Carolina one time her husband said brother Brown went hunting to get out of the spirit you know to go help him you know in life she said honey you don't need to get out of the spirit so that's good point cuz you can take that and make it wor is right but what is sin what is death just dying out to ourselves and letting him live that's right the de I can get and listen this old boy got a lot of problems I'm a human but I try to keep him under the blood right right that's it and I try to pray for you and myself every day over and over and over amen wake up in the middle of the night and just start praying I said well San you wake me up you going to hear me talk to the Lord and I go back to sleep that's right right you know after a while he begin he won't wake you up too much so some of you that's got what is that a word inia what is it can't sleep right if you can't sleep start praying for me that's right there you go and I'll guarantee you you'll fall asleep in just a few minutes that's true right cuz Satan ain't going to let you do much praying so just keep praying you say well I stayed awake all night my wife told I've stayed awake all night all right pray maybe that's what God wants you to do that's right right right yeah just stay away and pray maybe he's using you to pray for somebody that's right maybe he's interceding through you amen yes sir that's what brother Al used to tell me he said wake up at 3:00 said I pray for you I said Lord wake him up at 1 you know a couple hours extra that's amen why can't we be that way I don't let the devil get credit for anything brother Neville I remember what happened come on brother mus this brother Neville he failed and U I got to hear him preach one time we did when was up Tabernacle and a wonderful guy but he fell off of a porch or something and broke his arm or done something and somebody said something to him he said no way in the world that wouldn't he said that wouldn't the devil he said that's the Lord said I'm just getting out too far said he needed me to slow down where to pray said he put me on the back let's qu ring on the devil right right I've always told you we always use that saying the devil made me do it I don't blame you for everything I do I do a lot of it myself how about you just be honest no it's the devil always brother Dale with me yeah okay all right but what about a new creature to have a new birth you must die right for us to get a change of the body so somebody's going to come to a place that we're going to be dead to ourselves and alive in Jesus Christ and then God will change the body a new creation this is this age this is the age of the new creation because it goes if you understood what I far it goes from the new birth in this age to the change of the body right to the change of the world yes Amen in this age yep that's right no other age could ever do that let's stand together that's right there was no way any other age could could operate like this age it's a special age that's why I brother around said it's a special designation but he said it's of himself right read that over and over I read that all the time there in the church age book Donnie the other day he working on my truck I appreciate him and brother Mark for fixing old truck up and things but he's coming he said where'd you get that tape it was in the thing I said well brother Richard made it off for me reading the church 's book and he said well I've been playing that ever since I D right and doing that I just keep it in there and I just listen to the same tape and I get through I click it back and start again I don't even get for number two tape in I just on that number one till I wear it out and then I'll switch over and get number two tight see it's just something what an opportunity you and I have that's right right I just sat down there on that deer stand and just take that old thing and just stick it in my ear and just sit her and look around and just listen to brother Brandon preaching what a wonderful opportunity right amen you said well you sure don't kill lot of De I don't work about that here but I sure get a lot of listening to sometimes I have listened three tapes sure just sitting on De stand Listen to Three tapes well you know what what would I be doing if I was at home I'd be busy with doing something else I wouldn't be getting that done so maybe that's sometimes that's just way I get my little awful eye you know out of the way and sit down and listen because we want to be a Christian that's right right right a new creature they wrote around and when he got over there what in communion he said I'm not the son of Charles and Ne branam yeah he wasn't denying his mother and Daddy he knew what a creation was that's right man he was that go ahead 120 red book come unto me 120 if anybody has a need are you a new
