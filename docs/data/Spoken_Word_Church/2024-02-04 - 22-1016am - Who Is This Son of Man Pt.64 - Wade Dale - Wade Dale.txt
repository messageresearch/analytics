let's give the Lord a hand clap of Praise give him my life away what brother Brown say the Holy Ghost what was it living for others amen living for others brother Dell always said it's something so precious as soon as you get it you want to give it away that's a paradox in your mind in your mind you a no remember we're preaching on selfish a little bit here you know you're a little selfish when somebody gives you something you know it's m no when God gives you something first thing you want to do is give it away amen because that's just part of of the uh giving heart that he gave his life for me and you it's only a small portion that we give back to him and we appreciate what he did for us at Calvary never forget that never forget salvation amen good to be back good to be in the house of the Lord thank you brother lis that was a good job Wednesday night thank you all for coming and giving him support and uh and being with u being with everybody here there on Wednesday night and we

mean I gave him the goodness so but uh we thank the Lord for for giving us an opportunity to be able to get away for a little while and to uh enjoy the uh enjoy the outdoors uh so by way of announcements remember questions and answers will be this afternoon at at the regular service everybody just a normal regular service but we'll be answering a few questions I've got three so far and if you have any more you can bring between service we'll try to answer them and I do have a service I do have a a message after that so if don't think you going to get out of here no 30 minutes or something okay all right not going to happen all right remember brother Bob be speaking for us this Wednesday night uh remember the bethle Youth Camp coming up the 27th through the 30th that is one of the questions that one of the youth asked is how to approach youth camps which is a good question all right what you know what's it what are they for what are they good for why should they go and and all that so we'll answer that this afternoon now there'll be there'll be no bible study on the 5th we we're now getting into heading into November because there will be a wedding the next day on Sunday at 4:00 Lily and Zach make sure you RSVP if you're going no kids under 15 there'll be no bible study on the 5th also remember change your clocks that Saturday fall backwards on November the 5th fall back one hour you get one hour extra sleep all right so it be only one service on the 6 then at 4:00 there'll be a wedding then on November the 13th there'll be the church dinner and then I think the first Sunday of December is when we're going to have our church Christmas uh dinner so if anybody's got a a play or anything that we going to that some of you kids want to do or practice a song or something for that it it's very early in December it won't be dur close to the 25th it' be very early so we need to get it done that means that's only about 7 weeks away so just remember that also after this service practice get with Sister Christine and and um the youth will practice the song before you eat you come up here and practice a song get it done all right immediately after the service everybody got that say Amen all right and just remember each one in prayers one a sick good to see sister Freda back good to see brother Paul back with us and good to have everybody here healthy out alert so let's go to John 1:1 where we've been before and I was U studying a little bit last night and continuing on but something struck me just a few minutes ago so we're going to uh anybody ever said it's all in your head yeah it's all in your head a come on man it's all in your head we're going to talk about that a little bit cuz remember memory reason conscious affection and Imagination comes from where your head your stinking thinking but I'm going to read you here in a few minutes that we got to have a renewing of of your mind or we must have the mind of Christ so something's got to transfer when we start with these virtues it's got to be something so abnormal right from what your every day oh we got to be virtuous we got to stay a virgin that's fine but that doesn't it's not what that virtue means that means power that means strength that means something coming from you that means Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I unto thee look how selfish unselfish Peter and John were such as I have give I unto you that's where we talk we're going to talk about that we got to get our minds set first because remember we know one thing for sure your flesh is never perfect we know that I've T you that taught you that many many times it doesn't sin it's motivated by what's inside of you now listen this was born in sin and it's going to die if we don't take a body change but that doesn't have anything to do with your soul that's right and if your soul is redeemed and then we get the memory reason conscious affection imagination heading toward God then the flesh will have to become under subjection to that cuz now your flesh is under subjection because you two you didn't want to come to church right you took your flesh somewhere else amen you took your flesh somewhere else you held a beer with his hand not a Bible but now what happened the one inside of you were changed was changed to bring us to a not just a it's all in your head and it's not just so much but it is a mental adjustment we've all got to come to a mental adjustment from being humans to being Eternal in the same body all right we got to learn to separate it we got to learn how to put it back together because that's what these virtues are amen that's living through your spirit realm to get to the outside guy all right to get to where the moving part is all right so we'll about that in just a little while let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day we ask you just be with us help the ones that are sick Lord the ones that are not with us the ones that are traveling maybe still be on vacation we ask you Lord that you be with each one father just anoint us for this journey that we're on Lord we're not going to leave anybody behind Lord we want everybody to go with us father we pray that you would just give us spiritual Insight We Are Spiritual people Lord you told us that we love revelation so father reveal yourself to us today Lord beyond anything else reveal yourself through the word of God just be with the ones Lord that are not here ones that are sin siake father we pray that you'd be with each one Lord and just bring them back to you father we're praying for all of the ones our our wayward children and loved ones and different ones Lord we're praying earnestly because that door is going to shut on that Ark and you're going to shut it Lord we're not going to be able to do it you're going to be able to be the one that shuts it but it's got to come when when we come to a place where we can say it's not all in our head that it is become a reality father we pray that You' just bless us now and take care of us in Jesus name and the further this service Amen in the beginning was word word was with God and Word was God and the Word was made flesh that's what we're trying to get the word was made flesh all right but by Listen by the transforming power of God he's turned he's turning your flesh when we take a body change folks it's not going to be a body from your mom and daddy amen this did but it's going going to be changed something's going to be changed in the atoms of your body and you're going to become the word just as Jesus is now the fullness of the word made flesh in a glorified body is everybody with me that's what we're heading toward we're not heading toward anything else that's what we have a mandate in this end time is to have a body change nothing else that's right all right you say oh brother nothing else listen if it wasn't for the opening of those seals in 1963 I'll read it to you in a few minutes the greatest battle ever fought he said now the battle begins now is when the battle begins today is when the battle's going to begin what the battle for a body change nobody's ever conquered it but a bride's going to conquer it we're going to be given the equipment to do it with and what is it it's the word of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the Lord his Blessing to the reading of the word word let's read first Thessalonians there while you're getting your seats adjusted and all warm and Co in yeah don't fall asleep that every one of you should hey K why you standing here here I give these out there's about 50 of them so don't give everybody if there's a family let you know like sister Rebecca and sister um whatever her name is let them watch I'm horrible sorry sister Anna it's just a it's just an uncommon name Anna that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel look in sanctification honor you're going to be possessed by something so let's be possessed by God all right you're going to be possessed by something we've read that many many times so let's go to Romans 12 be not conformed to this world but be what transformed by the renewing of your mind that what that you got to do something not just well I'm I'm here no you got to prove you're going to prove to Satan that you can live a Christian Life in this flesh body exemplary not an imagination not something that's in your head it's going to be something that is a reality brother brandham when he told those visions and when he told those people you're from so and so and your name is so and so and you live on so and so street that was not imagination even though that did come from his mind it was a vision that was true and it had materialized either before or after he either says I saw you in the doctor or he said I see you so he was projected either both ways backwards and forward and you know what it came to pass so that made him real how many times have we have though an imagination our mind and that thing never even come close to coming to pass they just didn't I had a dream the other night me and Thomas was doing something we he's been with us all week and we I don't know how this thing came together but I he was in a do truck Department of Transportation there was signs everywhere yield and stop and you know and then the then it went away well that dream I hope I don't know if he going to work for DT or not but that dream has it doesn't have a lot of validity I'm not going to put my I'm not going to put everything I got Thomas no don't do that you go dud don't be a do ain't nothing wrong being do but this we have dreams in the ination but this is not a dream and an imagination this is going to come to pass this will materialized it is already materialized in the mind of God so being that it materialized in the mind of God okay if you got any left over to you got something left over but then if anybody wants another copy you can have one it's going to be scriptures that we're going to read here in just a little while do not read it now read it in a little while but listen may you be transformed by the renewing of your mind listen the very life we live the very things that we say the very things that we do if we do it according to the word of God you will be different how many times have I told you that you're not going to say well I'm going to try to be different I don't want to be like the world no if you got the new birth you're heading in a direction to not be like the world cuz remember only the bride has the Holy Ghost only the bride has the New Birth we got to get to where it listen we got to get to a place to where God is going to separate us amen we're not if you try to separate yourself you just turn yourself away from God I believe but you just be who you are be the word of God for your day and you will be different Luther was the word of God for his day and he was different amen that's right Wesley all the great ones when you see those men when you see those men come out of the world what made them different they Doctrine they're preaching it made them different it put them in a book to where we could read a his history about somebody amen so that's the same way with me and you because remember brother R said if another book would be written it'd be another book of Acts all right and then we are written Epistles known and read of all men we are written in this Bible all the way from as the old black man said from K to ker we're all the way we're we the holy Bible made manifest not just well y'all live the Old Testament we live the new I've heard that before you know and so of you I believe it's all right to live in both right why are you excluding one of the other all right but you're going to prove what's a good and acceptable and perfect will of God Luke 8:45 and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter said they were with him said Master the multitude throng the impressed the and sayth who touched me Jesus said somebody ha touched me for I perceive that virtue that's that virtue on the pyramid has gone out of me I just want to read that to you because listen this afternoon if we get to it and we don't have any more questions there's a Time where that woman touched His Garment and she got something right there was a there was a contact right but now there was a time though that when a gentile Soldier walked up to Jesus and never touched him never got close to him and said whatever you say that's what will happen whatever you say I'm a man of authority you're a man of authority what happened was that virtue that dunamus or that power went from Jesus right to that person and he was healed it wasn't that the it wasn't that the the Centurion or or the he was a gentile Roman soldier that he had to have his hands laid on cuz you know what Jesus said the first thing if you we'll read it this afternoon maybe first thing Jesus said okay I'll go look how good Jesus was he okay I'll go and he said no I don't want you to go right you're a man of authority you don't in other words he he was a centurion he had 5200 men and he just give an order and he didn't have to go with the guy say all right come on you got to tell this guy right here no he gave the order he stayed where he was at and he sent that order or that power went with what the messenger and that messenger is gave the order but the power behind it was well who'd that come from that come from the C centu who'd that come that come from brother Brandon that come from Jesus Christ amen that's the authority and that's why I believe that brother random in the first part of his of his ministry remember it was not in the years of preparation it wasn't in the prayer lines it was that wasn't his message that was to get people to see that he was a Prophet to see that he was a messenger of God so when he became the messenger of God all that background we could say that ain't nothing but the truth just like hady R did and that's what we're trying to do now we're trying to say that ain't nothing but the truth not putting the man on a pedestal listen God's going to do that God will give him we don't give God will give him everything sir give him crowns and and we give him accolades here and and we give him reverence here but he's not our savior but we know where our savior got spoken like no other man he spoke about Jesus Christ than any other man on the face of this Earth nobody understood him nobody's going to understand you that's right we're just going to be an oddity to the world Listen the the world don't get born again like we do you understand what I mean right the world don't look like we do the world don't act like we do so look let God do the separating you don't have to walk in a room and like Dad always said I'm the preacher I need a nonsmoking you know you don't have no walk your daily life I promise you God or the devil want house you say something and help people get ill about it amen in the Statue of perfect man brother Bram said look that's the way it is to try to manufacture Christianity you can't do it the first thing you got to do is be born again all right so we've read this many times but I want that to sink in if you are not growing in virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience please say God save my soul Hallelujah because that's where it's got to come from it's going to come from that soul and Bloom out and if it what if it's dark it's going to bloom Darkness if it's light it's going to bloom light there is no in between there is no gray area there is no well I'll wait for a little while and and uh no no you've got to be changed right and when you're changed you become a new creation now you're getting right now you're getting right see now you don't have to worry about the feathers it'll take care of itself when you're born again yes sir now notice you must be born again that is what changed you there's got to be a change your body change started on the day you got born again that's right amen and if you don't continue on and you're still born again you will come to your body change it's just you're going to have to die right a a fleshly death to come back up in a resurrection and know what brother Brown said even about the foolish virgin they going to have to die give their life for the gospel and then come up into resurrection and be given eternal life I don't want to do that I want to get it here thank you thank you brother Dy he said I don't want to do that either I want to get it now you know why because that gives you a you know how we always played Monopoly you always love that one card that says pass go collect $200 or or pass jail you don't have to go to jail we want to pass that well there's one over there in the corner that says death there's one that says death I want that pass that says bypass bypass death and that's exactly we're in the game of life right well I want that card you've got it today it's called the baptism of the Holy Ghost and growing as brother Ram says in a few minutes that we just get started growing when we get born again not that we're already grown all right we're babies in Christ it's not bad to be a baby it's bad to stay a baby Romans or Hebrews 6 is therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ as we were talking now the other day let us go on into Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and a faith toward God see that's what had happened down through the church ages get Born Again live a good Christian Life die human death go over in the sixth dimension waiting for what waiting for the body change but somebody the Bible says according to Paul says we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of God trumpet is sounding then Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain will be changed all right so that's the part I want to say I don't and and and we got to get off this Foundation to come to a place where God can use us of the doctrine of baptism laying on of hands Resurrection the dead of Eternal judgment look and this will we do if God permit amen listen God sent an end time Messenger to permit you to do that amen he didn't just open the seal he opened the whole Bible he opened the whole way he was the porter he was the one that stood in the door and said hey come in it's for you I don't care about me it's for you this building for you that's right that's where you get to that selfishness brother Brandon was the most selfless not self selfish selfless person there ever was cuz everything he got he give it to us amen I like what brother Claude said one time brother Brown said one time he said I just can't keep a secret well thank God he didn't keep a secret what he kept was for him but what was for me and you he's just kept telling us and kept telling us even the angel said hey quit explaining it he said well you know what he was saying in his mind they're babies they got to understand what I'm saying cuz the angel said look just tell them and if they don't like it don't worry about it but he was a human being and he had what the most unselfish motive in the world is to get a people ready Ephesians 4:11 said he gave some Apostles and then what did he do he give it to me and you he didn't keep it to himself he gave it some Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers what for the Perfection of the Saints amen for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ look till we all come to the unity of faith we can't do that brother way well the Bible says we can amen the Bible says we will all right and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and that's what this is behind me it's the stature of Christ the fullness that we henceforth be no more children right babies amen amen I I want us to realize when we say something that brother brandham said it's like brother Dale said he always said he said Paul said if I become your enemy because I told you the truth the truth of the matter is brother R says every time you come to the altar you get weaker you want me to bring you that quote I've already read it two or three times here the more you come to the altar the weaker you get I'm just telling you what he said why we need to grow up not be children every little thing no pray yourself go to God yourself you know why don't you don't go to God yourself cuz you're not right somewhere oh sorry didn't mean to hurt your feelings but look tossed to and fro and carried away with every wind of Doctrine you see people leave and they come back leave and they come back look by the slide of men preachers preachers where'd you get your Doctrine somebody told you that from the pulpit where'd you get to where you can cut your hair out in the world the preacher behind the pull pit said a that's just Old Testament stuff we're living in the New Testament he needs to read his Bible cuz it's in the New Testament about her hairs or glory amen by the slide of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and weight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him in all things which is the head even Christ for whom also the whole body fitly joined together and compacted I told brother Joe we was coming praying just a few minutes ago I said I'm just glad everybody got together back together I don't like it when the body scatters I scattered and all different one you know Aaron and they were scattered not scattered sheep well maybe but we scatter but we come back and you come back together and it's like it's safety with sheep there's safety in numbers what does Satan do he tries to cut one of you what cut one of you out of the herd you watch a you watch go watch a document of lions and tigers and different ones they'll find one weak they'll find one that's limping just a little bit they'll find one that kind of gets away from the herd a little bit guess what that's the one they go after so that's the one Satan sends the hounds of Hell after is that one that's kind of separated herself out somewhere else I don't know where that came from but it was worth something for him the whole body fly joined together and compacted today we're compacted Back Together by that which every joint supplies according to effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body into the edifying of itself in love and we see that we we're not got to that Son of Man part yet we're right here where it says the Son of God we now have the new birth we now are starting with what the faith of God he's given it to you so now it's your faith yes everybody with me it's your faith all right brother Brown said this is my eye God gave it to me so because it says add to your faith didn't say add to God's faith it said add to your faith add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance of the Son of God so now we're off of that we got to get off that foundation and we will and he said unto them if any come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross it's just something I want to remind you remember this is a cross bearing group of people am amen it's not somebody that you give it to the pre preacher and you give it to you know brother brandham or you give it to the priest and well they'll carry it for me no you got to carry your own cross and it might be rough that old cross you know it's called an Old Rugged Cross for a reason they didn't sit there and shine it up like this right here no they heed it out of a round log and it probably had splinters long sticking out of it and that's the way it is with me and you you me and you in life I'm sorry that may not be deep but this is life lesson for whosoever will save his life shall lose it there we go with selfishness but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same will save it then Paul tells us that you need to Die daily there's something in your life that needs to die every day 365 demons needed to die in your life must less mine in somebody else's life all right and I like this scripture I've come to learn it a little bit more for so is the will of God that with well-doing with wello doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men listen you don't have to say you're foolish and you're ignorant just live the life you're going to like I said you're going to be different you're going to be contrary you're going to think different you're going to act different you're going to talk different so you put you'll put the silence the ignorance of foolish man they'll come a time when those foolish virgins foolish men are going to come to who to get oil the ones that have it they're not going to go back to the denomination and try to get it come on somebody they're going to what come to somebody they think they knows God it and that's got to be the bride amen for so is the will of God with well-doing you may put to silence how are we going to put the silence the ignorance of foolish men we are going to what come to this what now we've got to come to full Doctrine full Doctrine not just part full Doctrine I like good shouting meetings I do too where we just clap our hands and shout and have a good time there's a place for all that have great powerful services and things dance on the bubble as it were but what is he saying he said all right come back here though but wait then when The Showdown time comes that's when you and the devil are toe to- toe and you don't have that atmosphere you don't have that bubble dancing you don't have that uh anointing that that makes you feel good it just gets you all warm no you may be outside on the back side of a desert somewhere like Jesus was by himself for 40 days didn't have nothing to eat or drink that was kind of a miracle you can't live without so many days without water amen Bible said he didn't have bread or water but wait then when The Showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing right come on you went out and had a good time in a meeting that was good that was shouting that was whatever speaking in tongues you got hands laid on you got prayed for same way we're talking about we're going to talk about that a little bit about youth camps tonight but you got to know where you're standing at your home Church your day to day your home wherever you're living at where you're working at you got to know where you're standing let's go back and find out let's find out what's making us do that let's get back to the foundation see where we're at that's what we're doing now we want the open book but have we we got all our eyes open preach it somebody all we living that open book brother we got a open book we open book well are both of our eyes open are we living that open book because you know what if it was closed you can have a little bit of ignorance and you'll get by with it cuz the book's closed right right but if that book's open and you have full access yeah what's your excuse full access to everything that God's give us and it's not just an imagination it's not a Doctrine it's not something you're thinking about no it's the word of God yes amen we'll read it tonight Bible says cast down imagination we got to do that now look it says it's easy to feel the power of God to see when you believe but when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have we in time bride we're uh and you hear it all over the the message we're we're in the message of the son of man well they don't even can't even get the Son of God right most of them they make him a tuness or they make him a two Soul seven Thunder virtue they make him this they make him what God to the River Jordan come on people are you able to possess the thing that you profess to have that's the thing brother we've got to get it you've got to take it it's yours but you'll fight for every inch of it so it's a fight remember it's a battles ship not a cruise ship I love going cruise ships they're just really nice but boy could you imagine being in a battleship in the middle of a battle you got all them guns blaring and you got somebody with a 50 caliber doing this and you got uh airplanes diving trying to kill you Devil's trying to kill you but God has given you the equipment we're gonna talk about a little bit later on there is no way that the United States of America is going to send their soldiers to war with a toothpick that's right and a and a and a butter knife and just a loin cloth no they going to put everything and they can on him they're going to train him for every how many weeks a lot of you have been in the military you know they didn't just brother Dar they say oh you're in the military here you need to go fight no you die the first day so God has equipped us for this battle before the battle even begins we're all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is Tried by the word he's tried by the word he's not tried by your enemy that's right he's tried by the word of God to see if you'll be loyal to it there loyal well I think I might well I think I might not no you got to be loyal to it when The Showdown comes what decision are you going to make that's it he that cannot stand chastisement but goes on with the world he's an illegitimate child come on and not a son and daughter of God certainly not but the spiritual minded we're talking about mind today the spiritual minded catches the word lines up with it sister hady r that ain't nothing but the truth and the spirit comes down under the shed blood and takes that person come on take me Lord yes that's what you ought to say this morning take me Lord wherever you going to take me take me amen amen Paradox 1964 I like this quote some of you giggled at it and so did I when I first read it but it's very true it was a paradox when the Hebrew children was thrown into the fiery furnace how that three men could walk into a furnace so hot that the intense heat even kill the men that were pushing them in and yet they stayed in that it only delivered them now I's going to explain it that's the only thing it did see it delivered them from the bounds that they were bound with it was a paradise you understand what he's saying they thought it was going to be the end of their life they were bound up with chains or whatever it was didn't matter it was feeds and they were doing this and they were heading toward this thing it was a glowing red hot and they probably could feel the heat at one time but all of a sudden there was a cool breeze went by there was a cool breeze went by and they just said all right we're good walked right on in and they watched the they watched the Rope brother John at that hot it just disintegrated those ropes turned them to ashes so what bound them the situation they were in the hotness of the battle or the or the heat of the oven is what delivered them now that's what's going to deliver me and you the heat of the battle is what's going to deliver me in you sometimes in our own lives that Paradox repeats sometimes you're brought to a showdown where you have to make a decision listen God's going to make us make a decision whether it's the foolishness of preaching or where if you hear it from Brother random or you read it in the Bible you're going to come to a place to where you're going to have to make a decision you have to stand on that decision though like they did and it all works together for the good what did it do it never hurt them it loosed them that's right the battle that you fought should loose you not hurt you cuz if we're children of God we're going to be put into situations by God that's right right by God that's right to try you I just read that quote to try you oh Abraham go kill your son the one I gave you by promise go kill him and he didn't just do it in an instant he had he made Isaac get the wood they traveled so many miles Isaac put the wood on his shoulder he said no we're going to make a sacrifice today we're going we're going to try to get to church Abraham says we'll be back in a little while me and the boy look at the faith me and the boy are going to go worship and me and the boy will bring our amen body change that's what you got to look at there was a change when Abraham went up there he was going to kill that guy which was his son that's right and he come down and when he come down that angel went and what what did what did the Bible say the Bible says God said now I know now God all knowing god knew before the foundation of the world now I know Abraham that you're my son you're my child no well we know that was what he said but what he was really saying was Abraham you know you know what you are and what you're going to be he let Abraham know sometimes we're caught in that position first thing you got to do like the man drowning in the river you got to get the man out of the river before you can get the river out of the man come on yeah that's something what a man has to do it comes out and makes him stand get the thing out and get him out of the thing so he can get the thing out of him that's what we're looking at we you say I don't have a demon in me well that's the first demon you need to get out everybody with me you need to get the lion devil off of you first everybody with me if I hurt you feeling sorry but we all we all have demon everybody's got them it's just how you handle them everybody with me look now there's a perfect way listen to this there's a perfect way and a permissive will we know that all right there's a perfect way God wants to do and there's a permissive will he'll allow you to go this way just to show you that he's boss all right and I feel that if God here on the platform I listen to this can show me things that has been and in my rooms and so forth now what he talking about he's talking about private interviews remember he had private interviews they come in and and God would actually answer the question before the people would get there said oh I got four questions brother BR said okay ask them and brother BR would take out a sheet of paper and say look here's your answer God's already told me the question now what is that that's the mind of God that can't be the mind of man so it had to be that build your faith to believe that brother R was a mouthpie of God he was and had the mind of Christ that's what Paul said we had to have a long time ago can show me things that has been in my rooms and so forth he's able to tell me just where he wants me and what he wants me to do look how submissive but I feel as long as I've got it all hooked up watch this I feel like then he won't put his hand on it as long as I'm doing it wow wow watch this right here and that's the way it is with anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them oh that hurt God can't fight your battle I'm going read it one more time if someone talks about you and you talk back about them what that's that selfish thing he said this about me so I'm going to say this about him God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself everybody with me I want this to cut but cut real good look just let loose and let him do it and just commit it to him that's what we've been doing commit our kids to God commit our wayward people to God just say put them and listen whatever happens don't put your hand back on it amen amen come on take your hand off amen oh it's going to be rough long as they make it that's right fine with me look the greatest weapon that I know of a Christian today is a committal to God everybody believe brother rown was a prophet all on this side does and this side doesn't well a few up here in the front I'm sorry those in the back are asleep the greatest weapon that I know of of a Christian today is a committal to God committed to God cuz you know what we do we get our mind involved and we go through our memory Reon conscious faction imagination and think this is the way we want it done oh hold on a minute I'm sorry this is the way God ought to do it the almighty omnipotent I'm the present omnicient Eternal we're trying to tell them how to do it yeah the greatest weapon so listen you got to have weapons cuz we're going to end a battle brother B we're going to talk about right here the greatest battle ever fought is a what a committal to God what a soldier does is he when he commits himself to the Army like brother Donnie and some of you that that were in service you committed yourself to an army that's supposed to be the best not the worst but you committed yourself that the United States would stand behind you and give you the best equipment made well what about this Army that we've got into now this Army of God if if America can equip their if America can equip and give them everything they need what about God Amen he already knows how the battle's going to go he already knows what equipment you need to get through the battle we're just guessing America's just guessing that's why America's going to get blown off the map that's we're just guessing when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it everybody with me greatest battle ever fought here was kind of my thought I was thinking on this other day if we need a mental adjustment and that that phrase comes up that it's all in your head so watch what happened so it's an Army first in getting ready for a battle first there's got to be look select some soldiers not just everybody remember there's a process when you go up there they check your eyes they check your ears they check your nose they check your your joints they check how many of you been in the military okay well real recently um Sister Mary back there but you go through this thing and they start and I look it doesn't make you inferior but they weed out they want the best right if you can't see you're not going to be a pilot disaster right that's why I said people you're the best of the best if you got the new birth if you got the new birth he's changed every bit of that he's brought you up to what first in line yes amen he's weeded out all the rest he's brought you up put you first in line give you the best equipment The Shield the sword the come on somebody some soldiers select they've got to be dressed for fighting not for a picnic you dress a whole lot different to get on a battleship than you do a cruise ship yeah somebody you've got to be trained for fighting and I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought is now 1962 311 19602 almost exactly one year before the seals were preached in 1963 in March he's telling them to get ready for a battle oh he fought many B listen what about a prophet that stood and he fought many battles 300,000 people got saved hundreds of of people got healed all these different things now now he said the Bible just now getting ready to be fought wow he knew that it would become spiritual and it would become that not everybody could make it cuz look is now ready to go into action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start where is it brother brandom there has to be a place selected you know they had to select the place for the Battle of Gettysburg they had to select even there's a select place for the battle of Armageddon but people select places you just don't go in and start F fighting randomly no you pick your place you pick your battle you pick your spot well the greatest battle ever fought we know where it's at in our mind that's why we're going to talk about it here just for a few minutes if that's all right there has to be a place selected and this look there's a mutual ground both parties Mutual ground no man's land and they fight here at this place they just don't one fight over here and one down over here and one run over here there's a battlef front where they meet and test their powers where each Army test its strength against the other Army a mutual meeting place now look he said I don't miss this when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battle Ground begins in the human mind not this not how much you can how much human knowledge or human Temperance or human virtue you have is how much God knowledge God Temperance God patience you have and that battle begins in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where it was begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind the head now they never started it from some organization they never started it from some mechanical Affair the grounds never started there therefore that organization can never never do the works of God that's right because the battlegr where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind yes amen you've got to make your choice it meets you yes right you got to make a choice now let's look that's what the phrase it's all in your head oh man come on that's all in your head what do you mean that's all it's all in your head it's all you it's all in your head let me read you this now you've got your we're going to read scriptures I want you to read I'm going to read this to you what does it's all in your head mean all right Shake Yourself wake up just a little bit look at least look alive some of you ought to paint eyeballs on the back of your eyelid so you I think you're awake that'd be putting on makeup wouldn't it now the only thing listen we know that the body is weak the flesh but but as a minister of the gospel and the others that come here and preach it just it tears at our heart that this doesn't excite you and you let that override it's just like going to sleep at a what who in the world would go to sleep at a ball game how many of you have ever seen ESPN has not lived by this right touchdown no the dude's got on his Garb he's got on his Sunday v he's got his favorite team tattooed across his chest it's 12 below zero and he's naked right please don't try that amen but listen folks it's what you enjoy listen I enjoy watching ball games I do but it's on my time not God's time all right look now look the meaning of it comes from your head this from the internet so it must be true it's imaginary made up psychosomatic while it indeed is from your head it imply it's implied that it was created by your mind not that it's from your brain it's from your psyche listen it's not uncommon for people to say this about diagnosis conditions ill illnesses that don't have visible or physical symptoms hey dude it's all in your head listen another meaning if something is all in your head you have imagined it and it's not real think about that I love the quote one time because you know what we get all we get all nervous and been out of shape we think people's talking about us all the time come on somebody we think we think all my free to yeah I see her she's over whispering to Paul cuz I got something on my nose or something you know something my hair's not right or something that's back some them kids back there they Whispering about me cuz I'm ugly well that's true me ugly you free of me not at all when they're not even talking about you one second a psychologist said one time he said you spend about 80% of your time listen to this 80% of your time worrying about what somebody's saying about you when that person don't spend 2% of their time thinking about you amen right brother klie I got too many problems of my own I well I have to deal with some of y'all in this position I'm in for the temporary moment but we've got to get it out of our head into our heart because we got to have the mind of christl and the greatest battle is up here so is the Battle of it's me and you the Battle Is Us not like I said you're not going to make it you're not not going to make it a preacher is not going to make you not make it or make it you're going to inivision that you going we need guidance we need help don't don't all go home we need that but your choice in your mind that's what you got to make up whether you want to what raise your hand scream when you want to scream shout when you want to shout right let's read these let's read these here in the Bible just a little bit and then we'll we'll stop right here I wanted to get to something else but we'll stop we'll get to it next Sunday or this afternoon look at the Bible in Genesis 6:5 and God saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth and listen he doesn't list prostitution he doesn't list what does he list one thing that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually it came from right here and then they did what they did because of what they were thinking remember stinking thinking Genesis 8: 21 and the Lord smelled a sweet Savor and the Lord said in his heart I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake for the imagination remember we got to cast that down memory reason conscious affection imagin ation that's part of the five senses in that Spirit realm the Lord smelled a sweet saver and the Lord said in his heart I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will I again Smite anymore everything living as I have done he's talking about the flood Jeremiah 7:23 said but this thing commanded I them saying obey my voice and I will be your God and you shall be my people and walk in all the ways of I have commanded you that it may be well unto you but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked Walked walked through life they walked what look at that in the counsel and in the imagination of their evil heart and went backwards not forward come on Amen nothing good about this is going to happen nothing keep going everybody with me amen Matthew 15: 19 for for out of the heart proceede evil thoughts murders adultery fornication thefts false witness blasphemies things you think of in your mind Luke 2:35 and I wrote us a note here yeah a sword shall pierce through my own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed that's this age that's why brother R could stand and say I see you were at a somewhere yesterday and you said a bad word and you need to get that straightened out why he was looking right at it he was looking at not an imagination they can call him whatever they want to call him he was not an imaginary Prophet that's right he was a mouthpiece of God and God spoke to him used his lips and told you your problems just like he's doing the same thing now hallu out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornication thefts false witness blasphemies Luke 2:35 is what we're talking about now the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed how is that by the opening of the word amen amen Romans 1:20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse watch because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God I'll give you an example that just in a few minutes neither were thankful but become what vain in their imaginations listen every false Doctrine is an imagination it did not come from God everybody with me God has no imagination right right he don't imagine things and they don't come to pass no he thinks it they come to pass so we wait a minute back up here everybody wake up we got to have that same mind that's right we got to have the mind of Christ mind of Christ has no imagination in it that's why we're going to read in a minute cast down imagination that's our problem and really it is it's an issue that I see y'all have and I have we think too much about whatever the people think about us amen you need to worry about St but became vain in their imaginations look and their foolish heart was darkened there ain't nothing good with that folks nothing good with that nothing their foolish heart was darkened 2 Corinthians 10 but I beseech you that I may not be bold oh let me back up here to Romans 1 verse2 because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God we were coming to it's kind of strange how God works well it's not strange to him it's strange to us here we go imagining things we never listen to 106.1 because we usually listen to The Fish I'm just I'm laying it all on the altar r105 K love everybody I know y'all do cuz you sing the songs that was on it but 106 secret centers but we listened it was it was on 106.1 cuz George game was on yesterday on that station but they played gospel music southern gospel music for like an hour on 1061 up here in cornelus some of you already listen well we were listening to it coming up the road and I was thinking on this very thing about the imagination mind all different things and they sang that song Liar Liar talking about the devil being a liar but they just don't know they're being deceived yes by that same lie do you see the deception they're singing The Very songs by inspir oparation they know Satan's a liar but he's got them believe in his lie yes and we believe it to a degree till we get it all knocked out of us but that's how deceiving that is because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God Amen what is the great deception Satan sitting in the temple of God come on right showing himself to be as God in this age yes and they sing the songs and they're condemning their own self thinking that they're what that they oh well the devil's over there cuz I'm singing about him over there liar liar and then they go to church and the preacher stands up and says well we're going to baptize you today in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost so we love this Blessed Trinity that's a lie of the devil folks lie they're living a lie but they think they're living the truth now I just feel sorry for them I'm not trying to kick the guy out but when I was listening to that song I thought my god do you remember do you remember brother Brown said when they when they hung Jesus on the cross the very word himself they hung Jesus on the cross right they were in the temple singing The Very songs about that and they're the ones that put him on the cross and they're singing to get the Messiah here they're singing these songs from the Psalms and from the songs of Solomon they're singing The Very songs that's condemn in them right come on people that's how close it is that's how we can't have we got to cast down imagination but I beseech you for 2 Corinthians 10 that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence look wherewith I think to be bold against some right don't C don't put people down which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh now keep reading for though we walk in the flesh come on we don't walk by the flesh We Walk In the Flesh we do not war after the flesh it's not your flesh's fault how many times can I get that in your head quit blaming your flesh now it's that Spirit that's motivating your flesh for the weapon of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds look casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted what itself itself against the knowledge of God that's right which is what the truth that's right and look and bringing into captivity every thought Yes To The Obedience of Christ am amen thank you Lord read that one more time casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity yes I want to be a prisoner I want to be a prisoner yes sir you know what a prisoner has no rights prisoner locked up prisoner has no rights Paul said it 100 times in the old in the New Testament Paul a prisoner of Christ Paul a prisoner in my bonds I glory in my bonds bringing into captivity every thought Yes To The Obedience of Christ wow you need to post that on your fridge instead of the something from James Dobson just saying just saying it's all in your head let's stand it's all in your head thank is it sure that's where it's got to start but as a man thinketh in his heart so is he that goes down into the soul yes but has to come back through that filter of your what of your gray matter your five senses your brain that's right everybody with me on that cast down yes we need a mental object a mental adjustment but it has to be by the word of God not by what our own look right there selfishness lovers of their own self I don't want to live for myself a selfish life I want to live for others and give that strength I have not to myself but to the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of God talk about our own selfish being our own ambition if we could completely surrender oursel and be yolked to him what prisoner be yoke to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks I do not care what the world thinks about me whatever you lead I'll follow Lord I'll be a prisoner see wow then you have to suffer to rain listen the Bible says the present suffering of this time cannot be compared to in other words let me let me interpolate to the eternal life that we have that's right everything you see in your human life has an end except eternal life everything Hallelujah everything has an end everything's getting older amen everything's getting wore out but if you'll suffer you'll Reign because character is a victory not a gift it's not something God gives out and he gives gifts gifts of healing Gifts of Prophecy Gifts of different things but you got to suffer to get character cuz character what character was not the character was inside of you was your own nature when you get that out of you you still got what you got a lot of things you got to get out of you cuz a man Man Without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but but Power with character is fit to rule and that's what God wants he wants number one oh I wish he'd rule over my neighbor I wish he'd rule over my preacher or my song leader no he needs you need to get yourself ruled over first when you get yourself into subjection amen when I get myself into subjection then what then God's going to work power with character yeah it's fit to rule you love the lord it's all in your head it's got to start there don't let it stay there if the three Hebrew children would have what if they would have leaned toward their human imagination and human emotion you know what they do oh we really we'll we'll bow don't don't worry we we got no their resolve was I don't care live or die sink or swim I'm heading toward the problem everybody all of us have got problems head toward it not away from it amen head toward the problem not away from it cuz if you're a child of God you got to go through it but when you get on the other side you look back and say it was all for me it just broke me out of the bonds that I was in that's why you got to look at all of it let's sing a song God bless you there's River of flowing out from me make the lame to walk and the blind to see open prison do set the captive free oh there the River of Life flowing out from me bring up where's he got to come from in your soul bring up all well and make me whole bring up all well and give to me what that life abundantly sing it oh
