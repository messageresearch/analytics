of that will be taken care of you know all of you gone to remember that remember brother al he's having a lot of problems so brethren Lord would bless with him okay all right revelations that we're still on the point it's going to be hard to try to connect it to the resurrection but we're on the point of all things new and maybe we can get it together into a point at the end of the message but he says in Revelation 21:1 and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away there was no more seat and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he said and he that set up on the throne said behold behold I make all things new and he said write for these words are true and faithful he said unto me it is done I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his son and he shall be I will be his God and he shall be my son you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word I said it's going to be a when odd connection to try to bring because remember we've been talking about I'll make all things new all right now we're going to see if we can tie that in with a point of this time of the year of the resurrection because today we honor the resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and believing that he will make all things possible unto us and you know we'll we'll be at that point but I want you to think now for a little bit with me of here where we're in John to read this and then just think about it see if you see if you can pull it together with with the right point you know okay let's go to John 11 verse 20 then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming when it met him but Mary said still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus if thou had us been here my brother had not died now listen to this statement but I know that even now whatsoever that's wilt ask of God God will give it thee now don't forget that don't forget that thought because it'll be the main point of our message when we get to it because look what Jesus turning spoke to her jesus saith unto her thy brother shall live again now they believed in a resurrection you had your Pharisees and Sadducees and you'll even hear brother Branham mention that you know like the Sadducees one of them believed in the resurrection another one didn't maybe you've heard that down through time of what's been doing but just remember it's it's not saying it the way we think it's saying it because you know the Sadducees they believed in the resurrection but not in the resurrection like the Pharisees bleed see one was looking more ice to a resurrection the other was just looking well it'll be over with gone will do and whatever or one of these days were going because don't think that the Sadducees thought death ended every time why would you want to be in any form of Christianity or serve God if you didn't have a place to go to when you die are you listening don't know don't think that they were sad because they didn't have no resurrection they believed the old man kind of always believed joke you know he said I know that my redeemer see everybody has believed in a resurrection but it's according to how you believe it well now that's the thought today how do you believe the resurrection you know how do how are you connected to it so think about it now jesus saith unto her thy brother shall live again see know what she believed in the resurrection because she said Martha saith unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day as she believed in a resurrection right she believed they would be a resurrection because basically man believed that all right but what's the answer and jesus saith unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this and watch she saith unto Him because now she had already now listened with me she had already declared when Jesus was there and met her she said if you had have been here my brother wouldn't have died she believed that there was enough connection to that right now watch her next statement she said but now I know that even now whatever you ask God whatever you ask God he'll give you because you've seen that over and over and over right so now look at the point you follow me she declares if you'd have been here my brother wouldn't have died she had enough confidence in her thoughts and things of life that she believed that Jesus was something great but did she have it in the correct order no because she says now if you'd have been here he wouldn't have died that's a good statement all right now he's dead well what's he gonna do she said but now I believe - then whatever you ask him whatever you ask God he'll do did she have her thoughts in the right channel do we have our thoughts in the right channel I think with me I said it'll it'll tie together the Lord willing I know that he shall rise again see I thought over her all of her statements were in good State good points she believed in a resurrection at the last days and she believed in okay if you don't raise him then he'll raise in the last day because she believed in the resurrection that's what I'm saying don't think the Sadducees because you'd think that they were sad because they didn't believe it was the way the resurrection was taught among the Pharisees and Sadducees that made the difference between what they were thinking because that's what I'm trying to get you to see marry her Martha she says yes Lord yeah I believe in the resurrection and I believe Lazarus will come up in the resurrection now jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life now do you believe in a resurrection do you believe yes we believe there'll be a resurrection yes there's going to be a resurrection but we would we believe him if he was standing here today to say I am the resurrection or would we be believing in a resurrection now get this statement believing in a resurrection is not the all of Christianity now before this incident happened there had been many people raised from the dead right Alijah raised from the dead what about Jesus and the little girl that was and he told him he said she's asleep in hell life because she is dead are you following me is it just to believe that a resurrection is possible or do we really know for sure 'ti who this is is talking because now remember reading scripture she said lord if you'd have been here Lazarus wouldn't have died she kind of had that confidence that faith built that he could contact someone else right she said yeah and said I know what have confidence in the fact of the way it's been around here and what's happened in the deads been raised six been healed the things that has happened in your ministry that even now if you're asking God will come on the same Jesus said to her I am the resurrection what was he saying she was given the point that whatever God would deal with or tell him he'd go do if God told him to go raise Lazarus he'd go raise Lazarus right he said Martha I am the resurrection see they heard him say before Abraham was I am they heard him say I am the bread in the wilderness right but when he says at this time look what he said he said I am the resurrection I am what you have need of you got a brother that's dead you've made some good statements about me but do you realize Who I am you realize that what he wasn't doing at this situation was relating to Martha who he was that he was the God of the Old Testament he was the one that was at the burning bush that Moses said what by what name he said I am that I am we want to make the talk a lot of times about I am as me and I am and all of that but do you realize Martha wasn't talking about that she believed God could do these things because remember that's what she said even now whatever you ask god what a bold statement is going back into the face of a person that is looking for something - oh god some were to try to raise the dead and Jesus could have declares it has not the dead been raised as think the heel has not these things taking place and see what it said yes but what a surprise was when he said I am the resurrection he was declaring himself to be the same god of the burning bush you'll find it in acts 7 I think it is where it says this is that one that was in the bush in the wilderness who who is that one read up and down what you're reading there in the book of life you'll find this the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ was in that burning bush not as a human element not as a man or 16 element body etc he was there as to be who he was and in Clark I am the resurrection he was declaring himself to her as to be God she was looking for a God her statement showed that we believe even now whatever you ask God whatever you ask God you go talk to God and come back and we believe Lazarus erasing the dead he said I am the resurrection he said I'm the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I'm the one that was at the burning bush I sent humans last madnes come on but the very God that was inside of that human man standing that we call Jesus was in the burning bush as the Almighty God do we believe him like that is resurrection to you and I looking for something to come a day to time a season a point what would Jesus say if he's standing here today do you understand what I'm getting at it looks like Martha made some great statements and they were great she was declaring that he could do those things that God working through him could manifest all these things but he simply says to Martha nieces what are you looking for a God somewheres else you want me to go talk to God for you so that's what you're declaring me to do but he said I am the resurrection is there anything that could have a stood in the way to keeping Lazarus from raising from the dead it would look good enough in Martha's confession her confession was we've seen this we know it can be done we've seen what you've done in your ministries enough now just ask God the Lazarus will rise he said I don't know how to ask God said I am God you just don't recognize that you're looking at something else he said but for one time look straight at me he said I am the resurrection see he was showing who he was to Martha and she still couldn't follow it right as this message brought to us a head knowledge I remember in the Baptist Church I used to read the Bible and and think about why would those fire scenes kill the Lord Jesus for all he done being good you'll remember reading like that I read the Bible that's not a trying to find us talking to somebody the other day about this so you try to find something you're looking over what you're reading read the Bible read the prophets message anyway instead of trying to find some key some point some great revelation I remember when they love you remember when they they finally it they found 24 believe it was on the tape sit in the back somewhere around the seventies I guess well everybody just flooded them to get those 24 tapes because they thought that's gonna get some secret though these things has been hid all these year and we will get some secret now what to do everybody's always looking for some kind of a something to happen looking for a resurrection when we're gonna stop looking for the resurrection and start looking after resurrect he said I am the resurrection that right there was a statement that connected the entire Bible together to who this man really is he said before Abraham was I am well they realized you know that he was saying something so they said well you're a man not over 50 and you claim you seen Abraham I'm just trying to get you think about something about the resurrection thinking about the resurrection instead of thinking about what it is or trying to find it as I said read the Bible don't read it as trying to find some secret coded word I never seen that before I remember back in the seventies part of you remember not old enough to remember a lot of these doctrines that went forth in the message but you know there was a lot of things statements made and like that to try to to show you that they were looking for some secret coded keys you know something we hadn't found before work what if he found secret coded keys you know they claim the Bible can be broke down into two different many different sects and different cults you've read about him what did that bring Christ see that's what Martha was doing she was looking for something she was saying if you hadn't been here this wouldn't happen but said now it's happened we said now I know and believe that you have look enough connection to God that if you'll ask him what didn't she say we know who you are speak the word she didn't have that much she had a great understanding was she now that much she was still looking for somebody to try to help her do something Jesus said I am the resurrection I'm the god of the word now if you don't get nothing out of the message today get this much Jesus didn't say I hope I am maybe I am or maybe a wheel or maybe this will take place whatever he said I am the resurrection he was very positive about what he said you know he knew back three or four days before then remember whether the disciples in the running up to that period of time and they called for him and trying to get him to come and everything and he finally turned around and told him he said look boys let's go he said I want you to know because they kept saying well and he said you know Lazarus sleep well if he's sleeping he's doing pretty good oh that's the best flower him you know let him sleep awhile he said look I'm trying to tell you Lazarus is dead I'm going to raise him now if there's Bibles riding your prophet says he never done nothing till he's seen it so he's already seen Lazarus raised so he didn't have no problem he wouldn't go at hoping or guessing her thinking it and he wasn't putting it back on Martha's confession he had his own when are you getting that I'm getting it a positive attitude when are we gonna start doing that so we're looking for gimmicks and looking for thoughts I don't look for those things I don't look for a secret coated thing I read the Bible to see what it says because it's that's what it means and it means what it says so why am I looking for secret coded outfits somewhere certain words some thoughts will not take what it says yeah but I just can't understand I come down through there - I can remember when I was in the Baptist Church and studying trying to study the Word of God because see I had that kind of an idea and you know what I started doing I started then reading the Bible on the basis of reading it to see what it said not what somebody taught me that it said I like to get the definitions of words if you take my Bible and read it you'll find a lot of definitional words in there you know places were that I couldn't figure out that definition of what that was meaning so I went in the Webster's and got it and wrote down the definition did you know what I wound up doing reading what it said when brother Dale I've read brother runs matching but I just can't see that can't see what the Bible has never declared but one true and living God and never declared a Trinity or anything like that right it was God speaking to us well why don't we read it that way the Prophet never came to change the book to change a word everything right well we just didn't know this we didn't know that come on it's about time we get off with some of our play pretty parties and get down to listening to the truth God said unless you believe that I am he know that what Jesus said that Oh see but if you get it correctly you'll say that he said unless you believe that I'll a who Jesus so Jesus was God no he was a second Berta he was ever see what I mean we've spent all of our lives trying to figure out what the Bible said when all we had to do was read it where did your prophet change the wording of the Bible he says that the ends and the box is in the right place we don't have a Bible according to William Branham we have the Word of God the Prophet come to tell us to believe what it said read simple what we just read Martha Mary they said word to Jesus trying to tell him hey Lazarus is dead and he just goes the other way he waits longer and longer remember the story of prophet told it finally he comes back and when they see him what is it no don't we know Jesus we know that Lazarus is dead I said we were hoping that if you be here he wouldn't have died I said now I've got enough confidence in you cause I've seen it happen before that you'd ask God and God would do it see they never looked at him as being God they looked at him as a possibility of contacting God that's what I'm getting at are you following me and what I'm trying to get you to see instead of seeing who he was and determining when he said I am the resurrection well maybe he's resurrection I don't know maybe we can do this maybe we do that maybe we can find this you have we've seen these things honesty you see what I'm talking about he spoke very positive and he said I am the resurrection in other words he declared I'm the same God that spoke to Moses from the burning bush I was in the burning bush read the book of Acts the seventh chapter and you'll find it it talking of the Lord Jesus Christ being there who do you think that was now not the human flesh the god that was dwelling in the flesh was Almighty God and he was trying to tell Mary said Mary and Martha said Martha few just look you had your confidence built in me on the basis that things could happen with me being around I said I want you to know I'm trying to get you to see who I am there wasn't no problem with the resurrection that's what I'm trying to get you to see they had already had the dead raised right the dead had done been raised but to find out the hughster of man there was so positive in his statement at least said I am the resurrection and we got it to that point yet they listen if you're following the point of what I'm getting at then follow to another step the date had been raised the Sikh had been healed before the Lord Jesus made that statement am i right okay but you know what your prophet said one day he said all of those things was great but he said on that day of the resurrection he proved who he was now Mariah the Lord Jesus when he raised proved who he was he proved to them that he was the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob we did accepted he proved to them that he was the God and the burning bush because nobody can raise the dead except God he proved who he was by his own resurrection right he proved who he was by his own resurrection by raising that body did he tell them destroy this body in three days I'll raise it up did it happen are you following me they had their hopes in that this man had some connection with God but they didn't have their hopes in the fact that he was God he was a connecting link to a God that could help them what about you is that all you've got see Jesus had a positive attitude he said I am the resurrection when are we going to become positive in our thinking he said I am the resurrection and one day you say the Dead was raised to sick with heal Lazarus was raised up everything they didn't catch it right they didn't catch on to it and he winds up having to tell him when he raised the scripture says about him you know that he opened their understanding of the scriptures about himself that was before Pentecost now that was before the holy ghost guy there's two times our that it says he opened their understanding of the scripture of who he was but where were they had on the day of Pentecost running like everything scared to death because they didn't see him to be who he was Peter had this great confession yes dark the Christ the Son of the Living God read on through with Martha Martha declares him to be the Christ the Son of God Peter had all of that but yet when the scripture began to be fulfilled that he was going through all those things worst Peter running right follow me and what I'm saying the dead raised the sick heal all that's great but now you can believe this or doing she won't do it I don't care that never attracted my attention when I began to study this message brother mote said we've seen the sick healed we've seen the dead raised we've seen all of these things named people that was there that we would have personal understanding of who they were remembered the tatom's in a different one and I told him I said brother mode I wasn't there you saw those things but I wasn't dark I'm believing you but I'm telling you you tell me what this man taught and I'll know whether he was a prophet or not and he's where do you want to believe it that way that's up to you that's what took place thank God I run into a man that wasn't just boy blessed God you got to believe this got to believe that you know I walked into a man that would tell me the Bible said it and read it to me I loved that brother mote was the type of person he always did it we rode the country with books and everything and I did because I had this memory so much of the colors of the book still brother mote would call out future home and I'd get him a blue book hand it to him or a green one for this one we traveled if he ever said brother branham believed in one God he read it now you that was there with him you know that's true if he said brother Branham believed that he read it that's where I learned that from it's hard to argue with somebody when they're telling you exactly what the man says that's why I'm not scared on the Internet ain't you scared somebody's gonna call you contacting you challenge you and once they come home you're not gonna be challenging me you gonna be challenging where the Prophet said it or not and if I read what he said what am I worried about don't bother me at all Church following me and what I'm saying the dead had been raised the sick had been healed Martha and then Mary later into a - was saying the same thing north across the Son of God they had a great confidence built into this man that they called Jesus but he was trying to get him to see who he was that he was Almighty God not a son of God not a second person other he was trying to get him to see that then they looked at this man one day and they saw him beat to smithereens to look like a Bible you and declare it how they've beaten so much it looked like a piece of hamburger meat bread around describes it just cut to pieces you realize Martha and Mary and M was sitting there saying we've seen him do this we've seen him do that we've seen this editor Lee says why can't he walk away why is all this happening to him why couldn't he just get up and walk out said we've seen him do that the Bible tells it one time they were taking him out to stone him he just turns around walks out they wouldn't have the skirt on he just did some way he disappeared you know to their understanding they just walked out are you following what I'm trying to get you to see even after he had told them what would happen described in almost minut detail of relating them back to scriptures even with with you know telling them to go back and this does not this speak of that does not this speak of that and knowing that he had to die and not a one of them understood it right not a one of them coming okay Lord we know you got to die so we'll go with you no they didn't even want to go with him they didn't want to be around him they run I have to see it all of these things do you think they believed he'd raised oh it was a rumor and quote to come on right it was so much on the first day when him disappear till it was called a rumor a rumor went around that he had raised well what happened to the great understanding of Martha and Mary to be we know you can do this we know God is with you what didn't they remember what he was just saying he said destroy this body and I'll raise it up I am the resurrection didn't somebody come up with that idea no they were all running backwards before trying to find somebody with some kind of an answer then he walks among them don't tell me when Jesus walked among them that they all jumped up now glory hallelujah he's right he's here now now they're scared to death cause they didn't know what is going on they were in Orkut early and shocked to see him standing there oh we make light of Thomas right we make light oh yeah they did that Thomas was the one that didn't believe where as in the rest of them that believed it Thomas believed it more than they did I've always defended him because you know what all it took just put his hand as quick as he put his hand he was the first one to declare who was standing there right yeah we sold that he didn't believe Peter then was shaken to death as scared to death it's all secured when he walked among them he said peace be still after a little while it took a settling down part you know what I'm talking about it took him a little while and all at once they begin to settle in and they begin to realize who he was but they still couldn't figure it out because you find him in acts one when the Lord Jesus was fixed into a sin that he'd been with him for thirty forty days or something so many days that he'd been with him after his resurrection and he who begins to descend during the book of Acts one I think he did and they said will you restore the kingdom to Israel at this time but Iran said they were still thinking about Jesus having some kind of a natural Kingdom now if you followed me through the thought could we have this great understanding of believing the Bible believing the message believing the things and it not produced the god of the word are we afraid here in the last days that things are falling apart what about it see then he proved when he raised he proved who he was when he raised he proved that he was the IM of the Old Testament Ezekiel or extra disk Guzman 3 he proved a tax seven and 3738 that he was at the burning bush he proved when he said I am that Bread of Life he said before Abraham was I am now listen is it true that the Bible said that he opened their understanding of the scriptures well see these are the things that begin to be opening true he proved that he was the I am of the Old Testament and that the I am of the Old Testament was the Lord Jesus Christ our Jehovah than you his resurrection proved it a lot of things could be based upon wondering and all and that's what I'm trying to tell you they already had had the dead raised to sit healed in the time before the resurrection of the Lord Jesus but that resurrection proved proved who he was it proved then when he got to the place that he raised that his positive statement was true he said I am the resurrection that was proved to be true when he raised his own bodies proved there was something alive instead of a dead words or letters on the page I believe this or I believe that the Bible says that the Prophet said it all that's well and good but what about your revelation what about it what about your profit making this statement to us message called faith 1961 your resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit okay immediately now that here we go boy we're revelaed heed hope brother Dale he said darts in our spirit it's in our spirit and the resurrection of that experience it ain't nice in his flesh it ain't in them five senses called our spirit but the Prophet said it was he said that spirit that he's talking about was the Spirit of God our five senses spirit is not the spirit of God that's why it's got to be redeemed just what I'm saying see we're not Martha and Mary name we've quickly jumped to a conclusion or a thought instead of taking what the Prophet is saying to us and listening to what he's saying we're taking it as to whether or not it's the spirit or the soul or whether it's this or whether it's that well he said it was the spirit so I can see that brother now I can see that I can see that within my memories I can't that's what a brother done here one time in the ministers meeting was a heaven I won't call his name but somebody made a statement he got it he said I can see that I've got up I said I saw it ain't cold it's wrong of course I wouldn't like but if it was wrong when I say it was wrong we see to him I can see that I said I can't ain't caught it's wrong it's time for us to settle down on the basis of what do we believe all right yeah and like I said while ago instead of finding some key will not read what he says okay go ahead let's read it give me just a minute go ahead brothers pull up number five and let's read it okay this is the message called faith paragraph one when you got to use faith in God to make it work these so you've got your own resurrection inside of you now listen your resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit whatever to you it's in the spirit why cut it off that's what you do you won't read the rest of the message you won't listen to him explain what he's talking about it's just in my spirit if I get my spirit straightened out we'd be all right I agree we if we could get our spirit straightened out but ain't no boat one way to get that spirit straight now let's kill it annihilate that spirit control of us and let this simple word be the answer those look the resurrected lays inside of you in your spirit now you know when Jesus died on the cross his soul descended into hell and preached to the souls that were in prison well no no no no spirit lamp because the Bible says his spirit when the Bible says that the Bible says it was his spirit did when the Prophet said it was a soul at one when Jesus died on the cross his soul descended into hell and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in the long suffering the days of Noah his body went into the grave but before he died he committed his spirit into the hands of God into the hands into thy hands commit come in my spirit so you see his spirit went to God his soul went to hell and his body went to the grave now that spirit that was in him not mine and yours that spirit that was in him was the Spirit of God our spirit is not the spirit of God it's the spirit of our reason and memory conscience affections etc come on and that spirit and Sundra times and divers manners anointed the prophets to bring the message to the people and the last days through Christ now in these days here through the gospel people reading on down onto those things he says you have the power in you now to create a world is it laying in your spirit no can't be in your spirit because that's memory reason conscious that's contrary I listen why are you looking for a resurrection when you already have the resurrection in you so you're gonna be tied up and that's what I'm true with that I still forget it I ain't reading the rest of it because you see that's where the argument among the ministers of this message spirit sölden go back and reading the 61 I've taught it to you up until not about 1964 63 brother branham basically taught body soul spirit after the opening of the seals and thing he taught body spirit soul well which one's right he was right in both places because in the early ministry he was describing the five senses of the second realm of mankind whether he called his spirit or soul that doesn't make no difference to me he was right the opening of the word brought the truth into being to him so then here's my point I thought we said we believed the scripture I thought we believe that we were resurrected is this Bible now or now resurrect hidden doing what sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus I thought that's what the Bible explains the new birth is being but the new birth is the Spirit of Christ coming in us to give a birth to you and me to give us eternal life and to put an inside teacher into us that would not be an outside person so your resurrection lays inside of you well if I could just just see the Reverend your resurrection lays inside of you in that new birth that you have are we listening are we still like Martha and Mary are we still trying to figure out some key to connect it to are we simply going to believe what the Prophet says just leave the word believe the Bible the resurrect is sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus amend them you want your resurrection see then is inside of you it's in your being it's what you are when you're born again that puts Christ in you the hope of glory well I don't understand it cuz it's it's fear now I got to say I don't care what you I've got spirit okay go right ahead I ain't arguing with nobody I've taught this for an almost 50 years saying argue will you not know that I'm gonna tell you how stupid we all are I said about the best basis of it instead of just believing what God said through a prophet we try to figure out what the Prophet saying it's not that the same thing we've done with the Bible that we tried to figure out what it was saying instead of reading what it would say it where is there anything more plainer than what did it John 3:16 for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son well I wasn't God we got over here in the Sun over here that's what I'm talking to you about see that was Mary and Martha's problem they were trying to talk to this man that they thought had a connection to God instead of seeing that man was God now that's the best way I can describe it is that what we're trying to do they just simply believe when Jesus said unless you believe that I am here you'll die in your sins does that need interpreting does it need interpreting that your resurrection lays inside of you does it need to be interpreted that we are the children of God we are his offspring does it need to be interpreted you must be born again what are you talking about brother than what are you trying to get Jesus had a positive attitude when he said I am the resurrection he was saying Martha don't you realize you heard the story about the burning bush you heard that I am that I am he said I am that resurrection but you know not another thing was said of Martha and Mary about that read your Bible jesus said just show me where you put him right they didn't say come on now then come on now we believe who you are go raise him didn't do it he said just show me were you lady I like the statement that was made by someone one time about it when he come to Lazarus he said Lazarus come for sit what if he said all of them come for what if he'd call for ever born again I mean every person that would ever to be a Christian I mean for what if he's got ever come forward he specified who he's won't leaves won't Lazarus because he wanted them to see that he could do it not brag about it and show how good he was but to show them who he was they had their confidence in a great thing it was wonderful of their confidence that they had in him if you just have been here he's been alright anyway even now even now whatever you ask God whatever you asked is not a person they never said whatever you say will be it right if you just say it that'll take care of it no come on musician Easter message what is your Easter message you hear the great stories are going through and that's wonderful I love them too of all the things in the different things telling you know when there's that in the other but there stood a man that declared himself to be Almighty God as the Easter opened that understanding to you as your new birth has your understanding as you're studying this message has it brought Jesus Christ to you as a person not as a thought or a concept or an idea not in a memory reason conscience water but in your very being of who you are can you say inside of me lives I'm not looking for a resurrection I've been looking at the resurrection over fifty years when I saw it I'm not looking for a rapture you're not know cuz resurrection comes for rapture simple but that you simply believe in the Word of God I just simply believe the Word of God the Bible said the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain meet you a brother years ago gave me a great big book wanted me to write down these thoughts and concepts on and the point was this now he wanted to know should we have communion and then foot washing or should we have foot washing first and then have communion why does it make any difference is there some great revelation involved here I said now according to what we understand we can read the Bible of the foot washing you know in the thing and the breaking of the bread and the way it sounds the way we've always taught it is that you had to communion the bread first and then you had the foot worship I said what is a great thing well I read this brother sword so I read this this this book about this man and he said we had it backwards said we spoke to how the foot washing first and then out of the communion I said well where's that going changes you know in other words what's that gonna make any difference let's see to him I was degrading his spiritual understanding till he wouldn't speak to me for about five years I ain't joking the next time I contacted I'm called him and his wife was on the phone and I said I'd like to speak to brother so-and-so and she turns around and says it loud enough that I could hear everything she said and hear everything he said and she said brother so and brother dad's wanting you bro he said brother who when he come to the phone I said yeah brother Dale about five years ago was the last contact we had but I haven't changed my name the heel he was so upset at me because I didn't agree with a foot washing of the community I hope you listen to the message today or in your thoughts Martha and Mary had these things all figured out Jesus didn't fuss with him and argue with him he just let him go through all of their whole line and he didn't raise Lazarus on the knee of what they said he just turned back around and he said listen I'm the god of the word in four days ago he showed me the resurrection of Lazarus said now show me where he's at simple is this message becomes simple to you or a great theological point I know I know how you think my brother Dale waged on the seals we don't need to understand these sealed we need to understand these simple thing simple time your prophet told him that ought to be simple enough he thought it ought to be simple enough what about at church Jesus had a positive statement about it when he said I am the resurrection can you make a positive statement and say by the new birth now listen I have the resurrection inside of me then you state that this stated by the new birth I have the resurrection inside of me I sniffle enough Mustang oh we got really how is empty about having a your stone is rolled away Pastis type which is concur in me there's a lot [Music] think about him [Music] no problem your healing side and if you resurrections inside of here your healing is out of you let's go fake it [Music] quit trying to read something to figure it out reading what it said and money ups it have a name Christ [Music] I doubt the promise was to bring a pride of people to a place that they could speak the word if that's not what you studied the message and found I would ask you to study it some more to try to get us to the basis of believing who we are what we're here for and to speak let him make it manifest let's go say it see when you're hurt and say bye stripes I'm healed you ever been hurting so bad do you just didn't even feel like you could say that but what does that got to do with it just coming to a realization to realize that you and I are the bride of Jesus Christ and he's waiting on us to speak the word and I see them now I have to we stand in a church one dominus young convert person minister got up boy he was in ninth and making light of him telling you what happened he said I take every spirit in this building under my control I said God don't turn them devils loose because he ain't got nothing under his control he said we'll give you the right say that because you have problems you know nothing under control it was out of control the your you're looking at a man is very funny as a brother used to come to church here and I'd ask God not to do nothing while he was here you're stupid I'll agree with you but I knew one thing for certain he'd take away and he'd go and he'd run it it would be going wrong I said Lord just don't do nothing while he's here you know what one day I told it I said brother have you ever noticed when you come to Loula God don't do nothing that's because I've asked him because you ain't ride more he didn't like that that was true so I want God to do it I'm not trying to build you up to get you to pump up to speak something call for something I'm trying to get you to just simply believe the word and let that just drop down in your heart and then you just speak back from your heart say thank you there's the resurrection the resurrection is to see a person not a doctrine or an idea it's the person of Jesus Christ living in me and you Lord Jesus as we go into natural media we ask you to just help us help us to see Lord that you truly have made and we didn't get to the thought you have made all things new a new creation a new people that could believe your word and we thank you got us in Jesus now you dismiss remember the services afternoon pray one for another [Music] listen closely [Music] your name you can't touch him you [Music] ah [Applause] [Music] Hey Oh [Music] it's me listen closely go your name you can't touch him [Music]
