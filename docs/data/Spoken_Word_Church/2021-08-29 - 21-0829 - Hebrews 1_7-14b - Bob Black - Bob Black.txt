========================================

god bless you saints you can turn in your bible over to hebrews again it's good to be back in the house of the lord and and it is good to have terence back um let's uh hit the brothers could pull up the powerpoint slide and uh we'll just we'll just go through a little review of hebrews 1 and and and just kind of talk about where we left off god who has sundry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets so paul again he was explaining that that that god um in the old testament spake in time passed in a lot of different ways a lot of different times he was the one doing the speaking through the prophets and then in this last days he spake unto us by his son the one that was doing the speaking was made manifest and now everything that we hear and everything that we believe everything that we teach stem from the things that he spoke for those three and a half years that he was on the earth who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person he was actually that the uh if you want to know who the father is you look at look at the the one that declared his majesty and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high and we'll we'll look at that a little bit in more detail a little bit later set down what that means to sit down on the right hand and brother brown said that means that that's a position to sit down in the right hand a position of power and authority on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they because he's the act he's he he was god manifesting flesh the one that was doing the speaking through the old testament for under which the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him and then we'll go over to hebrews 1 7 on the next slide you know you kind of think about paul paul was you follow these patterns through their scripture and paul really was after the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost um they they they were beginning to tie they began they came out and began to preach about what this is that that the prophet joel talked to talked about and began to lay in in this in the scripture identify what had happened with the scripture but really until paul began to lay things out and begin to teach and lay things out they they really didn't maybe not know fully what they had and he paul began to lay out in the book of hebrews begin to talk about how that um now now we've entered into that rest that was prophesied in the old testament that was kind of spoken of in type and now he identified that holy ghost they had with the melchizedek that that talked to abraham the one that came to him now was actually dwelling within them so paul was laying out for them a foundation that now they can really begin to understand the things the thing that they have and now now carry that on into this day that brother branham after the after the holy ghost fell on azusa street now brother branham now he's also laying out things laying out exactly what they've got that we we have something more than just gifts and signs and wonders we've actually got again like like paul laid out we've got that melchizedek that came and spoke to abraham that's the one that's actually living on the inside of us and actually living out his life in us so we've tapped into that we've tapped into that supernatural power now so so and in hebrew just to kind of set the maybe set in your mind the context of what we're talking about and and in hebrews 1 7 we talked about in the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire and we kind of begin to to examine that a little bit more and to know that that the angels so many times you read scriptures and at first you when you're reading it you have a perception of what it's really trying to say and the more that you read it it begins to open up and begin begins to unfold and you begin to realize maybe you weren't looking at it in the right way initially as god begins to speak to you and this might be one of those things where initially we're looking at it as from the perspective of well there's supernatural angels and but then as the more you read and meditate on the things that brother random said about this he's bringing it down to an an earthly an actual where you sit in church and you can listen to a man speak to you and help help you and can benefit by going to church now if we go we'll kind of go through some of these slides a little bit quickly and brother brown said the greatest battle ever fought he said that god sends forth angels what are they ministering spirits ministering spirits sent from the presence of god what to do minister his word they're not to minister some theology of some denominational group but to minister his words and now let's go to the next slide real quickly and he said in hebrews chapter 2 he said what do we find the angels to be prophets the angels are prophets the angels that that now again that paul is talking about in hebrews he said god spoken sundry time now you have to make not our own idea but the bible and and he said now he goes over here and say again for the words spoken by angels we're steadfast and what does an angel mean messenger if god anointed messenger and then if we be anointed we are god's messenger if we be anointed by that spirit and then you've got the true meaning of what a ministering spirit is it's actually the spirit of god speaking through an earthly vessel to minister to give somebody to equip the the chosen ones with something that they can can overcome with and if you'll go to the next slide just kind of a summary of some of the scriptures that we talked about last week and in hebrews chapter one he talks about it starts off with who make us his angel spirits and his ministers a flame of fire and then at the very end of the chapter he says are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation and then really the clincher that brother brother ram talked about in hebrews chapter 2 he said for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection this is actually quoting david from the old testament he said but one in a certain place testified and he quotes what david said showing there that this angel that he's quoting was an an actual earthly angel an earthly messenger a man david that had a message to deliver to the people and then the next slide he said now how do we know they are these angels minister his word through his spirits spirit minister the word through the holy spirit and the spirit and the word came to the prophet the prophets and the prophets had the word of god that's the reason they could do the miracles that they did it wasn't the man it was the spirit of god in the man the spirit of christ and the man for the word of god and let's go to the next the next slide see he said in discernment of spirit he said now a new testament prophet is a preacher we all know that just any minister that's a preacher is a prophet a new testament prophet if he's prophesying preaching not to try to edify himself to make a big name or to edify his organization and then the next paragraph he said now if we will notice the motives and objectives of the old testament prophets them men had one objective and that was jesus christ they had one thing that their whole theme of the old testament was built around the coming messiah now the old testament if their motive those those angels in the old testament their motive was entirely fixated on declaring the coming messiah now what should our motive be in this day not to build up some our own following or to promote our own ideas but it should all be centered around one objective and that is jesus christ and then the next slide we already looked at that so that's a duplicate so we'll skip over that now brother brahman said and we would see jesus he said just a couple of quotes to kind of clinch this a little bit further he said the clergyman the ministers of the gospel sitting here on the platform angels ordained to preach life angels that the ministers of the gospel sitting up there in a platform with him would be actually angels ordained to preach life and then in the way back he said he was talking about stephen when he uh preached his his little sermon there in in the seventh chapter of acts he said his face shine like an angel his face might not have shined like an angel up there but an angel knows what he's doing an angel is a messenger that's commissioned from god now so we've got a little background a little bit we kind of talked about that last last sunday that the angels that paul's talking about are ministers to bring you the word now let's go over to first corinthians real quick on the next slide and talk about this maybe often misunderstood scripture that says for this cause off the woman now in first corinthians chapter 11 if you if you're not familiar with that paul actually lays down how how why we we believe that we we wear long hair why do we wear long hair now this is here's the reason he said for this cause off the woman to have power the sisters i'm talking about the sisters where long hair ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels now hebrews chapter one we just went through what was it what are the angels what does that mean though what see a lot of times you can be getting the perception in your mind you begin to think that you're wearing long hair because you're scared of some kind of supernatural entity that you can't see or something that the angels might be present walking around in the building and so you're wearing long hair because of a supernatural angel that could be sitting in the chair that's not the meaning of it that's not the meaning that he's trying to convey and if you go down to in verse 15 it says but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is giving her for a covering so there's the proof now that that and in first corinthians chapter 11 he talks about you you got to have a woman's got to have her hair covered her head covered but her hair is actually given to her for recovery that's the covering that god gave you is your long hair why do you wear long hair now now way down at the bottom i apologize you can't read that maybe that's just a note for myself but power if you go back to what look at what the greek says power the definition of that word power in this case is it's a sign of the husband's authority over his wife in other words the veil with which propriety required a woman to cover herself so she's got power on her head which shows that she's in subjection to her husband now that's boy that's a touchy subject because you know one of the one of the most difficult one of the most difficult things that god has been trying to do is to bring his bride into total subjection to him one of really one of the most difficult things if you can get if you can get a man and a woman and are in perfect harmony and the woman is in subjection to the man in the right way not not all of this tommy rotten pollution that's out there but if you can hit a real man running his home the way she should and a woman in subjection to that man then my you've got a real you you've got a masterpiece so the reason let's look let's examine that now the reason that a woman is supposed to wear long hair because of the angels she's showing that she is living her life under the authority of the message that the angels the ministers have brought to her so she's showing that she's under headship to the word and that's why she has a long hair now that's why paul again if you go back and read in first corinthians chapter 11 he says if you're going to cut off a little bit of your hair you might as well cut it it's it's as though you were just go ahead and cut it all off because if you're going to say well i'm not going to believe all any other word then you're not really believing you're not believing the word you you wear your long hair is a a symbol that you believe the word that you have heard now let's go to the next slide and see what brother brahm said about it he said in the meanest man in santa maria don't you love brother around his sermon titles he said that's the way the women is supposed to wear long hair because of her head which is her husband because of her of her head which is her husband you wear long hair because it shows you're under headship to your husband he's to have short hair because of christ the woman wears long hair because of the angels what is the angels the messenger a true messenger to the church that's right he will always call it down and say it's wrong see and so forth and the church to be so yielded to jesus that it don't claim its own head its own headship christ is the headship of the church veiled we're not our own but where he is yielded to him and him alone how beautiful now you see how scripture just ties together so perfectly that now we can read hebrews 1 and 2 and then go over to hebrew in first corinthians 11 and now we have an understanding of what this scripture means that you wear long hair because you're under you're not your own anymore you've been bought with a price and and you're yielded to your husband and it shows that you're he is now and so you wear long hair to show that you know that's one of those things that you know really you can argue all day long about many of these things but i when when the holy ghost really gets a hold of you and opens it up to you then it removes the argument and you actually begin to live out what paul was talking about here let's go to the next slide he says now now this is just kind of a summary of of of what we've been talking about the angels are an angel is a new testament prophet filled with the holy spirit anointed to bring the word a new testament the difference between an old testament prophet and a new testament prophet is the new testament prophet has got the baptism in the holy ghost in their soul and that that's that's a that's a pretty big difference the ability for god to actually tabernacle himself inside of someone now in the new testament and speak out to minister his word he said they're not to minister some theology of some denominational group but to minister his word reflecting the light of jesus christ the apostles pastors teachers evangelist prophets under their messenger and that's that's a big key what we'll look at in a second now let's go to the next slide he said then the prophet or the preacher which is a new testament prophet a preacher when he comes forth begins to move through himself and he that's a quote where he's just trying to place the gifts in the church that when you a gift of prophecy is when a gift god can speak through use someone in that moment to speak through and prophesy but a a prophet or the preacher which is a new testament prophet when he comes forth and begins to deliver his message god's actually using him to deliver something to the church let's go to the next slide he said a prophet is a seer who sees now see here's the difference between a new testament prophet slash preacher and a prophet who's a seer a prophet is a seer who sees the people's heart and foretells the things that's coming to pass but a prophet p-r-o-p-h-e-t is born to prophet always from but was ordained before the world ever begin see now you take jesus christ the king of prophets he was from the garden of eden the seed of the woman and prophet and moses was born a proper child the prophet john the baptist why isaiah saw him 712 years before he was born and said he's the voice of one crying in the wilderness 712 12 years before he was born god said before he was even formed in his mother's womb that he knew him and sanctified him and ordained him a prophet to the nations now let's examine this a little bit more on the next slide now so a new testament prophet is somebody that's preaching the word in the new testament i think we've proven that out now that's that's god god they've got the baptism of the holy ghost and they're meant they're ministering spirit but now within that within that you've got like highlighted in green and this this chart maybe uh has a few issues and i'll explain that in a second so but but in the in the first church days paul was a prophet a seer that he said i went to the third heaven and all those kind of things and underneath him underneath him he had there's apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors and within that five full ministry there's an office called a prophet and that is a seer and there are prophets still in the day i i was sharing earlier in one of the earlier sunday school lessons that there there are prophets in africa and south america and throughout the world and i was listening to a testimony of one and i can out we can talk about that later if you're interested to know but um he was sharing how that he he has a gift where he can see visions and knows people he said i was listening to his testimony and he said i know who's trying to take over the church and he said i don't i don't share those things openly because you know i i did it at first initially in my in my life and that you begin to tear people places apart he said i don't want people to do things because they're afraid of me you're afraid of the gift i want i i don't want them to live a life because they're afraid of me i want them to live a life of worthy of the gospel because that the god has actually got a hold of them and changed them and they fall in love with christ but there are prophets and so don't get in your mind that we don't have prophets anymore there certainly are prophets but prophets in this case like paul a seer or or prophets in the final ministry a seer that's able to see a vision and and and and look into your life and those kind of things so there's when when brother branham would say in his message the word prophet sometimes it means a little bit different things it could mean a new testament prophet a preacher it could mean someone like paul or it could mean somebody somebody uh you know somebody within the five full ministry that has that gift of sight a gift a gift of prophecy to look into your life now now all down through the seven church ages you've got these ministers that are over they they bring a message for that age like paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley and and brother branham begins we're talking about ministering spirits now ministering spirits and each of those they're bringing a message for their age and under their message people get a hold of that men get a hold of that and they begin to declare that message so at the beginning isn't it interesting the very first church agent started out with a prophet at the very last church age it ended with a prophet and under those prophets under those men you've got the five-fold ministry one of which is a prophet a seer but all of them are speaking anointed by the holy ghost to deliver a message um i hope i hope that's clear if anybody has any questions feel free to i i love feedback i've gotten a lot of feedback so far about people can't see the slides and that the font needs to be bigger or anything and that don't bother me at all i want to i want to improve so if you if anything's not clear or anything feel free to to let me know or brother way or whatever now let's read this quote brother brown said in the dark ages the word was entirely lost to the people almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends toward dogma and creeds and not simple words they can no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation so in other words we're talking about these spirits that ministered in each age and under each age you've got these people that find full ministry that pick that message up and they also are ministering spirits to the people when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone on for the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age under their messenger so we uh we've got to say that exactly the same thing that he said let's go let's go to the next slide and look at this so we're again we're talking about the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire and that same thought can be carried on over into revelation ministering spirits the spirit of god actually ministering in in men where in revelation chapter one verse four it says john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and it talks about from the seven spirits which are before his throne and in revelation chapter three it says these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and in revelation chapter six says to the lambs that had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth now we're just following this thread from hebrews down first corinthians down into revelation following this this line of thought through the bible these are the same things ministering spirits that god is actually ministering through men now let's go to the next slide it says the sardisian church age the spirits was the angels that went to the stars which were messengers that's kind of a media little statement right there seven spirits seven different times the holy spirit would anoint a messenger which was a star in his day seven times the holy spirit would anoint a messenger so it's the holy spirit speaking through these seven men a spirit is eternal and the star that was made for a purpose to reflect light in the dark of these church ages where cane candles and stars are representing the angel the spirit was the one that went to the star and reflected the light of the holy spirit through this star to that church age it's the seven messengers of the seven church ages see now in each time that the star came in on the scene the holy spirit came down and anointed that star and kept it just exactly like the first one was now let's go to the next slide he said what is those seven spirits seven messengers there's saint columba and irenaeus and john wesley and martin luther and so forth the seven spirits which are seven men seven angels which are seven messengers now we're just following that following that three and now and we'll we'll end on this and of the angel let's just skip the next slide and go to the one right after that now the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and the musicians should go ahead and start coming forward who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire because when you got when you met the pillar of fire yourself when you've got an experience with god yourself it causes you you've got a message that you want to deliver so paul's saying again of the angels who saith he maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire the ministers get carrying forth a message for the people anointed by the spirit of god and god bless you and god bless the remaining servants
