[7:18] so that we can get something fellows if
[7:25] Bella messes me back there and she's
[7:28] like remembers telling this hmm I
[7:30] thought maybe I'd forgotten I had the
[7:32] note here amen
[7:39] just before I continue let's just
[7:43] remember sister Monica wanted to mention
[7:45] that at 12:35 her class will be
[7:48] practicing or to at least be here in the
[7:51] sanctuary by that time and Zach black
[7:55] needs to be here as well wherever he's
[7:57] at so make sure you do that praise the
[8:02] Lord because we have youth service this
[8:04] this afternoon Youth youth Sunday amen
[8:08] you love the Lord praise the Lord Jesus
[8:10] amen let's just go to the to the
[8:14] scriptures this this morning and just
[8:20] continue to remember brother Wade and
[8:21] brother Dale is there continue to travel
[8:24] thing brother did Wade he's speaking
[8:26] this morning in Kentucky I believe so I
[8:31] believe it's in Kentucky and also as it
[8:36] was mentioned this morning remember
[8:37] brother Claude and since he's in the
[8:41] hospital also brother Joe solace he
[8:43] messaged me last night and he asked that
[8:46] you remember his family in prayer his
[8:48] sister Gwen's family and prayer that I
[8:50] think hid his uh her aunt which would be
[8:53] his mom's her mom's sister passed away
[8:56] so they're there with the family I think
[8:59] in Tennessee if I'm not if I'm not
[9:01] mistaken so remember them in prayer as
[9:02] well praise the Lord Jesus let's uh
[9:05] let's go to the 1st Corinthians chapter
[9:07] 9 first Corinthians chapter 9 amen
[9:12] st. you know I I believe we come to the
[9:15] house of God amen - you know it's almost
[9:18] like it's almost like you know when you
[9:20] go to a football game if you've ever
[9:21] been to a football game and you see the
[9:24] people you know they're there the
[9:26] players are there and they're not there
[9:28] in a huddle you know but you don't go to
[9:32] the football game to see the football
[9:33] players just to be in a huddle for 30 40
[9:36] minutes right or for two hours you know
[9:39] you pay you pay a lot of money for a
[9:43] ticket that you that you that you
[9:45] purchase to go see a football game to
[9:47] see your team win right - see not not
[9:50] for them to - to be in a huddle amen and
[9:54] because what what the people want is the
[9:57] results that come out of the huddle you
[9:59] see and so I believe that's what we're
[10:01] here this morning Saints we're here as a
[10:04] team amen we're here in a huddle amen to
[10:07] hear from our coach a man who is the
[10:09] Holy Spirit in this hour amen and and
[10:12] and what the world wants a man wants to
[10:13] see is is that people that have huddled
[10:16] what they planned a man they want to see
[10:20] the results of that amen because Saints
[10:22] let me tell you what the world wants to
[10:24] see a true living Christ living in this
[10:27] hour amen
[10:28] they're tired of the of hypocrisy
[10:30] they're tired of somebody saying
[10:31] something and not living something they
[10:33] meant we want to live the the Word of
[10:36] God sure we make mistakes we fall in and
[10:38] we fall flat on our face but Saints the
[10:41] world wants to see a to live in Christ
[10:42] in this hour the world wants to see
[10:43] somebody really win and you and I are
[10:47] the winners in this hour it's declared
[10:49] in the Word of God amen
[10:52] so let's not just concentrate on just on
[10:55] the huddle everywhere Sunday and every
[10:57] Wednesday we come here and huddle we
[11:00] hear from our coach but then we don't go
[11:02] and do what what we hear you're in our
[11:05] huddle amen praise God if I could just
[11:08] kind of type it that way amen so let's
[11:10] go to first Corinthians chapter 9 I
[11:12] don't know if they have it up and they
[11:14] bring it up first Corinthians chapter 9
[11:16] verse 24 starting at verse 24 a man if I
[11:23] want to title this message tonight out
[11:24] oh this morning
[11:25] I just want to title it what are you
[11:27] aiming for in life something something a
[11:31] bit more practical but but maybe maybe
[11:35] maybe it can help you in this hour and I
[11:38] want to I want to aim I want to speak to
[11:41] our younger brothers and sisters and
[11:43] kids and we got graduating seniors
[11:48] coming in and and and and now and some
[11:51] and and so we are all in different
[11:53] stages even if you're an adult that you
[11:56] gotta you need to ask that question what
[11:58] are you aiming for in life what are you
[12:01] aiming at what is your goal in life or
[12:04] are you just driftwood just floating
[12:06] just going with the flow I will you know
[12:11] we don't want to be that way
[12:12] amen so let's let's just let's just read
[12:14] this says I know you not that they which
[12:19] run in a race run all but one receiveth
[12:22] the price so run that you may obtain and
[12:25] every man that striveth for the mastery
[12:28] is temperate in all things now they do
[12:32] it to obtain a corruptible crown but we
[12:35] an incorruptible I therefore so run not
[12:39] as uncertainly so fight I not as one
[12:42] that beateth the air but I keep under my
[12:46] body and bring it into subjection lest
[12:48] that by any means when i have preached
[12:51] to others i myself should be cast away
[12:54] praise the lord you may be seated
[12:55] this this morning actually let's have a
[12:58] word of Prayer sorry about that let's
[13:00] just pray our Heavenly Father we thank
[13:03] you once again Lord for your love mercy
[13:05] and grace and father God as we just open
[13:08] back the pages of your word we ask that
[13:10] you'd bless it to our hearts and Lord
[13:12] help us father God to just get aside so
[13:14] that you may say father God what we need
[13:16] to hear what will help us Lord God to be
[13:18] more like you lord lord bless the
[13:21] brother Dale brother Wade as they're out
[13:23] bring them back home safely Lord this
[13:25] this this coming week and Lord we just
[13:28] commit our service the service into your
[13:30] hands and commit myself into you Lord
[13:32] I'm nothing without you father God but
[13:35] I'm all father God with you in Jesus
[13:37] Christ's name we ask
[13:39] amen praise the Lord you may be seated I
[13:41] also wanted to read the scripture here
[13:43] in Joshua chapter 1 verse 8 Joshua 1
[13:46] verse 8 says this book of the law shall
[13:49] not depart out of thy mouth but thou
[13:53] shalt meditate therein every now and
[13:58] then it doesn't say that right
[14:03] the scripture doesn't say that every now
[14:06] and then but it says there in day and
[14:08] night that thou listen listen what the
[14:12] good the goal here is that thou mayst
[14:15] observe to do according to all that is
[14:21] written therein now listen to this for
[14:27] then thou shalt make thy way prosperous
[14:30] and then thou shalt have not just
[14:37] success but good success amen
[14:42] because there could be bad success as
[14:44] well you could be successful in life
[14:47] rich wealthy there's a lot of rich
[14:49] wealthy people in this life but they
[14:53] have no clue about God that's one type
[14:56] of success but it's an earthly success
[14:59] but the scripture tells us here about
[15:01] good thou shall have good success only
[15:04] if this book of the law or this word
[15:08] does not depart from your mouth and that
[15:11] you meditate on it day and night it's
[15:13] very important Saints amen
[15:15] so so I want to title this message
[15:19] tonight water or this way this this
[15:20] morning I'm still used to just preaching
[15:22] at night I say tonight I'm not used to
[15:25] preaching in Sunday morning so you just
[15:27] bear with me and pray for us amen so
[15:29] this morning I want to title this what
[15:31] are you aiming for in life amen and like
[15:34] I said is this for our younger or
[15:36] younger brothers and sisters and kids
[15:39] and uh but it's for all of us amen
[15:42] because Saints we all have to have a
[15:45] certain goal that we're aiming for in
[15:47] life
[15:48] amen we have to have something that we
[15:50] are we are
[15:53] looking forward to amen because you
[15:56] can't just be here because the Bible
[15:58] says it without without of it without a
[15:59] vision the people perish if you have no
[16:02] vision in life if you have if you don't
[16:05] know what you want to do spiritually and
[16:10] physically because they both tie in
[16:12] together then you don't know where
[16:14] you're going you're just like a piece of
[16:17] wood that's just floating down the river
[16:18] have you ever been to the river and you
[16:20] see a piece of wood just floating down
[16:22] or a piece of trash just kind of
[16:25] floating down not calling you trash but
[16:27] I'm just saying a piece of something
[16:29] just floating down it has it doesn't
[16:32] know where it's going and it kind of
[16:34] hits the banks kind of ricochets back up
[16:36] and then and and and it's just kind of
[16:39] floating back and forth and doesn't it
[16:41] doesn't have a goal they meant I'm
[16:42] afraid a lot of people are living their
[16:44] lives that way even people who say they
[16:46] believe the Word of God they have no no
[16:50] no no end goal no no no no where they
[16:53] want to be in in a year or in two years
[16:57] or in five years or in ten years
[16:59] oh well life is the way it is and things
[17:03] are the way they are so I'm just gonna
[17:05] just just go with the flow and put this
[17:09] thing on cruise control and remember
[17:14] I've always said when you put it on
[17:15] cruise control you're going to fall
[17:18] asleep right whenever you put the the
[17:22] car on cruise control you have a higher
[17:24] tendency of falling asleep because
[17:26] you're not there moving that pedal
[17:28] you're not there you know you're not
[17:30] there holding in the pedal Amen you're
[17:33] not there holding in the gas Amen you're
[17:35] not there doing something they meant to
[17:36] cause the gas to part to to move you
[17:39] forward Amen you're not doing what
[17:41] you're supposed to do a man to make the
[17:43] gas which is the Holy Spirit a man that
[17:45] fire a man to move you forward in this
[17:48] life amen
[17:48] you're just there going with the flow
[17:52] amen
[17:53] but I believe the Bride of Christ is
[17:54] moving in this hour and I believe the
[17:56] Bride of Christ has a goal in this hour
[17:58] amen she's not driftwood she's not she's
[18:01] not just anybody amen
[18:03] just goes with the flow and just goes
[18:06] with a mess she is the Bride of Christ a
[18:08] man who has the mind of Christ amen and
[18:11] who has a goal to be like Christ amen
[18:14] praise the Lord Jesus this is our goal
[18:16] amen that is our goal praise the Lord
[18:20] Jesus amen so here in verse 24 Paul here
[18:26] is talking about in first Corinthians
[18:27] about about a race he brings in he
[18:31] brings sports into into the the arena I
[18:35] guess you could say and he he takes he
[18:39] takes people running in a race and types
[18:42] it with with us as the Bride of Christ
[18:45] running in this race of life amen
[18:48] because there's a lot of people in this
[18:52] it there's over seven billion people in
[18:54] this world everybody is running for this
[18:58] for this this route in this race called
[19:00] life right but there's only going to be
[19:03] one victor in this hour it's not like in
[19:06] schools you know schools nowadays a I
[19:09] heard just I heard I heard somebody say
[19:11] say that they celebrate mediocrity in
[19:14] schools nowadays because the second the
[19:17] second if yours if you get second place
[19:19] and you get just as much metal as the
[19:22] first place does and if you get a third
[19:24] place or even if you come in laughs you
[19:26] still get a medal they didn't always
[19:30] used to be that way amen
[19:32] yeah in God's mind that's not how things
[19:35] are there's only one victor in this hour
[19:37] and that victor is the Bride of Christ
[19:39] amen in this hour praise God you know
[19:42] what since you are a victor in this hour
[19:43] because the scripture says that you are
[19:45] we know what the end of the book says we
[19:48] certainly know that it's not the devil
[19:50] we know that there was not the one that
[19:53] wins
[19:55] it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[19:58] amen
[19:58] it's Christ in you amen that's the
[20:01] winner and this hour
[20:02] amen so why are we so just stuck on our
[20:07] mindset that I'm just going to float
[20:09] through this life just kind of just kind
[20:12] of floating and let's see what happens
[20:14] amen you have
[20:17] do something in order amen to make that
[20:19] scripture to produce that scripture that
[20:21] you are a winner and at the at the end
[20:23] time amen there's a part that you have
[20:26] to do sure God did did his part amen
[20:30] he died for us he made a way for our
[20:33] salvation he sent a prophet in this hour
[20:36] amen
[20:37] right he did everything he could for us
[20:41] now there's a part that you and I must
[20:44] do and that part amen God's not going to
[20:48] force us to just just just do it no
[20:52] that's why I like about God that he's a
[20:55] gentleman he doesn't force himself on
[20:58] you they men he never has we he's given
[21:03] us free moral agency right from the
[21:05] beginning he gave Adam Freeman agency
[21:08] and that with that free more agency we
[21:12] know what happened he made the wrong
[21:14] decision amen
[21:16] and are we making the right decisions in
[21:19] this hour because remember the decisions
[21:21] that you make now will will affect you
[21:24] listen to me young people the decisions
[21:26] that you make now will affect you a year
[21:29] from now the decisions that you make now
[21:31] will affect you two years from now the
[21:34] decision that you make right now
[21:36] whatever you're thinking right now
[21:38] that's what you are and that's what
[21:40] you'll continue to be but that's what
[21:44] the Bible says as a man thinketh in his
[21:45] heart so is he
[21:48] whatever you think about right now
[21:50] whatever you're thinking of that's
[21:52] exactly what you are
[21:55] amen we'll get to that later
[21:57] amen so Paul says here Paul's here he's
[22:00] talking about here in an Olympic relay
[22:03] amen because we're all running this race
[22:06] of life praise God and nobody nobody
[22:09] here how many come here then they want
[22:11] to lose when you're when you're playing
[22:16] sports and when you're playing a game or
[22:18] when you play I want to play to lose I
[22:21] can't wait to play that game so that I
[22:24] can lose so that everybody could just
[22:26] point you know just say I'm a loser
[22:29] I can't wait nobody here comes here with
[22:35] that mentality
[22:36] nobody even from a young young a young
[22:39] boy young girl they come here with a
[22:42] mentality that they want to win they
[22:45] want to be a victor they want to that
[22:48] they want to outdo the other one right
[22:50] now that there's a good mentality and
[22:53] having that of being a one and two win
[22:55] there's also the mentality of being too
[22:57] competitive that you get jealous when
[22:59] somebody else wins and somebody else
[23:03] winning and saying you're not in the and
[23:05] you're not in the place that you think
[23:06] that you need to be at and you start
[23:09] getting jealous you start getting that
[23:11] attitude wait a second and start playing
[23:13] a victim becoming that's on you that's
[23:19] not the one who won they did their part
[23:21] you've got to do your part amen
[23:24] you see so nobody here in this world
[23:27] nobody here in this life wants to lose a
[23:29] man I remember I remember I was back
[23:31] partly around 2008 we visited brother
[23:34] Joe's house this is before way before we
[23:36] moved here to Georgia and we were at
[23:39] brother Joe's house and Josiah was very
[23:41] young I remember I remember how old he
[23:43] was but back in 2007-2008 cuz Bella was
[23:47] just born she was just a little baby and
[23:49] I sat down with him I was give this
[23:51] example I sat down with him to play
[23:53] tic-tac-toe I remember we were there in
[23:55] the kitchen floor or right there near
[23:57] the floor I was playing tic-tac-toe with
[23:59] Josiah and and I remember I remember
[24:03] that there was a moment that I said that
[24:06] I looked away I don't remember why I
[24:08] looked away and all of a sudden Josiah
[24:11] puts a little circle in one of the
[24:13] blocks now I knew that he did that and
[24:17] when I looked at LEM when I looked down
[24:19] and I looked at him and I said what's
[24:21] that and he's like now I say that not
[24:29] not to embarrass Josiah but just to say
[24:31] this that as little kids he was he was a
[24:34] small child at the time but he had that
[24:37] desire to win even him he came into this
[24:40] world with that desire to win and
[24:43] nobody here in this world comes in this
[24:45] life to what we want to win amen and
[24:47] this our Saints God has his winners in
[24:49] this our Amen God remember how God has a
[24:52] winner
[24:53] and we know who the winner is amen we
[24:57] know the winner is that's the Bride of
[24:58] Christ praise the Lord are you part of
[25:00] that bride amen are you walking in that
[25:03] word amen praise the Lord Jesus so here
[25:08] in verse 24 it says it says but one
[25:12] receiveth the price amen out of all
[25:16] those running only one is gonna receive
[25:19] the price not five not seven not eight
[25:23] hey man one's gonna receive the price
[25:27] praise the Lord Jesus amen so the
[25:31] scripture continues to say it says so
[25:33] run that ye may obtain amen that's the
[25:39] way we're supposed to run to obtain to
[25:41] win that's the way we're supposed to to
[25:44] live this life amen with a with a
[25:47] mentality that I want to win I want to
[25:51] run this race because I want to lose no
[25:53] I want to run this race because I want
[25:55] to win amen and he's already won for us
[25:58] amen
[25:59] he's already given us the victory he's
[26:01] already paid the price for us he's
[26:03] already amen he's already defeated the
[26:05] devil he already stripped the keys from
[26:06] his from his side and kicked them out
[26:09] like brother branham said kicked him out
[26:10] he's got he's the one who gave us power
[26:13] for over over hell death in the grave so
[26:17] why not take advantage of that why not
[26:19] use that as the as the throttle they
[26:22] managed against the gas to keep you
[26:24] moving amen but we forget about the
[26:28] forgive the things that God has done for
[26:30] us as we move in in this day and this
[26:33] life day by day we work we live we raise
[26:36] our children we come to church we leave
[26:39] church we do it and we forget the
[26:42] benefits that we have in this hour amen
[26:46] that we have the revealed word in this
[26:51] hour the revealed word amen good to see
[26:56] our sister
[26:57] amen praise the Lord the revealed word
[27:00] in this hour amen
[27:03] that's a privilege science yeah that's
[27:06] something that you need to be thankful
[27:07] for sometimes we don't take full
[27:10] advantage of that
[27:11] oh my maybe this is not what you come to
[27:17] hear but hopefully you come here and I
[27:21] leave here today and it quickly put it
[27:24] to practice Amen because that's why I
[27:26] want to say something that you can leave
[27:28] here today and put it to practice right
[27:30] away amen
[27:31] right away and especially for our young
[27:33] people they man I love our young people
[27:36] I have a I care for them and and and
[27:40] young people listen if we didn't care
[27:42] for you Amen we wouldn't first of all we
[27:44] wouldn't be praying for you second of
[27:47] all we wouldn't try to stimulate you and
[27:52] keep you around in atmospheres that will
[27:54] be beneficial to you amen God wants if
[27:59] we want the if we want the best for you
[28:01] how much more God amen
[28:05] how much more your parents oh oh they
[28:09] just my mom and dad they're always just
[28:13] down my throat constantly constantly
[28:15] just they don't leave me alone
[28:18] everything everything everything I do
[28:20] they always criticize you maybe just to
[28:30] think maybe that's God speaking through
[28:32] that and put and look to see if what
[28:38] you're doing goes along with his word
[28:40] because if it's not in the word then why
[28:43] not get spanked huh if it's not in the
[28:48] word than why not Amen get rebuked
[28:55] because God does the same thing to us if
[28:58] you're not in the word if you're not
[29:00] obeying his word if you're not if you're
[29:01] not following his word the way you need
[29:03] to be then you need to be rebuked that's
[29:06] the only way you're going to get life
[29:07] and they meant with
[29:08] little baby when he's born and he's not
[29:10] crying he's not he's not he's not moving
[29:12] he's not doing anything he needs to get
[29:14] that for the plasmic spank and then he
[29:21] starts crying he starts moving right but
[29:24] that was for his benefit I wasn't there
[29:25] hurt the little baby that was to make it
[29:28] live amen and that's what that's why God
[29:31] has placed the fivefold ministry in this
[29:34] hour amen
[29:35] - sometimes a man just do that to us
[29:38] smack us in the face do whatever he
[29:41] needs to be stumped on our toes amen but
[29:43] it'll cause us good to leave here with
[29:45] some life amen
[29:48] that's what we want his life saying us
[29:50] we don't want to be we're gonna be
[29:52] zombies amen
[29:57] so amen so in order to win this race of
[30:02] life amen
[30:03] you must run properly and with a
[30:06] spiritual aim and a goal and a purpose
[30:10] in life amen
[30:12] somebody said one time they men I like I
[30:15] like listening to a man named Earl
[30:17] Nightingale and he said he said one time
[30:19] he said people with goals succeed
[30:22] because they know where they're going
[30:26] just like a boat a ship a man who is
[30:29] docked at a at a at a dock if if the
[30:34] captain has studied where where they're
[30:37] gonna go how long they're gonna is gonna
[30:39] take to get there what what course they
[30:42] need to they need to go through to get
[30:44] there and that everything is aiming to
[30:47] get there everything they they plan
[30:49] everything out they're gonna get there
[30:51] don't you think so but if you don't plan
[30:55] it but let's say the ship just kind of
[30:57] just leaves the dock and just doesn't
[30:59] know where it's going just kind of it's
[31:01] gonna end up in a deserted island
[31:02] somewhere and it's gonna end up in a in
[31:05] the middle of a sinkhole somewhere a
[31:07] black hole somewhere why because it
[31:10] didn't it didn't it didn't have a goal
[31:12] they didn't have a target it didn't have
[31:16] didn't have a plan to to go where they
[31:20] do to be at
[31:21] place where they want to go and you have
[31:24] to have a plan in this our Saints amen
[31:28] you have to know where you're going
[31:30] young people you have to know what you
[31:33] want to do what is it that you wanted
[31:35] out of life first of all you have to
[31:38] have God if you Center everything around
[31:42] God first let me tell you everything
[31:45] else will come out right if you put God
[31:49] first in every single thing whether it's
[31:51] what college I'm going to whether is
[31:54] what what man or what woman I'm gonna
[31:56] marry it where where what I'm gonna even
[32:01] even what I'm gonna wear if you put God
[32:06] first you'll always come out right
[32:11] always if you put the Word of God before
[32:14] you remember David said I always put the
[32:17] Word of God before me I always put the
[32:19] Lord before me is what he said now what
[32:22] does that mean it means putting the word
[32:24] before you saying have letting the word
[32:28] have the preeminence amen when the word
[32:31] has the preeminence in there in your
[32:33] life then it's gonna be able to lead you
[32:35] and guide you into all truth praise the
[32:37] Lord Amen look what brother Branham says
[32:42] here I like cuz he talked about this and
[32:48] that the brothers bring it up faith is
[32:49] our victory he met this man one time and
[32:54] he called him a bomb and and it says
[32:58] here the brother bring it up yeah okay
[33:00] says it reminds me of one time that I
[33:03] don't like to say this word but he was
[33:05] just a bum that came to the door and he
[33:08] said could you give me a sandwich I said
[33:12] certainly would you step in and instead
[33:15] and instead of making him a sandwich I
[33:18] thought I'd fix him something to eat and
[33:20] fixed him up just about what I could
[33:22] around the place and set him down to eat
[33:25] and while he was eating I thought I
[33:27] would speak to him seeing that he was a
[33:29] traveler I said where did you come from
[33:31] he just shrugged his shoulders like a
[33:33] little and said
[33:35] no we're kind of like some people you
[33:38] asked the question huh
[33:40] sometimes you guys you asked little kids
[33:43] a question mm-hmm he just shrugged his
[33:50] shoulders a little and said nowhere I
[33:52] said then where are you going
[33:54] and he stopped eating and looked up at
[33:57] me and said nowhere he looked around and
[34:01] swallowed a big bite see he was only
[34:03] just living for the moment that's why a
[34:05] lot of people they just live for the
[34:07] moment but they have no end goal they
[34:11] don't know what they're gonna be in 10
[34:12] years they don't know where they want
[34:14] their family to be in 10 years he looked
[34:19] around and swallowed a big bite and he
[34:21] said sir just where my heart where my
[34:23] hat's resting there's where I rest in
[34:26] other words that's where I sleep I said
[34:28] I see I said how long have you been
[34:31] doing this he said oh some 20 years or
[34:33] more with no ambitions to the to to
[34:36] better his self look what he says here
[34:40] but let me tell you something tonight
[34:41] you on you on the in and outside of this
[34:44] building you're going to wind up at a
[34:46] destination one of these days that's
[34:48] going to be in the valley of the shadow
[34:50] of death now let me tell you saying is
[34:52] that that is there's nowhere for you to
[34:54] evade that your that's one destination
[34:57] that you're gonna have to face one day
[34:59] if we're still hearing then we don't go
[35:01] in ever if you're if we don't get to go
[35:03] in the rapture amen you're gonna have to
[35:05] face it one day amen I want I want that
[35:09] if I have to face death amen
[35:11] I want you have to live your life Saints
[35:13] that that live your life in such a way
[35:18] that there'd be able that they'd be able
[35:20] to say such things that you want them to
[35:22] say about you at your funeral what are
[35:27] they gonna say at your funeral or are
[35:31] they just gonna have to make up some
[35:32] things to kind of make things look good
[35:35] you know what are they gonna say about
[35:38] you that was a good man he was a godly
[35:42] man he was a godly father he was a godly
[35:45] husband that was a good woman
[35:47] that was a godly
[35:49] who loved who loved the Lord who feared
[35:51] the Lord that was a good that was a good
[35:53] kid that was a good teenager but you let
[35:55] me say teenagers also pass away little
[36:00] girls and little boys also have to go by
[36:02] the grave you're not exempt from death
[36:07] nobody is what do you want people to say
[36:11] about you amen
[36:15] you're gonna wind up at a destination
[36:17] one of these days that's going to be in
[36:19] the valley of the shadows of death I
[36:21] would advise you at this hour to prepare
[36:24] to meet the God that will have to meet
[36:25] you at that hour you'll either meet him
[36:28] as a masterpiece that he has worked on
[36:30] or a floating piece of driftwood to go
[36:33] into your final destination so don't you
[36:37] use this life just to drift around and
[36:39] float around and and get a better job
[36:42] and to dress better and to get a new
[36:45] television or a better car life means
[36:47] more than that amen oh that's not me
[36:51] saying that that's brother branham
[36:52] saying you have to have an Angolan for
[36:56] your life amen
[36:57] and I've always they've always stuck to
[36:59] me amen what do you want live your life
[37:02] exactly the way you want people to talk
[37:05] about you at your funeral amen you think
[37:09] about that Saints so some people say
[37:14] some people think that having goals is
[37:17] bad and then that you shouldn't have
[37:18] goals and that you shouldn't plan for
[37:20] life but there's nothing wrong about
[37:22] that you need to do you need to do that
[37:24] amen I may because even the Bible talks
[37:27] about having goals and plans remember
[37:29] when Jesus talked about in in in Luke
[37:32] chapter 14 he said that when a man sits
[37:35] down and counts the cost when he's gonna
[37:37] build the tower he sits down and eats he
[37:40] sees how much it's gonna cost what what
[37:43] the expenses the the out goal what the
[37:46] you know and all these different things
[37:48] he has to sit down and plan it out
[37:50] before he actually starts to build the
[37:52] tower now just build the tower just I
[37:55] haven't planned nothing out which is
[37:57] whatever I can get from Lowe's that's
[37:59] what that's what I'll do you know
[38:02] I have no money left to do that to get
[38:05] you know to get more lumber we're just
[38:07] gonna have to swipe put it on that
[38:10] credit card no plans no what no goals
[38:15] financially not nothing and you say you
[38:17] want to get married some of us I most
[38:22] want to get married and you cannot
[38:25] you're not even in the position to
[38:26] support a wife or support a husband I'm
[38:36] just being real with you all sings you
[38:38] know that's how I am and that's that's I
[38:42] want you to think about these things
[38:44] young people all we're gonna live off of
[38:47] love we just love one another laying in
[38:51] bed and just cuddle up and just that
[38:54] Moochie feeling that you know you know
[38:57] that only goes for just a little while
[38:58] that only lasts for just the well you
[39:01] still have to put food on the table you
[39:03] still have to go and work you still have
[39:06] to go and clean the house you still have
[39:08] to you know you have to do you have to
[39:10] face these things that's life but you
[39:13] know what when we have God a man in life
[39:16] amen then though I can do all things
[39:18] through Christ who strengthens me amen
[39:21] there's nothing that you'll be able to
[39:23] accomplish if you do it through Christ I
[39:26] always put the Lord before you then
[39:29] marriage won't be such a hard thing then
[39:32] life won't be such a hard thing raising
[39:34] children won't be such a hard thing amen
[39:37] amen
[39:39] praise the Lord proverbs 16:6 six
[39:43] through 11 says the scripture here talks
[39:45] about how aunts how they prepare they
[39:49] plan for the wintertime right that was
[39:53] you know so if God was so against
[39:55] planning and having a goal and and and
[39:58] and and doing in Deen these things and
[40:00] he wouldn't put these things in the
[40:01] Bible because he mean he mentions there
[40:04] in that scripture he compares to how a
[40:07] lazy person who doesn't plan ahead is
[40:11] out beaten by an ant
[40:16] how many of us can look at an ads and
[40:19] you see an app that is moving
[40:21] I've never seen an ant stay still I'll
[40:25] never look down on the ground and seen
[40:27] an ant or shaking an ant pile and seen
[40:31] the ants just sitting there let's look
[40:32] up at you well that's how some people
[40:37] are when you preach to them or when the
[40:39] word goes forth okay look up at you and
[40:43] [Laughter]
[40:46] they're not moving nothing nothing's
[40:49] changing in their life they're just
[40:50] sitting there I'm here at church I'm
[40:54] doing what I'm supposed to do saying you
[40:57] got to have more ambitions than that
[40:59] more than more than that there's more to
[41:02] life than just an ant I'll do this more
[41:12] MORE 100 percent of the time for some of
[41:15] us laziness will not take you anywhere
[41:18] you know what Saints you you wanna you
[41:22] wanna you want to get to a point where
[41:24] you want to lose some weight or
[41:25] something like that go talk to the
[41:26] person who's lost weight you want to get
[41:30] to a place where they're financially
[41:32] stable go talk to a person who's
[41:34] financially stable don't go talk to the
[41:36] person who's not financially stable

[41:42] stuff or who's who's you know who has
[41:45] who is overweight and they've lost just
[41:48] a few pounds go talk to the person who's
[41:51] lost you know if you want to get to a
[41:54] point where you were of success in life
[41:57] amen
[41:58] see what they're doing amen that's what
[42:01] I recommend for you young people amen
[42:04] and one go to go tell a man you wanna
[42:06] you want to see how a Christian a man
[42:08] huh how brother Dale Amen how he's come
[42:10] to the place where he's at go talk to
[42:12] him reading and starting constantly
[42:17] meditating and look where he's at now
[42:21] look what it's look what it's caused him
[42:23] to be a Amen
[42:27] he didn't get here he didn't get there
[42:29] just just without a plan or just without
[42:31] a end goal he had a goal in mind and his
[42:34] goal was Christ
[42:35] that should be all of our goals amen
[42:37] praise God give him brother Dale his
[42:41] flowers even though he's not here a man
[42:44] I appreciate brother Dale for that amen
[42:47] he paid he paid he paid a lot of that
[42:53] that that that is a lot of work
[42:56] amen to to sacrifice time to study the
[43:00] word not just for himself but because
[43:03] for you and I men to come to a point
[43:08] where he knows that he knows that he
[43:10] knows where he's standing in this word
[43:11] do you know that you know that you're
[43:14] where you're standing in this word or
[43:15] you're just a piece of driftwood easily
[43:18] just moved from one place to another
[43:20] like Paul said we're like the wind you
[43:24] know that carries us from one place to
[43:26] the other you know and this one believes
[43:29] this so I'm gonna just go over here
[43:32] the wind blows again I'm gonna go oh I
[43:37] believe that now then this one believes
[43:39] this and then you go over there do you
[43:41] Saints we have to know exactly what
[43:43] we're standing amen
[43:45] know this word a man is alive and it's
[43:48] it's in you it's well they men praise
[43:53] God amen
[43:59] and then proverbs 21:5 says the thoughts
[44:02] of the diligent tend only to be the
[44:05] plenty the plenteous but of everyone
[44:08] that is hasty only only to want in other
[44:11] words the thoughts of the the thoughts
[44:13] of the diligent the ones that are
[44:15] planning ahead they will come out ahead
[44:18] right Amen now saying I wanna I wanna I
[44:23] want to bring this in here that just
[44:25] because you're planning just because
[44:27] your your your you have a goal doesn't
[44:30] always necessarily mean that you might
[44:31] get there and the reason why is because
[44:33] the Bible says the Lord the God orders
[44:36] the steps of man you might have an end
[44:40] goal but really in reality is God the
[44:43] one who steps your your life who orders
[44:45] your life right now you may be involved
[44:48] in something right now you may be doing
[44:50] something you might have an end goal but
[44:52] in reality God's the one who has the
[44:55] final say-so
[44:56] amen I'll put it like this Saints when I
[45:00] was in school when I was just graduated
[45:02] from high school and that was back in
[45:05] 1999 but I just graduated from high
[45:09] school in started going to college and I
[45:12] thought that I wanted to go in and do
[45:15] photography and graphic arts because I
[45:18] was good at it I took that in school and
[45:20] I was good at it even my teacher my
[45:22] graphic arts teacher told me she was the
[45:24] photography teacher as well she said and
[45:26] you're good you're good I have an eye
[45:29] for photography and and things like that
[45:33] and and I went to this certain school in
[45:37] Greenville South Carolina went there
[45:40] started doing my class I was I was
[45:42] excited I liked thinking man one day I
[45:44] may get to go work for National
[45:46] Geographic the magazine you know
[45:49] oh man that are the awesome you know
[45:51] able to go travel although because I
[45:53] love traveling you know that I love to
[45:55] go travel and I love seeing these exotic
[45:59] spots and and be in dangerous situations
[46:02] be able to take a pictures of of a pygmy
[46:05] in the end or something like that you
[46:07] know and that's what I wanted
[46:12] but then when I got there and started in
[46:14] school for about a week or two three
[46:18] weeks late later I had to take this
[46:19] drawing class with it now I'm not a good
[46:22] I don't draw good all right now that my
[46:26] wife does better at drawing she's good
[46:28] at in Bella and evens oh he's picking it
[46:31] up good really good I'm glad they did
[46:34] cuz I just don't do it well and I had to
[46:38] take this drawing class and we have to
[46:40] have this man come in in the middle of
[46:42] the class some old older man I would say
[46:46] he was older gray hair almost burnt skin
[46:52] because of all the the tanning beds that
[46:55] probably he goes to orange wrinkly skin
[47:00] there in the middle of the classroom in
[47:03] us in like a speedo type of thing a
[47:06] bikini
[47:08] shirtless everything that's all he was
[47:10] in there in the middle of class and I
[47:12] had to sit there and draw this man in a
[47:14] certain position you know and we all had
[47:20] to be there in a minute now I'm seeing
[47:21] this half-naked man in the middle and
[47:23] I'm a Christian I just come into the
[47:25] message at that time I'm like no I can't
[47:29] do this and then what's worse is that in
[47:33] the photography class I was taken they
[47:36] to them you know to people in the world
[47:39] they think that the you know showing
[47:40] nude women and things like that is art
[47:42] but I thought you know I didn't feel
[47:45] comfortable with that and that's what
[47:47] they were showing me show me you know
[47:48] take pictures of nude women and things
[47:50] like that and I had to just quit you
[47:53] know what what I thought was my goal
[47:54] what I thought that's what I wanted to
[47:56] be I had to quickly make a choice and
[47:58] say you know what that's not for me
[48:00] that's not for me because my soul my
[48:06] soul was worth more than just that you
[48:08] know and so I got into because I've
[48:11] always liked computers as well and then
[48:13] I got into web development web designing
[48:15] and started building websites and all
[48:16] those different things and now I am
[48:18] where I'm at probably would not have met
[48:21] my wife probably where would I be if I
[48:23] were to continue with that class
[48:25] and maybe gotten a job at some magazine
[48:27] company and in Los Angeles somewhere or
[48:30] something and never would have met my
[48:32] wife never would have had my children
[48:33] never would have been here God's the one
[48:37] who orders your steps God's the one who
[48:40] has the final say-so
[48:41] amen so you might have a goal in your
[48:44] life that's fine if it's godly go ahead
[48:47] you there's nothing wrong with
[48:49] photography there's nothing wrong with
[48:51] with with drawing and graphic arts but
[48:55] then god they said wait a second I have
[48:58] something better for you
[48:59] matter of fact that just happened to one
[49:01] of my one of my nieces up in Canada she
[49:04] was wanting to go to a certain she's
[49:06] going to college as well she's
[49:07] graduating this year from high school
[49:08] she was going to college
[49:09] like two or three hours away in Waterloo
[49:13] in Ontario she was gonna be sleep over
[49:17] there at a dorm and things like that and
[49:19] the course that she wanted she couldn't
[49:21] get she was a she was capable she had
[49:24] the grades for it everything she was not
[49:26] able to get it she came to she came to
[49:28] us telling us asking us for prayer she
[49:30] feels bad and upset well just a few days
[49:33] later just a few days later I told her I
[49:35] sent her something I said you know God's
[49:37] what is it what is it yeah God's no is
[49:44] not a rejection it's a redirection all
[49:48] right and sometimes his no is not not
[49:53] because he hates you he's just trying to
[49:55] redirect you to a better route amen and
[49:58] so and so now she got a dis offer at the
[50:01] University of Toronto only like 30
[50:04] minutes 35 minutes from her house in the
[50:07] in exactly what she wanted to be and
[50:09] they're giving her a scholarship to go
[50:11] to the cook to the school way better
[50:13] than what she thought I want to go to
[50:15] Waterloo you know and this was this is
[50:17] much better deal you see so Saints it's
[50:20] always just God knows best all right
[50:23] Amen God know best let me continue amen
[50:27] praise God amen so man town was just Ron
[50:33] ba
[50:34] so so saying you have to have goals and
[50:37] you have these goals but make them out
[50:39] with humility knowing hey wait a second
[50:42] I'm planning this out I'm doing this I'm
[50:43] there but just as James says I'm James
[50:46] chapters four chapter four verse 13 says
[50:49] go to now ye that say today or tomorrow
[50:52] we will go into such a city and continue
[50:55] there a year and buy and sell and get
[50:57] gained in other words I have these plans
[50:59] I'm gonna do this that and the other I'm
[51:01] gonna be in business where as you know
[51:03] now what shall be on the morrow in other
[51:06] words you don't know what's gonna happen
[51:07] tomorrow right so it's not it's not it's
[51:11] not a James James here is the Bible says
[51:15] to plan but at the same time James here
[51:18] is bringing out plan with humility plan
[51:21] knowing that that you're open to the
[51:24] fact that God changed my plan if you
[51:27] need to write plan in that way change my
[51:33] course if you need to for what's better
[51:36] for me for my soul because my soul is
[51:38] worth more than just this right plan for
[51:43] me amen that God you can change if you I
[51:45] can change be flexible in other words
[51:49] whereas you know not what shall be under
[51:51] morrow for what is your life it is even
[51:54] a vapor that appears for a little time
[51:56] and then vanisheth away that's what our
[52:00] life is we're here for just a little
[52:03] time so just make the bet the most out
[52:06] of that time amen
[52:08] live your life for God live your life
[52:11] for Christ don't live your life for
[52:13] things don't live your life for for him
[52:15] or don't live your life for her don't
[52:18] live your life for this that or the
[52:19] other a man live your life for Christ so
[52:21] that everything else will come out right
[52:23] amen praise the Lord so it's good to
[52:29] make plans as long as we leave room for
[52:31] God to change our plans his goals take
[52:33] precedence over ours amen we have our
[52:40] Dia's to make our plans but God will
[52:42] ultimately accomplish his sovereign
[52:43] desires amen
[52:44] now look what Paul says here Paul's
[52:47] clear-cut goals
[52:48] his life amen if they could bring
[52:50] Philippians chapter 3 amen
[52:53] remember sayings what is your aim in
[52:55] life what is your aim in life but what
[53:00] things were gain to me those I counted
[53:02] loss for Christ you doubtless and I
[53:04] count all things but loss for the
[53:07] excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[53:08] Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered
[53:11] the loss of all things and do count them
[53:14] but dung that here's one of his first
[53:17] goals that I may win Christ in other
[53:21] words I count all these things around me
[53:24] these past things that I was involved in
[53:27] I count him as dung
[53:29] you know what dung is it's I don't have
[53:32] to explain it
[53:34] shoo-shoo that I may win Christ and be
[53:41] found in him here's another one of his
[53:43] goals and be found in him not having
[53:45] mine own righteousness which is of the
[53:47] law but that which is through the faith
[53:50] of Christ the righteousness which is of
[53:52] God by faith
[53:54] here's another goal of his that I may
[53:57] know him and the power of his
[53:59] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[54:03] sufferings everything that that that
[54:05] that that Paul was involved in it was
[54:09] for this purposes ultimately is for to
[54:13] win Christ not to be rich not to be not
[54:17] to have a big house in the middle of a
[54:19] Atlanta or or something like that that's
[54:22] fine that's nice but that shouldn't be
[54:24] your end goal or to own some some luxury
[54:28] vehicle or something like that's great I
[54:30] love cars but that shouldn't be your end
[54:33] goal in life that I may know him in the
[54:37] power of his resurrection and the
[54:39] Fellowship of his sufferings and that I
[54:41] may own a Bentley and B doesn't say that
[54:47] right being made comfortable unto his
[54:50] death if by any means I might attain
[54:52] unto the resurrection of the Dead yes I
[54:56] believe that's the Brides
[54:57] goal amen to be able to obtain the
[55:00] resurrection of the
[55:02] man not as though I had already attained
[55:05] either we're already perfect but I
[55:08] follow after if that I may apprehend
[55:12] that for which I am also apprehended of
[55:15] Christ Jesus in other words I want to
[55:17] hold on to what has held on to me
[55:20] amen Christ is the one that's been
[55:23] keeping you in this hour
[55:25] your your where you are thank for mommy
[55:29] and daddy thanks for for for your
[55:32] upbringing but it's ultimately been God
[55:35] you know sometimes we when you when we
[55:39] tell our children when we were sitting
[55:40] down to eat why do we pray for our food
[55:43] you're asked that question because
[55:47] ultimately that food was grown not by
[55:50] mommy and daddy mommy and daddy maybe
[55:54] planted the seed watered it but God was
[55:58] the one who gave the increase
[55:59] God was the one who put those green
[56:02] beans together those carrots together I
[56:05] can't do that neither can you
[56:07] and scientists still to this day don't
[56:09] know how to create a blade of grass but
[56:13] yet grass is out there it's God amen
[56:16] praise God so that's the reason why we
[56:21] we say grace we bless our food we to
[56:23] thank the Lord God for providing through
[56:26] my mom and dad this food that I mean
[56:29] because if you didn't give mommy and
[56:31] daddy the ability to work amen the
[56:34] health to go work then we would not have
[56:37] this food on our table right I'm just
[56:40] trying to be practical with our children
[56:41] they meant that's the reason why we say
[56:43] blessing over the table that's why we
[56:46] say grace amen if that I may apprehend
[56:51] that for which also I am apprehended of
[56:53] Christ Jesus brethren I count on myself
[56:55] to have apprehended but this one thing I
[56:57] do forgetting those things which are
[56:59] behind and reaching forth unto those
[57:01] things which are before man you know
[57:05] that word pol he's reaching for those
[57:07] things which are before a head of him
[57:09] because that's his end goal right I
[57:12] press toward the mark of the prize of
[57:14] the high calling
[57:15] God in Christ Jesus a man of God in
[57:17] Christ Jesus amen that's what we should
[57:20] be pressing for Saints is the price is
[57:23] the mark of the price of the mark of the
[57:25] high calling a man we're just trying to
[57:27] move on here amen
[57:29] so Saints you know somebody said one
[57:35] time said people are where they are
[57:37] because that is exactly where they
[57:40] really want to be whether they will
[57:45] admit that or not
[57:47] you are where you are right now because
[57:49] that's where you want to be otherwise
[57:52] you'd be somewhere else you otherwise
[57:55] you'd be you'd be doing something else
[57:56] otherwise you'd be thinking in a
[57:58] different way but sometimes we like to
[58:03] just just kind of cozy up to certain
[58:06] spirits and play the victim card and
[58:11] then and and poor me nobody likes me
[58:14] poor me nobody wants to do this with me
[58:18] nobody wants here oh you know what
[58:21] Saints me nobody here in this church not
[58:25] even brother Dale can force you to get
[58:27] to a point where you are now not even
[58:29] the devil can do it it's your own
[58:32] decision the devil comes and knocks on
[58:35] the door but you're the one who has to
[58:37] open say I'm gonna open up where I'm
[58:39] gonna close devil's not gonna rob me of
[58:42] my happiness Devils not gonna rob me of
[58:44] my of my joy Devils not gonna rob me of
[58:47] my of my fellowship with Christ amen
[58:50] you're the one who decides a few where
[58:53] you're gonna wait and if you like the
[58:55] spirit that you that you live in now
[58:57] you're gonna continue to be in that you
[59:00] just continue to just rub that spirit o
[59:06] spirit
[59:08] I love you
[59:11] and it'll just sit there it won't move
[59:18] then when we play the victim card then
[59:21] that comes the blame game somebody
[59:23] else's fault now my fault it's somebody
[59:26] else's fault that I am where I am you
[59:29] know what the the people that are out
[59:31] protesting out in against the 1% you
[59:34] know back a couple of years ago where
[59:37] they are at where they at now they were
[59:39] upset because people were people you
[59:43] know wealthy people who I believe they
[59:45] didn't get there just by getting there
[59:47] they had end goals they they worked hard
[59:50] you know you sit on saying they didn't
[59:54] just get to become wealthy you know just
[59:55] just so I woke up one day and just
[59:57] there's a pile of money in my living
[59:59] room no they they had an end goal but
[1:00:03] people were upset at them they're taking
[1:00:06] all our money and all this kind of stuff
[1:00:08] and where they're at now you see if you
[1:00:13] do exactly what they are doing you'd be
[1:00:15] there too but they want somebody to just
[1:00:20] Kate or something just for them so that
[1:00:25] they can be happy you know that's not
[1:00:27] how life is that's not how life is
[1:00:29] saying you have a part to play and you
[1:00:33] only gonna reap what you saw amen
[1:00:36] as a man thinks in his heart so is he
[1:00:40] amen that's why Christ said let this
[1:00:43] mind said let this mind of Christ being
[1:00:45] you amen
[1:00:46] remember one part when when when God
[1:00:49] said at the beginning let there be
[1:00:51] remember and there was right but before
[1:00:55] they had to be in his thoughts first
[1:00:57] right he had to think about it first
[1:00:59] before I become expressed and whatever
[1:01:02] is in your thoughts right now if
[1:01:04] whatever it is that you're thinking
[1:01:06] about right now whatever it is that you
[1:01:09] hold hold dear in your heart right now
[1:01:12] that's the atmosphere that you're gonna
[1:01:14] correct or create around your life so if
[1:01:21] you're constantly thinking everybody's
[1:01:22] against you
[1:01:23] and you're constantly thinking that
[1:01:25] everybody's after you and everybody's
[1:01:27] after trying to do something against you
[1:01:28] and trying to be trying to that's what
[1:01:33] you're going to portray because that's
[1:01:35] what you're thinking about constantly
[1:01:37] it's in your mind that's why the Bible
[1:01:40] says for as he thinketh in his heart so
[1:01:42] is he eaten drinks have to thee but his
[1:01:46] heart is not with thee that's just the
[1:01:51] law of God amen
[1:01:54] so this hangs that's what we want to
[1:01:56] always have this mind of Christ being us
[1:01:59] how do we get the mind of Christ that's
[1:02:01] why I read the scripture early to let
[1:02:03] not this word of God the apart from you
[1:02:05] day and night
[1:02:06] but meditate on a day and night and if
[1:02:10] you don't do that everything else around
[1:02:12] you is going to hold to your thoughts
[1:02:13] and everything everybody's against you
[1:02:16] everybody's after you everybody try to
[1:02:17] do something against you and that's not
[1:02:19] it if the mind of Christ was in you if
[1:02:24] you were constantly feeding on the word
[1:02:25] feeding on the message feeding on what's
[1:02:27] preached a man at church amen you
[1:02:30] wouldn't have room to think these things
[1:02:32] there won't be no room to think
[1:02:34] somebody's out against me somebody
[1:02:36] trying to do harm to me somebody's doing
[1:02:38] it and nobody doesn't want to do this or
[1:02:40] that with me Amen see because God's
[1:02:47] thoughts Amen were the one that his
[1:02:49] thoughts created an atmosphere created
[1:02:52] the what the world is that we have right
[1:02:54] and if the Spirit of Christ is in you
[1:02:57] amen
[1:02:58] and you're thinking his thoughts it'll
[1:03:00] create those exact same atmospheres my
[1:03:03] goodness what a hard concept to grasp
[1:03:07] but it's not hard right you reap what
[1:03:12] you sow Amen praise
[1:03:20] you know Saints I'll give you this
[1:03:24] example we got we got a little bit more
[1:03:26] time just bear with me coming back to
[1:03:30] that I have this I have this router at
[1:03:35] my house is a router that where Internet
[1:03:38] pipes in you know to to the house and
[1:03:40] gives me Kate Wi-Fi right and I have it
[1:03:45] set on there to where there's a default
[1:03:48] way when you connect a device to it
[1:03:51] there's a default settings that nobody's
[1:03:54] gonna be just able to access anything
[1:03:56] YouTube or whatever just just you know
[1:03:59] that to have an open Internet just I
[1:04:01] have certain settings that closer and
[1:04:03] things down and stuff like that and I
[1:04:06] have to manually go in there and set
[1:04:08] certain devices when they connect to my
[1:04:11] Wi-Fi router right to have a certain
[1:04:15] level of security now maybe some of you
[1:04:18] some of the older people are like what
[1:04:20] is he talking about Oh security router
[1:04:24] what is it that
[1:04:25] oh yeah the younger people probably know
[1:04:27] what I'm talking about right one time I
[1:04:32] had this little Bluetooth light bulb
[1:04:34] that I bought like just a couple of
[1:04:36] months ago that I wanted to put outside
[1:04:40] that I kit was gonna connect to the
[1:04:43] internet and I could manually turn off
[1:04:45] the the outside light that light bulb
[1:04:47] with my phone and and and it have come
[1:04:50] on on its own at a certain time and turn
[1:04:52] off at a certain time and stuff like
[1:04:54] that a complete complete control of it
[1:04:56] and I for I could not get that thing to
[1:05:00] connect properly to my router and you
[1:05:03] know to to connect properly to work
[1:05:05] properly to make a long story short we
[1:05:09] waited several months and finally it
[1:05:12] done to me wait a second I need to go
[1:05:15] into my router settings and and look for
[1:05:18] it and set the the the default security
[1:05:22] mode to just open you know so that it
[1:05:25] have access to the to the internet and
[1:05:27] sure enough exactly when I did that the
[1:05:30] things started working
[1:05:33] now the problem was locally in my house
[1:05:36] I thought I had even called the company
[1:05:38] I got to the point where where I'd
[1:05:41] called the company and I said hey your
[1:05:43] bulb isn't working can you please send
[1:05:44] me a replacement and they were gonna
[1:05:46] send me a replacement but you know what
[1:05:49] if I had gotten a replacement it would
[1:05:51] have done the same thing because the
[1:05:53] problem was local to my home the problem
[1:05:56] was in my house amen now you know what
[1:06:00] I'm going to come becoming Saints the
[1:06:03] problem sometimes is not elsewhere the
[1:06:06] problem sometimes it's local to our
[1:06:08] house the problems sometimes might be
[1:06:11] you thinking that it's somebody else
[1:06:14] when in reality it's you that you're
[1:06:17] your light bulb isn't lighting up you
[1:06:24] blame everybody else for the person for
[1:06:27] the state that you're in but really in
[1:06:30] reality God's trying to say you know
[1:06:31] what you're the problem
[1:06:33] change your thoughts change your mindset
[1:06:36] come to me come to the Lord and I will
[1:06:39] take care of the rest that you're that
[1:06:43] you could be the problem you could be
[1:06:45] the hindrance to the church and not know
[1:06:48] it I could be the hindrance to the
[1:06:50] church and not know it
[1:06:52] oh no I've been in the message for 40
[1:06:56] years they can't be me
[1:07:01] that has nothing to do is the message
[1:07:03] has to be in you just because you have
[1:07:07] the message here doesn't mean that the
[1:07:08] message is here you're just probably
[1:07:10] just like driftwood going through the
[1:07:12] motions amen and Saints the way we go if
[1:07:18] we have children it's the way our
[1:07:20] children are gonna go they watch us if
[1:07:23] your children doesn't pay attention in
[1:07:25] church then they're just sitting there
[1:07:28] just kind of like oh this is another
[1:07:30] service you know and things like that is
[1:07:37] that what you do not paying attention
[1:07:44] not thinking one thing what am i doing
[1:07:48] for God you know a preacher or even
[1:07:53] brother Dale bore the weight anybody
[1:07:54] won't be able to help you if you don't
[1:07:56] think that they can help you if you
[1:07:59] already have in your mind said I'm not
[1:08:01] listening to this person I'm closing off
[1:08:03] I'm not you know there's nothing that he
[1:08:05] can he's not he's not a popular preacher
[1:08:08] he's not brother Dale he's not brother
[1:08:11] Wade well then you're not gonna get any
[1:08:14] benefit and if you only come to church
[1:08:16] just when brother Dale is here
[1:08:18] something's wrong with you something's
[1:08:21] wrong with your experience or when just
[1:08:24] a popular preacher of famous preachers
[1:08:26] coming through oh brother jewel comes
[1:08:28] through the house is packed even on a
[1:08:31] Wednesday brother Lewis is preaching or
[1:08:37] somebody else one of the local brothers
[1:08:39] here is preaching oh and we can miss out
[1:08:41] that day now I understand Saints um
[1:08:48] there's some people traveling and stuff
[1:08:49] like that but you know what things I
[1:08:51] speak out our experience because I've
[1:08:53] had that attitude as well before I went
[1:08:57] on our love loved it when I went to
[1:08:59] church and it was one of the good
[1:09:01] ministers old man brother Donny Reagan's
[1:09:03] preaching and oh man you know brother
[1:09:05] Bisco oh man not all of them good you
[1:09:07] know no and then when my pastor was
[1:09:12] preaching
[1:09:20] then the Word of God won't be able to
[1:09:23] help you in life so what is your aim in
[1:09:25] life Saints what is your aim in life
[1:09:28] there's a lot of material here that I
[1:09:30] that I haven't covered but Saints
[1:09:34] brother Brennan says here no matter how
[1:09:38] good you are how moral you are how
[1:09:40] truthful you are those things are
[1:09:43] respected but jesus said except a man be
[1:09:45] born again see there's got to be
[1:09:47] something happen on the inside if you
[1:09:49] don't that's artificial put on for down
[1:09:53] in your heart you desire to do it anyhow
[1:09:55] it can't be artificial it's got to be
[1:09:58] real and there's only one Avenue that
[1:10:01] that can come down and that's by the way
[1:10:03] of free moral agency come into the soul
[1:10:06] by your thoughts as a man thinketh in
[1:10:09] his heart so is he
[1:10:10] if you say to this mountain move and
[1:10:12] don't doubt it in your heart but believe
[1:10:14] that what you have said will come to
[1:10:15] pass you can have what you said you get
[1:10:17] it there you are see there's the
[1:10:20] battlegrounds if you'd only get to that
[1:10:23] get that started first so whatever you
[1:10:27] think about that's what you are and that
[1:10:29] is what you'll become more of if you're
[1:10:32] still living right now if you're still
[1:10:33] alive you have an opportunity to have a
[1:10:35] mindset change the grace of the Lord the
[1:10:40] mercy of the Lord is is with you change
[1:10:43] your mindset to the word amen praise God
[1:10:47] so here's that here's the key to success
[1:10:50] young people he's the key to success
[1:10:57] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:11:00] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[1:11:05] therein day and night that thou mayst
[1:11:07] observe to do according to all that is
[1:11:09] written therein for then thou shalt make
[1:11:11] thy way prosperous and then thou shalt
[1:11:14] have good success that's the key to not
[1:11:19] just success but good success stay in
[1:11:23] the word put the Word of God always
[1:11:24] before you you know what Saints a lot of
[1:11:27] people in this life run this running
[1:11:30] this life like as if they're running on
[1:11:31] a treadmill
[1:11:33] they've been on a treadmill you know
[1:11:35] what a treadmill is sometimes get on the
[1:11:39] treadmill and we stop again on a
[1:11:41] treadmill because we don't I don't see
[1:11:43] results though well we're running on
[1:11:46] this life on a treadmill but we're not
[1:11:51] gaining any ground or not you're running
[1:11:57] you're doing everything you're sweating
[1:12:00] but man that just doesn't change that
[1:12:04] that's not that doesn't replace you
[1:12:06] going outside to run you see you see
[1:12:11] everything and you know that you're
[1:12:12] gaining ground you know that at a
[1:12:14] certain point when I get to a certain
[1:12:16] point I'll stop right there when I see a
[1:12:18] certain landmark I'll stop right there
[1:12:20] but some of us are just running lives on
[1:12:23] a treadmills and don't know where we're
[1:12:25] going don't know where we've been don't
[1:12:27] know what's going on but we're running
[1:12:29] I'm following the other one where we're
[1:12:32] not following the leader we're following
[1:12:33] the follower just following the follower
[1:12:38] that's all we do in life nice I want to
[1:12:42] follow the leader and our leader is
[1:12:44] Christ amen our leader is Christ keep
[1:12:48] her eyes on remember that story the
[1:12:49] brother branham told about told about
[1:12:51] that boy who was in that race and he was
[1:12:54] he was competing with and though some of
[1:12:58] them boys were like making fun of him
[1:13:00] they're like huh
[1:13:00] you're not gonna win look at the kind of
[1:13:02] bite that you have I think a puny little
[1:13:06] thing look at it I got this theory this
[1:13:08] thing here man I could cost me $1,800 I
[1:13:11] got this thing man wasn't nicely decked
[1:13:15] out and everything you know this thing
[1:13:16] he's like okay we'll see you keep
[1:13:19] talking I don't keep I'm just gonna I'm
[1:13:21] here for the race little boy gets on the
[1:13:23] bike starts running the race goes on
[1:13:27] here they go mm-hmm like the tour of the
[1:13:30] Front's and you know what Saints
[1:13:34] everybody else started falling out they
[1:13:38] couldn't make it but that one boy made
[1:13:41] it and then they asked him he's the one
[1:13:43] who ended up winning the race and they
[1:13:45] asked him
[1:13:46] did you win the race you you have you
[1:13:48] don't have the good bike like everybody
[1:13:51] else you don't have they said I just
[1:13:53] kept my mind towards my eyes towards the
[1:13:55] goal the whole time and if we keep our
[1:14:00] eyes set on Christ the whole time you're
[1:14:03] gonna come out to be like Christ Saints
[1:14:05] you're not gonna come out to be like
[1:14:07] LeBron James you think you're gonna come
[1:14:10] out to be like LeBron James if you keep
[1:14:11] your mind on Christ I don't want to be
[1:14:13] like LeBron James you think you could
[1:14:15] come out to be like like like a certain
[1:14:17] movie star or a certain pop singer you
[1:14:19] know I mean the vato or whatever their
[1:14:22] their name is Justin Bieber and all
[1:14:24] these different if you keep your mind on
[1:14:27] Christ you think that's what you're
[1:14:28] gonna be like no because if you have set
[1:14:31] your mind to be like Christ you're not
[1:14:34] gonna want to be like the rest of the
[1:14:35] world amen
[1:14:37] you're gonna come to out to be like
[1:14:39] Christ so Saints what is your aim in
[1:14:41] life what are you aiming for in life
[1:14:43] because whatever you aim for that's what
[1:14:46] you'll hit whatever you aim for that's
[1:14:50] what you'll hit have a plan in your life
[1:14:54] physically spiritually have goals in
[1:14:58] your life amen because remember people
[1:15:04] that doesn't have a goal people without
[1:15:07] a goal people without a vision they'll
[1:15:09] perish the Bible says that amen you love
[1:15:13] the Lord praise the Lord it was a lot
[1:15:15] more here that I had that I could say
[1:15:16] maybe there'll be a part to another time
[1:15:18] but but uh I want you all to think on
[1:15:22] these things now let me let me finish it
[1:15:25] with this with this quote I wanted to
[1:15:29] read they have it up it's the one I
[1:15:33] didn't number them let's see here okay
[1:15:39] it's the one that says faith is our
[1:15:41] victory now there's so many people all
[1:15:45] right down here now there's so many
[1:15:48] people that doesn't seem to have any
[1:15:50] kind of a purpose in life especially in
[1:15:53] this day that we now live people just
[1:15:56] seem to think that all they have to do
[1:15:57] is to keep up with somebody else with
[1:15:59] the fashion
[1:16:00] of the world and with the enticements
[1:16:02] that the world has given to them just
[1:16:05] like this if you go to school and some
[1:16:07] of the little girls wear a certain
[1:16:08] little frock or a dress or whatever you
[1:16:11] would call it all the ambition the rest
[1:16:14] of the school has its to pattern after
[1:16:15] that girl some of the women's see on the
[1:16:18] television some certain lady come out
[1:16:20] and dressed in a certain fashion well
[1:16:23] that's their ambition is to dress and to
[1:16:25] act like that and that seems to be just
[1:16:27] about the limit of the American ambition
[1:16:29] is to get a new job or to get a raise in
[1:16:32] your salary and to get a television or a
[1:16:34] new car let me say this those things may
[1:16:38] be all right but there's higher
[1:16:40] ambitions in the human life than those
[1:16:41] things and Christians should set their
[1:16:44] affection on higher ambitions I think it
[1:16:47] would pay us all to sit down and wonder
[1:16:50] why we are here in the first place and
[1:16:52] ever who was kind enough to bring us
[1:16:55] here which is God we ought to consider
[1:16:58] it and ask him what he would have us to
[1:17:01] do then the the purpose of us coming to
[1:17:06] fulfill what he has purposed for us but
[1:17:10] we seem to be just wanting to keep up
[1:17:12] with the world
[1:17:14] now the Bible said that we could
[1:17:16] overcome the world and how do we do it
[1:17:18] not by keeping up with the fashions of
[1:17:20] the world but the Bible said that faith
[1:17:22] is the victory that overcomes the world
[1:17:24] amen now I can give you that quote if
[1:17:28] you wanted but I think that's very
[1:17:29] that's very appropriate for all of us
[1:17:31] what is your aim in life amen let's
[1:17:35] stand to our feet as how the musicians
[1:17:36] come
[1:17:50] let's just sing that song just to be
[1:17:52] like Jesus but just to be like Jesus
[1:17:59] amen praise the Lord you love the Lord
[1:18:05] did you have your toast stomped on I
[1:18:10] stomp on my toes whenever I'm studying
[1:18:13] yeah yeah because listen you have to
[1:18:17] look at this things yourself and be
[1:18:19] convicted yourself and say wait a second
[1:18:21] I'm not Lord help me in this area before
[1:18:25] I can you know you can actually say it
[1:18:27] to the people the Saints I don't say
[1:18:29] these things out of hate despite or
[1:18:31] anything else I say it out of love
[1:18:33] because I want the best for you
[1:18:35] especially young people I want the best
[1:18:38] for you I want you you're our future if
[1:18:41] there is a future left to be here
[1:18:43] there's any more any more years for us
[1:18:46] to be here you're all we have I'm
[1:18:52] getting you know I'm getting older on
[1:18:53] the you know I'm not as old as some of
[1:18:55] you but I'm getting older I'm I'm gonna
[1:19:00] I'm not gonna be able to be there you
[1:19:02] know forever and I need some of you
[1:19:05] young people to be spiritually minded to
[1:19:09] take this word continue to take this
[1:19:11] word amen because that's what that's
[1:19:14] what matters is this word nothing else
[1:19:17] in this life matters but what we do for
[1:19:19] Christ or what we do for others that's
[1:19:22] the only things that we're gonna take in
[1:19:24] this life oh you feel so good when
[1:19:27] you've gotten a certain little toy or a
[1:19:30] certain little gadget or a brand new car
[1:19:32] or something like that that that just
[1:19:34] makes you feel so good it gives you that
[1:19:37] that that dose of dopamine you know for
[1:19:39] for just a little while that doesn't
[1:19:42] last
[1:19:43] but man it feels so wonderful when you
[1:19:46] live your life for others when you when
[1:19:49] you when you when you do something for
[1:19:52] someone when you live when you sacrifice
[1:19:55] yourself for someone and you're taking
[1:19:58] the Word of God and saying Lord I'm
[1:20:01] doing this because the Bible says do it
[1:20:03] as unto the Lord oh my that that gives
[1:20:08] me eternal dopa me hey man that's that's
[1:20:12] what I was let's just sing that just to
[1:20:14] be like Jesus do to be like chief you
