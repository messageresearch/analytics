hopefully re uh uh strengthen some things praise the lord and amen encourage your heart invite you over here to ephesians chapter two and we'll let you be seated praise god after we read god's word here appreciate the word of the lord amen i'm so glad god sent this message in these last days where would we be without the message where would we be without the opening of the word amen praise god in ephesians chapter 2 you just read verse 4 to verse 6. it says but god who is rich in mercy for his great love or with he loved us amen that love and that capstone right there right even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and hath raised us up together yesterday we talked about shiloh and the seventh seal and the point that i was trying to make is that when the mystery of the seventh seal opens that's where the elect are gathered by that opening of that mystery and shiloh is a gathering place so that's why i was connecting that to the seventh seal and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus amen that gathering place in christ amen dear heavenly father god as we have just read your word lord we ask for your holy spirit to come quicken it to our hearts lord and help us to recognize our true place and our position in you father said we might be completely subjected lord god and just so take us into your hands father and use us in these closing hours of the gentile dispensation help us to be made ready father god we pray in jesus christ mighty name amen amen god bless you be seated just love and appreciate you all so much i would like to also direct your attention something i didn't tell the brothers this but matthew chapter 8 will kind of go along with the point that we're going to try to make here now we know that adoption is a mighty important subject amen coming into position coming into your placing amen in matthew chapter 8 jesus has an encounter with a centurion a servant from a centurion and uh jesus made a statement he marveled at the faith of the centurion and in verse 8 the centurion answered and said lord i'm not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for i am a man under authority amen i'm a man under authority so the thing that we want to title this little sharing with you today is uh the power or the authority to translate without death okay now we know brother brown said to be presumptuous means to adventure without authority amen so you got to have authority right but that authority is based upon the word of god the authority is based upon a scriptural authority amen so we're taught now in these last days that it's impossible to have the correct kind of faith if you don't know the hour that you're living in if you don't know what part of the word god has manifested in the hour that you live in your faith cannot be appropriated correctly for like the days of noah he knew it was revealed to him it was time to build an ark but that wouldn't work in the days of moses moses was to bring in exodus that was a part of the word he was fulfilled in that day amen so it's impossible to really have real faith unless you know what part of the word god's manifesting the day that you're living in we as message people are so blessed to have what we have today because god has showed us what has been what it's all been brought up to and what the very next step is amen we know we're living at the very end of the gentile dispensation and god has showed us by the opening of this word here what part of the word we're living in amen so it's by scriptural authority we can declare we're living in last days people say well they said they was living in the last days 500 years ago but now we've had the opening of the seven seals jesus christ has descended from heaven with a shout out with the little book open in his hand amen and now we know we're living in the last days the last of the last days it's at the end time jesus does this amen so this centurion tells the lord he says that i am for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he does it when jesus heard it he marveled right the man knew about position the man knew about his placing he knew about how to exercise the authority that he had because he understood the position that he was in he knew how the authority went down and he knew how the authority worked coming from above is that right so jesus marveled at this and jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily i send you i have not found so great faith no not in israel this was a gentile that understood that jesus was exercising authority so our lord jesus christ had to be under authority amen do you know god himself won't even cross his own word that's right god stays with his own word and jesus stayed with the scripture jesus came to do exactly what the father sent him to do so jesus himself was subjected to the word and so much that our lord as his custom was went into the synagogue where he was brought up in nazareth and it was handed to him the book of the scroll of isaiah amen and we all know what happened he read the specific part of the scripture that was applied to that very hour and he stopped at a certain point because the rest of it in isaiah 61 was applied for another day but the lord jesus christ knew what part was written of him in that very hour to be fulfilled at that very time now that's pretty good that's authority that's knowing where your what your position is amen so there's a quote here in marriage in divorce and we get the brothers to bring that up there it's uh paragraph 143. no i'm sorry 144. the part we got highlighted right here he says but the real saints of god looks for the character of the vindicated word the character of the vindicated word that's what the saints did in that day when they seen jesus he wasn't nothing to look at but they seen god was in him they seen god was with him so the real saints of god look for the character of the vindicated word amen vindicated word meaning the word being fulfilled the word coming to pass the light that's shining in the hour that you live in is the vindicated word that's what the real saints of god look for a real child of god is made to realize what part of the word is manifested in the age that they live in amen this is connected to us operate in our exercise and authority brother braham said it's spiritual revelation on the word that gives you authority over the devil is that right so i couldn't exercise much authority if i stand up here and try to deliver a message from martin luther huh if i say bless god we're all lutherans i'd be way off base right because that part was already made up is that right so the secret things of god has been hidden in this word that's right right but these things that was hidden in the word has been brought out in these last days is that right and it's those hidden things that's brought to the end time brian it gives her this authority okay so we realize how incredible this is by the way because the spoken words the original seed and if there's mysteries hidden in the bible what way does god have to bring those mysteries out of the written word amen amen by speaking them right like when abraham and sarah would turn back young again nobody knew that that was hidden in the word but god anointed a prophet to speak it under the holy ghost influence and now when he speaks it you take it and look in the word and you even you even see how it's true it happened twice she was an old lady and she went down there and the king lusted after her beauty right right but that was hidden in the word right but how is it that that which is hidden is brought out right it's when the prophet speaks it under the anointing of the spirit and you're supposed to be hearing it under the anointing of the spirit you know what i suggest if you don't if you don't have it find a way to get you one of those ipods and load all those sermons on there and just play it constantly in your house because that holy ghost is speaking speaking things right out of this word right here that unlocks scripture right now is that right and that's where the love letter is in between the lines amen and that's where you get authority amen amen so you have this example of serpent seed nobody really could understand certain seed correctly until god spoke it through his prophet that's right amen amen god said right there i'll put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed well thy seed he's speaking to the serpent the serpent had a seed he says it right there in the word but wasn't brought out there until somebody got anointed and spoke it spoken word is the original seed it's the spoken word that expresses the thought of jehovah the message of the hour is the expressed thoughts of jehovah amen the thing has to be spoken so on the day of pentecost when the holy ghost fell and they come stumbling out there they thought those people were drunk but peter the bible says peter got up and lifted up his voice said these are not drunken as you suppose but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and joe and peter spoke and gave qualification to what was happening in that very moment and tied it to the scripture identified the manifestation as something that had already been written in the word amen remember when the eunuch was coming back from jerusalem on his way back and the holy ghost told philip to go join himself to that chariot and he was reading from the book of isaiah and philip said understand us thou what thou readest and he said how can i accept some man guide me is that right so the holy ghost sent his man philip to that unit because he had a hungry heart he was seeking the lord he was seeking the truth and god had a man right there for that hour to speak over that written word and it came to life to that eunuch right the bible says philip opened up his mouth amen spoken word shedding light on the written word that's why it's so important to hear the message that's why it's so important to hear good teaching and good preaching amen praise the lord so thank god for the truth amen in ephesians chapter 6 verse 19 brother paul was praying or telling the ephesians to to pray and and pray for me that utterance would be given to me that i might open up my mouth and make known the mysteries that's right that's how it's brought out spoken word amen you got to speak it the only way to make anybody conscious of anything is to speak it to them that's right you got to be able to speak and you got to be able to hear you got to have an open heart and open mind to be able to receive the word is that right amen to god that's right we want that holy ghost utterance and we want the ability to hear what the spirit is saying amen so praise god brothers and sisters we're living in a fantastic hour absolutely outstanding time when the whole mystery and the whole plan of redemption has been fully disclosed to the end-time bride as we were trying to illustrate yesterday i don't believe there's any puzzle pieces missing i just tell you the truth right now i believe the message is perfect i believe it's complete if there's anything else for the prophet to do amen right it's been done right right brother amen i believe the message is perfect i believe it's complete it just takes the holy ghost inspiration to see it and it's fullness ain't no puzzle piece is missing it's all been put together the picture's been put together you just have to gaze intently upon the unveiled one the one that's come unveiled amen revelations 10 7 introduced revelations 10 1. he's been unveiled the apocalypse is the unveiling amen you know what you look at is what you're going to reflect in your life the thing that's magnified the thing that's always on your mind what you're looking at right i've heard young kids say bless god i ain't never going to be like my mom and dad and they end up being just like them because that's all they're looking at huh what you study and what you gaze upon is what's reflected in your life and the bible says you need to look in the mirror of the word to be studying the revelation and the unveiled word amen because a life lived by the word would be the word expressed amen now you remember in the book of genesis whenever adam and eve fell god put four cherubims around the tree of life brother branch said it was the four cherubims you know the lion the ox the man the eagle he said there's only four ways you can go so all four approaches to the tree was blocked off right amen well whenever that the lord showed moses how to build the temple and whenever they put the veil between the most holy and the holy place they did a work of weaving into the veil the cherubims the bible says they put the cherubims in there right so when jesus died on the cross and the temple veil was rent from top to bottom the veils was removed so the cherubims was moved out of the way so you can have access amen by faith uh we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have access into this grace is that right so brother brown says there was a time when the cherubims was blocking man from the tree of life but in the book of revelations they're trying to drive man to the tree of life amen and we realize now in the opening of the seven seals that the churches through the ages was anointed with these cherubims and the early church age is anointed with the character of a lion the holy spirit was anointing the people the boldness praise god they beat the apostle paul drug him out there in the road and leave him dead he got right back up and went in there and preached some more that's pretty bold if you drug me out here stop me in the parking lot i'd probably get in my car and go home but back then there was anointed with the lion the boldness of a lion they were bold they had to be bold and then the age went on you know you come to the dark edge it was anointed with that oxen on him that's sacrificial servitude in spite of all the persecution it just kept right on strong as an ox animal sacrifice is that right and in the finally the age came the trueness of a man and the the founding fathers of the united states forged the constitution there's shrewd people right it was under that anointing right finally it comes to our day and people wonder what we got what we get what we get it we can't help it because we're anointed we're anointed to see what we see it's a prophetic anointing amen the whole word's been given is that right you notice the lion is an earth-bound creature the ox is earthbound right the man's earthbound but the ego ain't right the ego's a flying eagle anointed to fly they have a prophetic understanding amen that's why we see what we see that's right and that's why in that love that lov that's lion ox the visage of a man an eagle this banner over me is love amen praise god for that love god ministers for his saints in each and every age and anoints them according to what they need right amen we needed the prophetic anointing in this hour to be able to withstand that antichrist spirit amen to rise above all the influence of the antichrist praise god i'm so glad for that anointing today to see what we see and come up become a part of christ in this age in this hour praise the lord uh let's look at this quote here in identification the brothers want to bring that up let's see here can you identify yourself with peter on the day of pentecost can you identify yourself there in acts 2 where the people say today the holy ghost was only given to the 12 apostles can you identify yourself with peter when he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children to them that's far off even as many as the lord god shall call this same holy ghost do you identify yourself there with him on that day i stand with you peter yes sir upon your fundamental teachings of the scripture i stand there i want my life to reflect the scripture just like yours did there when 3000 was pricked in their hearts when they seen the boldness of them amen a few days after that they knowed they had been with jesus they had the word and they know the word was living right through them and they was afraid to tamper with that word of god because there was representatives of that word with such a life that god would reflect himself right through amen told a man silver and gold have i none i don't have big buildings and great big things such as i have i will give you in the name of jesus christ stand upon your feet such as i have amen now identification in the scripture is a tremendous revelation in these last days to be able to find our place in our position in christ the word amen now you might remember early in brother branham's ministry he was ordained as a missionary baptist and uh sometimes he would tell about some of the minister brothers tell them about what would happen to him and they'd say no brother branham that's of the devil falling into trances and seeing visions and everything like this and brother branham would cry and say oh brother mckinney pray with me i don't want to be a devil but the ministry was telling him that and getting brother random all tore up so he's in the yard one day and he fell into a trance and he's staggering over there in the front porch and he sits down sister amita brings him a glass of water and he says me to honey i'm going into them woods and i'm not coming out until god takes this thing away from me because the ministry was telling him that it was of the devil he was all tore up so he goes into the woods there in his trapping cabin and he's been praying all night brother brahman says two o'clock came three o'clock came seeking the lord all night long and finally that light coming to the room and that angel came barefooted walking in the room he says do not fear i come from the presence of almighty god and what did that angel do for brother branham when you watch that read that story that angel took brother random into the scriptures and showed him his life and the purpose that he was on earth for that's what that angel did brother brahm left that place a new man god sent an angel to show brother branham his identification in this word and brother branham is the angel that god sent to you to open up this word to show your identification in this word amen that's what this is all about the message is sent to us in these last days to show us our true identity in christ amen and this is where the authority comes from this is where you begin to understand your place in your position this is where you begin to come into a place where you can exercise true authority over the flesh over the devil and over the world because your place in christ has been revealed to you amen now you think about that brother branham was born april 6 1909 but all the bible had already been written 1900 years so brother branham's growing up he comes to a place in his life he hits this crisis he goes into the place and he starts seeking god in earnest and the lord sends him an angel opens the scripture to him and shows brother branham the ministry calls it bails above then and they're doing it today it's the same thing right so brother branham began to see himself in the scripture brother branham began to see the hour that he's living in reflected in the scripture amen so as brother solomon said there's nothing new under the sun the very hour that we live in has been reflected in this bible amen ahab was a king in israel brother brown said the history of israel is happening again right here in the united states israel had ahab israel had it jezebel israel had in elijah america's got the same thing ahab had three wars with syria and he was killed in the third one the united states has had three main wars is that right in between the second world war and the third world war elijah comes and you read that in first kings chapter 20 22 right in between the second syrian campaign and the third syrian campaign elijah comes right in between there exactly the way it's happened here in the united states is that right remember what president brother branham compared to ahab john f kennedy ahab was shot right in his chariot john f kennedy was shot right in his chariot it's a perfect reflection of the scripture so there truly is nothing new under the sun everything that we're living in right now has already been shown to us in the bible that's why you got to be in that word constantly to know where you're at and what's going on brother brown said i sure love good singing but the greatest thing that i have for pleasure is meditation in the word of god huh that's right all right amen you're supposed to come to a place in the lord where it is a pleasure to meditate in the word of god that's food for the soul amen you know when you're feeding on the word of god you're just feeding on the same substance that your soul was made of are we taught that our soul is an attribute of god a thought expressed right and we live by dead substance you have to eat food that comes from the ground and your body came from the ground well in order for your soul to live and be sustained you have to eat the same thing that your soul's made of if you're predestinated see the god your soul's made of the word of god so you have to feed on the word of god to be sustained amen that's where you know do you understand who who's who and what's what how to eat what they feed on shows their character that's right you feed on the things of the world you're of the world glory feed on the things from heaven you're of heaven that's right that's pretty straight praise god for the truth amen i had that strain in my family i think it comes from my mom's side i just tell the truth if it makes grandma mad and just have to tell it and so i don't do it just to be spiteful it's just a habit it just comes out praise the lord we're going to look at something today that floored me in one of our last quotes but let's go ahead to uh that next quote identification there around paragraph two let's start at 238 moses had to stoop from a throne to take the word of god he forsook a throne that's right he was heir to a throne and he forsook the pleasures of being pharaoh for he esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt amen you say well i tell you the woman will all laugh at me the men will think i don't care what they think that's right paul stooped moses stooped from a throne i got a line of them wrote down here to take three pages but let me tell you something help you right quick jesus stooped from heaven thank god he did to reflect himself in the form of sinful flesh and who are you and who or i to make make a way for us to reflect god jesus christ stooped from heaven to make a way for us to reflect god he opened up a way divine communication by inspiration right see a way for us to reflect god to make a way to reflect himself in us by sanctifying us to his word glory to god who praised god i like it rubbing elbows with people that think about the word talk about the word amen for this word says that when he did so so that we could reflect his word first john 14 12 he said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also why it was christ reflect a little while in the world won't see me no more yet you'll see me for i personal pronoun be with you even in you oh my it's christ in the people causing them to live by the scriptures for this day christ in flesh amen even in you see all the end of the world oh if any will follow me let him deny himself let him deny his man-made creed pick up his bible and follow me that's right yes sir then you are identified somewhere in scripture no doubt i'll have to close you're identified somewhere in the scripture you know that each one of us were identified amen amen amen the unveiling of god that next quote this is this is a good word brothers sisters recognizing realizing having the holy ghost bearing record to you of your position in christ is connected to rapturing faith amen the revelation of this hour is that you're at the end time right and you're right at the time god's going to close the door on the gentiles and go back to israel that's the time you're living in but at that time he brings a bride to such perfection in christ that jesus has the oversight the preeminence and the leading in her that he's able to change him in atoms and catch them away in genesis 49 10 we read last night when shiloh comes unto him will the gathering of the people be there's going to be a gathering yet but it's a resurrection right and a translation and we'll be gathered together to meet him in the air is that right brother braham taught us that when the resurrection sets in we all get together first brother it says watch the wisdom of the lord he lets us get together first so we see you know who's who and what's what and then when we ascend up to meet the lord in the air we're not looking at each other we're not looking to our side we're looking at jesus because brother brandon said it'll be a perfect worship that's right the bible says the gathering will be unto him that's the gathering we want amen onto jesus amen the holy ghost takes us there we're gathered together in these small amateur ways to gather unto christ we come together today in his name observe his word and his revelation for this hour but this is just a reflection of a greater gathering an hour that we're living for amen that's the gathering we want then we want to make ready for amen now brother braham says we're inside of christ now as then all true believers see him the word of promise of this day openly manifested the word of promise this day openly manifested that's a big word if you can get it see all true believers that's in the word see god openly gloria excuse me praise be to god my prayer my precious brothers sisters is the holy ghost the sweet holy spirit of god's anointing and so come upon each and every one of our lives that the word will open to us in such a way that we'll begin to see our true identification in the word amen to see exactly who we are in christ and live in that spot we can't make ourselves that has to be his spirit that does it but if his spirit is doing it recognize it amen profess it speak it amen jesus did brother branham did he put it a lot of times an allegorian story for him but you know he's talking about it is that right when he's saying abraham a-b-r-h-a-m graham six letters he never does mention bran him seven letters but you know your thought went there trying to lead you right up to it so you don't have to say it right amen jesus did those kinds of things say things without saying them huh that's right that's how that's how you hide you know you know what i'm trying to say that's that's where the lovers live over there you know what i'm saying that unspoken language that roundabout kind of language huh jesus has a way of communicating things to people amen amen so brother brandon reflected that wisdom of the lord and he taught the word and that's with the problem with so many people they have these quotes fighting quotes but the holy ghost is going to make it run in all continuity that's the way it is you can't file the letter of the bible the scriptures paul said the the letter kills lets the spirit give his life well you know you've seen the letter this message killed a bunch of people huh brothers drawing swords on brothers and fighting they all got their quotes for everything they believe instead of working for continuity they just gonna pitch a tent and camp on their little doctrine instead of seeing the whole picture come together brother brandon says you can't use just one scripture to prove anything it must lay in the continuity of the whole bible amen that's the way it is with the message from 47-65 and that's why we're so blessed to have it on a computer that you can search it out praise god i don't mean to get all preachy but i had a pastor in st louis and a dear saint of god i love him with all my heart and i still think about him and honor him today but he had an idea that just wasn't exactly right he believed that that the joshua ministry was one man coming to lead the bride well whenever i got to hold the table and start studying the messages for myself i found out my dear old pastor had it wrong that's the wrong idea ain't a one-man ministry no more it's a body ministry amen that one man ministry ceased when god took his profit home brother branham introduced the fullness of the word and it's christ incarnated himself in his endtime bride that's what it is everybody sees revelations 10 1-7 but they don't want to see 8-11 huh there's a word-born bride a word walking in shoe leather they might be few and far between but it's a reality she's here the bride coming of christ everything like this but the joshua ministry my dear pastor i learned an awful lot from him but he didn't have the uh the table back then this was years ago before the table ever came out but uh i'm just saying this as an example how people can just take certain parts of the message because you got to be careful you have to consider everything brother brahms said about a certain subject so that's why it takes time to just kind of settle down and be focused and careful and and thank god for good pastor brothers and elders in this word that really sit down and situate things and rightly divide the word amen we can't add to it or take away from it but it must be rightly divided amen praise god i appreciate that but thank god for the word today amen i thank god for the way that the lord has opened up these scriptures and let us see our true identification so let us see who we are amen now there's so many great things that god has done to let us see this kind of reflection this hour that we live in brother branham took things like for example in desperation he took a passage from jeremiah chapter 29 where god was telling him that even though you're going to go underway captivity for 70 years i'm going to bring you back into this land and then at the end of the sentence brother branham says see back to pentecost it doesn't say that but that's what i mean to the church right so brother brown was using that passage in jeremiah to show that just like israel was carried away into captivity the church was carried away into mystery babylon for seven church ages 70 decades or seven decades 70 years is seven decades and israel was in babylon for 70 years so the church was carried away into mystery babylon for seven church ages but after the seven church ages god brings them back into the land of their fathers this is what brother branham was pointing to so in the bible you take these old testament books and you make yourself familiar with what time the book was written respective to that 70-year captivity and so much opens up the book of ezra in the book of nehemiah is specifically for people like you read the book of nehemiah and you'll see yourself right there right the book of ezra brother brown preached the blessing prophet from ezra amen the book of nehemiah and the book of ezra are restoration books they're the time the history of israel when they come back into the land after the captivity and you and i have been brought back into the land of our apostolic fathers after the babylonian captivity so you know what's happened in the book of nehemiah nehemiah says the lord my god put it upon my heart to take a numbering of the people a reckoning of the people by genealogy so after the captivity there's a book a record brought out and opened up so the people can trace their genealogy amen that's right and there were people that were found in the book that's right but there were people that took on another name and there they they married often to other nations and took on their name so they were polluted from the registry those blasphemous names brother graham talked about right we're not surprised to be called by no other name but jesus christ amen glory so when you read those books of nehemiah ezra those things like that remember i'm just trying to give you a little key here a little tip make yourself familiar with which old testament book was written before the the captivity during the captivity like daniel and ezekiel and even jeremiah was prophesying while they was being taken away jeremiah daniel and ezekiel and then the books after the captivity right the bible's perfect absolutely perfect and our our precious heavenly father sent us this ministry in the last days to dovetail all scripture to see our true identification in the word amen see there you are identified somewhere in the scripture praise god now on the unveiling of god another quote here i mean the message is full of it's amazing brother wade whenever the lord opens your eyes about something it's just like the beginning of it it's like a floodgate then after a while that's all you can see every time i turn on the message and listen to something i see the same thing over and over again praise god that's the holy ghost in the unveiling of god it says as it is written written you are written epistles the bible said now what is an epistle it is a written word and you are the written see in other words you'd read it like this he said you are written epistles or you are the word that has been written made manifest nothing can be added to it you can't say i'm a written epistle and live some other kind of something but what this has already wrote brother brandon passes by see because nothing can be added or taken away right praise god brothers and sisters i just want to stand here today and encourage each and every one of you to keep searching keep digging diligently in this word until you find yourself in the word brother brandon said if you're in christ you're in this word amen now you heard the story about two brothers listening to a message and one comes out and says man i don't know if i like that tonight he called me a buzzard and the other brother said well sorry about that he called me an eagle right it depends on how you hear it right they meant him amen amen the next quote in for 114 mighty god unveiled in paragraph 114 moses veil he was the living word to the people amen see how many understands that i'm sure you do as message people i'm not afraid to say it william miriam branham his life in ministry is a fulfillment of scripture he was written he was written in this word amen you can take it to so many different places samuel lazar right brother branham's lazar who's rebecca yeah right you what was illegal's job to take rebecca to isaac right right amen that's right i've been taking isaac amen i've been escorted praise the lord let me take you into that secret place amen with the husband of my soul praise the lord amen it's amazing message we have today how awesome the scriptures have opened to us in these last days when our precious lord jesus after his resurrection was walking with the two to emmaus he expounded the scriptures to them amen and it's after brother branham operates that gift the sign of the messiah to prove that jesus christ is alive he's resurrected the sign of the resurrection the second pool right first pool healing second pull prophecy revealing the secrets of men's hearts that's the sign of the messiah then the third pulls the opening of the word after jesus resurrected he was fellowshipping with two disciples in the evening time amen and opened the word to him is that right so after jesus proved he was alive vindicated the prophet gave public proof that brother branham had the authority to interpret scripture amen and their interpretation just ain't some fandangled idea it's word upon word line upon line preset upon precept absolutely perfect amen so we see the opening of the word and how what it means to us the influence of the spoken word the influence of it upon our lives and the impact of it get into that place where it's influencing the way you think come under the headship of it coming to that place where it's inspiring you and moving in your life don't ignore it don't let your life get so covered about where you're not spending time in that secret place with the lord amen see and today the people that are veiled are the same thing they are written epistles read of all men not a new epistle but the epistle that's been written right now amen we don't need nothing new we just need what has been written but we need what has been written to be made manifest in our flesh amen because you know as well as i do that this very hour that we live in has already been recorded in scripture is that right and we can get specific there's specific things written in here that pertains to you and i amen that's been written made manifest not a new epistle but the epistle that's been written made manifest see it's those who believe the word and the promise of this day that god is pouring out a spirit upon all flesh excuse me and that is written epistles amen and when a person tries to carnally impersonate that it backfires your life shows what you are amen that's the truth praise god but that holy ghost in every age makes the person the true believer live the word for that age that's the work of the spirit you know what the false anointed ones are they have an anointing or the true holy ghost but they're off the word right so what's a true anointing a true anointing is when the holy ghost comes upon the seed of god and makes them live the word they can't help it they're just doing what they're of the nature that they're of it's reflected in their life because the spirit of god quickens the word to their heart amen because we're anointed with that ego anointing we can't help but see what we see hey don't blame me we're just anointed to it right that's right people of the world the globalist and the antichrist they're anointed that way amen we're anointed this way to walk in the steps of our father to follow the word the way he filed the word to have the same convictions he had amen to live by the word of god now the easter seal paragraph 237 brother brown makes it super plain in these quotes right here now precious brothers and sisters what we need is for god to make it so real to us individually to where you know what's written of you and i can't give it to you your church can't give it to you it's only by the holy ghost quickening it to you as our precious brother quoted last night when he got in the pulpit yesterday and the holy ghost is the only revealer of the word huh now people like to think they can just join church and by mere association be okay it don't work that way you have to have personal identification with jesus amen so jesus remember our scripture in ephesians hath quickened us together and seated us in heavenly places in christ jesus we're quick into this the spirit of god quickens us and orders our steps in the word amen brother braham said everything happens for a reason amen we wonder why we end up where we are and everything like this the holy ghost is ordering our steps see so jesus so full of this quickening power said if you can destroy this temple that took you 40 years you thought to build i'll raise it up in three days now this is where i love it right here why why could jesus say that right this is where we're living today because god opened up this word to us and this is where i'm connecting this authority to translate without death because it's written of you this is where you can rest ashore is that simple enough clear enough people wonder how rapturing faith comes today this is it right here because the person realizes it's written of them jesus realized that in his day brother branham realized it in his day and the pride realizes in her day it's written of her amen the holy ghost moved on brother brown said pick up your pen and write here's the secret of it the word is in the bride amen he shows her his word she receives it she never doubts it right and she being the wife to the husband she knows what he wants done with the word amen amen praise god that's continuity that's that's being connected amen praise god i remember one time i was working in the backyard all day and man it was on my heart to have chili for supper man i wish i had me a big old pot of chili i walked in the back door and danielle said honey i think we're going to have chili tonight i said praise god you're in the right spirit sister huh she's following headship amen that's right that's the way it is amen huh that's awesome ain't it that's the way it is between the wife and the husband that's the kind of fellowship and the unity and the agreement christ has with his bride amen i love that the bride of jesus christ just can't help but she agrees with the husband amen i agree with my husband christ the word there's just something about it i can't help it whenever i hear the voice i say amen whether or not i can understand it or not i say amen because there's something to it but you find out as you stay with it the lord is always going to bring you to the understanding amen it's okay i guess you know you say to the youngins you know you don't have to understand it you just have to believe it and that's true that's true to a certain extent but brother braham said a true ego will understand the message because it's the voice of the bridegroom amen but why why could jesus say that huh how in the world could people in this last day ever declare that they're going to be changing in atoms huh you were singing it yesterday to body change where's all that come from right out of the scripture it's in the bible glory the revelation is and it's so it's so amazing to me my brothers that there's people that don't even see that the rapture is scriptural right huh all right but it's it's it's it's a mystery that's been hidden but it's a it's a mystery that's been revealed to the bride brother brown said the rapture is a revelation to the bride amen it sure is that's true now i don't spiritualize everything i believe in a literal body change that's right amen but there is a revelation that catches you up into heavenly atmosphere pending the body change and that's one of the things that lets you know that you're going to change into atoms because you're already there in the power of the spirit quickened seated in heavenly places in christ jesus and the lord jesus christ is imparting these things to the members of his body why could jesus say that right that's probably where i should have started that's a good question i appreciate the way brother brown preaches things why could jesus say this the reason why he's asking a question is because he's trying to set you up to think about why jesus can make such a declaration right because he knew amen i want want to ask you why could jesus say a thing like that he knew that he was amen right now this is where going to church christian fellowship standing in the message is so important because you're living in a time where god has done something that he's never done in no other church age he's letting the end time people know point of fact what's written of them luther couldn't know it like this he knew a great deal of things he knew enough to to bring about a reformation man it always astounds me that little message of justification how it shook the world brought a reformation if that much truth or god's word could do that then what can all this truth do now huh that antichrist don't stand a chance against this anointed bride brother brown said she will not spoil her skirts glory this word has got everything it needs to keep the end time bride i believe that with all my heart take the world but give me jesus give me that revealed word give me that word made manifest in these last days show me the identification of the manifestation of christ in this hour open up that word speak it right huh isaiah said if they speak not according to this word there's no light in them right is that right i want to i want everybody that claims to believe this message to be able to truly and clearly by revelation of the holy ghost identify what scripture is being applied to this hour you're supposed to have this consciousness in this reality in this time you're supposed to know unknowing has been given to us let's go to first corinthians let's read something that just comes upon my heart right now first corinthians chapter two a knowing praise god brother my brothers and sisters the lord jesus has done away with denominational guesswork i ain't guessing on nothing we don't guess we're saved we don't guess we're healed we know we are we don't get i guess i'm born again you better get something better than that you better know you've passed from death unto life but what the apostle paul says in first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 6. how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect and that capstone right there right when that which is perfect just come that which is in part is done away amen i believe we've got a perfect word today amen yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nothing but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery amen but we speak spoken word the mystery of god because the mystery of god's hid in the written word but we speak it and it's revealed the spoken word unlocks the mystery that's contained in the scripture that's right amen that's why the message is so important amen amen and you come into that place and align yourself and line your soul spirit and body with that revealed word you're brought into speaking conditions yourself the apostles on the day of pentecost was brought into speaking conditions i believe with all my heart this end time bride is in speaking conditions she's the final voice to the final age under her messenger amen but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom it was hid which god ordained before the world unto our oh amen god hid it on purpose god hid it for us for our glory right now amen god hid things in this word for you to make discoveries i'm just going to preach it to you honey you yourself you come to church brother gets inspired you hear things and you pick things up but you and your personal private life god wants to deal with you you get in your prayer closet you open up that word and let the holy spirit open things up to you personally here's how it'll happen many times you'll be in your life doing whatever it is you do in your home riding in your car listening reading meditating on the lord and something will come to you something to open up to you right you hold that in your heart then you like an obedient child go on to church when the church door is open you come in you sit down the holy ghost starts moving the song service comes to an end prayer service is given then the minister comes to the platform and i'll be if the holy ghost don't cause them to speak exactly what you've been meditating on huh that's continuity that's how the lord speaks that's why you got to be in your own personal private life seeking the lord because god will speak and that's how you know it's god listen don't take this for granted if you're sitting at your house and you're reading jeremiah chapter 10 and something comes out of that passage and you're meditating on that and you're like well and then you go to church and the preacher takes his text from jeremiah chapter 10 don't say that's a coincidence that's not a coincidence come on be more spiritual than that there's a reason for everything that's why you should be paying attention pay attention to a service from beginning to end there is a reason certain songs are said there's a reason why the the brothers pray the way they pray there's a reason why the texts are read the ministry is speaking the way it is there's a reason for it all week long you should be being prepared by the holy spirit for the next service to be able to glean and receive what god's saying that's how you get built up that's how you get strengthened right huh that's right amen you're not going to get it watching oprah winfrey you're not going to get it reading worldly magazines a sports illustrated or whatever else holy ghost inspiration don't flow through those things huh everybody needs a little distraction but don't be so distracted you ain't paying attention to what the spirit says huh i've got a little recreation i go the shooting range and everything carry on but praise god i've got to get in my prayer closet find out what the spirit of god's speaking amen that's the way it is that's how it is in a cr like christian's life anyway right that's right the holy ghost speaking constantly the holy spirit is always speaking and the holy spirit is always willing to teach reveal open up the word and communicate things to you amen praise god now in our passage here in verse 8 which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man except the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god so when a person has the spirit of god in their life they're going to know something right because it's the spirit of god that knows all things amen now we have received not the spirit of the world verse 12 but the spirit which is of god that we might what people with the holy ghost know what the spirit of god is quickening in this hour isn't it the evidence of the holy ghost huh that's right people with the holy ghost know amen brother brown said make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that's right the holy ghost feeds on the that's right that's right praise god that's the truth i enjoyed that gloria praise the lord but why could jesus say that back to our quote brothers and sisters you understand the point that i'm trying to make quite simply what has happened my friends is that god has so opened up this word so sent the quickening power down revelations chapter 10 the angel of the lord come down the rainbow was around his head that's our king that quickening power was loosed at the opening of the seals that quickening power is coming to the bride to show her her place brother branham says in the seals when jesus comes off the seat and takes the book he opens the seals and he calls for his bride to take her place and her position at his side that's right and that's why you have this reflection in the book of esther she went to the king's throne to come to the king's throne right and the king put forth his scepter and she touched it right and that scepter is an emblem of his dominion his rule amen so esther came to a place a position and began to exercise something as if it was the king himself right praise god knowing your place in your position right knowing what's written of you it has to become so personal to you the message has to become personal the opening of the word has to become something that's influencing you personally the opening of the seven seals has to have a personal effect on your life that's preaching but that's the way it is now uh why why could jesus say that i want to ask you why could jesus say a thing like that he knew that he was amen i wish i could make that stick he knew who he was he knew that every word god had wrote in there of him he had fulfilled it he knew he was the one david spoke of glory uh-oh do you know you're the ones the bible speaks of right that's where rapture and faith comes from that's what i'm telling you today that's how the people know they're going because it becomes a revelation it's written of them amen amen that's it right there praise god that's where i'm trying to live live in that understanding that place where the spirit of god quickens that word to let me know it's written of me amen see now let's go on here paragraph uh do you know you're the ones the bible speaks of congress says amen do you know your position is in christ is that right now my precious brothers and sisters we know in the last 2000 years our precious lord jesus has been calling his elected bride out from the world system into himself right you say well praise god i'm in christ and that's absolutely incredible and important right but what i'm trying to just share with you is that we have it specifically we know what part of christ we're in amen amen we know that we're not a foot age we know where they're not a handy we're not even a mouth age the pentecostals are speaking in tongues and we're not even in the eye age no more brother branham was the seer we've passed that into the mind of christ the end time bride is clothed with the intelligence of the husband the mind of christ that's how she knows what he wants done with the word because she has the mind of the husband amen see do you know your position is in christ but what part of christ is our position in right so we know it as an age we know it as an overall church but also as individuals some we were made to know right some of us are deacons some of us are pastors evangelists some of us are are housewives but that's our position in christ amen being a housewife can be just as important as anything else that's right if you're in christ being a housewife right if you're just a precious brother in the church and you have to be a mechanic as long as you're in christ you're a mechanic in christ amen it's important there's a there's a position and a place for every member in the body and jesus said the least is greater amen so if you're in christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like everyday living to you oh my meditating the word constantly my friends you need it more now than any other hour all kinds of deceiving spirits just chewing people up and spitting them out they don't even know how vindicated this message is and they're turning from it left and right amen see brother and says why sure it's yours he said this bible is yours it's a gift from god amen that's right why sure it's yours you're an eagle that's your food amen paragraph 240. he said uh he knew that by the power of god he would do it because it was prophesied he would do it that's the reason he wasn't scared to say destroy this temple that's the reason he wasn't scared to say because he knew it was written of him that's right so let's just relax a man and think about this okay the lord jesus has children that come to this same knowing that he had right brother branham is an example of this but brother branham represents the overall bride enoch does too enact represents the translated bunch right so god will take one man let him represent a people he'll do to that one man what he's going to do to a people abraham and sarah turn back young again there's your representation right there amen so our precious brother branham was conscious of what was written of him so the end time bride is too the individuals come to that knowing amen and this is where rapturing faith comes from okay so he knew by the power of god he would do it because it was prophesied he would do it amen amen that's the reason he wasn't scared to say destroy this temple i'll raise it up in three days because david said i'll not leave a soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption he knowed not one cell of his body would corrupt amen do you know there's no death for a christian that's right i i i've preached funerals of christians knowing in the holy ghost they wasn't dead right they just stepped right over into another dimension amen it's a it's amazing i carried my holy ghost grandma i was a pallbearer at my grandma's funeral and i know she lived this message the holy ghost was living it right through her amen she had the pictures in her house whenever i was growing up and uh my grandma followed the message out of her heart and i just knew whenever i was carrying her body to that hole in the ground i knew grandma was over there in glory praise god and it's different when you're at a funeral like that i cried because i couldn't have fellowship with my grandma but there was joy in the midst of it people think you're crazy when you when you got that going on but praise god i had something i've been to funerals where i felt more joy than sorrow absolutely because i know what they lived and i know how the word lived through them now i'm almost to the point of envy that's right because they're over there no aches and pains not sweating it out in the heat praise god brother abraham said over there there's no way to be sorrowful no way to have any regrets that's right praise god for the truth amen amen that's the reason he wasn't scared to say destroy this temple i'll raise it up in three days because david said i'll not leave a soul hell neither well i suffer my holy one to see corruption he knowed not one cell his body would corrupt because it was written specifically the specifics was he had to come out before three days so within three days he had to come out of the grave because it was written specifically like that now brother brahma mentions one time about scriptural barricade a scriptural barricade god will not change his word for nothing no body if you go to thessalonians first thessalonians chapter 4. i'll show you an example of a scriptural barricade you think a preacher would know where thessalonians is first thessalonians chapter 4 all right now the bible says in verse 16. for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout we know that's the message to do what gather the bride gather where in christ in shiloh in the mystery of the seventh seal to be quite frank with you this is the seventh seal the lord himself descended from heaven if you read verse 16 go to revelations chapter 10 it's the same thing it's not two different things it's the same thing i appreciate this church so much you can preach on the seventh seal and not get drove out of here praise god that's nice ain't it amen that's the seventh seal right there the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout out that's the message and the seven seal sermon brother brown said did anybody think of that them angels coming to bring me the message so it's a shout here revelations 10 it's thunders matthew 25 it's a midnight cry right right same thing gathering the bride amen and it's the seven thunders that literally turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers exactly so all right so the voice of the archangel brother branstad was the resurrection so the lord descends from heaven with a shout and we're right now ready waiting for the resurrection right and in the trump of god and that's our ascension to the throne amen right and the dead in christ shall rise when first amen so guess what you're not going to change until then that's a scriptural barricade that's the way god does things that part has to be met first before the rest can be met right so then it says in verse 17 which is our verse this is where it's written of you my friends then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together but they rise first even brother brown put it like this in different ways but they rise first and then we're changed that's right so that's scripture that's a barricade right so whenever that part of the scripture is made up and fulfilled there is nothing to stop the quickening power of the spirit to quicken that part of the word in our lives glory to god amen amen that's awesome i enjoyed that praise god that's the truth how many understands amen that's the way it is then we which are alive and remain praise the lord so god bless you today my precious brothers and sisters i appreciate all that the lord has done for us in these last days quickening this to us praise god and having this kind of fellowship is just absolutely wonderful to my heart amen living in the expectation of this part of the word that god is about to fulfill and bring to pass that tremendous victory in the love divine amen praise the lord i'm just so happy to to be a part of it in god's amazing grace in these last days precious brothers and sisters i just kind of feel led to go ahead and bring it to a close and and uh just love you so much and appreciate being able to share with you it's such a wonderful audience to share with praise god i don't know we're gonna have another service two o'clock all right praise the lord get to share again okay praise the lord all right amen god bless you the lord showed me a little something i'm sorry okay i'll pick it up in the next service and there's another quote i was going to share but i'll just wait so praise god for his love and his mercy amen i love the lord jesus don't you praise god our precious lord jesus is so wonderful he is perfect everything amen i'm so sorry for people i you know in these last days but you know the bible said there come a falling away it can be hurtful and disappointing but brother sisters nothing's going to stop the bride from staying with that word amen have an old song says touch not the message my father gave me my feet to guide my soul to feed lay no unfriendly hand upon her for that would leave me poor indeed touch not the message there is no other that tells of one who died to save that answers all my deepest questions and sheds the light beyond the grave amen i much prefer that you would love it as it came from god to me take nothing from it add nothing to it just as it is so let it be amen don't touch that message it's perfect amen it's a perfect message and that message is getting the bride ready and prepared to meet the lord jesus christ amen let's pray precious father thank you so much god for this time with your precious saints lord here and little georgia god i pray that your hand will be upon him in a mighty and special way in the hours and days and weeks and months ahead however long you tarry but lord help us to live god so faithfully and live god an expectation of your word being fulfilled help us to become so conscious of what you've already manifested what you're manifesting now and let us live in a worship and expectation of what you're about to fulfill because we know the word's moving it's moved down through every single age and it's come right up to this hour and lord we find ourselves involved we find ourselves associated we find ourselves as a part of the unfolding the manifesting and the calling oh god help us to walk worthy of the vocation god to be just in a perfect oneness and subject to you in every way lord forgive us where we fail you wash us bless our fellowship this afternoon god we love you may we glorify you honoring you and putting your word first always in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen love you brothers and sisters thank you so much for letting me share with you man god bless you amen god
