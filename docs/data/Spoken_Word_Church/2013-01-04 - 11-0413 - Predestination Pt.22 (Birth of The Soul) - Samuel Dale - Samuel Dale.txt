Saturday Saturday night especially cuz Friday night you can pretty well take care of it because you'll be all Friday but for the Saturday night time so just make sure uh you let us know okay and any other announcements I know I generally forget it but uh so if you like turning your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Ephesians we'll only read like verse 3 through 7 and to get a point but then we will go to a very familiar scripture with all of us which will be John 3 and so let's just look at that Ephesians 1 and John 3 father we thank you for an opportunity of being out tonight and we pray that you would just come among us and not be just an onlooker to record our lives but be a per very preeminent one in our hearts and lives and we thank you for your word that you have given unto us and we Praise Your Great Name we give you all honor glory and praise and we commit everything to you now and ask you to just have your will and have your way with each one of us forgive our sins because that's what we want to do is make sure we're always covered lead us in Jesus name amen we've been just using part of Ephesians you know kind of uh on each one and we will get into the Lord willing on Sunday into like the adoption and things of trying to cover it so uh verse three Ephesians 1 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now if you would turn to John 3 and it said very familiar with all of us you know the new birth scripture cuz that's what we'll be dealing with tonight there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a re ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him to him Rabbi we know and look at the great honor that you know was given is we know thou art a teacher come from God now brother random says on Church AG book 141 that Jesus said I'm not the teacher I'm the sacrifice all right so now my point is we read the Bible and it's put in the Bible enough to what we need right but it's not necessarily everything that went on in the conversation right you understand so then when when Nicodemus you know come to Jesus they probably had greetings they had all kind of things that took place you know and and you know a discussion but then right in the middle of it you know Nicodemus says now now Rabbi we know that th are a teacher come from God all right now watch for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him so he wasn't just talking about a teacher that's right you understand he wasn't just meaning you're a teacher he was saying we know you got to be right right because God don't back up error all right so we know you're right you know and and and and all and we know that God is with you okay then Jesus answered and said unto him now watch the two parts of what I want you to get Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be borned again he cannot see understand see the kingdom of God all right Nicodemus sayth unto him how can a man be born when he is old see totally natural because without the new birth you cannot comprehend the scriptures right no matter if God is speaking personally to you you will not comprehend what he's saying all right you following me now can he enter a second time into his mother's W and be born now watch Jesus again verily Jesus answered verily verely I say unto thee except a man be born of water and a spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that's right it's possible that you can see the effects of the Kingdom as my point you can see what's taking place you can see uh signs and wonders healings Etc you can see that I don't mean you understand but you can naturally see it so Jesus put it into a stronger form you can't enter it you can't enter it so you got to be able to see it before you can enter it right see that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marv not that I say it unto thee you must be born again you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been on predestination and we see that from the story of predestination that God doesn't predetermine things apart from his forn knowledge and then in his forn knowledge then he would know how many people would be saved and how many people would not be saved by his for knowledge not not that he desired it now remember the prophet said he desired and the scripture says it you know he desired that everybody be saved all right so then it's not based upon the desire of God it's based upon the fact that he knew all right by for knowledge okay then he could predestinate all right some people to come to the New Birth and it did on the day of Pentecost but out of a world of how many million Etc was may be there on that day only 120 received the new birth right right all right now see there was only 120 predestinated them to come to the New Birth there was only 120 that uh would be able to hold on to the word all right as the scripture said they took the word and held it see the scripture says that Jesus was seen of over 500 see Brethren after his resurrection right but evidently there was 3 about 80 of them or something there that they didn't hold on right now they could see now that's the point I want you to get they could see the effects of the Kingdom they could see the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ y right they could handle him they could eat with him they could fellowship with him for a period of time but yet they never got to enter into the Kingdom right on the day now I'm not saying they didn't later that's between them and God but it did say they were Brethren and maybe that means they later came to it I you know that's all right we're not trying to judge anything We're just trying to lay down a situation for you to look at but see some reason they didn't count it right worthy or whatever to go to the upper room to wait so then when we get back to the message from Romans you'll see that uh you know predestination start starts in the New Birth amen all right and it'll come out to be the uh you know the adoption of situations but you know and and remember one thing I'll get to it later in the message cuz this is just a kind of a background so keep it in in your mind until we can get back to it Sunday as what I'm trying to bring so remember this is a background Point let see you and I were born kin folks to the devil right amen so so God had to adopt us into his family that's right you so then we start talking about it in your new birth you'll understand then see basically everybody talks about adoption what you hear is they want to go up the pyramid but you got to get in the pyramid before you can go up the pyramid so keep that now in your mind until Sunday and then we'll see how that it'll it'll start unfolding maybe a little more of of about the the doings all right but see there was only like I said 120 out of the whole world and out of the thousands of thousands that had heard the Lord Jesus Christ and brother randam gave it one time about what 116 to 1% or something I forgot it was just a very small minute number of people in the world that actually ever even seen Jesus or heard much of him but then you keep breaking that down no wonder it was only 120 you know in the upper room but now so follow the point now these people were predestinated to receive the new birth right because that would be the the point or the time and the word that would be unfolded unto them all right now so now we'll we'll drop back to what we're talking about why would Jesus tell the most learned man of the day Nicodemus was the teacher right he was the teacher of Israel amen you know he was T not sky and here he comes talking to the Lord Jesus putting all on the line of his life and job because he'd be ridiculed and everything else you know if people found him so he comes to him by night and seemingly it looks like that he starts bragging on the Lord Jesus you know right because we know that no man can do these things unless God be with him and immediately seemingly Jesus comes up with something that would be that was so contrary to what Nicodemus was right coming for cuz there's no record of what he came for you know he had heard of the Lord Jesus you know and all like that but it's not written down that he came for a reason or he came for this surely he had some reason but immediately the Lord Jesus says You must be born again and he was telling them then you cannot see or understand the kingdom y Nicodemus is looking at him Kingdom born again this man knows the Bible that's right right amen and he's trying within his mind to comprehend what the Lord Jesus is talking about see they believe they were the people of God right and they were until they turned the Lord Jesus down y right but they believe that they were the people of God they believe that the so in other words Nicodemus could be sitting there what if it was you that had never heard anything about it and and all like that and you you hear of a man doing great signs and wonders and you go sit down and and and you have in your mind that you're there for a reason right and seemingly the the man turns around to you and says just like he did to disciples you know they come up and said well these are gone he said well why don't you go too you know I mean that's just paraphrase in the language you know why don't you just go see right a lot of things in the Bible you know like the the little woman you know the the Gentile you know saying you know and Jesus said you dog so there's a lot of things sometimes seemingly hard to understand why it would be done that way but you got to remember one thing now you and I have different ways of approaching people right you know you may talk about one thing I may talk about another we may approach them this way we may approach them that way whatever but just remember now me and you we're carnal you know we we we may be led of the Lord to talk to somebody but maybe not letter of the Lord all to be said but just remember we're talking about almighty God right so there was no other or better way you say well it looked like he would have he would have said this and looked like he would have said that looked like he would said this you know to each one of the the Nicodemus or to the you know to the the Gentile woman you know or whatever or to the disciples why don't you go to Y it looked like maybe that he was being something where he just looked like he's running them off but now remember that's God right so don't question what he's saying to the people right well he could have said it a little different way well see that's your carnality well now he comes to Jesus but see our carnality would put him some other way but remember that was God's way and remember if it's God's way then there is no other way right and there's no better way right amen righten see we we comprehend in our mind try to figure out some better way right we approach somebody one way and that don't work we go to the another way we go to another way but God doesn't do that he just goes straight and says it and that's it it right so he says now Nicodemus you got in your mind something and maybe that was what he wanted to talk to him about right maybe he wanted to discuss with him the reason that he had heard him in in speeches that he in sermon you know that he had made that he was speaking of a kingdom surely Nicodemus wasn't blind you know to not knowing anything and he knew that he was speaking of a kingdom and he knew that he'd speak like that seemingly he must die to bring that Kingdom we see all of this is in Nicodemus his mind right and remember he's talking to almighty God that could know what was in his mind or thoughts all right but he says now but Nicodemus you got to be born again right you can go through all of the discourse about how that the wind bloweth and this goeth and that goeth and all up and down through there and all that's well and good but just get one point Jesus said except you'll be born again now here stands a man that thought he was born right mhm right now they knew as I've always said about it and believe it they knew about life and how you was born am and and Nicodemus wouldn't have had any trouble for the Lord Jesus to say Nicodemus you know are you a perfect man and he would have probably said well no right I'm not perfect but I've done the sacrifice I've done what God required for me to do and I stand under that see because he was a good man that's right now you're not dealing with somebody coming along you know thinks he's all this that and the other but I've always told you I believe that those Pharisees they laid on the fact that that circumcision yeah was the what set them aside and it did from the other nations of the world right see and and they believe that that circumcision was what would do away with any serpent seed existence man because it's you know it's odd that he would would give them the the the sign of circumcision knowing that what happened in the garden yeah he wouldn't eatting apples you know see he gives them the sign of circumcision and there laying heavily on it said we you chose us from Abraham you you know this is all in Nicodemus is mind and and yet Jesus seems to be just driving it even harder he said Nicodemus you can't under you can't understand what I'm talking about unless you're born again now that means born from above is the original translation I gave you some quotes from Brother random to show it it means born from above that's right amen all right now Nicodemus is said knew Jesus spoke of a kingdom and that Jesus spoke of a kingdom up in heaven he spoke of a father's Kingdom he spoke of a a coming day and there he's wondering he says you can't comprehend what I'm talking about unless you're born again right he turns and looks at him he says what good would it do me to go back and be born a second time I'm a smart man now you know he wouldn't have saying that you know how smart he was he said I'm sensible I understand what good would it do if you say I was born wrong the first time and I must be born from above what good would it do for me to go be born again go back my mother's wound and come again right you say I can't see I can't understand you and Jesus then he laid it down hard he said I say unto you Y unless you're born again you can't enter right to the kingdom I'm talking about Nicodemus is sitting blindly trying to figure out what's going on right y right you remember when somebody first started maybe talking to you about the the Lord you don't want how to do with it did you right we had a different reason than Nicodemus had Nicodemus were was a very religious man that's right but listen Nicodemus was like all mankind then and he says I don't understand you I just can't comprehend you right I'd like to know that was the reason I came was to try to get some understanding cuz I've heard so many things that you preach right and you spoke of a kingdom and you spoke of of of God up in heaven and you spoke of a a way that you know that we must get there they said this I just don't understand but see way that we would be we would be like the especially the Believers in the message that would say well well what do you mean I must be born again I believe the message right now isn't that the way people state it today I don't in other words let me state it the way they stated all I don't need a new birth I always was eternal now that's what you would call a worser deception than even the blindness of Nicodemus amen right right CU Nicodemus never laid anything on you know right all he would lay on it was this Natural Things of what would be right according to the scripture the circumcision was a point of setting aside they were a chosen people see right but the only way you can be in the kingdom of God is to be born from above amen you got to be born again amen it's not because you believe the message right it's not because that you you believe you know and you you say well well you know I believe everything that the Bible says I believe everything brother Brown says I wonder what he'd say today right I wonder what the Apostle Paul would say when he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed right you believe the prophet's message but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe because see we're sitting in a situation of I I I I tried to explain things and I know in the carnality hard it is hard to do uh you know a good Baptist would say all Nicodemus had to do is believe right right poor Nicodemus all he had to do is believe now here's a guy that all he ever done was believe right m i mean he believer her from the day he born because he set aside for the job live the life everything was perfect Jesus never said one thing about him right almighty God setting there never told him as I said the other day in the message prior to this that you know people say say well what must I do to be saved well you need to quit this you need to quit that you need to stop doing this you need to go here you need to go you need to believe the message you need to you remember the message we brought but see Mankind's never ask it that way they ask what must we do to be saved yeah all right now but you see living a good life is wonderful but you can do that without the B baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right that's right there's plenty of good people in this world that we're really in a realm make us ashamed of ourselves and a lot of them maybe not even claim to be Christians they're just good people right but have you and I been born from above right see Jesus was saying if I'm talking about a kingdom and I'm going to have a kingdom then you ought to know Nicodemus and I'd have to be king of it cuz I haven't come to introduce anybody else so now John introduced me but I haven't spent any time introducing anybody else cuz Jesus never done it right he spoke of his own self unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins he never spoke of another one to come that's right that's right he spoke of the Holy Ghost that would come and live in the hearts of the people to make them into the Kingdom right but he never spoke of another person to come right amen cuz the Holy Ghost is that selfs sameed person amen and just just listen to my point now so I gave you about three quotes there where brother Brown was talking about it on the oncoming storm and and that's 1960 then he has the eagle stir at her nest in 1960 and and then one on uh questions and God being misunderstood in 61 he said we're to seek those things which are above cuz we're to be born from above a natural birth to go back and come back again would not change us right we would come through the same situation no matter if you was aund went back to a baby you would come forth as a sinner right all right see then we must be born from where Jesus came from amen and he came from above right he said if my if you know in other words if if my king was of this world my subject would fight but instead of that he said Peter put up your sword turn around put the man's ear back on that Peter had cut off had no reason no fight no no doing all right now we know then if he's speaking of you must be born from above right all right then Nicodemus could understand one thing being born from below wouldn't help you cuz that's what messed us up being born from below right if we' been if you come into the world with eternal life Jesus Christ didn't have to die for you right because you'd have eternal life from the kingdom he was talking about right and I don't believe that well you just don't believe the prophet well I believe some of it I just put it that way we in the church right here one day and door used to be back here you know and I won't call his name but this old brother he was here going to preach and we were going to have communion so I come in carrying the cups you know and everything and he seen when I got out of my other car and started in the church he said brother down he said all believers in the message have one cup well see I had done checked all that out you know and went back and asked brother Mo what they done to Tabernacle and he was there and took communion and they had many cups and all things I didn't went through all of that so I wouldn't going to argue and scream at him and say this that or the other I prove quote here quote there quote you know what I said to him I just open the door and let him in and I said well we believe part of the message oh I just arguably and say I said We Believe hard in the message so you know you say well you don't believe all what brother R said bring you quotes let's see there's the difference in it BR the quotes the prophet has said and let's see well he said we were born with eternal life he said yeah if you have eternal life that's right if you're born again you got eternal life that's right that was what he's trying to show Nicodemus all right but now let's get on with it we must be then born from where Jesus was born from right exactly but we know that we were all born here in this natural nature you know of ways and Kingdom and born in Satan's domain right looking at the kingdoms to me I got to thinking about this is just kind of meditating a little you know China's got a kingdom America's got a kingdom Russia's got a kingdom right huh what I mean by that is what Prophet said he said if you go to China they got a nature about him he said you go to this country you go to that country he said you come to America he said we've got a as brother Claud said the other day we've got a life and joking nature about America right right man we're whistling as the little boy was going through the graveyard kind of make out like that we're not afraid which that's the reason we're whistling but you know that's still we've got our nature right about us because a nature then will begin to deal deal with what we're trying to talk about see if we were born into the wrong Kingdom which was born into the kingdom of Satan then we can see easily why the Book of Ruth was written everybody knows the story there in the Book of Ruth right the Book of Ruth was written to show us the things you know of how that uh the way God would deal and what would take place and in the Book of Ruth there was born you know one was more kin folks to Naomi than Boaz was right there was a closer K than Boaz amen now Boaz then he wants he knows he got to get Naomi never how you pronounce her name there I but said you know to but to the point he he was really interested in Ruth right y well to me now that's what brings the whole thing to pass because that's the way I look at the Book of Ruth I love it see then Boaz he's smart enough to know that when he says to the Kinsman you know he said redeem your right he said I'll redeem it y read the book of Ruth he said I'll redeem now Boaz he's got to be smart enough to figure out something then so what does he say he said okay now you get Naomi but said Just remember now if you get Naomi Naomi's done too old so we're we're not thinking about having any more kids through you and Naomi but said the law requires that you take Ruth right and that you bear a child un through Ruth and that child will be put back as being the lineage from her husband you remember her husband was dead right instead it being the lineage and and that way the name won't diminish off the Earth and uh so being a Jew now this is a natural story see it's got to be a natural story cuz Jew didn't want to do with the Gentile see he was willing to take Naomi right and there was property involved and there was all the things that he would get you know and everything but when Bo said but you got to take Ruth he said she's a gentile and I'm not bringing a gentile into my house and having babies by her and let the first one go back to her husband a gentile you know maybe a Jew or whatever the name but a gentile would be in in enlisted all right so the Book of Ruth is a wonderful thing it shows us and I gave you a quote from kinsman redeemer I just wish you'd read that whole message number four on your notes cuz it shows us that we had one more kin to us that's right cuz in the story there more as was typing Christ Ruth the bride and this guy that was had the right to redeem was Satan the devil see you and I were born kin folks of the devil whether you like it or not but I don't see why you wouldn't like it why you going to talk about redeem take out all these words out of the prophet's message you know ex them out of the Bible of you must be born again and and you must be redeemed and and all these things and if you're lost and and and all of this and if you have to have a kinsman redeemer why don't you ex all them out of your Bible and out of the prophet's message if you're going to S oh he always was eternal y That's right go ahead but I would just exal them things out of my Bible I rip them out and and I'll heck you what a man told me one time he said you know them them gifts over in 1 Corinthians 13 said they need to be just taken out of the Bible just ripped out I said hand me your Bible I was grein he knew better to hand me that Bible I'd give him $500 bought another Bible if it had took it but I was going to rip her out because that's what he said you order to be taken out I'm just going to rip it out I was being mean I was just grinning and I knew he wasn't going to do it so he wouldn't let me have his Bible all right but now listen he never said no more about the gifts will be taken out either but anyhow now listen the prophet of God says that you first belonged to Satan our natural birth because of the fall in the garden now we dealt with Adam and Eve but then we move over now to Cain and Abel the the first two children sure everybody would agree that Cain was lost but they want to make some kind of a lineage thing out of Abel well if it did I'm sorry your lineage ended because Abel got killed before he had the children so you got a problem with your lineage doctrines see all right but you see everybody then borned you know into the world except Adam and Eve we would all be born in Satan's domain right right belonging to the devil yeah whether you like it or not the devil was your husband he was your Redeemer you belong to it we all did right no no I I was always a child of God well all right go ahead yeah I'm just still oldfashioned enough to believe in Redemption you know and believe you must be born again that's right now see then if we belong to him the prophet said who Satan he was the one in in the Book of Ruth he had the right to redeem but he didn't do it brother R says it you know the statements he made he said Satan can't cast out Satan he said Satan can't become a redeemer he said because it you know where would you redeem you to that's right he is from hell where would he take you take you with you no he ain't redeeming you you just belong to it that's right so you don't have to do anything to go to hell right except deny Jesus Christ right right because that's automatic it's not something that he's going to redeem you it didn't cost the devil a thing he didn't pay no price to get you and me we wound up belonging to it right right and the guy guy you look at in the mirror every day is the devil just looking back at you because you know what I'm going to say you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul you're not saved there's plenty of people that are Christian saved in body form that don't go out and do cuz they keep theirselves from doing things there's plenty of people then are in the anointed Realms of of that and that's the biggest portion of Christianity is the reals of what is called the anointed ones and and they go to church and do more than you and I serve God more than you and I ever even think about it y but yet they're not born again see Satan was our King y that's right you know it's kind of odd I watch things you know I'm sorry I I'm not like what people you know I don't watch things like other people seemingly do I don't mean that way cuz other people look around and they'll watch brother colie if they see him do something wrong yep yep yep yep yep yep they got their eyes on him you know they're looking at people that way I don't look at people that way right I look at people as people right and give them an opportunity but I tell you one thing I do look at I look to see what you do about the word and see how you'll handle the work see I thought that was a way we to was to know the spirits right whether they be of God or not you know the old Pentecostal way look them in the eye you know oh I'm Discerning your spirit no you don't discern Spirits by that you discern it by the word cuz that can be fooled and messed up but see I keep my eyes upon what you and I and are thinking about the word y that's right that's the part I watch okay see because I know that we're all born kin folks to the devil that's right and that the new birth doesn't take place in your body right that's where we go on to into the forms of one day that the adoption has to come to the basis of the Redemption of this body all right page 49 future home brother said Soul's redeemed said the body's waiting Redemption yeah that's right now so you're not born again in your spirit because that Spirit won't work and I've explained it to you how that brother Bram you watch him up until 62 on the greatest battle ever fought and you'll find him up through there not all the time because he was a prophet and God was speaking to him but basically he was preaching what Body Soul Spirit right but after this the the greatest battle ever fought from there on you'll find him saying what Body Spirit Soul right all right to me now it was done to where people can come up with the fact I get a New Soul the Bible doesn't say that Bible says you get a new spirit well the word soul and Spirits interchangeable up and down no that's all right all those are well and good but I hope by now you're beginning to see that brother Dale believes that a soul is real amen that it's a real you that's the part I'm trying to deal with that's right I Don't Preach to bodies I Don't Preach the spirits cuz you can sit right there and H Glory hallelujah amen and denying every word I'm saying that's right and everybody in the building thinks you're right there with me right right but I hope you get to point that I'm trying my best to make the soul the real you right right it's real it's not just a a a thought it's not just a a wind something blowing around in some spiritual being that's somewhere in some other category or fitting in the inco our compartment in your heart yeah it's the thing that lives on whether you're Christian or or lost it's the thing that lives on after death it's the thing that will have to come to judgment to be judged right that's right it's the real you who does it look like you y yeah would that be something me wind up one of these days and get all this change that everybody talks about and me look like Brother Ray and then him having to look like me that's going to take a whole lot of stretching shrinking right right he no I believe Brother Ray is going to be the same height Etc that he is and I will be too right cuz I don't believe in getting a new body right I like what uh brother who was it listen to Brother Richard the other day maybe brother CLA one of the two just said recently maybe brother Claud was talking about it that uh job he said in this he said though you skin worm destroy this body he said yet in this body I'll see God this flesh in my flesh see he didn't believe in getting a new one absolutely Jesus come up with nail prins and his he believe getting a new one but see that ain't going to change anybody that thinks that's right right amen you know why cuz they can't see right amen amen that's right you get it they can't understand n that's right they're just like Nicodemus they can't understand so thereby they can't enter now see we understand at least I'm trying to get us to understand that we were born in Satan's domain right that's right amen this doesn't belong to God now he paid the price yeah sure all right but he hadn't claimed yet right Satan's still The Prince and power of the IR he's still the controller of the world right sure we know God's in control we understand yeah but we know who the devil is too but see Jesus said you must be born from where I am he said he double stated it you know what the prophet said anytime the Bible double States itself you know for sure it means pay close attention it says verily verily I say unto thee you pay close attention something fixing to be said that verily is not not enough verly verly right step it right listen that's the reason he's doing that cuz he doesn't repeat his but let's go back now look at something CU Jesus said and I know what this is about but you better believe it's all about everything I know what Jesus said in the scripture he said but from the beginning it wasn't so I know that's talking about marriage and divorce okay but I know it's talking about me and you amen see from the beginning it wasn't so right we wern't planned to come this way no that's right but God knew by predestination for knowledge that we would come this way amen but he didn't make us come this way we had to make a choice amen and in doing it see then he would see what it would take place and he would see that he would have to come but he couldn't send an Angel that's right he couldn't send a son that's right he had to come himself Amen in the form of the man our form our being are like us right to be a Kinsman to take away the perversion all right now so he predestinated of people to come to the new birth right that's been all the way down to there that's right amen all right ever born again believer because what he done he knew that if he put us the prophet said on free moral agency and I know a lot of people don't believe that you know but that's all right I'd still rather have whosoever will cuz the prophet said I'd rather say that than say William Brandon right cuz there might be some more of them but see but he permitted us to come the way that would make us into a fallen condition and then when that would come down through look at number five on your notes and North it not 1965 he said that spirit is permitted of God not given now hold on a little bit what's he saying are you reading it he said permitted of God not given now what's he saying all life comes from God right right so it's permitted why would you say not given because it would not be the plan of God right it wasn't the plan of God for you and I to come the way we come his plan was for us to come the correct way right everything was there but he knew that that would never take place that way so he permitted a life but he didn't give it in a fallen estate now you understand why did I hammer it so hard that there's no way God can create anything sinful that's right he cannot create anything wrong but he can create things perfect right he created a perfect world we have turned it into a sinful condition righten he didn't I didn't say Eternal there's a lot of difference between perfect and eternal right amen our bodies come from Mom and Daddy as perfect as can be made that's right for the time and the day and the elements May we live in but it's still perfect right our spirit is permitted of God not given sinful right but permitted to come into being right man perfect cuz how can he create it imperfect amen if he created it imperfect you he can't blame you for being wrong right that's plain language just take it what you want to so your soul when it was created was created perfect not Eternal a lot of difference in the word but perfect cuz how could it be anything and I'm talking about ever Soul right I believe that Abel needed Redemption just as much as Cain did cuz Cain was a living Soul right yep now don't get it tied up back there any it remember remember the Beast had no soul right that's right now that's what your Prophet said so don't get it tied up in there and think it's I'm saying something wrong the Beast had no soul right that's right cuz he was an animal and an animal doesn't have a soul right but Cain was just as much a human being as AEL was no matter who the daddy and or whatever that's what we want to do get into some lineage if I could find my lineage and run it back to to Adam I could believe I saved well you ain't going to get no further in the ark anyway right you sure would mess up there and why would you want to go with that kind of a line that's right like brother CLA was talking about those signs and everything there the Zodiac and all I really enjoyed it cuz see I believe that you you might be born under a three four Aries or Leo the line or whatever you do it and then you'll say I can't hit it I born this way I guess I just born to be mean what people don't realize is you can take that zodiac and I can take it and I can pass it out right here in this building and 90% of you would agree with what I pass out as being you and I'd copi it out of some dictionary somewhere it had nothing to do with anything what you're talking about but see that's where I believe when you're born again I believe all born again Believers are born under the same side right amen you say is it Aries I ain't worried about it's Heavenly right amen that's a sign I want to be under as a Heavenly sign cuz Aries has got enough junk in it right right to give us problems right I hope you understood what brother Claud was saying cuz you know I talked to him later see you got the Zodiac just say a word word to make sure you understand you got the Zodiac that's covered just like so many days of a month and you got 12 signs for the year Y and that happens every month right you know but then he was talking about the heavenlies of way above that in that it comes around every 2100 years or something right M and you think about it there's 2,000 years from the Garden of Eden to the to the flood right see then Noah I mean Abraham comes on over there yeah after then right then you can move it on over 21 22 23 2400 years or something here comes Abraham along you know here comes Moses along see born under all them signs and things so don't get the two mixed together in your mind right right just listen to what the man was talking about we are in the age right and I've taught you over and over that brother Brown's message began in 1963 y the message that was to be brought beginning the seals right the other was a a restoration back to what it was already in the written form am that's right we're in the age of the water barrier the son of man that's right yes sir how many knows where I started that at 1969 brother brandham was talking about son of man in 1949 47 or something yep right but then he finally entered his ministry that's right in the correct order right we're in that day in that time amen cuz that that doesn't deal with son of man doesn't deal brother R was a son of man but in the body of Jesus Christ he's part of the son of man the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ in the body of the Bride of Jesus Christ okay get off that listen but you see brother Brown says you're Spirit was permitted y but not given now he's got to be explaining something because God is the only one that can give a spirit right even a body brother said you tell me how all of them wiggle taals and things running around in there he said it's not the first one it meets he said it's all predestination but when when you come into the world God permitted us in a fallen condition for Mama and Daddy to bring a body that we could live in that's right amen but that our spirit and our soul would be created of him to bring to us amen and that Soul being the real you that would make us perfect not Eternal but would make us what Mortal Mortal remember how you say it RT everybody SP that's right mortal beings all people right all people born in sin sa iniquity com from the world speaking lies I'm sorry if you think you were the only one that got left out of that situation I'd like for you to explain to me how you got it right cuz Jesus Christ didn't have to die one person could get it right that's right but now listen let's get down to something because this is what this is the message part then I believe that your soul is the real you amen we'll get down to one on the Redemption of the body one of these days and you know brother Gary I don't believe you're predestinated to look like me that's right that's right I believe we're living in the body that can be redeemed amen and we'll be turned back young right and we'll be Eternal one day amen that's right we're not going to get a new one n that's right we already got it so the predestinated plan of God is coming to pass right cuz remember it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally but the word or seed well if the word says these days the day of the change then that's predestinated right that's right right that's pre how brother how can you believe that we're going to take a chance I believe somebody is cuz it's predestinated which means Destiny was determined before the world ever begun amen that somebody was going to be standing here and that word and that Spirit would connect together and we'd be changed okay so you can see I'm way down here and the way up you where the message where I'm trying to get to all right see but what happened in the garden you know in the fall of mankind and all the way down and so just bring it on down to ourselves cuz like I've always told you when the baby's born I believe it the baby's born as I said the body is is perfect as can be made from Human elements of w coming you know in the perversion and life and Etc but still as perfect as can be and real good thank God for it and all them little parts are working in the work everything just right on time and even like Brother Gary the blood may run this way and run that away and mind and run that way and his but you know how this working he God made all of it you know I mean he didn't make it to be wrong but you might find out one of these days we're all wrong brother GE and you in the right shape like I've always said they say your heart is were it's right in the center you know but get on to it listen so what happens to a baby when it's born all right now as far as body and spirit when it's born it's just like any animal this morning did you understand what I said body and spirit it's so amazing though because in that body and spirit realm why don't we act like the animals I think we do sometimes monkeys that's all right but you can take a a baby and let it be crawling and you know what it'll come to the edge of a table and it'll just fall right off the floor right did you take a dog from the time it's just enough to where that they can almost hardly see or whatever you put it on the same table and it get to the edge and look off it won't fall maybe they're a little smarter than we think they are right my point is that there's a difference between the dog and the human what and that's the soul right that Soul has to be motivated or trained are you listening bird dogs are born bird dogs they have to be trained to make them good bird dogs yeah I'm better but they'll automatically point right I get tickled about it but thinking about how those dogs will do and cats will do and animals will do and cuz they born that is that nature about him that's right in that Spirit realm not no soul that's right Spirit real all right see so what happens to the baby God gives it life permits it to come lets it live gives it a soul Satan immediately takes over as I say you know and I like to make that illustration that there are the little babies laying in the cradle and has just been born right from the mother and just been stanked and Made Alive you know and here comes the nurse blankety blankety everybody fussed and arguing and screaming at each other you know and all these babies coming around and the poor little old things start starts off here and all that right you said does that have anything to do with it well where did we get the natures that we have oh yes of course I born under Aries who in here had born Leo who's who's Leo Brother D are you the Leo no he's a taus okay he's he's a bullhead I be hard he's a bull but see we blame that for that right yeah you know we can't help it and a lot of that has to do with it that's right but you know what brother R said about those angels that fail he said they give you a nature right those that fail give you a nature we found that back under about the ones that didn't fall they have to do with the ARs of Salvation is right but see the one ones that are Fallen then they jump right over on us and start perverting us what what part of you starts being perverted it's not the body right it's not the spirit it's the soul that begins to be perverted see then what's Satan doing he begins to revert us are see this what a lot of people don't agree with me about because they'll say the Soul's the nature the spirit Spirit is the nature of the Soul that's fine but what are you making it you just making it in nature then we're no more than an animal right we just we're just different in the point bird dog cuz they got that nature they survive they live they build their houses right what's the difference between us and a dog it's a soul right but that soul that nature of Us coming from God because only God can create I give you a quote I think in your something yeah the devil cannot create on anointed one the end time right the devil can't create then you go to the Oneness of unity 1958 brother said God made man to thirst Satan only perverts The Thirst it's what I told you no matter where you're born in the world you find people as are far north as you can go to alasas or Africa or anywhere and you find people worshiping they're God right why because they are a soul and that Soul knows that it's got a makeer right Satan then starts perverting the nature of that Soul amen it's not the soul Soul's okay right right he starts giving it a nature that's right starts telling you you got to be this because you're a zodiac sign I don't even read them I refuse to even read the zodiac sign right amen I've been that way for 40 years and I refuse cuz I used to read them and they' read in there boy you're going to be blessed today and I'd find out I always was blessed but then didn't say material wealth's coming your way not end today broke I quit yeah that's right I just refuse to even read you know why I do because see what I tried my best to tell you you think that zodiac sign is your controller and and you'll lean to it because you'll say I can't help it you'll blame somebody for what you are you'll say I'm just like my daddy right people tell you act just like your daddy why I want to act like my daddy from heaven right amen I don't have to act like my daddy dad my daddy had a lot of good traits about him what to say but I still don't want to be like him I want to be like my heavenly father brother CL said I found out I'm not the son of of Hannah and Sam Dale right I'm a Son of God Amen I want to act like my father I want to be led of that but get what I'm talking about look what I'm trying to get you to see the perversion and by that you'll see why we must be born again cuz Satan immediately starts upon the baby I don't care if it's born you know what I'm fixing say it's true it don't matter if Mom and Daddy are both Christians right that don't make the baby a Christian right he'll still lie y everything will take place and Mama Don't Lie daddy don't lie who was it the twins back there and brother BR said Mom and Daddy both was Christian one of those come forth acting like the devil the other one come forth acting on God's side what is it see Satan begins to he don't worry about your body sure cuz we're in a fallen domain yeah all right we're under the subject of sin yeah and all these things starts hitting the body yeah yeah but don't worry about the body right cuz the Bible says don't worry about the body right y he said don't worry about who can destroy the body right what does it say you better be concerned about he that can destroy the soul right amen okay Satan begins to deal with us and pervert the nature of that Soul he begins through memory reason conscience affections and things coming down into to pervert the nature of that Soul because we're one unit right that's why the soul that sinth it shall die why your New Birth has to come in the soul amen Satan starts dealing right there to pervert the nature he cannot create that's where you two Soul people said Satan give you a soul God give you a soul Satan cannot create I gave you that once the end time 130 paragraph 139 ano once the end time the devil cannot create anything that's right amen God made man to thirst Brother Richard Wilson was quoting one night uh not for life I guess we listening to him where he was talking about how that uh Moses born with that great gift he said and everybody is born that way you said no no he's born CU he no okay go ahead see God created the soul of man perfect placed it within the body of that M baby at birth of the baby Satan begins to pervert the nature of that Soul he begins to pervert the nature of it he it's not that it's that it's just a nature he begins to pervert the nature of that Soul that's right the Soul's real amen Satan begins to pervert the nature of it see see the soul is the real you Satan begins to deal with that to pervert that now when we'll get on down here in a minute you'll see that's where God has to start at right God has to start from the soul amen all right see see Satan cannot create but he perverts the nature of it he gives you his nature in China they got a Chinese spirit in America they got an American Spirit where' that come from all them Devils that fell in the beginning right you see you mean I got only them devils in me not only them devils in you it's just the anointing from them right the nature of them y see he perverts then the nature of our soul and automatically the body will act like it right right because the spirit of the man see you say well there quotes where brother said souls and nature of spirit spirits and nature of Soul that's all that's well and good but is it just a nature of something if you're saying it's just the nature of a spirit then you got anointed ones and you got a problem with them because they got the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on their Spirit right right that don't make them Christians right we'll get back on this the next message somewhere in there we we'll get into it see the new birth then is the birth of the soul look what brother brother says on cruelty to sin number eight on your notes 1953 403 made him out of the Dust of the earth now not in his own image he had already made the man so you know what he's talking about and the man that he created was was made in image of animal right then he breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living Soul so the soul of man is the nature of the spirit now when you're reborn you don't get a new spirit well I thought I thought the Bible says we get a new spirit remember when he was dealing back there that this Spirit he say in his soul you get a you get a new nature of that Spirit right it's the same Spirit but a new nature of it right he said you take two then let them stand out there one a sinner one a Christian he said you can't tell the difference one of them is a different is a different his soul his nature is different he's been changed right exactly right Something's Happened now we get to it with Ezekiel where he says you get a new heart and a new spirit cuz that's a justification so look what he says on the law and Grace 54 he's talking about you know the animal's blood it couldn't change his heart cuz an animal life won't compare with human life the animal can't give the human blood see the animal can't do it because his life is a different life and an animal has a life but not a soul right an animal is a living being but not a soul right but God put soul on man now you think I'm reading it wrong but you read it see God put soul on man so then my soul what is the soul the nature of the spirit right so the nature of the spirit right but see you just make it a nature bird dog rabit dog you know it's a nature if it's a nature then why can't it work we just getting the nature changed we just read up there you don't get a new spirit why wouldn't it be you just get a new spirit why wouldn't that work same nature because you the same thing on the inside right you ain't done nothing to S right see thirsting for Life 1958 611 he's talking about the soul thirsting and coming on down said you know my soul thirst for thee if your soul is what directs you it's what makes you what you are a conversion is list a soul is the nature of the spirit and when a man is converted he doesn't get another Spirit he gets a spirit change listen a conversion means to change his thinking change his way of living and so forth so my soul thirst for thee see it's not a change like exchange right right there's a Doctrine in the message called change of the soul and this sex change and it it just won't work listen to what he says on the message token 1963 901 the morning service now there's a life a blood a life and a soul in the life now listen to what he say the soul is the nature of the life right now remember this is on act 63 so now he's got the soul is the center part of you therefore it had no certain nature it was an animal see an animal he has no certain nature about him he's an animal he's got the nature of the animal yeah this what is it what is that one me Abby what koala koala is the one that eat certain leaves it'll only eat eucalyptus see that's his nature yep what you can turn around and tell him say hey look over on that tree right beside of you is a beautiful fruit wonderful taste got a whole lot more vitamins and minerals and the K is giv his heating his he keep on his eucalyptus you can't change him but see you tell a human my wife used to tell me when we first got got married she'd cooked okra and she'd say honey it's good ain't no way I said I don't care nothing about it you know what she done she started putting cornmeal in it and onions and cutting it up and thing putting it together and I'd eat the cornmeal I found that it taste pretty good y now I love okra amen you know why cuz I got a soul in me that can make a decision right but now listen therefore the blood stood for a token that the life had been given but in this glorious place under this Covenant there's a difference between the blood and the life the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not a blood a chemistry but it's the holy spirit of God that is the token that God requires of the church today and God meets us we must have that now listen Satan as I said he perverts the nature of your soul exactly right those demons that fail they come down and we don't believe in them being like you know some of them taught it that they come down and inhabit man and and and you know they become superhuman men and they've done this that and the other and all the doctrines they had about it back there no the prophet said no I don't believe that coming down press themselves into human flesh he said no said they give you a nature right why because they pervert the nature of your soul the nature of that Soul had to be pure to start with right because it God could not create it imp created imperfect Satan perverts that nature we come down through life and there's not much said because God understands that's what I love about it he said there's not much reset about you until you reach the age of accountability you say well what is that brother Dale you can't determine that for every person cuz some people their mentality may be to the point that they're 50 years old before they ever reach the age of accountability but some kids May reach it earlier because of their accountability so it's how much they can understand and accountability and comprehension but somewhere in life you reach a a a time that's called the age of accountability right around said then a tape is made and put in not much before then why because you're under the blood of Jesus Christ and all babies that are not reached the age of accountability that die you know before they reach the age of accountability all babies go to heaven amen I love that amen I always told you I used to wonder how God could tell them tell them people and children of is go out there and kill them amorites kill them every one men women children and all thought oh God why couldn't he go over and get just kill the men and women and just bring the babies home cuz I love babies you know why could he just bring them home with them you know and raise them up as Israelite babies you know you I said well Lord you know why why did you have them babies killed and one day he said he said I've done them a favor he said they' grown up they' have been big amorites and I'd have had to kill them send them to hell he said but that little amorites and he said all babies go to heaven I said Thank You Lord all babies that die for the age of accountability go to heaven no matter who they're born to Mom and Daddy's bad whatever it is brother said didn't have nothing to do with it but when you reach the age of accountability see don't blame nobody else for your perversion cuz when you reach the age of accountability you start accepting then what Satan has done right and how great it would have been for me as a young person and I remember that if I just listened to that being that I am I would have went out and done what I done you think about it you wouldn't have done it but instead I listen to The Devil in his ways my buddies and people around it perverted me so remember as I said now Satan perverts the nature of your soul he gives your soul a nature you soul is a nature well here's where your Prophet said it and I told a man up in Jeffersonville when he was talking about it and I said brother I said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's of the world he said how could a soul have a soul see all he knew was a nature Soul nature nature Soul that's all he knew I said you go talk to brother rown about I didn't say it you but I was going to argue with him about it I just said you go talk to brother brand but see Satan perverts your nature right amen makes us into a position to where that he is our King right now you said it when you got up old enough and I did too Saturday night came we didn't have no problems it was never a question are we going okay this said are we going to church tomorrow everybody understand why I said it that way there was never no doing that on the devil's side was it right you didn't say am I going out and follow the world tonight but now when it's serving God you well I don't know I I feel pretty bad well the church is a place to come where you feel bad amen right that's right you go away feel good right all right but you see Satan perverts the nature that's right of that Soul all right see that's why Jesus Christ had to come and watch it and study the study Matthew Mark Luke and John sometime just sit down and read them with this thought in mind and watch how the Lord Jesus would stand before them people and take the word he didn't have to discern them out I discern you got a bad spirit there not in the Bible that he said anything like that he just took the word and he started talking he never called them people Devils he said if you're that way your father your Devil's your father but he didn't call the father they had a deam choice he just started laying that word down and after a while looked at him and said you're talking about us he said Oh Glory you finally caught it I said I didn't do it I was talking about everybody Parables right right what was he doing let's see birth pain brother said it was hard to get those Pharisees to realize they were sinners now maybe Sadducees maybe religious something like but this is almost verba see it's hard to get them to realize they were Sinners we he could die for you know he didn't die for the righteous that's right is that according to the Bible right righteous don't need a savior he said it's hard to get them to realize they lost that's right so is it today folks hardest thing in the world to get the Believers of this message to realize they're lost right cuz he got all of the quotes always was eternal you can't get them to realize and search for God I told you about preaching that man's church that time and he said you got my people stirred up about seeking for God I said I'll never apologize for stirring the people up for seeking for God I'll apologize for preaching something in your church you didn't agree with but I will not apologize for trying to stir up people to get them to se go search for God that's right see because Satan begin now I know what brother R says he said said in the garden you know when the thing he said Satan took the head God took the heart now I know that so don't misunderstand Satan took the soul of mankind and perverted it amen that's right the nature of that Soul wound up perverted for his domain because that's what he started on right it was through the head you understand what the prophet said through the head through the memory reason conscience affections the see The Taste the feel the smell the hear and he begin to pervert God don't deal through seed taste feel smell and here he don't deal on memory reason conscious imagination affections he said oh yes no no he doesn't cuz he said brother BR said don't you go back there and try to talk them people into coming to the alar cuz he said you'll make them a two-fold child of hell you're dealing with their Spirit real or their body right he said don't do it you preach the gospel and let him come well I fail L of the lord well that's your choice you feel led of the Lord you do what God tells you to do but when this thing's over with you'll find out where that prophit was right or not you'll find out whether you led of the Lord that day or not he said Brother D I've never listened to anybody like you you never will probably well I'm in this world find anybody else as dumb as I am but I believe the gospel bless amen I believe in being born again amen and I went through that of people trying to get me into the altar it made me turn against coming to the altar amen now if it had been a real good person if brother Tatum let me say it that way if brother Tatum would have been there come back to me in the church and talk to me about God in his wonderful sweet way I would have walked with him to the altar but you know what I've told you before and they come and tried to tell me about Jesus Christ and come to church I said I live a better life you're a Deon board and I did and they couldn't argue the point brother R said it's the church that's right that's messed the whole thing up yep that's exactly right but watch now Satan begin at the soul to pervert the nature where does God begin he drops right down into that Soul he don't deal with your body and your spirit that's why there's so many religious people today they only to get it as far as their Spirit we'll get to that Sunday I got to hurry listen look at souls in prison preached in 1963 um 11:10 the morning service he said now this and he's talking about souls now in prison Souls that are now in prison now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul see and the soul is something that's the the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are hidden and God through Christ still by there by the Holy Ghost now it wasn't that your body died now he's talking about the new birth right right you talking about salvation now it wasn't your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of the your spirit died amen see the nature which is the soul amen now watch it the nature of your soul is is God if you're born again amen if it's not it's of the world right so the nature of our soul is of God if we're born again right if not it's the nature of the world Amen it's not just Souls the nature the spirit go right on down reading because of continuation when so when you see this man walking down the street thinking he's somebody you know and got a little education and things you're you remember it's a clot of Indiana dust that's all and that woman that's all dressed in shorts and smoking cigarettes and carrying on down the street twisting like she owned the whole country it's a clot of Indiana dust and that that's the way it's turning back so you're not very much to begin with see so that that's right that's what you are but that Soul that's in Dy that soul is where is that soul is what God's working on he's not working on your body he's not working on your spirit watching see if he can only get that nature of that Spirit to agree with him then the nature dies amen the nature and the love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead see because you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not in you and when and a man must be born again so this Nature has to die and the nature of God comes and lives in you and God is the only thing there is that never did begin or never can End Amen right now it can give this one but it's continuation of the reading same message so therefore he has partnershi you and taken this man Earthly and this eternal spirit and put it together because God reflected himself back in in that he became a man when he became Christ Jesus and he was God see God was in Christ lived in him reconciled the world to himself and through that perfect man each one of us imperfect that believe in God and has accepted that becomes a Perfection of him amen so what's he working on God begins to work on your soul to change the nature of it why because it had a nature of the world so what is the new birth what is the new birth it's the birth of the Soul not the birth of the body not the birth of the spirit it's the birth of the Soul that's why I don't try to get people to and I know people don't like his statements but I don't try to get them to come to church brother R said I don't believe we're getting them to Christ we're just getting them to church right right now do you misunderstand that that's you got a problem because I invite people to church yeah but I'm not trying to get nobody body from anywhere to come to this church you I always just tell everybody and you know it's probably been told to you I said if you come to the church just because you want to come to church you'll be a hindrance to me and I'll be a hindrance to you right but if you want to come and seek God and try to find the word then we're here right all right we walk on in God and try to to make this thing and come out of it in the right manifestation right cuz I believe in the birth of the word right cuz he got to plant that word and we'll get to it Sunday then when planting that word according to read future home between now and Sunday or listen to the message pay close attention about page 14 15 16 17 and you'll see what he explaining then you burth right that unclean Spirit has to be driven out before God can come in y that unclean spirit is the devil's nature that was given to our soul by perversion God begins on that soul to try to plant that seed of the word right to drive that unclean Spirit out but just because it's driven out doesn't mean you're saved you re future home just because that unclean Spirit goes out the Bible says be careful because he'll come back in the state of the person be seven times worse amen the new birth is a birth of the Soul amen amen to try to bring God's nature that's it right there into our being amen not into our body not into our spirit bring it into the soul the body and spirit will follow the soul amen the battle that people have is they try to become Christians in spirit realm and then they have troubles why because the flesh is a problem yielding one way and God is trying to gring them another way and they just a constant battle you see Jesus Christ had to give his life he had to give his soul a ransom that's right not just an anointing of a spirit right he had to give his soul a ransom for you and I and if that wasn't the soul of God we are lost amen amen that's right but if that was the soul of almighty God then we have a hopes of eternal life that's right come on think on these things that's right think on these things are you born again what do you mean brother Dale I've got all of the signs in I didn't ask you that right Paul run into people there that were really great people and he said if you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost since you believe that's right they were proven and that the one a poish them that was appren that Jesus was the Christ by the scriptures right amen sure was but he said you need to be born again amen that's right what about it yes but brother Dale I can't deny because if I deny him he'll deny me good old Baptist Doctrine not much salvation in it but a good old Baptist Doctrine if you was ever there you'd know what I'm saiding is the truth cuz they'll say I've got to believe I've Got to Believe In The Father Son and Holy Ghost cuz if I don't believe in the father Son and Holy Ghost the Bible says I'm lost yeah well I do too I Believe In Father Son Holy Ghost amen I just don't believe it the way they do than on these things stand for 566 and power 566 anybody
