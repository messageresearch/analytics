[0:00] alright alright for those of you they
[0:02] have not been here we are doing a lesson
[0:07] on when the prophet of God talked about
[0:10] three sons name so we eat the Sun God
[0:13] son of man son David so we are now on
[0:17] the son of man we went through the Son
[0:22] of God we know the Son of God was what
[0:25] that's the spirit a spirit god that's
[0:27] the dodge the Creator that's the one
[0:31] that has no sin he has no he never
[0:33] failed he didn't need salvation he
[0:35] didn't mean Redemption right that's the
[0:38] all mighty that's God himself all right
[0:40] no but as we fell from that because
[0:45] remember Adam was the son of God right
[0:46] all right because he had what god in his
[0:49] soul the man blessed be his name brother
[0:52] Branson's basically they have God
[0:54] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[0:55] he became a living soul but he became
[0:57] the Bible said in Luke I believe it was
[1:00] when you go through the chronology the
[1:01] flu but Luke says I which was the son of
[1:05] God and the only Son of God in the Old
[1:07] Testament as we seen many times before
[1:10] and you know I don't know having
[1:13] disrepair I don't know how you believe
[1:14] this but this is why we believe in
[1:16] Turkey this jerk that no one was a son
[1:19] of God in the Old Testament Abraham was
[1:21] never called something God Abraham was
[1:22] called a friend of God because they did
[1:25] not have after Adam fell there was no
[1:29] way that God could enter the soul of man
[1:31] but if I understand that that to me
[1:33] that's the most simple thing you can
[1:34] realize he couldn't enter into Abraham
[1:38] soul and may god make Abraham soul
[1:41] eternal while he was on earth no we know
[1:45] Abraham like brother dale has been
[1:47] preaching he's but he was saved he's
[1:48] he's part of the plan of God but he's
[1:52] not the brightest Jesus Christ and in
[1:54] front he servants Abraham Isaac Jacob
[1:57] and Joseph or one there though they're
[1:59] the corner
[2:00] nation that the christian church is
[2:02] built upon but they are not the bride of
[2:05] Jesus Christ the man Isaiah's not part
[2:09] of the bride of Jesus Christ now he
[2:11] prophesied and spoke in the first person
[2:13] God would come down and anoint him then
[2:17] he would anoint him and then an
[2:19] anointing would leave that's the same
[2:20] way with David the anointing would come
[2:22] on David and he'd speak in the first
[2:23] person and then but now when that left
[2:27] David now David he had the new birth
[2:29] that we have today he'd never went to
[2:32] bed with Bathsheba he never had his best
[2:34] friend kill because the characteristic
[2:37] these characteristics of God were not in
[2:40] his soul it was a murderer he had blood
[2:45] on his hand that's what God told him you
[2:47] can't build a temple because you got
[2:49] blood on your hand and remember in the
[2:51] old testament what blood covered their
[2:54] sin the blood of bulls and goats covered
[2:58] it didn't eradicate it did not do away
[3:01] with David's in it only covered David's
[3:04] in until Calvary when Calvary come the
[3:07] blood of Jesus Christ cleansed all the
[3:10] way from Adam all the way to the end of
[3:12] time America but in the Old Testament
[3:16] they only had the bulls and goats
[3:19] because this son of God could not come
[3:23] down in a formal son of man until the
[3:26] word said he was a virgin shall conceive
[3:30] Isaiah I was asking a virgin shall
[3:32] conceive go Jesus has talked over many
[3:35] times in the scripture we went through
[3:36] the book of his ego I'm trying to hurry
[3:37] through to get us up to speed but
[3:39] Ezekiel son of man prophesied Son of Man
[3:42] prophesize son of man prophesied and if
[3:45] you'll watch let's go back to Ezekiel
[3:48] and let's look just for see how perfect
[3:51] the Bible is we've already been through
[3:53] this book
[3:53] a long time that's all right y'all see
[3:55] that pretty little Vera if you don't
[3:57] feel pretty that's my grandbaby she's
[4:01] beautiful she's mine I forgot what it's
[4:05] doing now is go to ya thank ya we're
[4:08] gonna going to leave you now yeah let's
[4:12] go to buca Deanna back in five Ezekiel
[4:18] on here I'll mash it all right what when
[4:20] we own is Eve your one let's look at the
[4:22] DQ 1 and then door to now who is Ezekiel
[4:26] Ezekiel was one of those men that God
[4:30] used in the Old Testament that was under
[4:32] the blood of bulls and goats a sacrifice
[4:34] but he was a prophet and a prophet is a
[4:37] conduit for God you know what conduit is
[4:40] kind of do it is around tube that things
[4:42] flow through you can put electricity
[4:43] electric lines you put water line you
[4:46] can put whatever but in a conduit as a
[4:48] way to get from here to here so what
[4:51] happened was the son of God in back in
[4:55] the Garden of Eden before the fall the
[4:57] conduit without him right the conduit
[5:02] was Adam Adam was going to produce all
[5:04] this Genesis 1 26 min right but now what
[5:09] happened probably God says flues got
[5:12] stopped out why what happened that
[5:14] conduit got closed off but in Genesis 3
[5:18] 15 oh I said I'll put enmity I'm going
[5:22] to come and do it like other deals
[5:23] talking about stairs in the
[5:25] unconditional covenant God said I'm
[5:27] going to do it I'm going to do it I'm
[5:30] not gonna send a single person I'm not
[5:32] going to send a third person I'm coming
[5:33] myself and I'm going to come down in the
[5:36] form of man because this didn't fall
[5:39] right hey man when gon put this man into
[5:44] Adam and that man into flesh that's what
[5:48] felt the flesh of Adam failed the
[5:53] spiritual part of Adam as far as the
[5:55] spirit in his body that's what felt Adam
[5:58] sold in fall he knew what he was doing
[6:00] the property God said bro yeah man so he
[6:03] knew what he was doing and he was
[6:04] the Son of God all right okay but he
[6:07] took what if he fell in flesh he didn't
[6:10] fall into the pit in palo de sol he fell
[6:13] in flesh so God had to come down into
[6:16] human flesh to clean that conduit out
[6:19] but he had many conduits Isaiah Jeremiah
[6:21] Ezekiel he had a conduit that he could
[6:24] just blow through speak what he needed
[6:26] to speak and then back away from them
[6:28] yeah right because they had many falls
[6:31] in the Old Testament Samson not look at
[6:34] me they all have many flaws but you know
[6:35] when God gets over there the Hebrews 11
[6:38] and then he goes over to Romans now look
[6:41] I Abraham gave his wife away twice yes
[6:45] that's 42 times try that one time Adam
[6:55] gave his wife will hate twice he didn't
[6:57] just sniggering God the Bible said he
[6:59] got down on his face and laugh that's
[7:01] right but now go to Romans Paul looks
[7:07] back through the blood of Jesus Christ
[7:08] and he says Abraham was strong in faith
[7:13] what read the commentary you don't look
[7:17] like that but when you put it through
[7:19] the filter you gotta run it back through
[7:21] the blood of jesus christ when you run
[7:23] into the blood of jesus christ see that
[7:24] eradicate said it doesn't discovery it
[7:26] on the blood of all the ghost was
[7:28] covering it but when Jesus come he
[7:31] didn't come to just be what he come just
[7:34] to be an animal he was a human had a
[7:37] human soul baby with God remember God
[7:41] doing human there ever was a man this
[7:44] man is a body you can say oh no he's a
[7:47] spirit that's not the problem we have is
[7:48] we stayed spirit and we think of like
[7:51] Casper the Friendly Ghost ER or
[7:53] something that has not if we were made
[7:56] in his image and his likeness he must
[7:58] have been pretty real before even Adam
[8:03] was put in flesh he must have been
[8:05] pretty real because brother and said
[8:06] that I am controlled the whole earth
[8:08] while he was in that Genesis 126 Tate
[8:11] and then when he put it into 27 it was
[8:14] so he could walk
[8:14] the earth and he could touch things and
[8:16] he can be a few that's why God will got
[8:18] all the one being human yes the man so
[8:21] there's your human that's for real when
[8:23] you say no this is this is what this is
[8:27] real this is more real than this man
[8:31] what's more real me that I can't walk
[8:33] through this wall RF or if I were to
[8:36] pass away this moment you wouldn't have
[8:38] thought the door for my soul to get out
[8:40] always wouldn't more real the soul the
[8:43] man's more real than anything that you
[8:46] can comprehend or our think up because
[8:49] remember in this form God talking to
[8:51] Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden in
[8:52] this form this man right here killed two
[8:58] lambs gave one Adam pull the skins off
[9:03] of it get one out of the one to eat now
[9:05] you can't do that as a spirit that has
[9:07] no form artha has no substance okay so
[9:11] we see that God has always been a man
[9:14] God has never been anything but a man
[9:16] right he's never been a woman but
[9:20] remember he had that spirit just like
[9:22] Adam I mean I don't can't be no
[9:23] different than god so like I said many
[9:25] times before God come tearing the garden
[9:28] he looks at him and he said man I got
[9:29] looks like me come he was before he came
[9:33] from he came from Almighty God alright
[9:36] so then this man goes through the Old
[9:38] Testament as what Jehovah God God of
[9:40] others he could not come down and talk
[9:43] to the people in his human flesh you
[9:48] understand that because remember he
[9:49] spoke he spoke a piece of flesh and
[9:52] existence in Melchizedek and spoke to
[9:55] Abraham but that man Melchizedek he
[9:58] doesn't matter people's God Almighty and
[9:59] human flesh he could not save your soul
[10:01] he couldn't save items I mean huh hey
[10:03] Prem salt cuz that's not kinsman that's
[10:08] spoken into existence poking out of
[10:09] existence that's not kinsman this is not
[10:11] the way we come so many ancestors may
[10:14] wish that's the way we come
[10:15] but no we came by birth by birth through
[10:19] the womb that's where everything kind of
[10:21] got started within the womb of the mind
[10:22] and then manifested in the womb of the
[10:25] flesh all right so that's one of this
[10:27] son of man had to come God in human
[10:31] flesh a baby a man baby we believe in
[10:36] his church and without baby was born
[10:38] that was God that was a sec a person
[10:40] that wasn't that wasn't a human man and
[10:43] then God entered him later up that was
[10:45] oh my god man because the Bible says
[10:48] when he was born he was born Emmanuel
[10:50] which means God with us ok so there's a
[10:52] scripture for that what was God with us
[10:55] he was God in human flesh calling
[10:58] himself the Son of Man because remember
[11:01] they didn't understand that then
[11:03] understand who that was but we'll talk
[11:06] about that a second but look what it
[11:07] says here Ezekiel says he said unto me
[11:09] son of man capital S or what's he fixing
[11:12] to do he's fixing to prophesied what did
[11:16] the Old Testament Saints do they
[11:18] prophesied of everything that was coming
[11:20] too fast Ezekiel would have loved to sit
[11:23] here today and listen because you know
[11:24] what he would understand his own writing
[11:27] sometimes they didn't understand their
[11:28] own writing can you imagine that my
[11:30] brother Brown said Isaiah would go home
[11:32] and go honey I said versions you're
[11:34] conceived today but I just really you
[11:36] know he didn't help he said ain't ever
[11:38] out before you know so why I say that
[11:40] but you know what he was the conduit
[11:42] whenever God said come down through the
[11:44] tube and come out they didn't interpret
[11:48] remember they had no interpreter we have
[11:53] an interpreter the Holy Ghost they can
[11:54] interpret the word they had no
[11:56] interpreter in their soul to go through
[11:58] that filter for them to be able to say I
[12:01] know what this is no even Paul says I
[12:04] see google glass a glass darkly is
[12:06] Jeremiah Ezekiel all the was pointing
[12:08] toward Israel being saved a Gentile
[12:12] Church going in but they really I don't
[12:14] think I really don't think that they
[12:16] understood everything that was going on
[12:18] okay I just don't and they did because
[12:21] you watch some of them that we call
[12:23] in there pull away and go o Israel why
[12:27] did we say this you know where what's
[12:28] going on you but remember Paul didn't
[12:31] have a question about that because Paul
[12:33] was a born again God in his soul profit
[12:36] the man so God could interpret coming
[12:39] down through the conduit he can
[12:41] interpret what he was saying and he can
[12:44] speak it out because remember Jesus was
[12:47] not a conduit of God he was gone okay so
[12:51] when he spoke that's why we were we're
[12:53] we're getting a little help myself but
[12:55] see that capital s cap the last Son of
[12:57] Man so he fits into top capital s that's
[13:01] what God heaven that's that the Lord
[13:03] then you'll see down to here he'll be
[13:05] talking to Ezekiel and thou son of man
[13:10] they talking to the man is equal be not
[13:12] afraid of them now this right here ain't
[13:15] afraid he was afraid of nothing right
[13:18] but as they kill a thief young son of
[13:23] man little ass he's talking straight to
[13:25] Ezekiel these other ones are talking
[13:28] from Ezekiel to you and me if I
[13:30] understand that engine that's the big
[13:32] ass that's the capital S you look at the
[13:34] Bible's perfect the Bible perfect
[13:37] winning even the uppercase and lowercase
[13:39] uppercase to lowercase then you'll see
[13:42] where that's capital capital comp
[13:43] accountable there's a different meaning
[13:45] of that word in the Bible a man brother
[13:48] they all men do that many times and it's
[13:50] a wonderful revelation because you read
[13:52] the Bible better that way because you
[13:54] can you get confused I wish you can
[13:58] watch it
[14:03] right here I send thee to the children
[14:07] visual now he didn't sure he said the
[14:10] person is equal but who did he send to
[14:12] Israel Jesus himself I come to my own he
[14:17] said so he's saying son of man I send
[14:19] thee to the children Israel this one but
[14:25] his ego was the conduit in that day to
[14:27] what to get the people ready brother
[14:29] branham said they the prophets built the
[14:31] body for Jesus to come in ok they didn't
[14:35] build the 16 l of months of calcium no
[14:38] they built the word so that when Jesus
[14:40] walked out he fulfilled all the Old
[14:43] Testament scripture to you oh yeah look
[14:46] so that's that's getting us to the point
[14:50] to where then we see Jesus everybody
[14:55] stand that Ezekiel you even look in the
[14:56] Old Testament there's only a few times
[14:58] that the Son of Man is used in the Old
[14:59] Testament but watch here in Matthew you
[15:03] know I try to remember which one is here
[15:05] is gonna bring my note for that and it
[15:07] knows going backwards is far where's one
[15:09] where he says who does that let's see
[15:10] 1660 hang on man I'll find it
[15:17] right there I think you more verse 13
[15:21] when Jesus came to the coast accessory
[15:23] Philip I he asked his disciples saying
[15:25] whom do men whom do men say I the sun
[15:32] capital of man am well that revelation
[15:38] it without the Holy go they're guessing
[15:41] they're going by what the Old Testament
[15:44] is saying by the letter all right and
[15:47] they said some say that thou art John
[15:50] the Baptist goes member jointed already
[15:51] been killed some say Elijah and others
[15:55] Jeremiah or one of the prophets why
[15:57] because these people spoke of what he
[15:59] was going to do and he was standing
[16:00] there doing it all right if I understand
[16:03] that now the watch but whom say ye that
[16:08] I am a man now watch this this is a good
[16:12] revelation 22 to see that that we've
[16:17] come up in Revelation since even since
[16:20] uh since this was spoken he said him but
[16:23] whom say ye that I am in Simon Peter
[16:26] answered and said thou art the Christ
[16:28] the Son of the Living didn't say he told
[16:34] him some melon he told him those from
[16:37] God look because the Sun God revelation
[16:40] is that what God is going to come and
[16:43] the Messiah in human flesh but they
[16:47] didn't know that's who he was right
[16:49] remember Thomas doubting Thomas Jesus
[16:55] appeared to him in a glorified state and
[16:58] Peter went fishing tell me you had a
[17:01] revelation who that was he did not have
[17:03] a revelation through that 1p I always
[17:05] knew that was it's like I'm saying yeah
[17:07] if I saw somebody died and I helped put
[17:11] him in the grave and then I went back in
[17:13] the grave was empty and that same man
[17:15] appeared to me three days later you
[17:17] couldn't get me out of his sight
[17:20] the Peter went fishing Jesus appeared to
[17:24] players it and I like I want to go
[17:26] fishing on nobody will say well I loaned
[17:31] the money here I gotta waste money the
[17:35] revelation that I love is to make the
[17:37] difference between the open today and
[17:40] when they came to Israel and when they
[17:43] came to Israel nervous and that's right
[17:47] we can I see what and that's a good
[17:49] point thank you because you can go back
[17:50] to zekiel Ezekiel every time you see
[17:53] some ancestor set forth when I jesus
[17:55] never send us that board he was sold all
[17:58] right he watch the Lord so there's your
[17:59] difference in the son of man that he's
[18:02] talking to an Ezekiel in the Sun man
[18:04] that's on the earth but now we got to
[18:06] get this son of man back on earth again
[18:08] right right cuz we go read in just a
[18:11] minute watch this watch how this all
[18:13] involves from from 16 to 17 because the
[18:16] man this is matthew 16 17 they went on a
[18:19] mountain right to watch this thou art
[18:22] the Christ the Son of the Living God you
[18:25] didn't tell him that you were guarding
[18:27] him in class he said I know there's one
[18:28] thing for sure they something different
[18:29] about you all right there's something
[18:32] different you must be somebody difficult
[18:34] look they were going yeah they were
[18:36] going Elias and this one and badge on
[18:40] the badness and other one the Prophet
[18:43] but Peter got close enough jesus
[18:48] answered and said on him blessed or
[18:50] cursed island park going for flesh and
[18:51] blood has not revealed it unto thee but
[18:54] my father which is in heaven who is that
[18:56] right flesh and blood I did reveal that
[19:00] turn so he didn't know that flesh and
[19:01] blood one yes and I say I believe that
[19:04] thou art Peter and upon this rock now we
[19:06] know brother I'm said it was a
[19:07] revelation what of the Sun God not the
[19:10] son of man because remember what he
[19:13] given the keys to the kingdom what and
[19:15] upon this rock I will build my church he
[19:19] didn't build the church on the Son of
[19:20] Man revelation until the end time
[19:25] property guy said he died Son of Man
[19:27] hero son died and he was son
[19:30] God's Spirit God through seven churchy
[19:32] sure it was God in human flesh but there
[19:35] was no revelation the you're literally
[19:39] God made manifest in another form a man
[19:43] because look I'll build my church in
[19:46] other words on this revelation the Sun
[19:48] God because we're going to read in a
[19:51] minute my Jesus in Matthew 17 to tell
[19:54] this vision of nobody until it suddenly
[19:55] be risen again alright because when the
[19:58] son of man rose the first time when he
[20:00] ascended he came back as the Son of God
[20:03] alright he came back as a son of God
[20:05] through seven Church agents right that's
[20:07] what enough so watch local seven
[20:09] churches his church his church was the
[20:13] seven churches on this rock or this
[20:16] revelation of the Son of God I'll build
[20:18] my church and the gates now shall not
[20:20] prevail against it but remember the Son
[20:26] of Man revelations got to come to change
[20:28] your body and I will give them the
[20:30] leader keys to the kingdom once you over
[20:32] that vinyl earth I'll binding heaven
[20:33] push over the lutheran air pollution
[20:36] heaven for left him alone for just a
[20:38] little while then he charges the samples
[20:40] they should tell no man that he was
[20:42] Jesus the Christ but what's this Matthew
[20:47] 17 we can do that yeah Matthew 17 after
[20:53] six church ages
[21:01] after not dirty after six church ages
[21:05] and settle the church age Jesus takes
[21:10] these three up on the mountain you
[21:13] understand more when you own the
[21:14] mountain alright mountain okay and was
[21:22] transfigured before them what body chain
[21:25] potential now remember he went change
[21:27] right then he was changed later but
[21:29] that's Road rancid potentially he was
[21:31] showing the adoption showing what who
[21:35] was winning a lot of them now who was
[21:38] that that's the sunday be coming in
[21:41] because there's two okay they're from
[21:43] they're going to go where to the Jews
[21:45] that's what somebody said those that
[21:47] believe it was brobama City wish I
[21:48] preach on that because that that gets
[21:50] some of God's Son of Man son David all
[21:52] in about ten scriptures yeah so I did I
[21:55] think I'll do that maybe next time off
[21:57] and hall just creatures message on it
[21:59] couple hours to three hours ceremony way
[22:04] space shine his son is Raven white is
[22:06] alive and behold there appeared to him
[22:08] Mose no idea what talking to him brother
[22:10] Brown said they were telling him what he
[22:12] was going to have to do further in the
[22:14] kingdom then was things Jesus didn't
[22:19] know in his human brain okay he was
[22:22] Almighty God but they will finish when
[22:25] guy came into this human body he had a
[22:27] physical human brain like me and you and
[22:29] he had problems he had you know Satan
[22:31] same bout I don't it on him just like
[22:33] you pelled on us hey man we're not
[22:37] immune if they get saying can speak to
[22:39] him I've always said it's saying can
[22:40] talk straight to God yeah how many times
[22:43] in the Bible you said saying comes up to
[22:45] God or the devil comes up
[22:46] hey let me go to bed we can't get an
[22:49] audience with him most of the time with
[22:50] the devil can talk them all the time
[22:52] okay okay but there appears a moes their
[22:56] lives are talking with them because
[22:57] those are the two prophets not the two
[22:59] people now the spirit the spirit of
[23:02] Moses and Elijah are going to two
[23:03] prophets to do what uh sure he had the
[23:06] Millennium which is the son of David
[23:08] which is what heir to the throne man
[23:11] because remembering will reading coach
[23:13] will not do that yet but we'll go back
[23:15] in David where he promised David that
[23:17] his son nah Solomon but his son
[23:19] spiritually would sit on the throne and
[23:22] rule the twelve tribes of Israel now
[23:24] that's a son David but this is heading
[23:26] toward it he had to go die for us first
[23:29] all right then answered Peter you're
[23:31] Peter again Lord is good for us to be
[23:34] here if thou wilt let's make your free
[23:35] time and I was going to leave one for
[23:36] Moses one for lighting while he is paid
[23:39] the bright cloud blown Leibrandt cloud
[23:41] in here hello a bright cloud
[23:48] overshadowed them they weren't excluded
[23:52] it was everybody and behold a voice out
[23:55] of the cloud which said this is my
[23:57] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[23:59] here eating him so he come to the stage
[24:02] of adoption in other words where if
[24:05] you're going to get it you're going to
[24:06] get it from this man this is the man of
[24:07] the hour this is who well I believe
[24:09] brother Brown had to be overshadowed by
[24:10] cloud out in Arizona and he received his
[24:13] sonship i believe they hear ye him to
[24:16] preach the seals because that was going
[24:17] around messy what's the seals right the
[24:20] other part was restoration but you got
[24:22] to have that before you can have the
[24:25] ministry of what subtle man what we're
[24:29] talking about here what that everybody
[24:32] ok bye going to pass sorry and when the
[24:35] disciples hurting they fell on their
[24:37] face and was so afraid what they didn't
[24:39] understand then us then what's happened
[24:40] they having your birthday no one's going
[24:42] on all right gee just came in touch them
[24:44] hallelujah instead arise and be not
[24:47] afraid then they lift it up your eyes
[24:49] and they saw no man save Jesus home one
[24:52] God
[24:54] one God revelation Peter said three he
[24:57] said one a man and as they came down
[25:01] from the mountain Jesus charged him
[25:03] saying tell the vision to knowing until
[25:07] the Sun because a man be risen but again
[25:12] now again means you did it one time
[25:14] you're going to do it again right son of
[25:18] man be risen again from the dead now
[25:23] what's the next thing yeah you gotta
[25:25] keep going and his disciples asked him
[25:28] saying why then say this crimes have you
[25:30] lied you must first come the Jews know
[25:34] this remember I did that study we needed
[25:36] upstairs I did that several years ago
[25:37] about the five cups of Elijah the Jews
[25:40] know every year when they have there
[25:42] when they have their Jubilee or when
[25:46] they have this their feast of tabernacle
[25:49] they set a cut down for e object when
[25:54] you're sitting on the table show the
[25:56] picture of it there's a cup sitting
[25:58] there it's called a cup of Elijah they
[26:00] go outside and they opened the door and
[26:02] they look down the street and if allies
[26:04] if they ever seen him coming we'll stay
[26:06] well but they that's good let's see it
[26:16] look out and they go we don't see Elijah
[26:17] and then they say in the Jewish tongue
[26:19] until next year and they put the cup up
[26:22] they know Elijah has to come on the
[26:24] scene before Jesus class come but they
[26:27] missed when John the John coming of
[26:30] Elijah when Jesus came they miss that
[26:33] then they missed the part of brother
[26:35] Brown coming they miss that oh brother
[26:38] Brown would have went to Israel it have
[26:40] been over people yeah it'll been over it
[26:43] been finished they would have seen that
[26:45] side of the Messiah and they when I took
[26:47] correct
[26:49] member God told you don't go there
[26:50] nowhere in other words the Gentiles are
[26:53] not finished yet but look television
[26:55] told us total something that be risen
[26:57] again from the dead now to me i'm i'm
[27:00] gonna i'm going to interpolate they're
[27:03] asking him how is it going to happen
[27:06] because they're asking why then say
[27:08] scribes they were hearing the preacher
[27:10] say that elijah must first got jesus
[27:13] said he lies truly shall first come and
[27:16] restore all things John the Baptist did
[27:20] not restore that all veins now he
[27:25] restored the faith of the old testament
[27:28] to the New Testament right he was the
[27:31] hinge or the dole you know the hinge of
[27:33] the daughters from the old testament to
[27:35] the new he said he last true this your
[27:37] first come and restore all paints
[27:39] brother brown this is what brother Brown
[27:41] said tyla all loose ends the man that's
[27:46] what he said he said this Elijah will
[27:48] come to what Todd all loose ends well we
[27:51] can interpolate I believe right there
[27:52] and put a brother branham in that Park
[27:56] showing that that's what he's talking
[27:59] about but look watch now God hides it in
[28:01] the scripture because most of your
[28:04] denominational people say well that was
[28:05] alive dealt with join of evidence period
[28:09] but he said something else he's not
[28:12] continuing this fall he's still on the
[28:15] same talk but he's not continuing it but
[28:17] i say to you that allies has come
[28:19] already not bad Eli's the one they
[28:24] figure out he's what jhanda baby Eli's
[28:29] has come already and then you and not
[28:31] but have done it in watch wherever
[28:33] they're listing no words echoes hello
[28:34] yeah he said I'm the voice of one crying
[28:36] in the wilderness he fulfilled all those
[28:38] scriptures John the Baptist if but this
[28:40] is not gone about it this is that
[28:43] forthcoming of Elijah right here today
[28:45] because what the son of man had to die
[28:48] brother Brown said they buried him in
[28:50] two
[28:51] nationalism and Baron a miniature
[28:54] changes in denominationalism but he used
[28:57] to rise again in the end time that why
[28:59] do you need to rise again to change our
[29:02] money nobody's ever took a body
[29:04] champagne in the Sabbath church ages
[29:08] where the body chains come after six
[29:10] days did happen six church a happened
[29:19] after six churches in this church a
[29:21] writer this one office hey both this is
[29:27] your hands point though if this man
[29:29] don't come back this man don't show up
[29:32] all right this minute don't come back
[29:35] this man don't show up so this is your
[29:37] this is this to me what sure we have the
[29:40] Holy Spirit but we also have flesh now
[29:44] look we're one we era where arrow Jesus
[29:47] Christ right Romans 8 where heirs and
[29:52] joint heirs with Christ whatever Christ
[29:54] has we get a man hundreds Olaf's on a
[29:58] man has to rise again in the end time
[30:01] and that's what we're going to talk
[30:03] about next Sunday is the prophets
[30:06] message because truly both listen Peter
[30:11] preached this thank you a perfect man in
[30:14] about 80 60 Peter Praet step brother
[30:21] branham this was not a new doctrine
[30:24] Peter preached this right Paul preached
[30:27] one dawn first Peter priests one God
[30:31] first so truly what the Allies had to
[30:37] come again and restore all things
[30:39] because what happened in these other
[30:41] church ages what during six Church ages
[30:43] what happened they brought in father son
[30:44] Holy Ghost baptism they brought in
[30:46] eternal hell they brought in all
[30:49] those doctrines that I listened I knew
[30:52] that was gonna happen he waited the
[30:56] eight minutes of man a man because
[30:58] remember John Wesley John Wesley Martin
[31:05] Luther were born again prophets of god
[31:08] church aids messengers and talk trinity
[31:12] now somehow their conduit and that part
[31:16] got stopped up but God was still able to
[31:20] use them because he wanted Luther the
[31:22] brain to just shall live by faith that's
[31:24] all sanctification through what John
[31:28] Wesley and the gifts coming back for the
[31:31] Pentecostal but he had to come back
[31:32] again the son of man had to come again
[31:34] in flesh not just one man William Brown
[31:38] remember he said I'm a son of man
[31:41] revealing these intimate all right
[31:45] because the son of man to me is the
[31:47] bride of Jesus Christ the bride of Jesus
[31:51] Christ that stands on the earth when
[31:53] they take the body change is the real
[31:55] son of man revelation all right the rest
[31:58] are going to have to die and go by the
[31:59] grade the rest are going up to maybe
[32:02] later on you know even you can't have
[32:05] both any bride no bride can be here
[32:09] after the after the resurrection and the
[32:12] Ascension right so no right so that that
[32:14] stops all that whatever is left is
[32:16] foolish virgin and cup of water my name
[32:18] and all those things it's got to go
[32:20] through the tribulation I just noticed
[32:24] what
[32:25] why sure thirsty Bevin you guys
[32:31] traditional home first and restore all
[32:34] things right period that's why I said
[32:36] there is a period easily finish that
[32:38] thought that's know that it goes on it
[32:40] she oh it should be in our thinking it
[32:44] should be no no I never thought that
[32:46] that's a period that stops that fall now
[32:51] he's speaking directly to the people but
[32:53] I say unto you wait what's he doing he's
[32:57] picking up the thoughts of the people
[32:58] that are there because they're going
[33:02] talking about but I said you knew the
[33:06] life has come already all right so he's
[33:08] settling the people that are talking to
[33:10] him they're settling at this we you know
[33:12] and I know that John come but he didn't
[33:17] restore all things no he was just the
[33:20] voice of one crying in the wilderness he
[33:21] was introduced on my side because
[33:23] remember remember what the angel said
[33:25] the angel told brother branham on the
[33:27] river he didn't say you would for run
[33:30] and he said your message always if you
[33:34] read the quote brother Graham never said
[33:36] that the angel said you will for around
[33:39] a second he said your message will for
[33:41] run to second because it's in the days
[33:43] of the boys remember and in Revelations
[33:46] 10 we take the book not from the seven
[33:49] church age messenger we take the book
[33:51] from the mighty angel compose a mighty
[33:54] angel sure no it's not but it is is this
[33:58] man revealing himself through human
[34:00] flesh so you and I today with a
[34:04] revelation den of the seven seals are
[34:06] the son of man made manifest because
[34:08] what programs did Jesus were that was
[34:10] the seals that's the part they did not
[34:12] understand they didn't understand that
[34:14] that was the man god himself standing
[34:19] there cuz some say or what your likeness
[34:23] I'm tell you you're my something I met
[34:25] you they was people with all through
[34:27] them the land
[34:29] mass back as he comes back no God's back
[34:34] all right God with us now God above us
[34:37] God with us and diana's hey hey man oh
[34:41] we gotta thank you for your time thank
[34:44] you very thank you
