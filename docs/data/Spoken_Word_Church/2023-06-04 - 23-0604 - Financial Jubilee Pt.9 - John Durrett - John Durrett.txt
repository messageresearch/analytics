========================================

amen but we're starting by the grace of the Lord to continue going on um as I bring it up we're going to continue a little bit more talking about what we started talking about last time talking about conformity and conforming uh-oh let's see if I can brothers let's see if it'll come up thank you I don't know okay well we're probably gonna have to talk about it all right all right well we're going to continue anyway with talking about conformity and um you know just to set the record straight I'm not the credit police we'll leave that to brother Terence he'll be the credit police so that means you are welcome to do whatever you want to do you don't have to apologize you don't have to tell me but um certainly wanting to be a blessing to you and um to let you know that God doesn't want good things you know that's number one God doesn't want you to have bad things and you have to settle for the rest of your life that's not God wants all good things for his people God just has a way and that's what God wants us to have the scripture proverbs 10 22 it says the blessings of the Lord it maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow with it that's a powerful scripture so God wants to bless us you know and that word Rich that can also be enrich but it's literally the word Rich if you run it back Abraham when he told the king of Sodom he said hey I don't want to take anything from you because you're going to say that you have made me Rich it's the same word you have enriched my life you can say that so God wants to bless our lives but he wants to do it in a certain way amen so let's go and go to the Lord in prayer precious Lord we thank you for bringing us here this morning Father we pray you just come down bless your people this morning Father we are so thankful for your word Lord and all your blessings that you have for your children father we pray you be with us Lord this service as we started as we open it up Lord just prepare our hearts Lord Jesus for more of your word Lord Jesus help us to see it in reality father we love you father and we commit this service a Sunday school into your hands in Jesus name amen amen so Conformity we know Romans 12 2 it says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen think about it be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed so that's what we're here to do trying to transform your mind trying to transform it by Renewing Your Mind to the things of God in our day-to-day mundane spending saving buying working getting money we spend most of our hours doing this and we have to renew our minds because the world is set to conform us and um we had a great Sunday uh Bible Study last night for those who missed it was really good brother Wade brought out a forehead and that that really stood out to me you know what it was saying that that whole thing is saying where sin becomes so common to us that we're not afraid to broadcast it we're not afraid to show it off we know the internet you can see any and everything all the time you know no one's ashamed of it anymore just don't call yourself a Christian doesn't mean anything anymore you can wear what you want to wear do whatever you want to do so that's what Conformity is all about you know and that's what the devil wants us to do in all areas of our lives so if we go back to the slide before and it's very simple you know it's a yes and no if I were to show that to a kid and say which one is nice they would always say the smiley face with the yes and the sad face with the no but the member of God is the opposite of this world so when we start seeing God's know as blessings in our lives we're now on the right track he's going to say no to us because he has a provided way so he can't take our way if a good father who's laying out a plan for our lives he has to say tell us no because we don't know what tomorrow holds man think about if we locked in everything when we were teenagers and we said it in and we said this is what we want man I would be ashamed of the things right now that I thought was the best my goodness you know we would think my if I could just get with that girl it would my life would be thank God you know praise the Lord think about it you know if I just had this or if I just had that all my life would be set but God had a plan and that's why we're all here today God orchestrated our lives with yes and no's and all of that to bring this church together today because he has a plan that he's working on and we want his provided way now the devil is always going to be about yes he's always going to try to find a way for you he's never going to tell you no he's going to say there is a way and I can make it easy that's always been his tactic back in the Garden of Eden we know Adam and Eve God said no the devil said hey we can find a way for you we got you and he'll do the same thing today the same thing and money is just a tool to help you see how he works so if you can't afford something he'll find a way make it very easy for you it's always been his trick when God told Cain and Abel toe Kane nope you can't do this he said no I'm going to still do it and then I'm going to get angry if I can't do it and that's the same attitude we'll have we can't get our way we start getting upset and angry so just remember God is saying no because he has a provided way that is so much better if we can learn to wait on the Lord go to the next slide so confirm Brothers go to the next conform it means with or together means basically to adopt the form of those around you Conformity can be defined as the act of matching attitudes and beliefs and behaviors to group Norms Conformity can occur due to a variety of factors including the desire for approval or acceptance a need for social harmony and we've got to fit in or a perceived lack of personal knowledge or certainty about a particular issue you may just not know and you're just going with the flow and so the picture on the side if you can tell what it is it's three of the same elements in different forms one is water one is ice and the other is steam so we know water is going to go with the flow and that's what the world wants don't want us to make a scene just go with the flow go with it why why disrupt why do it differently just go along with it then he wants to freeze you in that as ice so you're locked into that for the rest of your life you're going with something he sets you in and now you're stuck however if we can get heated with the Lord then we'll become steam We rise above all of this and that's what God wants us to do to rise above it so we can see him by the grace of the Lord Jesus see I was as I told you my testimony coming up you know I was used to thinking like a slave we grew up extremely poor so you know all around us was just chaos and we we thought like a slave sometimes I started making a little money I thought well I have to get everything I got to get it now can't wait you know you know God set me up and he told me no to my business idea and all the plans that I had and that transformed my life helped me to renew my mind and that's what I'm trying to encourage you just in a small area so as we go to the bigger things that God has your mind can be renewed God has blessings for each and every one of us that's beyond what we can even imagine but we have to be able to manage that we have to be able to manage these things that God has for us and without the character there is simply no way and remember he's going to say no if we can't handle he's not like us we might give in you know we might say well okay I feel so sorry for him look at his face I'm just gonna go ahead and give in you know I know he blew all his money but I'm going to give him that loan I'm gonna go on co-sign God is not like that he's like if you can't handle I am not going to give it to you and you will go your entire journey and die in the same way that's how serious he is because he wants you to manage it well he wants to bless us so when God told me no he certainly set me up for a miracle and a blessing so as we repeat don't conform to the words the world's way of saying yes to everything if you can wait on the Lord you'll see him come on the scene next slide as I shared the testimony of my dad and God saying no and a lot of things I know from the lessons that I learned in life through all of this this helped us navigate the difficult situation with my dad difficult situation had to get out of the house that he was in but it was many ways that we could have said yes so I want to make sure that point is clear we live in the world today where you can find a way that's the you got to understand that you see this is very different we can make a way today okay you can push yourself you can make it happen and compromise on what God wants for you I could say well you know what we'll just put look I'm tired of this stress we're just going to borrow we're just gonna buy we're just gonna do not give God an opportunity to say no so as we were looking at things we of course we didn't know so we would put a contract on a house but instead of going all out to make sure it happened we said okay let's let's give God a little room here if God wants this now he's we're going to wait on him to see what he's going to do so we're going to put it in maybe slightly lower but still a good deal and then we'll wait on God now but let's instead we can say that we're going to go so take that same approach with anything that you have now if you said I can make it happen without giving God an opportunity to give you a yes or no then you're going to prevent God from coming on the scene right all right so we said no no no we allowed God to do that and by God's grace he opened a door for my dad that was a blessing and a miracle beyond what we can even imagine or think and we thank God today but we had to walk through those no's slowly slowly you're tired yes wanting to make it happen wanting to do something and make it but no we just waited on God and we saw him come through and brother Branham says but you see what it is it's God in his Mercy providing sometimes a thing gets real low where we wonder how it's going to be but God has already provided he just holds it up here drawing interest on it you see to give it to you that is nothing but the truth he holds it waiting until for that right time allowing if you're going to allow it to get real low can you trust him can you trust him to allow it to get real low all right now right before he said this quote now this message is God has a provided way let's go to the next before this quote it's exactly what we're talking about he said I'm going to read through this he said I looked at my old Pontiac the other day it was getting all beat up the high dramatic is going out on it and I got two little girls that bounces around a whole lot in the seats and they about broke the seats down out of it and I went and had it prepared and the man said Billy I'll tell you what I'll do I said I'll give you a good swap for that I said how can I swap that I said I can't do it he said well your credit's good around here as long as you want it I'll hold your note I said That's mighty nice but I can't do it said I'll give you a real good deal on it said being a preacher I'll give it to you at wholesale I said that's nice but see I I can't do it see and said well if you ever take a notion to swap let me know and said all all right next slide so then I thought well God um this old thing is ripe is all right for me it's fine and dandy that in my old truck now you may not know what he's doing but he's renewing his mind he's pausing and thinking wait a second you know my good truck is you know my car it's good it's fine for me you know I said we beat around over the country with it it's okay been doing all these years I can continue on you know I don't have to do this and the other night a phone call came from California he said on the 31st of the month there will be one of the biggest Cadillacs that's made will be brought and set at your door for service to you I said no no brother please said don't do it I said don't I said my neighbors wouldn't understand that and people I don't need a Cadillac I said take the difference and give it somebody else if you want to help me give me a Ford all right or a Chevy I said he said no this is already bought and it's setting here I don't know what I'll do with it that's what brother Brenham said the next slide and this is when he said but you see what it is God in his Mercy providing now that's a natural thing but look what this Prophet is showing us he sat there renewed his mind instead of compromising and God came on the scene and blessed him now that's natural blessed him and that's what it is we have to allow it to sometimes get low so God can come on the scene the devil is going to find a way for that dryer that washer that refrigerator he's gonna find a way that you can get around it you see but we're not going to give God a chance so we can build our faith in the things of God to see wow God you will come on the scene if I could just hold out I can hold out by your grace and do what it takes because God is holding it he is so we see from The Prophet's example how he sat there he resisted he renewed his mind value in that old car you know what it could still go on it's still here you know what am I doing it for anyway and that's what God wants us to do just to think now if you can afford it there's nothing wrong with that but still think do I want it am I ready is it the right time thank God I didn't get a brand new car when my kids were little all those chips and pretzels and candy and all that stuff would have been around thank God my goodness you see so there's a season that might be right you know but even in that we want to just give God an opportunity to work give him he knows what the future holds for us so give him that opportunity resist be thankful renew your mind wait on God God has a provided way but watch those tools that he used he renewed his mind he started being thankful gratefulness is a powerful tool grateful and so that's what we got to watch what Satan is trying to do in this day and time let's go to the next slide back to this quote there's just always dear to my heart for all of us to keep this in mind clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man get all things right get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember name of the Lord something is fixing to happen cleaning up our lives so yes paying your death but also cleaning our lives up thinking getting organized where it's slow enough to where we do have peace peace in our life peace in our homes and what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting as a lodge it's Christ can't come into the church it's perfectly right he's waiting on us I believe we're at the end we truly know that we're here at the end God is waiting on us to get ourselves together and it's going to be us building through all of these things and getting the character from the smallest mundane as brother Louise brought out things in our life getting that character through those things that we're working through so we can handle these bigger things but we are being told we're being told through the word of God we're having this word share to us we know Brother Sam if you saw that um on WhatsApp that you know said his business is something positive for us that's right it's all about growth and for those who've been here years by God's grace I even know the church has gone through financial peace I believe with Dave Ramsey so what is God trying to do he's trying to give us good things by God's grace so it has a church body we can be an encouragement to each other in the right way to encourage Us in the right things so I want you to know as for me in my house this is what we're doing we're fighting this fight by the grace of the Lord Jesus yes we get tempted like everybody else we want to do things we want nicer things but I've learned to wait on God take it slow slow down just a little bit because God wants to bless us above what we can ask or think go to the next slide and God set out from the beginning that's been his plan if we could follow him he'd know so much better than we know and he laid out for Israel they were coming out of this land as immigrants as as a body of people coming into a new country you know pilgrims and strangers that's what they were supposed to be and they were coming into this land and God was laying out that I will bless you abundantly if you obey me if you don't there's nothing but cursings and laying at the door because you don't know the way you're going to do it to yourself if you don't follow what I'm telling you to be obedient to my word that's what God says and the Lord opened up unto thee and the Lord shall if you be if you obey so open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain into thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thy hand and thou shall lend under many nations and thou shall not borrow and the Lord shall make Thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shall not be beneath if that thou hearken unto the Commandments of the Lord thy God which I command thee this day to observe and to do things if you can obey the Lord will do this in your life in all things it is his word he set aside to make his people separate and different to see the blessings of God to get such a handle on these natural things that we can see God you see we start knowing that money can't solve all my problems so it becomes a smaller thing that we're managing and we become like Abraham who was very very rich but that didn't mean anything to him you know even he knew money couldn't buy his son a wife so he said Lord take Eliezer down here look he didn't he didn't think of it in that way it was just a tool to help him to be a blessing that's all it was for Abraham that's what it was and that's what God wants us it's the same thing in our lives or where we can manage this thing show the character of Christ and the small things and take that same model just like a map and model it into the greater things the true Riches of God but we have to be able to follow God and we know what happened to Israel they slowly slowly the next chapters in this verse next verses in this chapter he talks about of course all of the cursings and he laid it out and now they said looking into that Kingdom you thought they thought they would drift apart and lose everything that God had for them no they didn't do it and it happened slowly what happened they started losing gratitude right they started looking around looking what everybody else was doing and they lost that renewing of their minds that thankfulness like hey you know what we are chosen people we're special people to begin with the Unseen I don't need to be exactly like the world to consider myself blessed by God I can thank the Lord for choosing me for calling me for giving me a wonderful wife to all of these things that are unseen instead of counting my blessings with the things that are seen but they kept looking around they had a king this nation's doing this and they wanted to be like everybody else they wanted to conformed and then slowly they did it until they completely drifted away and that's the same thing Bible study the horse forehead slowly drift away our eyes is on everything you got the internet just blasting away to conform us we can't be satisfied with anything the more you look at it the more you will be unsatisfied we're sheep my brothers and sisters we will follow it's very difficult had a young brother he posted a picture he's a young married brother and he posted a picture he got his wife I think a new vehicle and he said what do you do for people you love I said mine well praise the Lord if he got it now I'm not creepy if saved and he got it but I would love for him to put that on there hey I also saved and I paid cash for this then I'd be like Amen brother thank the Lord but if not then what that's going to do to the other young couple that's like honey do you love me you know he does this for the thing people he love you know I don't know anymore right and that thing starts deteriorating you see what I'm saying so we have to all be careful what we're looking at we're just sheep we're gonna go with the flow and start conforming and that's the devil's tactics right if it wasn't an enemy we wouldn't have to worry about it but there's an enemy so he's going to say all this yes to allow you to slowly conform what is this sister doing in her house what is this brother doing in what is it oh my goodness and we start just going along with it instead of taking God's word and conforming to this and being transformed and have our minds renewed so gratitude again they started losing that gratitude because of the Conformity stop being satisfied with what God was providing when God was providing it and slowly lost lost that renewing of their minds so God wants to renew our minds he wants us to be thankful I was reading something as we kind of narrowed down just to show the power the power of God's word and what he's trying to do with renewing our minds and bless his people things that they can do that God wants to give us go to the next slide so these are several Brands and I I asked you know look at it Baskin Robbins it's Ben and Jerry's it's Google Facebook Haagen-Dazs Snapple Starbucks Dale uh DreamWorks I mean all of these companies and now they have something very similar in common you may say what what is in common with these companies outside of them certainly wanted to take my money as well but they definitely do that but it's something in common with it and number one the number one thing that's in common these were all started by Jewish people all started by Jewish people now you say well what am I interested what makes the Jewish people so successful well they have some principles they have principles you know and that's what I want any young person oh God has principles in this word that he wants to bless you beyond what you can imagine but the devil wants to take all of that from us so we can't see God at work we go with the way of the world instead of God building this character in us until we see these gifts and these blessings in our lives that we can then manage so Jewish people we know the history persecuted all through this but they still maintain some of that character like immigrants and you know immigrants we know they say hey they got an edge so I'm just going to share some tips with you about immigrants Edge because we should be pilgrims and strangers we have tools that God has given us in his word that should allow us to be different to overcome many of these obstacles next slide we're going to run through as we wrap up so pilgrims and strangers immigrant Edge there's actually a book out about this you know what make these immigrants that come over and they're able to just kind of outwork Americans you know and I work around the world you know God has given me that opportunity to work with people around the world and I see it I you can barely sometimes get Americans to show up at work to show up and if they show up it's like hey reward me to the max you know I came you know what I mean I only left 30 minutes early you know it's like but you go around different places that they're not taking it for granted my goodness they'll work all night literally literally for a quarter of what someone here is getting paid for so what is this Edge and we're pilgrims and strangers so take this with you to renew your mind start getting that gratitude back in your life number one they're hungry and open to learning good things so always hungry being open to learn we come here by God's grace a great teaching Ministry it's so much to learn take it in be hungry open to it praise God for the variety that God brings to this church it's such a blessing hungry open to learn number two a do whatever it takes mindset willing to sacrifice get out of the comfort zone do whatever it takes so the same thing if you need to wait on Lord do whatever it takes if I gotta you know wash the dishes our dishwasher's broke but I'm gonna get I am going to get her one so she's been washing the dishes like we need you know and I tried to fix it once I'm gonna do it one more time I think I could get it but do whatever it takes my mindset try a willingness to outwork others a willingness to keep going keep working keep doing a heartfelt Spirit of gratitude thank God and focus on what you have not what you lack take that time pause you start a prophet think about well I got a car I got a truck hey I can continue on to be thankful for what you have that Spirit of gratitude is so powerful and remember the devil is trying to take that from us by seeing everything else he gradually steals it right out of our hearts so keep that Spirit hone your skills invest in yourself your job and others hone your skill if you're studying something if you have a job God give you Talent give you still work on it get better at it that's a gift that God has given you hone it number six a commitment to delay gratification that is powerful learning to wait waiting on God waiting on him he will reward you in the right season in the right time and you will be glad for it if you learn to wait and number seven an appreciation of where you came from amen remember where God has brought us from my brothers and sisters we are should be such great for people that God has revealed to us this powerful word he's given us skills and talents to bless our lives he's enriching our lives by his grace and where we came from my goodness where would we have been my mama if God didn't intervene and come on the scene so keep that appreciation last Slide the musicians can come on up and the word I just want to run through some scriptures real quick on gratitude Ephesians 5 20 giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ first Thessalonians 5 18 in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you Philippians 4 6 7 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be known unto God Psalms 95 2 let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise unto him with the Psalms amen Psalms 92 as we get ready for this word it is a good thing praise God to give thanks unto the Lord praise him thank him this morning my God praise you Lord Jesus thank you Father and to sing praises unto thy name O most high God God bless you hey let's renew our minds let's come enjoy the presence of the Lord this morning and be blessed in Jesus name amen [Applause] foreign thank you [Music] foreign [Music] thank you thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign thank you thank you [Music]
