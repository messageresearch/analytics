[4:38] alive it's not dead it's not letter it's
[4:41] not just words
[4:42] father but it has power and spirit lord
[4:45] and you said that it divides us under

[4:54] these people have never heard me we have
[4:56] a promise lord that you are our shepherd

[5:35] as brother uh wade introduced me and
[5:38] brother matt watkins from beaufort south
[5:39] carolina never had an opportunity to be
[5:42] here so you've never heard me speak
[5:43] sometimes that's a little bit
[5:44] uncomfortable for me and for you
[5:48] sometimes you get a new preacher i know
[5:49] how it is they've never heard him they
[5:51] don't know him so you spend half the
[5:53] service wondering worrying thinking
[5:56] so i just want you just to ask the lord
[5:58] lord help the minister
[6:00] and help me to receive god amen

[10:29] i don't know what what kind of life
[10:30] y'all are living but i live a life of a
[10:31] lot of storms a lot of troubles a lot of
[10:34] heartaches
[10:35] times of joy times of victory but man
[10:37] sometimes the the going gets rough
[10:40] and there has to be an unseen arm that
[10:42] holds us through some of the battles we
[10:43] go through we have to say lord all we
[10:45] can do is lean upon you
[10:48] lean upon the everlasting arms of jesus
[10:50] and look to the unseen amen
[10:53] if you have your bibles turn to the book
[10:55] of numbers
[10:56] chapter 33
[11:02] numbers chapter 33 i'd like to look at a
[11:05] thought
[11:07] here tonight i
[11:11] just praying and waiting on the lord to
[11:12] give me direction
[11:14] for this service i believe that there
[11:16] are many many many good things that you
[11:19] could preach
[11:20] only because the word that we draw from
[11:22] is a deep well
[11:24] that's very rich full of good things
[11:26] good things we could say
[11:28] good things we could preach on good
[11:30] things you might amen say my that was
[11:32] good man brother matt he really said
[11:33] some good things but it's not what we're
[11:35] looking for tonight
[11:37] i've said it before and i'm not ashamed
[11:39] to say it i didn't come to impress
[11:40] anybody tonight
[11:42] i came to impress the lord jesus amen
[11:45] and i just want to say something solomon
[11:47] said that a a word in due season what
[11:49] value can you put on that word and so i
[11:52] just want to say something tonight that
[11:53] would help you and encourage you and
[11:56] just to encourage you and your walk with
[11:57] the lord i i'd like to minister on a
[12:00] thought here identifying the revival
[12:03] identifying the revival we'll look here
[12:05] at numbers chapter 33 and we'll begin
[12:08] looking in the 51st verse
[12:10] just to give you a little background so
[12:12] we don't have to cover too much time
[12:14] this is after the children of israel
[12:15] have came out of egypt
[12:17] and they've come out of egypt into a
[12:19] land which god would show them and
[12:21] they've came through many different
[12:22] things and so much has transpired
[12:25] up until this moment that we're reading
[12:27] about here in verse 51
[12:30] they come to the river of jordan on this
[12:33] side of jericho and and everything that
[12:36] they had came out for and everything
[12:38] that god had purposed in his mind here
[12:40] they come to the very climax of the
[12:43] reason of why god had brought them out
[12:45] of egypt he did not bring them out of
[12:48] egypt which is a type of the world just
[12:50] to bring them out he didn't bring them
[12:52] out just so that they could wonder just
[12:54] so that they could be bit by fiery
[12:56] serpents and watch this person die and
[12:58] watch phineas come in with the spear all
[13:00] these things that had happened
[13:02] god didn't bring him out for that
[13:03] purpose but he brought him out in his
[13:05] mind this was the reason that we're
[13:07] about to read it this was this was the
[13:10] climax the reason the purpose the mind
[13:14] of god for the entire purpose of why
[13:16] there was an egypt coming out it was to
[13:19] go into what god had promised them and
[13:22] it was their inheritance
[13:24] and god tells moses he says in verse 51
[13:27] speaking to the children of israel and
[13:28] say unto them
[13:30] when you're past over jordan
[13:32] into the land of canaan then you shall
[13:35] drive out how many
[13:38] the inhabitants of the land now listen
[13:40] to what he says from before you
[13:43] and destroy all their pictures and
[13:45] destroy all their molten images and
[13:48] quite pluck down all their high places
[13:50] and you shall dispossess the inhabitants
[13:53] of the land comma
[13:56] and dwell therein so there is a proper
[13:59] order that god wants this to be done by
[14:02] it would be a mistake for them to go
[14:04] over and to dwell and then dispossess
[14:07] right
[14:07] god did not want them to go over and
[14:09] build houses farms put their kids in
[14:11] school get their economy set up and then
[14:13] say hey hit tight jebusite uh i need you
[14:16] to leave because this is my property
[14:18] but god was gonna have a divine order
[14:20] that he would have them do this he
[14:22] didn't say go dwell but he said first
[14:25] you have to take a sword in your hand
[14:27] and drive out the enemies that are on
[14:30] your property
[14:31] and then dwell
[14:33] and he says here in verse 53 you shall
[14:35] dispossess the inhabitants of the land
[14:37] and dwell therein now so you notice the
[14:39] colon there here's a promise of god
[14:41] here's the promise
[14:43] for
[14:44] i
[14:45] have given you the land to possess it
[14:48] now here is a promise that they can bake
[14:51] their faith upon they could build a
[14:53] foundation upon this one fact that god
[14:56] promised i've given you this property
[14:59] this is not the hittites though they
[15:01] have houses though they have farms
[15:03] though it looks like there's a
[15:04] civilization here actually they're
[15:06] squatters this is your property right
[15:09] and so god tells them i've promised it
[15:12] it's not an if it's not a maybe i
[15:14] promise he says for i have given you the
[15:17] land to possess it
[15:19] verse 54 you shall divide the land by
[15:21] lot for an inheritance among your
[15:23] families and to the more you shall give
[15:25] the more inheritance and to the fewer
[15:26] you shall give the less inheritance look
[15:28] at verse 55
[15:32] but
[15:33] if you will not drive out the
[15:35] inhabitants of the land from before you
[15:38] it's okay i'll wink at it it's no big
[15:40] deal
[15:42] but god why is there a butt i mean i
[15:44] thought this was a promise i i thought
[15:46] you promised you've given it to me so
[15:48] what's what does it really matter what i
[15:50] do
[15:51] you see this was a law of appropriation
[15:54] and we have to be so careful sometimes
[15:56] that we don't mix up things that are
[15:58] unconditional with things that are
[16:00] conditional
[16:01] you see your salvation your your eternal
[16:04] destination if you're sealed into christ
[16:07] is sealed there's no chance that you
[16:09] cannot be an eternity
[16:12] but there's something called the rapture
[16:16] amen of a church
[16:18] what is it i don't know about you but
[16:20] it's my inheritance
[16:22] it's my land it's my property
[16:25] and god tells them this he says but
[16:27] if you will not drive out the
[16:29] inhabitants of the land from before you
[16:33] then it shall come to pass so here's a
[16:36] second promise
[16:37] that those which you let remain of them
[16:40] shall be pricks in your eyes
[16:43] and thorns in your sides and shall vex
[16:46] you in the land wherein you dwell
[16:48] moreover it shall come to pass that i
[16:51] shall do unto you as i thought to do
[16:53] unto them
[16:54] amen
[16:56] judges chapter one one more scripture
[16:58] before you're seated
[17:04] judges chapter one
[17:06] so
[17:07] we find very clear in scripture and i
[17:09] want you to follow this close tonight
[17:12] they have a prophet right
[17:14] they have
[17:16] a promise
[17:17] and they have instructions
[17:20] a prophet promise and instructions
[17:24] what more could they have right right
[17:26] amen
[17:27] and god gives them the order the
[17:30] instructions and a promise and now it's
[17:32] up to them you see this was very
[17:35] different and this is what i what i
[17:36] would like to get to we'll read this
[17:38] first and i'll have you be seated i
[17:39] don't like to preach to you while you're
[17:41] standing
[17:42] uh verse 21
[17:45] the children of benjamin
[17:46] did not drive out the jebusites that
[17:48] inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites
[17:51] dwell with the children of benjamin and
[17:52] jerusalem unto this day verse 27
[17:55] neither did manasseh drive out the
[17:57] inhabitants of beth sheen and her towns
[17:59] nortanik and her towns will skip the
[18:01] towns because there's a lot of them
[18:03] verse 29 neither did ephraim drive out
[18:05] the canaanites that will engage her but
[18:07] the canaanites will engage her among
[18:08] them verse 30 neither did zebulon drive
[18:12] out the inhabitants of catron or the
[18:13] inhabitants of the nahal but the
[18:14] canaanites dwell among them 31 neither
[18:17] did asher 33 neither did nep to lie
[18:20] and it goes on and on and on and on you
[18:22] have to ask yourself the question
[18:25] what happened
[18:29] and anytime you read this passage in
[18:31] numbers and and if you follow the story
[18:33] of the exodus and you think in your mind
[18:35] how many things god had done and brought
[18:37] them from so much and they come to the
[18:39] very climax
[18:41] the very purpose
[18:43] the very thing they had raised their
[18:44] kids in the message for
[18:46] the very reason why they were in the
[18:48] truth
[18:51] and they come up to time to where
[18:53] it's possession time and you look at
[18:55] verse one of chapter two the angel of
[18:56] the lord came up from gilgal to boca
[18:59] and said now listen to this order
[19:02] i made you to go up out of egypt
[19:05] and i had brought you into the land
[19:07] which i swore into your fathers
[19:09] and i said
[19:10] i will never break my covenant with you
[19:12] and you shall make no league with the
[19:14] inhabitants of this land
[19:16] you shall throw down their altars
[19:18] but you have not obeyed my voice
[19:22] god asked him this question why have you
[19:24] done this why don't we pray and watch
[19:26] the lord for the blessing if you have a
[19:28] special need maybe you can just raise it
[19:30] before the lord and say god here's my
[19:32] cup
[19:33] come and fill it tonight
[19:34] heavenly father
[19:36] we're so glad lord that we can say that
[19:40] not out of form not out of tradition
[19:43] but out of a living reality
[19:45] heavenly father
[19:47] for god truly you've shed your love
[19:49] abroad in our hearts you've given us a
[19:51] thirst and a hunger for your word you've
[19:54] cleaned us from sin and there's so much
[19:56] god that we have that we can be thankful
[19:58] for tonight just the fact that we could
[20:00] come and gather
[20:02] under the revealed word of this day and
[20:04] that you have a pastor here who preaches
[20:06] the uncompromised gospel and you have
[20:08] people lord that pull and love the lord
[20:11] and are striving for a rapture what a
[20:13] blessed church we are today god
[20:16] lord and we're in need of you today
[20:18] we're in need of not the word of man
[20:20] lord we're in need god that lord
[20:23] as as your prophet had told us lord that
[20:26] these people that are here tonight
[20:28] they operate the gift that's in the
[20:30] ministry
[20:32] lord let them understand that they
[20:34] literally control the potential of this
[20:36] service on this wednesday night what
[20:38] will it be god that'll be up to them
[20:41] that'll be up to us on how much liberty
[20:43] we give you to move tonight lord i just
[20:46] want to raise my hands and want to say i
[20:48] surrender may these people raise their
[20:50] hands and just say i surrender god i lay
[20:53] any premonition any ulterior thoughts or
[20:56] any sleepiness or tiredness or plans for
[20:58] tomorrow i lay them down god and i say
[21:01] this is your time heavenly father we
[21:03] give you liberty we give you freedom
[21:06] lord i pray god that you would come and
[21:08] do the impossible tonight god
[21:10] may you come and move by your spirit
[21:12] lord we ask in jesus christ's name
[21:15] amen
[21:16] you could have your seats tonight
[21:25] so without going into too much detail of
[21:27] this
[21:28] what we're looking at because i want to
[21:30] make sure we stay on the main focus of
[21:32] this stall
[21:33] and i'd like to just look at this here
[21:35] identifying the revival and you see here
[21:37] in in the book of exodus and throughout
[21:40] numbers and you find this this events
[21:42] the the the exodus out of egypt and here
[21:45] god had been doing and i want you just
[21:47] to notice
[21:49] a few things god had been doing so much
[21:52] for the children of israel they come out
[21:54] of egypt and god tells them here in
[21:55] judges chapter two he says i made you to
[21:59] go out of egypt he doesn't say you did
[22:01] anything he doesn't say you wanted to
[22:03] necessarily that you did love your own
[22:04] accord but he says i made you come out
[22:07] of egypt i hardened pharaoh's heart and
[22:10] they they learned this god of doing
[22:12] everything for the my they got a prophet
[22:14] before him and and the red seas are
[22:17] opening up and man is falling from
[22:18] heaven he feeds on me clothes to me
[22:21] dresses them he gives them quail in the
[22:23] morning and so many things are happening
[22:25] and god's just moving and they're
[22:26] learning this god that just does
[22:28] everything for them and he fights their
[22:30] battles and they don't really have to do
[22:32] anything and all they really ever do is
[22:34] complain anyways
[22:36] and here they come up to the climax and
[22:38] god is done and done and done and done
[22:40] and did for them and did for them and
[22:41] did for and here they come to the very
[22:44] river of jordan and here's the climax
[22:46] and they say my this is what was sworn
[22:48] unto my father abraham this is what was
[22:50] sworn unto my fathers there would be a
[22:53] promise of this there would be a promise
[22:54] of a rapture of the church and there
[22:56] would be a people who put on immortality
[22:59] and a church that wouldn't have spot or
[23:00] wrinkle and everything that has been
[23:02] promised everything we've been waiting
[23:05] for what we've staked our lives for and
[23:07] grown our families and built our
[23:08] churches upon and here comes the very
[23:11] moment of truth for the children of
[23:13] israel and god turns on them in a way
[23:15] and says look
[23:17] i've done for you this far but now it's
[23:21] time to put action to your face
[23:24] and if you want canaan you got to go get
[23:27] it
[23:28] because there's a genusite who has
[23:30] children who has families who have homes
[23:32] and who has weapons and you've got to
[23:33] take your faith and the sword of the
[23:35] word and go and cut his head off right
[23:38] amen
[23:39] and so you see that come over in egypt
[23:41] and and my so many things happen and we
[23:44] could identify the revival that started
[23:47] right at the coming out of egypt and my
[23:49] revival fire is so so so so so awesome
[23:52] among them and miracles are taking place
[23:55] and you look at this revival if you
[23:57] study just the revival of them and then
[23:59] how it comes to the very moment and
[24:01] right you're right when you think that
[24:03] so much potential for them to to take
[24:06] the promises of god and they come to the
[24:08] very moment and this is what happens
[24:10] they go over and they don't get complete
[24:12] victory manasseh and ephraim doesn't
[24:14] drive out the k he drives out the
[24:16] inhabitants of the mountain but he
[24:18] couldn't get victory in the valley
[24:19] because they had ontario and manasseh
[24:21] couldn't do this and ephraim couldn't do
[24:23] this and you're thinking how in the
[24:25] world does this happen to a promise
[24:27] elect but refer to a promised group of
[24:30] people who have instructions clear-cut
[24:32] instructions they have a promise they
[24:34] have
[24:35] they have a prophet to tell them what to
[24:37] do how to live how you're to operate
[24:39] when you get over there and they come to
[24:40] this very moment and they squander their
[24:43] opportunities
[24:46] and the revival that started and looks
[24:48] so good ends in death
[24:51] you see the bible tells us and god god
[24:53] we don't have to pick it up here in
[24:54] judges chapter two but if you keep
[24:56] reading the bible says that
[24:58] god made this promise if you don't drive
[25:01] out the inhabitants of the land from
[25:03] before you then it shall come to pass
[25:05] that those which you let remain in your
[25:08] life will become pricks in your eyes
[25:11] thorns in your side and shall vex you in
[25:14] that land now it never affects ephraim
[25:17] personally it never affects manasseh
[25:19] personally or any of them personally but
[25:22] who does it affect
[25:24] the generation
[25:25] that rises
[25:27] because the bible says ephraim and ass
[25:29] and the rest of them are buried with
[25:31] their fathers but the bible tells us in
[25:33] judges chapter 2
[25:34] it says also that generation gathered
[25:37] unto their fathers and there arose
[25:38] another generation after them which knew
[25:41] not the lord
[25:42] nor yet the works which he had done for
[25:44] israel and the children of israel did
[25:46] evil on the side of the lord and served
[25:48] balaam
[25:49] they forsook now this is easy for us to
[25:52] read friends
[25:53] it's really easy for us to look at our
[25:55] studying oh my that's terrible but these
[25:57] were message kids
[26:01] these were moms and dads who hadn't my
[26:03] mom's had long hair dads who didn't
[26:05] smoke and didn't drink and went to
[26:07] church
[26:08] this was real families
[26:10] and here was their children who they had
[26:13] raised thought they had raised correctly
[26:15] but because of incomplete victory in mom
[26:18] and dad's life
[26:20] the bible says the children of israel
[26:21] did evil inside of the lord and served
[26:23] balaam they forsook
[26:25] the lord god of their fathers it didn't
[26:28] say they forsook gods
[26:31] they didn't say they stopped being
[26:32] religious oh they kept going to church
[26:34] but they served balaam yeah
[26:36] sure and he says and which brought them
[26:38] out of the land of egypt and followed
[26:39] other gods or the gods of the people
[26:41] that were round about them and bowed
[26:43] themselves unto them and provoked the
[26:45] lord to anger and the lord fors and they
[26:47] forsook the lord and served bella and
[26:49] astra
[26:50] now this is this is so amazing and we
[26:52] got we got to take a hard corner here
[26:54] and i pray that you'll just follow me in
[26:56] this
[26:57] to lay a little bit of groundwork but we
[26:59] see that this was the revival of egypt
[27:02] the revival i'm sorry of the children of
[27:03] israel and we see how it what we watch
[27:06] it and it starts out good and the
[27:07] revival time comes around and it comes
[27:09] to the very climax like we've said and
[27:12] then it ends and it dies that raises up
[27:14] a generation and then judges reign over
[27:16] israel and we know what comes through
[27:18] back through in jeremiah and the
[27:20] different prophets but i'd like to just
[27:22] look at this brother branham says
[27:24] that he found a keystone
[27:26] in the bible
[27:28] oh yeah and he said that it's the
[27:30] revelation that god never changes
[27:34] his ways are as unchangeable as he is
[27:38] right brother branham said that was the
[27:40] keystone that unlocked the bible
[27:44] we know what a keystone is in an arch if
[27:45] you don't have the top keystone the
[27:47] interaction fall apart right brother
[27:49] branham said it was this that jesus
[27:52] christ
[27:53] is the same
[27:55] yesterday amen today and forever
[27:58] solomon says i know that whatsoever god
[28:01] doeth it shall be forever nothing can be
[28:04] put to it nor anything taken from it and
[28:07] he says that which has been is now and
[28:10] that which is to be has already been and
[28:13] god requireth that which is passed
[28:16] brother branham takes those two
[28:17] scriptures out of out of the book of
[28:19] hebrews in the book of ecclesiastes and
[28:21] he says this is the keystone that
[28:23] unlocks the bible right that god does
[28:27] not change amen
[28:30] have we heard that too much
[28:32] you see we live in a very changing world
[28:35] we live in a world that constantly
[28:36] morphs constantly grows constantly
[28:39] changes things get worse times get worse
[28:42] times get harder word gets more wicked
[28:44] but god doesn't change that's right
[28:47] and then you see here brother adam says
[28:49] in the ephesian church age here it is
[28:52] and i'm changing god with unchanging
[28:55] ways now listen to this what he did at
[28:57] the first
[28:58] he will have to keep on doing until this
[29:00] last time
[29:02] there will never
[29:04] be
[29:05] a change
[29:08] what god did in the first
[29:11] church age
[29:12] is what he wants to do
[29:15] in all other ages
[29:18] now we don't want us we don't i know i
[29:19] know you're very well taught here we
[29:21] don't need to go down and look at it
[29:23] very close but we all know what the
[29:24] first church age was right we all know
[29:27] what the first church was brother
[29:29] branham said it was a seed and we know
[29:30] that it was brother type there's the the
[29:32] bride tree in other places these types
[29:34] that is the wheat plant the seed that
[29:36] goes into the ground it dies but it
[29:38] brings back fourth seven church ages
[29:40] it's restored through messengers until
[29:43] you come to the very last age and god
[29:45] would bring forth the seed a
[29:47] continuation of the seed that goes in
[29:49] the ground but the seed that comes out
[29:51] at the top would have to look the same
[29:53] act the same be not the same or to be a
[29:56] continuation of what went in the ground
[29:58] right
[29:59] and brother branham says here it is and
[30:01] then changing god there will never be a
[30:03] change what god did in the first church
[30:05] age is what he wants to do in all other
[30:07] ages we know exactly from the word which
[30:10] was recorded by the holy spirit how the
[30:12] first
[30:13] or original church
[30:16] was founded now we're going to deal a
[30:17] lot with this ephesian church age i want
[30:19] you to look at how significant the first
[30:22] was heard a man say the other brother
[30:24] say the other day that god made he said
[30:27] i want to get this correct until he says
[30:29] that he said when god made his first
[30:31] church
[30:32] when god created it and built his first
[30:35] church he made it how he wanted it and
[30:37] now he wants his last church to be how
[30:39] his first church was
[30:42] and brother branham says he knows the
[30:44] word can't change or be changed because
[30:46] it's the word of god thus
[30:49] now listen
[30:50] what the church was
[30:53] at pentecost
[30:55] is the standard
[30:57] that is the pattern there is no other
[31:00] pattern no matter what scholars say god
[31:03] has not changed that pattern now don't
[31:06] think azusa street 1906 that's not
[31:09] pentecost pentecost was what happened on
[31:11] the day of pentecost in the book of acts
[31:14] when an ephesian church
[31:17] is that right amen
[31:19] that is the standard that is the pattern
[31:22] what god did at pentecost he has to keep
[31:26] on doing until they close
[31:27] those scholars may tell you that the
[31:29] apostolic age is over don't believe it
[31:34] as long as men are being called and sent
[31:37] forth with the word of life there's an
[31:38] apostolic age going on now listen
[31:42] secondly they referred to an age and he
[31:44] puts this in quotes manifested
[31:47] holy ghost power
[31:50] as being over since the bible has been
[31:52] completed brother branham gives a very
[31:55] simple answer that is untrue right amen
[32:01] we're in a message church why would you
[32:02] feel the need to preach that well
[32:04] friends i think you would be surprised i
[32:06] preached to the church here not too long
[32:08] ago had no clue get outside and find out
[32:11] by the pastor the church believes that
[32:13] there is no such thing this is a message
[32:15] church there is no such thing as the
[32:16] holy ghost baptism communion foot
[32:19] washing we are in the bride age now
[32:21] there is no more church ages they have
[32:23] been closed we don't receive the holy
[32:25] ghost like they did in the book of acts
[32:27] it is totally different you're born with
[32:28] a seed
[32:30] come on brother
[32:32] now you know why a prophet would say
[32:34] though they tell you the apostolic age
[32:37] is over don't believe it
[32:39] amen that is not true he says then peter
[32:42] said unto them repent be baptized in the
[32:44] name of jesus christ for the remission
[32:46] of sins for the promise
[32:48] of power i love how brother brandon says
[32:50] this of which with the apostles were
[32:53] endued with at pentecost is to you the
[32:57] jews your children the jews to them that
[33:00] are afar off
[33:01] us the gentiles
[33:03] until he stops calling the pentecostal
[33:07] message and power will not cease can i
[33:10] get an amen time
[33:12] what the church had i love that it means
[33:14] possessed at pentecost is her
[33:17] inalienable right originally she had the
[33:20] pure word of god she had the power of
[33:22] the spirit manifested in diverse signs
[33:25] and wonders and gifts of the holy ghost
[33:28] let me tell you something friends this
[33:30] is not just ink on paper this is your
[33:33] inheritance in the holy ghost
[33:35] this is my promise your promise if
[33:37] you're a child of god tonight this is
[33:40] your canaan this is your land don't let
[33:42] a devil keep you from
[33:45] the power of the spirit of god
[33:47] manifested in the church
[33:49] is the oxygen to the church
[33:52] and when we lose the power of the spirit
[33:54] we've choked the church
[33:57] what is the devil attacking let me get
[33:59] to this real real quick what is the
[34:01] devil attacking in our day
[34:03] today is he attacking how theological
[34:05] our ministers are how much we know the
[34:07] message is he attacking how well we
[34:10] preach or teach or how much we wave our
[34:12] hands and yell no friends he's attacking
[34:15] the power of the spirit moving and
[34:17] having freedom in your life what is the
[34:20] devil going to attack in this church
[34:22] brother branham said the end the book of
[34:24] revelation identifies how the antichrist
[34:27] spirit would come into the church
[34:29] defiling it making it lukewarm formal
[34:32] gold
[34:36] where is the onslaught of the devil in
[34:38] our churches today
[34:40] destroying the oxygen to the church
[34:44] amen and he says what the church had at
[34:47] pentecost is her inalienable right amen
[34:51] originally she had the power of god in
[34:53] the power of the spirit manifested in
[34:54] diverse signs and wonders and gifts of
[34:56] the holy ghost
[34:58] the original church was not organized by
[35:00] men it was led by the holy ghost
[35:03] wasn't very big it was hated and
[35:04] despised it was oppressed it was
[35:06] persecuted unto death but it was true to
[35:10] god
[35:11] it stayed with the original
[35:14] word
[35:16] what does that tell me friends that
[35:18] tells me that you are not part of you
[35:20] say i'm a message believer what does
[35:22] that mean it does not mean that you are
[35:24] part of a movement that started in 1947
[35:28] and ended in 1965 you're not part of a
[35:31] uh
[35:32] some kind of club or some kind of
[35:34] movement but you're part of the very
[35:36] book of acts church the book of acts the
[35:39] church of god the pentecostal church
[35:41] that started in the bible in the book of
[35:44] acts that is that my roots can trace all
[35:46] the way back to there i'm part of that
[35:49] family of god that's why we sing i am
[35:51] one of them
[35:53] exactly i'm a believer are you believers
[35:55] tonight
[35:58] that is what the church had it stayed
[36:00] with the original true church the true
[36:02] church are we the true church tonight
[36:04] we'll always try to be like the original
[36:06] at pentecost the true church would today
[36:09] will try to approximate that early
[36:12] first one right now
[36:15] so we see how important it was how much
[36:19] how much significance was put on all the
[36:21] ages and all the churches but
[36:23] specifically to the first and to the
[36:25] last the alpha and the omega the seed
[36:28] that goes into the ground and dies and
[36:29] the seed that's harvested and the
[36:31] combine picks it up and raptures the
[36:33] church there's a lot of importance there
[36:35] but i'd like you just to look here for a
[36:37] minute and i'm going to slow down
[36:39] but i'd like you just to look here for a
[36:41] minute at that ephesian church if there
[36:43] was so much importance to their revival
[36:45] and what took place and what happened
[36:47] and how brother branham said that was
[36:48] the first pattern that was the standard
[36:51] if a church claims to be a true church
[36:53] they will have to come to their portion
[36:54] in every age of that pattern
[36:57] and we know that martin couldn't come to
[36:59] it luther john wesley couldn't they
[37:00] could come to a portion of it still
[37:02] believing in the trinity still smoking a
[37:04] pipe but if they came to their portion
[37:06] of the pattern for their day they were
[37:08] identified as true church
[37:11] but today we don't just have a portion
[37:13] and measure we have the fullness the
[37:14] restoration of the bride tree
[37:17] but we see here in the ephesian church
[37:19] age now listen to this
[37:22] is the pattern
[37:23] this is the standard
[37:28] and let's look at their revival
[37:29] nevertheless
[37:31] i have somewhat
[37:33] against
[37:34] me
[37:36] because
[37:38] thou
[37:39] has
[37:41] left now notice it doesn't say
[37:44] thou has lost right
[37:46] but it says thou
[37:49] has left
[37:51] god didn't go anywhere
[37:53] but thou has left thy first love
[37:57] to understand this brother branham says
[37:59] you must realize now just pitch your
[38:01] attention tonight i apologize i have
[38:02] quotes a lot of them to read i know
[38:04] sometimes in this this age of video and
[38:07] everything's channel has to be
[38:09] tantalizing and entertaining if you go
[38:10] to read a quote people go to sleep on
[38:12] you so just hold your attention here
[38:14] tonight i'm going to read a few of them
[38:15] just listen close to the words you
[38:17] believe their life don't you
[38:19] i don't understand this you must realize
[38:21] brother adam says
[38:22] the spirit is not speaking to the
[38:24] original saints of ephesus alone now
[38:25] listen to what brother branham says some
[38:27] of these key words
[38:29] history
[38:31] keeps
[38:32] repeating itself
[38:34] just think of that in your mind
[38:36] history
[38:38] keeps repeating
[38:40] right in the generation of israel
[38:43] we see a revival and one generation only
[38:46] to see the fires fading in the next and
[38:49] in the third generation embers may be
[38:51] glowing slightly but in the fourth there
[38:54] may be no vestige whatsoever of the
[38:55] original flame right
[38:58] now that's what we read about in the
[38:59] book of numbers the first generation
[39:02] comes out of egypt fire is burning
[39:04] second generation comes on embers may be
[39:06] glowing slightly then by the third and
[39:08] fourth there's no vestige they forsook
[39:10] god they pursue the god of their fathers
[39:12] they're serving other gods
[39:15] brother brandon says that history if you
[39:17] look in the bible we don't want to go
[39:19] through every single one my friends you
[39:20] could go through every single one of the
[39:22] revivals the revival that started the
[39:24] eden
[39:24] it ended and started in life and then
[39:26] death starts with seth the children of
[39:29] seth ends in nimrod power of bible and
[39:31] you look at all these things the revival
[39:33] starts in life ends in death starts in
[39:35] life ends in death the ephesian church
[39:38] age
[39:39] brother branham says history keeps
[39:40] repeating itself
[39:43] he says
[39:44] and then he says then in the fourth
[39:46] generation there may be no vestige
[39:48] whatsoever of the original flame and
[39:50] then
[39:52] god lights the fire right again
[39:55] and the same process
[39:58] is repeated right
[40:00] it is simply the manifestation
[40:03] god has no grandchildren amen
[40:07] salvation is not passed by a natural
[40:10] birth
[40:11] it isn't in the word he says you start
[40:14] out
[40:15] with a truly born again believer
[40:18] truly born again sealed by the holy
[40:20] ghost
[40:22] and he says that when the next
[40:23] generation comes along they're not just
[40:25] christians born again christians but now
[40:28] they've taken a denominational name
[40:30] their baptist methodist that's exactly
[40:32] what they are they're not christians you
[40:34] have to be born of the will of god not
[40:36] the will of man to be saved
[40:39] what does brother brandon say history
[40:40] keeps repeating itself in one generation
[40:42] we see revival here only to see the
[40:44] fires fading in the next and the
[40:46] neighbors may be glowing slightly and
[40:48] then god lights the fire again it lights
[40:50] up it goes dimmer dimmer dimmer dies he
[40:52] likes it again the same process and
[40:53] brother random stops and says what is it
[40:56] it's simply this manifestation god has
[41:00] no grandchildren
[41:02] let that sink in believers god has no
[41:06] grandchildren it does not save your
[41:08] children to be a message church or a
[41:10] message home or to have a picture of
[41:12] brother adam in your house there is no
[41:14] grandchildren
[41:18] what is that telling us revival is not
[41:21] sustained
[41:22] within
[41:24] the revival right
[41:26] just because there was a revival does
[41:29] not inherit or give you this truth that
[41:32] every generation that comes up and grows
[41:34] in that revival will take will be enough
[41:37] will be part of the same revival listen
[41:39] to me friends unless the generations
[41:41] that keep going on as time goes on come
[41:44] to the same fiery baptism experience
[41:47] that started your revival they will die
[41:51] unless our children come to the same
[41:53] holy ghost not a different holy ghost
[41:55] not a different way not a different kind
[41:57] of osmosis where we just listen and we
[41:59] believe and we're slowly assimilate and
[42:01] assimilate the word and if we get them
[42:03] around enough church and get them to
[42:05] preachers and get them to pastor listen
[42:07] friends we must have the fire the
[42:09] baptism of the holy ghost in our homes
[42:12] and our children in our churches
[42:15] that is what is necessary for this
[42:17] revival to continue
[42:19] amen because just message message church
[42:22] message turn profit god sent a prophet
[42:24] third pull those things will not sustain
[42:26] your kids
[42:30] amen
[42:31] brother branham says
[42:34] these are not christians
[42:36] you have to be born of the will of god
[42:37] not the will of man
[42:39] to be saved but these folks are coming
[42:42] together now brother branham says and he
[42:45] begins to look at the ephesian church
[42:46] age
[42:48] they're not
[42:49] the same
[42:51] anymore
[42:53] right
[42:54] what happened
[42:55] we got our pattern we get our standard
[42:58] happen in ephesus something powerful
[43:00] happened in the book of acts what do you
[43:01] mean something happened god what would
[43:03] you have against that church
[43:05] they're not the same anymore right yeah
[43:09] he says
[43:11] the first
[43:12] desire
[43:14] to please god
[43:17] i want these just to sink in
[43:20] the fervent
[43:22] desire
[43:23] to please
[43:24] god the passion
[43:27] to know his word
[43:30] the cry
[43:31] for reaching out in the spirit
[43:34] begins to fade
[43:36] and instead of that church being on fire
[43:39] with the fire of god
[43:41] it's cooled off
[43:42] and became formal
[43:46] that is what was happening
[43:48] to these ephesians
[43:50] they were getting formal what the
[43:52] pattern the standard no no no he is that
[43:55] wrong that was the smurf it wasn't the
[43:57] ephesian church yet surely not
[44:01] no the pattern the standard what god did
[44:03] in the first church he has to keep on
[44:05] doing that same church
[44:07] that started in the book of acts
[44:09] eventually became the
[44:12] of the book of revelation amen and jesus
[44:15] said the kingdom of heaven is liken unto
[44:17] a mustard seed brother adam picks it up
[44:20] and said it was the mustard seed church
[44:22] sprouts forth instantly adds numbers
[44:24] overnight but brother branham said it
[44:26] only walked in purity for such a little
[44:28] short time
[44:29] and eventually becomes the tree
[44:32] of every fowl and clean and hateful
[44:34] about it
[44:36] what happened to their revival
[44:39] right and he says
[44:41] they were getting formal
[44:44] he says
[44:45] that second generation the abandonment
[44:47] of god was dying out and the people
[44:48] weren't too careful about what god
[44:49] thought of them as they begin to be
[44:51] careful about what the world thought
[44:54] and that second generation
[44:56] coming on
[44:57] was just like
[45:00] israel
[45:03] they demanded a king
[45:06] to be like other nations
[45:09] and when they did that
[45:12] they
[45:12] rejected god
[45:15] amen listen to me
[45:17] when they did many things wrong
[45:20] but when they demanded a king brother
[45:23] branham said they rejected god right
[45:25] there
[45:27] listen to me friends i hope this is okay
[45:29] to preach here tonight
[45:30] but in the message you see it came out
[45:33] in the infancy
[45:34] so many people were caught up in the
[45:37] truth of the doctrines and the truth of
[45:39] a revelation of a message and god
[45:41] sending a prophet but what happened to
[45:43] so many people's homes you watched
[45:45] people crown ministries and pastors and
[45:48] personalities and they were chasing
[45:50] charisma and big churches and they
[45:52] uprooted families and homes and moved
[45:54] here and moved there all white chasing a
[45:56] king
[45:57] how did the men do this no but the
[46:00] people crowned kings in the message
[46:04] and they chased after men and big names
[46:06] and big preachers and big personalities
[46:09] and i'm all for respecting the men of
[46:10] god but listen to me church anytime you
[46:13] bank your children's souls and your
[46:16] marriage and your home and you say i'm
[46:18] just gonna go to a pastor and he's
[46:20] obligated to fix my children fix my
[46:22] marriage if my children don't get the
[46:24] holy ghost then it's his
[46:27] listen to me friend it was never the job
[46:30] of a pastor to save your kids or to save
[46:32] your marriage or your finances it must
[46:35] be moms and dads and homes that say we
[46:37] will be baptized with the holy ghost we
[46:40] will seek the holy ghost for our
[46:41] children amen right and the ministry is
[46:43] only there to assist you and to edify
[46:46] you as a body
[46:47] but you must have your church at home
[46:50] right right now
[46:51] what happened to church at home
[46:54] what happened to worship at whom
[46:57] when children the message the only
[46:59] worship they see is at church
[47:01] what is wrong with that
[47:04] children of israel god of all the feasts
[47:06] that they had god only required that
[47:07] they kept three all three feasts god
[47:09] required were not done at church
[47:12] but at home
[47:16] and now we see families
[47:18] there's no church at home there's no
[47:20] sanctification at home
[47:22] right
[47:23] and it's all just gather around the
[47:25] pulpit
[47:26] and we'll change there and that's why
[47:28] when you have problems in your home than
[47:30] in your kids who do you blame
[47:33] the pastor
[47:35] oh yeah my two churches bling and you
[47:38] watch people uproot families and crown
[47:40] kings and personalities and they pray
[47:43] for me preach for me study for me do
[47:45] everything for me pastor
[47:47] because i've moved here and you watch
[47:48] people and they move to these churches
[47:50] and they put so much confidence in that
[47:52] man when that man did what was normal
[47:55] for a man and that is to make mistakes
[47:59] they left the man
[48:01] and they chased other men and other men
[48:02] and then finally when they've ran out of
[48:04] kings they
[48:08] amen and brother branham says when they
[48:10] did that they
[48:12] rejected god right that's right
[48:17] but they did it anyway
[48:19] that
[48:20] is
[48:22] the history
[48:24] of the church
[48:26] oh no that's oh well that's their
[48:28] history that's not our history no this
[48:30] is your history
[48:31] that is the history of the family of god
[48:34] history keeps repeating itself
[48:38] when it thinks more of conforming to the
[48:40] world instead of conforming to god it
[48:42] isn't long until you see them now listen
[48:44] to what happens because i'm preaching to
[48:46] you tonight on identifying the revival
[48:49] and we see revival starts out in ephesus
[48:51] starts out so good slowly time goes on
[48:53] and it begins to die now what are some
[48:56] of the things we're to look for brother
[48:58] branham if you're going to explain to us
[49:00] how history keeps repeating itself and
[49:02] processes being repeated what are some
[49:04] of the things we look for to know when
[49:06] these things are taking place brother
[49:08] branham says
[49:10] it isn't long until you see them stop
[49:13] doing things they used to do amen
[49:18] and they start doing things they
[49:21] wouldn't do
[49:22] initially
[49:25] they stop
[49:26] doing things
[49:28] that they used to do
[49:30] and they bring things into homes that
[49:33] they originally kicked out
[49:37] and they bring things into worship that
[49:39] they would have never done initially but
[49:41] somehow since time has gone on god's
[49:44] standards lower as time gets darker
[49:46] amen
[49:48] but you see that's not god
[49:50] though time goes longer and though the
[49:52] age gets darker god doesn't change
[50:00] those kind of things you know you sort
[50:01] of got it you sort of got to be careful
[50:02] brother matt because the age is so dark
[50:04] and if you if you try to preach that old
[50:06] hole in his standard like we used to boy
[50:07] you'll just kick you or run everybody
[50:08] out of the church don't you know all age
[50:10] now dark the ages yeah i know how dark
[50:12] the age is but i know how powerful my
[50:14] god is and i know how much the blood of
[50:16] jesus christ can do to an individual
[50:18] because he changed my entire life
[50:22] and if he can do it for me ten years ago
[50:24] he can do it for any young person old
[50:26] person middle-aged person he's the same
[50:29] yesterday today and forever
[50:32] brother branham says
[50:34] they change they stop doing things that
[50:37] they used to do and they start doing
[50:39] things they wouldn't do
[50:41] initially
[50:43] they change
[50:45] their manner
[50:47] of dress
[50:50] i better duck when i'm preaching these
[50:51] things here now i'll just preach it from
[50:53] down here okay
[50:58] he says they changed their manner of
[51:00] dress now listen
[51:02] their attitudes
[51:04] and
[51:06] their
[51:07] behavior yeah
[51:08] right now brother branham now hold on a
[51:11] minute
[51:12] you're going to tell us what it looks
[51:13] like when a revival is dying
[51:15] surely brother vernon you mean to say
[51:17] that they're preachers they they get
[51:19] dumb they get dumber right they're not
[51:21] preaching as powerful and their theology
[51:24] slips and they forget certain things and
[51:26] we don't have money anymore in the bank
[51:27] account those are the things that that
[51:29] that you can tell that a revival is
[51:31] dying right brother branham no
[51:34] they change their manner
[51:37] of dress now friends this is his words
[51:38] not my words
[51:40] they change their manner of dress
[51:44] their attitudes and their behavior
[51:50] now we could spend three sermons on
[51:53] dress attitude and behavior
[51:56] we're not going to tonight because this
[51:57] is a wednesday night we got to get you
[51:58] out of here early but brother branham
[52:00] says they change their manner
[52:03] of dress
[52:05] and friend i don't have to spend too
[52:07] much time preaching for you to realize
[52:09] that's changing
[52:12] in the message
[52:15] used to be you used to be able to spot a
[52:17] sister from a mile away in walmart
[52:22] he says no that's a believer their
[52:23] holiness pentecostal or they're a
[52:25] believer one or the other you go talk to
[52:26] him where you go to church all these
[52:28] that and the other but now you can't
[52:29] tell our sister's hardly apart from a
[52:31] hippie
[52:34] and our brothers and our sisters and my
[52:36] the way we dress he said brother matt
[52:38] why is that important isn't just
[52:39] important that we love god well it's it
[52:42] really doesn't matter what i think is
[52:44] important or what you think but it's
[52:46] what god thinks
[52:49] and he says they changed their manner of
[52:52] dress you see used to there was a
[52:54] reality in the church
[52:57] used to our sisters didn't
[52:59] cut their hair because it was a
[53:01] revelation to their soul not a form that
[53:04] they lived by
[53:07] that's why now we've defined trimming is
[53:10] different from cutting
[53:14] now it's amazing how we can do these
[53:16] sort of kind of things when webster
[53:17] himself would laugh at us
[53:21] since when is trimming
[53:23] not cutting
[53:25] and i've said this before what if i was
[53:26] to take a rope here tonight i was going
[53:28] to hang it down to be 10 inches long and
[53:30] i was to cut it halfway you'd say you
[53:33] cut it
[53:35] what did i do to it did i cut it yet you
[53:37] cut it but what if i was just to take
[53:38] that rope and i was only to cut just a
[53:41] 16th of an inch
[53:43] did i cut it you'd say yeah you cut it
[53:50] it seems pretty simple to me i don't
[53:52] know about you
[53:54] what was the reason do we say these
[53:55] things to beat people up or to hit them
[53:58] on that no that's not why we say them we
[54:00] say them to let our sisters know this
[54:02] was what god looked at when moses seen
[54:06] the pattern and god said build it
[54:08] exactly as you see that pattern this is
[54:11] what i wanted bride to look like this is
[54:13] how i want a bride to live this is
[54:15] what's in my heart and the wife becomes
[54:17] the expression of what's in the
[54:19] husband's mind
[54:21] amen
[54:23] and brother branham says they changed
[54:24] their manner of dress it used to be that
[54:26] our brothers didn't wear shorts
[54:29] and it didn't matter if they were in
[54:30] hawaii on vacation either
[54:37] oh my
[54:39] but you look at all these kind of things
[54:40] and we could preach on a hundred of them
[54:42] but what is the point brother matt that
[54:44] you look at these signs brother branham
[54:46] said this is when you know
[54:48] death
[54:50] is in the revival
[54:52] corruption
[54:53] has set in
[54:55] we could preach all night on the revival
[54:57] of a nation the revile of an age of our
[54:59] loving church
[55:02] but let's preach on the revival of me
[55:07] let's identify our revival
[55:11] they change their manner of dress
[55:14] their
[55:15] attitudes
[55:17] see brother branham says this the right
[55:19] mental attitude towards any promise of
[55:21] god will bring it to pass
[55:24] so when we see promises not coming to
[55:26] pass in our church we know our attitudes
[55:30] must be wrong
[55:32] we live in a generation a nation you
[55:34] just take this nation for example we
[55:36] live in a nation that can be defined as
[55:38] this they do not want correction
[55:42] you live in a world that hates
[55:44] correction hates dignities hates
[55:46] authority we live in a society where
[55:48] young people walk around they have no
[55:50] respect for the owner they have no
[55:51] respect for authority and just a brother
[55:54] and call it total parent delinquency
[55:57] and you live in a nation that doesn't
[55:59] want to be corrected but it comes into
[56:01] the church now it's less and less
[56:02] popular for a person to get up a
[56:04] minister to bring the gospel and preach
[56:06] a corrective sermon without people
[56:08] folding their arms getting up and
[56:09] walking out
[56:12] brother branham said
[56:14] he said their attitudes changed the
[56:16] bible says the son that receiveth not
[56:18] correction is a bastard
[56:20] child
[56:22] i say
[56:23] receiving correction what does that mean
[56:26] israel is not is receiving correction
[56:28] brother matt when we say a man to
[56:30] corrective preaching or we say that's
[56:32] the truth or we agree with it no friend
[56:34] you're no different than the person who
[56:37] folds his arms and walks out
[56:40] receiving correction is not agreeing
[56:42] when the correction comes when you
[56:45] receive correction is when your life can
[56:47] be corrected by the word
[56:50] it's when you change
[56:54] that's the child who receives correction
[56:57] is the child who the word of god can
[56:59] correct their thinking can correct their
[57:01] way i say god correct my thinking if
[57:04] it's wrong correct my life if it's going
[57:07] in the wrong direction correct my home
[57:09] correct my family lord i want to be
[57:12] recorrected not to say gee dad you're
[57:14] right that's right i agree with that but
[57:16] to say god change me from the inside
[57:19] make me a new creation change my desire
[57:22] dear god
[57:23] that's a child who receives correction
[57:26] but the writing says in their behavior
[57:28] they get lacks that is what ephesus
[57:30] means
[57:31] relaxed and drifting
[57:35] and listen to this next sentence
[57:37] that
[57:38] cycle of revival and death
[57:42] has never failed right right
[57:46] history keeps repeating itself
[57:49] that cycle of revival and then death
[57:53] is never found
[57:55] all you have to do is recall this last
[57:57] move of god when men and women went to
[57:59] church dressed like christians
[58:02] prayed
[58:03] all
[58:04] night
[58:05] ouch
[58:06] prayed all night
[58:09] took the street corners
[58:12] they were not ashamed of the
[58:14] manifestation of the spirit they left
[58:16] their old dead churches they worshipped
[58:18] in homes and store buildings but they
[58:20] had
[58:21] reality
[58:24] i say god send the reality back if
[58:26] that's what we lost give me reality
[58:28] again say like david i thirst not a for
[58:32] a dead god but i thirst for the living
[58:34] god and he says they had reality but it
[58:38] wasn't too long a time until they began
[58:39] to read books that weren't fit to read
[58:41] they put in the choir instead of singing
[58:43] unto god for themselves they let down
[58:45] the bars and the goats came in and took
[58:47] over yeah right the cry of joy was gone
[58:51] the freedom of the spirit was gone
[58:54] all they kept on with the form
[58:57] but the fire had died
[59:00] right the blackness of ashes is about
[59:02] all that was left ephesus
[59:05] you did run well right right what
[59:07] hindered you
[59:09] but the brandon says history tells us
[59:10] that eventually there was not one
[59:13] christian left
[59:15] just a small squalid village of
[59:17] unbelievers
[59:19] the pattern
[59:21] the standard
[59:24] the original church
[59:26] what happened
[59:28] to you and your revival it looks so
[59:31] great it looks so promising so much
[59:33] potential but what took place
[59:36] and your revival ephesus
[59:39] brother branham comes here
[59:41] 1957.
[59:43] but you read him before that 1946 49 and
[59:46] 1950 christ the killer the kinsmen
[59:49] redeemer he comes to the end of services
[59:51] pentecost this is it we have what it
[59:54] takes for a rapture praise god
[59:56] hallelujah tape goes off and you hear
[59:58] that over and over and over but then he
[1:00:00] comes later on in time you see brother
[1:00:02] branham was born and he comes in the
[1:00:04] middle of a pentecostal azusa street
[1:00:08] revival
[1:00:10] it was not the restoration of pentecost
[1:00:14] and brother branham begins to think this
[1:00:17] is it
[1:00:18] this is the long-awaited restoration
[1:00:21] but then brother adam comes now listen
[1:00:23] to this
[1:00:24] to the seven church ages
[1:00:27] i'm gonna sit you people down
[1:00:29] in these other churches listen to me
[1:00:32] you're in a lukewarm age
[1:00:35] you're evangelists are crossing the
[1:00:36] earth preaching things like that you
[1:00:39] get nowhere
[1:00:43] you're hollering you baptist or
[1:00:45] hollering a million more in 44 but what
[1:00:47] if you got when you got them just a
[1:00:49] bunch of sinners come in and put their
[1:00:51] names on a book say they belong to a
[1:00:53] baptist church not only that but you
[1:00:55] have methodist candlelights the whole
[1:00:56] group just as formal and indifferent
[1:00:59] billy graham told me that he had 30 000
[1:01:02] converts and in six weeks he couldn't
[1:01:04] find 30.
[1:01:07] why brother brandon says why is that
[1:01:11] because they never got anything to start
[1:01:13] with
[1:01:16] they were just a bunch of sinners
[1:01:19] when they put their name on a book
[1:01:22] under
[1:01:24] under
[1:01:26] the spell
[1:01:27] of a revival
[1:01:30] right
[1:01:31] mine when i saw i read that about shook
[1:01:32] me to death
[1:01:34] under the spell come to the altar repent
[1:01:37] of your sins repeat after me
[1:01:39] christ died for my sins
[1:01:41] my works are filthy right and they
[1:01:43] repeat this prayer and brother branham
[1:01:46] said what were they under a trance
[1:01:49] under a spell not of a witch doctor not
[1:01:52] of witchcraft but of a real revival
[1:01:56] under the spell
[1:01:58] of a revival you see friends our message
[1:02:01] brought a spell
[1:02:03] when god brings something great and a
[1:02:05] revival strikes the earth it brings a
[1:02:08] spell and what did you have people doing
[1:02:10] following on the words of a man 1977 i
[1:02:13] don't see how it could go past that and
[1:02:15] they were in a trance they were in a
[1:02:17] spell and they believed and followed
[1:02:19] that spell until 1977 the spell broke
[1:02:23] and where are they today
[1:02:26] they never got anything to start with
[1:02:32] and he says this is heavenly i want you
[1:02:35] to listen
[1:02:37] queen of sheba listen to what brother
[1:02:39] adam says
[1:02:40] it's been very strange in our homelands
[1:02:44] to see brother branham says it certainly
[1:02:47] has alarmed my emotions
[1:02:50] to see
[1:02:52] of the coldness
[1:02:54] and the indifference that the church is
[1:02:56] becoming
[1:02:58] a few years ago and brother adam goes
[1:03:00] back in his memory a few years ago we
[1:03:02] had a meeting
[1:03:04] tinsel was all over the meeting and
[1:03:06] people gathered to places where the
[1:03:07] newspaper had a report of people driving
[1:03:09] as many as 3 000 miles by a taxi cab
[1:03:14] just to be in the presence
[1:03:16] of the outpouring of the spirit oh yeah
[1:03:20] people drove 3 000 miles in a taxicab
[1:03:25] right
[1:03:26] to be in the presence of god right right
[1:03:30] and brother branham says
[1:03:32] and tonight
[1:03:34] 1957 queen of sheba tonight
[1:03:37] after much advertisement trying to
[1:03:40] cooperate with everybody showing the
[1:03:42] same spirit that we did when we first
[1:03:44] came
[1:03:45] yet it's hard to get a little group of
[1:03:47] people to smeal to fill a little small
[1:03:49] arena like this
[1:03:51] then you could wonder why a minister's
[1:03:53] heart is alarmed
[1:03:56] yeah tommy osborne told me my ministry
[1:03:59] if i come in tokyo this coming summer
[1:04:01] he'd expected at least two or three
[1:04:03] million converts
[1:04:05] the ministry the lord has given me
[1:04:07] seemed like it went over the head of the
[1:04:08] educated people but in the lands where
[1:04:11] they believe that god is real you see
[1:04:14] here in america we accept him with a
[1:04:16] mental conception but they over there
[1:04:18] have a reality and when they see it that
[1:04:21] settles it and tens of thousands swung
[1:04:23] to christ in one article
[1:04:27] and the same message
[1:04:28] with the same effort that we put forth
[1:04:31] and maybe 200 people
[1:04:34] or 300
[1:04:36] whatever would be here tonight
[1:04:38] or maybe five or six people might come
[1:04:42] to christ
[1:04:43] where the same effort
[1:04:46] across the sea would bring a hundred
[1:04:48] thousand to christ right
[1:04:51] notice what he starts seeing a few years
[1:04:53] ago what's happened you see what
[1:04:55] happened was revival cycle was good it
[1:04:58] looked good pentecost was it my people
[1:05:01] were driving everywhere from meetings
[1:05:02] there was such a fire such a zeal such a
[1:05:05] passion there was such a reality and
[1:05:07] then after just a short little time
[1:05:09] brother brandon begins to recall in his
[1:05:10] minute memory what happened to all these
[1:05:12] people he says but tonight
[1:05:14] tonight 200 people where's everybody at
[1:05:19] or maybe five or six people would come
[1:05:22] to christ
[1:05:24] now listen to me friends don't let this
[1:05:26] shock you but here in 2010 in this
[1:05:29] service
[1:05:31] maybe nobody
[1:05:35] not one person
[1:05:37] and brother branham says see
[1:05:40] that's the difference
[1:05:42] the revival
[1:05:44] has left
[1:05:46] our
[1:05:47] country yeah
[1:05:49] we might as well just
[1:05:52] face it
[1:05:55] or maybe
[1:05:56] nobody will come to christ
[1:05:58] brother branham says you watch that
[1:06:00] church stop doing things they used to do
[1:06:02] and they start doing things they didn't
[1:06:03] do initially let me tell you what has
[1:06:06] been lost in the christian message
[1:06:09] church
[1:06:10] the desire and the burden for lost souls
[1:06:15] oh that's just cornbread and milk
[1:06:17] preaching brother matt
[1:06:19] that's just old foul who you know that's
[1:06:21] the you need to get out your seals but
[1:06:22] bruh matt read something deep what's
[1:06:24] happened to the burden of the lost
[1:06:26] friends
[1:06:27] can we not shake ourselves where tonight
[1:06:29] nobody not one sinner is sitting in this
[1:06:32] building our churches used to be grown
[1:06:34] by members by people what was our growth
[1:06:37] based upon years ago by a sinner coming
[1:06:40] to repentance at an altar under the
[1:06:42] conviction of the preached word and
[1:06:44] having his eyes open to the truth
[1:06:47] but tonight where does growth come in
[1:06:48] message churches
[1:06:51] growth is now the family who gets upset
[1:06:53] at the pastor or the deacon's daughter
[1:06:55] and so they uproot their family and they
[1:06:57] move to this other church in this church
[1:06:58] and this family moves to here and
[1:06:59] adhering to here to hear oh we've grown
[1:07:01] our churches grown have we really grown
[1:07:05] oh friends i hope you don't mistake me
[1:07:07] it's just passion tonight
[1:07:09] where is our burden for the loss what
[1:07:11] about the man who doesn't know god the
[1:07:14] woman who needs god we are the arms we
[1:07:16] are the eyes we are the body of christ
[1:07:20] we should have something bodily from
[1:07:22] inside of us to where we're not ashamed
[1:07:24] to tell people of the gospel amen
[1:07:28] where sinners would fill up our churches
[1:07:31] and not just believers who've heard the
[1:07:33] gospel over and over and over
[1:07:38] the revival
[1:07:40] has cooling
[1:07:42] he says we might as well just face it
[1:07:46] it's a pitiful sight but why does this
[1:07:48] happen friend it's because this
[1:07:50] condition has to come
[1:07:53] there's an atomic bomb laying on her to
[1:07:55] settle the difference what do you mean
[1:07:56] brother
[1:07:57] this condition no no no no no wait the
[1:07:59] rapture of the church is at the
[1:08:01] condition of the it's going to be
[1:08:02] greater the condition of the churches
[1:08:04] there's going to be thousands of people
[1:08:05] and we'll be adding members and knocking
[1:08:07] out walls building new churches
[1:08:09] missionary effort everywhere mine there
[1:08:11] will be such a fire everybody will have
[1:08:13] their lives free of sin and there won't
[1:08:14] be anybody falling away and everybody
[1:08:16] will be perfect
[1:08:18] that's the rapture condition right
[1:08:23] no
[1:08:25] this condition
[1:08:26] of coldness
[1:08:28] falling away
[1:08:30] ministers who used to preach the gospel
[1:08:32] fallen into adultery
[1:08:34] pastors falling into homosexuality
[1:08:37] brother matt that yes that
[1:08:42] that shakes me that scares me it
[1:08:43] shouldn't
[1:08:44] it shouldn't scare us it shouldn't worry
[1:08:46] us this condition must come but there's
[1:08:49] a bride who will have the fire of the
[1:08:51] holy ghost who won't get cold and won't
[1:08:54] get turned up but will stand for the
[1:08:56] uncompromised gospel of jesus christ
[1:08:59] and whose lives will be passionate and
[1:09:01] be full of zeal for the hour
[1:09:04] i said god i'm one of them lord glory
[1:09:06] brother says this condition must come
[1:09:10] it's because he says his judgments is
[1:09:12] just the hour there's nothing that will
[1:09:13] stop it all the preaching i can do all
[1:09:16] the resurrection that christ could show
[1:09:18] everything we'll never stop it right
[1:09:21] right amen but here's what we're
[1:09:23] responsible for
[1:09:24] giving a voice against it that it's
[1:09:26] wrong
[1:09:28] he says i could never stop these ladies
[1:09:31] from wearing old vulgar clothes
[1:09:36] you couldn't stop them brother adam
[1:09:40] it's the nature
[1:09:42] of them
[1:09:44] they've already seen it they were the
[1:09:45] devil presented that they were subject
[1:09:47] to it i could never stop men from
[1:09:50] drinking what is brother brandon saying
[1:09:52] friends if a ministry of a prophet to
[1:09:54] this age could not change people's lives
[1:09:57] just by his preaching then brother
[1:09:59] samuels by the way none of us none of
[1:10:01] our ministry can do it unless we have
[1:10:03] willing vessels who can say god change
[1:10:06] me by the preaching of your word unless
[1:10:08] we have people who surrender their lives
[1:10:10] to the ministry
[1:10:12] it's the nature in film when you see a
[1:10:15] person who can never change
[1:10:18] and they come to church and you preach
[1:10:19] to them on their dress and preach them
[1:10:20] on their clothing on their hair and how
[1:10:22] they live and all these kind of things
[1:10:23] and they hear it over and over and over
[1:10:25] and over
[1:10:26] change oh they just need to mature they
[1:10:28] just need to be adopted listen friends
[1:10:30] they need the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:32] they need a birth they need a ceiling
[1:10:35] where all things are passed away behold
[1:10:37] all things become new
[1:10:40] that's what our church needs that's what
[1:10:42] our children needs
[1:10:44] we need to understand as parents if our
[1:10:46] children are sinners they are dead right
[1:10:48] and unless god breathes life into them
[1:10:50] all that all that now all the bringing
[1:10:52] them to church unless they see a token
[1:10:54] life on display a blood that pleads for
[1:10:57] them a mom and dad who stays on their
[1:10:59] knees and prays for them and holds the
[1:11:01] blood banner the uncompromised holiness
[1:11:04] gospel before their lives
[1:11:07] oh god just help us tonight lord amen
[1:11:09] brother branham says
[1:11:11] i can never stop but i can never stop
[1:11:13] men from drinking i could never make the
[1:11:14] church spiritual
[1:11:16] all the preaching i would do would never
[1:11:18] make it spiritual
[1:11:20] but daryl
[1:11:21] oh i love this there will be one
[1:11:24] and that one's a fish god wants him in
[1:11:27] the kingdom i'll give my voice i don't
[1:11:29] know who it is but i'll preach it and as
[1:11:32] i preach he'll hear for all the father
[1:11:35] hath given me will come to me
[1:11:38] oh the father had given will come i'm so
[1:11:41] glad there was a minister who didn't
[1:11:43] stop preaching who continued to plead
[1:11:46] and continue to preach the gospel
[1:11:48] because i was one who heeded the word
[1:11:51] and said being unto me god according to
[1:11:53] your word i said i'm coming again that's
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:56] listen to me friend what happened to
[1:11:58] this revival
[1:12:00] something that started out so good and
[1:12:01] i'm closing just here in a minute
[1:12:04] you look at pentecost they did run well
[1:12:06] it looked so promising my movement was
[1:12:09] happening the holy ghost was moving and
[1:12:11] then it comes to this point what's wrong
[1:12:13] with the church it's alarming my soul i
[1:12:15] see the coldness and the indifference
[1:12:17] the church is becoming more cold it's
[1:12:19] harder to get people to come to church
[1:12:20] period let alone when they get there to
[1:12:23] participate in the service and into
[1:12:25] worship
[1:12:27] then the song leader has to pump them up
[1:12:28] raise your hands close your eyes say a
[1:12:30] prayer and it's not people who are
[1:12:32] inspired themselves
[1:12:35] they depend upon ministers to inspire
[1:12:37] them how backwards is this right from
[1:12:40] when paul said when all come together
[1:12:42] all participate in spiritual worship
[1:12:45] and hymns and
[1:12:48] singings that church
[1:12:52] begins to die
[1:12:54] and brother branham comes to a message
[1:12:56] door to the heart
[1:12:59] 1963
[1:13:02] three services before he preaches the
[1:13:04] opening of the seals
[1:13:07] just before the opening of the seals
[1:13:09] brother brannon comes with this message
[1:13:10] door to the heart and he says you look
[1:13:12] at the coldness you see the indifference
[1:13:14] you see the the coldness that's in the
[1:13:16] church and the holy ghost doesn't move
[1:13:18] anymore brother branham says why what is
[1:13:20] it
[1:13:21] the revival
[1:13:24] is over right
[1:13:26] now you have a prophet messenger
[1:13:28] standing upon the earth and he declares
[1:13:31] to the pentecostal revival the shock
[1:13:34] right it's dead right
[1:13:38] it's over
[1:13:40] and all hope seemed lost
[1:13:42] mine what are we going to do
[1:13:44] it's over it's done with all hope is
[1:13:47] lost
[1:13:48] could this be i'm not sure but could
[1:13:51] could we be preaching now to souls that
[1:13:53] are in prison right
[1:13:55] amen and all hope seem lost and then
[1:13:57] brother branham comes
[1:13:59] little did they know
[1:14:02] that as the day that a revival was
[1:14:04] coming to a close there would be a
[1:14:06] messenger and john the bible says in the
[1:14:09] book of revelation chapter 5 john wept
[1:14:12] because he looked on heaven all under
[1:14:13] heaven and in the earth and nobody was
[1:14:15] found worthy but the elder said to me
[1:14:18] weep not john for the lion of the tribe
[1:14:20] of judah has prevailed and he is worthy
[1:14:24] and brother branham stands in the breach
[1:14:26] and he says maybe it's just me feeling
[1:14:28] this way but let him come and take this
[1:14:30] book or forever hold his peace and
[1:14:32] listen to me friends he came and took
[1:14:35] the book and a revival started again
[1:14:38] amen and there was a new truth and a new
[1:14:40] message and a seed had been restored
[1:14:43] right and the shot pulled away and was
[1:14:45] dead but there was new life again amen
[1:14:47] and that's me and that is that you
[1:14:49] tonight friends is that your revival
[1:14:51] tonight there is a reality to that
[1:14:54] revival that i am a believer of present
[1:14:56] day truman i earnestly contend for the
[1:14:59] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:15:00] saints
[1:15:03] but what's happened
[1:15:07] all right
[1:15:08] brother adam comes to
[1:15:10] recognizing your day and his message
[1:15:12] voice herod of his coming or voice of
[1:15:14] hillary forget which publication he says
[1:15:15] they're saying fast pray fast pray not
[1:15:17] too late for revival yet brother brandon
[1:15:19] says why are they doing that
[1:15:21] they haven't recognized the awakening
[1:15:23] right or the revival
[1:15:26] of
[1:15:26] the bride
[1:15:28] five stars lined up for the venom says
[1:15:30] what is it signify a bride a bride god
[1:15:33] has a church without spot or wrinkle
[1:15:36] jesus said in revelations chapter 3 to
[1:15:39] him that overcometh that means what for
[1:15:41] the man there will be somebody who
[1:15:44] overcomes this world i just want to
[1:15:46] believe that's me god
[1:15:49] when he said to him that overcometh he
[1:15:51] was saying to me
[1:15:52] i'll grant to sit with me on my throne
[1:15:54] as i also overcame and i'm set down with
[1:15:57] my father on his throne
[1:16:01] and that was a reality
[1:16:03] that's why there's a church here in lula
[1:16:06] georgia
[1:16:08] that's why there's a church because
[1:16:10] revival might have died but a new cycle
[1:16:13] i began
[1:16:16] and what happened
[1:16:18] now that you see our revival
[1:16:23] and you see manner of dress changing
[1:16:25] attitudes changing people getting cold
[1:16:27] ministers falling away
[1:16:29] church is falling apart crumbling no one
[1:16:32] can get the victory anymore
[1:16:36] then it comes really close and down to
[1:16:39] home
[1:16:40] oh yeah
[1:16:43] by the random comes i'll close on this
[1:16:45] one point
[1:16:47] brother adam comes to the seventh seal
[1:16:49] and he begins to list
[1:16:51] he begins to list the third pull and he
[1:16:53] says you know there was he says all
[1:16:55] these things happen he says there was
[1:16:57] that little baby shoe
[1:16:58] he says and i was trying to take that
[1:17:00] one inch thread through a little quarter
[1:17:01] inch island and it was saying you can't
[1:17:03] teach pentecostal babies supernatural
[1:17:05] things and there was that fishing pole
[1:17:07] the rainbow trout he said i was sitting
[1:17:09] there throwing it they were saying you
[1:17:10] can do it bill you can do it he said
[1:17:12] that jerk the line and you ever you any
[1:17:14] of you fishermen know if you ever use
[1:17:15] the baitcaster rod and ever you throw it
[1:17:17] too far and you don't get that thumb
[1:17:18] stop in time boy it can backlash on you
[1:17:21] brother branham said it backlashed all
[1:17:22] over where it was like spaghetti and he
[1:17:24] said in that angel that boy stepped in
[1:17:26] front of me and said i told you
[1:17:29] don't get your line tangled in these
[1:17:32] kind of times
[1:17:35] brother adam says then
[1:17:37] he says oh i'm so stupid lord forgive me
[1:17:40] god i'm such a dummy please forgive me
[1:17:42] lord and he says then
[1:17:44] there was that tent
[1:17:47] or auditorium
[1:17:50] or something
[1:17:51] now we're not afraid of this are we
[1:17:52] tonight
[1:17:54] we know what men have made it and what
[1:17:56] theology and what what men probing and
[1:17:58] wondering and speculating has made it
[1:18:02] but he said there was that tent
[1:18:04] or auditorium
[1:18:06] or something
[1:18:09] and he says
[1:18:11] and i
[1:18:12] was called away
[1:18:15] i was looking down you got one big
[1:18:18] problem if you believe in a return
[1:18:20] ministry brother branham says i was
[1:18:23] caught away
[1:18:25] he wasn't even there
[1:18:28] what does that tell me
[1:18:32] that he's seeing something that will
[1:18:34] happen
[1:18:35] after he's gone right
[1:18:38] yeah now let's identify
[1:18:41] our revival
[1:18:43] brother brandon says i'm looking at a
[1:18:46] tent or something and there's people
[1:18:49] gathered everywhere
[1:18:51] and he says all under this great big old
[1:18:53] tent
[1:18:55] and he says and the voice told me
[1:18:57] brother madam says inside this tent
[1:18:59] there was a little wooded room a little
[1:19:02] room made out of wood and brother adam
[1:19:04] says that the angel told me he says this
[1:19:07] is the third pool and he says and i'll
[1:19:09] meet you in there
[1:19:12] and it won't be
[1:19:13] a public show right
[1:19:17] i'll meet you in there and it won't be
[1:19:21] a public
[1:19:23] show
[1:19:25] brother branham says in that light that
[1:19:27] you see there in the picture he says
[1:19:29] that light that you see there in the
[1:19:30] picture left me
[1:19:33] and whirled on down into that little
[1:19:35] room right
[1:19:38] and brother brandon says
[1:19:40] i don't understand
[1:19:42] why that little wooden room
[1:19:47] and he says then the voice told me
[1:19:49] didn't jesus say
[1:19:51] when you pray
[1:19:52] be not like the hypocrite
[1:19:54] who prays openly but enter into your
[1:19:57] secret closet
[1:20:00] enter into your secret room and what
[1:20:02] you've done in secret your father will
[1:20:05] reward you openly
[1:20:07] and brother brendan says ah now i
[1:20:10] understand yes
[1:20:12] you're right
[1:20:13] and brother says his people
[1:20:16] begin to go into this little wooden room
[1:20:19] and he said they'd come out and he said
[1:20:22] and they'd look
[1:20:23] and he said they'd go in with missing
[1:20:24] limbs
[1:20:26] and he said they'd hit her in this
[1:20:27] little wooden room and he said and then
[1:20:30] they'd come out and their their arms
[1:20:32] were restored their missing limbs are
[1:20:33] restored he said someone would say what
[1:20:35] happened what happened to you in there i
[1:20:38] don't know
[1:20:40] i'm not sure
[1:20:41] what took place i don't know
[1:20:43] all i know is
[1:20:45] i was blind but now i see
[1:20:48] i'm missing limbs but i entered that
[1:20:51] little wooden room and now i'm whole
[1:20:53] again now listen to me friends what was
[1:20:56] he identifying the revival what was the
[1:20:59] tip a revival meeting what was happening
[1:21:02] listen to me i hope you don't miss it
[1:21:04] the focus was not what was taking place
[1:21:07] under the tent
[1:21:09] you see the focus in this day is not
[1:21:11] what's taking place in the message tent
[1:21:14] it's not what's taking place behind a
[1:21:15] man behind a pulpit but the focus is in
[1:21:18] a little room a little closet that you
[1:21:21] enter into and victory is one in that
[1:21:23] little room
[1:21:25] where is the revival gonna be friends is
[1:21:27] it gonna be a public show that you can
[1:21:29] look around in my everything looks so
[1:21:31] good no because it doesn't always look
[1:21:32] too good
[1:21:34] right but the revival will be sustained
[1:21:37] in your little wooden right
[1:21:39] right resistance can return tonight
[1:21:43] that little room
[1:21:50] and i want you to notice
[1:21:52] there was no preacher
[1:21:54] say brother man are you preaching we
[1:21:55] don't need a preacher no that's not what
[1:21:56] i'm preaching
[1:21:59] the bible says
[1:22:03] the bible says something like this
[1:22:05] if you didn't last and you couldn't
[1:22:08] survive with the footman
[1:22:11] how will you survive when the calvary
[1:22:14] comes
[1:22:17] listen to me friends we're living
[1:22:20] in the day of
[1:22:21] or hundreds of thousands of thousands of
[1:22:24] demons
[1:22:25] have been released against you
[1:22:30] you not a body not a group listen to me
[1:22:34] friends that's where we get things so
[1:22:35] mixed up
[1:22:36] god is not dealing with the bride as the
[1:22:39] bride yeah brother branham said after
[1:22:41] israel he never dealt with that group
[1:22:43] again
[1:22:44] the bride is not a bride because of a
[1:22:46] group that's gathered under a tent but
[1:22:48] it's the bride by a multi-membered
[1:22:51] individual body what is god dealing with
[1:22:54] not your church not your he's dealing
[1:22:56] with homes with families with
[1:22:58] individuals it doesn't mean that the
[1:23:00] entire church has to be spiritual you
[1:23:02] have to say like joshua as for me and my
[1:23:05] house
[1:23:06] we will serve the lord we refuse to
[1:23:09] compromise we refuse to get cold is that
[1:23:11] your desire tonight we refuse to get
[1:23:14] callous under the callous age that we
[1:23:16] live in we refuse to let our prayer life
[1:23:18] slip right that is my inheritance devon
[1:23:24] maybe a hittite squad on your prayer
[1:23:26] life but take that sword of the spirit
[1:23:28] and go get back what god gave to you
[1:23:31] right you
[1:23:33] won't survive
[1:23:37] keep this warning tonight
[1:23:39] without a prayer life
[1:23:41] you
[1:23:42] won't
[1:23:42] survive
[1:23:44] period right
[1:23:47] oh please hear my words hear the words
[1:23:49] on this side of grace
[1:23:52] on this side of mercy while there's
[1:23:53] still a chance
[1:23:56] without a personal intimate relationship
[1:23:59] with
[1:24:00] christ won't do it maybe it could ten
[1:24:03] years ago maybe you could last off the
[1:24:05] preaching that you get on wednesday on
[1:24:06] saturday sunday whenever you have church
[1:24:10] but we need everything that we can get
[1:24:12] in this age that we live in friends you
[1:24:14] won't make it your kids won't make it
[1:24:15] moms and dads if all you ever do is
[1:24:18] bring them to church tell them a message
[1:24:19] tell them all these kind of things and
[1:24:20] doctrines and theology unless there's a
[1:24:23] living church
[1:24:24] that goes with them on monday on tuesday
[1:24:26] or wednesday and a mom who prays and a
[1:24:28] dad who stays and a dad who's at home
[1:24:31] abiding as a high priest and confronting
[1:24:33] the demon spirits that are anointing and
[1:24:35] attacking his house
[1:24:37] then families won't survive
[1:24:40] right
[1:24:41] stand your feet with me tonight you can
[1:24:42] just
[1:24:43] play something for me
[1:24:45] softly sister
[1:24:48] i begin to think of this
[1:24:50] identifying the revival
[1:24:54] just play real softly for me if you can
[1:24:56] musicians
[1:24:58] i don't want you to think of this
[1:25:00] tonight
[1:25:02] here was a hat here was a room we know
[1:25:05] throughout the entire bible wood
[1:25:08] represents humanity
[1:25:10] throughout the whole bible wood
[1:25:12] represents humanity and brother branham
[1:25:14] says they entered this little secret
[1:25:17] room this little wooden room
[1:25:19] and they had missing limbs
[1:25:22] and he says but as they came on the
[1:25:24] other side
[1:25:25] those limbs were restored right
[1:25:30] and i began to think
[1:25:32] i don't have any missing limbs
[1:25:36] i had all my hands
[1:25:37] feet
[1:25:39] arms toes legs
[1:25:43] and you may say that tonight
[1:25:45] but then i begin to think the lord told
[1:25:48] me but you're part of a body
[1:25:51] the body of christ
[1:25:53] and in your body there's a missing dad a
[1:25:56] missing mom
[1:25:57] a missing son a missing daughter
[1:26:01] the devil would like us to go they're
[1:26:02] lost we'll bury them they're over we'll
[1:26:05] move on but don't accept that devil's
[1:26:07] lie i don't care how lost or how missing
[1:26:10] they see the church that prays the
[1:26:12] church that gets on their knees and
[1:26:14] enters that little wooden room brother
[1:26:16] madam said the missing limbs
[1:26:18] are restored
[1:26:21] you say i have missing loved ones i have
[1:26:23] this problem brother matt they've gone
[1:26:24] so far and mine just seems hopeless
[1:26:27] it's never hopeless with the god that i
[1:26:29] serve
[1:26:31] buy your heads with me tonight if you
[1:26:33] don't mind
[1:26:40] play that song do you know it
[1:26:42] there is a river that flows
[1:26:46] from deep within
[1:26:50] identifying the revival
[1:26:52] as we've said we could
[1:26:54] look at many things tonight on
[1:26:57] revival of a church of an age of the
[1:26:59] message but that really doesn't matter
[1:27:03] what matters is
[1:27:05] my revival
[1:27:11] just let god deal with your heart
[1:27:12] tonight friend
[1:27:15] where is your revival
[1:27:20] where is your home
[1:27:23] what things have you stopped doing that
[1:27:25] you used to do
[1:27:27] and things that you've started doing
[1:27:29] that you
[1:27:30] wouldn't do initially
[1:27:37] brother brennan says this in
[1:27:41] recognizing your dance message
[1:27:45] maybe you can pray this with him
[1:27:47] he begins to come to the end of his
[1:27:49] service and he says oh
[1:27:51] this is heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:27:54] i wouldn't swap this for anything
[1:27:57] you know how i love to fish and love to
[1:27:59] hunt because i see god in the wilderness
[1:28:01] i love it but i wouldn't change one
[1:28:03] minute for this for all the hunting
[1:28:05] experiences i can have
[1:28:07] one minute of this
[1:28:09] from that satisfaction
[1:28:11] god
[1:28:13] listen to this prayer
[1:28:15] create
[1:28:16] in me
[1:28:18] a revival
[1:28:19] all right
[1:28:20] let me be the revival god
[1:28:24] let each one of us be the revival the
[1:28:27] revival
[1:28:28] in me notice not the revival in the
[1:28:31] church or the revival of the message of
[1:28:33] the revival of the bride but just say
[1:28:35] god let it start right here not my
[1:28:38] brother not my sister let the revival
[1:28:41] start right here god
[1:28:45] make me lord he says to hunger make me
[1:28:48] to thirst
[1:28:49] created me lord that what is me which is
[1:28:52] needed in me
[1:28:54] let me be
[1:28:55] from this hour
[1:28:57] more consecrated servant
[1:29:00] a better servant
[1:29:02] more blessed of you
[1:29:04] more able more humbler more kinder more
[1:29:08] willing to work we're looking to the
[1:29:10] things that are positive and forgetting
[1:29:11] those things which are in the past and
[1:29:13] are negative let me press towards the
[1:29:15] mark of the high calling
[1:29:17] that's our desire
[1:29:19] isn't it
[1:29:22] i'd like to just ask you tonight
[1:29:24] honest people nobody looking around
[1:29:27] but if you'd like to say and some hands
[1:29:29] are already up
[1:29:31] do you like that is saved by an uplifted
[1:29:32] hand
[1:29:34] create in me the revival moment
[1:29:36] if my revival has died
[1:29:39] if none go with me it's the whole world
[1:29:42] and the whole cosmos and the whole the
[1:29:45] entire everybody who claims the truth if
[1:29:47] they go south and if they go south on
[1:29:50] god oh lord let me look to the heavens
[1:29:53] let me look to the hills from what's
[1:29:54] come with my help let my fire burn let
[1:29:58] me be that one who you set to kill that
[1:30:00] overcometh will i grant to sit with me
[1:30:03] on my throne
[1:30:06] listen friend there's no promises here
[1:30:08] there's no givens
[1:30:10] you're not gonna make it just by coming
[1:30:12] to this church
[1:30:14] you've came for years your children
[1:30:16] won't make it just by saying amen or
[1:30:17] believing or dressing right or living
[1:30:19] right until you come to that experience
[1:30:23] of the sailing of the holy ghost
[1:30:27] your revival
[1:30:28] will die
[1:30:32] what's it gonna take mom
[1:30:34] what's it gonna take dad
[1:30:38] as those parents had to look at the
[1:30:40] generation who rose up and didn't know
[1:30:43] god
[1:30:44] didn't know the god of their fathers
[1:30:46] they didn't know the god of their of
[1:30:48] light brought them out of egypt
[1:30:50] they didn't know the god of the message
[1:30:54] and they began to serve baal and ashraf
[1:31:01] my
[1:31:03] what's it going to take dad
[1:31:07] is that prick that thorn in your eye
[1:31:09] vexing you
[1:31:11] as you look and you see your children
[1:31:13] battling the same things that you could
[1:31:16] never get victory over
[1:31:19] you know what the devil wants you to do
[1:31:20] give up it's too late you've sown the
[1:31:22] wrong seed it's over but i serve a god
[1:31:25] who's the same yesterday today and
[1:31:27] forever if you're willing to repent if
[1:31:30] you're willing to cut off the world to
[1:31:32] cut off lady asea and hold a standard in
[1:31:35] your home god can multiply the heroes
[1:31:37] that you've lost
[1:31:39] and you just want to raise a hand and
[1:31:41] say help me
[1:31:42] yes lord lord
[1:31:45] god bless the hands that are helpful
[1:31:49] god bless those kids

[1:31:54] different than the tempo but just try to
[1:31:56] follow me if you can't
[1:32:13] from
