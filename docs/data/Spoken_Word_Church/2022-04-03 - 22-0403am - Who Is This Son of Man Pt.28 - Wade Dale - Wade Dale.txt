========================================

my sins is the blood that still cleanses me is the grace that still sets me free [Music] i'm walking in new [Music] greater than [Music] a blessing to be back in the house of the lord again i mean brother talking when they said if the devil let you get by one day with something you're gonna bring something back the next day just keep god at your heart at all times because he won't leave us we may sometimes feel like it but he's still there we're gonna read this morning from saint luke the 17th chapter verses 22 through 37 let us pray heavenly father we are grateful and thankful for this opportunity that you're given us to come together to worship lord we know that you promised us that you will never leave us not forsake us lord even when we may feel some time that we're alone lord

midnights early in the morning a couple we know that you are still near we ask you this day let the blessings and give us strength that we will keep holding on to you until the end father we love you and we know that you love us and we thank you in jesus name amen let's read from saint luke the 17th chapter beginning with the 22nd verse the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it far as the lightning the lightness out of the parts under heaven shining unto the other part under heaven so shall the son a man be in his day as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man [Music] likewise also it it was in the days a lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they built even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed remember that's why i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed that shall be taken one shall be taken and the other shall be left two men shall be in the field and the one shall be taken and the other left and they are asked well lord he shall unto them whose shall everybody is thou will the eagles be gathered together i mean god

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] to me oh god is [Music] [Music] i [Music] [Music] amen he's the one that saved us he's one that died for us he's the one that heals us he's the one that gives us eternal life that's why god is so good and he's so good to who not you me make it personal amen good to be in the house with the lord good to have each and every one of you here i know we got some away on vacation it's uh spring break time so it's time to take a little break but uh god bless you we love you with the love of the lord last night bible study was wonderful we have a good time and um i think it's something we're going to try to do from now on is um hook up to the zoom meeting part of it so if you can't come you can watch it online and it was good one this is afraid to be able to watch and and the brothers and sisters from ohio we were just sitting up there last weekend and they said well we can we hear your bible study because we we recorded on a little bitty recorder and then brother joe puts it online maybe you know several days or even a week later sometimes and they said we we would like to be able to where we could ask questions also so um when i got back we got with brother anderson the bulldog he's now an official bulldog so brother anderson and brother luis brother richard robertson brother joe and all the different ones they all kind of put their heads together and and came up with this zoom meeting and we had a camera downstairs and and the ones from ohio were able to see us and we were able to see them so uh they're just part of us we're just an extension of you know we got extended family man but uh thank god for our brothers that put all that together for us so man also wednesday night brother aaron will be ministering for us um remember too that uh april the 15th 16th and 17th will be our um i guess first annual easter meeting brother joel fournier will be here at seven o'clock um from the home of angora at three and then brother mike ultieg at regular service on sunday now we got to get together with the food uh mom's compiling the list in june both of them are looking at that just releasing different ones just get with them we'll announce it next sunday from here uh what to bring we're expecting a pretty good crowd there'll be 10 or 11 or 12 from ohio there'll be um several from brother homer's church that's staying over and brother joe's put it online so there's already a brother called this morning and the reason i'm saying this is if you have a place where somebody can stay i know that uh brother joe canada's house will be full my house will be full brother louise's house will be pretty much full if they all come um one of the one of the one of the kids is having acl surgery so we don't know if he's going to be able to make it or not but we're going to pray that he is and then you've got brother boyd's got a couple staying with him and then there's a brother from brother tom creshan's church um he's called this morning and he would like a place to pay if we can so let's just all get together if you want to write it down or tell somebody you tell me or sister june uh if you have a place for someone to stay we would appreciate it and uh we'll uh we'll give you some money for the food and all those things because it's saving uh it's saving them a 100 a night motel bill and it it's it just saves them from eating i i kind of like brother brother emanuel salazar when he had his meetings in june he told me he said brother wait he said i don't want people to fly or drive all the way out here and then have to pay for a room and then have to pay for a meal so they cooked every meal for people out there and all the preachers that came in they took care of their room so so i just don't want it to be a burden i want you to be happy in the lord but i don't it money it takes money sorry it takes money to get here takes money to go home it takes money to stay so we want to uh take the burden off that's why on saturday after the service we're going to have a full we'll have a full meal on that day so just keep that on prayer brother dale's birthday will be that day on the 16th and just remember also um tentatively now on that saturday april the 16th not next saturday april the 16th there'll be a baptismal service at 12 o'clock somewhere all right they want to be baptized if we have to if we have to buy a pool or if we have to i'm going to talk to a couple of baptist friends of mine in guildsville and see if they'll let us borrow their pool but they want to be baptized we're going to baptize them and man one way or the other you know if it was your family you'd want to be baptized too and you want and and they want couple from ohio wants to be baptized so we're going to do that at 12 o'clock to be determined but i'll let you know next sunday that's the only time we can do it and we want to get it done because we won't be able to do it saturday night won't be able to do it friday won't be able to do it sunday because they're all going to go back home but a couple from ohio wants to be baptized amen and anybody else that wants to be baptized we open it for anybody you know that to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ christian baptism and walking in god amen amen and today this afternoon we're going to be taking communion so we'll have communion and foot washing this afternoon so being the first sunday so just keep your minds clear and let's turn to john 1 verse 1 and let's begin remember brother aaron will be speaking for us wednesday we've got several things in august that's coming up brother joe's working on a calendar for april so he can put it up on the screen so that we can not forget what i just said what did i just say forget what i just said john 1 verse 1 but just pray for each and every one i'm like brother bob in different ones you you feel an urgency somewhere you just don't know enough i don't have enough sorry discernment but that you feel the urge or the pull that something something needs to happen and it's not that we're going to try to make it happen but we're just going to walk in the word of god and let god do it that way it won't be just an emotion or a feeling it'll be a heartfelt something coming from the heart and if it comes from the heart if you got the new birth it's god amen so if you've got any birth in your heart that's god and he's one to what he's wanting to open you up so you can see him in your life that's why we're talking on who is this son of man we're looking at his life the life of jesus christ the man all right this afternoon we'll bring a little bit different um avenue this afternoon but this morning let's continue on and let's uh background a little bit in john 1 verse 1 let's pray the heavenly father we thank you for this day lord we pray that you would be with us lord during this service you be the active participant lord you do the revealing you do the speaking and lord lord just be with each one father just give us a renewed as we renew our vows many times lord we're already married but we'd like to renew our vow our vows to to just just reaffirm that we're married to you lord reaffirm that you're there with us father we pray lord that you'd be with each one that's sick we have sick here in this service we have sick that's out in the internet and at different places we have sick that are at home lord we pray that you're just healing father you're still in the healing business but lord we want the healing of the soul first we want to make sure everybody's got their soul healed before we take on the other part lord it will just completely trust in you lord you're still like the healer that the prophet of god gave us the um he showed us the example of what to do lord that you would come and and you would heal the people from all diseases not just a few but all diseases and the bible tells us that if we believe believe in our heart and confess with our mouth so lord lord we're believing that and confessing today that you'll heal the people father keep us lord safe in your arms lord we need you more than anything now the the wilds of the world is trying to creep in on every hand they're trying to separate us and move us about and and lord your little bride will be beat up but she won't be defeated amen so i pray lord that you just be with each one today lord give us the words to say to the people and may they hear lord from you in jesus name we pray amen in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory as it only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so let's read romans 8 verse 18 for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be what revealed in us that's speaking toward the son of man all right listen for i reckon that the sufferings not the parties not the flowery betta bees not the smooth road not the wide road amen so that leads you to destruction for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god you may be seated in the lord as blessing we were talking last night about where brother branham was talking in in uh i believe it's 1964 and paraphrasing he said he said i uh he said what you see in part is going to be brought in its fullness when the church comes to power amen now listen we've got power now but there's a power coming and i'll read you the quote a little bit later on there's a power coming and we'll look at it this afternoon with the chart that we'll look at later at the end of the service that brother bob's been using on the statue of perfect man and the three stages as you grow up you know as we sit here today we have the holy ghost in our soul if you're born again you have the holy ghost in your soul all right well listen jesus was on the river jordan he was the holy ghost he didn't need the holy ghost he was the holy ghost that soul that was inside of him was the soul of god and the spirit was the spirit of god it wasn't a separate person amen but you and i get it by measure but he had an anointing that came on him in the river at the river jordan why did he need that anointing it was for his ministry it was for something you you look at brother browner and he'll he'll preach a sermon and it'll be revelation like you wouldn't believe and then all of a sudden he said well we're going to have a prayer line well you would think man that anointing would just no he said it's a different anointing what'd he say i'm waiting on him well well him was there all the time him was doing the preaching but him was getting ready to step over into another part or phase of his ministry well that's the same way with you and i'm going up to snatch a perfect man you don't get the new birth two or three times you get the new birth one time but you get a feeling of the holy ghost an anointing a revelation as you could progress up the statue of a perfect man or as we walk through life uh we were talking you know just yesterday at this bible study and i i stumble at my words but i'm trying to think of i don't want to be so brash about it but i mean how are you going to make it without somebody teaching you the statue of perfect man everybody wants the great seals they want the third pool to work in their life god is not going to use a baby to bring the dead out of the ground it's going to be a mature listen jesus was almighty god as a baby right but there was nothing sad for 29 years of that man's life except right there at 13 when he popped up and was in the temple right they call it the silent years there was a silent time in there what he was growing in grace and knowledge that humanity part of him was being human but he did come to a place there at the river jordan where god said all right this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell and then he still had to walk for three more years in that anointing before the other before the other anointing came down before the other anointing came down at the mountaintop and said this is my beloved son hear ye him all right we should have heard him back before but really when you come up to this point it's like brother brown i'm preaching to 47 to 63 and all of a sudden god said if you're going to get anything you can get it from him because this is now his message this is now his message and remember john 17 and the great part of the scripture that john and and the different ones portray as you know his movement through his journey is that the river jordan sure he preached the kingdom of heaven is at hand he had great healing signs and wonders and many things went on right but re look at it after matthew 17 after the mountain transfiguration um part of his ministry started brother brown said six months later he was dead but he preached the seals in matthew 24. all right john 17 he prayed that we be one then now why didn't he do that you know what i'm saying even in his even in his ministry he progressed amen so even in brother brown's ministry he progressed so any any any minister uh if you're not seeing a progression in their message then you you know there's they're either stumbling or they're going around the mountain the same you know like they were before that's the same way with all of us we need to be where now we we understand not by rev not by knowledge not by head knowledge but by that knowledge understand more about the word of god and many places that we were talking about last night there's many places that you can go and preach to and you have to background so much till you never get to your sermon because they're not well taught but there's not a preacher ever stepped in this pulpit that said i'm gonna have to talk for two or three hours to get you all to know what i'm talking about no they always step in and they say you've been well hey man you've been well taught all right because they know they know that the background all right they say what they want to about this church and about the ministry i really don't care but i think we're on the right track if we're not we'd better like brother dale said if this is not it we need to find something we need to find what is it but romans 8 18 gives us an earnest expectation we're going to talk about that a little bit later on but we know that we are predestinated to adoption so see that's our anointing math you know you take you take martin luther you take john wesley even the pentecostals they were not predestinated to adoption because they didn't have all of the word they didn't have an open book they didn't have something to go to they they had they had reformers i'm trying to pick my words because they were prophets okay even though even though they father son holy ghost and they had all these little things that was off god winked at that because he knew that the fullness would come which was here with us the fullness would be here so god is patiently waiting on us to get to that spot and i believe we're at that spot now amen and like i said before you can stay home and listen to tapes all you want to but you will never come to full maturity without a pastor and without the fivefold ministry and coming to church it ain't going to happen they ain't going to happen because the bible said it's not going to happen okay so you can you can you can uh i hate to say this you're denying the word you're denying the word when you say i can get it on my own or or as um some were talking as we were talking this morning about the zoom meeting every time we do something like that you know you you picture people that are sitting around drinking coffee with their bunny jammies on and their bunny shoes on watching the paul did you have yours on yesterday freda said he did i realize people can't all get to church okay but if if you make it an excuse to stay home um yeah i have a problem with that so does god because he told us in the bible he didn't say zoom your meetings he said come to church assemble yourself together but if you can't um that's what we were talking about you know if we start doing zoom meetings on the bible study the room will be empty i don't think so i think it was full last night so and there were several many that weren't there so i think we're okay but just don't let use that as a crutch don't use it as a crutch and i know as we get older like sister johnny and certain ones man it's a it's a blessing a blessing to be able to to enter in she was so happy i think she called mama she called the pope she called the president she called the congress and she called june this morning about 7 30. praising the lord that she could enter into the service just enough to be able to see the service and and you know enter into the service of us being there amen so that's okay and that's all right but just don't make it a crutch all right don't make it a crutch the word says well i really don't my cat's sick so i'm not going to church i've heard that before but we're predestinated to adoption brother louis said yeah we are predestinated to adoption so we're not predestinated to just come and sit in church and listen to a good sermon and say thank you lord and go home we're predestinated to adoption which is going to do what now it's going to carry us it's going to carry us into the statue of a perfect man which then god's going to do something with that person we'll talk about that in a little while positionally placed i'll read a quote where brother brown says only this message you can be positionally placed amen only in this message you can be positionally placed hey man thank god for a prophet thank god for the message of the hour that he gave you a message and that you responded to that message all right so let's go to ephesians one verse one we're just backgrounding this morning to bring what we need this this afternoon is everybody all right amen i'm gonna quit doing this because they all started doing it ohio they're all doing this and do you hear me now i just want to know if you hear me paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus now that's who he's talking to us all right grace be to you in peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ and we look at verse three we look at that being show that was in the mind of god said blessed be the god and father my lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places according as he has chosen us in him chosen us not by him there's a lot of people chosen by god to do a certain thing everything is ordained of god listen folks god orchestrates this whole thing you say no no the devil god orchestrates this whole thing satan is a puppet in the hand of god because he's never god's never going to be defeated amen according as he has chosen us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love where were we before the beginning of time where were we brother branham where were we he said we were nothing only in the mind of god only in the mind of god we were something we were we were the genesis 1 26 we were the part of god that he was getting ready to unfold or unveil in this great plan of redemption all right that we should be holy and without blame before him in love see what god's already seen he's already seen us holy it's what we're going to talk about this this afternoon you we've got to come to a place that that we've been truly justified you say oh brother i got justified uh is brother bibletown we got justified before the new birth you got justified for the sins you used to do but brother brown said the unclean spirit's still there and you're going to continue sinning on down the road now listen if we continue sinning on down the road we ain't got the new birth once we come to the new birth to the justification we're going to talk about this afternoon which is the real you didn't do it then we got to come to a place that listen to take a body change you got to realize that that person inside of you is blameless now it is now already but we're not realizing it we're letting the past get a hold of us we're letting this and and this person didn't shake my hand and this person don't preach long enough and this one preaches too long that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having what predestinated by for knowledge by for knowledge by your free will so i don't have a choice you got a choice every day of your life you've got a choice today choose you this day who you'll serve amen having predestinated us what this is the mind of god seeing down through time seeing everything that's going to happen seeing every avenue that you would take even though you didn't make that choice oh my yeah you get quiet brother dale's preached it too about several years ago and y'all all got quiet too i remember that because if he's infinite he knows every avenue you would take if you had decided this or decided this or decided this he knew what avenue you would take that's why i've always told you that god's nose are the best yes you'll ever get because you're wanting to go down this path and you're just hell-bent to go down this path and god goes um i'm shutting the door well that's the best yes you'll ever get because god knows what's behind that door and what you do when that door opens amen so that's the best thing to do is listen to the word of god listen to your pastor listen to the ones that have wisdom that when you tell them you're going to do something and i like what brother dale's always said he said he said when you come and tell me you're going to do something he said what do you want me to do what do you want me to do you already decided what you're going to do you're telling me what you're going to do but if you approach it to look i've got these two options brother i've got this option in this option which option looks good all right instead of coming the brother down saying i'm i'm going to do this what do you think about it that's kind of the cart before the horse amen but think about that in all that you do i mean we make up our mind a lot of times to do stuff we've never done it before we make up our mind to do something and it doesn't matter if we if the door closes we're a little bit headstrong and we just butt right on through the door watch what a goat does but but but but having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and his will is his word find yourself in the word of god let's look at number one real quick now preaching usually catches the sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is now it doesn't just place you it places you positionally all right it places you positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith i keep reading this quote and i'm going to keep reading it because we can never i'm talking about us all of us we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are now he's not talking about this faith right here because according to that you're already born again you've got to have position your position goes here this is where you find your position but that faith right there is a faith that nobody's ever had before is to take a body change without death that's what we were talking about last night let's go to number two real quick adoption 1960. now what is adoption now let me get this now continue down your adoption is not your birth so we've already separated the two that you can be born again today and not be adopted but there is a spirit of adoption there is a open door of adoption that you can step in if you want to if you don't want to god's not going to kick you through the door no he's a gentleman remember remember the holy ghost is a gentleman but if you let him in your house let him in your house and you say all right i got pride i'm gonna get this door open and i'm gonna get rid of that thing then you know what god will step in and take care of that all right if we let him your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing when you were born again when you're born of the spirit of god you're sons of god but we were predestinated now here's what i'm trying to get to you for the sons of the white of the last day that's us see we were predestinated unto adoption now here we are now this is what hurts pentecost a little bit and i'm talking about the pentecost in this message we were talking about last night we've had 60 years of journey way more than they had in the children of israel in in egypt 60 years we've wandered in the wilderness what what have we got people churches breaking up people quitting the message people preaching error preaching people can't preach anything but just uh god sent a prophet you think about it why we've been here 60 years brother brown said the rapture was overdue in the 50s 58 59 60 somewhere now he said the rapture is way overdue way past due well guess what now it's way way way way past due but i like what brother michael said brother michael said he said it was it was past due but he hadn't been born yet so god was waiting on him to get here that makes it personal he's waiting on me to come to a place remember brother brown says god's waiting on you he's waiting on me what adoption time we read this a long time ago but yet there ain't that ain't what i'm talking about he said fine you're a child of god but yet that ain't what i'm talking about see you were predestinated into adoption adoption is placing a son then we started on the three stages of adoption let's go through this real quick we'll slow down this afternoon but i want you to keep this in your mind and in your heart because there's three stages of adoption the first stage is the birth and in that birth it's three stages they're all right with that and that birth there is three stages it's always justification and sanctification baptism in the holy ghost i love what brother brown said you know there's a there are certain people in the message that just believes that when you you know you you got it all when you believe or that you didn't need nothing else you know you just boom there you are like we were talking last night most people most people in the christian world believe that god's just going to come just going to pick a random day and he's coming god's not random god's not random in anything he has a plan and a purpose for everything that he does so there is a red letter day on his calendar but you don't know what it is but he knows there's somebody going to come to maturity and somebody's going to fulfill not part of the word but every word of god amen we're going to do the things that we're supposed to do according to the bible but the first stage of adoption is getting you in the family we've been over that but let's go over it again you've got to get into family first don't worry listen don't worry about third pull don't worry about these words that we that we bring out of a full adoption don't worry about adoption until you get bored again when you know that you know that you know that god resides in your soul and look you're doing the abcs that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon we've been flew up to the headstone we don't got a a a doctorate degree in in message 101. by that time it's like 401 right but we're still down here i can't read i i i can't do my i can't i can't one plus one's what and we're already wanting up here listen there is a way to get up there and there is a pull to get you up there but you got to go through we'll read this quote i think i may have it this morning if not this afternoon brother adam preaches on time-tested memorials but he also says time-tested christians i'm just a christian that's it no that just gets you started on your journey and every one of us have a journey and it's it's all different but it's one goal many spokes of the wheel but only one centerpiece that turns the axle all right same way with the word of god you can't get out of the word of god and say well i'm going to get bored again and this is the way i'm i'm going to act no when you get born again you should be acting like what god tells you how to act amen but that's what i'm telling you we've got people and and and i read a quote several several weeks ago where brother brown talks about teaching and he said it settles the people now right now there's a lot of churches that's not settled you can decide whether this one is or not but there's a lot of churches that's unsettled because you got that little group that says they're right on that edge well i don't know if if it seems like that that brother brown may be right but this group over here says we we can just need we just need to stay home because it's so confusing i agree i agree there's a lot of confusion out here but there is truth but there's a lot of confusion out here which makes people withdraw and say well i'll just listen to what brother brown said well you can for a while but you can't stay in the bible and do that you can't raise your you can't go up the statue of perfect man if you sit at home sorry and you know i'm tired of people making excuses look at brother golly i was thinking about when he was standing up here he's been doing this for 50 years 50 years you've been a christian that long because you've been in this church almost that long stands up here reads the scripture and i wish i could pray like he prays see that's my prayer warrior i know that man is talking to god why because he's been on a journey he's come now to the journey part to where he should be and he is i say should be he should be a seasoned veteran and you listen to people like that that are seasoned veterans but i appreciate god putting and see that's one of the gifts that's a positional place we want to have the speaking in tongues and the prayer lines and all that stuff the bible says nine spiritual gifts is wisdom faith all those different things and what brother brown say we always pick the lesser gift because why it gets emotional you know i really have never seen brother carly emotional i really want to when we get a body change i want to see your emotion that when that happens hey man brother colley's just been he's like an old he's like an engine steady is a rock that's why he worked for chevrolet the lord i'm not making that up romans 8 verse 14 for as many as led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so how can you be led by the spirit of god and not do the things of god and do them and do them out of love don't do them out of well i better go church brother the way he's going to preach on me if i don't yeah that's probably true but you got to be led out of spirits by the spirit of god not led by my spirit you've got to be led by the spirit of god for yourself for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father i've seen people and and to get a good case of justification if you get a real case of justification or a real um repentant attitude uh that's good but remember that unclean spirit's still there and you're going to be bound this says for you have not received the spirit of bondage again if you're not born again you're under bondage i don't care if you're even justified and sanctified you're still under bondage because there's an unclean spirit that's in you it may be driven out but if you can't get the holy ghost in there the devil's going to come right back in there again amen and you're going to receive the spirit of bondage again to fear you know what you're going to be bound to a church a religion a denomination that's what you're going to be bound to you're not going to be bound to the beer joint satan's smarter than that he wants you to come to church but he wants you to think everything's fine we're okay we're good no listen i i think brother colly and brother dale brother darty and the different ones that's been here forever are y'all ever satisfied in spirituality are you ever satisfied no you're not you're not satisfied you always want to get that one little bit more that one little extra revelation that one little extra something from god amen we all do that and that's what we should do and not be just where we get the holy ghost and we lay down and quit fighting no that's just when your fight starts but he's give us the spirit of adoption though where we can move over and have some authority that's what we'll talk about this afternoon with with a positionally placed son and daughter of god there's authority that comes with that there's a name on the checkbook there's been able to drive the car there's joshua positionally placing them in the land and they establish their their borders they establish who they are i'm dan i'm ephraim i'm manassa i'm this i'm that and you stay where you're supposed to be cause that's your position all right everybody okay with that so now look now watch and the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit yes if you're not born again your spirit is contrary to god i don't care who you are your spirit is contrary to god so the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we're the children of god that's the new birth that puts that all together that we are not going to be but we are the children of god and if children let's move it over then heirs heirs of god and what joint heirs with christ whatever christ gets we get now what are we talking about we're talking about the son of man revelation right well that who was christ he is the son of man amen join heirs with christ look if f so be that we suffer with him amen that we may be also glorified together where was the suffering the suffering was in the son of man the suffering was not in the son of god it was in the son of man when god came down and got in human flesh that's when his suffering began everybody all right with that so that brings us the air that brings it down brother bob it brings us boom we're together he suffered we're going to suffer he was lonely we're going to be lonely he got cast out we got cast out he almost got stoned they stoned us with their words anyway but look it says though look that we may be glorified together glorified together all right now let's go to second peter one simon peter a servant apostle of jesus christ to them that kind of have a little of some kind of faith it says to them that have obtained amen the lights came on you've dug it out with god you've fought the battle god's fought the battle with you but you have obtained like precious faith which is now that's talking about this faith with us through the righteousness of god even our savior jesus christ are in and besides this given all diligence so besides this yes everybody with me besides this giving diligence add to your faith versus knowledge temperance patience godliness it's a requirement listen it's a requirement that you move it's your free will whether you do or not but you'll always be a weak christian sorry you'll always be a weak christian you may be born again you may be a son and daughter of god you you get all the you get all the blessings of god but you'll be a baby and what does babies do we have to change our diapers we have to feed them we have to powder them we have to pamper them that's why i believe brother dale's he's he's got some grown-ups because he's not pampered in baby this church like other pastors pampering baby churches hey he's sitting there i'm gonna give him his i'm gonna give him his crown now all right amen he built a church that don't have to be i'm so sorry pray for my children he's a pray for myself i'll help you pray but i ain't your pope that's what happens a lot in the message they try to get to you know they like me and bob was talking about you know you get forgiven of something and you still want to come through the door and and crawl on nails and we gotta learn to get rid of that thing and know it's under the blood know that god can't ever bring it up again oh hallelujah he'll never bring it up again he'll never bring it up to your presence again never listen there's no way he can even if he wanted to because his bible says he's throwing it in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again but we still sat like like brother fernie wow zee wild you i'm having all these problems let's take care of the first problem the first problem is know that you're born again know that you've got the new birth not just anointing not just i come to this church i just i got a message that uh nobody else is god i got something nobody else has got listen that's the way i felt when i was 14 years old i'll just be real with you there's books and and and notes that i think brother tom kept some of them and gave them back to me their dad mom kept them for a long time where i read i read books i i circled stuff i wrote stuff down and i he just i thought this message ain't nobody else got one like this and i got the best message there is well you know who came came to the house knocked on the door and i let him in the devil so for about 20 years i served him instead of the word of god all right because i made a choice amen i made a choice it was a bad choice but you know what we make bad choices that just don't stay in those bad choices all right don't stay in the bad choices don't don't go around horeb yourself all right you got to get out you got to turn north you got to say god there's my promised land and that's where i'm going to get put my victory is over there all right acts 2 38 says and it came to pass that when all the kings of the amorites well i'm sorry joshua act 238 i was going to quote that's our promise so joshua 5 verse 1 we won't read all this to save time but remember what happened when the children of israel come out of egypt they walked in the wilderness for what 40 years all right and that wilderness was called what the wilderness of sin look in your bible it was called the wilderness of sin well that's what they walked in they walked in the wilderness of sin until what happened all those ice got out all those dathans and chorus and all those doctrines got bled out died and this new group rose up but they hadn't been circumcised and circumcision was really important because if you weren't circumcised you wouldn't you right god told them under abraham said this is your sign that you're mine as you do this circumcision on the males eight days after they're born so verse two says make sharp knives and circumcise sharp knives word of god and circumcise again the children of israel the second time so listen we've had a we've had a lutheran age we've had a wesley age we've had a pentecostal age we've had a and i want to say beginning of the message age brother branham was was preaching to all different denominations trying to get them all together trying to get him to see the message of the hour but remember he preached all the i was listening the other day in california he said you sisters he said i come out here every year and i preach on hair and dress and he said you get worse well what was it they weren't getting his message they were getting the feeling from the healing right they were getting they were getting a feeling from the discernment but the greatest discernment was him to look at them women and men and say you're not living right you hadn't lived right to begin with that's why pentecost failed that's why they said no oh no i can speak in tongues it doesn't matter if i cut my hair it doesn't matter if i you know commit adultery it doesn't matter if i do this it's just this over here i speak in tongues brother brown said they stopped right there but there had to be another set circumcised there had to be another group that come up that not just the circumcision of the holy ghost down here you know that that circumcises you here but i see holy spirit right here i see the the apex of the holy spirit here so there there's a circumcision a cutting away of the skin in the journey this is what they're doing they're getting ready though they went through the journey they're getting ready to go in the promised land and actually they walk into the promised land this is when they were stepped over jordan into the promised land right and god reminded joshua said look man these people have not been circumcised if they're going if i'm going to positionally place them you know what he was god was saying to me they're gentiles listen to what i'm saying and because i told you my people the jewish race is going to circumcise on the eighth day and that makes you a jew that puts you under the the protection of abraham i guess you might say the promise i gave abraham was that if you're circumcised then they'll be a part of me well there was so many thousands of people 20 and under that he didn't consider israelites and they were fixing to positionally get the property they were supposed to get what am i saying get it right even though we have to stand and as i said before and you make a joke out of it but men ought to understand what i'm saying at eight years old or eight days old you're not gonna remember that circumcision but when you're 20 years old you're going to remember that circumcision so that's the same thing in our journey you're going to remember when god circumcises your heart in this journey god cut the foreskin off and then let's go into the promised land let's go take what we're supposed to take and joshua did that remember he did the verse seven and their children whom he raised up in their stay of them joshua circumcised i was thinking about this the other day it's kind of what we were talking about this uh last night everything reminds me to me there was a pivotal time there in in the seals when brother ryan was preaching the the up to the sixth seal and then he had questions and answers and he told the people you're not getting it it's not for you okay they got stuck in the promised land right on the border because remember a type of that you take uh what is it a half tribal manasseh and the other two tribes they stayed on this side of jordan now they went across and helped them fight but brother brown said that was a type of luther wesleyan pentecost or justification sanctification the baptism holy ghost so that's what happened they went in and fought but they came back out listen i don't want to fight and come back out i don't know why they did that well you know there's a story behind it but but i want to take in that prom my promised land was on that side of jordan mine and your promised land is on that side of jordan what jordan is what a type of death my property is going to be over there but you got to die out to yourself first you've got to have verse seven their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their place in the camp till they were whole in other words until they healed that's the same thing with you coming to church it don't hurt to sit at home and listen or watch because you can just kind of filter out you know the cat can walk by or right but when you're in church and you got to look at me or you got to look at somebody and they start walking down your aisle and stepping on your toes they something got to happen there's a reaction that's got to happen amen so when we're circumcising up here on sundays and wednesdays when we're doing the the the work of circumcision it's going to hurt but listen you're going gonna walk different you don't walk the same way you walked before and it does hurt but listen look what they had they went on in verse 11 god didn't say no i'm just going to throw them away no they began to eat the whole corner of the land or they began to eat more nutritious food more of what had already been planted in the land right manis east the old corner of the land came in other words i'm going to say this the miracles were over the the the hand to mouth bless you nurse the hand to mouth the hand to mouth was over you're not babies anymore i'm not gonna let your clothes not rot i'm not gonna give you water that runs with you every day i'm not gonna give you manna that you just hold your hand down and it hits your hand and you eat it you're going to work for it now we know that brother bible's talking about rest there is a rest but when you get born again that's just rest in your soul the fight's over inside but the fight starts on the outside and man it's the same way with them in the promised land listen elijah i mean elijah joshua didn't tell him say look now you just walk in over there and you just tell them who you are and they gonna just all fall dead right that's what we think that's what happens when we have a good meeting like you know sunday a couple sundays ago i don't say we have bad meetings but the spirit of the lord fell and you could feel it even last sunday when we were up there in ohio you could feel the spirit of god settle into the building and people were worshiping not worshiping because the neighbor worshipped or not worshipped because of neighbor worship they worshiped because god had come to them god had come to them and not anybody else all right and whatever situation you had that you were praying about did it get settled bruce got settled didn't it you see what i mean that's telling you that the fight's over but you gotta fight a battle first you don't just walk in and and uh we were talking about something the other day and you know people have a uh a tendency even in the message to to put preachers up on the pedestal and and you know unreachable and and uh you know he's so holy and you know listen when i got called to preach when brother dale got called to preach brother bob different ones got called to preach by the aaron brothers our bills kept coming i delivered a lot of them myself and and my grass just didn't stop growing in april and never grow again until october and brother brother bob's car never run out of gas huh and i go out in the garden and i work and and the mud would just fall off me never had to take a bath you're saying someone's saying you know what i'm saying we always think if the reason i'm saying this is because we have a position but you also have a position deacon's elders all y'all have a place positionally placed but don't think because you're positionally placed you just stepped into a bubble right what brother brown say when you get born again satan turns every gun right to you and i mean he doesn't just go no he said [Laughter] hey man am i hitting something so this positionally placing in the promised land even though according to that scripture right there according to the scripture turn it back to verse one please we'll get into the second stage this afternoon go back go the other way i'm sorry i don't know which way that me and daddy don't have directional let's go go to verse 1. look it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites all their mites and they were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel our problem is it's like brother gary atkins always said he's a bluff he's a bowl with no he's got a bow with no arrows when we get up in the morning we hand him a fistful of arrows say here shoot me even though he's got the bow and he's a bluff here shoot me devil but that's the same way there then then if that would have been able to be put into a a message book it already is but if that would have been put in a message book that would tell you whatever fight you was going to have they didn't have no fighting to begin with same way with the devil remember we in the scripture i believe it's in ezekiel where we look at this man laying on the side of the road a drunks laying in his own vomit and we say is this the man that caused me all this trouble that in other words that ruled the nations that caused the battle of armageddon that caused the battle that we all fight and he's nothing but a sought drunk laying in the land in the street i know devil hates that but you know what if you believe the bible he's already written and that's going to happen and he's not even going to judgment he's going to be stuck in the lake of fire before the white throne judgment according to the bible because he's already been judged all right so there was no fight in them but remember even though there was no fight in them they still had to fight there was no there was no there was nothing jericho man even rahab said look when y'all crossed that river and we heard y'all crossed that river and god opened up the waters that was it we didn't know how he was going to win this thing but we knew that god was with you that's why that when all these times that god or the people were trying to build the temple the natural temple it's been destroyed like 17 times in jerusalem that's why they're trying to build it back again but the whole why does the whole world hate israel just because they're jews no they are the people of god bible tells you that now whether they were divorced and put away and they they've they're not bribed anymore that's not the world's not thinking that they're thinking if this is the children of god and they get that temple built back they're going to be more powerful than a nuclear warhead because they're going to have god and they're going to have miracles that's why all them people around them hate them they don't want to build nothing they don't want to get back restore israel back to its its prominent power why because like i said before that when you read in the book of of ezra and different ones they had a sword in one hand and a trial in the other hand the people around them knew the cities and the countries around jerusalem knew that if they'd ever built that city back they were going to become powerful and they didn't want to do it now that's the same way with me and you build your wall with a trial in this hand and a sword in this hand amen know that god's told you you've got a position and that position is that you're a child of god and that you will have authority to build what you need to build and to destroy what you need to destroy that's what we got to come to folks but their heart melted if we really realized it if we really come under the power of god satan has to tremble he can't stand that anointing not that kind of anointing now he can stand all anointings all them good feelings and all them good things but he can't stand the word of god in power he can't stand that because he can't get either one he can't get the word he can't put the word together and he can't get that anointing that you and i have on us he would have been jesus if it had that same anointing but i thought that anointing was on me and you so the rest of us just going to be a big fight and it's going to be a fight until we get out of here listen we're going to squeeze out of here we're not going to go out on the flower bed of ease we're not going to go out on the broad highway we're not going to go out and everybody's patting us on the back side boy y'all doing good no they're going to hate us like they did jesus they're going to put us to death they don't have to do it spirits i mean naturally they do it spiritually amen but there's a temple being built there's a temple being built not with hands of man but a body a body of flesh with an outer court an inner court and a holy of holies amen and that's where god wanted to reside right here in that holy of holies sure he sure he had things on the outside the menorah and the different things but inside that holy of holies was one thing that was the word of god and god came to that word of god we were talking about that uh in ohio last week about solomon when that listen the shekinah glory didn't come when the art was over here because it was out of its place it was still the word of god but when the priest picked it up all right they go through the outer court solomon's already built this great big temple it's beautiful man it's got pearls and i think the bible even says gold and silver that you couldn't even weigh it it was so much they overlaid about everything in gold here they come in they're singing they're praising god they come into the outer court they come into the inner court it's kind of glorious still not there but when that thing went in and the bible says they turned and they set the ark down and then they pulled the staves or they pulled the poles they pulled the poles out that means it was going to stay right there that thing got into its positionally placed spot and when it got into that spot what happened the bible says the shekinah glory came in that building so much so the priest had to shut up the people had to shut up and the power of an anointing listen and this was just wood and paper and a little bit of stone that's all it was but god said that's where i put my name god should do the same thing with me and you we've been through justification sanctification now to baptism the holy ghost and the priests are pulling the staves out and what happens is that curtain falls down like this and when it falls down you don't go back there anymore but now what did they tell us in the new testament though it's all open now we have an open book we have an open altar we have an open holy of holies because we walk around in that holy of holies never all right but that's what you have to look at we look at that we see that god is you know what god did he challenged solomon to build that temple because see david was commissioned david's one that said hey i want to get i want to have it built but who built it solomon built it the son of man built it the temple the right temple the one that was exactly the way god wanted it wasn't just a now remember the one in the wilderness was temporary hello the one in the wilderness was temporary he had badger skin and they had to overlay it with this and and they had to haul it and it was always covered with something they'd set it down in the middle and they camp around it which was good but david said in other words i've had enough of this carrying around i live in a house i live in a real big mansion and god's out there in the elements underneath that badger skin and all that different colors i want him to be in here you know what he said i want him to be comfortable where he's at so god said i know you have a desire i know in 1963 the prophet told you you had a desire to sit under that ministry everybody with me but god said you can't build that house too much bloodshed too much bloodshed but the sun is going to build the house the son of man is going to come in human flesh and build the house and then he's going to go back and then he's going to come back on the day of pentecost as the son of god and they're going to go out according to court holy of holies but i'm not satisfied there i want you to build me this big temple make you look like a pyramid and my son's going to build it and then he's going to come back in the end he's going to pray read the prayer of solomon it's a beautiful prayer we read that thing sunday and it just everybody fell apart a man a human man stands and gets on his knees with his hands raised to god he said god these are your people and we've done exactly what you've told us to do have we done exactly what he's told us to do if you have then you can say uh and then god can fill that holy of holies with so much power until you can't say a word there's nothing can be said nothing can be added what is the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour the shekinah glory had filled the room full there was nothing else to be said there was nothing else to be revealed everything happens a secret though because remember there were many nations around israel at the time but he made solomon so powerful till there's no army could defeat him oh hallelujah there's no army could defeat him and then he built the temple and it was not a hammer or a saw nothing they made those pieces give them the dimensions eleven hundred of them come on somebody eleven that we've been giving 1100 sermons that you don't have to saw it up you don't have to beat it with a hammer you just what put it together fifo ministry we'll put it together and then we will what we will enter that temple and be not just look at the shekinah glory we will be the shekinah glory we will be the one that anoints that temple in in the millennium that we're going to talk about at bible study next next sunday or next saturday or no next first saturday of the month but that's what we're going to be we're not going to be somebody standing out here i thought we were already inside there but he's just going to just keep piling the shekinah glory on top of us let's read this one quote and then we'll finish right here let's go to brothers let's go to number eight and i'll read the rest of them oh let's go to number seven and then we'll then we'll close musicians get ready to come here ye him 1960 number seven quote number seven just keep scrolling through we'll get we'll get the rest of them some other time all right placing of a son take him out in a certain place have a ceremony before angels and place him positionally what he is in the body of christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that i'm speaking of will be done here's a prophet prophesying there'll be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen powers like that come into the church now i know it for a fact say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe don't doubt believe that what you've said was come to pass and you have what you have said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church critics mouths will be shut we got them all over the place now it'll be a short time jesus came right off the mountain we talked about mountain transfiguration went straight to calvary notice it won't be long but it will be there or here number eight questions and answers 1954 oh brother give me a church full of the holy ghost god will do in one year what all theologians or theology failed to do in 2000 you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that faithful the little remnant after the door the gentile closes gentiles is closed oh god will anoint a church then he who is filthy let him be filthy still he who is righteous let him be righteous still he's holy let him be holy still and god will anoint the church with the power of god and things will take place not only that then but he's doing it now all right let's read number nine oh i wish i had the ability to grind that into the people's hearts god is looking for a time-tested christian every son that cometh to god must be tried child trained tested and you who jump from pillar to post let me stop just a minute and you who jumped from pillar everybody believed brother brown was a prophet i don't think i asked you that today so some of you don't how many believe brother brown was the prophet oh thank you more of you some of you woke up and you who jump from pillar to post and this to that let that soak in this to that and in and out that just got of all of us didn't it how god can ever adopt you into his family or positionally place you that's a question mark in other words he's questioning how in the world if you jump from pillar to post this and that up and down in and out how can god ever adopt you into his family or positionally place you now think of that for a moment how can you be positionally placed when you will not stand still long enough for god to do it god let me stay still one time just long enough let me stand still one time and let me see my position musicians come we'll get on to a little bit more this afternoon but god he said brother we're not supposed to stand still well we ain't supposed to run out in front of the program of god either be still and know that i am god i think that's what you're looking at on the backside of that beam right there but how can you be positionally placed listen one more time i'll read this again every son that cometh to god must be tried child trained and tested and you who jump from pillar to post and this and that and in and out how can god ever adopt you into his family or positionally place you now think of that for a moment how can you be positionally placed when you will not stand still long enough for god to dress you let's stand our feet you love the lord he's trying to get us to come to a place where he can use you we listen we've been used by the devil long enough hello somebody we've been used by the devil long enough let's turn ourselves over and be used by god [Music] let that thing as again one more time let that thing out use that gift that god's given you don't ever suppress the gift that god gives you you need to pray about it but don't tell me you got a gift and you're in and out up and down pillar to post unsettled somewhere you got to be settled and listen then if you do that what's god obligated to his word he's not obligated to your thoughts or idea i don't think i need to go to church that much well that's not what god said i thought if we obeyed the word of god maybe some of our troubles will be over and we're all human beings we all do the same thing once we start getting in trouble what do we do we quit coming to church am i loud enough we quit coming to church we get in our little pity party our little shell when you should be under the anointing of the of the preacher and the and the fellowship in the church [Music] but you know what we've been preaching this for 50 or 60 years and people still as soon as trouble happens they head off somewhere no stand still be still and see the glory of god be still and watch your jordan part be still and watch the water come out of the rock and that water which is christ and let him follow you through your life and let him nurse you every time you need every time they need some water they just lord we have to dig wells and we have to go what about a river that followed them through the desert if they went this way the river was right there beside of them and it wasn't a little trickle because it fed two million people and their animals so it was a gusher of water but every day they could just dip their little dipper in it and drink the water that's what god will do for your life if you'll do what he says if you'll move get into this journey and move let's let's move on let's sing a song god bless you in the rock my brother okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] we don't have to explain to our sister what this is lord she already knows so lord the anointing that's with us today right now lord we pray that that anointing will carry on over into the nurses and to the doctors into the hospital wherever our sister has to go lord leading guide of the lord by your hand father our sisters give herself to you lord now i pray that you would give yourself to her in this time of need she's okay with that she's all right with that but lord i pray that you're anoint her and give her strength to go through this little bit of journey that she's going through lord we thank you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen confess your problems confess that you need healing [Music] there's honey [Music] what's he saying what's he meaning [Music] oh my lord oh that we know where he got that from but we're gonna pray that thing don't come back dear lord jesus that was just a child speaking lord please don't hold that against him lord he heard it from somewhere else lord i pray that you'll manifest yourself and that you'll prove to that child that you are not dead that you are a living god and you sent us a prophecy lord you've sent us a five-fold ministry to preach the people lord and we pray that you just be with that little child lord and help god because there's something god only lord that needs to come off of him so in the name of the lord jesus christ we praise it that'll leave our and he'll be blessed in jesus name amen that's what they get when they don't go to church and they listen to what somebody else has said so do you pray unto god the father what will thou have me to do oh never fear he will surely answer there's i just want to say something to the whole congregation um i know everybody knows what's going on with me and um i just and people are praying all of you are praying but what i need you to do is he is my high priest and he is interceding for me on my confession i just feel like that just bammed me and so what i need for you to do for me

said if you complain about even about your symptoms you don't have you can't be a christian you can't be healed that's right that's right same way with us we're going to confess it we're going to speak it and we're not going to say well well is he well he will bless her heart no we're all going to go through this together and when she needs holding up we're going to hold her up amen we're the church of god we're not the church of the devil and we've got promises that if we'd ask anything in his name anything in his name he'd give it to us he'd give it to us not with not charging us or we gotta you know we gotta stand on our head we gotta come say 10 hail marys we like the catholic church ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock and it'll be open to you so let's just
