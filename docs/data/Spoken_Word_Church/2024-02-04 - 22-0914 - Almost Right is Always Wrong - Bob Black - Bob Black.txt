amen God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord you come expecting tonight you ready to receive got your got your bowl ready I'm going to read um from Genesis chapter 3 tonight you want to turn your Bibles over to there if you have your Bible or they'll just pull it up on the screen like always and uh maybe take kind of a an interesting topic tonight almost right is always wrong I was telling that to the brothers back there and they were like tell me that again almost right is always wrong amen and we'll read from Genesis chapter 3 um verses 1 to8 Lord God we're so grateful to be a able to gather together around your word tonight Lord Jesus and as we look into your word and and unpack these things Lord that are laying there for us Lord these little nuggets of truth I pray God that your spirit will come and Quicken it to us and make it alive to us and put the puzzle pieces together Lord that it'll be profitable to us Grant it Lord that you'll just be at Liberty to move among us tonight Lord Jesus and Lord answer questions Lord and patch up things in our lives Lord Jesus and Deliver Us Lord and free us up Lord Jesus so we can have Liberty and true worship in you Lord grant it Lord that you'll give us something tonight that we can profit thereby from Lord and we we just ask this blessing upon your people and upon your word in the name of the Lord Jesus so it says now you know as as we read this you just think about what a blessing it is to be able to read this and to understand it what a blessing it is and um I've heard uh many ministers lately preaching about how that you know you think about brother Brandon would preach so many sermons and the people he was preaching to was against him I as actually I was studying this out I I I I I I you just you just pay attention to the the things that brother randam says as he's preaching serpent seed and all these many many other sermons as he's speaking to to Pentecostal people and whatnot they they don't they didn't agree with him and you think about what a blessing it is that we have to the blessing what a blessing it is that I have to be able to speak to people that agree you think so so maybe maybe tonight if you could just just uh just respond as though you would if brother Brandon was preaching to you amen like you believe it so verse one says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman ye hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of this of the garden God said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God do know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also under her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they SED fish leaves together and made themselves aprons you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word isn't it isn't it strange you know you really don't hear this preach on that much but I I want to take from this scripture that that thought that I shared with you earlier almost right is always wrong you know I think I think I think one one kind of thing that's kind of crept in among amongst message churches and message Believers is that is that we kind of get a little bit we kind of Overlook wrong and and we start just kind of opening up ourselves to all sorts of ideas and all sorts of thoughts but you know you got to maybe tonight just remind us that that almost right almost right where you where you get get up to the line and you're almost there but yet it's it's always wrong and you see Eve Eve here she started listening to just one word off that the the serpent was was throwing at her that just one word off caused everything that we see around us every sickness every heartache everything that you endure having to go to a job having to go to the hospital what having to go to funerals everything that we we all this pollution that we see around us is what what was caused by by her thinking that she was right going off and thinking that she was right almost right is always wrong you you think about how that um you think about now God God coming down in the cool of the evening I'm I'm just going to try to just talk tonight that God coming down in the cool of the evening and brother around in one place he would say you know thunderings and Lightnings and lights and like it was like a a uh oh God's coming down he's coming down and he'd come down and then you see the light coming from the bushes or whatever the way that he would explain it and you think what kind of a process would have had to take for Eve to go out and say well instead of listening to this instead of listening to his word I'm going to listen to this to this to this Beast to the serpent who who you know the serpent was was turned into a serpent but he at first he was walking around on two two legs and and he could talk to her because he had a conversation that we just read and what kind of a process would it take for to some to get somebody into the State of Mind where they go listen to the man that was tilling and planting flowers out in your in your in front of your house or whatever and kind of your doing your yard work or whatever it might be the the doing the manual labor to go from listening to the man to to from a God that would come down in the cool of the Eden to evening to listening to the one that's supposed to be obeying you and and you see I see God had put them why why is it why is it a woman now a woman a woman has she's got a womb in her and she's got the ability now even even carry this on to typing typing a church typing the bride the woman has got a womb that she can receive she can receive from this man or from this man she's got a womb and so the woman has the has the ability to receive so so God had put the put in front of her he's got he's put in front of her the choice he's handed down the requirements to Adam and Eve don't do this oh my how many how many of us have we've handed down the requirements to our kids and to our family you you see your kids growing up and teenag to teenagers and or maybe you maybe you've uh husbands have have have handed down the requirements even to your wife and and things get messed up a little bit don't you can't wear clothes like that and when you see when the when the when the wife starts going off well I can do whatever I whatever I it you ain't telling me what to do then you get off off the track tell your kids that tell your kids that you can't you you don't need to be smoking pot you don't need to be smoking drinking alcohol because it's going to lead you down the road of Destruction and and as soon as you do you see it'll it'll sin will lead you farther than you ever want to go before long you've wound up on the side of the road with a cop at your door and and taking you to the jail house or you wound up in some bar with your arms wrapped around a a toilet and soaking on your own vomit and you you wind up in some kind of you wind up in come on let's be honest now tonight you wind up in a strange bear the next morning because sin will take you farther than you ever wanted to go all because you didn't you open you opened up your your womb your spiritual womb the womb of your mind to the wrong thing so God's telling God told Eve and Adam you can eat this but don't eat that cuz it'll kill you uh you you think about how many how many people today think that the that the the message that the gospel is just a bunch of rules to hurt you but the rules there there's rules there to keep to make you happy God has set rules in place to make you happy you know sometimes sometimes mama and daddy will set rules in place when they're when their little daughter is dating boys and things because they want they want to set boundaries for the happiness of their child so that one day she'll be able to enter in into a a marriage Union with a good man that will raise raise up a family and that she won't have to have some out of wedlock baby there or you know have have a whole a whole mess of background situation to deal with but you see all the rules and things are for happiness God has put these rules there for for for for you to be happy for you to be for you to be set up so you can serve him now now you see she she ate she ate the she ate she partook of the doctrine the the do the false doctrine of that the serpent was was was uh preaching to her you know in Proverbs Chapter 30 it says such as the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and say if I have and sayth I have done no wickedness uh the way of an adulterous woman now now we're going to maybe use some strong words tonight so just get set up we're going to use words like adultery and prostitution and because these words we we got to y'all we we got we got to use these to get the point across so just maybe grab the edge of your seat tonight and hang on because we're going to be talking about some some pointed facts now adultery what we want to get into tonight is what what is an adulterous Spirit adulterous the devil wants to anoint people God wants to anoint you and the devil wants to anoint you and the devil will anoint preachers the preachers with an adulterous spirit and maybe they ain't even in adultery but he'll he'll anoint them and what what is that the adulterous spirit is it it don't matter it don't matter you you're married to this man an adulterous woman you're married to this man but you think you start thinking because you're anointed of the devil you start thinking well it don't matter I can just go I can go fool around and if and you see the same thing when you're supposed to be married to Christ when you're supposed to be married to Christ and you're you're claiming his name and you go fooling around with all kind of false doctrines and saying that it doesn't matter that's the point I want to make tonight is it does matter see Eve thought that it didn't matter when she went around talking to the devil and well you know maybe you maybe this the serpent does have a better idea of it and she began to think that it just didn't matter she was going to go along with it such as the way of an adulterous woman it does matter it does matter if the doctor tells you not to eat all that fatty food and you go eat it anyway it matters and it matters if God told you not to eat something that's wrong and you go out and you do it anyway it matters wh why is it women though in Revelation 17 we find a woman and and it says and there came one of the seven Angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters the great with whom the kings of the Earth had committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth had been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the SP Spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet color Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of Harlot and Abominations of the earth here's a here's a woman Revelation is the book of symbols and all these things are symbolic of something so here's this here's a great the great that's the mother of of Harlot and and she's given all these nations to drink of the filthiness of the the cup of for fornications and brother B will go on to explain he said he said it said this woman was a that means that she was Ill feigned woman that she's supposed to be married to a husband and committed fornications with the world and she had she was a mother of Harlot therefore she had daughters I believe the Lord has perfectly laid it on the line that can't be nothing else but the Catholic church it's the only way it be and what did she give birth to the Protestant churches exactly she did you see you see this type that runs through it's a a woman a woman has a womb and in that womb she can receive she can receive uh and we're talking Doctrine here she can receive an idea and that idea that that thought is going to give birth to something now in this case this woman she received she received the devil's lie and she gave birth to all these Protestant churches oh you start thinking about women now now now let's get into practical practical talk now you think in your in your Christian Journey but all the times I'm not I'm not being beating on women or nothing amen but all the times that A Little Couple will come to church and the and the man will the he'll be like I I want to start getting tapes I want to start listening I want to hang around when the woman she'll go out of church and listen I'm I'm talking truth now I've seen this so many times the woman will say she'll stomp her feet say I ain't never darken in the door of that place before again and away they go and they won't never come back because the man he won't be like Adam now he won't have a backbone he won't stand up he won't be like a real man but he'll well I guess I guess I better do it oh God God wants real Christian men that when your wife won't dress right and when your wife won't do right that you stand strong and say well I'm I'm standing for the word of God you see you see that even the Christian the church is a type of a woman I'm that's why I'm not I'm not blasting on women tonight like people thought brother random did but but he's you know if you get a real the way a woman's supposed to be then it it the way the bride God wants the bride to be is is a reflection of himself an actual reflection of himself that she the woman's got a choice she can be she can be lower than a dog or she can be she can be the express image of God actually manifesting himself in flesh in this day or can degrade herself as you see it all depends on what she accepts because well well now I'm getting on marriage and divorce that that was just opening up to me fresh that so brother R would say what but you you think about that now you think about even going back to a woman you you think about brother Ram said the serpent seed came over in the ark now why how could it how could it do that now now this is I'm this is just my way of looking at it a woman's going to receive a woman the type of a of a church is going to receive that Doctrine and They Carried false Doctrine over that Ark and they cuz look look that's how it that's how it happens even even right maybe sitting here tonight you'll listen to the things that I'm saying and then the mother will go home and she'll start spreading stuff well I don't think I think it's okay if you go out and kiss some girl or something I don't think there's nothing wrong with that I don't think there be anything wrong at all with the way that you're wearing that those clothes I don't think there's nothing wrong and and go around the husband's back and and start saying all kind of stuff the man standing we need to have a standard but around around his back goes the woman to sew that false Doctrine to do the same thing that the serpent did to Eve down in the garden and and carried carried it over the ark carried over the ark into the new world oh you think you think it it don't matter though it don't matter see God said it mattered so much that he equated it with adultery with whoredom with fornications and those are strong words brother ra said what is a is a woman that's untrue to her marriage vow now the church the Catholic Church claims to be the bride and the wife of Christ even the nuns cut off their hair they cut off their hair but to show that they ain't you you you wear long hair why because of the Angels because you're going to show as a symbol I I've heard the word of the Lord I've heard with the ministers preaching so I'm going to wear my long hair because as a as a symbol that when I go to Walmart everybody's going to know I'm a Christian but the nuns they cut off their hair to show that I they ain't listening to who their true husband is they're going to listen to the to the false idea that they that that the devil has swn into their mind even the nuns cut off their hair and have no affections they're all affections to Christ is that right sure or anybody see see what what is a horse you can't tell me what's right a woman that wants stay true to her husband and go out and live with any old man that you think now now that's natural but what about in the spiritual somebody that won't stand true to the to her spiritual husband but'll go out there fooling around with the war fooling around with false doctrines I can believe I can believe what I want to ain't no preacher going to tell me I need to be born again ain't nobody going to tell me I need to come to church ain't nobody going to tell me how my family needs to be dressing and ain't nobody going to tell me the spiritual condition of my family or my household I can do what I want to do see what kind of spiritual condition you got a woman a is a woman that won't listen to her head that won't get under headship a woman God wants a bride that'll be so under headship that he can manifest himself through her so so under headship that she's doing exactly what he wants her to do even if the world laughs at her and mocks her and scoffs at her brother ra said to this seal of God he said you can't argue with the priest he won't argue cuz a priest a Catholic preach priest that woman he said if the church says anything different from this Bible the church is right see how he's putting that spiritually the woman the woman the church he saying the church is right not the man but the church to me the Bible is right and the church is wrong see you can't argue with them that there's no way of arguing there's no way of discussing or debating because they believe what the church says that's it what I say what what the woman says that's it is what the point he's making what the church says no matter what the Bible says it's what the church says they believe the church we believe the Bible and there's a streak of romanism that's mixed in every nation there is under Heaven through the Catholic church that's streak of romanism streak of romanism to permeate every fabric of societ society today that I can do I can do what I want to do and not the not the word of God the word of God becomes no more our standard that we live by but I can do whatever I want to and that makes you see almost right is always wrong you can come to church and you can go through all the all the outward appearance and pay your TI and everything and still be wrong cuz almost right is always wrong that's what the Bible's talking about that Isaiah prophesied back in in chapter 4 verse one he said in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we'll eat our own bread and we'll wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach and you've had them seven women all down through seven Church ages that that woman was was manifested in Paul's age I'mma do what I want to do I'mma just do I'mma do instead of taking the word of God I'm just going to take take my own ideas I'm going to take what the Catholic Church preaches I'm going to take take what my denomination says we'll eat our own bread and we'll wear our own apparel nobody's going to tell me how to dress I don't care what the Bible says only let us be called by thy name just let make as long as we can be called a Christian as long as I can come to church and sit in a church and and say I'm a Christian just so that'll take away our approach brother Brown said your boy goes with a Catholic girl when they go to get married they have to promise to raise the children vice versa see it's to break the power of the other to break the power but what is it the Bible claims the whole things a prostitute amen he says spiritual adultery y spiritual adultery that you profess to be a Christian and still living like the world well there's your definition of spiritual adultery I am a Christian when you say I'm a Christian but you're still going out there living living like the world doing doing you've taken in that wrong Doctrine taking the Creeds of man out here is man's Creeds and accepting them instead of the word that's committing a spiritual adultery against God and brother R said for whosoever shall take one word away from it or add one word to it it took away from it you're dead hybrid right there she's back here there testimony in her hands the filthiness of her fornications committing and spiritual adultery against the very word that she claims to believe what are you saying tonight brother B I'm saying it matters what you believe all these things matter what you believe it it matters when you go to a Minister's meeting and you hear things being said that that ain't right it matters when you go out to other churches or have here here somebody maybe come to this church and preach something little a a little bit off it matters now now listen see this is where you got to walk a tight rope it's like sometimes preaching is like it's like walking a walking a walking a a real narrow spot cuz you go too far to one side and you start casting people out and say I'm not going to fellowship with him and that's not what I'm preaching pring we we're all like brother Wade was say on Sunday we're trying to close in the gaps we're trying to fill in the Gap and you know you preach sometime you none of none of us believe what we did 20 years ago we've all got gaps that have been closed in so that's what we're trying to we're trying to close in the gaps but when you stop when you do when you stop and and and and Dole like Eve did and you receive the wrong thing and you hold that in it's going to produce something that's wrong that's what I'm talking about now brother said in the pergan church age he said I'll show Thee the Judgment of the great she was committing adultery well then if it was a church she was committing adultery against God then adultery would be fornications spiritual fornications she's teaching something to the people that's not God's word is that right she's teaching something that isn't true it matters it matters what you believe amen it matters what you believe I I love to sit down and talk to people about what they believe it seem today though like it's hard to get people to tell you what they believe I I you know I sat down I sit down I love I love to get preachers alone and sit down with them over over lunch or whatever but it's like pulling teeth to get somebody to tell you what they believe and when you do when you do get them to tell you what they believe they just about almost it almost creates conflict like what are we doing here I love to tell somebody what I believe if you if you believe something you going to you're going to be happy to share it I believe I believe we ought to know what we believe I don't I I don't believe we should be just like a a a weed in the field that's tossed every way every which way but we should we should be firm in what we believe we should be able to stand on something and be ready to share it that doesn't the scripture say always be ready to give an answer so brother of said in his spoken word is the Original Seed he said that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you know and better when you know him better by the word of God right now listen to this now by the Intercourse of the Mind right cuz that's where it all starts is it in your mind first that's where it started in Eve first before before she received it in in her natural womb she received it in the womb of her mind that's right by the Intercourse of the mind taking aive the devil against the word of God that's exactly what Eve done with a spiritual intercourse first that come by believ in Satan's lie into the womb of her mind that polluted her soul set death in the soul then the natural act taking place oh you see now why the greatest battle ever fought is such an important message cuz God's trying to arm Us in that message he talks about the fivefold ministry that God give us to put something in our hands so that we could have something to defend oursel from all the lies of the devil cuz God wants us to be shored up now don't start going to sleep on me now come on now listen I I believe that the bride should be entertained by the word what am I talking about tonight that we that God wants a bride that cares about the gospel enough that even when it's on Wednesday night you you want to get fed you cuz you want to it starts mattering you realize it matters what you believe we're not coming just to tonight to look at one another or to look at the preacher to be entertained by maybe some see how see how much the preacher can jump around and maybe he'll jump run up and down the aisle but we're com to be entertained by the word to receive something that'll give us Supernatural power and Supernatural strength in second Corinthians Paul said would the god you could bear with me a little in my father and indeed bear with me I wonder how much we can bear with the Folly of the preachers that maybe sometimes slip up and say things a little bit coarse and say things a little bit rough do a like Peter a little bit some maybe maybe go fishing and stuff and and and you know do do things maybe that that we don't think are all polished up and nice but Paul said for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ don't you want a gospel five-fold Ministry that'll have some love and care enough for you to preach the truth to you that won't hold back somebody that's jealous over you with a Godly jealousy that don't want to see you carried off with every wind of Doctrine and fou thing that the devil throws at you Paul said but I fear lest by any means there a spirit begal Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ Paul didn't want to see the Church of that day LED Away by all kinds of Tommy rck and I believe in this church we've got a five full ministry that don't want to see you led Away by a bunch of Tommy Rock we've got it preached pure we've got it preached and done adulterated I want to pass out some roast to tonight I believe we've got a five4 Ministry to be proud of here in this church for if he that cometh preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him I wonder how many preachers preachers down Through the Ages have had that same concern I I wonder if somebody comes and preaches something that's wrong are you just going to fall Hook Line and Sinker for it or maybe are you going to get so caught up in how the gospel is delivered that you want a preacher that that a preacher that knows what Fork to use at the dinner table whether the salad fork or whether this kind of fork a preacher that knows how how long to turn to the right hand side of the table before he turns to the left to continue his discussion or do you want something do you want to read That's tossed around about or do you want somebody that stands firm and knows what they believe listen it matters what is preached it matters what you believe the details matter don't don't you ever let the devil tell you it don't matter don't you ever let the devil tell you that it doesn't matter Doctrine matters Doctrine matters mat chap 5 he said think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one jot or one t shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled there ain't one little dot in this Bible going to pass away till the whole thing is fulfilled there's not one little comma going to pass away in the Bible till the whole thing is fulfilled everything has got to be believed because everything is going to be fulfilled and Eve polluted when she received the devil's lie she polluted the entire human race oh you think you think about what true Doctrine is this Doctrine now that's going around the message that well we you you already had eternal life in your soul when you were born the natural birth but this is contrary to that Doctrine you Eve polluted the whole thing her soul her her her her her wound well brother said that polluted her soul set death in the soul then the natural act taking place it polluted her womb it polluted everything it polluted what did it it polluted her thinking from then on the human race was not capable of thinking the right way that was not possible for God to inhabit the soul of the human being until God himself came down in flesh and made an Aton oh you you go out and look on the internet and look for for for for pictures of what pollution looks like there's rivers in India that they dumped trash in and this the trash is rolling by and there's the filth of humanity is rolling down the river until they can't even get clean drinking water out of it you got to look at the smoke stacks and we've got an office in Shanghai at work and Shanghai is so polluted that they can't even see the Sun during the day it's so polluted that they don't it's just a haze over the sky and that's the pollution that Eve called when she accepted the LIE of the devil the pollution of all these smoke stacks and filth of the world the pollution in the water the pollution everywhere our birth was polluted you didn't come this world the right way but you come polluted our world was polluted our thinking was polluted all because of a woman who thought she was right oh you think it don't matter what you believe you think it don't matter what kind of what you what you consume when you go out to listen to some other Church you think about what everywhere you go is a symbol and a sign of what the consequences of somebody disagreeing disbelieving with God's word brother would say show me one place in the Bible after what Eve did show me one place in the Bible that I God ever ordained any woman to preach or take authority over a man it matters show me one place where God ever ordained it denomination Y show me one place where God ever ordained a woman preacher show me one place where God ever ordained sprinklin show me one place where God ever ordained poring show me one place I'm I've collected all these things that brother R said show me one place where God ever had anybody baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost show me one place where anybody was ever healed outside of Divine Healing show me one time Jesus called merry mother show me one time God changes he doesn't show me one place that he failed to prove that he wasn't God show me one scripture where Peter ever was in Rome or any history that says he was show me one scripture where it ever say an Apple started the thing are going now I want you to show me that they eat apples it matters it matters what you believe that's it matters what you receive why does it matter because you you have you got a womb as a spiritual the spiritual church you've got a womb and as you receive whatever you receive you're going to produce a baby Eve receive that lie of the devil and before long she was holding that baby and you know a few few chapters later there she is with her confession I I I've gotten a man from the Lord and it was a man from the Lord because all life comes from God but I now I believe that she was she was the way the spirit that she was saying is look at me look at me it turned out all right after all and people dying all around her the rivers begin to get polluted and there she was confessing that she was still right just like the churches today just like people around the message you can preach and pre this is this is a preacher's dilemma you can preach and preach and preach your heart out but there's still going to be unbelievers and make Believers and True Believers no matter how hard you preach you there's going to be there's going to be unbelievers until the day that the Rapture takes place and that's something I know that it gev every true minister of God cuz you want to go out and grab somebody by the lapel and bring them to the Altar and force them to praise pray through but it just don't work like that oh I I wish don't you don't you just wish you could do your family like that you say we got new light on it no you haven't that's what the devil come to Eve with some new light don't need new no new light you need to walk in the light that God is already put here that's all that's that's what we need that's what brother I'm saying in that message of serpent seed he's saying we don't need our own carnal understanding or what some false preachers preach to us but what will give us overcoming power is revelation Revelation light would Jesus come and ask Peter whom do men say that I the son of Son of Man am who do you say that I am and Peter answered back Thou Art the Christ that they all tie that back to when Abel come out of the garden he knew there was a way back and go God revealed it to him that it was blood that it come the fall come by Blood and there had to be blood to cover the whole thing over and he come dragging that animal up to sacrifice it because God had revealed it to him and when God reveals to you that you're saved or God reveals to you that he's filled you with the Holy Ghost that that takes care of everything there're on the there on the day of Pentecost Peter come out and he wasn't speaking by man's understanding or some carnal intellectual idea but he said when they asked him men and Brethren what should we do and he tied it all together because God had G Jesus had given him the keys and he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he had the key what's the keys the keys is the revelation of Jesus Christ and the revelation of Jesus Christ to you will open up every door every obstacle it'll clear the way it'll overcome everything that the devil can throw at you Matthew chapter 16 he said I'll give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shut loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven do you believe that tonight that that that the Bride of Jesus Christ has those same keys that the if the the revelation of Jesus Christ is preached it will loose you from your sins it will loose you from what the devil's got bound but if you turn it down it'll bind you it'll leave you bound it'll leave you in that same situation cuz you have a womb got a womb to be able to receive or reject the revelation of Jesus Christ will open Heaven the revelation of Jesus Christ will set you free Jesus Christ is the truth don't we all want truth how many times have we preached what a great blessing to somebody for somebody to stare you in the face and tell you the truth what a great blessing for somebody it was a blessing when Jesus told that little woman he said it's not given to dogs what's what's her reaction going to be many times he wants to test your reaction to see how bad do you want it when when when Jesus come out and was preaching you bunch of vipers well you saw what their reaction was you Snakes in the Grass when John the Baptist said to acts is lead of the root of the tree many times the gospel is preached a little bit hard but God wants to see God wants to see what your reaction is how bad do you want it how bad do you want it brother Raam said I can show you where Jesus Christ give power to the church to heal the sick and raise the dead and cast out Devils I challenge any man to showed me a scripture in the Bible where he took it away from the church what took it away what took it what what took it away you say well I don't see a lot of thing going on in church I don't they see anything going on in my life why not what took it away he said your own Dogma right not God's word the Holy Spirit still getting the job done going right on just the same and he will forever and I I I want to maybe maybe challenge you tonight if you don't see the power of God moving in your own life then maybe tonight when you get home in the steal of the night get along with God in your in your little prayer closet and and ask him ask him like Elisha did there at that River when he slapped that water with with Elijah's coat and he said where is the god of Elijah I know God's got to be on the scene somewhere if other people are receiving the Holy Ghost if other people can receive that same quickening power then where is it I wanton some of it and God will come on the scene if you get rid of all your old dogma and start start aligning your your thinking and aligning your thoughts with the word of God and start thinking what God already said something will begin to take place brother said in the serpent seat he said Along come to Oneness and found out the baptism in jesus' name they said oh we got it they organized what they do God just moved right out and left him sitting there it's for whosoever will let him come the Oneness can't go to the assemblies and the assemblies can't go to the Oneness he said I said how can you teach that inial initial evidence as a scholar and they said well said brother brandham one two or three of them was real honest we know that's wrong but what can we do if we say anything about it why it'll interrupt the whole program and there's when you sold out right for money Y and we said brother I'd rather have me a little mission on the corner or preach under a pine tree and have the truth certainly I know that you are telling the truth man wants the truth and you're obligated as a Christian to Bear forth the record of Truth did you know that that you're obligated as a Christian to Bear forth a record of Truth God's going to hold you responsible for it God's going to hold you responsible for it we were s we were sitting around I'm going to name name some names here in in a second as I tell this story we were sitting around the other night and we were somebody was telling us about a brother that used to go up to brother Tim Humes his church and he'd go up and he'd say he say I I know something's wrong in my life but I I I want the baptism of holy I want to be born again and he never could get an answer now now let's be honest L you know we say well we ar supposed to name names and everything but come on now you you got to be born again to be able to give somebody to be able to tell somebody how to be born again now how how many of you maybe maybe tonight you you want to be born again this this is the place to come to be born again cuz we've got the recipe and I I speak I speak boldly Maybe maybe I speak like Paul tonight we we know we know how to be born again if you want to be born again you come up to the Altar and and we'll pray through with you we'll instruct you on how to do it because because why we we we got the truth I believe we've got the truth we've got a group of people here who know the truth we got a group of people here who want the truth so when you come to church here and you hear the truth preached you see God wants to see your reaction to the truth how much do you want it when when that man in the Bible that Jesus talked about found that pearl of great price what did he do he sold everything to get that pearl of great price and and and a pearl is equated with wisdom there's a lot of pearls that people can tell you how to be how to be financially successful how to be a good person all this kind of stuff but this Pearl is how to have eternal life and it's worth everything it's worth your pride it's worth your ego it's worth laying down all of your self-will it's worth Lay It selling everything that you got to get this pearl of great price it's worth it's worth coming to church for it's worth getting preached on for it's worth grabbing the Pew while you're getting preached on and saying on me until something begins to break loose it's enough it's it's enough to get spat on like David going up that mountain it's enough to get spat on like Jesus and struck on the side of the head it's worth enough to be humiliated for you see people come around the gospel and they don't they don't want to pay the price they don't want to be humiliated enough they don't want to they don't want to give nothing for it you don't get this oh you get it for free but you still got to give yourself you got to give yourself wheel you got to give your pride you got to lay it all down on the altar cause it's worth it all this it's worth somebody saying something rude to you at church it's worth somebody saying something that they polished up oh oh the brother said listen the truth is the truth is you were born polluted and you need the Holy Ghost you need the holy you need the Holy Ghost to be able to withstand when somebody says something rude to you you need the Holy Ghost and if you don't have the Holy Ghost the truth of the matter is the truth is you're going to hell without it have we has the message ranked stopped preaching about Sin and about going to hell there we don't you know we say we don't want to do like a Baptist and dangle you over hell but the truth of the matter is if you're not saved you're going to hell there is a hell and we don't believe in in Eternal suffering because there's only one form of eternal life and if you don't have God's eternal life then you're going one day your soul will die it'll pet her out he said the only way you know you got it was when your spirit Bears record with his Spirit and the fruits of the spirit follow you love Faith joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentl that's when you know you got the Holy Ghost sir it bearss record of itself yes the truth the truth is that if you don't enjoy hearing the word you're not born again if you don't enjoy coming to church you're not born again if you don't enjoy if you don't enjoy looking at the Bible and reading it then you're not born again if you're if you're living in the world the love of the father is not even in you if you're living in the world then you're not born again come on now let's lay it out on the table you're not born again it and you need to be let's let's scream it like Noah did at the ark the day before the rain first fell because the ark surely the ark is closing surely you can see that we're at the closing time so come on into the ark come on in before it's too late you need to be born again you need to be saved don't get offended don't get your feelings hurt but because I'm preaching eternal life to you I'm preaching something that'll save your soul that's worth more than all your hurt feelings and more all all the stuff you want to cabbage down with if you'd rather be watching a movie than worshiping God you're not born again if you'd rather be at the pool hall than reading your Bible you're not born again if you'd rather be clowning around with the world than going through a prayer line or worshiping with his Saints you're not born again the Bible says that the angel went through the midst of the city and set a mark upon the foreheads of the man that sighed and that cried for all the Abominations that should be done that be done in the midst thereof and brother R would ask that question how many if you go ask all these Pentecostal preachers how many people in your church are sighing and crying how many people care how many people care about what's preached I remember back in the old days when we'd come to church and brother brother Dale would talk about all the calls that he would get about questions and whatnot do do we still now you see there was maybe a lot of contention back then and people arguing about stuff but but you know they cared do we still care enough do we care enough to have questions that we need answered do we care enough that to that when somebody preaches something that we go home and study it out or or we just ambivalent well it don't matter what I believe but it does matter what you believe it matters what you believe because if you don't believe the right thing then you'll die I'm not talking about spiritual well it could be spiritual could be either one yeah there you go either Nei one brother said in Abraham's Covenant confirmed when all these sins begin to get like that in the days of Sodom women half naked running through the rooms off the hotels and Men drunk falling behind them that ain't off somewhere else that's here and then what happened God said I've come down to find out whether all these reports are true the true children crying out come Lord Jesus how many true children we do we have tonight maybe I wonder now now it ain't you can't answer that question by raising your hand because may maybe many hands will be raised that ain't really sighing and crying that don't really care anymore but the true children are be going going to be crying out cuz why they what are they crying out for they want all the gaps to be filled in what are they crying out they look out and they see the gaps not filled in in other people's lives and they want those gaps to be filled in what do you well when you surely the ministers when you go out to a ministers meeting and see the Calamity that some people the the way some people are preaching doesn't that make you want to cry out oh God surely Lord Lord you got to help us and he brother said as we asked the other night as the Holy Spirit told us in the Bible only seal those who sigh and cry for the Abominations did in the city where would they be sealed where is the sealing of the people let's not be deceived let's be right amen we want to be right don't we right amen and almost most right is always wrong that's if you're almost right if you're almost in the holy of holies you you ain't got it yet if you're almost saved you're not saved yet if you're almost on home plate you ain't you ain't made the score yet if you're almost there you ain't got it yet now how did it start brother said God made the man out of the earth and then if you want this is a really interesting quote and the serpent se he said years and years after he made Adam years and years and years passed and the man didn't look quite right by himself so God put him to sleep and he made a woman out of a rib now you go study out a rib online it's very it's oh there's a rabbit Trail we could go down but a rib actually has a head and a neck and a body in that straight even a doctor will tell you a rib has a head and a neck and a body go look at that if you want that's that's free and brother R said a woman is just part of a man and when a man takes to himself a wife and if she's correctly his wife a god-given wife she'll be just to him as part of him amen he said there's the reason you got so many Scruples in marriage cuz you're not part of one another that's right in other words you don't you don't really love one another when you got you got all these Scruples in marriage he's talking about what he's talking about is when you get married and the the woman starts getting older and the man looks at her and like you got now you got maybe yellow teeth and you got saggy a little bit and and uh maybe you know your hair doesn't com there's some white in your hair and and you don't look the way but see he's talking about love when you love one another and and when you love your wife and she loves you back and you're in agreement and and oh my there's peace in your home and you're both Christians and you're in a one Court about how to raise your children we want to have a Godly home you don't want to kick that woman out like like people in the message got off scrupled up if my if my wife don't want to have me a child I'm just going to boot her out or What About Love What about love love that's why brother R said you ought to pray first pray first before you enter into these things CU a woman is part of you and this man when he was created God separated his spirit and he took a piece off the man his side and made a woman out of it and then he took the feminist daning Spirit of the man and made a woman out of it and he made the man masculine Burly oh you think about how brother Ram described Adam walking around in the Garden of Eden now he was a real man he said he said he he had a big black beard that come down and come maybe down to here yes he did y'all don't be frowning at me now he said it he had a black beard that come down and he had that long hair that that come down to his shoulders and you think oh you think you you go look online to see a pictures of a model with a with a big beard or whatever that don't compare nothing to how Adam looked he was a real man he was somebody that that knew how to run his household he knew he knew how when when when the wind wasn't blowing right he he didn't he wanted everything to just be perfect he speak to the wind and speak to the mountain to move it out of the way so it wouldn't so maybe it block the son so his wife could get a little a little rest or whatever this is coming fresh and brother R said when you see a man that's little you know manicure in his fingernails and slicking his hair down and holding his mouth open in front and such stuff as that one of these pretty boys you just remember sis there's something wrong with that bird why cuz God wants a woman to look like a woman and a man to look like a man and when you get off of that he said you're something wrong you better keep an eye on it God wants you to be a young man he wants you to be a real man and you young ladies you you look for a real man somebody that will know how to run his home according to God's plan let the we want the difference to be real clear I want we I want somebody to know that I'm a Christian I want somebody to be able to tell that I'm a Christian I don't want somebody to think that I'm towing up against the line and see how close I can get but I want the difference to be be real clear and God wants to see real men and women that ain't Towing up against the line he wants to see a real man that's not seeing how close to looking like a woman he can get but wearing some kind of carrying some kind of pocketbook looking thing around or carrying some letting his hair hang down in his eyes but he want God wants a man that looks like a man and brother R said Adam was the handsomest man that ever lived and Eve was a perfect woman in every way in one place he said the star look like the stars were shin sh In Her Eyes The Starlight you think about you think about what you would imagine a beautiful woman to look like today but Eve was far beyond that because God when God does something he does it right and I believe God Adam was a real man a man that would handle you know that's what a man is a man handles stuff a man don't make his make his wife go out and and do all the all all the all the all the get on the phone and do all the things but he handles stuff he goes and takes the car to the mechanic or does the changes the old himself he he does all that stuff cuz he that's what a man does is he handles stuff Adam handled Adam handled naming the animals he handled rearranging the mountains he handled providing he handled Pro protecting he handled loving and Adam wouldn't have put up with none of the Serpent's nonsense that's why the serpent had to get Eve away cuz he knew Adam was a real man Adam standing there in the garden with his big broad shoulders and his big chest and that beard come down and his hair oh he was a a model of what a man is not some kind of and the serpent had to get the woman away and said yay hath God said ye shall not eat of the tree of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may I know it seems like I'm going to be long tonight but I'm not I'm we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden and gotha said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God do know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil why would you want to know evil that's a lie that the devil Tells A lot of these young kids You Come Away with me and I'll show you a good time come to this nightclub come to this bar drink some of this alcohol smoke some of this weed and I'll show you a good time and then you then you really do have some knowledge of Good and Evil you know with the prophecy of of Isaiah about Jesus said butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good now there's something you can study out what's butter and honey butter is butter is the word and the and and honey is the law of the Lord and you you meditate on the word of God and his law and then you'll know how to refuse the evil and choose the good God wants you to stay away from the evil amen right amen your Doctrine matters amen correct understanding matters that's why it's so important to know what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what the new birth is how to be born again that God can take you through a process of his works of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God you believe and you begin to turn aside and then God cleans you out and kicks that unclean Spirit out of you and then Fe fills you with his Spirit after you had a chance to study and meditate on the word a little bit through a sanctification process adoption false anointed ones what a false anointed one is the godhead the third pool the Seven Seals all these things are important don't let the devil never put in your mind that it's not important that you don't need these things because this is what Shores up a real believer there is a right and a wrong and almost right is always wrong oh you think about that story in the Bible when the ephraimites came up to that River to cross over into Gilead y'all ha we been just a little bit longer y'all actually doing really good tonight I don't know if it's my preaching or what maybe maybe it's all right the ephraimites came up to the river and and they had to they had to answer that question say shth now if they didn't say it right almost right was wrong and almost right was going to get your going to get you a sword through your heart and if they if they didn't say it right now now see they could try real hard to say to shth but if they couldn't frame it right because they were from a different part of the country because of their accent they would say cilith instead of shth and then they died cuz almost right is always wrong see it matters it matters what you believe amen oh it matters when you hear somebody say well you always had eternal life and and I'm just going to lay some of these things down and when we'll close it we'll close in just a moment it matters when someone when you hear somebody say Jesus didn't have the Holy Ghost until the River Jordan he went all these years without the Holy Ghost now we not pitting people out but it matters it matters how who you believe Jesus is it matters the new it matters when somebody said the new birth is you you was when you just realize that you already were Eternal it it matters cuz that's wrong it's not just you realizing at that moment that you already had the new birth in you it matters when you hear somebody say well we're already in the Millennium no we're not in the Millennium cuz I thought Satan Satan is supposed to be bound for a thousand years when we're in the Millennium it matters when you hear somebody say well you don't need to assemble with other believers it matters cuz the Bible says that we do need to and you get a blessing when you come to church and gather together with other believers you get a blessing it matters when you hear somebody say well I can just get it for myself listen I need some help I don't know about y'all but I need some help if somebody somebody that's kind of gone up the ladder a little bit going up Jacob's Ladder and climbed a few rungs I can sit under them for a little bit and get some get some words of wisdom and get some help oh it matters when somebody says well we only needed a five full when they twist Ephesians 4:11 and said we only needed a fivefold Ministry until a prophet came and then we don't need it anymore because now we got the full word it matters because that's not right that's not what Ephesians 4:11 is saying it matters when somebody says well I'm born again cuz my mama said I was it matters yeah cuz you ain't born again just cause your mama said you all right you ain't born again just cuz your mama says that you ought to be offended at the preaching you ain't born again when somebody says you don't need to mature and Don't Preach growth that ain't right and it matters it surely does matter it matters when somebody says you get it all when you believe now just sit down and wait at the bus stop it matters and that ain't right aren't you glad for the truth tonight aren't you glad to be sitting in a Church where the spirit moves where the where the truth has been preached for all these years oh another story we'll just we'll just relate just for a second what you know when when Paul got got hauled in front of a king Agrippa there Agrippa and fesus were sitting up there and Paul got a chance to tell tell tell his testimony and Paul got he started lighting letting loose and he got to where Jesus died and and rose again and fester sprung up and he said Paul you you touched in the head you're crazy when he started talking about the resurrection power Festa jumped up and said you crazy Paul so Paul turned his attention from Festa and he started talking to a grippa and he said then Agrippa said unto Paul almost he started he started telling Agrippa he said surely you agree with what I'm telling you surely you believe the prophets he he started appealing to agrippa's knowledge of all these things that he was talking about the history in the context and and Agrippa said unto Paul almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian mhm and Paul said I would to God that not only thou but also that all hear me this day with both almost and all together such as I am except these bonds the musicians can go ahead and come forward don't stop it almost don't don't stop it almost cuz almost ain't good enough almost right is always wrong don't almost save ain't saved almost born again and Born Again almost free is not free and almost sober is not sober almost clean it's still dirty almost right is always wrong the Serpent's lie was almost right let's stand to our feet and worship God we just got we've got a husband that if we'll stay with him a spiritual husband we'll stay with the word and God will carry us all the way through you love the Lord tonight you want Christ you want truth let's worship him a little bit thank you Lord [Music] they call him Jesus he and [Music] for he and to my and to prove my saor Because He [Music] Lives I Can Face toor all fear is [Music] gone I know yes I know he holds my my fut my life is worth the living because he live and there [Music] cross the [Music] river change way Victory I'll see the lights of glory and I know he Liv Because He Lives I Can Face tomorrow because he lives all fear is gone I know yes I know he holds my future life is worth living just because amen aren't you glad he went all the way for you he didn't just go halfway he didn't go all most to the Cross but he went all the way to the Cross so that we could go all the way to eternal life you love him tonight we'll just you got something to say don't you will yeah I'm done let's give our brother big hand y'all don't have to be mad at me anymore you can be mad at him somebody said he called me a buzzard somebody said he called me an eagle which one did you figure out out you were tonight come on amen that's right cuz there is a womb that's filled with the Holy Ghost there is a womb that's filled with the devil right amen and you got to choose which one you want that's right and we can't we don't need to soft soap it anymore amen like I was saying Sunday if you're lost you're lost and if you die you're going to hell do you know I was thinking yesterday 120 years Noah preached that it's going to rain and I'll I I'll I'll we'll meet Noah and we'll ask him but I'll bet Noah on the day God got ready to shut the ark he said God give me one more day sure I've got other family members come on that I need to get in this Ark I've got maybe in-laws I've got cousins I've got uncles I've got aunts God said get in the ark oh man right that's right Noah said Lord what no Noah get in the ark you preached 120 years and they ain't nobody going to listen to what you say no more if I give them another hundred years so you can't blame Noah that's you can't blame Noah for those deaths brother rown said is as many now then as it was now so 7 billion people died under 120 years do you know we've had half that since the prophet left we've had 60 years of preaching up the end of of his sermon end of his life we've had 60 years almost half that 120 years to get ready so you can't blame Noah can't blame the preacher right God shut the door God said that's enough and I believe that's what the ministry is telling us now it's time to quit fooling around time to get busy amen amen Noah no God one nope Noah sorry they ain't no more coming in get in the ark be careful you know what how many times have brother Dale told us that and brother brother brandham told us it was parental delinquency not that's right children delinquency that's it right right why did those she bears eat those children because the children talked against Elisha called him an old ball head well you know what they didn't know nothing probably some of them kids were little tiny kids that didn't even know what Baldhead meant right but sitting around your living room come on and what you say to your kids come on I see it about what happens e this church or message or whatever it's exactly it ain't their fault it's yours amen that's

call brother Tim h his name I got a WhatsApp from him asking how I was doing and asking how brother Dale was doing and inviting us to a meeting so we converse for a few minutes so I haven't quit praying for those people that's right I have not quit praying brother brandham said I I think I read the quote several months ago he said if you're not willing to go get that person that you need to be in the altar that's right let God shut the door we not going to shut the door amen so if they want to fellowship with I'm not going to fellowship with no Noone their Doctrine but I'll sure shake his hand and call him brother Amen brother R him did he shook his hand called him brother call he said I'll call the pop brother right any what he said he said I'm not going to kiss his ring but I'll call him brother amen so just pray for those Brothers I do I pray for them every night amen for those brothers that are that have U um basically got an evil spirit on them maybe not so much turned the message down but got a spirit on them and and we can see that that brother R told us that even that brother Ramsey said I'm not serving the lord no more I'm going to go out and just start drinking and not come to church anymore and you know what brother R said he said about 6 months later he was dead cuz God took him off the scene cuz he didn't want to Mar his name he took his he took his child home so he must have been born again took his child home right so he wouldn't Mar his name so we we're praying for that group of people that are that are against the message of the hour and uh but we want to press on and be the message of the hour we don't want to just no we want to be it amen there's somebody going to be it somebody's going to be there we're just praying that we all going to be there and we're all and and like Bob said I I'm not going to apologize for what I said Sunday there was some people might got offended for calling the name I call but my Lord if you don't want your kid saved there's something wrong with you s you're right sister there's something wrong with you if you don't want your children children saved and filled with the Holy Ghost I don't want mine just to make it on a deathbed confession that's right now maybe that that's okay but I want them in this church I want them to be I want them to be involved natural amen if we have to build another church so we will build another church I don't care but I want them involved I don't want them to just make it by the skin of their teeth come on I don't want them to be involved I want to have young ministers I want to have young sisters that can play the instruments again and again and again amen that's what I want I want somebody to say amen amen not just make it by the Skin of Their Teeth Now some might but that's okay but I want somebody to be like brother Bob said I I'm fill those gaps in cuz you know if there's a gap that was Eve's problem there was a gap in Eve that's right she didn't believe in Hebrews 13:8 brother Brown said that's where she missed it right not that God wasn't God because she couldn't deny that cuz she met him every day but there was a gap in there that Satan stuck that peg in and said I I got you now am well that's what we're trying to do I believe we're screaming out trying to get people in the ark but remember it was 7 days before it started raining right so Noah had to mature a little bit while he was sitting in that Ark Waiting for God to cap off what he had preached yes and we pray that that I was thinking about this other day what brother Dale has been preaching for all these years I pray that God will kept that thing off Amen in a group of people in us it's not going to matter if it just stays on tape or stays in a book or or goes through the airwaves it's got to come inside of me and you and then we got to live it out and I believe we can I Bob I believe we got a FF Ministry that can take us on that's right to the coming of the Lord amen it's not none of this is none of this has been in vain it's all had a purpose it's all had a plan it's all had its time and I believe we're in the time now to where like I said before we're screaming out get in the ark yes right cuz God's getting ready to shut the door remember remember the third pull is to the totally lost that's right that can't ever be saved but it's also to the bride it's also to the church but it is to the totally lost Jesus went and preached to the souls in prison no way they could be saved because they sended away their day of Grace amen listen we're one day closer to the Rapture Believe It or Not amen where whenever it comes we have become one day from yesterday we're one day closer right every Sunday we get seven days closer yes right to the Rapture seven days closer man I'm talking about you how how long it was January a couple of weeks ago it's September now it'll be Christmas in two days right amen remember when you was growing up you thought Christmas you know man Christmas is comes every about over 3 years it comes every 3 months now but you know what God is accelerating our time if you love it here you going to stay here I don't love it here no more uhuh we ought to be called out am to where we're so miserable to have to do the things of this world that we even have to do as Christians in this thing we want to get out of this thing amen pray for me on Tuesday I'm going to have an MRI like I said before I got all this tingling in my face and and U it feels like electric shocks are going off inside my head maybe I'm having some shock treatment from the Lord but I don't know it may be from the devil I want to know which one but we're going to go Tuesday and have a have an MRI done so just keep us in prayer keep the reads in prayer they're leaving Saturday going back to Canada and then sister Fran's going on back to to Jamaica I'm sure Keith has missed her severely they talk every night all the time just like they married two weeks ago makes you sick so anyway no it doesn't cuz you see the smile on her face when Keith Keith when Keith's talking to her so and that's true love amen be so many miles apart and still be in love so God bless you um going to help us Saturday we know we've got plenty enough dessert we need some servers um drinks and Ice we'll I I'll talk to somebody about that but I'll try to get them myself but the pizza we're going to have to brother Luis is going to go get it but we'll kind of figure out I between now and then where we're going to get it from amen so you love the Lord let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this time that you give us thank you for the words that you give us Lord whether they be harsh you said in the Book of Revelations that oh it was so sweet when you ate that book when John ate the book it was oh it's like honey but boy when it hit his belly and he had to live what was in that book it became bitter because we are contrary as I've been preaching we need a renewing of our mind to get away from this contrariness from this false Doctrine from this false security that that as what I was thinking the other day lord it's just like the denominations they they don't even preach on Hell anymore because God's such a good God that everybody's going to heaven well that's not going to happen you're a good God but you're a just God yes and you said if you believe on me the works that I do will you do also and if you believe in me I'll give you everlasting life but if you don't there will be torment Lord I pray that you'd save us save everyone Lord that we come in contact with Lord may we be a light that shines on all the people whether we go to work as brother Bob says I want people to know I'm different I want people to know I'm a Christian that when they need something as we're talking about we'll come up to the virtue there that virtue is strength it's something something somebody can pull from we want somebody to be able to pull strength from what we say and for what we do Lord I pray that you'd be with us Lord as we continue on Lord as we go home Lord that you'll be with us as the wheels turn some have to go a little bit further than others father we pray that you just be with us this weekend be with brother Ronnie and his family they're driving down Friday that we'll have a wonderful time in you Lord and that you'll be with us and and save souls and filling with the Holy Ghost and make us better Christians Lord that's why we're here we thank you for all things we give you praise and honor and glory in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you're [Music] dismissed
