[18:08] subtitle it cometh hither
[18:11] amen Matthew chapter 22 he kind of tells
[18:14] it in a in in a little bit of a
[18:16] different variation he says and Jesus
[18:18] answered and spake unto them by again by
[18:21] Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven
[18:23] is likened to a certain King which made
[18:25] a marriage for his son and he sent forth
[18:27] servants to all of them went Bing to the
[18:29] wedding that they would not come and
[18:33] they would not come and again he sent
[18:35] forth other servants saying tell them
[18:38] which were bidden behold I have prepared
[18:40] my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are
[18:43] killed and all the things are ready come
[18:45] un the marriage and they made light of
[18:48] it
[18:50] yeah and went their ways one to his farm
[18:53] and another to his
[18:55] merchandise and the remnant took his
[18:57] servants and in treated them spitefully
[18:59] and slew them but when the king heard
[19:03] thereof he was wroth and he sent for
[19:06] these armies and destroyed those
[19:08] murderers and burned up their city and
[19:12] then said he to his servants the wedding
[19:15] is ready but they which were bed were
[19:19] not worthy right go you therefore into
[19:21] the highways and as many as you shall
[19:23] find bid to the marriage and those
[19:26] servants went out to the highways and
[19:27] gathered together as many as they found
[19:29] both bad and good so we fit it right
[19:32] there we fit it right there all of us
[19:35] fit right in you'll find the scripture
[19:37] where you really fit in there's where
[19:39] you really fit in both bad and
[19:43] good Hallelujah so you know what you get
[19:45] right off the
[19:48] bat the wedding is ready but they were
[19:50] bitten were not worthy and he and and
[19:53] not notice how he says and those
[19:55] servants went on the highways and
[19:56] gathered as many as they found book bag
[19:58] and good and the wedding was furnished
[20:00] with guests and when the king came to
[20:03] see into see the guest he saw there a
[20:05] man which had not on the wedding garment
[20:09] and he said unto him friend now notice
[20:12] how he addresses him friend right how
[20:15] camest thou in hither not having on a
[20:19] wedding garment yeah and he was
[20:21] speechless right notice the statement he
[20:24] was speechless right M then said the
[20:27] king to his servants bind him hand and
[20:30] foot and take him away and cast him into
[20:33] outer Darkness there shall be weeping
[20:36] and nashing of teeth and then he began
[20:39] to say it like this for many are called
[20:42] right
[20:43] amen but few are chosen amen that's
[20:46] right Revelations chapter 3 and I I I
[20:49] just I just want to share some
[20:51] scriptures with you this afternoon
[20:53] Revelation 3 and: 18 notice this is to
[20:56] our age and he says I count counsel them
[20:59] and listen I I want to find God's
[21:02] counsel I I'm not so I'm not so
[21:05] concerned with men's counsel I I I
[21:07] definitely want to please God cuz
[21:09] there's a lot of things I can't please
[21:11] and a lot of men I can't please and cuz
[21:13] I can't please myself to be honest with
[21:15] you I counsel of thee to buy of me gold
[21:20] tried in the fire that thou may be rich
[21:24] and in white reignment that thou mayest
[21:26] be clothed right and that the shame of
[21:29] thy nakedness do not appear GL and
[21:32] anoint thine eyes with ISAC that thou
[21:35] may see right right and as many as I
[21:38] love I rebuke and Chas it be zelous
[21:41] therefore and repent right notice how he
[21:43] says it behold I stand at the door and
[21:45] knock this age God came to this place
[21:49] and he be to knock behold I stand and
[21:52] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[21:56] open the door I will come into him and
[21:59] will s with him and he with me and to
[22:01] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[22:04] with me in my throne even as I also
[22:07] overcame and was sat down with my father
[22:10] in his throne amen amen that's right oh
[22:13] don't you love the Lord this good to us
[22:15] that's right now now I I I very I very
[22:19] much realized when when Jesus was here
[22:22] he told a couple different types of
[22:23] invitations but there was a day one time
[22:27] when he was standing on the hillside
[22:29] brother R said a courier had went out
[22:31] and right he had be to try to he had
[22:34] been set by his by his head of the
[22:36] Master of the House to go and find this
[22:40] Jesus and he had made a huge feast and
[22:43] he was going to have in all the
[22:44] dignitaries and he was going to have in
[22:46] all of the people that was the
[22:47] well-known of society but he was also
[22:50] going to invite Jesus to purposely make
[22:53] fun of him and so brother Brandon will
[22:56] use this in several different occasions
[22:58] and and he went and this man he he
[23:01] begins to explain this man he says he
[23:03] looked high and low and he looked he
[23:05] looked at the hills he looked at the
[23:06] different places and he finally found
[23:08] Jesus and Jesus was having a meeting no
[23:12] doubt no doubt as as even brother brand
[23:15] says he he came and he says he said they
[23:18] tried to get to him but the disciples
[23:20] stopped
[23:21] him and they didn't want him to get to
[23:23] Jesus and no doubt they even thought and
[23:25] I'll just add a few things here no doubt
[23:27] they begin to think no way would Jesus
[23:30] go to this man's house right no way
[23:33] would he go to his house he's invited
[23:36] but no way would he go and show up at
[23:38] Simon's house but Jesus was not going
[23:41] for
[23:43] Simon exactly he would accept the
[23:46] invitation because he always goes where
[23:48] he's
[23:50] invited and so when he was invited to go
[23:54] they they didn't provide a robe for him
[23:56] they didn't provide a the the the
[23:58] perfume for him or they didn't wash his
[24:01] feet and he walked right among the
[24:03] dignitaries and and there he said in the
[24:06] unwelcome Corner if you might say and
[24:09] and and some said he was sitting on the
[24:11] bench some said he sitting on the floor
[24:13] it doesn't matter but but let me just
[24:14] say this to you he was sitting there no
[24:17] doubt able to read their minds
[24:20] exactly exactly amen no doubt able to
[24:23] see in the the chambers of their hearts
[24:27] exactly he can do that with the woman at
[24:29] to well knowing exactly if he can do
[24:31] that with the Pharisees and the
[24:32] Sadducees here he said in a room and he
[24:35] and he sitting there
[24:37] and would allow his own gift to operate
[24:40] he could he could look through their
[24:41] their righteous
[24:43] ropes and he could see what was going on
[24:45] the chambers of their
[24:47] hearts yes no doubt they call themselves
[24:50] righteous and
[24:52] religious amen we're not careful that's
[24:54] all we'll have right exactly all we'll
[24:58] be invited to the wedding Feast but we
[25:01] we will only want to come so far oh yeah
[25:04] and and you know we'll get a we'll get a
[25:05] new spirit we'll go to church and we'll
[25:09] sit on a Pew and we'll we'll sit there
[25:12] and we'll absorb the message and and we
[25:14] will even get the pastor's
[25:16] Spirit we'll even get maybe our favorite
[25:19] person in Church's spirit and we'll
[25:22] begin to conform to how the church
[25:24] operates how everything is happening we
[25:27] and before long we'll begin to listen to
[25:30] Tes and we'll come to church and we'll
[25:32] get a message lyrics come on and we'll
[25:36] get everything down just right we'll get
[25:38] the dress code down just right and if we
[25:40] ar if we aren't careful we miss
[25:44] Christ amen we'll get a box label of the
[25:46] message and it's stamped on us I was
[25:49] here so and so and there's no life on
[25:51] the inside of us I I say this to you if
[25:55] we go to school for 12 years in college
[25:58] and we get a doctorate degree and if we
[26:00] don't really pay attention we we'll make
[26:03] a very poor
[26:04] doctor you know if that gift isn't
[26:06] ignited we'll be just the mechanics of
[26:08] the doctor if we just go through the
[26:11] mechanics of of of learning how to do an
[26:13] airplane we we'll only we'll only just
[26:16] be able to teach somebody else if we're
[26:19] not careful we we we go through the
[26:21] mechanics of the message and it not live
[26:24] brother exactly it's one thing to be inv
[26:28] it's another to enjoy the feast that's
[26:31] right Hallelujah that's right there were
[26:34] many people that sat behind of brother
[26:36] Bram in the meetings and and come to our
[26:38] churches and sit there and they they
[26:41] live in a Justified state or in a
[26:43] Sanctified state but miss the presence
[26:46] of God living on the inside of
[26:50] them Jesus is sitting and just just
[26:54] sitting on
[26:56] waiting there they were in all of their
[26:59] their
[27:00] righteousness no doubt they were
[27:02] offering sacrifices and no doubt they
[27:04] were going and listening to the high
[27:07] priest as he he read the the
[27:10] script and they they felt within their
[27:13] hearts that they were all right
[27:16] yeah there was a woman oh my there was a
[27:20] woman just down the way come on that
[27:22] needed more than
[27:25] church that's right
[27:28] and this woman be to hear about
[27:30] everything that was going on yes and she
[27:34] came and she looked through the lattice
[27:36] work if we will and saw Jesus sitting
[27:40] there and a predestinated seed responded
[27:43] right there's something about a
[27:45] predestinated seed no matter how much
[27:47] the devil tries to muddle us up no
[27:50] matter how much he tries to destroy us
[27:54] no matter how much he tries to bombard
[27:55] our minds there's something about that
[27:58] seat on the inside of it once it's
[28:01] ignited and it comes into the right
[28:03] atmosphere you may have a lot of
[28:05] conditions in your life and complexes
[28:08] and everything else but God knows how to
[28:11] ignite that
[28:13] seed he knows how to ignite that seed
[28:16] when it comes in the right
[28:19] atmosphere and whether it was in haret
[28:21] form or whether it was a a drunk or a
[28:24] dope atdi it once that comes to life
[28:29] there's not a devil in
[28:31] hell that can destroy that life of God
[28:36] living inside
[28:37] of sometimes we ask
[28:40] ourselves why do I have such trouble
[28:43] right you know when I was in the world
[28:45] and I when I was drinking and I was I
[28:49] was smoking and I was I was doing all
[28:51] the things of habits of life that I was
[28:55] doing well I I didn't see
[28:57] have to fight in in a in a spiritual
[29:00] realm like I do
[29:03] now you know I you know I I don't
[29:06] understand you know I came to church and
[29:09] I I I sit on a Pew and I I give my heart
[29:12] to God but it seems like I'm in a
[29:16] war yeah amen it seems like I get out of
[29:20] bed on Monday morning we almost had
[29:22] Rapture Sunday but on Monday it seems
[29:25] like every Gate of Hell has just been
[29:28] turned loose on
[29:30] me and it and it and it just kind of I
[29:34] from my own observation it just feels
[29:36] like something's wrong
[29:40] somewhere well welcome to
[29:46] reality welcome to being a
[29:49] Christian it it's it's not Hollywood
[29:52] here and and you know it's not something
[29:55] that's put on but now you're in your
[29:58] molding
[30:00] State and if we could put it in almost a
[30:03] a story form if God could allow you to
[30:08] to to have been in the eternities with
[30:10] him and he could have told you you know
[30:13] now now here's the way it's going to
[30:15] work R I'm going to drop you down to the
[30:17] Earth and you're going to live so many
[30:19] years and and by the
[30:22] way I got a list of problems that you're
[30:24] going to go
[30:26] through
[30:28] now you're coming back to
[30:30] me but I got a list of problems you're
[30:33] going to go through in your
[30:36] life this is the way it's going to be I
[30:38] said hold it hold
[30:40] it right hold I'd rather not go through
[30:43] those
[30:44] problems oh brother Ron I want to go to
[30:46] heaven I I want to serve I I want to do
[30:49] I want to do whatever listen there's a
[30:50] molding process that you've got to go
[30:52] through oh brother Ron I believe when
[30:54] the Rapture takes place everything is
[30:56] going to be just just just every if
[30:58] everything's going to be fixed in my
[30:59] life somewhere between here and
[31:03] there amen somewhere between here and
[31:06] there there are some things that's going
[31:07] to be taken care of in your
[31:11] life
[31:13] exactly this fell that Jesus was talking
[31:18] about he came to this wedding
[31:21] Feast there some things that he had left
[31:24] out in his life yeah oh no doubt he was
[31:27] religious if we could put it that way no
[31:29] doubt he was religious I'm going I'm
[31:31] just going to speak to you like I'm
[31:32] speaking to a suay school class no doubt
[31:34] he was religious and no doubt
[31:37] he he served the Lord he he maybe had an
[31:41] easy believism yeah yeah you know no
[31:44] doubt he he believed if we could say it
[31:47] in our day and bring it to our day he
[31:49] believed brother Brown was a
[31:52] prophet he may have even lived in a
[31:54] Justified State of Mind you know and in
[31:57] his justification he could put his past
[31:59] life behind him maybe in sanctification
[32:02] he had he had cleansed his life up God
[32:05] had given him a new spirit and he
[32:07] cleansed his life and his habits up but
[32:10] he didn't have the wedding
[32:12] garment he didn't have the adoption
[32:15] Rob he wasn't he wasn't really didn't
[32:18] have the new birth he didn't have the
[32:21] life of God living on the inside
[32:25] of and you know you know without this
[32:28] you know you this is the
[32:30] token and you said well brother on all
[32:32] this message you know all of it all it
[32:34] just seems like it's so you know I can't
[32:37] understand this and I can't understand
[32:38] this and I can't understand this once he
[32:42] comes the scripture said he would lead
[32:45] and guide you in all truth he'll give
[32:48] you a highight that you'll be able to
[32:50] see him an ear that you'll be able to
[32:53] hear Glory it's just like coming to
[32:56] church and I know I'm just just kind of
[32:57] Bing here just for a few moments it's
[32:59] just like coming to church when you
[33:00] first get saved you come to church and
[33:03] you first get saved and you hear things
[33:06] you've never heard before in your life W
[33:09] there's stories that just fall off of
[33:10] the preacher's lips that that just why
[33:13] you've never heard anything like that
[33:14] ever before all you may have went to
[33:16] church after church after church but you
[33:18] know maybe there's been times that you
[33:20] walked away from church you said that's
[33:22] a biggest nut bunch of nuts I've ever
[33:23] seen in my life but seemed like next you
[33:27] found yourself starting right back there
[33:30] again right maybe you even shook the
[33:33] preacher's hand it was nice here but
[33:35] I'll probably never be back and there
[33:36] you are
[33:37] again and you see there was something on
[33:40] the inside of you about the size of a
[33:42] button that got
[33:44] ignited and God had been looking up for
[33:47] it are you with me now he knew where it
[33:48] was that but you know on the outward
[33:51] real you thought well I'll never go to
[33:53] church I've got a big fell that sits on
[33:55] the front row with me now it's actually
[33:58] second row he's 6'8 probably weighs
[34:01] about 270 sitting there he told me the
[34:04] other day he said I'll tell you brother
[34:05] Ron he said I hated preachers there's
[34:08] nothing about them that I
[34:10] like and I still can't figure out what
[34:13] I'm doing in
[34:15] church
[34:19] yeah right my family wasn't
[34:23] churchgoers oh but that seed of life
[34:27] amen exactly God knew exactly where you
[34:30] were at right amen
[34:34] amen that's right I'll never forget one
[34:37] time when I was there was a little lady
[34:40] came to the Altar and she said brother
[34:44] Ron my husband left me several years ago
[34:47] and and I I want him back I want him to
[34:51] come back to home
[34:53] and and I I want to be a real wife to
[34:57] him and and I want him to be a real
[35:00] Christian well I was thinking in my my
[35:02] own mind I was thinking well you
[35:04] probably better off than nut
[35:08] go but we
[35:12] prayed and the next Sunday morning as I
[35:16] preached there was a man sitting beside
[35:18] of her in
[35:21] church when I gave the offer call that
[35:24] man came to to the altar
[35:27] and when he came to the altar you know
[35:30] he just spent quite a long time at the
[35:31] altar and you know he just he just was a
[35:34] mess when he got up and he just W came
[35:36] up just picked me right
[35:42] up after after the service yeah this man
[35:47] this
[35:48] man be to talk to me he said you know it
[35:52] was
[35:53] Tuesday he said I I got back here
[35:55] Tuesday said oh oh he said but somewhere
[35:58] around 10:00 on
[36:00] Sunday just something spoke to my heart

[36:07] home and he said I thinking in my mind
[36:09] my wife will never have me back but but
[36:11] I need to go back and make some things
[36:12] right so it was on Tuesday I was sitting
[36:15] on her porch when she came home from
[36:17] work and she and I told her exactly like
[36:20] this I don't even know why I'm
[36:23] here you'll probably kill me but
[36:27] something happened
[36:31] Sunday make come
[36:37] back oh
[36:39] Hallelujah that's kind of like that
[36:41] Salon just floating around out there and
[36:43] he's been there for quite a spell but
[36:45] something tells him go
[36:46] on and he'll go across the Niagara Falls
[36:49] if he needs to go right and God come
[36:53] told John in the Book of Revelations
[36:56] come up here right amen come up here you
[37:01] say well brother r i don't understand it
[37:03] don't worry about it he'll get you

[37:08] yourself he'll take care of that when
[37:10] you get right to it I don't know how to
[37:13] make you through that trial he'll give
[37:15] you Grace in the very moment of your
[37:17] trial he'll give you strength exactly
[37:21] where you're at amen that's right can I
[37:24] deal with that invitation just a couple
[37:27] moments I I'll never forget I was
[37:30] preaching the meeting the pastor asked

[37:43] a big gymnasium here and going to be a
[37:45] lot of people coming and he says it's
[37:47] kind of a setup he said right at the end
[37:50] I want you to preach here's what I want
[37:52] you to do I want you to come in a
[37:53] T-shirt and a sweatshirt and blue jeans

[38:16] setting up you know chairs and so there
[38:17] was worldly people that said what are we
[38:19] doing
[38:21] here and they save dessert till the very
[38:24] last you got to keep people with food
[38:26] you
[38:27] know I don't know if we got food here
[38:29] tonight but you know something to
[38:31] do so anyway uh I I I was sitting there
[38:37] as I I begin to speak there was a man
[38:38] that was that was there and as I was
[38:42] speaking he began to get very
[38:45] upset and he I I noticed as he would
[38:48] tell his wife you know he he was so
[38:51] upset you know trying to get out and
[38:53] trying to leave and tore all the pieces
[38:56] and so cuz the meeting was going
[38:58] on then it came alter time
[39:02] and I just begin to talk you
[39:06] know and I noticed this man as he got
[39:10] up he walked right straight to me amen

[39:16] his Spikes all out of his black leather
[39:18] coat he ever hears his tape he'll know

[39:36] church
[39:42] somewhere he knows exactly where you're
[39:45] at right he knows exactly what your
[39:48] situation is that would be in your life
[39:51] right he knew exactly where that little
[39:54] woman was living at right that's right
[39:57] but he needed to be invited by
[39:59] Simon that he could have open invitation
[40:03] to deal with
[40:05] her and Simon may have thought that he
[40:08] was inviting him but he was only a tool
[40:12] in the path of a predestinated SE being
[40:16] born that's
[40:18] right right
[40:22] Hallelujah coming to
[40:24] life when Jesus begins to talk about
[40:27] this supper and he as he begins to lay
[40:29] it out and he begins to talk about this
[40:32] man had bought a piece of
[40:34] ground and this man had married a wife
[40:37] and this man had bought oxen and you can
[40:41] take every type that you could take but
[40:43] listen let me just bring it to us
[40:45] tonight in this layot of see and Age
[40:48] come on brother when Satan would like to
[40:50] bombard every one of our
[40:53] minds we're very aware here tonight that
[40:56] we are the final voice to the
[40:59] final we are very aware that we're the
[41:02] ones that have taken the book and we
[41:05] have eaten the book that's right we when
[41:08] when John was commissioned to eat the
[41:10] book and and and to take it all in not
[41:13] just parts of it but eat the whole
[41:15] book and and when this message came to
[41:18] us it was more right listen I I've been
[41:21] around it since I was a diapers but but
[41:24] this message is more than a man
[41:28] it's more than
[41:30] we it's more than just his personality
[41:33] but this is Christ his Bri
[41:39] for and it's more than just pastors it's
[41:43] more than just teachers it's more than
[41:45] just a fivefold Ministry but down to the
[41:48] littlest
[41:50] child sure sure you will see sure you
[41:53] will see the the humanness of us all
[41:57] amen if I get around you long enough I
[41:59] I'll find some qualities that you're
[42:02] struggling
[42:03] with if you get around me long enough
[42:06] you'll find that there's things about me
[42:08] that I'm struggling with but the god
[42:11] part of every one of us
[42:13] am
[42:15] amen that that that's that God part of
[42:18] us that God depositing on the inside of
[42:23] us knowing that we will live in the most
[42:26] deceitful age the age where that it
[42:29] would deceive the very elected if it
[42:31] were
[42:33] possible if it were possible would
[42:35] deceive where the boundary lines are so
[42:38] blurred right amen right they're so
[42:42] blurred everybody's born
[42:44] again so blur it's almost a political
[42:48] gospel
[42:49] anymore Clos line preaching is almost
[42:52] out are you with me now uh doctrinal
[42:55] lines have been drawn and this one
[42:57] fighting this one the devil done a real
[42:59] good job didn't he cuz listen if he
[43:02] can't whip you he joins
[43:04] you he can't push you down it pushes you
[43:06] up he can't make you feel like a
[43:08] hypocrite it makes you feel like the
[43:10] most righteous person in the
[43:12] building amen that's right exactly so
[43:16] what he'll do is he'll educate you in
[43:17] the message what he'll do is he'll make
[43:19] it easy for you what he'll do he'll say
[43:21] well you know you don't have to go to
[43:23] church you just yeah listen to a tape
[43:25] once in a
[43:26] yeah if you aren't careful there's no
[43:28] new
[43:31] birth right exactly that's the trth
[43:34] thank you we're not careful the things
[43:38] of the world right and he'll make us

[43:41] offer oh yeah you said well brother Ron
[43:43] we don't struggle with those things sure
[43:45] we do sure we do I don't care if you
[43:47] live in a tent you struggle with things
[43:49] that's
[43:51] right we all struggle right because it's
[43:55] it's our predes destinated hour to live
[43:57] in darkness and there's conditions in
[43:59] darkness that you and I have to live in
[44:02] because we're the Bride of this part of
[44:04] this age that's right are you with me
[44:07] brother Ron the Revival is it it it's
[44:10] just not happening well I don't know
[44:11] where you're living now but I'll tell
[44:13] you what if you get in his presence it's
[44:16] happening right now I don't like to bend
[44:20] here when brother brand was preaching
[44:21] all those me I'd love to be here but
[44:23] that wasn't when I was supposed to be
[44:25] born but this is the greatest hour that
[44:28] I
[44:28] know and every generation must have its
[44:31] own personal Revival exactly young
[44:34] people let me just say this to you
[44:35] tonight this message is just as much
[44:37] real to you as it is to me Glory that's
[44:41] right yes sir exct amen you know I I
[44:45] asked my boys I've got two boys and a
[44:47] girl my little girl's 20 years
[44:50] old it's hard to believe a it my baby
[44:54] doll is you know I used to carry her
[44:57] around I used to carry around in one of
[44:59] those little swing dresses and I twirl
[45:01] her and I dance with her and it would
[45:03] fly out now my baby dog yeah you know
[45:06] she's 20 years old driving my car yeah
[45:09] going to school wanting to be a teacher
[45:11] yeah why I told every boy in the country

[45:18] and finally there came along a guy that
[45:21] don't care about my
[45:24] guns he's got a long way to go
[45:30] yet but you
[45:32] know when brother Brown talks about a
[45:35] token it's more than just a good message
[45:38] that's right right it's more than a few
[45:40] quotes that says you know we've not come
[45:42] together to talk about the the message
[45:45] but to get into the message right and
[45:47] it's and it's more than just the
[45:49] chemistry of the blood cuz we can
[45:52] understand that that the blood of Christ
[45:55] washed every one of our sins away in the
[45:57] very life Calvary was the difference for
[46:00] us and it's more than the than the than
[46:02] a bottle of blood or blood that was shed
[46:05] on the ground but we realize what the
[46:07] atonement really was for us right and we
[46:11] realize that this message has the
[46:13] cleansing power that is within
[46:17] us sir where we don't have to live a
[46:20] halfway
[46:21] life where we don't have to give excuse
[46:24] so why we don't live

[47:39] Calvary making it simple he's
[47:42] resurrected he's been with them about 40
[47:45] days they've seen some phenomenal things
[47:47] right why some will have stories that he
[47:49] was with them that all day long Y and he
[47:53] took them all the way through the
[47:54] scriptures and we didn't know who he was
[47:57] until right he finally breaks some bread
[47:59] for our we identified who he

[49:09] excuses and in those
[49:13] excuses go ahead none of them were more

[49:53] of folks exactly or even a motivational
[49:57] speaker but that's a life a life
[50:01] experience put together in a
[50:04] thought and it takes much thought just
[50:07] to bring it to an hour however long you
[50:09] speak just to bring it to try to speak
[50:12] to your heart exactly and in that
[50:14] speaking to the heart many times we walk

[51:41] god notice what he says behold I stand
[51:44] at the Lord this was Christ coming to
[51:48] his wife amen bow the voice of a
[51:53] Kian amen amen
[51:55] exactly
[51:57] Hallelujah borrowing his voice speaking
[52:01] to his
[52:05] wife these are more than quotes which
[52:08] you're the physical living physical
[52:11] attributes of God that he thought of
[52:13] before the foundation of the
[52:16] world that's
[52:20] right
[52:24] bless
[52:26] Brother Sam and I spoke earlier
[52:29] today of course he didn't know where I
[52:31] was going this evening
[52:33] yeah sometimes we think well you know
[52:36] God don't love me or we get the we get
[52:38] the idea I'm all alone
[52:41] yeah but what God did for you before you
[52:44] ever got here is
[52:47] incredible that's
[52:53] right right
[52:55] well let's just take in very elementary
[52:57] form he took a picture of you before the
[52:59] foundational the world that's correct at
[53:01] your best right God thought of you mhm
[53:05] this isn't like a photo album that you
[53:06] flip through right but God thought of
[53:09] you and if you're ever in these Eternal
[53:11] thoughts right amen come on come on
[53:15] exactly if you're ever in his eternal
[53:17] thoughts he's not the kind of business
[53:19] man that just kind of goes through and
[53:20] thumbs I don't know if this is a good
[53:22] idea or
[53:23] not he's not the kind of project manager
[53:26] that starts it out and then decides it's
[53:28] not worth
[53:30] it he he's he's not the kind of that
[53:33] starts to build a house and then decided
[53:36] I can't count off the cost listen he
[53:38] sees through right that's right thank
[53:41] you Lord the
[53:43] project all brother you'll never know
[53:46] where that person was at or where they
[53:48] are you'll never know my my loved ones
[53:50] my children they're so far away from God
[53:54] uh-uh come on brother
[53:56] the guy standing before you tonight was
[53:58] homeless at one time right living in a
[54:01] drug house at one time right but I had a
[54:04] father and mother that didn't give up on
[54:12] me reminding God you made a covenant
[54:16] with us right
[54:18] exactly are you with me right you made a
[54:21] covenant with this God he is our husband
[54:24] right we take him at his word listen God
[54:26] is as good as his word right that's
[54:29] right made a covenant with God are you
[54:31] with me now God no matter where those
[54:34] thoughts are just now listen those
[54:37] attributes are now regardless of where
[54:40] they are now and many times there was no
[54:42] doubt there was much shame that I
[54:44] brought to my family brought to the
[54:46] church that I'd once been a part of but
[54:48] God who is rich in
[54:51] Mercy come on God who is rich in Mercy
[54:55] knows how to find you where you
[54:58] are
[55:01] amen that's true me thank you
[55:08] Lord so when we get the idea there's no
[55:11] way that's when God does business right
[55:15] that's right
[55:17] exactly I just keep feeling to go that
[55:19] way just for a few moments I'll never
[55:22] forget I was preaching in Billy Andrew's
[55:24] Church
[55:26] we quite a large meeting
[55:29] and the first night I had spoke on the
[55:33] on the autopsy of a dead
[55:40] Church
[55:43] yeah brother Cherry tizzle was my friend
[55:46] and he made the statement he said I
[55:47] believe everything that breede shouted
[55:48] here T
[55:53] night and so
[55:56] so the next night I was I was getting
[55:58] ready to I I went home that evening and
[56:02] from the meeting and on the way home I
[56:04] just felt impressed what you have for
[56:06] tomorrow night will not
[56:09] work and so I I just you know as a
[56:12] minister you just feel that empty Hollow
[56:14] spot yes sir and so I I just I begin to
[56:18] pray because I don't want to waste any
[56:21] time we don't have that kind of energy
[56:23] and so I just I begin to pray
[56:26] I I went to bed and I was just unsettled
[56:28] and somewhere around 4:00 I I woke up
[56:31] and the Lord took me to the woman at the
[56:34] well and as I as I just begin to think
[56:38] on these
[56:39] thoughts I thought now Lord what where
[56:42] do you want me to go with this and I
[56:44] just kept just feeling impressed you
[56:47] stay right here you stay right here so I
[56:50] went to the pulpit that evening and I
[56:52] was thinking Lord these people going to
[56:54] think I'm the one most simple preacher
[56:55] in the
[56:58] world so I be to deal with it I dealt
[57:01] with it about an hour and I just
[57:04] felt have prayer just
[57:07] now and as I bowed my head there was a
[57:10] girl that ran from the back back of that
[57:12] building and she came
[57:15] running and I'll never forget brother
[57:17] Billy he didn't know what was getting
[57:18] ready to go on and neither did I as a
[57:20] matter of fact I didn't even see her
[57:21] coming and brother Billy ran and grabbed
[57:26] her and he grabbed her she she she was
[57:30] getting ready to jump on the platform he
[57:32] grabbed her and she began I'm lost and I
[57:36] need God yeah and come to find out in a
[57:39] few moments she had just left her last
[57:42] customer as a
[57:44] harlot and a voice spoke to her go to
[57:47] this certain certain
[57:51] place God
[57:53] knows
[57:58] am as far as I know she's still a real
[58:01] sister amen thank you Lord God knows
[58:05] exactly where we
[58:07] are in our life glory and the thing
[58:11] about God is he's not embarrassed about
[58:13] our
[58:18] state that's right I know that might be
[58:20] a little difficult for us as human
[58:21] beings to look at one another well they
[58:23] got a ways to grow or they got a place
[58:25] to do or you know this one's not growing
[58:28] don't worry about that exactly God knows
[58:30] what he's got to do with us to get us
[58:32] where he needs to get
[58:34] us oh if we' got our mind too much on
[58:37] this or too much on that he knows how to
[58:39] take care of that amen that's right amen
[58:43] you know sometimes we as ministers feel
[58:45] that if we're not careful we're like
[58:47] parents we get embarrassed by our
[58:49] children yeah and we're constantly
[58:51] always having to defend our children my
[58:53] children never do that don't kid
[58:57] yourself or maybe we're trying to make
[58:59] an easier way for our children all you
[59:01] got to do is believe no you got to have
[59:03] a
[59:05] birth oh you got to just come to church

[1:02:09] our Awakening right Jesus amen
[1:02:13] hallelujah that's
[1:02:17] rightl brother Ron I I I don't
[1:02:20] understand the I don't I'm just taking
[1:02:22] some Elementary things here go ahead I
[1:02:24] don't understand it I don't understand
[1:02:26] how you guys get so excited about such
[1:02:29] simple
[1:02:31] thoughts yeah well I don't understand
[1:02:34] how how a prophet with such a a small
[1:02:38] education would talk about bovin and
[1:02:40] Shakespeare right
[1:02:46] right that's right I just don't
[1:02:48] understand at all right you know I
[1:02:51] thought I was escaping
[1:02:52] Shakespeare when I left
[1:02:55] school but here I come to Shalom and
[1:02:58] brother Brown reminds us of Shakespeare
[1:03:00] in bethoven
[1:03:07] my daughter-in-law has a double master
[1:03:09] since you wouldn't even know what to
[1:03:11] talk to her but in in
[1:03:15] school in Theology and composition oh
[1:03:19] my not in theology but in in in
[1:03:22] composition and she shoot right
[1:03:26] there but she Theory and composition
[1:03:29] Theory there you
[1:03:31] go and so I was quoting this about
[1:03:37] Beethoven and so she was going through a
[1:03:39] pretty comprehensive study
[1:03:41] and and they said want you tell me a
[1:03:44] little bit about him of course we knew
[1:03:47] some things yeah bethoven was quite an
[1:03:52] incredible composer
[1:03:56] but really his gift wasn't honed until
[1:04:00] he lost his hearing right and in losing
[1:04:03] his hearing you see under the pressure
[1:04:07] of losing his hearing he had to cut the
[1:04:09] legs off at his piano and he would put
[1:04:13] his ear and on the floor and he would
[1:04:17] write out his music yeah y his weakness
[1:04:21] drove him to a masterpiece right
[1:04:24] Glory
[1:04:27] am right amen and though he couldn't
[1:04:32] hear his music even
[1:04:35] played it drove him into isolation y
[1:04:38] whether he was a very irritable human
[1:04:41] being y he couldn't be around people hey
[1:04:45] as a matter of fact going up and down
[1:04:46] the street it was difficult for him to
[1:04:48] communicate with anybody so he kind of
[1:04:51] been become such an edgy person that
[1:04:53] there was but yet seemed like everything
[1:04:56] that he touched was masterpieces
[1:05:00] right and so I was dealing with her
[1:05:04] about you know what brother brandom says
[1:05:07] you know the Note S and you know the
[1:05:10] director gets under the spirit of the
[1:05:13] composer and yet and then you know when
[1:05:15] that syphony is played together every
[1:05:17] character comes into its right
[1:05:20] place and it's every one of them's
[1:05:24] personal
[1:05:25] responsibility that's right and so this
[1:05:28] one will begin to come and this one will
[1:05:30] begin to come and maybe it's a national
[1:05:32] Symphony I've got a I've got a cousin
[1:05:34] that plays in it and and there's people
[1:05:36] that come from all over the United
[1:05:38] States and even the world bringing their
[1:05:40] instruments to play in this certain
[1:05:42] Orchestra and they are at the they're at
[1:05:44] their top of their level of their life
[1:05:47] and they come in and and they they come
[1:05:49] and they play together and they they
[1:05:52] practice together and when they begin
[1:05:54] and they're sitting there I've actually
[1:05:56] been there and when they're sitting
[1:05:57] there it sounds like a huge bunch of
[1:06:00] just
[1:06:03] noise and to a red Knight like myself
[1:06:06] it's just
[1:06:08] nonsense
[1:06:10] right and I'm wondering why it's even
[1:06:12] worth the price of admission but this
[1:06:15] guy grabs a stick come on and maybe he's
[1:06:18] ballhead or he's got a shock of hair and
[1:06:20] he's standing there and he begins to
[1:06:23] shake that stick and a certain
[1:06:27] direction and it's a chosen piece maybe
[1:06:30] from Beethoven or from BL right but it's
[1:06:33] more than a piece of music to him
[1:06:35] brother exactly it's more than just a
[1:06:38] bunch of lyrics that are putting
[1:06:40] together but this one is gathered from
[1:06:42] here and this one's gathered from here
[1:06:44] and they brought their instrument and
[1:06:47] they are at their
[1:06:50] best oh they may be a flute player but
[1:06:53] they're one of the best in the whole
[1:06:56] world they're one of the best in the
[1:06:58] whole world that listen they stand up
[1:07:01] they stand out no matter where they're
[1:07:03] at or who they're playing with but today
[1:07:06] there was 600 other people and they're
[1:07:09] sitting there and they're going to have
[1:07:10] a part right right amen come on they're
[1:07:14] going to have a part or maybe the
[1:07:17] triangle player he's going to have a
[1:07:18] part the symbol players got a part the
[1:07:21] trion's got a part and every one of them
[1:07:24] come to their part right right right
[1:07:27] come on now
[1:07:28] alone don't sound like a whole lot right
[1:07:31] right yeah but put it together right
[1:07:34] right
[1:07:36] exactly put it together right right now
[1:07:40] I I will say this to you there are times
[1:07:43] we as
[1:07:45] ministers come on bless we know some of
[1:07:49] your struggles yeah right if we've got
[1:07:53] how we pull them
[1:07:57] M but when you're under the inspiration
[1:08:00] of the word and it's more than a
[1:08:03] quote and knowing you've been gathered
[1:08:05] from all ends of Earth come on brother
[1:08:08] and you come and you're the very best
[1:08:10] that God could have thought
[1:08:13] of listen because if God could have got
