[26:42] be ready to go
[26:44] amen well god bless you this evening
[26:46] we're going to look right into the
[26:47] scripture and
[26:49] we'll look into first
[26:50] samuel
[26:51] first chapter
[26:53] and
[26:54] begin first
[26:55] uh first vote for
[26:58] verse four
[26:59] and uh see when they bring it up
[27:02] tonight i
[27:03] got a little
[27:04] interesting thought
[27:07] i don't know if
[27:10] kind of odd
[27:12] i won't speak about bitterness tonight
[27:18] [Laughter]
[27:22] but
[27:26] you know
[27:29] anybody anybody any of the ministers
[27:32] knows one thing you can have about
[27:34] a half dozen ideas thoughts and and
[27:37] they're in different stages of of
[27:39] completion
[27:42] and so the lord gave you a thought and
[27:43] you work on it for a little bit and he
[27:44] said on the shelf and you work on it and
[27:46] you get a thought and sometimes it's
[27:48] just a scripture and then the lord gave
[27:49] you a quote or something you put it
[27:51] aside and
[27:53] and so i i was sitting there well you
[27:54] know i just kept thinking i was trying
[27:56] to find
[27:57] the mind of the lord
[27:59] and for some reason it just kept coming
[28:01] back to this
[28:02] and i'm thinking
[28:04] i don't understand
[28:05] why
[28:09] but
[28:10] you know
[28:12] it's it's not our job to figure things
[28:13] out our job is just to listen just
[28:16] follow the leadership of the lord so
[28:18] um
[28:20] i think the lord gave us something
[28:21] tonight so
[28:22] uh we're just gonna speak to the author
[28:24] tonight we're gonna just read the
[28:26] scripture i don't i don't think i'll be
[28:27] here very long tonight but that's all
[28:29] right
[28:30] you know lord just speak what he has for
[28:33] us and we don't have to be here
[28:34] you know but we do want to give him his
[28:36] opportunity his time
[28:39] so you know
[28:41] we don't we don't have to have saint
[28:43] paul although brother brown said you
[28:44] know good for our sermon's good but
[28:46] um
[28:47] you know we know it's okay to preach 45
[28:49] minutes too
[28:51] and uh
[28:52] but just the lord have his way with us
[28:54] tonight so i don't get everybody get
[28:56] nervous you know
[28:59] [Laughter]
[29:02] amen let's all bow our heads i know all
[29:05] everybody has
[29:07] i think about all the people on the
[29:09] prayer list downstairs and the different
[29:11] ones and
[29:13] and i continue to pray for brother
[29:14] howell and the different ones and
[29:18] i just believe god's going to work a
[29:19] miracle
[29:20] whether whether we see it or not and
[29:22] that's what god said we're just going to
[29:24] put our trust in him and claim the word
[29:28] because you know what
[29:30] he said if we would believe he would do
[29:32] it
[29:33] amen let's just hold our heads our
[29:35] heavenly father
[29:37] father we just so thankful lord to be in

[32:10] amen
[32:11] first samuel
[32:12] chapter 1 verse 4 says
[32:16] and i cut some of this out because
[32:19] most of you know the story this is this
[32:21] is about hannah
[32:24] and elkanah was her husband and paneer
[32:28] panina
[32:29] was his other wife
[32:31] so uh
[32:33] just just to save time
[32:35] i cut some of that up because i think
[32:36] most everybody kind of knows the story
[32:38] so
[32:39] it says when when the time and when the
[32:42] time was that elkanah offered
[32:45] so he would go to shiloh
[32:47] and make his offerings he gave
[32:50] nina his wife and to all her sons and
[32:53] her daughters portions but unto hannah
[32:55] he gave a worthy portion for he loved
[32:58] hannah but the lord had shut up her womb
[33:01] and her adversary also provoked her sore
[33:04] for to make her fret because the lord
[33:06] had shut up her womb and as he did so
[33:09] year by year when she went up to the
[33:12] house of the lord so she provoked her
[33:15] therefore she wept and did not eat
[33:18] then said elkanah her husband to her
[33:20] hannah why weepest thou and why eat us
[33:23] thou not and why is thy heart grieved
[33:26] am not i better to thee
[33:29] then ten sons
[33:31] so hannah rose up after they eaten in
[33:34] shiloh and after they had drunk
[33:36] now eli the priest
[33:38] sat
[33:39] upon a seat by a post of the temple of
[33:42] the lord
[33:45] and she was in bitterness of soul and
[33:48] prayed unto the lord
[33:50] and wept sore and she vowed a vow and
[33:53] said o lord of hosts if thou will indeed
[33:55] look upon the affliction of thine
[33:57] handmaid and remember me and and not
[33:59] forget thine handmaid but will give unto
[34:02] thy handmaid a man child then i will
[34:04] give him unto the lord all the days of
[34:06] his life and there shall no razor come
[34:09] upon his head amen god bless you you can
[34:12] be seated
[34:23] i don't want to
[34:24] speak on bitterness and
[34:28] the definition of bitterness
[34:31] of course we know it's a state or a
[34:32] condition of being bitter
[34:36] and
[34:37] it says of people or their feelings or
[34:39] behaviors angry hurt or resentful
[34:41] because of one's bad experiences or a
[34:44] sense of unjust treatment
[34:46] often used for emphasis painful or
[34:48] unpleasant to accept or contemplate
[34:51] because lots of times people get bitter
[34:53] and it's not that
[34:56] it's not that they feel like they've
[34:58] been
[34:59] treated bad they just can't
[35:01] process
[35:03] the situation that they're in
[35:05] and so that
[35:07] creates bitterness in people
[35:10] and
[35:11] we see here that hannah
[35:13] you know
[35:15] under knowing the story you know here's
[35:17] here's hannah
[35:19] and you know here's here's a woman that
[35:21] has a great desire
[35:23] to be a mother
[35:25] you know she wanted a child and and you
[35:27] know it's one thing to to have a desire
[35:30] for something
[35:31] and to know that's what god created you
[35:33] for
[35:34] i mean she was she was a woman she was
[35:35] desire she was designed and created to
[35:38] be a mother that was that was one of her
[35:40] callings in life
[35:42] and here she is she has this great
[35:43] desire but the scripture tells us you
[35:45] know that god closed up her wound
[35:49] well you know
[35:50] it's like if you had a great desire to
[35:51] do something and god stops you
[35:53] and then you know then then on top of
[35:56] that you know here is here is uh pene
[36:01] you know
[36:02] her adversary
[36:05] that's what struck me here's your
[36:06] adversary
[36:08] and she comes
[36:10] and every time she gets an opportunity
[36:12] she's poking you
[36:16] she is stirring this thing up
[36:18] she knows what your problem is
[36:22] and i every time
[36:24] she comes and then she's just trying to
[36:26] stir it up
[36:29] now you can imagine that every time they
[36:31] get together you know no you know i'm
[36:34] sure that she never uh passed up an
[36:37] opportunity to give hannah grief about
[36:40] this
[36:41] every time the children were by she if
[36:44] if hannah was in earshot she made sure
[36:46] that hannah got to hear all about it
[36:49] and every time she could do whatever she
[36:51] could to make hannah feel bad is that
[36:54] exactly what she was doing
[36:57] she was just stirring as we say the pot
[36:59] she's all the time causing havoc causing
[37:02] her grief and here she is you know and
[37:04] she's all the time praying to god for uh
[37:08] a child
[37:09] you know she has this desire and but god
[37:12] closed up her womb
[37:15] and many times you know we don't
[37:16] understand why god allows things happen
[37:19] in our lives but you know we have a
[37:20] great desire to do something for god and
[37:23] we we want to do something for god and
[37:25] yet god stops us from doing it
[37:28] god doesn't god doesn't make a way and
[37:30] it's like well why why would i have this
[37:32] desire to do this if i can't do it
[37:36] and so you know it does create a
[37:39] you know
[37:40] a bitterness it creates a
[37:43] uh you know i
[37:45] hate to say the word but i mean it's
[37:47] like it's almost a hatred
[37:49] you become because you become you get to
[37:51] the point sometimes when you can't do
[37:53] something and it doesn't work out you
[37:54] become to resent this desire that you
[37:57] have
[37:59] so here you are you're struggling with
[38:00] this because you're trying to because
[38:02] you know why why would god give you this
[38:04] desire but then he stands in your way
[38:08] and here you are i want to do this
[38:11] well see the thing is many times we get
[38:13] to the point sometimes where as as i was
[38:16] saying about where brother dale's always
[38:18] talked about people when they when they
[38:19] get sick
[38:21] and you see people that get sick and the
[38:23] first thing they want to do is like well
[38:25] no matter how bad the doctor's report is
[38:27] they want to say well i'm healed
[38:30] yeah and they want to walk in that for a
[38:33] while until the next report is worse
[38:35] than the first then
[38:37] they don't they they become to begin to
[38:39] waver in their faith
[38:43] because they begin to waver in that
[38:45] faith then then when the next one comes
[38:47] and it's even worse then it's like well
[38:49] you know i may pass away for the glory
[38:51] of god
[38:52] well maybe maybe this is not this is not
[38:54] for me
[38:57] well maybe maybe god's trying your faith
[39:02] so maybe maybe when everything gets
[39:04] worse then maybe god wants you to look
[39:06] to see are you going to stand and claim
[39:09] his his word are you going to just start
[39:11] to waver in what you believe
[39:14] because you know if you don't have a a a
[39:18] revelation of something because you know
[39:20] what we all have to we all have to take
[39:22] it by faith by mental faith a middle
[39:24] conception
[39:25] that's where it starts you've got you've
[39:28] got to read the word and you've got to
[39:30] take it into your mind and you've got to
[39:31] make a mental thought
[39:34] not a revelation from god but it's got
[39:35] to be a mental thought in your mind that
[39:37] you're going to believe that
[39:40] because brother name said most of our
[39:42] faith is mental faith
[39:44] but he said you've got to bring the word
[39:46] to your mental faith he said until it
[39:48] becomes a spiritual revelation
[39:50] so then you've got to hold on to what
[39:52] god said so you've got to hold on to
[39:55] that and say well no matter what
[39:57] whichever way the winds blow whichever
[39:59] way whatever happens then you can say
[40:01] well you know what i didn't believe the
[40:02] first report
[40:04] and so when it when it gets worse i'm
[40:05] not going to believe the second report
[40:08] and if it gets worse i'm not going why
[40:10] because i didn't believe the first two
[40:14] why because if he said if he is if he is
[40:15] my healer and he healed me from all my
[40:18] diseases whatever comes then you know
[40:19] what if if he raised him if he raised
[40:21] lazarus who was four days in the in the
[40:23] grave and he was rotten and his nose
[40:26] fell in if god can raise him up then you
[40:28] know what if i've got something and i'm
[40:30] still breathing air then you know what
[40:32] god is more than able to raise me up
[40:34] but the problem is is are you going to
[40:36] claim it
[40:39] i tell everybody i still love that
[40:40] because you know i was i still talk
[40:42] about brother dick and
[40:44] you know i was i was praying for brother
[40:45] dick when he had cancer and you know and
[40:47] you know the lord when the lord dropped
[40:48] in the truck that day and he told me he
[40:50] said you know he said lazarus was four
[40:52] days in the grave
[40:54] and then you know he just struck me it's
[40:55] like well praise god you know and they
[40:56] just gave me a whole new outflow because
[40:58] you get so burdened with things and it's
[41:00] like you know what i had a brand new
[41:01] outlook on it
[41:02] hey god god god's more than able you
[41:04] know what i just give it to god i'm not
[41:06] going to worry about it
[41:08] because god's a healer
[41:10] and he's the one that's going he's a
[41:11] problem solver he's a burden bearer so
[41:14] he's going to take care of it i'm not
[41:15] going to worry about it
[41:16] because you know what i prayed about it
[41:18] and i've put it in his hands and he
[41:20] securely got it
[41:21] but see here's hannah every time she's
[41:24] praying and she's desiring this this
[41:27] child and all of a sudden every single
[41:29] time that she comes then every day every
[41:32] year the same thing happens she's
[41:34] carrying this burden of trying to have a
[41:37] child and she's got somebody there
[41:39] that's standing there harassing her and
[41:42] always there in front of her trying to
[41:44] stop her
[41:47] and here you know she got to the point
[41:48] where she couldn't eat she was so she
[41:50] was so upset about everything well you
[41:51] know it was no no wonder you know this
[41:54] panel she was just you know she was just
[41:56] eating this up she was just living
[41:58] and you know there you know there's
[41:59] people you know what we don't we don't
[42:00] want to believe it but you know god puts
[42:02] people in your lives and that's all
[42:04] they're there for
[42:09] the script the song says uh
[42:12] folks may oppose me friends may beset me
[42:14] but still i'll enter in
[42:17] you know what you got friends that that
[42:18] you know they
[42:19] they're your friends but you know
[42:21] sometimes they're like like job said
[42:23] they're physicians of no value
[42:26] they're they're there but you know what
[42:28] they're there just to cause you problems
[42:31] and you know sometimes sometimes the
[42:33] problem is is when we see things come
[42:34] our way you know what we don't look and
[42:36] say you know this is good this is for my
[42:38] good right
[42:41] every single day we get up and say you
[42:42] know praise god this is for my good
[42:46] well you know after a while
[42:47] as hannah having this desire you know
[42:50] you know after a while it probably she
[42:52] couldn't get up and say this is for my
[42:54] good
[42:56] so many because sometimes sometimes you
[42:58] wake up and you know it's just like it's
[43:00] all you gonna do to get out of bed
[43:03] and somebody ask you how you doing i'm
[43:05] doing great
[43:06] and then you want to go find a closet or
[43:08] someplace to hide so you can cry
[43:13] because you know you when you sit down
[43:15] and you actually get before god you
[43:17] realize hey i'm not well i'm not right
[43:20] i'm i'm so burdened and i'm so
[43:23] distraught with this i don't know what
[43:24] to do
[43:28] you know everybody
[43:29] you know sometimes you talk to people
[43:31] and you know everything's so great and
[43:33] you know they never have
[43:35] they never have problems or anything
[43:37] like that or you know we think they
[43:38] don't and you know i always like to say
[43:40] you know if everything's going good for
[43:42] you you pray for me because you know i
[43:45] was thinking about like what brother uh
[43:47] brother diggs was saying you know he
[43:49] identified himself as job all the
[43:51] problems that he's went to and you get
[43:52] through one you got another problem you
[43:54] get through that one you got another
[43:55] problem
[43:57] so everybody said well you know brother
[43:59] brown never told us that we had to we
[44:00] was going to have a a mountain top
[44:02] everybody wants a mountaintop experience
[44:06] mountain transfiguration mount carmel i
[44:08] don't think but he said he said but in
[44:10] the valley is where you grow
[44:13] that's where you really grow he said
[44:15] that's where you find the lily of the
[44:16] valley is in the valleys you've got to
[44:18] go through those hard times you've got
[44:20] to go through the tolls
[44:23] but god has a place for us
[44:27] here
[44:28] picking up in in first samuel the
[44:30] reading the the rest of the
[44:32] the chapter here are part of it
[44:35] first samuel
[44:37] beginning at verse 12 and it says and it
[44:40] came to pass as she continued praying
[44:42] before the lord that eli marked her
[44:44] mouth
[44:46] now hannah she spake in her heart only
[44:48] her lips moved but her voice was not
[44:50] heard therefore eli thought she had been
[44:53] drunken
[44:54] and eli said unto her how long will thou
[44:56] be drunken put away thy wine from thee
[44:59] but hannah answered and said no my lord
[45:02] i am a woman of sorrowful spirit
[45:05] i have drunk neither wine or strong
[45:06] drink but i have poured out my soul
[45:08] before the lord
[45:10] caught now cut
[45:12] count not thy handmaid for a daughter of
[45:14] bellio
[45:16] for out of the abundance of my complaint
[45:19] and grief have i spoken hitherto
[45:22] then eli answered and said go in peace
[45:25] and the god of israel grant thee thy pos
[45:28] petition
[45:29] that thou has asked of him and she said
[45:33] let that handmaid find grace in thy
[45:34] sight so the woman went her way and did
[45:37] eat and her countenance was no more sad
[45:41] and they uh rose up in the morning early
[45:44] and worshiped before the lord and
[45:45] returned and came to their house in
[45:47] ramah
[45:48] and elk and i knew hannah his wife
[45:51] and the lord remembered her therefore it
[45:52] came to pass when the time was come
[45:56] about after hannah had conceived that
[45:58] she bear a son and called his name
[46:00] samuel saying because i asked him
[46:03] of the lord amen
[46:07] you know i
[46:08] i want to
[46:09] look at
[46:12] it's so interesting because you know
[46:13] what
[46:15] you know
[46:17] i was thinking about what brother wade
[46:18] was talking about the other day he's
[46:19] like every time people have problems the
[46:21] first thing they do is they leave
[46:24] you can't find them
[46:26] they leave church you know but you know
[46:28] what was so funny what was so
[46:30] interesting and i thought was so good
[46:31] was hannah
[46:33] and and all of her struggles and all of
[46:35] her problems and and all of this that
[46:37] she was going through the first thing
[46:38] that she does when
[46:40] she leaves everybody else and everybody
[46:42] else has had a good time they've ate and
[46:43] they've drunk and they they're they're
[46:45] having resting and all these other
[46:46] things but you know what she does she
[46:48] goes to the temple
[46:50] she takes off ahead of everybody else
[46:53] goes by herself
[46:55] because she's going to pour out her
[46:57] petition before god
[47:00] and you know she goes there because she
[47:02] i believe she went there for the for the
[47:04] express purpose of getting an answer
[47:06] from god
[47:07] i believe that she she was there that
[47:09] she was expecting god to meet her need
[47:11] that he she came and she began to pour
[47:14] it out
[47:16] and you know when you when you get in
[47:17] the presence of god as you know when and
[47:20] you begin to pour out your your petition
[47:22] before god when you get into a place
[47:24] where you know you're not worried about
[47:25] what everybody else is doing you're not
[47:26] looking around to see what else is going
[47:28] on but it's just you and god
[47:30] you know as that song you know shut in
[47:33] with god in a secret place
[47:35] there in the spirit beholding his face
[47:38] you know when you get in a place where
[47:39] it's just you and god then you know then
[47:42] she got into a place well eli thought
[47:43] she was drunk
[47:46] but you know what she was in a place
[47:48] where she was just her and god god she
[47:50] was pouring out and she said i've poured
[47:52] out my soul because i'm so burdened and
[47:54] i'm pouring out my complaint before god
[47:57] why because i i've carried this all i
[47:59] can do you know i'm just so completely
[48:00] wore out from this i'm just so empty
[48:02] that i'm coming before god and i'm just
[48:04] going to pour myself out
[48:07] but you know what was so amazing when
[48:09] she began to tell the the priest when
[48:11] she began to tell the minister of her
[48:13] problem she come in and poured it out
[48:15] and then she began to tell the minister
[48:17] then you know what then the minister
[48:19] began eli began to minister to her
[48:22] when you come to the house of god and
[48:24] you pour out your petition that's the
[48:26] reason brother branham said when we come
[48:27] here he said if you have a need on your
[48:29] heart he said he's obligated he's
[48:31] obligated to put somebody behind the
[48:33] pulpit to answer your question
[48:38] it's not it's not worth it it's in my
[48:40] notes but you know what it's it's if
[48:42] it's in his mind he can put it in my
[48:44] mind so i can speak it
[48:47] and it's every time anybody comes
[48:49] whether it's brother bob brother luis or
[48:51] whatever if you come here then god's
[48:53] obligated
[48:55] sometimes we fail to realize you know it
[48:57] doesn't matter we could be riding in the
[48:58] car god if we pray if we pour out our
[49:01] petitions before god
[49:03] and lay it before god then you know he's
[49:05] obligated to meet our needs he's
[49:07] obligated to come and speak
[49:11] but you know there's a there's a way
[49:12] that you do that that god can come and
[49:14] speak i was thinking of brother branham
[49:17] there when when he was talking about the
[49:19] the young girl that that he he said that
[49:21] was going to be healed and and she
[49:23] passed away and you know he come to god
[49:25] and he said he said you owe me an answer
[49:29] one because he said that she was going
[49:31] to be healed and she died
[49:34] and he's like and you know god just let
[49:36] him sulk
[49:38] just turn him out just let it just let
[49:40] him go
[49:43] and let him go through that for a while
[49:44] just
[49:45] riding on that
[49:48] he said he never did you know and he
[49:49] just stuck with him why did you why did
[49:51] why did you say this and why why did she
[49:54] i saw all this and she was gonna be
[49:55] healed and everything and then all of a
[49:57] sudden she died
[50:01] well you know when when he got over that
[50:04] and the lord let him sit on that for a
[50:05] while and
[50:06] mull it over and
[50:08] get over his
[50:10] chip on his shoulder or whatever
[50:12] then the lord come and told him said
[50:14] listen
[50:15] that girl should have died a year ago
[50:18] but he said i gave her grace for her to
[50:21] get ready
[50:23] for her to be saved and now it's her
[50:26] time to go
[50:29] see we don't god doesn't owe us an
[50:31] explanation
[50:35] you know god god doesn't have to tell
[50:37] you know it it'd be wonderful if god
[50:38] told us everything
[50:41] you know if if god you know if we know
[50:44] what was going to happen tomorrow and
[50:45] what was going to happen the next day
[50:46] and you know every time everything you
[50:47] know we just had to answer had to answer
[50:50] you know man it'd be great but you know
[50:52] what there's no overcoming in that
[50:55] there is no overcoming in that
[50:58] right
[50:58] then you you know because you got to
[51:00] walk by faith
[51:02] so you got to put your trust in him and
[51:04] walk by what he says
[51:06] if you already if you already knew what
[51:07] was going to happen then you know what
[51:09] then there's no overcoming
[51:12] then you're just being pushed along
[51:16] but you know when you've got to pour out
[51:17] your your heart and your and your soul
[51:20] to god and you've got to put your trust
[51:22] in him and say well lord i don't know
[51:23] what to do but you know what i'm just
[51:25] going to trust you and i'm going and
[51:26] yeah i'm just i just see this this seems
[51:28] like the best way to go
[51:31] i think about brother branham all those
[51:33] times where he was out there and he said
[51:34] you know i've got a stack of i got the
[51:35] stack of invitations to go here and
[51:37] there and preach and and all these
[51:39] different things and he said i don't
[51:40] know he said i'm just going he said
[51:41] because they've asked me and i'm going
[51:44] he said i got no certain leaning of the
[51:45] spirit to do any of these things but he
[51:47] said we're just going
[51:50] but he said you know sometimes the lord
[51:51] did speak to him and say hey you need to
[51:53] go here you need to go there do this
[51:56] so lots of times you know we don't we
[51:57] don't have a you know god don't write it
[51:59] in the sky for us and tell us hey we're
[52:01] going to do this or you know you got to
[52:03] do this sometimes you just got to go
[52:06] you got to live your life and you got to
[52:08] walk by faith
[52:12] and so you know it's not where you know
[52:14] we could just
[52:15] sit on the couch or sit in a chair stare
[52:18] at the walls and you know not do
[52:19] anything
[52:21] but you know that's not what god wants
[52:23] us to do
[52:26] and sometimes you know we've got to take
[52:27] things because god wants us to kind of
[52:30] work these things out and all of a
[52:31] sudden you start doing things and all of
[52:32] a sudden that god starts
[52:34] he starts pointing you in different
[52:36] directions about things
[52:38] [Music]
[52:42] so we have to follow the leading of the
[52:44] lord
[52:52] now
[52:53] you know when you when you think of
[52:56] this where you have to
[52:58] you walk in
[53:00] bitterness and
[53:02] you know the the other the other person
[53:03] in the scripture i think of when when
[53:06] you think of having having somebody
[53:08] that's that was bitter about things and
[53:11] and walking
[53:13] and having a having a journey was naomi
[53:19] you know i was thinking about how how
[53:21] naomi
[53:23] and and her husband
[53:25] you know she had two sons
[53:28] and two daughter-in-laws well she had
[53:29] two sons they went down you know they
[53:31] hey there's a famine in the land
[53:34] hey this is so you know what we're gonna
[53:35] leave the land of promise
[53:38] because you know what we got we got to
[53:40] go get eat
[53:41] now we're not going to stay in the land
[53:42] of promise because that's where god told
[53:43] us to stay
[53:45] because we got to go feed our bellies
[53:47] we're not going to follow the word
[53:49] but we're going to walk in we're going
[53:50] we're going to follow what we think
[53:55] now now if we if we follow what god said
[53:57] then they should have stayed in the land
[53:58] of promise even though there was a
[53:59] famine
[54:01] amen but you know what god brought them
[54:03] through because he did
[54:06] now there's one thing that we can do
[54:08] when we don't have any uh specific word
[54:13] then you know we we just kind of walk by
[54:15] faith
[54:17] but you know it's interesting how people
[54:19] they they say i got i got a word from
[54:20] the lord and i'm gonna do this and i'm
[54:22] gonna go here now and you know you know
[54:23] when you get there it's like well you
[54:25] know that's against the word
[54:27] you know it's in black and white and red
[54:32] just like people say well you know what
[54:33] i'm gonna work a job and i'm gonna work
[54:35] on sunday and i'm gonna give the money
[54:37] to the
[54:38] the missions
[54:40] or or or whatever
[54:44] or whatever you know whatever they they
[54:46] want to do or i'm gonna i'm gonna leave
[54:47] this church and i'm gonna go here and
[54:48] i'm gonna go there and i'm gonna do
[54:50] these things and you know it's like well
[54:52] put it in the word
[54:55] the problem is they can't put it in the
[54:57] word
[54:59] and then all of a sudden you know as as
[55:01] you know
[55:02] you can talk to people
[55:05] i i had a minister one time and and this
[55:08] this lady had had went around and she
[55:10] had and she wanted to get remarried
[55:13] and she went around talking all these
[55:14] all these ministers and everybody kept
[55:15] telling her it's you can't you can't you
[55:17] can't yeah whatever
[55:20] she went to this other preacher and he
[55:21] said go ahead
[55:24] and they just about lost their minds
[55:25] when he said that he's like hey she's
[55:26] going to do it anyway
[55:29] it's like now she'll leave everybody
[55:31] else alone because you know what she's
[55:32] going to do it anyway
[55:35] i mean just go ahead
[55:38] i mean if you're going if you go if you
[55:39] want to go in the world go in the world
[55:41] you know i mean
[55:44] you if you want to do something go ahead
[55:46] just like like brother dale said you
[55:47] know what you you come in there and you
[55:49] people come to office and and or by the
[55:51] way talk about people want to come into
[55:52] office and they want they want to if
[55:54] they don't want your opinion they're
[55:56] just going to come in there and tell you
[55:56] what they're going to do then okay do it
[56:01] but they don't come in there to ask you
[56:02] what what what your thought is
[56:05] they're just going to tell you this
[56:06] that's what i'm going to do well then
[56:08] then go
[56:10] you're not asking for the leadership of
[56:11] the lord
[56:13] you've got a desire whatever's burning
[56:15] in your heart to do go
[56:17] you know you're not going to help
[56:19] anybody
[56:21] but you know i mean if you try to tell
[56:23] somebody it's like you're just like
[56:25] balaam balaam kept coming to god wanting
[56:27] to curse the children of israel you know
[56:28] what he finally told him go ahead
[56:32] now he he told him he said it was a
[56:34] contrary to the word for him to do that
[56:36] but you know what that was in balaam's
[56:38] that was balaam's desire to do that and
[56:40] brother brown said he sent balaam out
[56:41] there to do that
[56:44] and so you know if it's your desire
[56:46] because you know what if you've got a
[56:47] desire to serve the lord you're going to
[56:49] serve the lord and if you don't have the
[56:50] desire to serve the lord you're not
[56:51] going to serve the lord
[56:54] if you because you know it's what's on
[56:57] the inside that's what's going to
[56:58] motivate you
[57:01] so as
[57:02] we see we see
[57:04] naomi as they went into the end of the
[57:06] end of the land of moab
[57:10] and you know that well you know she
[57:12] didn't she didn't go to egypt she went
[57:13] they went to moab
[57:15] because you know mo moab's uh they're
[57:18] kind of there you know it's not they're
[57:20] not out in the world
[57:22] you know they're just kind of lukewarm
[57:26] you know they're just kind of church
[57:28] either but they're not in the world
[57:29] world
[57:31] but they're kind of churchy world
[57:34] worldly church
[57:37] so they got they got this little they
[57:38] you know they but you know they go down
[57:39] there because you know they they still
[57:41] don't have their religion
[57:45] but you know what they start getting
[57:46] influenced
[57:49] by the things that surround them
[57:53] and when you get into situations like
[57:55] that then people wonder why things why
[57:57] things always go south on them
[58:00] and here and here they are they're down
[58:02] there and and away from way out of out
[58:05] of their position away from everything
[58:06] they should be in and all of a sudden
[58:08] they go down then they go down into uh
[58:12] moab
[58:13] and they're down there because you know
[58:14] what hey we got to get away from this
[58:15] famine we're enjoying this
[58:18] yeah there's a lot of things going on
[58:20] down here that we don't agree with we
[58:21] don't like
[58:22] but you know what we're making it
[58:27] and this this is this is what that's
[58:28] what we're doing
[58:30] until
[58:32] everything goes bad on them
[58:35] and then all of a sudden
[58:37] naomi's husband dies her sons die and
[58:40] all she's got is two daughters three
[58:41] women stranded
[58:44] out of the place of god
[58:46] and here they are down there and here
[58:48] they are
[58:49] widows
[58:53] and you know and the first thing that we
[58:54] find out from from
[58:57] naomi
[58:58] in the book of ruth you know she's so
[59:00] she's upset and she tells her daughters
[59:03] her daughter-in-laws you need to go back
[59:05] to your kindred you need to go back to
[59:07] your country
[59:10] and and here in the in the scripture you
[59:12] know
[59:13] we know the orpah goes back
[59:17] because you know she she just because
[59:18] you know she was not going to follow any
[59:21] of this
[59:23] you know just like a lot of people you
[59:25] know they they're around it for a while
[59:28] you know just as brother uh diggs was
[59:30] talking about you know they hold on to
[59:32] the word until they get a problem
[59:35] until the word gets choked out because
[59:36] they got a bad situation then they're
[59:38] gone
[59:40] well you know she's there and then she's
[59:42] gone but you know the scripture tells us
[59:45] this is this is from ruth chapter one
[59:49] we're beginning at verse 15
[59:51] and naomi speaking
[59:54] to ruth it says and she said behold uh
[59:57] sister-in-law has gone back unto her
[59:59] people and to her gods
[1:00:02] return thou after thy sister-in-law
[1:00:07] so now she went back to what wherever
[1:00:10] she got to in in god where whether she
[1:00:12] got to whatever she was doing she went
[1:00:15] back to what she knew
[1:00:17] why because you know that was what was
[1:00:18] in her heart
[1:00:23] because that you know hey i'm going back
[1:00:24] i mean i'm enjoying living in the world
[1:00:28] and i like it it it it suits me just
[1:00:31] fine
[1:00:33] but here's roots she says and ruse said
[1:00:35] and treat me not to leave thee
[1:00:38] or to return from following after thee
[1:00:41] for whether thou goest i will go
[1:00:44] and whether thou largest i will lodge
[1:00:47] thy people shall be my people
[1:00:49] and thy god my god
[1:00:51] amen
[1:00:53] now listen to her testimony
[1:00:55] whether thou diest i will die
[1:00:58] and there will i be buried the lord do
[1:01:01] so to me and more also if all but death
[1:01:04] part
[1:01:05] thee and me and when she saw that she
[1:01:08] was steadfastly
[1:01:10] minded
[1:01:12] to go with her then she left speaking
[1:01:15] unto her
[1:01:17] you got to get to the place
[1:01:18] where you sell out
[1:01:21] you got you got to get to a place you
[1:01:22] get steadfast
[1:01:25] it says so they went the two went un
[1:01:28] until they came to bethlehem and it came
[1:01:29] to pass when they were come to bethlehem
[1:01:32] that all the city was moved about them
[1:01:35] and they said is this naomi
[1:01:38] and she said unto them call me not naomi
[1:01:42] call me maura for the almighty hath
[1:01:44] dwelt very bitterly with me
[1:01:47] i went out full and the lord hath
[1:01:49] brought me home again empty
[1:01:53] why then call me
[1:01:55] ye call
[1:01:56] call ye me naomi sing the lord hath
[1:01:59] testified against me and the almighty
[1:02:01] hath afflicted me
[1:02:03] so naomi returned and wrote the
[1:02:05] moabitess her daughter-in-law with her
[1:02:07] being which returned out of the land of
[1:02:10] moab and they came to bethlehem in the
[1:02:12] beginning of barley harvest
[1:02:15] now it's interesting that
[1:02:17] when you see this here here is ruth
[1:02:20] and whatever whatever whatever
[1:02:22] background she had coming out of moab
[1:02:27] and we know there was a kind of a
[1:02:29] lukewarm kind of
[1:02:31] half
[1:02:32] fundamental kind of background
[1:02:36] but you know there was something that
[1:02:37] stirred in ruth
[1:02:40] that when she saw something something
[1:02:42] had to strike her from what she saw but
[1:02:44] she told naomi she said listen no matter
[1:02:46] where you go said your god where where
[1:02:48] wherever you're going i'm going
[1:02:51] he said your god will be my god
[1:02:54] hey she said wherever you die i'm gonna
[1:02:56] die whatever goes it should we're gonna
[1:02:58] be we're gonna do this together
[1:03:00] and you know and naomi was so moved
[1:03:04] by this you know she just she's quit
[1:03:05] trying to talk to ruth because she
[1:03:07] understood where ruth was coming from
[1:03:09] but what's so amazing when she saw this
[1:03:11] then they came to bethlehem
[1:03:15] the house of god's bread
[1:03:17] in barley season
[1:03:20] but you know so then
[1:03:22] listen when all the city was moved
[1:03:26] she came back to where she came from
[1:03:29] naomi came back
[1:03:32] and when she came back in then everybody
[1:03:34] said is this not naomi look naomi's here
[1:03:38] but she came back to where she was
[1:03:40] supposed to be
[1:03:42] she came back into the promised land
[1:03:46] and then when she when she comes back
[1:03:48] then she stands there and she tells them
[1:03:49] she said don't call me naomi
[1:03:52] meaning pleasant
[1:03:54] but she said call me mara which means
[1:03:56] bitter
[1:03:59] she said because god has dealt very
[1:04:00] bitterly with me
[1:04:04] listen this and then this is her
[1:04:06] testimony now listen this is this is
[1:04:07] this is naomi's testimony she says she
[1:04:10] said i went out full and i came back
[1:04:12] empty
[1:04:14] and not realizing that in the midst she
[1:04:17] has ruth standing there with her she
[1:04:19] said i went out full and you know what i
[1:04:21] came back and no she didn't
[1:04:25] she had one that came back with her
[1:04:29] not realizing that she was so she wasn't
[1:04:31] alone she had roof
[1:04:35] and here she is and then she came back
[1:04:37] and then city comes to her
[1:04:41] it's interesting that she comes back to
[1:04:42] bethlehem which is the house of god's
[1:04:44] bread
[1:04:46] in barley season
[1:04:49] the time of the harvest she's coming
[1:04:51] back into the promised land why did she
[1:04:53] go out because of a famine
[1:04:56] here she is she's coming back where the
[1:04:58] word is where the food is where the
[1:05:00] barley is she's coming back
[1:05:03] and she's bringing ruth is coming with
[1:05:05] her
[1:05:06] and she says i went out full but i've
[1:05:08] come back empty
[1:05:11] what she didn't realize that she didn't
[1:05:12] come back empty
[1:05:15] but i think she got rid of a lot of
[1:05:16] things that drove her out
[1:05:19] what drove her out of of the promised
[1:05:21] land that drove her back into moab she
[1:05:23] got rid of that
[1:05:26] because god had to beat all that out of
[1:05:28] her all those things had to pass as she
[1:05:30] came back to her senses to realize where
[1:05:32] she was supposed to be
[1:05:34] when she came back then she come back
[1:05:35] into the land of promise then she come
[1:05:38] back and then then she walks in and then
[1:05:40] they begin to speak to her
[1:05:43] and she's like no i'm bitter
[1:05:46] you're blessed
[1:05:48] and it's just like when when people come
[1:05:50] out of out of whatever problems and
[1:05:52] situations they come to when you come
[1:05:54] into the house of god then you know what
[1:05:56] it's not where people come to judge you
[1:05:58] it's to where people come to put their
[1:05:59] arms around you to embrace you and to
[1:06:01] bring you in to bring you into
[1:06:03] fellowship which is exactly what they
[1:06:05] were trying to do to naomi but she said
[1:06:08] i'm bitter
[1:06:11] and many times when people come to
[1:06:12] church and they have problems and the
[1:06:14] minister is trying to reach out and he's
[1:06:16] trying to reach and give you something
[1:06:20] as brother branham says in the message
[1:06:22] this is from the kinsman redeemer
[1:06:26] he says now then ruth
[1:06:30] was asked to do something that was
[1:06:31] disgraceful but she was willing because
[1:06:33] she had made her decision
[1:06:35] he said what a type of a believer what a
[1:06:37] perfect type naomi the old church said
[1:06:39] go down tonight it's barley season oh
[1:06:41] what a beautiful thought we could hang
[1:06:43] on right there naomi and ruth just come
[1:06:45] in at barley season barley season was
[1:06:48] bread season the season when fresh bread
[1:06:50] was being served and the church in this
[1:06:52] last days through 2 000 years of pagan
[1:06:55] teaching and things has come into it
[1:06:57] barley season freshness of life new
[1:06:59] bread honey out of heaven
[1:07:02] the russell russell talk about honey
[1:07:04] crust bread this is it bread from heaven
[1:07:06] i am the bread of life your fathers did
[1:07:08] eat manna and are dead but i am the
[1:07:10] bread of life that comes from from god
[1:07:13] out of heaven
[1:07:14] if a man eats this bread he'll never die
[1:07:17] and the church in this last days here is
[1:07:19] brought in right now at barley season
[1:07:23] so here's here is here is naomi and ruth
[1:07:25] they're coming in at barley season and
[1:07:28] here is here's god speaking to them and
[1:07:30] saying listen there's a place for bread
[1:07:32] here's the bread of life
[1:07:34] so god is speaking to her and of her and
[1:07:37] her need
[1:07:38] and all she can do is look at her
[1:07:40] problems and say i am i'm very bitter
[1:07:42] because what's happened
[1:07:44] not realizing she's come back and god is
[1:07:46] trying to speak to her
[1:07:49] many times we hold on to our problems
[1:07:51] and you know we as we sing the song take
[1:07:53] your burdens to the lord and leave them
[1:07:55] there but you know what we don't we want
[1:07:56] to have a party to do with it too we
[1:07:58] don't want to give up control
[1:08:00] come on but we come into the house of
[1:08:02] god and you know what there's
[1:08:04] there's bread from heaven the manna of
[1:08:06] god is dropped down and when he's trying
[1:08:08] to give it to you we're too worried
[1:08:10] about our problems and other things that
[1:08:12] we're not going to hold on to the word
[1:08:14] of god
[1:08:16] but here she comes she comes in to this
[1:08:19] time
[1:08:21] and here she is
[1:08:22] they bring her in
[1:08:24] and we know the story how how here she's
[1:08:26] come in
[1:08:28] and
[1:08:29] you know she she's
[1:08:32] so bitter
[1:08:34] she has all these issues
[1:08:37] but you know there's an interesting
[1:08:39] thing that uh that i i noticed i was
[1:08:41] reading this in the scripture and and
[1:08:43] and ruth and you know
[1:08:45] you brother ram talks about having
[1:08:47] fellowship
[1:08:48] and we'll get to it in a minute but you
[1:08:50] know when you when you look at naomi
[1:08:53] you know no no and if you can find it
[1:08:55] just show them to me i'll be glad to
[1:08:56] read but you know there's no place in
[1:08:58] the scripture that i can find naomi's
[1:09:00] ever with anybody
[1:09:04] she comes back in to the land of promise
[1:09:07] and the only person you ever see her
[1:09:09] interact with is ruth
[1:09:12] but you know what ruth
[1:09:14] ruth got into the land of promise
[1:09:16] and guess what
[1:09:18] she ain't laying around
[1:09:19] she got her feet propped up first thing
[1:09:21] she does she's out in a barley field
[1:09:24] why because you know what we've come
[1:09:26] through we've come through this this
[1:09:28] famine we've had all these problems and
[1:09:30] guess what i get in a field and i'm out
[1:09:32] there because you know what god's law is
[1:09:34] already provided for me
[1:09:37] you know the the old testament law told
[1:09:39] them said listen you can't cut the
[1:09:40] corners out you can you can't do all
[1:09:42] these things one because the strangers
[1:09:44] and the poor and everything they eat
[1:09:46] from your field and you leave this for
[1:09:48] them god already had already made
[1:09:49] provision for them
[1:09:52] and here they they go out into the field
[1:09:54] and they start
[1:09:56] gathering here she is out gathering from
[1:09:58] from the field and she don't even know
[1:09:59] where she's at she just knows hey i'm a
[1:10:01] field and guess what i've come out of a
[1:10:03] famine and i'm enjoying this
[1:10:08] hey listen and listen here and all of a
[1:10:11] sudden then all of a sudden here's boaz
[1:10:14] boaz comes on the scene and boaz sees
[1:10:16] her and says who is this woman
[1:10:20] like you didn't know who it was
[1:10:22] if the whole city come and saw naomi and
[1:10:24] this other woman come in i i'm pretty
[1:10:26] sure boaz knew who she was
[1:10:29] but you know it's so amazing
[1:10:31] he comes and speaks to to ruth
[1:10:34] and says listen don't go to any other
[1:10:36] field
[1:10:41] and he tells the young man and until he
[1:10:42] says listen the young man of drone water
[1:10:44] you drink all you want
[1:10:46] you know brother branham types to talk
[1:10:48] to those young men for drawing water out
[1:10:49] of the fivefold ministry
[1:10:52] draw water out
[1:10:55] and so later on when they're asking
[1:10:57] about when they're asking boaz is asking
[1:10:59] the the men about ruth you know they
[1:11:02] said well other than she spent a little
[1:11:03] time in the house
[1:11:05] she's been in the field
[1:11:06] because you know what
[1:11:08] you can work all you want to but you
[1:11:09] know what it's nice to have a little
[1:11:10] fellowship
[1:11:13] she's out there fellowshipping but you
[1:11:15] know what she's working
[1:11:16] she's getting
[1:11:17] but you know what he tells him he said
[1:11:18] listen wherever wherever you see ruth
[1:11:20] out there in the field he said make sure
[1:11:22] you leave something
[1:11:23] leave a little word for you know what
[1:11:26] it's not it's not all that's gleaning
[1:11:27] guess what you're gonna leave hand fills
[1:11:29] of purpose
[1:11:30] you're gonna leave hands fulls
[1:11:32] why here's a little meet and do season
[1:11:35] here's a little meet and do season
[1:11:38] here's a little something for you
[1:11:40] a little extra
[1:11:46] here's naomi she's
[1:11:48] she's licking her wounds
[1:11:50] ruth's come out of a famine and she's
[1:11:52] having a blast
[1:11:55] and you know what the lord is watching
[1:11:57] over her the whole time
[1:12:04] see it's so important
[1:12:06] to have fellowship
[1:12:09] don't get tied up in in things you know
[1:12:11] because
[1:12:12] you know people they have they have hard
[1:12:14] times and and different things
[1:12:18] but you know what don't don't get out of
[1:12:20] fellowship
[1:12:22] don't get out of fellowship with god
[1:12:24] don't get out of fellowship with the
[1:12:25] believers
[1:12:29] see you you got to come to a place and
[1:12:31] you've got to have the right kind of
[1:12:32] fellowship
[1:12:35] this this is from the message thirsting
[1:12:37] for life
[1:12:40] brother brown says you know some people
[1:12:42] say i couldn't
[1:12:43] i i wouldn't belong to one of those full
[1:12:45] gospel churches they cry and shout and
[1:12:47] jerk their hands around and things like
[1:12:49] that that's all right they may act funny
[1:12:51] but they're but they've been born
[1:12:54] they may look like a mess but they got
[1:12:56] life that's the thing
[1:12:58] as long as you've got life ask one of
[1:13:00] them if he's satisfied watch the way he
[1:13:02] acts the places he goes
[1:13:04] he said you know the bird by its habits
[1:13:08] a crow and a dove could not have could
[1:13:10] have no fellowship their diet's
[1:13:12] different
[1:13:13] and a christian can't mix with the world
[1:13:16] a crow's a hypocrite a hypocrite is a
[1:13:18] deceiver a crow can sit on an old dead
[1:13:21] carcass and eat all day long and fly out
[1:13:23] in a wheat field and eat wheat with the
[1:13:25] doves but the dove cannot eat wheat
[1:13:28] but he can't
[1:13:30] but he can't eat the dead carcass
[1:13:32] why he can't he hasn't got any gall
[1:13:36] he couldn't digest it and he said that's
[1:13:39] the way
[1:13:40] the way with a christian the bitterness
[1:13:42] is taken from him
[1:13:44] he couldn't digest the world but a
[1:13:46] hypocrite can live in sin all day long
[1:13:48] and come into church at night and shout
[1:13:50] like the rest of them that's a hypocrite
[1:13:54] now when you're born again you don't you
[1:13:57] don't have to be a hypocrite you're a
[1:13:58] new creature a new creature
[1:14:01] the gall of bitterness the desire of the
[1:14:04] world is taken from you
[1:14:06] oh thy loving kindness is better than
[1:14:08] life because i long to see thy power
[1:14:10] like i have seen in thy sanctuary my
[1:14:13] soul thirsts after thee like a dry land
[1:14:16] where no water is david was a shepherd
[1:14:19] he was a woodsman he knew the action of
[1:14:22] wildlife
[1:14:26] so i know i'm not gonna read the rest of
[1:14:29] it there but um
[1:14:32] i i just i just love that but you know
[1:14:34] when he talks about the gall of
[1:14:36] bitterness
[1:14:38] you know you know a crow and other
[1:14:40] animals they can have this this
[1:14:43] gall
[1:14:44] a gallbladder
[1:14:46] you know because you know that's what it
[1:14:47] produces
[1:14:49] it produces a bile
[1:14:52] you know for it to break down and you
[1:14:54] got to have that if you go if you go eat
[1:14:56] all
[1:14:56] you know especially if you're going to
[1:14:58] eat dead carcass
[1:15:01] i like eating some dead carcass
[1:15:07] cooked
[1:15:08] that's right
[1:15:12] yeah
[1:15:13] you know
[1:15:14] somebody was talking about that somebody
[1:15:15] was talking about uh eating sushi eating
[1:15:18] sushi eating sushi
[1:15:22] i've tried it i told him i said i like
[1:15:24] my sushi southern fried that's right
[1:15:27] that's my revelation right there
[1:15:29] [Laughter]
[1:15:33] but you know i i like me some dead
[1:15:35] carcass about medium
[1:15:38] but you know what if you eat a lot of
[1:15:40] that you're going to need some help
[1:15:42] and god made god give you something to
[1:15:44] help break that down
[1:15:47] but you know what god didn't if you're a
[1:15:49] new creature a new creation in christ
[1:15:51] jesus you know what the desire of the
[1:15:53] world you don't have any goal
[1:15:57] that gall of bitterness
[1:15:59] because you know all you know all of
[1:16:00] that's bitter
[1:16:02] and it breaks all that stuff down where
[1:16:05] you can stomach that stuff
[1:16:07] but you know what if you're if you're a
[1:16:08] new creature in christ you know you
[1:16:10] don't you can't stomach the world
[1:16:12] you don't have any desire for the world
[1:16:16] like he said that crow now he can be he
[1:16:18] can be a hypocrite he can get out there
[1:16:20] and eat anything and just swallow it all
[1:16:22] down but then he can go out there and
[1:16:23] eat with eat with a dove
[1:16:26] but you know what you're not eating that
[1:16:29] out fellowshipping and all of that
[1:16:32] it ain't got no part in any of that
[1:16:36] and it's the same way with us you know
[1:16:38] when you when you have been changed when
[1:16:40] you've come this then you know what it's
[1:16:42] time to get rid of all of the bitterness
[1:16:45] because that's not that's not a part
[1:16:47] that's not a part of a christian
[1:16:49] to get rid of all of that god made a way
[1:16:52] and if you're born again then that's
[1:16:53] gone
[1:16:57] ephesians 4 30 says
[1:17:00] he says and grieve not the holy spirit
[1:17:02] of god whereby ye are sealed until the
[1:17:04] day of redemption
[1:17:06] he said let all bitterness and wrath and
[1:17:08] anger and clamor and evil speaking
[1:17:12] be put away from you with all malice
[1:17:16] now listen now this this is because i i
[1:17:19] want to read something here in a minute
[1:17:21] that
[1:17:21] because you know what
[1:17:23] why did paul say this
[1:17:27] because you know what you got to be
[1:17:28] careful you got to be on your guard
[1:17:33] because there's a time coming
[1:17:36] that the devil devil's always got his
[1:17:38] aim at you and he's always coming
[1:17:44] no he said he said now you're sealed
[1:17:46] until the day of redemption
[1:17:48] but he said now let all this stuff go
[1:17:51] because that's not that's not part of
[1:17:52] the holy ghost
[1:17:54] and he says and be ye kind one to
[1:17:56] another tenderhearted forgiving one
[1:17:58] another even as god for christ's sake
[1:18:01] hath forgiven you
[1:18:04] so when you hold you can't hold on to
[1:18:05] resentment you can't hold on to these
[1:18:07] things
[1:18:09] but you know what
[1:18:10] don't don't think the devil ain't out
[1:18:11] there trying
[1:18:18] so you got to you got to be in
[1:18:19] fellowship
[1:18:22] i want to read from this this comes from
[1:18:24] the smyrna church age message
[1:18:28] 1960.
[1:18:30] and brother brown was talking about
[1:18:32] he said when i first started out as a
[1:18:34] baptist preacher they come around saying
[1:18:36] brother adam you got to come over here
[1:18:37] and we got it and we carried it over
[1:18:39] here
[1:18:40] he said neither one of you
[1:18:43] i stand right between the two groups say
[1:18:44] we are brothers
[1:18:46] don't care what i don't care if a man
[1:18:49] disagrees
[1:18:51] that don't make one speck of difference
[1:18:53] to me he's still my brother
[1:18:55] he said i got a brother that likes apple
[1:18:57] pie
[1:18:58] amen
[1:19:00] i like cherry the best but i ain't going
[1:19:02] to disfellowship him
[1:19:04] he can eat his apple pie and i can eat
[1:19:07] my cherry pie
[1:19:09] now i i like brother i like brother
[1:19:11] brown's way eating
[1:19:12] he said i put class
[1:19:14] calf slobbers on top of mine
[1:19:17] if he don't want it why he don't have to
[1:19:18] you know what that
[1:19:20] what is it whip stuff they put on you
[1:19:22] know
[1:19:23] whipped cream i like whipped cream i
[1:19:25] like it
[1:19:26] amen brother
[1:19:28] getting too old now to eat it
[1:19:31] but i i that's what i like and if he
[1:19:34] don't like it well he don't have to eat
[1:19:36] it that's all right
[1:19:38] i'll eat mine but he's still my brother
[1:19:41] that's right so
[1:19:42] i like that i like fellowship
[1:19:44] but when we draw lines like this and say
[1:19:46] no this is our denomination i won't
[1:19:49] reach over and shake hands with the next
[1:19:50] man and say god bless you brother my
[1:19:53] that's when you call fellowship
[1:19:56] if you don't you get that root of
[1:19:58] bitterness just like the smyrnan's hat
[1:20:01] got back there and you caused the same
[1:20:03] thing all right so their name was
[1:20:05] bitter
[1:20:08] the smyrna and church age when they got
[1:20:10] into that when they got out of
[1:20:11] fellowship
[1:20:12] then their name was they were brother
[1:20:14] that god called them bitter
[1:20:16] because they were out of fellowship
[1:20:20] he said he didn't matter what it was he
[1:20:22] said we're all eating
[1:20:23] we're all brothers we're all gonna
[1:20:24] fellowship
[1:20:26] you draw me out your circle i'm gonna
[1:20:28] draw mine bigger
[1:20:31] brother brown talks about in one place
[1:20:33] where he talks about um
[1:20:36] when you go through and you know we we
[1:20:38] come before god and we go in and he said
[1:20:41] uh
[1:20:42] nursing from el shaddai and you you
[1:20:44] began to draw he said and draw in the
[1:20:46] holy ghost
[1:20:47] and then he was talking about drawing in
[1:20:49] meekness and gentleness and all these
[1:20:51] other things just drawing all these
[1:20:52] things in
[1:20:53] he said when you begin to draw all these
[1:20:55] things in he said then god's got a
[1:20:57] grubbing hoe
[1:20:59] he said he's going to grub out the root
[1:21:01] of bitterness
[1:21:02] we're going to get rid of that thing
[1:21:05] when we get in one because when you get
[1:21:07] into fellowship then you know what
[1:21:08] that's god that's that's the plan
[1:21:12] when you begin to get into the
[1:21:13] atmosphere of god get into the word and
[1:21:16] you have fellowship then you know what
[1:21:17] then god's in there digging all that
[1:21:19] stuff out
[1:21:21] amen when you're out of fellowship then
[1:21:23] you know what there's a problem
[1:21:27] because that's what god wants us here he
[1:21:28] wants us here so we can have fellowship
[1:21:30] because he's going to get rid of all
[1:21:31] that stuff
[1:21:37] and this is this is one that's what i
[1:21:39] wanted to read
[1:21:41] this is this is one thing that i always
[1:21:43] always go back to
[1:21:45] this is from christ the mystery this is
[1:21:46] this is the word of the church that that
[1:21:48] most people call the word of the church
[1:21:50] that brother branham reads
[1:21:51] when he's speaking in christ the mystery
[1:21:58] he said
[1:21:59] and i didn't read the whole thing but he
[1:22:00] said but you remember that
[1:22:03] the enemy will come and when he does
[1:22:04] just cling that much closer together
[1:22:07] the one that the devil is using for an
[1:22:10] enemy will either get out or come in and
[1:22:12] be one of you that's all
[1:22:14] he said don't never clan among you or
[1:22:18] talk or make yourself clandest we are
[1:22:19] one i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at
[1:22:22] you i'm not going to take you i'm going
[1:22:24] to take you away because you're not my
[1:22:26] right hand he's my left hand i want him
[1:22:28] to stay there even the little tip of my
[1:22:30] finger i want to stay right there
[1:22:34] let me tell you if you
[1:22:35] that you know one of the most painful
[1:22:38] cuts they say is a paper cut and i've
[1:22:40] had a few of them
[1:22:42] may i tell you what
[1:22:43] send you through the roof sometimes
[1:22:46] and it's just a little i i cut my finger
[1:22:48] washing dishes years ago cut the whole
[1:22:51] end of my finger right there off
[1:22:54] and
[1:22:55] it changes your life
[1:22:59] i'm i'm 48 years old and it's been
[1:23:03] almost 40 years and
[1:23:05] i still remember that
[1:23:07] why it changes it changes i want
[1:23:10] everything to stay where it's at
[1:23:13] even my little tip of finger i wanted to
[1:23:15] stay there even every little part of my
[1:23:18] body stay right there and god wants us
[1:23:20] as a body of believers to stay right
[1:23:22] exactly with one another right with one
[1:23:24] another he said now we've got tapes on
[1:23:27] that well you've got tapes on what we
[1:23:28] believe we've got tapes on discipline in
[1:23:30] the church and how we behave ourselves
[1:23:32] in the church of god how we got to come
[1:23:35] here together and sit in heavenly places
[1:23:45] he said how we behave ourselves in the
[1:23:47] church of god and how we got to come
[1:23:50] here together and sit together in
[1:23:53] heavenly places
[1:23:56] as as brother ernie used to say we're
[1:23:59] standing on the promises not sitting on
[1:24:01] the premises
[1:24:04] don't stay home
[1:24:07] i know you were quoting it i'm going to
[1:24:08] read it
[1:24:09] if god is in your heart you can't hardly
[1:24:11] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[1:24:13] to get in here to fellowship with your
[1:24:15] brothers if you don't feel that way then
[1:24:18] i tell you it's time you got to praying
[1:24:21] because we're in the last days where the
[1:24:23] bible exalted or exhorted us to much
[1:24:26] more as we see the day approaching
[1:24:30] to love one another with christian love
[1:24:32] and divine love to assemble ourselves
[1:24:34] together in heavenly places in christ
[1:24:37] jesus and love one another this will all
[1:24:40] men know you are my disciples when you
[1:24:42] have love one for the other that's right
[1:24:44] stay right together if the brother you
[1:24:47] think so he's a little wrong or the
[1:24:50] sister say lord don't
[1:24:52] let me never have the root of bitterness
[1:24:56] spring up because listen to this listen
[1:24:59] that's what i i yeah i've heard this but
[1:25:02] this is what struck me it'll affect him
[1:25:06] it'll take the christ right out of my
[1:25:09] life
[1:25:10] that poison acids of malice and jealousy
[1:25:13] and hatred that will just take the holy
[1:25:17] spirit right away from you
[1:25:19] it will run him from the tabernacle here
[1:25:22] it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it
[1:25:24] away from here hurt your pastor it'll do
[1:25:27] everything see don't do that
[1:25:30] you just wax that much closer draw take
[1:25:33] the buckle as the brother testified a
[1:25:34] minister here the other night about
[1:25:36] having a buckle sing in a vision just
[1:25:39] that buckles on the whole armor of god
[1:25:41] just pull her on tighten up move right
[1:25:44] up close one another to one another love
[1:25:47] one another anyhow talk nice about one
[1:25:49] another say nice things about one
[1:25:51] another then god will bless you
[1:25:55] don't ever let the root of bitterness
[1:25:57] come in
[1:26:00] because you know if we allow just the
[1:26:03] little things
[1:26:06] because i want you to look at that it
[1:26:08] wasn't it wasn't it was the root
[1:26:10] of bitterness
[1:26:13] it was it wasn't a it wasn't a
[1:26:15] tree it wasn't a plant it wasn't it's
[1:26:17] the root
[1:26:19] the root of bitterness
[1:26:21] just how small is that when it when when
[1:26:24] you let the devil get a foothold
[1:26:26] a toehold
[1:26:28] that he said he said look look what it
[1:26:30] drive the holy spirit away it'll do
[1:26:32] it'll do everything
[1:26:34] it'll it'll it'll tear everything up
[1:26:38] but you know brother brown said when he
[1:26:40] was when he was speaking he said listen
[1:26:41] he said he'll bring somebody in
[1:26:44] under the quietness
[1:26:46] and bring him in he'll fellowship with
[1:26:48] y'all
[1:26:49] and he said he'll shoot him full of
[1:26:50] deadly poison
[1:26:54] and he said don't take sides with it
[1:26:58] why don't don't allow the devil to have
[1:27:01] a spot where that root of bitterness
[1:27:03] will take place
[1:27:05] because you know i i'm here to i'm here
[1:27:07] to say i i've i've had issues
[1:27:10] lord i i've you know because i
[1:27:13] i i i need i need that i need that grub
[1:27:15] hole lord
[1:27:17] there's been times in my life i you know
[1:27:19] i i still battle things
[1:27:23] i want that grub hole to come along i
[1:27:25] want him to get all that stuff out
[1:27:28] i don't i don't i don't want any malice
[1:27:30] any i don't want anything that's going
[1:27:31] to hinder the move of god that's going
[1:27:33] to hinder the work of god i don't want i
[1:27:35] don't want anything that's going to stop
[1:27:36] it whatever it is because i don't want i
[1:27:39] don't want the root of bitterness i
[1:27:40] don't want i don't want any of these
[1:27:41] things
[1:27:43] i want i want these things to have that
[1:27:45] have their perfect way the perfect place
[1:27:49] i want i want it to work just so this in
[1:27:51] the perfect
[1:27:52] plan of god
[1:27:54] everything to have its way
[1:28:02] so
[1:28:03] anyway
[1:28:05] we'll finish here
[1:28:09] and
[1:28:10] we uh
[1:28:12] we know the story of
[1:28:15] ruth
[1:28:16] how
[1:28:17] how boaz comes and
[1:28:19] you know he
[1:28:20] he deals with her and
[1:28:23] and gives her
[1:28:25] the six measures of of barley and all
[1:28:28] the things that
[1:28:29] how he comes and
[1:28:31] you know
[1:28:32] then when it come time to you know he
[1:28:35] realized that had to do something
[1:28:38] he had to redeem naomi
[1:28:42] and you know there was a and because of
[1:28:44] what took place and and so
[1:28:47] when she lost everything she had to have
[1:28:49] somebody she had to have a near kinsman
[1:28:51] for for redemption
[1:28:54] and so you know boaz he come he went to
[1:28:56] the to the nearer kinsmen
[1:28:59] and told him said listen he said it it
[1:29:01] you can you can do the right of
[1:29:02] redemption
[1:29:04] but we know that that he didn't want
[1:29:06] that he didn't want to mess up his his
[1:29:08] uh inheritance he didn't want to mess up
[1:29:10] any of this
[1:29:13] so he so he laid his hands off he said
[1:29:15] the devil didn't want any of that
[1:29:18] he don't want to mess up his his kingdom
[1:29:20] he don't mess up his inheritance or
[1:29:22] anything like that but you know the one
[1:29:24] that wanted
[1:29:26] was christ
[1:29:29] christ wanted to redeem to redeem naomi
[1:29:33] and get ruth
[1:29:38] and here ruth chapter four
[1:29:40] beginning at verse nine it says and boaz
[1:29:42] said unto the elders because you know he
[1:29:44] knew what he had to do
[1:29:46] when ruth came to him on the threshing
[1:29:48] floor and came and bowed down
[1:29:52] you know she had a desire
[1:29:54] for boaz
[1:29:57] and she wanted she wanted
[1:30:00] and and he knew what he had to do
[1:30:04] to bring her back in into full
[1:30:06] inheritance
[1:30:09] and when boaz goes and says and said
[1:30:11] unto the elders and unto the people ye
[1:30:14] are witnesses this day that i have
[1:30:16] bought all that was a limoulex and all
[1:30:19] that was chileans and melons which is
[1:30:22] naomi's husband
[1:30:24] and then that's orpas
[1:30:26] and
[1:30:27] ruth's husband
[1:30:29] of the hand of naomi
[1:30:32] so moreover the roof ruth the moabite
[1:30:35] the wife of maelon have i purchased to
[1:30:37] be the one to be my wife to raise up the
[1:30:40] name of the dead upon his inheritance
[1:30:46] because that was the old testament
[1:30:49] to raise up to raise up the name of the
[1:30:50] one that was dead
[1:30:53] to bring them back into their
[1:30:54] inheritance
[1:30:56] that the name of the dead be not cut off
[1:30:58] from among his brethren and from the
[1:31:01] gate of his place you witness ye are
[1:31:03] witnesses this day and all the people
[1:31:05] that were in the gate and the elder said
[1:31:07] we are witnesses
[1:31:09] the lord make the woman that is come
[1:31:12] into thy house not house like rachel and
[1:31:15] like leah which two did build the house
[1:31:18] of israel and do thou worthily in
[1:31:22] ephrata
[1:31:23] and be famous in bethlehem
[1:31:26] and let thy house be like the house of
[1:31:29] pharas whom tamar bear unto judah of the
[1:31:32] seed which the lord shall give thee of
[1:31:34] this young woman so boaz took ruth
[1:31:37] and she was his wife and when she went
[1:31:40] and when he went unto her the lord gave
[1:31:42] her conception and she bear a son
[1:31:44] and the women said unto naomi
[1:31:48] now listen to this blessed be the lord
[1:31:51] which hath not left thee
[1:31:55] then naomi had a reminder a lot of other
[1:31:57] things and she was bitter
[1:31:59] because what had happened
[1:32:01] and she didn't see the plan of god what
[1:32:03] was taking place around her
[1:32:06] he said
[1:32:09] and she shall
[1:32:10] and he shall be unto thee
[1:32:13] blessed be the name of which hath not
[1:32:15] left thee this day without a kinsmen
[1:32:17] that his name may be famous in israel
[1:32:20] and he shall be unto thee a restorer of
[1:32:22] thy life and the nourisher of thine old
[1:32:25] age for thy daughter-in-law which loveth
[1:32:28] thee which is better to thee than seven
[1:32:30] son
[1:32:31] sons hath borne him and naomi took the
[1:32:34] child and laid him in her bosom and
[1:32:37] became nurse unto it
[1:32:39] and the women her neighbors gave
[1:32:43] gave it a name saying there is a son
[1:32:45] born to naomi and they called his name
[1:32:48] obit
[1:32:49] and he is the father of jesse the father
[1:32:52] of david
[1:32:55] and the name of
[1:32:59] i was going
[1:33:05] i can't remember
[1:33:06] anyway i'll look it up
[1:33:08] but anyway i was going to remember what
[1:33:09] the name of obed meant that i forgot but
[1:33:12] anyway
[1:33:14] but here is here is this one
[1:33:17] that naomi
[1:33:19] had went through all of this bitterness
[1:33:22] and here and here is
[1:33:24] all all this that took place
[1:33:27] and then
[1:33:28] here is the one that was so
[1:33:31] close to her
[1:33:35] and here's boaz giving
[1:33:40] redeeming naomi to get roof
[1:33:43] and here he is bringing a child forth
[1:33:46] under their inheritance
[1:33:48] bringing them back
[1:33:50] and giving that child to naomi
[1:33:54] to raise
[1:33:57] it's a beautiful it's a beautiful type
[1:33:59] because you know
[1:34:00] the old in the old
[1:34:02] testament you know the old testament the
[1:34:05] jews were the ones that brought the
[1:34:06] christian brought the gospel to us to
[1:34:09] the jews
[1:34:11] and in the last days this message
[1:34:14] will come from the gentiles
[1:34:16] and go back to naomi
[1:34:19] we'll give back them their inheritance
[1:34:22] they will they will see the the seed of
[1:34:25] redemption they will they will see the
[1:34:28] fullness of redemption
[1:34:30] as as obed came
[1:34:32] and was the fulfillment of the word that
[1:34:34] came to fill with them jesus christ
[1:34:37] this man this message
[1:34:40] the word will come back to them and
[1:34:42] they'll see
[1:34:43] the fullness of redemption
[1:34:47] amen god bless you tonight
[1:34:49] appreciate the lord and
[1:34:54] serving
[1:34:55] oh thank you brother
[1:34:58] they just they're just too good
[1:35:02] amen they're just too good i tell you i
[1:35:04] appreciate that
[1:35:07] how how god is so good to us
[1:35:10] and i i i wanted to say sister sister
[1:35:12] julie's here tonight so uh
[1:35:16] this this would be something for sis
[1:35:17] julie
[1:35:18] when i when i preached on rahab
[1:35:21] she was talking about she said did you
[1:35:24] know
[1:35:25] or did you have that plan that when you
[1:35:27] were talking about rahab coming through
[1:35:30] and then it was on mother's day and then
[1:35:32] we got to the end i said she was the
[1:35:34] matriarch of the kings
[1:35:36] and i said yeah i knew that ahead of
[1:35:37] time but i didn't tell that up front
[1:35:38] because i had to had to wait to the end
[1:35:40] to tell that because you know it's just
[1:35:42] like reading a book you got to get all
[1:35:43] the way through then
[1:35:44] to find the ending
[1:35:47] but y'all i was i was talking about
[1:35:50] sister julie talking about well you know
[1:35:54] i i was thinking about it today
[1:35:56] being being been this is mother's day
[1:35:59] month
[1:36:00] and i was thinking about uh
[1:36:03] rachel or rehab bringing forth
[1:36:06] rahab brought forth boaz
[1:36:10] and so there and so there's there's the
[1:36:13] type of of mother being again because
[1:36:15] hannah was one that was
[1:36:17] barren but god gave her
[1:36:19] a seed which was
[1:36:21] samuel
[1:36:22] he was the one that
[1:36:24] uh anointed david
[1:36:28] and so we see how
[1:36:32] rahab and ruth was
[1:36:34] you know salmon and rahab boaz boaz and
[1:36:38] ruth brought obid then it was jesse
[1:36:40] and then david
[1:36:42] brought forth the kings
[1:36:45] you know when we look back over things
[1:36:46] in our lives and we think it's
[1:36:49] we don't understand and
[1:36:51] maybe we do have times we have
[1:36:52] bitterness and and things but you know
[1:36:54] what
[1:36:55] just hold on
[1:37:00] god will wake away god is on the
[1:37:04] scene if it won't be if i tell you i
[1:37:07] promise you one thing if don't get right
[1:37:09] on this side it'll be right on that side
[1:37:11] on the other side one of these days
[1:37:13] it'll be all right
[1:37:14] everything god bless you tonight we'll
[1:37:16] all stand and have musicians come and
