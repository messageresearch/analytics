revelations 1 then now remember the announcements the Lord willing brother Lewis will be ministering forest this coming Wednesday not to kind of give us a testimony an olive have their trip and things

we thank you in Jesus name Amen first Peter one who just read will just go ahead and read verse 13 cuz that's our main point so go ahead roll it up we'll just read verse 13 to pick up our main point from it okay you got it there you go alright and he says we're for gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ amen now let's go over into revelations 1 and then we'll start reading in verse 12 and try to pick up our thoughts that we've been dealing on you remember this is the Isle of Patmos and remember the background is that it's the unveiling of the Word of God coming to John that was not we would say previously really written you know and we'll get back to that in a minute it's about the writing of the Bible and things and as it comes forth in the beginning it's letting us know who he is all right now we've covered that we brought over to her point and I thought but then you get over just a little bit in it too about the eighth verse and it stops and it starts dealing with what is John is seeing now the point the main point will be to see you know what takes place the first is too revealing of Jesus Christ me and Almighty God all right then you can see where he goes all right we're going to be dealing with a little word there called in Moorthy which means change in form all right see it doesn't mean change Persinger what change in form it's what you're being revealed at one time and then you change your form so we're going to that thought so okay now let's read verse starting with verse 12 you remember John's here too right and what does he do and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man now notice one lakh under the son of man I didn't say the person clothed with the garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle in his head and his hair were white like wool it's white it's known his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine rice as they were burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters from Kay listen right there and just go ahead into the service and you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word and we've been on this talk for quite a while this is message number five coming forth to talking about the writing of the Bible all right now I've emphasized if we're gonna believe Hebrews 13:8 then Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever alright so now then in there can't be anything new or added to or thoughts we're not talking about something like that about writing of the Bible we're talking about when it is actually being written not talking about the point of you know the adding to or anything the book of Revelation is not an audition no and you can't add to the word cut if you add to the word then God will add the plagues right so we don't go that away so we're going to the point of thinking about the writing of the Bible all right and I tried to get a few points to you to think about it that here's Moses writing and he writes the first five books of the Bible and he's actually writing two thousand or maybe almost three thousand years after at the beginning right so he's going from where he's at all the way back 3,000 years telling us what takes place all right now that's how great the writing of the Word of God it's got it'll show the pies but it shows the present and that's what we always miss we missed the present part and then it shows the future all right it's easy to look back see what has been and then it's easy to look forward to try to follow that that is to hopefully come as we think or get our own ideas but it's hard to follow in where we're at right now all right now get the point as I said we're not talking about an addition to the Word of God we're not talking about that we're actually talking about the writing of the word and trying to show how that Moses could tell what happened in Genesis because he was led of God to write all right but then there was a time that he was right there and they said who's to take it out he said I am so now let's get up and go there was a present tense all right but there was a future time to come to where that they would eventually get out of Egypt you know and go to the promised land all right as I said we want to go back dire we want to go over here but we miss the middle part of it so that's you know that is our our doing I want you to think on this little thought will get out as we get through into the message John is writing to the seven churches all right now so he's riding from where he was which was somewhere about 80 95 96 something like that is the writing of John on Patmos all right but he's writing you know and he gives some things that was but then he's dealing with something that's present tense as we get into this about one standing and what he saw all right then the future comes you know that he tells about what is to take place down through the ages all right now I'll get to this thought in a minute cause the Prophet said it like this he said Paul wrote about the life and the times of the ages all right now listen to one saying he didn't write about the church ages he wrote about what was their present that represented because he wrote to the Ephesians the Galatians the Philippians he wrote to you know the churches the Corinthians and and what I like is is Paul writing to the Corinthians he's actually writing to the lady of seon's because that's where we're at all right do you get the point now Paul wrote of what was dire all right and he wrote letters to the churches all over okay all right but John when he comes to Patmos he writes of what has been what is taking place and the future see most of Paul's writing was what was present tense alright but John was writing the Pais the present in the future okay now we can deal as I said with the Pais we can deal with the future but what we need to do is deal with what as we go along in the the seeing the word as it unfolds and as we do then we can see that you know that the Bible is not being handwritten the mower now but it's being made manifest all right now as I said about Moses he saw what was back there he pinned it okay but that wasn't made manifest for some time he all right they were in Egypt they went and they done this and all happened in the Genesis all right we see then they come a time that it was present tense because it was something taking place all right now surely he wrote then of the future all right that's fine because he would write the future of what's coming and to see that then you would would you don't add to the Bible all right the Bible was actually written before the foundation of the world is that true now or I'll see it's not something to be you that can't add to it you can't take away from it so we're not talking about something like that we're talking about seeing a time God would write about something but dienes then it comes a time that God makes that manifest all right so when you're taking it and making it manifest that's your present tense all right and see what I'm trying to get you and I to do is one thing the Prophet preached a message called recognizing your day and it's message in other words recognize where you're at okay see then the Bible is speaking of what you've done today it wrote about it back under what you know what can't we think of it simple you from Alabama you got up an hour earlier you lost time coming across but see you got up you got ready you come to church that's something present tens all right that's the reality and see that's where we live we don't live in the pice because that's our problem there's like driving down the highway looking through the rearview mirror you know see you're gonna wreck up we appreciate the past all right we don't live in the future cuz that's yet to come we believe it will be there because God said it'll be there alright but the thing that I'm trying to get you to see is right now you can talk about the church ages you can talk about you know seeing what it is but seeing present tense a reality of what's taking place that's my whole goal of this little point I told you we'd do a little series part about the church ages and that's my whole goal is to get you and I to not look back or look forward but to look where we are and see where we're at and see what's taking place see if the Bible says that okay we can read it that you know we can go back and I read it when the towers falled and the words gonna come forward well then we seen it follow season that those things you can find a lot of realities but that's what everybody wants to find those type of things they want to find something that's going to take place some way to where they can see them instead of walking day by day because God is not in the future and God is not in the past if he is the I am brother done a real good job together not talking about I am see if he is the I am that spoke to Moses and if he is the I am that when Jesus said before ever had was I am if that's the same I am then why not stay present tense we don't need to look to what a tomorrow is oh that's where people see they'll get when this election comes up and it runs out you know and what another year or two or something anyhow everybody in the message will start here comes a woman to be present in and see warmer never gets to be President we're gonna be in the end uh uh you're deceived you're in the end the woman's already been president woman's been president a long time ago he said no no they ain't will see you're not looking at it like I'm looking at it I'm looking at who runs the show ain't looking to who's doing it I'm looking at the fact that who's doing what's taking place and you look it's it's doing it alright now then to think about seeing something made manifest all right as I said to you about it see the letter the Bible says you know Paul says the letter killeth all right we love it but it'll kill you okay the Prophet said it like this which is what Paul was saying mister letter killeth what did the prophets say about he said long as it lays on the pages of that book he said it can be questioned oh you can't question the Word of God no I know the Word of God is right it's me I'm questioning all right it's my understanding all right but see as long as it's laying on a page you know then it's something to come all right so that won't work because we don't believe in going on into the future part of it all right but see when we can get to the realisation of realizing right where we're at where we're living and the day that we're living the time we're here on earth do you think we can realize realization and say we're here see it you can go back in the Bible and you can read it and see how it does speak toward the future amen there's a lot of things in the Bible that has not taken place all right but there's plenty of it taking place we're gonna be able to believe it okay we sees in that way you can see the Pais the present and the future all right now that was my point and we'll try to get into the thought now the John comes to Patmos he's he's brought there you know actually as a prisoner you would call him uh you know throw it out there because of he's trying to teach the Word of God they tried to boil him and all and that didn't work so they decided they just put him out on that's what we would call a good old modern day Alcatraz and make it to where he's out there you know and snakes and things all he is and there's a leave him out there all right but he's out there the Bible says not because he's a prisoner not because of water you doing anything he was out there for the Word of God God had him out time all right now John is there to get sure the future you know he's - right the future that's the purpose John right - east to the church ages a night right the future that's good that's that's wonderful but I love it seeing that's what I've been trying to bring out about no verse one two and three and then coming on down to verse 8 you know because see it's the revelation that God gives to Jesus to give to John now that's not trinitarianism no that's one true and living God all right see it's the bringing of the word to bring it in to view before us and I like the way the Prophet said it he said when he was he said now John he said I want you to know who I am before we continue any further in other words he wanted him to know who was right who was telling him what to rock okay now you win it then see as he was getting that I want you to know who I am see because if you can't get your Bateman you don't know you if you can't see one true and living God in the Bible seething you don't know who you're talking to or about and that's our problem see we need to get it to the basis of a present tense thought of who he is not who he was that's okay not who he's going to be that's okay but the main thing is to see it what he's doing now all right now has he through the opening of the word that we've been able to read have he revealed himself to you now listen to my wording I know I'm strange in the way I speak things but listen to what I'm saying there is no future listen there's no future revelation he said oh yeah I did this Peter no no because when I get there it won't be no revelation it'll be present tense all right you following me it's present tense when God spoke to Moses right but it went backward 3,000 years see back to Genesis and the starting and then it went forward they another three to bring it to the end of the world you know I'm saying it told of that it told of that but it was not future to him he was writing it down right there it was a reality when a man so chariots just as in the streets he was looking two or three thousand years down the way to worry so cars running up and down the highway and had running light light that had torches and things on the face he saw modern-day American highways right but that didn't put him there see he was here in that spot he was only speaking of it to come that's what we won't we something to tell us the future like I was bring it out the other day you know that they tell the story is just a story but it gets the point that a man got a newspaper a day ahead of everybody else on supply it's a story but to get the point every day he got a newspaper a day ahead of everybody well you know what he could bet on horse racism he could bet on anything he wanted to he'd know who's gonna be President above everybody and all that was well and good till one day turned into the you were and ready died the day before now see that's we said well those are silly it may be able to get the point across see I believe in a living reality of God right now a future God don't misunderstand the wording the future God is no no help to anyone a pice tense God is no help other than helping you to understand it happened to somebody else that was done for somebody all right we see something present tense then that's why he would say I am to Moses I am that I am they need say standing there before Abraham was I am uh-huh did he gets over the book of Revelation that's where we hear and the reading it comes down he said I am alright not future tense not Pais tense think of God like that you praying to God of the future are you praying to a god of the past which one is it or is your God real to you and living in you right now present-tense see then if it is you can see the point the Prophet was making when he said John I want you to know who I am wrote one verse one two and three you know but I want you to know who I am and then we'll continue with things to happen or the future or whatever I said I want you to know who I am and he gets that straight comes from verse six seven eight and nine showing the one true in the Living God who this is talking if you got any Scofield Bible dream though you'll see it's red letter showing that Jesus is standing there see it's the revelation that God gives to Jesus to give to John there were something I won't have time to get to it this at this one but they were something that happens he and dark Jesus was standing here and they asked him when he was coming and he said I don't know do you remember that he said I don't know he said the father hadn't revealed that to me what do you say well he was the father he wrote every time right all right let me ask you a question do you have the Holy Ghost in you do you know everything oh you got trout's retired in you see if you understand the Godhead like that you can follow it and keep everything in a present tense form all right see because he's wanting us to see who he is and then when we get that straight what's the next see that's where is the brother was bringing out the other night since we all know it but you know the word I am it means ever-present alright our present tense you know alright and being I am then there's no way to express that thought in the human language really except for one time you just say he's here is that simple enough could you say he's here we're here we're not living yesterday we're not living tomorrow everybody wants to know future they want to know this right why why not this for them where we're at you call on God sometimes when you need him you're in bad shape are you calling him from the future Taniya are from the PI still now according to the Bible you can't go get him and bring him up that Romans and according about you can't go up and get him and bring him down in other words going to the future and bringing it says the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth it's right here present tense all right John net John you're here now right what you see and send it to the seven churches okay and what does he see he heard a voice right and he turns to see the voice now he knew who's talking to it that's what I'm trying to emphasize the other day see he knew who was talking to it he knew that voice he knew who he was to turn around and see he was not looking for it a father or another person or this that or the other John knew who he was to see do you know him that away when he speaks to you do you know him as a reality of now and he says okay now John I want you to wrap these times and send them to the seven churches Johnson okay what do I write and he hears a voice he had lived with that man for three and a half years right he had walked with a man for three and a half he knew his voice he knew who he was looking for when he was to turn but the surprise was to see that the form that he was in it was not a surprise to see the seven churches because he was to write about the ages right but the surprise was to see who you know where it was that what was taking place all right so he turns to see the voice and he saw seven golden cabinets and he saw one in the midst of the seven golden kind of a lock under the son of man now remember see get your and get your thought in the correct order it's the revelation and God gives to Jesus to give the John so here stands Jesus telling John what to write but when he hears that voice behind him he knows something is taking place so he turned to see the voice and when he did he saw seven golden candlesticks the in he sees one standing in the midst of seven gold chemisty like unto the Son of Man now John knew when he was on earth with this man that all of his life that he journeyed with him Jesus was constantly speaking of the Son of man who the man say out of Sodom an immuno son of man is the son of man so deceits on a mandolin listened but none of them ins are saying today was none of them was able to follow him because Peter said when he said who demand say I the Son of Man and Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and what did Jesus say back to him when he was standing there with him on earth he said upon this rock this revelation I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not be able to prevail against it all right but he said Peter I asked you who the Son of Man is you answered me that I'm the Christ the Son of the Living God because that was recognizing him to be Almighty God and it's who was standing there but they never understood that son of man they couldn't follow that so here we see him as he goes to the Book of Revelations to write all right now he said I want you to to understand who I am and he tells who he is he was the Christ the Son of the Living God he was the Almighty he's the I am he's not you know he which was he isn't to come he was Jordan John all of that and then he turns to see the voice and he sees the seven golden Catholics and one in the midst of the seven golden chemistry locking the son of man now he knows something John is a prophet remember he's see something that he was not maybe expecting okay that's why we we used the word in morphe which means God changed in form he was back in the Old Testament as Jehovah alright that's finally come down then he turn to Jesus that was not another person that was God in another form he changed his form he had more feed into another form that's where your oneness they make light of us but see that's where your Trinity is God in three persons you know in all of that other all right but then people say well I'm oneness we'll see oneness if you get down and talk to them a while you'll find out that one this is like your finger see Joe over the oh Jesus Holy Ghost because to the oneness doctrine Jesus was the life form of God now that's the oneness doctrine go check with him you'll see that Jesus was the life form of God well I don't agree with that because you see when it did he showed here where he went on the day of Pentecost he changed his form he am morphine he changed his form to be in the body of Christ see that's where you one that's miss it see they stopped that one with the fingers we call it one there's one see you know and they'll just they won't take that there's another form all right see but that's what's the thing Jesus spoke all the way through all the way through his teaching he was speaking of a future to come right showing that he was going to die for our sins all the whole story of the Gospels alright and as he was going to die for our sins and come back he would come back and live in the bride in other words he changed his phone not changing God's he just changed his phone where he was at that time dwelling in one man the flesh we call it Jesus all right see then under there Pentecost he would come back in a mini membered body called the bride what John is shown that that's what's happened that's what took place in the book of Revelation when he turned to see the voice he knew he was there to write about the future and the different things but when he turned to see the voice it's odd readings he turned to see the voice in other words why didn't he say turn to see the person who's talking no he knew is talking right when he heard that voice saying John rot I am the Alpha all of this and he'd wrote before then he knew who that voice was he knew who was talking to him uh-huh but the key was that he he didn't morph it into another form now he's going to show that that took place on the day of Pentecost now are you listening he's going to show what took place under that Pentecost he's gonna show him seven golden candlesticks which would come out of that as I said Paul takes his part he's a prophet he writes to this church he writes to that church he drives to these churches all right but John Paul is writing present tense oh he prophesized and his speaking but he's writing basically present tense trying to get those people to see go back in the book of Hebrews where Paul was writing and getting that Hebrews and look at it how he was trying to explain who Melchizedek was overlock Chapter four I'm in Chapter seven in there where he says this man melts hesitate see Paul was trying to show God getting God to come and show as a reality and then seeing God come from that to chapter right six and seven and eight he's coming and showing I've come up Paul in Hebrew he's coming and showing where he's at and what's taking place he's right there then living in the hearts of man it's Christ in you Paul said the hope of glory all right then when he comes to Patna see to John he shows him where he's at on the day of Pentecost that Holy Ghost came in to the bride of Jesus Christ right that's why there's not a physical you can't have the physical body of the Lord Jesus here right see that's where people's wrong getting it from all in their hands and blood on this and all of that looks like they would have known that if you've got the physical body here you are way advanced in the scriptures because there's no physical body of the Lord Jesus to be on earth until the Millenium all right so then if that's true and we believe it see thing he has to be in another form so he doesn't come and show john in a seven golden candle see and the son of man standing there well he doesn't showing that way that would be the physical they would mess it all up see that's why I said he don't there's no need of the body being here where his body he's got a body the bride of Jesus causes the body of the Lord no see that's President tense that was my whole Florence around a sentiment that's President tense for God to come and live in you it's present tense it's not future and her pies are you trying to pray backward or forward and ain't no need trying to pray up order downward because the Bible tells you not to do all that it tells you to believe who where he's at and speaking out of the heart proceeded all of them come on all right see then you coming to seeing who he's showing him so he says one lock under the son of man thief he said son of man that would have been that form that would have been that in war fee that phone but he didn't say it he said one lock unto the son of man what he's showing then he showed him the bride who was that that was standing in the seven golden candlesticks pull that up brother never heard about brother Joe pull up the one with the drawing that we enter in a pose too to make it look to what we don't they'll get it in a minute of Jesus Christ standing in the seven golden candlesticks or in Bride form right that's what John looks and sees he sees seven golden candlesticks he sees one in the midst of the seven golden counterfeit like unto us on a man that's not the physical son of man that's the amore fee of God to the form that he went to it Pentecost at Pentecost he went to showing the body the bride would be the body of Jesus Christ all right cuz that's who we are we're flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone those words were the bride all right now so what took place that we read these or we'll go to him in a hurry right around covers the seven churches of message and covers he said one light him who was this his bride one like him who was this his bride one like him she not him in a physical form that's what we're looking for physical things alright this is not the day of the physical even if the rapture took place today according to my Bible and I understand we're supposed to meet him in the air there's no physical coming here of the Lord Jesus Christ he comes we meet him in the air then in the Millenium he comes back and we come back with him into a millennial reign alright so we don't have to worry about the Corporal when the Prophet was saying the bride coming across he said coming out of the church so what happened as we begin to be kicked out of our church tonight walk away you can call that the coming of the Lord because it is because he's in the bride form all right but he said Girt about the paps with a golden girdle did not a man a woman and I said we ain't got the time to go on in to the judge because when he's changing that size and size was changed from down here as a servant it was put up over the shoulder which went on into the to the judge all right well we don't have time to get to that but get what it's all about Girt about the paps not a man a woman with a golden girdle now what happened what is that golden girdle I love this one what is that golden girdle he said well it's a girl just read what he says it's the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ there's your golden girdle s that's a whole thing he's showing where God is at he said John I'm going to show you who I am and he showed him who he was the Alpha Omega the beginning it all and he says now John I want you to see what happened and I called it the other day stage two or whatever you want to call it changing him morphe i want you to see where I am more feed out I am more fit into the body across that's why someone standing in the midst of silicon can lock him to the son of man they said what did what did they see brother branham on why we're not a denomination he said I it was the bride standing in the candlesticks Drott out he saw the bride John what did you see I saw the bride and look going into in his presence we read these other day over and over but says when he seen him standing there that glorified state they actually when John's eyes unveiled unto him as he hears the voice and he knows who he's going to see when he turns around that was no surprise but when he turns and he sees the candlesticks and he sees one in the candlestick like in the son of man then it has to unveil them God has to unveil what he's doing said John I want you to say I am now amor fee on the day of Pentecost God changed his form he came into the body of Christ and it was one lakh unto the Son of Man 1 because the Son of Man is the Lord Jesus Christ but when he changed his form he changed it into showing bride form so he says John this is who I am this is what I've done alright look what he goes on he turned to see the voice and when he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are the same all right so it's no surprise as I said I wish you'd go back and listen to that because it really helped me to understand you know you may not father to me right in doing him to repeat it you know that when Paul on the road to Damascus to kill the Christians as he was riding along then and he was struck down to that great blinding huh he said Lord who art thou now this great man that was on his way to kill the Christians to do all the things he was doing it all of that and when a light strikes him down he knows who that is that's what your prophet said said Paul would have never called nothing else Lord he knew that but what did I going to try to express where we can understand see when when that voice spoke back to Paul when Paul said who Lord who art thou he's recognized him Almighty God Jehovah everything you know he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecutors well see Paul couldn't recognize his natural voice because he never heard that much in his life he never probably never went to even a meeting or anything that Jesus was in but yet he knew what he was doing he knew right then what was speaking to him was greater than to just see a pillar of fire because he knew he was persecuting the Christians he said I'm Jesus whom thou persecuted click that was Paul said now I understand who this Jesus is no wonder he could be the great one of Jehovah the old with Jesus of the new see he could follow him all the way through that's why Paul was chosen for that not any of the rest of them because Paul had all of that background Paul had all of the background of all of that great study training to be there a lawyer or even coming to a high priest or something in his doings you know and under Gamay or the greatest of all the teachers and thought he'd done the best he could do he was a Hebrew of the Hebrews the Pharisee of the Pharisees he said concerning the law blameless what about a man could say something like that God said okay I want to show you because I want to slap you down you think you're something you're a Pharisee of the Pharisees you were their side of the other you're doing it I'm gonna just put you on your knees for a little while said I'm on this the blinds your eyes and everything said you're gonna have to do this and he said then I'm gonna send down someone to open your eyes and says when I get your eyes open then you're gonna find out you're gonna be crawling right because that's what he was there for a long time Paul was blinded and then you know and then when he opened his eyes he even stayed partially blinded right but yet he knew who's talking to it and see John knew his voice he could understand he turned to see eggs expecting Paul might not have understood his voice but he knew that pillar of fire how did he know that pillar of fire you don't think like that how did Paul know that pillar of fire because he was always around there he was always his whole life was related to serving God he'd been in the temple he'd been all over the floor he'd eaten worse he done he was great guy but he said when I was and he said to him on Jesus all said that solves that he said I don't understand it he said the best thing for me to do I didn't get this on my own I got knocked down off my house the best thing for me to do is get back up on the house and ride somewhere he's because they ain't nobody can explain this and they wasn't even the great apostles couldn't explain to Paul sure that for a little bit they were with him he was right if you read your scripture he was out just a little bit with us some of the Apostles maybe but then all at once he just goes off he leaves and he stays gone one writer says three and a half years one of them says 14 either one of them is a long time but then when he comes back he's preaching the same Lord Jesus that Peter was he knew all right now he'd got the voice the person together and everything that's what I'm trying to get have you ever heard his voice now quote the Prophet he said have you heard in the sealed book let's see he said have you heard his voice oh brother tell the brother Browns only ones of that could speak you can argue all you won't think and arguing about it I want to tell you God can speak and if you doubt he can speak to you you know ha he he'll speak to you it's okay but if you believe in some way somewhere he can there's a possibility can maybe you can speak to you by the opening of the word all right now listen John you're here you know now Who I am now you know what I've done I've changed forms of amore feed on the debt Pentecost when you receive that Holy Ghost this is what you got the new bark John you got eternal life and now I've got you here to tell you the future of the church because that was John's purpose that was the reason he was going to Patmos so he's writes him he said okay I'm this on that I love coming down and then he said okay now John do you understand I've changed formed I am more feed I'm not on earth anymore I'm not in this I'm not in that I'm in the bride so I've changed my form and I want you to see what form I'm in seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of man God in another form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the bride of Jesus Christ what a wonderful picture John is shown then he goes through and tells him the church ages now listen this is the point I tried to make about ten years ago when I was preaching on this you realize that God was setting up John to a place you realize that if you'll take the first verse 1 through about 13 or 14 you'll see this point John wanted the church to realize who God was because he was living in him Jesus wanted the church to see who he was because he was the one there to live in each one of us all right before he writes the church ages now here's the point I've been aiming at is for 5 4 sermons as 5 huh John I'm gonna tell you what to write to the ages I'm gonna tell you there's gonna be some bad I'm going on also you remember the church age you he's writing to the true and falsifying both right you remember that he's writing to both vines to the church age you he said John are not only want you to know all about the test but I want you to understand John I want you to think about I'm gonna show you the future did he tell him the future come on did he bring him all the way through the church edges did he bring him into revelations for rapture did he bring him in Revelation 5 love in heaven 6 back with the Jews run 6 through 19 with the Jews really 4 through not three with the Jews and then comes back with Jew and Gentile are the Jews and the bride in chapter 19 riding back into the Millenium we get one come by before I tell you any of these things to write down about the ages I want you to know when I get in there and say that you got some deeds and doctrines now listen to the point I'll quit a little bit what was what was the reason of Jesus appearing to John to write these things before he started writing the ages why didn't he just write him right to hate you you know cuz that's what he was there for but he said I want you to know who I am till we get to God head straight we got all that in line and he said I want you to know where I went on the day of Pentecost into the bride I changed my form and come into the bride and he said I'm so much tied up in the bride his hair was white like wool etcetera etcetera and then John comes down and John sees this one in the midst of the seven golden candle and listen do you believe that was the bride well listen to the point when John sees that in the sense of glorified condition he falls down to worship read your Bible come on Ritchie Papa he falls down to worship in the end in his right hand who this one at the start and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword all of those things okay and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead any ladies right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the life that's the Lord Jesus Christ that is not a prophet that is not anything that's the Lord Jesus Christ now he unveils that showing one like unto the Son of Man would be the bride but then when he comes back toward the view watch him he's coming by to reveal I am all of this in other words John I'm gonna right now we're gonna rock the church edges now won't you write it down don't you write these good and don't you write these bad things but said remember before we start I didn't showed you where I am are you listening so there's God to see the church ages does he see our wrong and he's already told John how perfect we are come on you didn't listen to where I straighten the Court where the Prophet said seeing him standing there in her in that glorified condition before we start in chapter 2 of the ages he already showed how perfect the bride is then it goes back into time yeah and we do and we have problems we have troubles and we're lady offends no no no we're not let no we got to be to birthed out of that the kamon before he ever starts telling anything of the future of the church he tells how perfect the church is you don't listen you ain't listen to what wade talking about the fields you and how perfect that shows that grace comes on the scene through those fields you grace comes on the scene who do you think this is standing here he's telling you where he went John I'm telling you where I'm going I'm going in or went because this is after pineco he said I went into the bride John I want you to see the form of in in Brad form one in the midst of selling gold Kennison lack under the son of man are you listening now what about him riding the end of the book before he starts the book are you listening like I told you my brother he said how could Moses cuz see they don't believe Moses wrote the first five books they think he might wrote four of them or whatever it is you know Methodists they got all that but he said he said Sam he said you can't be right no way about Moses writing him thing I said what he said called you wrote of his own death I said well what's that problem how did he write of his own death before he died you know what I said you've heard already what I said to him and I'm talking to a 12-year theologian I said look if you'll tell me how Moses knew what happened in Genesis and the creation and the things that took place and the fall of mankind I said then you ain't got no problems trying to figure out how he could write of his death before he died you remember how is illustrating the turn today fellas listen to the tape about see I could say you know what if town life fifty more years I'm gonna die you know what I'd be doing I'd be prophesying right I'd be telling the truth go down 78 years old I don't think I'd make fifty more years well it's easy to write of your own death Paul is I mean Moses could write or what happened and what happened he brought it all the way through to his own death and then it kept on going because it was the spirit of prophecy most okay I won't say it Moses was not the guy that wrote the five books now Yuri listening don't jump too far Rutter he physically pinned or somebody did let me talk somebody else all right come on anger arguing Moe's has done that but the one that was leading him the Prophet the Prophet wrote the Prophet was one that was speaking through Moses now come on we're gonna get around a little bit in it you want to you remember what the Prophet said about Moses he said I couldn't understand about Moses being able to tell God a better way to do something you remember when he come up was gonna kill him and Moses said if you kill him you're gonna kill me God turns around and don't kill him oh yeah he got him later yeah cuz he said so don't worry about it Moses he said I'm gonna bypass it now I'm gonna pass over you leave it because you're doing that but he said I'll deal with him but what to probably say about Moses he said I couldn't see how Moses could tell God I better wait till I've seen it was Christ in Moses there's the Prophet the Prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ little Brandon was not the prophet he was a prophet the Prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ all right here is the Prophet himself appearing to John on Patmos and telling him what's taking place any back so said okay now we'll sit down here we'll write down what we're going right we said I want you to know forever start writing I want you to know for start writing I want you to know what I'm gonna do before I start writing for start telling you the good and the bad so I won't tell you what you who you are you think he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks do you think that bride is going to be wiped off the earth for some reason or wrong or something and he shows where he's at you understand what I'm getting at he shows right where he went he went right into the Bride of Christ on the death penticoff who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect when God has already wrote the future about it the commodious wrote the book to two lady ousia up to the what in the third Church age I mean third chapter he's already wrote chapter 4 showing 24 elders sometime he's already wrote that's what he's doing here John write these things do you follow me he's already told you how perfect you are all you gotta do is accept back come on did the Prophet say this he said you can accept him all you want to was said but he's got to accept you but do you realize what I'm saying if he's already wrote the back of the book he's done told how he accepts you the book of Revelation doesn't show some outlandish brighter or four it shows how perfect that bride really is come on what about it taking a reduced feeling animal quit okay if they won't pick up number uh pick up number five if you want to we'll start on number five which is revelation of Jesus Christ all right no it is not the story of John but is the revelation of Jesus Christ in the future church ages he's riding of what's going to take place in the future Church ages in verse three it's called a prophecy and that's exactly what it is go ahead number the revelation of Jesus Christ look what he says rayona the letters to the seven churches were written prophetically ever how you pronounce that word to the future ages now here's the one I told you was in our life Paul wrote of the life and glory of the seven church churches present in his day now not seven Church agency hero to the churches in his day some of them were the age some of them were names that went on over but that that's not it Paul wrote of the glory of the seven churches present in his day John wrote of the life and glory of the seven church churches in the future that John was addressing the seven pastors or messengers of the ages see Paul wrote of what's taking place John wrote of the future okay come on let's go over the next one page thirteen church age book this book is usually termed a revelation of st. John but that is incorrect it's the revelation of Jesus Christ given to John for Christians of all ages it is the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus himself through personally appearing to a scribe come on he's dying today it is the last book of the Bible yet it tells the beginning and the ending and all things drop all down cuz we're gonna pick up one more flower now the unveil I'm covering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ now listen you'll get the whole message from this but it is the revelation of his future works in the oncoming 7 church ages now he's going to write the future but glory listen he told you the present he told you his pies to where he come from he told you the present and how perfect you are then he's gonna tell what's gonna take place he's just gonna ride it out in other words listen the fees in church age there's the first chapter of Revelations which is the only book in the Bible in the New Testament the whole Canon of the New Testament is the only book in other words the book of Revelation is the only book that Jesus puts his own sea alone he comes to John on Patmos to write the book right come on let's get this one morning real quick revelations Jesus Christ and this book is not the uncovering of so much the person of Jesus Christ yet it certainly speaks of his deity and his Sevenfold personal eats and also of the things that he is like priest-king and so forth but it is the revealing of the future of his works in his 7 church ages that's coming on i read that but is the revealing of the future of his works in his seven church ages are coming master so they asked him see when the Lord was here on earth disciple asked him said master will you at this time restore the kingdom back to Israel member book of Acts and Jesus said it's not for you to know this hour or time and no one would know said even the Sun as yet now listen even the Sun as yet do you not know you remember the story while ago don't get flopped up own it and mess up you mind remember I asked you the question you say well why wouldn't he's a father why didn't he know you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost why don't you know everything because you haven't had it revealed to you are made manifest Jesus was a human element and that human element did not know everything now watch it though because when this takes place this human element of Jesus has already went to the crucifixion he's already went to the transformation he's already went to the resurrection he's already went through these things right this man named Jesus no what's it no one knows that even the son is yet did not know but after his death burial and resurrection and ascension into glory okay come on he received from God the future of the church in other words he got the revelation of what he's going to do what he was going to do and where he was going he was going into the church he was going to be there he was going to be through the ages know what then he returned back to bring his message to the church and this message of his coming and the condition of his churches down through the age he could not do it before his death Brookland resurrection because he had not yet knew it but did you notice how the scripture brings it okay the unveiling come on musicians the unveiling listen Church there's a lot more to this than to just talk about Church ages I hope you're listening cause remember this one in the sense of the seven golden candlesticks was the Lord Jesus Christ in bride form now he's revealing where he's at he's revealing to you and I this day this day the Scriptures fulfil if it's made known to you who you are and what you're doing come on we know the world is in lady Elsie well you know what that means that means six church ages are done pies huh let's see we're standing here in the seventh church age lady of SIA giving the revelation of not what is to happen because that's that's not our point I don't care about what tomorrow is going to be I try to live every day day by day I try to walk day by day in the Lord because tomorrow tomorrow's wonderful but remember tomorrow is a future I want to live with the I am I want to stay where exactly we don't think he's into Martin no not if he's right now if he said it I ain't gonna argue with him about it are you he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you now I like it - it said it didn't say always come on read your Bible he said I'll be with you alway they know ass on the end of it because alway means simply if you look it up and find what he's talking about there he said I'm going to be with you when I need to be with you as well I thought he was with me all the time he is you just don't know it you just don't know it he wants you to know when he's with you because he's never going to leave you right come on listen he showed the church perfect before he ever start telling the ages is that the summation or our thought or idea of the entire Bible you realize that in genesis before he got down to doing anything he'd already put the seed of the woman which was Jesus Christ right how can he condemned anything when man sinned in the garden now listen you realize how perfect Moses could drive when man sinned in the garden do you realize God Himself came down and killed him animals itself and made skins oh no no yeah well now you tell me who else did then we will wind on argue about it we just gonna make facts the animals got killed and if he was the only one there he must have been the one that killed him oh I don't believe God can kill that's not I like what rabbi Richmond said about offering a sacrifice he said when that sacrifice is offering he said it simply means God is right there every one of them offerings of them lamb since I meant God was standing right there but we don't see it that way we see him all will be under overtire that's our problem let's get him here if we get him here then he can reveal his word like on these things less than what we got past anybody got a need with [Music] pass me not your slave baby Oh anybody gonna need my pride Wow others out [Music] Oh [Music] the past me [Music] and we're singing say [Music] come Oh cry [Music] others dude pass me by bleh the throat of a Percy sweet new there indeed country fishin yes Lord my Oh and we're singing [Music] you need a reality of living that filtering [Music] pass me ma and these children about it if you can get them to believe it's real [Applause] [Music] I died face yes [Music] my woody [Music] Saturday night see with their diamond a the minute father we commit it to you today in the service and we've tried our best none the best we could do the order to try to deliver your word because we're not talking about something to come we're not talking about something that has been we're talking about what's here now reality of believe in you and accepting you we love in we thank you me with everybody now and go into natural meal bring it back together Lord this afternoon to hear wait is he ministers the word of course we love in with Lincoln Jesus you dismiss and was again [Music] [Applause] my [Music]
