[1:54] Romans 8 Genesis 4. we just received a
[1:57] notice from Brother Bob that they did do
[2:02] the the
[2:03] drainage from the fluid in the lungs of
[2:06] sister Monica's mother and it did
[2:08] positive test positive for cancer

[2:21] was a
[2:22] a bad cold or whatever it is it's all in
[2:25] God

[3:06] you're supposed to be in the part of
[3:09] that week so remember that and just pray
[3:11] that the Lord would bless each one all
[3:13] right Romans 8.
[3:16] and Genesis 4. Heavenly Father we thank
[3:20] you for your grace and your love unto us
[3:22] and thank you for all things
[3:24] and we know you give them to us freely
[3:26] so then we don't have to work for them
[3:27] we don't have to pay for them we don't
[3:29] have to do nothing for him we just have
[3:31] to believe
[3:32] so Just Have Your Way forgive our sins
[3:35] and lead us by thy Grace and
[3:36] understanding father and we pray that
[3:39] you'd be there with sister Monica's
[3:41] mother
[3:42] Lord and just deliver her because we
[3:45] believe you we believe that by your
[3:47] stripes he's healed just as much as it
[3:48] would be if they told us he had a bad
[3:50] cold Lord
[3:51] or any kind of infection there's no
[3:54] difference because we believe you we
[3:56] just ask you to be with us tonight Lord
[3:58] and touch his old body in this cold and
[4:00] everything Satan's trying to give us and
[4:02] we try to give it back to him and we
[4:04] just but we just Praise Your Great Name
[4:07] for your loving grace unto each one of
[4:08] us have your way in our hearts and lives
[4:11] forgive our sins and lead us in Jesus
[4:14] name
[4:15] amen
[4:16] you know this is I mean Romans 8.
[4:20] I may have to be huffing and puffing but
[4:22] if I put in a cough drop tonight it
[4:24] won't be because that I'm chugged up
[4:27] and so uh bad cold is trying to get on
[4:30] us and it just starts running and been
[4:33] life and sitting down on the deer stand
[4:35] you know and trying to hunt yesterday
[4:37] afternoon and this morning and sitting
[4:40] there coughing and a wheezing and a
[4:41] grunting and doing everything else I
[4:44] finally just put my face mask this stuff
[4:46] under my nose and you know
[4:48] kind of bad way of doing it but because
[4:51] I couldn't just keep wiping and doing it
[4:52] I just put it under there and just went
[4:54] over and just let it drop and then it
[4:57] made no difference
[4:58] you know do everything you can to try to
[5:01] hunt and don't see nothing anyway but
[5:03] maybe you don't see nothing cause you're
[5:04] blowing your nose so much I guess but
[5:06] just uh just keep us in your prayers
[5:08] it'll be all right all right Romans 8 28
[5:11] and we know that all things work
[5:13] together for good to them that love God
[5:15] to them who are thee called according to
[5:17] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[5:20] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[5:23] the image of his son that he might be
[5:25] the firstborn among many brethren
[5:27] moreover I want to get to that one these
[5:29] days that he's the firstborn among many
[5:32] Brethren more over whom he did
[5:35] predestinate than he also called and
[5:37] whom he called them he also justified in
[5:39] whom he justified them he also already
[5:42] passed Tennessee
[5:44] glorified what shall we then say to
[5:46] these things if God be for us who can be
[5:49] against us
[5:50] it's a great thing right all right go to
[5:53] Genesis
[5:55] 4.
[5:58] and we'll read a little bit
[6:02] 4-1 and Adam knew his wife and she
[6:05] conceived and bear Cain and said I've
[6:08] gotten a man from the Lord
[6:10] and again and she again bear his brother
[6:12] Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep
[6:15] but Cain was a tiller of the ground and
[6:17] in the process of time it came to pass
[6:19] that Cain brought to the fruit of the
[6:21] ground and offering unto the Lord
[6:23] enabled he also brought her the
[6:24] firstlings of his flock off the fat
[6:27] thereof and the Lord had to respect unto
[6:29] Abel and to his offering but unto Cain
[6:32] in his offering he had not respect and
[6:34] Cain was very wrath and his countenance
[6:36] fell
[6:37] and the Lord said unto Cain why aren't
[6:40] thy Roth and why is thy canonists Fallen
[6:43] if I do as well shall thou not be
[6:47] accepted and if thou doest not well sin
[6:49] life at the door and unto thee shall be
[6:51] his desire and thou shalt rule over him
[6:54] see we can rule over sin if if we were
[6:56] desire correct and Cain taught with Abel
[6:59] his brother and it came to pass
[7:02] when they were in the field at Cain rose
[7:04] up against Abel his brother and slew him
[7:07] and the Lord said unto Cain where is thy
[7:10] brother
[7:11] and he said I know not
[7:13] am I My Brother's Keeper and he said
[7:16] what has thou done the voice of thy
[7:18] brother's blood clieth unto me from the
[7:19] ground
[7:20] and thou art thou curse from the Earth
[7:23] which hath opened her mouth to receive
[7:26] thy brother's blood from thy hand when
[7:29] thou tillest the ground now remember
[7:31] Adam had already been placed on for him
[7:34] but here it really gets bad for this he
[7:37] would not tell us the ground that shall
[7:39] not henceforth yield any
[7:41] yield unto thee her strength a fugitive
[7:44] and a vagabond shall thou be in the
[7:45] Earth
[7:47] and Cain said unto the Lord my
[7:48] punishment is greater than I can bear
[7:51] Behold thy has driven me out this day
[7:53] from from the face of the Earth and from
[7:55] thy faith shall I be hid
[7:57] that shall be a fugitive in a vagabond
[7:59] in the earth and it shall come to pass
[8:01] that everyone that findeth me shall slay
[8:04] me and the Lord said unto him therefore
[8:07] whosoever slayeth came Vengeance shall
[8:10] be taken upon Him Sevenfold and the Lord
[8:13] set a mark upon Cain lest any finding
[8:17] him should kill him you may be seated
[8:20] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[8:23] of the word
[8:24] now
[8:25] I want to go back over a lot of things
[8:29] that we covered there Sunday
[8:32] but you know not to try to do too much
[8:34] but try to uh
[8:38] because what I want to tie together
[8:41] is
[8:43] of what we've been talking about first
[8:45] you have unbelief
[8:47] all right
[8:49] see then unbelief has a display
[8:53] or we call it an attribute like drinking
[8:56] gambling smoke is not sin it's an
[8:58] attribute see it's a display and in
[9:01] doing that if you'll notice each one of
[9:04] these things in Cain what I want you to
[9:06] think about
[9:07] is
[9:09] first Cain gets upset because of his
[9:13] offering well evidently he was in
[9:16] unbelief about his offering
[9:18] all right
[9:20] he gets upset and he's goes before God
[9:23] and his brother random said where was
[9:24] ever a time when anybody ever you know
[9:27] just literally
[9:29] lambasted God or this you know rebuke
[9:32] right at him you know I don't know
[9:35] am I My Brother's Keeper and uh
[9:39] then
[9:41] see there was a display
[9:44] of
[9:45] Cain's unbelief
[9:48] and that wound up being
[9:51] killing his brother
[9:53] so there's always a display
[9:55] of anything so we say the original sin
[9:58] was unbelief and that's true all right
[10:02] but it had a display or an attribute in
[10:06] the act with Eve between Eve and the
[10:09] Beast
[10:10] and to mess up the whole human race see
[10:13] it's always an attribute follows
[10:16] unbelief
[10:18] all right now the point I want you to
[10:21] get this afternoon if we can
[10:24] is
[10:26] we know the Bible doesn't say about Cain
[10:29] or saying leave it take it or leave it
[10:31] brother random is the one who emphasizes
[10:34] that's what he's saying
[10:36] all right now
[10:38] once you say
[10:41] take it or leave it
[10:44] once you bring it out as I was trying to
[10:46] say there Sunday you know when you say
[10:48] take it or leave it
[10:50] all right then there's going to be a
[10:54] display
[10:56] of that
[10:58] there's going to be an attribute of that
[11:00] there's going to be something
[11:02] brought out
[11:03] that will uh
[11:05] you know go into greater things and then
[11:09] from that
[11:10] that you see
[11:12] then that in itself once it comes into
[11:15] being
[11:19] then it will become greater or get worse
[11:23] and worse and worse and worse as it goes
[11:26] along now had Cain
[11:30] done what God told him to do
[11:33] we've done proved it by Brother Branham
[11:35] and we don't worry about it then but
[11:36] we've already covered it that
[11:40] God offered Cain
[11:43] you know he would have been all right if
[11:46] he'd done it and you you got to remember
[11:48] brother Donnie and I talking a lot about
[11:50] this yesterday and today but remember
[11:55] to illustrate it like in the children of
[11:57] Israel
[11:59] it says that Israel sin ten times
[12:02] from the time they left Egypt until they
[12:05] got to Katie sparnia
[12:06] all right that literally says they send
[12:09] sin ten times now sure there was a lot
[12:11] of people got killed 30 000 like at some
[12:13] at one time or something you know all
[12:15] right but still they were on the way to
[12:18] the promised land
[12:21] right
[12:22] all right then when it did the
[12:26] the unbelief that had been in the people
[12:30] manifested itself in a greater way
[12:33] when it come to kadish barnia
[12:37] and when it did it really showed that
[12:39] unbelief as a great thing because
[12:42] like I've tried to show you then God
[12:44] would forgive him for doing this he'd
[12:46] forgive them for doing that he'd forgive
[12:47] them and doing this ten times he said go
[12:49] on you're going to the promised land
[12:51] but when it come to the point that they
[12:56] disbelieve God about the bases that they
[13:00] were capable of going into the land you
[13:03] remember the ten spies
[13:05] well like God said all right
[13:08] that's all the unbelief I'm gonna put up
[13:10] with
[13:11] it's got worse and worse and worse and
[13:13] worse now you've come to the worst of
[13:15] all that you're doubting me that I'm
[13:18] capable of doing it's okay you're
[13:20] heading to the Wilderness you know in a
[13:23] display all right see that's what I look
[13:26] at in the garden as it starts off with
[13:28] one thing
[13:31] you know then it went to another thing
[13:35] and another thing see
[13:37] and Eve you can see that it was her
[13:38] unbelief
[13:40] all right
[13:41] then it went from her unbelief to a
[13:44] physical act
[13:46] the of adultery
[13:48] and uh
[13:50] then we see that same thing start in
[13:53] Cain
[13:55] and Cain's unbelief
[13:58] evidently must have been believing
[13:59] Mama's lie uh you know
[14:03] because looked like
[14:04] that surely him being the firstborn that
[14:08] uh you know
[14:10] look like Adam and Eve would have taught
[14:11] their kids what went on but they
[14:13] evidently didn't I'm just that's just a
[14:16] point
[14:17] and as it wound up so
[14:20] Cain winds up in saying
[14:24] all right
[14:27] I've done what I've done
[14:31] I
[14:32] not going to do anything else
[14:36] that you can take it or leave it
[14:39] all right
[14:40] now
[14:41] we know God left it
[14:45] so now watch what I'm getting at we're
[14:47] going to go if we have time from take it
[14:49] or leave it
[14:52] to the mark of the beast
[14:56] going to run around and said that was
[14:57] the first time in the garden the mark of
[15:00] the beast was placed upon mankind it's
[15:02] placed on Cain brother Carly and I were
[15:05] in a meeting up in South Carolina when a
[15:07] couple of the big name preachers with
[15:10] our conducting of questions and answer
[15:12] con you know thing and
[15:15] somebody asked him said what was the
[15:17] mark that was put on Cain well they knew
[15:19] better than to go into Blackness Etc
[15:22] so they said well we don't know when we
[15:25] was coming back down the road
[15:27] and I said well brother Carly you know
[15:28] something we were talking about it I
[15:30] said you know they didn't know and I
[15:32] said I really don't know
[15:34] what was the mark that was put on Cain
[15:36] he said I do
[15:39] I said you do he said yeah I just heard
[15:42] brother Branham
[15:44] say it was the mark of the beast I said
[15:47] well okay
[15:48] maybe we need to turn around and go back
[15:50] and let you answer some questions you
[15:53] know
[15:55] but the point is watching something
[15:57] it'll go from one thing
[15:59] and it'll go to another
[16:02] all right
[16:03] had came
[16:06] have done
[16:08] what Abel done God would have accepted
[16:11] it
[16:12] all right now I believe that
[16:14] and he still didn't stop dealing with
[16:17] him
[16:18] we gave you a quote in that maybe
[16:20] re-quote it after a while
[16:23] but everyone said God went after him
[16:27] he still wouldn't even after all that
[16:29] that happened
[16:31] and even after he killed his brother
[16:38] you notice
[16:40] the Lord's still talking to Cain
[16:45] he said no that couldn't be forgiven
[16:50] it's all right do what you want to
[16:52] I'm just stating what the scripture says
[16:55] God was still talking to Cain
[16:57] all right
[17:00] but when Cain is we'll get to it now I
[17:03] know brother random I've looked it up I
[17:05] know his way he's saying it
[17:07] and he's saying that God drove Cain out
[17:10] I agree with that
[17:13] but the Bible says it Cain
[17:15] went out
[17:17] from the presence of the Lord
[17:19] he doesn't say God run him off
[17:22] right
[17:24] now he was put out because sure you
[17:27] couldn't leave sin in that presence but
[17:30] just remember that after all was said
[17:32] and done
[17:35] God was still dealing with Cain
[17:41] all right
[17:42] but then when it finished up
[17:45] the Cain went out of the presence of the
[17:47] Lord you never find again
[17:49] in the Bible I'd like to see it you
[17:52] don't find
[17:55] God dealing with Cain anymore
[17:58] see he'd sealed his Doom
[18:00] all right
[18:02] so then let's be careful that we don't
[18:05] do that
[18:07] all right
[18:09] you say well brother Dale I don't think
[18:10] we will well
[18:14] I'm just honest to ask you a serious
[18:17] question
[18:18] how many of you thought about
[18:21] the point of Cain's saying take it or
[18:25] leave it
[18:27] until we read what the prophet had to
[18:29] say about it
[18:31] right and found out it to be very
[18:33] serious
[18:35] and very related to the very hour that
[18:38] you and I are living
[18:40] but we can look back dark and talk about
[18:42] that
[18:43] but what has that got to do with me and
[18:45] you
[18:47] all right now that's the point I was
[18:50] driving at
[18:52] because I had it on my notes and we only
[18:53] got just a little bit Sunday
[18:57] is to saying take it or leave it
[19:02] the next step is the mark of the beast
[19:07] now
[19:10] to read what a prophet has to say
[19:13] should be enough for you and I
[19:16] to check our own selves
[19:18] that's what brother Dale I don't have
[19:20] the mark of the beast I don't I've never
[19:22] told God take it or leave it well
[19:24] there's no place in the Bible that Cain
[19:25] says God take it or leave it
[19:30] no
[19:31] that was the point I was trying to get
[19:33] at
[19:36] the Bible says that we go in the way of
[19:38] Cain
[19:41] what was the way of Cain
[19:45] very religious
[19:48] going to church
[19:52] worshiping God
[19:59] believing God
[20:01] we read what the prophet said about it
[20:05] could we be in that class
[20:09] because remember
[20:16] you and I either have
[20:19] the mark of the beast
[20:22] or the Seal of God
[20:24] and we're not talking about children in
[20:26] underage and different I know get it out
[20:29] of your mind forget all that
[20:30] we're talking about people
[20:34] that we either have the mark of the
[20:35] beast or we have the Seal of God
[20:40] and I'd like for you to think about that
[20:42] a little bit
[20:44] why would it say mark of the beast
[20:50] with seal of God
[20:56] now remember
[20:58] as we'll get to it and we'll back up
[21:00] when I make this statement
[21:03] the mark of the beast is in your
[21:05] forehead
[21:08] is that right
[21:10] the Seal of God
[21:15] is in your forehead
[21:19] no brother Dale seal of God's in my
[21:21] heart
[21:23] we'll get to that
[21:26] I know where it's at
[21:28] I know it's in your heart
[21:31] but what does the Bible talk about
[21:33] the Seal of God being in your forehead
[21:38] it does
[21:41] but I want you to think about it and
[21:42] just stay with me
[21:44] from leave it there
[21:51] we'll go to the mark of the beast if we
[21:53] don't do something about it
[21:59] and I thought well surely Lord I don't
[22:01] need to get away from this
[22:03] I don't mind reading the same thing over
[22:05] again
[22:08] for us to look at it
[22:12] we went through about
[22:14] Cain being of the wicked one
[22:18] and the wicked one being the children of
[22:21] the
[22:23] you know
[22:24] you got the seed of God coming through
[22:26] the children of God
[22:28] in the parable and then you've got the
[22:29] wicked one being the children of the
[22:30] devil
[22:32] all right
[22:34] but then why would Jude as I was trying
[22:37] to express our Sunday
[22:40] first is Jude 1 11.
[22:44] why would it put
[22:46] in the way of Cain
[22:49] right in the line with the era of Balaam
[22:58] put a wave Cain right into Arab Balaam
[23:05] and knowing that Balaam was
[23:07] the one who got God to curse Israel
[23:12] it's close folks
[23:15] he said but I would have the baptism of
[23:16] the Holy Ghost
[23:23] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[23:24] Ghost on your spirit every day of your
[23:25] life and don't go to hell
[23:27] do you have the Seal of God
[23:32] yeah but the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:34] right
[23:36] it is the Seal of God
[23:38] there's a lot goes with it
[23:41] they get a chance for don't I'll take it
[23:43] up next service and never think it
[23:44] didn't bother me to just because I want
[23:47] to just keep laying it before you
[23:49] to give you a chance to think it over
[23:52] because the way of Cain
[23:56] was not to start with
[23:59] a murderous
[24:01] mean character
[24:05] that was the display finally
[24:08] of his unbelief
[24:12] he went to church
[24:14] he served God
[24:18] and remember now that when you come over
[24:20] to this that they've done been put out
[24:22] of the garden the third chapter
[24:26] and Cain is right there before
[24:30] the cherubims are turning to guard the
[24:32] way of the Tree of Life
[24:34] Cain and Abel both offer their offering
[24:37] at the gate
[24:39] that goes in that's what your Prophet
[24:41] said all right we're to know that by
[24:43] reading all right
[24:46] but now
[24:49] let's just be careful that we don't let
[24:51] this
[24:52] form of Cain
[24:55] being us of leave it there
[25:01] because the next is the mark of the
[25:03] beast
[25:05] all right
[25:07] so the prophet said
[25:09] you already have the mark of the beast
[25:13] are you how the Seal of God
[25:17] all right so that means
[25:20] every person in the world
[25:26] no matter whether they're
[25:28] knowing about salvations
[25:30] Etc whatever you know christianities
[25:36] they're sealed by the
[25:40] Away by the mark of the beast
[25:43] right
[25:45] now brother random I read it to our
[25:48] Sunday but did you pay close attention
[25:50] he said 99
[25:54] out of a hundred
[26:01] goes like Kane
[26:07] and there's not a hundred in here but
[26:09] we'll say there's 50 in here
[26:12] so that would only leave a half of a
[26:15] high for sure
[26:17] right you get me
[26:20] if there was a hundred in here it'd mean
[26:23] one had the Seal of God the rest had to
[26:26] mark of the beast star
[26:29] and I don't think that way but I'm just
[26:32] I don't think he was thinking that away
[26:34] but he's the one that gave the example
[26:37] all right so then if we're going to
[26:39] believe what he says we ought to believe
[26:40] it
[26:41] but I want to reread all of these
[26:45] you know
[26:47] I want us to make sure that we're not in
[26:48] the way of Cain
[26:54] um
[26:55] because remember now
[26:59] Jude puts the way of Cain right in with
[27:01] the error of Balaam and what's the other
[27:03] one
[27:05] and gain saying okorah
[27:07] and Cora was the one you know that says
[27:09] we're we're all spiritual
[27:14] I got it right think what I won't think
[27:15] cause I'm spiritual too
[27:21] putting it all together
[27:24] but think about it
[27:27] could we be that away
[27:31] and if we are that away
[27:34] would we be in this day especially would
[27:37] be would we be of a murderous character
[27:43] you know
[27:47] because you've done transformed over
[27:49] into the Christian Realm
[27:53] and and that wouldn't be allowed so you
[27:56] wouldn't be dealing with murderers and
[27:58] killings and things
[28:02] but it would come down to just simple
[28:04] little things in our lives
[28:08] then what about it
[28:11] but brother Dale you you know that's why
[28:14] we don't you know
[28:16] you don't give us hopes
[28:20] there is no hope outside of Jesus Christ
[28:26] I'm telling brother Donnie today I said
[28:27] well there's one thing that I feel about
[28:30] I said my
[28:32] I'm not guilty the blood of no man
[28:36] I can honestly say that because I
[28:38] believe I've tried
[28:41] to do what was right
[28:43] you know
[28:45] all right and I'm free of that because
[28:47] I've tried to tell you the truth
[28:50] all right
[28:52] but let's just read these things and
[28:54] think about
[28:56] what your Prophet is saying of the way
[28:58] of Cain
[29:03] and see if we're in that way
[29:06] just remember now
[29:08] there's none of these quotes that we
[29:10] give
[29:12] goes back to a murderous
[29:15] character
[29:17] you know
[29:19] it all goes to a very religious
[29:23] oh
[29:25] things that he's talking about going to
[29:28] church being good serving God believing
[29:31] God
[29:38] think about it
[29:40] go ahead brother and let's start on
[29:42] number one which is Abraham's Covenant
[29:44] confirmed
[29:46] uh
[29:47] 61 318.
[29:51] so many people today God
[29:54] you'll give your intellects to God
[29:57] he will do that
[30:00] I'll build you a big house
[30:02] I'll make you an organization I'll do
[30:04] this I'll do that don't you realize
[30:06] that's the same thing Cain did
[30:09] it was rejected he said
[30:12] all right
[30:14] Cain built himself an altar and made a
[30:16] sacrifice and said here it is I worship
[30:18] you
[30:19] I believe you
[30:22] there's My Sacrifice he worships
[30:26] like brother Donnie brought up a good
[30:27] point he said you think Cain went away
[30:29] and went off and quit making offerings I
[30:31] said no I don't think he did
[30:33] I think he went away from the garden and
[30:35] probably went right on making offerings
[30:39] but I don't believe he made him in blood
[30:40] do you
[30:42] right no
[30:45] so what did he say Cain built himself an
[30:47] altar and made a sacrifice and said here
[30:49] it is I worship you I believe you
[30:51] there's My Sacrifice there's my altar
[30:53] take it or leave it
[30:57] well look
[30:59] as I said you don't find that in the
[31:02] scriptures
[31:04] but a prophet gives us the understanding
[31:08] of what the scriptures are saying
[31:11] right
[31:12] thing so he gives you the understanding
[31:15] of what Cain was doing
[31:18] see Kane didn't just jump up and run out
[31:20] of the garden when these things started
[31:21] happening
[31:24] it went on for a while until it come
[31:26] into murder
[31:29] we'll get to that if we have time
[31:32] he said that's the man today
[31:34] the religious man
[31:36] Esau the same way
[31:38] and the church the same way I've done
[31:40] this I've done this I've done this
[31:43] it ain't what you've done is what he
[31:45] done give him your heart and follow him
[31:49] next one e-18 mark of the beast 1961-17.
[31:57] and we noticed that Cain he made an
[31:58] altar he put sacrifice on it
[32:01] he got down and confessed his faith in
[32:03] God
[32:08] and he worshiped God
[32:11] see we think about him as just a
[32:13] murderer
[32:16] that was a manifestation
[32:20] of his unbelief
[32:22] you know all right
[32:24] he worshiped God in other words just
[32:27] like the religious man today 99
[32:30] out of a hundred almost they say
[32:34] and there's his quotes he
[32:36] here it is
[32:39] so 99 out of 100 says here it is
[32:45] it's the best that I can do
[32:49] Cain said this is I I built an altar
[32:53] I belong here to church I made a
[32:55] sacrifice
[32:56] this is the best I can do take it or
[32:59] leave it there it is that's just that's
[33:02] the attitude of people today I go to
[33:05] church I help them do everything we
[33:08] build a nice building built a nice
[33:10] building
[33:12] we've done all this and we've done all
[33:15] that in everything and I put into the
[33:17] winners fund and I do all this there it
[33:21] is the best that I can do take it or
[33:23] leave it
[33:24] but God will leave it
[33:27] right what about all of the good works
[33:30] that people today are doing
[33:35] and yet it's a take it or leave it
[33:37] affair because they're not going to
[33:38] change their attitude
[33:39] right come on
[33:42] he left it there for Cain he will leave
[33:44] it there for you there is a way that
[33:46] seemeth right unto a man
[33:49] but the end thereof is the way of death
[33:50] there's only one provided way for God
[33:53] that's down the bloodstream to the Holy
[33:56] Spirit without that you're done you're
[33:58] finished
[33:59] you'll never go in all right go ahead to
[34:02] the next all the days of our life 1959-8
[34:06] uh
[34:09] sixth whale look at them here kind of
[34:11] fade out okay
[34:15] and he's so much like Kane Cain wanted
[34:17] to be religious so he went and made his
[34:19] own religion
[34:21] and when he did he brought it before God
[34:22] was something like this here's the best
[34:25] I got this is all I can do about it not
[34:28] take it or leave it
[34:30] now
[34:31] without being derogatory
[34:34] to anyone or thoughts or religions or
[34:37] ideas
[34:38] think about the religious world of today
[34:42] and I say the message people
[34:46] you and I
[34:48] so I'm not derogatory to this church
[34:50] over here okay
[34:52] what they are between them and God
[34:55] but you think about it
[34:58] why is it that people will not receive
[35:01] what you have to say about the word
[35:08] when they're a whole lot better than we
[35:10] are
[35:11] right
[35:12] good people
[35:14] religious people worshiping people
[35:19] but present the word to him
[35:24] and see what to do with it right
[35:27] yeah but y'all are just old word people
[35:30] I'm glad you said that
[35:32] we was life another day kind of funny
[35:35] brother Collins was talking about he had
[35:38] a preacher down that preached for him
[35:40] there and said the old preacher got up
[35:42] and told me going to preach on a new
[35:44] thing
[35:45] and uh he got up there and he said now
[35:48] these old barns out here
[35:50] he said you see them old barns he said
[35:52] they need a new coat of paint
[35:55] and he said that's like these women
[35:59] you know we're putting on makeup on your
[36:01] face I started laughing I looked over
[36:03] Donnie and I said I don't want nobody
[36:06] calling my wife a no Barn
[36:12] do you realize that statement people
[36:13] would make the preacher made the
[36:15] statement that the old barn needed a new
[36:18] plane I'd have got up there and said you
[36:20] apologized my wife she ain't no Barn
[36:26] but you say we don't do it so you do the
[36:29] best you can
[36:31] he says here it is
[36:33] best I got this is all I can do about it
[36:36] now take it or leave it what is the
[36:38] church world today saying to God
[36:42] the greatest religious Society of the
[36:44] world ever been probably today
[36:48] and what do they say unto God
[36:51] are they saying we want your word
[36:55] no they want a spirit among them
[36:58] a move
[37:00] that's about the way man does today I
[37:03] helped build a church I sent my children
[37:04] to church there I put the money in it
[37:07] every year and that's the best I can do
[37:09] take it or leave it
[37:11] oh see he wants his own way
[37:16] that's the way Cain did
[37:22] that's what people are saying right
[37:27] look
[37:28] God still loved him
[37:33] and he still went after him
[37:37] right
[37:39] what did God tell Kane
[37:42] you'll do well if you'll do if you'll
[37:44] just worship like your brother Abel and
[37:46] Abel come God's way but Cain wanted his
[37:49] way and God said now Cain I've got
[37:52] nothing against you
[37:54] if you'll just come over and go the way
[37:56] that Abel goes you'll do well
[38:01] the people of the message preach see the
[38:03] Cain can't be saved
[38:05] you've never heard that priest
[38:08] you wasn't listening too much
[38:13] potential lineage it's impossible to be
[38:15] saved
[38:18] and according to the prophet
[38:21] but you know what
[38:23] they'll say I've studied the message and
[38:25] I got this out of the message
[38:27] you take it or leave it
[38:31] right
[38:34] okay
[38:38] look the next one hearing acting and on
[38:41] the word of God 1960.
[38:43] 221
[38:48] but look the church natural is just the
[38:50] church carnal they'll never they're
[38:53] never able to get above that little
[38:56] thing of they see they can't get above
[38:58] that that's the church
[39:00] or you understand what he's saying they
[39:02] can't get above what the church thing is
[39:06] of their churchy thing or the thing to
[39:08] serve God
[39:10] now that's what he's saying they're
[39:12] never able to get above that little
[39:14] thing of
[39:15] I joined church I go to church if I do
[39:18] the best that I can that's all God
[39:20] requires
[39:22] see they can't get above that
[39:24] come about you and I
[39:27] brother told me one time he said I know
[39:29] I'm going to heaven because I pray for
[39:30] the prophet's kids
[39:32] I said well praise God pray for mine too
[39:38] I see you
[39:39] you put it on
[39:41] and people have put it on run around and
[39:43] saw me there
[39:45] so I know I'm going well remember he
[39:47] went to hell
[39:48] and he saw people there
[39:51] of course you know your brother Dale
[39:52] that's just sarcastic
[39:54] he wasn't talking about me then
[39:57] okay you make your choice
[40:01] look
[40:04] thinking well that's all God requires
[40:06] you ever talk to people and say we don't
[40:09] need to know about this water baptism
[40:11] you know why y'all build on stuff like
[40:13] that
[40:14] close higher you know why why do you you
[40:17] say this wrong for a woman to cut her
[40:19] hair
[40:20] and for her not wear makeup or her not
[40:23] to wear pants and things
[40:25] that's just all words God don't look at
[40:27] that he's looking at the heart
[40:31] remember out of the heart proceedeth the
[40:32] whole thing out of the heart comes the
[40:34] pants on the woman
[40:39] I hope some of our new coming visitors
[40:41] are listening
[40:43] do not try not to be too sarcastic
[40:45] and beat people over the head
[40:48] could I remember where I come from and
[40:50] where you come from
[40:52] but the truth is the truth
[40:54] you know
[40:57] oh God requires me to do I go to church
[41:01] I worship I play my tithe
[41:03] I love the Lord
[41:07] now he's putting it in the ways of Cain
[41:10] now that's the same thing Cain doing he
[41:13] went and made an alder he made a
[41:14] sacrifice brought the fruits of the land
[41:15] and he said here it is God that's the
[41:18] best I got take it or leave it that's
[41:20] the way the carnal believer believes
[41:22] today
[41:24] foreign
[41:25] Lord I go to church
[41:28] I'll join the best group that I can find
[41:30] I'll pay in my dues to the church I'll
[41:33] do what's right
[41:35] now here's the best I can do
[41:37] I'll help buy some coal for the winter
[41:40] I'll give the children some clothing
[41:43] it was all right nothing to say against
[41:45] it
[41:48] but that's it that's all if you want it
[41:52] take it
[41:54] if you don't
[41:57] you don't have to take it now that's
[42:00] people saying that to God
[42:03] right
[42:06] people are saying to God if you want it
[42:08] take it if you don't
[42:11] you don't have to take it
[42:12] now that's the attitude of the church
[42:14] carnal today
[42:17] but do we fit in there
[42:20] well brother then what do you want we
[42:21] come to church we you know we do
[42:23] everything we
[42:25] what do you want
[42:27] I want us born again
[42:31] right
[42:33] are you saying we ain't born again
[42:35] no that's left up to you
[42:38] that's not left up to me and I'm glad of
[42:40] it
[42:41] I ain't never told nobody that's born
[42:43] again
[42:44] because I can't
[42:48] you can deceive me
[42:52] I just tell you what a Christian will do
[42:54] and I'll tell you what a sinner will do
[42:56] then we'd have to find our own way
[42:59] all right
[43:01] look at the next one an uncertain sound
[43:03] 1961 315.
[43:07] e37
[43:09] if an order of Cain came to cry of a
[43:12] land able excuse me came a crime in the
[43:14] Land There was death to pay the penalty
[43:15] blood was being shed and today God just
[43:19] like it was in that day when he told
[43:21] Cain
[43:22] was discouraged he said here's the best
[43:25] I can do you can take it or leave it do
[43:28] anything you want to about it but that's
[43:31] all I can do about it
[43:34] that's the way the modern church
[43:37] worshipers today
[43:39] I go to church
[43:45] what about it where do we fit
[43:50] he said but brother Dale
[43:52] you said while ago that
[43:55] everybody in the world
[43:59] was either marked with the mark of the
[44:00] beast or the Seal of God
[44:05] all right and remember now the prophet
[44:07] said and we'll read it he said you're
[44:09] already marked
[44:11] he said the punishment comes later
[44:13] do you realize if you're not born again
[44:17] what are you
[44:19] the domain of Satan
[44:22] right
[44:23] so then everybody now
[44:25] There's No Gray areas
[44:29] you said but this person over here is is
[44:32] coming through justification and
[44:35] sanctification that's good but they're
[44:36] not in the Kingdom
[44:41] they're not in the Kingdom till they get
[44:42] the baptism when the Holy Ghost
[44:44] all right what about you
[44:47] look at the next one
[44:49] this is the true Easter seal 61
[44:52] um 402 uh
[44:55] paragraph 159.
[45:00] and they refused his messiahship when
[45:02] they showed them
[45:03] when he showed them he was the Messiah
[45:07] they were forced to say something
[45:10] now watch this
[45:16] and so are they today
[45:19] turning it down
[45:21] and won't sponsor him
[45:22] and washing their hands from it
[45:26] the decision is forced upon them
[45:33] there's no Middle Road
[45:39] we're at the end time
[45:41] man's forced to receive it
[45:45] or reject it
[45:47] right one or the other no middle grade
[45:54] you've got to accept it or turn it away
[45:56] it's forced upon America watch
[46:00] it's forced on the Branham Tabernacle
[46:09] we got to make a choice random
[46:11] Tabernacle let's make a choice
[46:14] is forced on the Pentecostals on the
[46:16] Methodist it's forced on Forest
[46:18] everywhere
[46:20] you have to take it or leave it
[46:23] then there's a few of those taken or
[46:25] leave it is not talking just about Cain
[46:27] so if you look them up you'll find some
[46:29] good things
[46:32] God has confirmed his word
[46:35] showing his signs back in his ministry
[46:37] showing exactly what he is by proving
[46:40] that he's God
[46:42] all right now what are we going to do
[46:46] now let's make a showdown
[46:51] no random Tabernacle got to make a
[46:54] decision
[46:56] Lula Georgia's got to make a decision
[47:00] all right
[47:02] no middle grounds make a decision
[47:07] now
[47:09] we're going to put this take it or leave
[47:11] it
[47:12] in the mark of the beast together
[47:16] all right so we want to read what he
[47:19] says
[47:20] go ahead with number seven
[47:22] East 70 the mark of the beast and the
[47:24] Seal of God number 2 61 2 17.
[47:30] after it's brought right up to you and
[47:32] showed you
[47:33] that is the Seal of God
[47:36] just because of prestige
[47:40] I was listening we was the other day
[47:42] where we had mentioned about that
[47:45] remember the Holy Ghost tried to come on
[47:46] who was he
[47:48] uh Saint Augustine a hippo we was
[47:51] listening where brother Branham you know
[47:52] and I told you I didn't know what went
[47:54] on but there was something there that he
[47:56] turned that down or something because
[47:57] the Holy Ghost couldn't come on him and
[47:59] we just hit the tape last night and I
[48:01] was running around him explaining it
[48:03] that that's what happened at Saint
[48:05] Augustine of Hippo knew what he'd lose
[48:09] the Holy Ghost tried to come on him
[48:13] because now he says that Martin and
[48:16] hippos together
[48:18] that's that's what brother run says so
[48:20] you know all right I'll get you to tell
[48:22] you if you want
[48:25] just because of prestige you have to
[48:27] give up something or you quit your
[48:29] denomination or something to receive it
[48:32] and then walk away from it
[48:34] you know what you do you seal yourself
[48:36] out of the Kingdom
[48:38] mark of the beast
[48:42] now people will say because of a quote
[48:44] brother around a mate run around and
[48:46] said it's God's obligated to put a man
[48:47] on the pulpit to answer your question
[48:49] I've had people to tell me
[48:52] God's obligated to come to my church and
[48:55] put it on the platform in my church
[48:58] for me to hear it
[49:01] I wish stood at the end and I still do
[49:02] today I'll say nope that ain't right
[49:04] because the prophet said too that if
[49:07] your pastor Don't Preach the truth you
[49:09] get away from your pastor
[49:11] all right
[49:14] sure God's obligated to bring you the
[49:16] truth
[49:19] but he's not obligated to bring it to
[49:21] your church that's
[49:23] something added to the quote
[49:28] all right but now listen
[49:32] you seal yourself out of the Kingdom
[49:34] mark of the beast when God told Abel or
[49:37] told Cain said just go over and worship
[49:40] like your brother bring a lamb come down
[49:42] here and worship like your brother said
[49:44] you will do it right you'll do all right
[49:47] do as your brother does
[49:50] you'd be all right
[49:52] but he wouldn't do it said this is the
[49:55] best that I can offer and you can take
[49:57] it or leave it
[49:59] and he was marked
[50:02] and went out of the presence of God
[50:07] when he was saying you take it or leave
[50:09] it
[50:11] we read in the scripture you read on
[50:13] down a little bit and then he was marked
[50:16] right
[50:18] take it or leave it you go out
[50:22] look what this one says the mark of the
[50:24] beast
[50:26] the Seal of God number two
[50:29] 61-17 East e 73.
[50:33] but if you hear the trumpet see hearing
[50:36] Faith cometh by what hearing
[50:39] now not not just listening listen with
[50:42] your ear but if you hear that means you
[50:44] understand it you accept it I hear it I
[50:47] believe it see it's hearing Stephen said
[50:50] you stiff-necked uncircumcised and hard
[50:52] and ears the uncircumcised they could
[50:54] hear it with their ears but
[50:56] uncircumcised they couldn't believe it
[50:58] uncircumcised in the heart and ears
[51:02] me understand it oh it's all a mystery
[51:05] to me like Cain
[51:08] take it or leave it
[51:10] I joined church that's as good as I can
[51:12] do all right Kane
[51:15] you'll Mark with the Beast and go right
[51:17] on off in your denomination
[51:25] which you can come to Christ
[51:28] and be sealed
[51:31] of the Holy Ghost
[51:33] you can take your choice and watch you
[51:35] hear the gospel trumpet what is a gospel
[51:37] Trump the good news the Holy Ghost is
[51:39] here
[51:40] how do you know it is it watch it works
[51:42] see what it does it's the good news
[51:45] oh yeah
[51:49] look at the next one
[51:52] or let's get on to this
[51:55] let's get on to this and then I know we
[51:56] won't have time tonight to cover it we
[51:58] don't want to get up to a point
[52:01] look I don't want to Anchor something in
[52:03] you
[52:03] where you'll think about it
[52:07] McCain said unto the Lord Genesis 4 13.
[52:11] My Punishment is greater than I can bear
[52:14] them
[52:16] behold thou has driven me out this day
[52:18] from the face of the Earth
[52:20] and from thy face shall I be hid now
[52:23] shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in
[52:26] the earth and it shall come to Pious
[52:27] that everyone that findeth me shall slay
[52:30] me
[52:32] now watch
[52:35] that's where I want you to deal on this
[52:36] scripture a long time
[52:41] we'll get to it later what is the mark
[52:43] of the beast
[52:46] it's in your forehead right 666 the
[52:49] vicarious Philly Idis and the thing
[52:52] the trinitarian doctrine in your
[52:55] forehead
[52:58] is the mark of the beast
[53:00] it wasn't something stamped on Cain
[53:04] there is no 666 stamped on your forehead
[53:10] right
[53:11] it's a trinitarian Doctrine
[53:14] if we got the trinitarian doctrine we
[53:16] got the mark of the beast now
[53:19] I know you don't like for me to say
[53:21] these things but
[53:23] it doesn't matter whether you're in a
[53:25] denomination and have a trinitarian
[53:26] Doctrine or where you're sitting in Lula
[53:28] Church
[53:29] our pastor and Lula church if we got a
[53:32] denominational Doctrine is contrary to
[53:34] one true and living God then we're
[53:35] trinitarians
[53:37] and we're already marked with the mark
[53:39] of the beast
[53:41] punishment will come later we can prove
[53:43] those points right but look
[53:46] and the Lord said unto him
[53:50] now remember the Lord still dealing with
[53:51] him big old capital little Rd
[53:55] therefore whosoever slave Cain
[53:59] Vision shall be taken on him 7-4
[54:04] and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest
[54:07] any finding him should kill him
[54:11] no
[54:18] God put a mark on Cain
[54:24] we'll prove that if we don't get through
[54:25] tonight
[54:27] that's the mark of the beast
[54:30] that's what your Prophet said
[54:31] he said first time it was done it was
[54:33] done in the garden
[54:37] but I want you to think about that
[54:38] scripture
[54:40] because I know years ago it come upon my
[54:43] talks about that scripture a lot
[54:46] and I wrote it in my Bible like this
[54:52] you ever thought about God
[54:55] protecting Cain
[55:03] McCain said
[55:05] anybody finds me going to kill me
[55:13] we want to run it to the mark of the
[55:14] beast then we want to run it through
[55:16] ideas we're thinking that it's blackness
[55:21] you've heard that right
[55:26] the Blackness was put on Cain
[55:31] Blackness was put on ham
[55:39] well
[55:41] wouldn't it be kind of a problem we need
[55:43] to think about that if Blackness was the
[55:45] thing that was put on Cain what about us
[55:48] it's about half black
[55:55] come on
[55:59] are we Hive cars
[56:03] we'll prove by the prophet gonna know we
[56:05] won't deny it but the prophet said
[56:07] Blackness is not a curse
[56:10] he said if it is the Jews would be half
[56:12] cursed
[56:13] they'll say half black
[56:15] he said the curse is to reject God
[56:19] so there wasn't a physical Mark placed
[56:21] on Cain he wasn't standing here one
[56:24] color
[56:26] another color
[56:28] or he was standing here
[56:30] brown-headed
[56:32] and a great big glowing light was placed
[56:35] up over his head
[56:37] and God said no everybody leave a lot
[56:39] alone now
[56:42] what happened there
[56:49] Kane said they'll kill me
[56:53] and you know
[56:55] that Adam
[56:58] should have killed Cain
[57:00] Rider
[57:03] now wait a minute now you know what well
[57:05] you don't either so forget it just
[57:07] talking
[57:14] I mean if
[57:16] if one of your boys killed the other one
[57:19] you ought to at least have some
[57:20] punishment right
[57:23] I mean
[57:24] you know
[57:29] come on
[57:31] one of your kids kill the other one
[57:33] brother right
[57:34] what are you gonna do okay I got another
[57:37] one just go kill that too
[57:43] right
[57:45] come on
[57:49] what did God do there
[57:58] I'm asking the question you got an
[58:00] answer what'd he do
[58:03] well he put the mark on him well what
[58:05] was the mark what was it
[58:07] what color was it what distinction
[58:14] I'm just asking a simple question
[58:22] Terence you got two boys
[58:25] one of them killed the other one you're
[58:26] gonna go Pat him on the backs he's doing
[58:28] a good job boy
[58:31] no you say you're silly
[58:33] don't I'm getting a point across it'll
[58:35] ring the bell when you see it
[58:40] God took the hate
[58:42] possibility away from Adam
[58:48] or away from Seth that came on later
[58:52] got to remember Cain was still alive
[58:54] when Seth become a grown man
[59:01] saith would have been saying Cain killed
[59:04] my brother
[59:06] what I need to do
[59:12] what do you think took place I'm up for
[59:14] questions come on
[59:16] I just wrote it in my Bible a long time
[59:18] ago I said look what God can do
[59:22] he can cover a lot of things
[59:25] Cain said they'll kill me
[59:28] God said anybody that killed you he said
[59:31] it'll be Sevenfold
[59:33] against him
[59:37] he took the hate away
[59:40] just as he did from Esau when Jacob was
[59:44] returning
[59:47] and thought everything was he was going
[59:49] to get killed
[59:51] at least and we was the other day to
[59:53] attack and brought around and said see
[59:55] there
[59:56] he said God took that out of Esau
[1:00:01] to take care of
[1:00:06] his brother
[1:00:09] God took the hate out of Esau's mind
[1:00:13] when he gets there Esau looks at him and
[1:00:15] says
[1:00:16] brother I just don't waste you no more
[1:00:20] let's just put everything down forget it
[1:00:23] he's look I'm rich I don't need nothing
[1:00:25] you remember Esau sin all of us
[1:00:28] Jacob sent all this stuff ahead to give
[1:00:30] to him
[1:00:32] brother Ron said he took the hatred out
[1:00:34] of he saw his heart
[1:00:36] man
[1:00:38] what do you think was given well it was
[1:00:40] a market to me well what color is it
[1:00:42] what Mark is it
[1:00:48] what is the mark of the beast it's in
[1:00:49] your forehead
[1:00:51] in it doesn't say on
[1:00:55] read your Bible we'll get to the
[1:00:57] scriptures
[1:00:58] it's in your forehead it's in your
[1:01:00] intelligence
[1:01:04] when God put the mark of the beast on
[1:01:06] Cain he looked no different one second
[1:01:08] that he did the next second
[1:01:12] but I'm just trying to get a point to
[1:01:13] you
[1:01:16] God
[1:01:18] didn't set a mark of the beast
[1:01:21] to protect him
[1:01:24] because that would have been God
[1:01:26] making him go into unbelief
[1:01:31] I hope that rings
[1:01:34] you can't make God guilty of
[1:01:37] causing unbelief to come upon Cain
[1:01:40] getting in the wrong category
[1:01:44] but God protected Cain
[1:01:48] he took out of the hearts of those
[1:01:52] that was against him
[1:01:55] and they didn't want to kill him
[1:01:57] then the mark of the beast appears pull
[1:02:00] up back up now brother and we'll read it
[1:02:02] then the mark of the beast appeared
[1:02:09] lord said unto him therefore whosoever
[1:02:11] sleth came
[1:02:13] Vengeance shall be taken on him 7-4
[1:02:17] and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest
[1:02:20] any finding him should kill him
[1:02:24] it looks like he's putting the mark of
[1:02:25] the beast on him to keep him from being
[1:02:27] killed so what is the mark of the beast
[1:02:28] it's in his forehead
[1:02:35] where would that be protecting him
[1:02:40] where would it be protecting Cain would
[1:02:42] Cain to have the mark of the beast in
[1:02:44] his forehead
[1:02:45] what protection would God be placing
[1:02:47] there
[1:02:54] in the mark of the beast is what Cain
[1:02:56] had
[1:02:59] all right
[1:03:00] I'll go any further I'll have to get
[1:03:02] into some things here
[1:03:04] but let me just scan this
[1:03:09] see we think Blackness is a curse
[1:03:12] if you'll read go into questions and
[1:03:15] answers book two par uh paragraph 153
[1:03:19] through about
[1:03:21] one
[1:03:24] 65.
[1:03:26] you'll hear Brother Branham explaining
[1:03:27] that Blackness is not a curse
[1:03:31] you hear him explaining that
[1:03:34] you think that ham was cursed
[1:03:40] skin through and read it
[1:03:43] ham was cursed
[1:03:45] was ham turned black
[1:03:54] we want to try to put some kind of
[1:03:57] something
[1:03:59] like we'll get down to it
[1:04:02] eventually
[1:04:04] brother random says people think that
[1:04:06] Cain went over in the Land of Nod and
[1:04:09] married an ape a monkey
[1:04:11] and said that's where the black people
[1:04:13] come from
[1:04:18] you've heard him say it right
[1:04:20] and he says that ain't right
[1:04:25] you can't mix a monkey and a man
[1:04:28] if you could wind up with some form of
[1:04:30] the Beast left you'd have a possibility
[1:04:33] the word he can't get his wife
[1:04:36] he took his own sister right
[1:04:38] right where else did he get it I'll
[1:04:39] prove it to you and run around and said
[1:04:41] there wasn't no other race for it to
[1:04:42] come from
[1:04:43] he took his sister because girls were
[1:04:46] not put into lineages
[1:04:48] remember Cain and Abel were both
[1:04:52] 20 years old or something
[1:04:57] but think about it
[1:05:00] and then I want to say one thing
[1:05:07] what's the difference in the
[1:05:10] seal of God
[1:05:12] in the mark of the beast
[1:05:21] why is it they're both in your forehead
[1:05:29] let's read what the prophet says the
[1:05:31] difference is look at number 12 brother
[1:05:36] and we'll go back over these next
[1:05:37] Wednesday or whenever I get around to
[1:05:39] preaching on brother Cloud to be here
[1:05:41] this weekend
[1:05:43] look what he says now mark of the beast
[1:05:47] and seal of God
[1:05:51] it's not the Seal of the Beast and the
[1:05:54] mark of God
[1:05:59] a mark is a distinction
[1:06:01] it makes a difference it separates
[1:06:04] something like you say you've got one
[1:06:05] Mark against you Lamar but you never
[1:06:08] said you had one seal against you
[1:06:12] come on
[1:06:16] you got one Mark against you
[1:06:18] in a seal
[1:06:20] is a sign of ownership
[1:06:24] a mark is a distinction
[1:06:30] and the church is sealed by the Holy
[1:06:32] Spirit showing ownership
[1:06:34] God owns a church but the mark of the
[1:06:37] beast is the Wayward the outcast that
[1:06:40] refused to take and come God's provided
[1:06:43] way
[1:06:44] Cain as soon as he was marked was sent
[1:06:46] away
[1:06:47] we got that Abel died and Seth raised up
[1:06:50] to take his place was a sign of the
[1:06:52] Resurrection
[1:06:54] or do you understand
[1:06:57] it doesn't say the mark of God
[1:07:02] says the Seal of God
[1:07:04] with the mark of the beast
[1:07:10] the Mark is a distinction
[1:07:13] you know a separation
[1:07:18] the church is sealed by the Holy Spirit
[1:07:25] but what about when we get over the
[1:07:27] scripture or not back up on this
[1:07:30] next service
[1:07:36] mark them that sigh and cry for the
[1:07:38] Abominations done in the city
[1:07:43] you can use Mark and
[1:07:45] sealed together in God's way of doing
[1:07:48] things
[1:07:51] what about over in Revelations about
[1:07:56] the Seal of God in their forehead
[1:08:05] I know you're quiet
[1:08:08] of course you generally always real
[1:08:09] quiet anyway but that's no problem
[1:08:11] you just gotta real because you're
[1:08:13] wondering what in the world am I talking
[1:08:14] about
[1:08:17] you're trying to figure it out so just
[1:08:19] trying to figure it out I'll just tell
[1:08:20] you what I'm talking about
[1:08:25] I'm talking about what I've tried to
[1:08:27] explain to you for 40 something years
[1:08:32] that God has to use the same channel
[1:08:36] to get to you
[1:08:40] that the devil uses
[1:08:45] which is through your head
[1:08:49] down through your spirit
[1:08:54] right
[1:08:58] and anointed ones
[1:09:03] now I'm asking you a question
[1:09:06] those anointed ones have
[1:09:09] the mark of God or the Seal of God
[1:09:18] now come on as anointed ones right
[1:09:24] if they're sealed
[1:09:28] you got a problem
[1:09:33] but get the point down through the same
[1:09:35] channel
[1:09:38] that God uses to speak to you and I the
[1:09:40] devil uses the same channel
[1:09:49] to try to get to us
[1:09:54] all right
[1:09:58] but brother Dale I thought the Seal of
[1:10:00] God was in your soul
[1:10:04] I do and I believe it is
[1:10:07] you're sealed in Satan sealed out
[1:10:11] but just remember
[1:10:14] through the brain and through the memory
[1:10:16] reason conscious effects Satan can still
[1:10:19] get to you
[1:10:21] sure
[1:10:24] I heard a man years ago
[1:10:26] that we really need our blind baptized
[1:10:29] with the Holy Ghost
[1:10:31] and I said amen
[1:10:37] now
[1:10:38] let me preach a little Doctrine point
[1:10:40] for a minute
[1:10:45] what is the new birth
[1:10:50] is worth of the word
[1:10:53] why is it that some people can be
[1:10:56] anointed say the uh what was his name
[1:11:00] well I don't know
[1:11:02] Pope wound up
[1:11:06] Saint augustino hippo he rejected the
[1:11:09] Holy Spirit right the prophet said it in
[1:11:12] did that mean he wasn't religious
[1:11:17] um
[1:11:21] and you know that in his forehead was
[1:11:24] truth trying to develop
[1:11:29] why is it that it's so hard to
[1:11:32] understand anointed ones and how you can
[1:11:34] be Anointed with the Holy Spirit
[1:11:37] because you're not anointed
[1:11:39] in your soul
[1:11:41] you're anointing on your spirit right
[1:11:46] your spirit is memory reason conscious
[1:11:48] affections Etc
[1:11:50] anointing
[1:11:53] then what is the new birth
[1:11:56] is the birth of the word
[1:11:58] remember the Bible said that
[1:12:02] some took the word in The Parables and
[1:12:05] they held it
[1:12:07] and the prophet said the Holy Ghost came
[1:12:09] and quickened that word
[1:12:16] now it's the same thing Brother Gary
[1:12:18] I've always tried to preach
[1:12:22] we talk about them people being anointed
[1:12:24] ones
[1:12:28] if you have the new birth today you're
[1:12:29] an anointed one
[1:12:35] oh boy
[1:12:45] because every person that ever gets born
[1:12:48] again
[1:12:49] the Holy Ghost has got to come down
[1:12:51] through your
[1:12:52] brain through your memory your reason
[1:12:54] your conscience
[1:12:58] why does it say and some took the word
[1:13:00] and held it
[1:13:02] cares of Life Etc took the others away
[1:13:04] right did he take them away to the world
[1:13:06] of sin no no they become religious and
[1:13:09] they become anointed ones
[1:13:10] see when the Holy Ghost is coming down
[1:13:12] on you watch it about the
[1:13:16] the Pope
[1:13:20] why did it not come on that man
[1:13:28] he didn't want to give up what he had
[1:13:31] right
[1:13:33] he had a pope he didn't want to give up
[1:13:35] what he had
[1:13:36] receive the Holy Ghost but the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost came down on his Spirit to anoint
[1:13:40] him
[1:13:44] had to get close for him to turn it down
[1:13:49] see I believe the new birth
[1:13:52] is the birth of the word
[1:13:56] amen and that's why there was 120 in the
[1:13:57] upper room
[1:14:00] not 500 that was seen after Jesus's
[1:14:03] resurrection
[1:14:06] right
[1:14:07] the Bible said he was seen of over 500
[1:14:09] brethren
[1:14:11] they didn't come up to
[1:14:13] get the Holy Ghost on the day of
[1:14:15] Pentecost
[1:14:16] might have got it later ain't got no
[1:14:18] problems with that
[1:14:21] but they wasn't there on a death
[1:14:22] Pentecost why
[1:14:25] why would that Pope
[1:14:29] what was wrong there
[1:14:32] because he had something in his soul it
[1:14:34] wasn't right
[1:14:40] you see it's supposed to be
[1:14:45] that sanctification that unclean spirit
[1:14:48] is supposed to be driven out of your
[1:14:49] soul
[1:14:50] right
[1:14:52] where the Holy Ghost can come in
[1:14:56] but what if it's not driven out
[1:14:58] Holy Ghost can't come in
[1:15:01] but he can come down as far as your
[1:15:03] spirit and anoint you
[1:15:05] come on what is the new bird
[1:15:07] is this the birth of the word
[1:15:10] all right
[1:15:12] if it's a verse of the word the Holy
[1:15:14] Spirit comes down upon the word you have
[1:15:17] held
[1:15:20] there's your new birth
[1:15:23] but to others that just take part of the
[1:15:25] word
[1:15:27] and because of prestige because of jobs
[1:15:30] because of their churches it comes down
[1:15:33] and tries to come on them
[1:15:35] and he can't come on them because they
[1:15:37] got it closed out
[1:15:40] but yet they can shout Glory Hallelujah
[1:15:42] just as good as anybody else
[1:15:44] and they wind up being anointed ones
[1:15:48] sister gay and what is that you've heard
[1:15:49] it's birth of the word
[1:15:52] you took in your heart and waited for
[1:15:54] the Holy Spirit to make it alive
[1:15:58] but what if in your heart you doubt it
[1:16:01] God can't make it alive
[1:16:05] so all of that I read and all of that
[1:16:08] when we're you know God is a good God
[1:16:11] God knows I want him
[1:16:17] come on
[1:16:24] you mean that Pope said I don't want God
[1:16:27] no
[1:16:30] ain't no man in the world to say that
[1:16:31] one God
[1:16:36] new verse the birth of the word
[1:16:38] some took the word in hell and the Holy
[1:16:40] Spirit could Quicken it some took the
[1:16:42] word and let others interpret it
[1:16:47] now you see one that I've always said
[1:16:49] brother random in his early Ministry
[1:16:52] used to let others preach
[1:16:55] am I right
[1:16:58] and then he would come out and pray for
[1:17:00] the sick
[1:17:02] right
[1:17:04] why did he stop that
[1:17:12] I wouldn't want to pray
[1:17:14] for people to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:17:17] when the preachers up preaching a
[1:17:19] trinity would you
[1:17:23] I'd say hold it Brothers get on the
[1:17:25] truth
[1:17:25] and plant a seed in the heart of the
[1:17:27] people
[1:17:30] and then the Holy Ghost can fall
[1:17:32] and Quicken the word what's the
[1:17:34] difference an anointed one
[1:17:36] you and I are anointed ones
[1:17:39] come on you don't want to be an anointed
[1:17:41] one
[1:17:44] no but I just don't want to be a an
[1:17:46] anointed one is just an anointed one I
[1:17:49] don't either
[1:17:51] but it's all determined on whether or
[1:17:52] not we can hold the word
[1:17:56] and cherish that word and receive that
[1:17:58] word that's what determines whether or
[1:18:01] not the Holy Spirit can give birth to
[1:18:03] that word he can't give birth to a false
[1:18:06] seed right
[1:18:08] that's why you don't have as a prophet
[1:18:10] said too many or how did he say it you
[1:18:13] don't have very many new births
[1:18:17] right why
[1:18:21] but are you going to be like the man
[1:18:22] told me he said I took my wife
[1:18:24] to a Pentecostal Church to get her free
[1:18:27] in the spirit and then he knows he call
[1:18:29] he he knew he'd done goofed up and he
[1:18:32] started back peddling
[1:18:35] you know he didn't want to finish his
[1:18:36] sentence I said now brother you just
[1:18:38] tell me
[1:18:39] that you think of Pentecostal
[1:18:42] you can get the Holy Ghost to come on
[1:18:43] your wife
[1:18:45] better than somebody preaching the truth
[1:18:52] that's why there's very few new births
[1:18:54] people don't preach the truth
[1:18:57] they preach come up here Shout Scream
[1:18:59] holler Shakey do whatever
[1:19:02] I'm nothing against it
[1:19:04] I don't have anything against it
[1:19:07] I've seen them in Jamaica I'm not a
[1:19:09] Pentecostal come through a lot but I did
[1:19:11] see them there take the little kid's
[1:19:13] mouth come on come on sweet come on
[1:19:19] what trying to get them speak in tongues
[1:19:27] you can speak in tongues every day your
[1:19:29] life and I go hey all right
[1:19:32] you can be anointed on your spirit
[1:19:33] everyday life go to hell
[1:19:37] but my point is don't ever think that
[1:19:39] you're not an anointed one
[1:19:41] anointed one means Christ
[1:19:43] it's Christ's own those people right
[1:19:47] around said to genuine the Holy Ghost
[1:19:52] but why they're not born again
[1:19:58] you that been to these count meetings
[1:20:00] and I'm not against them
[1:20:02] especially the youth
[1:20:05] they get a lot of commitments in these
[1:20:06] youth meetings right
[1:20:09] but the next time they have one they got
[1:20:10] the same people in the altar with
[1:20:13] another commitment
[1:20:16] why don't you get somebody in there to
[1:20:17] preach
[1:20:19] you don't have to preach see those
[1:20:20] plagues Thunders fight preach the new
[1:20:22] birth
[1:20:24] justification sanctification and the
[1:20:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:30] why don't you give somebody to preach
[1:20:31] like that
[1:20:33] you might see kids getting born again
[1:20:37] instead of that you got the kids in
[1:20:38] order the next year
[1:20:41] seeking God
[1:20:42] right around and said you make come on
[1:20:44] twofold Child of hell
[1:20:47] than you did to start with
[1:20:52] see it is the mark of the beast
[1:20:58] but it's the Seal of God
[1:21:00] now
[1:21:01] wake up a second and listen
[1:21:06] I thought we believed
[1:21:09] in being born again
[1:21:13] I thought we believed that getting the
[1:21:15] new birth was just the beginning
[1:21:20] am I right
[1:21:22] I thought we believed in the statue of a
[1:21:25] perfect man
[1:21:27] is to add to your faith virtue or
[1:21:29] knowledge Temperance praise God
[1:21:32] I thought we believed that a birth was a
[1:21:34] coming forth into
[1:21:40] I'll back up on this next time because I
[1:21:42] know it's going to be hard to put it
[1:21:44] right here I told brother Donnie today
[1:21:46] I said I'd give anything for a way to
[1:21:49] explain
[1:21:50] what I see
[1:21:56] why does it say
[1:22:00] the Seal of God is in your forehead
[1:22:05] your Prophet said it does
[1:22:07] the Bible says
[1:22:12] and it's the Seal of God in there
[1:22:14] forehead why
[1:22:19] do you understand what's going to bring
[1:22:22] a Rapture Brother Gary
[1:22:24] we've talked about just a little bit
[1:22:25] Ryan
[1:22:27] what's going to bring a rapture
[1:22:31] when God can seal
[1:22:35] that forehead
[1:22:39] with the seal he's got sealed in your
[1:22:41] heart
[1:22:46] can I do it
[1:22:51] come on folks
[1:22:57] we are being born again
[1:23:00] we're being sealed in our forehead
[1:23:05] I'm still in my heart you ain't
[1:23:07] listening
[1:23:09] you get to steal in your heart that's a
[1:23:11] new birth
[1:23:12] you get to seal of God in your forehead
[1:23:15] by the message or the hour that is
[1:23:18] revealed to you and I that will bring us
[1:23:21] up the statue of a perfect man
[1:23:26] being born again
[1:23:28] okay that's what the Bible's right when
[1:23:30] it's
[1:23:32] you got the Seal of God in your forehead
[1:23:40] in your intelligence
[1:23:43] is the only way that God can contact you
[1:23:51] and that's the way you get a revelation
[1:23:55] is through your intelligence
[1:23:59] through your spirit into your soul
[1:24:03] the prophet said the Holy Ghost is
[1:24:05] sitting in your soul
[1:24:09] waiting on you to bring him the word
[1:24:14] now that's what your Prophet said you
[1:24:16] want that quote
[1:24:18] waiting on you to bring in the word he
[1:24:20] said then he can make it alive
[1:24:22] why because Faith cometh by
[1:24:27] hearing
[1:24:29] and hearing by the word
[1:24:32] what's going to change these beings that
[1:24:33] we are
[1:24:36] when God can drive out all of our
[1:24:39] intelligence that is contrary to his
[1:24:42] word
[1:24:45] right and that's got to be from the
[1:24:47] inside outwardly
[1:24:50] and then he can seal that forehead
[1:24:58] so
[1:25:00] brother there you sound like you believe
[1:25:01] in two or three seals
[1:25:05] I believe in being born again
[1:25:10] I believe in a growth development in the
[1:25:12] word of the hour
[1:25:15] you see church that's why I've preached
[1:25:16] so hard
[1:25:19] trying my best to get you and I
[1:25:22] you and I
[1:25:24] to a place
[1:25:26] that God can speak through these brains
[1:25:30] that we've got
[1:25:32] and it not be a cut off Channel
[1:25:36] down into the soul until we can stand
[1:25:40] right there and look right at it and say
[1:25:42] that's it
[1:25:44] come on folks you ever been healed
[1:25:49] you ever been instantly healed
[1:25:52] have you ever received a revelation
[1:25:56] come on you ever received a revelation
[1:25:58] what happens
[1:26:03] the god in here is waiting on you to
[1:26:04] bring him the word
[1:26:07] and when you bring him the word
[1:26:09] he makes it alive
[1:26:12] we're being sealed in our foreheads
[1:26:14] let's stand
[1:26:19] being sealed in our foreheads
[1:26:22] but let's just don't let this
[1:26:24] take it or leave it thing go out as to
[1:26:26] be the mark of the beast
[1:26:33] because it'll cause death
[1:26:36] one brings life the other brain's death
[1:26:39] right
[1:26:43] what about it
[1:26:46] I don't understand you brother Dale
[1:26:50] I don't either
[1:26:52] I don't understand me either
[1:26:57] but I know I have one desire
[1:27:01] and I got to preach to your head but now
[1:27:03] you know yourself
[1:27:05] what I'm fixing to say that I've said
[1:27:06] many times I don't just speak to heads
[1:27:11] heads I don't do no good
[1:27:14] I try to speak to your heart
[1:27:18] if you just open up enough
[1:27:22] is that on souls in prison
[1:27:25] he said if he can get that
[1:27:27] soul to stand still long enough
[1:27:31] he's explaining the new birth
[1:27:34] he said if he can get that soul to stand
[1:27:36] still longer he said that soul will die
[1:27:43] the nature of that being will go out and
[1:27:45] God can come in
[1:27:48] you see what I've preached on the new
[1:27:49] birth I've been waiting on somebody
[1:27:51] somewhere to
[1:27:53] help me preach the new birth
[1:27:57] like I said the other day I would leave
[1:27:58] right today
[1:27:59] if I knew they were places in Africa
[1:28:02] that people were preaching according to
[1:28:04] what I understand a little bit about
[1:28:06] I would just leave and go fly there
[1:28:09] then I'd go to anywhere else I could go
[1:28:13] because I believe God is revealing his
[1:28:15] word
[1:28:16] it's not just in Lula
[1:28:18] never taught nothing like that
[1:28:21] I'd love to go and just listen
[1:28:24] I don't want to go preach
[1:28:26] I won't go listen
[1:28:29] I want to hear somebody talk about God
[1:28:30] that I've the God that I see
[1:28:34] I want to hear somebody talk about the
[1:28:35] New Birth then I see that Jesus said
[1:28:38] they cut the word and held it
[1:28:42] and the Holy Ghost came and quickened it
[1:28:47] but the others didn't hold it
[1:28:49] they didn't count it honorable
[1:28:52] so thereby when the Holy Ghost fell it
[1:28:54] couldn't fall on them
[1:28:58] you see one there's not very few new
[1:29:00] births
[1:29:02] and not a lot of new births go ahead
[1:29:04] brother what we got 103.
[1:29:09] you have longed
[1:29:27] but you can't not have rest
[1:29:36] until all
[1:29:38] until that forehead is clean
[1:29:45] concealed by the Holy Spirit
[1:29:58] anybody have a need
[1:30:05] and how peace
[1:30:14] few days
[1:30:26] got to go for blood work tomorrow
[1:30:30] he's also having a hurting in the back
[1:30:32] of his head
[1:30:35] so let's just believe
[1:30:37] let's believe God will touch that hurt
[1:30:39] in his head but let's believe that that
[1:30:41] blood work will be all right
[1:30:42] all right father my brother said he's
[1:30:46] hurting in the back of his head
[1:30:49] we lay our hands our condemning that
[1:30:51] hurt
[1:30:52] we believe you we believe it because of
[1:30:55] what Lord we preached about you
[1:30:59] we want the birth of the word we want
[1:31:02] that word revealed our brother that says
[1:31:04] by your stripes he's healed
[1:31:07] and Lord let work will be all right
