[3:23] don't count that you know I I count that
[3:25] just to being under the curse I don't
[3:28] count that as being a well the devil's
[3:30] really after me well he's after
[3:32] everybody in the world and because you
[3:35] know this that age I just counted the
[3:37] fact that you know that he's given me
[3:39] the opportunity to believe his word and
[3:42] then that way I can just keep right on
[3:44] going and thanking him for healing me

[4:02] the Healer the deliverer the god to our
[4:05] lives and thank you for saving us mainly
[4:07] Lord because that's greater than
[4:09] anything else and we pray that you'd
[4:11] bless us tonight in speaking of your
[4:14] word
[4:15] that you'd come on the scene to the
[4:16] people and Quicken that word Lord and
[4:18] then doing that then truly they would be
[4:21] healed by the revealed word because we
[4:23] believe it and we thank you and we just
[4:25] commit everything to you Lord remember

[4:39] love you we thank you forgive our sins
[4:41] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[4:44] guide us in Jesus name amen
[4:49] and like I've told you uh I'm still in a
[4:52] jug inside my head with
[4:55] you know water I reckon on my eardrums
[4:58] or something so if I get a little loud
[5:01] pull it and do whatever you have to
[5:02] control it because I I can't I don't
[5:05] know why I don't know how I lied to
[5:08] holler
[5:09] you know so if I holler too loud y'all
[5:11] tell me huh
[5:13] Romans 8 28.
[5:15] and we know that all things work
[5:17] together for good to them that love God
[5:19] to them who are thee called according to
[5:22] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[5:25] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[5:28] the image of his son that he might be
[5:30] the firstborn among many brethren
[5:32] moreover
[5:34] whom he did predestinate then he also
[5:38] called
[5:39] in whom he called them he also justified
[5:41] in whom he justified them he also
[5:43] glorified what shall we then say to
[5:46] these things if God be for us who can be
[5:49] against us they don't want to be an amen
[5:51] to all of us
[5:52] all right look at Colossians
[5:55] because we want to pick up a thought
[5:56] just a little higher tonight and move up
[5:58] Colossians 1.
[6:01] is speaking about Christ it is not
[6:03] speaking about the flesh man Jesus is
[6:06] speaking about Jesus Christ
[6:08] the Christ here see because you'll see
[6:11] that he creates all things in the flesh
[6:13] didn't create all things you know uh you
[6:16] know so we we see what it's going to
[6:18] verse 13 who who hath delivered us from
[6:22] the power of Darkness
[6:24] and have translated us into the kingdom
[6:26] of his dear son in whom we have
[6:28] Redemption through his blood even the
[6:30] Forgiveness of sins
[6:32] who is the image what exact likeness or
[6:35] exact person right it was the image of
[6:39] the invisible God the firstborn of ever
[6:41] a creature now watch that the first born
[6:44] of ever creature
[6:47] now remember that when we get back to
[6:49] our thought in a minute for by him were
[6:52] all things created that are in heaven
[6:54] that are in Earth visible and invisible
[6:56] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[6:59] principalities or Powers all things were
[7:02] created by Him
[7:04] and for him and he is before all things
[7:07] and by him all things
[7:10] consist all right so we know now this as
[7:14] I said that's not talking about
[7:16] the flesh man Jesus
[7:18] that's talking about the Christ
[7:20] amen the Christ is the Creator God right
[7:23] so now we go to Genesis
[7:26] 1 26.
[7:29] and God said let us make man in our
[7:31] image after our likeness and let them
[7:33] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[7:35] and over the fall of the air and over
[7:37] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[7:40] over ever creeping thing that creep puts
[7:43] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[7:46] own image in the image of God created he
[7:48] him male and female created he them
[7:52] let's read the next verse we generally
[7:54] just read those two and God blessed them
[7:57] and God said unto them be fruitful
[8:00] and multiply and replenish the Earth and
[8:03] subdue it and have dominion over the
[8:05] fish of the sea and over the father of
[8:07] the earth and over every living thing
[8:09] that moveth upon the Earth you may be
[8:12] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[8:14] reading of the word
[8:15] now
[8:17] in case I forget it going on through the
[8:19] message
[8:20] uh
[8:22] as I said we a lot of times we don't use
[8:24] verse 28.
[8:27] but read it as what it's saying and he
[8:30] blessed them and said unto them
[8:34] be fruitful
[8:36] and multiply
[8:38] now that's not a physical multiplication
[8:44] that comes on over after you bring the
[8:46] body into being and they were told to
[8:48] multiply and replenish this is not a
[8:51] physical creation there it is a
[8:53] spiritual creation and you know we'll
[8:56] get to that point as we get along and to
[8:59] see now
[9:01] to try not to back up too far but I've
[9:04] been on this a while of trying to get
[9:06] you to see and we went through uh Sunday
[9:09] morning there on Christ the ministry of
[9:11] God's reveal how that wrote around said
[9:13] God had a plan and a purpose that it was
[9:16] going to achieve to see his attributes
[9:18] displayed and he said and we see how
[9:20] this unfolded itself down unto this
[9:23] present hour that we are living
[9:26] all right so then it's being revealed or
[9:29] made known down to where we are
[9:32] we're not in the day of the revealing of
[9:35] the just shall live by faith
[9:36] we're not in the days or the revealing
[9:39] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[9:40] came on Azusa Street
[9:42] we're in the day of the revealing of the
[9:45] entire word of God to the Bride of Jesus
[9:48] Christ to bring her to a change of the
[9:52] body to bring her to completion or
[9:54] finish
[9:55] to make it all to be known unto us in
[9:58] this day and I remember I had mentioned
[10:01] this
[10:02] in a few things when you think about it
[10:05] God's first creation is always his
[10:08] example creation
[10:12] and see each creation
[10:15] Begins full grown
[10:19] now don't get on over in and try to run
[10:22] with your mind and think and we'll get
[10:25] to those things later on to New Birth
[10:26] and all but think about it
[10:30] that Adam
[10:32] and eve were a grown man and a grown
[10:34] woman
[10:35] all right
[10:38] then think of the church on the day of
[10:40] Pentecost
[10:41] was a full-grown Church
[10:43] all it was missing was a headstone
[10:46] well that was because it was not a day
[10:48] of it so we're supposed to be coming as
[10:50] we'll get to in a minute and the prophet
[10:53] will be talking about it and he's
[10:55] talking about this of what we're the
[10:57] creation
[10:58] and he says that that's why the whole
[11:01] world is groaning waiting for the
[11:03] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[11:05] of God
[11:06] see
[11:07] for this day
[11:09] to where the people of this day would
[11:11] get the revelation
[11:12] of the word
[11:15] of the hour that we're living
[11:17] all right to some people they are just
[11:20] hearing the message of the just shall
[11:22] live by faith some people are hearing
[11:24] sanctification some people are hearing
[11:26] the preaching of the gifts you know all
[11:29] right some people are hearing that God
[11:32] sent a prophet
[11:34] well all that's well and good and we we
[11:36] believe that
[11:38] we're not in the days of just even as to
[11:41] God sent a prophet
[11:42] we're in a day when the prophet said
[11:44] recognizing your day
[11:47] in its message
[11:49] Luther recognized his day
[11:53] and was not afraid of the world and
[11:55] confounded the world with his message
[11:58] Wesley took that and went on the Azusa
[12:00] Street gifts the prophet has had his day
[12:03] and time but it's up to you and I now to
[12:06] to get into the word for our day
[12:09] and I laid it out as perfectly as I
[12:11] could see because some people are just
[12:13] hearing the message here to be able to
[12:15] get this so I'm hearing it to get this
[12:17] someone yearning to get this but some
[12:19] are hearing it in its point of to bring
[12:22] forth in the end time all right now
[12:27] so then he begins ever creation
[12:30] with a full grown
[12:34] right now we spent a whole message or
[12:35] more trying to express how that we read
[12:40] of the or we read in Revelations 3 14
[12:44] the beginning of the creation of God
[12:46] but you've got beginning and creation
[12:49] both in the same sentence
[12:51] but neither one of those are implying a
[12:55] uh part of like starting something
[13:00] it's explaining
[13:02] the revealing
[13:06] like in the beginning was the word
[13:09] what does that mean in the beginning was
[13:11] that time that it wasn't the word no it
[13:14] always was the word
[13:16] all right
[13:18] so then the word beginning and the word
[13:20] Creation in scriptural terminologies is
[13:23] not speaking about uh just the beginning
[13:26] of something and well it started right
[13:28] here now that started or exactly on you
[13:31] know something like that
[13:32] no
[13:34] it's meaning something being revealed or
[13:37] made known
[13:39] coming into being that can be
[13:42] comprehended
[13:45] because the great Eternal never had a
[13:47] beginning right
[13:48] right well yeah we'll read in just a
[13:50] second
[13:51] the quote where Wade was there on Sunday
[13:53] that
[13:54] God is his first creation
[13:57] well was there a time there was no God
[13:59] and then he created his own self and he
[14:01] brought that's pollywogs and and all of
[14:04] these Darwin's and garbage cans
[14:09] because that's mentality of man trying
[14:11] to figure out by words
[14:14] think about what's being said
[14:19] see there was a time
[14:21] if you and I were not
[14:23] did not have eternal life
[14:26] we had to receive a new birth
[14:29] but yet when we received that new birth
[14:32] that eternal life
[14:34] always was eternal
[14:38] so what was it doing the birth brought
[14:40] you an eye to a position that natural
[14:44] life could not bring
[14:46] amen it brought us to eternal life
[14:50] and in understanding then we can see
[14:52] what's going on
[14:54] all right so now remember creation and
[14:57] beginning
[14:59] it's not a starting point
[15:02] of anything as much as it is to see
[15:06] something as it begins to unfold
[15:11] the man
[15:12] you know like I was bringing out Wade
[15:15] was bringing it out you know television
[15:17] was in Genesis
[15:21] where'd it come from if it wouldn't
[15:23] but where was it it was in components in
[15:26] the Earth
[15:27] right right the automobile was in the
[15:29] Earth where did it come from did it come
[15:31] to the Moon Mars or somewhere no it came
[15:34] from the Earth
[15:35] it was already there it just wasn't
[15:37] brought together in the form that it
[15:40] could be comprehended or usable right
[15:45] thing now is to that place all right
[15:49] now we've been studying then
[15:52] the point I wanted for the last couple
[15:54] of messages
[15:56] is
[15:59] if we can follow
[16:01] as God unveils something not they well
[16:04] he begin this no just get that out of
[16:06] your mind
[16:07] and get to thinking
[16:10] what I want you to think about is the
[16:12] time that
[16:13] there was no comprehension of God
[16:15] because there was nobody there to
[16:18] comprehend him
[16:20] you know that would be sensible
[16:22] well yet even you and I
[16:25] as we came along in our life
[16:28] and and we begin to comprehend
[16:31] a little bit
[16:33] God opens the eyes of our understanding
[16:36] and we begin to read the word and now we
[16:39] can see things a whole lot more clearer
[16:42] right
[16:43] than what we used to see
[16:45] why because it's unfolding or unveiling
[16:47] or being revealed
[16:50] being made known whatever thoughts you
[16:53] would be running it all right and I made
[16:56] this statement that I want you to stay
[16:57] with me tonight on
[17:00] is that
[17:03] the condescending are coming forth of
[17:06] God
[17:09] he comes from the great eternal
[17:11] self-existing
[17:14] he begins to
[17:16] come downward because he knows we can't
[17:18] understand that
[17:20] how can you understand self-existing the
[17:23] only way you can understand understand
[17:24] self-existing is to become self-existing
[17:28] right
[17:31] I mean you know I don't understand how
[17:34] the uh TV works I don't understand how
[17:37] telephones work that I can call
[17:39] you know India right now and talk to a
[17:41] person I don't understand that
[17:44] you say well that's all in them well all
[17:47] right that's your brain
[17:49] but there was a time none of that was
[17:50] capable of being understood I like to
[17:53] read in the little paper we get at home
[17:56] it gives what happened on this date you
[18:00] know back in time
[18:01] and uh you know it'll tell you that
[18:04] so-and-so was here that says Einstein uh
[18:08] got to Patton on this or Edison or
[18:11] whatever you know
[18:13] I like to read those things because I
[18:15] see then that that we have advanced
[18:18] greatly in our understanding
[18:21] but what would even
[18:23] um uh
[18:25] the great minds
[18:27] Einstein
[18:31] would he be able to comprehend the
[18:33] things that man is doing now
[18:38] is so far Advanced Beyond his day
[18:42] until now if he'd have studied with it
[18:44] and come up with it yeah but get my
[18:46] point
[18:47] all right so then let's see if we can
[18:50] watch God as he condescends down
[18:53] and bringing himself from one form to
[18:56] another form to another form as coming
[18:59] down
[19:01] and not be a different God
[19:06] you know
[19:08] how many in what little bit we've talked
[19:11] of in the first few Services how many
[19:13] gods would you have to have to to
[19:15] fulfill all of them
[19:18] but since the same God
[19:24] all right when we get to it in a minute
[19:26] where it looks like a child playing
[19:27] before the father's door
[19:30] just remember that's just a way of
[19:31] expressing it that's God in another form
[19:35] that's a way of explaining things to our
[19:38] human terminologies
[19:40] all right
[19:42] but as we watch the coming forth of God
[19:45] we can get an idea of how that we came
[19:49] forth amen
[19:55] because remember now that's what my
[19:56] point was
[19:58] it's got to be a full-grown man
[20:02] Adam with no baby
[20:04] and growed up
[20:07] you see man is still arguing over where
[20:09] God created eggs or created chickens
[20:14] you know
[20:17] he created male and female
[20:19] he made chickens he didn't make eggs but
[20:23] see we want to well you don't know
[20:26] no and you never will
[20:28] is yourself
[20:30] so just think about it now
[20:34] the way that God will come into being to
[20:37] be able to understand him
[20:40] you know comprehend him and he can
[20:42] reveal himself
[20:44] will be the same way that you and I come
[20:46] into being
[20:53] now if you don't get enough write that
[20:55] down and study over it think on it
[20:58] I'm trying to get us to look at if we
[21:01] can see how we come into being we can
[21:03] see how he come into being and we see
[21:05] how he come into being we see how we
[21:07] come in to be
[21:09] all right because it's not the Journey
[21:12] of you and I
[21:14] it is not you and I coming into being
[21:21] now preached to you long enough to ought
[21:24] to be able to comprehend that statement
[21:25] it's not you and I this is not the
[21:28] condescending of man
[21:30] this is the condescending of God
[21:35] to bring forth his offspring
[21:39] to bring his children into being
[21:41] right and his children are a part of him
[21:47] we've been through it and through it
[21:50] we're not something he created
[21:53] when you're talking about eternal life
[21:55] as the bride of Christ
[21:58] he didn't create us
[22:02] he just brought us into being
[22:08] right but the way we come has to come
[22:10] down through creations and birth and
[22:12] things in a new birth to be able to
[22:15] receive eternal life
[22:19] but think about it now
[22:22] to try to follow
[22:26] God in his condescending
[22:29] we can get an understanding of how we we
[22:31] came into being
[22:35] all right
[22:36] then we'd be able to look backward
[22:39] and see
[22:41] you know
[22:43] how it is all right we don't believe in
[22:46] many gods
[22:48] we believe in one true and living God
[22:51] all right
[22:52] we believe God has many manifestations
[22:56] father son Holy Ghost
[23:01] he has many attributes about him
[23:05] healer
[23:06] deliverer savior
[23:11] but it's the same person amen
[23:14] amen see that's where your your
[23:15] organizational things is no it's got to
[23:18] be God in three persons Blessed Trinity
[23:20] that's not even in the Bible
[23:23] but yeah that's what man has been taught
[23:25] and they'll kill you for believing the
[23:28] truth
[23:30] you say oh no they won't well they're
[23:31] doing it
[23:34] and they sure have done it
[23:38] all right
[23:41] now then in doing that then
[23:44] our main thought is
[23:47] to see God
[23:50] unveiling himself
[23:55] to be able to work you and I can
[23:58] comprehend him
[24:02] and he done it in a way that
[24:05] is so marvelous
[24:10] to reveal himself to mankind
[24:15] and in doing it then we know the word
[24:17] amorphy
[24:19] comes into view
[24:21] that is used by the prophet Allah it
[24:23] means
[24:24] change in form
[24:27] we read our in Colossians were that he
[24:30] was
[24:31] in the form
[24:33] the image
[24:36] form the
[24:38] not another God
[24:40] all right when we read about
[24:44] the child outside the father's door
[24:47] creating the world
[24:50] that's not a second person
[24:55] see we'll agree that he never sent a son
[24:58] to die
[25:01] for you and I he came himself right
[25:04] because we wouldn't do that
[25:08] all right we we follow that line
[25:13] and to think about it
[25:15] and see that doesn't make Oneness out of
[25:18] it then
[25:19] because you've got many forms
[25:24] that he reveals himself
[25:27] a Oneness is just like
[25:30] you know father son Holy Ghost whatever
[25:35] but they can't see that what I've tried
[25:38] to get you and I to see that the bride
[25:40] is the final in morphe amen for the
[25:44] Gentile dispensation
[25:45] now the Jews get nerves they're going to
[25:47] the white Throne you've got many forms
[25:49] for him to be displayed
[25:53] but in the Gentile dispensation where
[25:55] you and I are at
[25:57] you and I are that final form because
[25:59] God is not here in a Corporal body right
[26:02] he's in our bodies
[26:04] he has a body to live in that's inside
[26:06] of you and I he doesn't need a body on
[26:09] Earth
[26:10] at this time we meet that body in the
[26:14] air
[26:16] all right
[26:18] then thinking about that it's the same
[26:21] God
[26:24] all the time
[26:27] you hear the prophet of God's make a
[26:28] statement like this he said the same God
[26:31] that walked ashore to Galilee is right
[26:34] here tonight
[26:35] he's not talking about the flesh is he
[26:39] said the same God that created the world
[26:42] is standing right here tonight
[26:47] one because it's God in another form
[26:49] amen
[26:52] so you just changes his form because the
[26:54] word amorphy comes from the stage act to
[26:57] where one person can play many different
[26:59] parts
[27:01] but remember when it's all in finality
[27:03] it's just one person
[27:05] they might play a lot of different parts
[27:07] but it's the same person right right so
[27:10] when I get that in your mind about God
[27:12] and think about it because we're going
[27:14] to try to comprehend you know and I'm
[27:17] sure it won't get through tonight but
[27:19] follow the thought of God
[27:22] making himself known
[27:30] and he does that by his creation
[27:36] because the Bible says that even the
[27:38] Eternal godhead
[27:41] can be understood by the things that we
[27:44] see
[27:47] I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human being
[27:51] pastor of Church former General Motors
[27:54] employee
[27:55] what what else you want to put on that
[27:57] but how many people are they
[27:59] it's just one person
[28:02] so it could be understood by the things
[28:04] we see
[28:06] Robert said I can take a blade of Grace
[28:08] and preach for how many years did he say
[28:10] one time
[28:12] 20 years I think what he said preach off
[28:14] of a blade of Christ
[28:17] no
[28:19] see it's unveiling that God
[28:22] there is a message titled the unveiling
[28:24] of God we'll quote some out of that and
[28:27] then you've got the Mighty God unveiled
[28:31] because you see in the unviolent of God
[28:33] he carries it from God over into the
[28:36] bride but then when you get to the
[28:38] Mighty God unveiled
[28:40] he's dealing with the revealing of the
[28:42] Bride of Jesus Christ
[28:45] and he says in her then dwells the
[28:47] fullness or the godhead bodily
[28:49] and if you read about two verses down
[28:51] from where we read during Colossians
[28:52] that's what it says about this Christ
[28:55] because the Bible said in Christ
[28:59] dwelt the fullness
[29:01] all right so now follow the point as we
[29:04] try to read a little bit and just get
[29:07] the thought
[29:09] God had a hidden Mystery
[29:13] that he was going to reveal
[29:16] in this mystery is only to be revealed
[29:19] in this day
[29:20] after the opening of The Seven Seals
[29:24] all right to bring into view the
[29:25] complete Plan of Redemption
[29:27] so all right go ahead now brother these
[29:30] brothers had had these notes and we've
[29:31] juggled them like crazy man because uh
[29:34] we've added to and everything else but
[29:38] they've had these same notes and some of
[29:39] you didn't get a full notes tonight that
[29:42] try to read you just got a couple of
[29:44] additions because you're supposed to get
[29:45] what you had
[29:47] all right then that way you know you I
[29:49] wouldn't throw them away
[29:51] if you look down through there and see
[29:52] some it ain't finished
[29:54] I'd wait I might might try to finish boy
[29:56] it was number two brother
[29:58] Joe and her brother Anderson
[30:01] and the point I want you to see is
[30:04] is just what I've said to you now watch
[30:06] him who is this male chedded dick priest
[30:09] 1965-220 when the evening paragraph 40
[30:12] and that's what God did it's the same
[30:15] God all the time
[30:17] God in the form of the father
[30:19] the spirit the pillar of fire the same
[30:22] God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in
[30:25] morphe brought out so he could be seen
[30:28] all right now and now that same God is
[30:31] the Holy Ghost
[30:33] father son Holy Ghost not three gods
[30:37] three offices three acts of the one God
[30:40] all right
[30:43] so not nail that down in your thoughts
[30:45] now go on to the to a because these are
[30:47] some we had to add to
[30:50] this is all for the unveiling of God
[30:52] preaching 64 614 paragraph 77 and 78.
[30:57] and when he said there he emptied
[30:59] himself
[31:00] are poured out
[31:02] now we would think like this
[31:04] that he vomit up see that's what the
[31:07] English word would mean like pour out
[31:08] would mean like vomoc up
[31:11] you know come out something come out of
[31:13] you different from what you are huh
[31:15] that's the English word of emptied or
[31:18] poured out from him see something went
[31:20] out of him that was different from him
[31:22] but the word kinos in the Greek does not
[31:25] mean that he vomited up or some his arm
[31:29] went off his eye went out another person
[31:31] it doesn't mean that right
[31:35] see our English words would carry us to
[31:37] another person or another but kinos
[31:41] cares you to the point of not even an
[31:43] arm going out
[31:46] you know an eye going out or even
[31:48] another person it doesn't apply to it
[31:51] that is he changed himself
[31:54] he poured himself into amen into another
[31:58] mask into another form
[32:01] not another person went out of him
[32:03] called the Holy Spirit but it was he
[32:06] himself you get it congregation says
[32:09] amen
[32:12] he himself poured himself into the
[32:14] people now that's bringing right on down
[32:16] to where we're at right
[32:18] Christ in you how beautiful how
[32:20] wonderful to thank God pouring himself
[32:22] into the human being and to the believer
[32:25] pour out it was a part of his drama to
[32:29] do so
[32:31] God all the fullness all that God had
[32:33] bodily was in this person
[32:35] Jesus Christ it was God and God Alone
[32:38] not a third person or a second person or
[32:41] a first person
[32:43] but the person God failed in human flesh
[32:47] all right God condescending
[32:51] to Veil himself
[32:54] into human flesh
[32:57] okay
[32:58] as I said if we'll watch the way he
[33:00] comes down to human flesh
[33:04] we can follow the way we come down
[33:08] and I'm going to say this
[33:12] so write it down here in your thoughts
[33:15] we are not dealing tonight with just all
[33:18] man we're going to only deal with coming
[33:21] to Adam
[33:24] has everybody got that locked in your
[33:26] mind so don't go running it on over into
[33:29] we'll get to those things as we come to
[33:32] it we're only going to bring it down to
[33:34] Adam
[33:36] because Adam
[33:38] was given eternal life
[33:41] but you and I wasn't born with eternal
[33:44] life that's right
[33:48] all right
[33:51] but what we're going to see is how did
[33:54] that man of Genesis 1 26 and 27
[33:59] how did he come into being
[34:04] and that's not all man
[34:09] go to all man was not created in the
[34:11] image of God
[34:17] okay
[34:20] so we come into the full grown man Adam
[34:22] is where we're going to now so don't try
[34:24] to push it on over we'll get to those
[34:26] things as we go along
[34:34] so let us think about it
[34:38] let's read a portion of a quote Wade
[34:40] read there
[34:41] uh
[34:42] Sunday evening so go ahead with 2B
[34:46] which is questions and answers on
[34:48] Genesis preaching 53 7 25
[34:52] . you can come all the way down this is
[34:54] what Wade was dealing with Spirit man
[34:57] and all like that fishes and everything
[34:59] we'll get back to that on the other
[35:01] quote so that's fine this is the part I
[35:04] want you to think of
[35:06] he wasn't
[35:07] in other words Adam
[35:10] the first man in the lower creations of
[35:13] God
[35:14] Adam was the first physical
[35:18] human being
[35:21] right
[35:22] physical
[35:24] that's Genesis 2 when we get down to it
[35:27] all right
[35:30] the first creation was God himself
[35:36] now Theologian read that
[35:38] and his mind goes blank
[35:41] God created God
[35:45] that little wig and Remus healed and
[35:47] went to school
[35:50] you want to know better than that
[35:53] God created God
[35:57] that's not what he said
[36:00] see that's what your mind is saying
[36:03] because your mind is saying or starting
[36:05] a doing a being
[36:08] one creating another
[36:13] huh
[36:15] that's not what he's talking about
[36:19] in the condescending of God
[36:25] he comes forth in the understanding
[36:28] of
[36:30] Elohim
[36:33] that's the only words they can go back
[36:35] with because that word literally means
[36:38] self-existing
[36:44] so what else could a man with his human
[36:46] brain try to comprehend
[36:49] as the great Eternal God begins to
[36:51] condescend downward
[36:57] he said if I step over in other words
[36:59] listen to me
[37:01] here is a gap
[37:04] here's the Eternal God
[37:06] existing alone
[37:11] he says if I move downward
[37:14] toward that man that I'll eventually
[37:17] make
[37:18] I must first
[37:20] give him some understanding
[37:24] that he'll be able to comprehend me
[37:28] so it wasn't this God creating this God
[37:33] watch in a minute when we get to the
[37:35] fact the father sitting up here on the
[37:37] throne a son goes out in front and
[37:40] begins to say Let There Be
[37:42] not two gods
[37:46] well if you want to burn one down here
[37:48] well all right go ahead
[37:51] beat your brains out trying to figure it
[37:53] out
[37:54] because you will
[37:58] but yet when a prophet is saying
[38:01] the first creation was God himself
[38:06] the first part or understanding
[38:10] are comprehension
[38:14] of an eternal God
[38:18] would
[38:19] look like that he did create
[38:23] something
[38:25] because here's where that I differ with
[38:27] the people of this message
[38:29] you've seen those beautiful things where
[38:31] the brothers got these lights and he
[38:33] puts them up here a lot of you seen them
[38:35] and gloried about it until you heard a
[38:38] truth
[38:39] here's the he's got this and it comes up
[38:42] and he got a big old light and then he
[38:44] moves that over to here and then he
[38:47] moves that over to here and he moves
[38:49] that on over to here
[38:50] and everybody shouted have you seen that
[38:55] I did
[38:59] I did because that's not the way I
[39:01] believe God
[39:07] say we do have a separation online
[39:12] say we do have a self-existing
[39:16] I don't believe he would like the wind
[39:17] just floating around
[39:20] he's just a spirit
[39:22] he don't need anything the Bible says
[39:24] Heaven's my Throne personal footstool
[39:27] what else will you build me
[39:31] right
[39:34] I don't need your hours as he said
[39:37] I'm just going to do that so I can make
[39:38] myself known
[39:40] do you understand what I'm getting at
[39:45] it's something coming forth
[39:48] into
[39:50] an ability to put a word
[39:55] as something to understand
[39:58] because you see this is the way I
[40:00] believe it and you you think about the
[40:03] way that that brother draw them
[40:04] beautiful drawings of this Halo and all
[40:07] of this and put it over here and over
[40:08] here
[40:09] he didn't realize what he was doing
[40:14] I want to quote a quote to you that you
[40:16] hear it very very often of the prophet
[40:19] all God was he poured into Christ
[40:22] oh Christ he pours into the church
[40:33] and that's exactly right
[40:36] but what is your concept of that thought
[40:41] oh what do you mean
[40:43] but just all God was he went into Christ
[40:45] well then you ain't got no God
[40:50] you've done moved it all over here
[40:54] right I said where the man brought it
[40:58] then you said well all Christ in the
[41:00] church well then you ain't got no Christ
[41:02] left
[41:03] oh you got as a church
[41:06] you've just done away with Christ you've
[41:09] just done away with God
[41:11] and sister Gail it just leaves you
[41:16] I don't believe that
[41:19] I'm totally opposite to all of that
[41:21] thinking always have been
[41:24] I love the way the brother Mo explained
[41:26] it years ago when he was talking about
[41:29] the expanding of God
[41:32] he said you take an apple you cut it up
[41:34] you give out to pieces you run out of
[41:35] apple
[41:38] I don't believe it that way
[41:40] I believe the more that God gives away
[41:43] the greater he gets
[41:46] now you tell me any other way to believe
[41:48] in God than that
[41:51] so then all God was
[41:54] just change a form and make a Christ
[42:00] leave God
[42:03] is where he is
[42:07] well I thought we believed the Bible
[42:13] the Bible said that he asked the devil
[42:15] one day
[42:16] where have you been
[42:22] he said I've been going to and for on
[42:23] the Earth
[42:26] whoa
[42:30] what was he doing
[42:33] I've been going to and from the earth
[42:35] I've been out there deceiving the people
[42:38] who was he talking to
[42:42] the bride or Christ or God
[42:49] I like to make you think
[42:52] why because thinking in at least
[42:56] increases the brain
[43:00] and that way you won't have Alzheimer's
[43:05] he might get Old-Timers but not
[43:07] Alzheimer's
[43:09] more you exercise that brain the better
[43:12] it works
[43:14] don't worry about using it it's not like
[43:17] a car that after a while it just wires
[43:20] out you know
[43:22] do you understand what I'm saying
[43:26] God the great eternal
[43:29] did everything come down this way and
[43:32] leave nothing up there
[43:35] that's what we think
[43:39] I don't think that way
[43:41] I think everything is still there
[43:45] in another form move down here
[43:47] to be the Christ to create all things
[43:54] and then
[43:56] Christ is still here the Holy Ghost is
[43:58] still here the Christ the almighty God
[44:02] but yet that Christ come on to death
[44:04] Pentecost in the form of the baptism of
[44:06] the Holy Ghost an end to every believer
[44:08] down Through the Ages by the new birth
[44:12] that increases God
[44:21] see you race out well ain't no more god
[44:24] well ain't the more Christ well ain't no
[44:28] you're right where the devil wants you
[44:33] the devil wants you to believe you are
[44:36] God
[44:40] is that the scripture
[44:42] he said I'll be like God but then in the
[44:44] last days he becomes God to the people
[44:49] all right
[44:52] you see why I love the godhead so much
[44:54] it's beautiful
[44:55] if you keep in the right order
[44:58] but if you don't you're just going to go
[45:00] Haywire trying to figure it all out
[45:04] so then all God was when he pours it
[45:07] into Christ doesn't do away with God
[45:11] and it don't you don't have to move it
[45:12] over into so that's what we want we we
[45:15] want to keep moving something
[45:17] why not just think it's the way God's
[45:19] doing things
[45:22] he's unveiling himself
[45:25] so the prophet said it's the same God
[45:27] all the time
[45:31] and then we read here that
[45:33] that man in the lower creation of God in
[45:36] other words when he began to physically
[45:37] create
[45:41] to the first creation
[45:44] was God himself
[45:48] that wasn't one person creating another
[45:51] person we just got through reading that
[45:54] there's no first person second person
[45:56] third person he is the person the only
[46:00] person
[46:01] right
[46:03] but that's a beautiful drawing
[46:10] my Lord what do you want a beautiful
[46:11] drawing
[46:16] what a man said to me one time when a
[46:18] guy he hit all these trumpets brought
[46:20] out now I said brother that ain't
[46:21] easy for all
[46:23] the way you got it drunk the man drawn
[46:25] it he said that's a beautiful drawing
[46:28] and then my Lord man what's the drawing
[46:33] you know that a picture is worth
[46:36] a thousand words
[46:40] and you know that they started the way
[46:41] they got the Trinity concept into
[46:44] people's mind
[46:46] you know how it was
[46:49] they made a drawing of Jesus
[46:52] and they put a halo over his head
[46:56] they made a drawing of a great God
[46:58] before then
[47:01] and then and then they wound up the
[47:03] Catholics did and they they made a Mary
[47:07] with a halo over her head and she's
[47:09] holding a little boy with a halo over
[47:11] his head see that started putting that
[47:14] into our minds
[47:17] it's got to be a trinity I've seen the
[47:19] picture
[47:22] what's the picture got to do about the
[47:23] word of God
[47:29] pictures are great things but if they're
[47:31] not according to the truth what good are
[47:33] they
[47:35] but listen what he says
[47:37] the first creation was God himself
[47:41] then out of God
[47:44] came to logos
[47:47] watch him
[47:48] which was the son of God
[47:53] this is back before this is the coming
[47:56] down to the creation of
[47:58] and nothing is existing there
[48:01] at that time
[48:08] come on
[48:13] so then out of God came the logos which
[48:16] was the son of God
[48:17] then out of the logos which was the word
[48:20] now watch him in the beginning was the
[48:22] word and the words with God and the Word
[48:23] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[48:26] dwelt Among Us
[48:27] out of the logos came forth the the man
[48:31] now
[48:34] out of the logos
[48:37] and he said the logos is the son of God
[48:42] so I ask you the question I did 30 years
[48:45] ago and hurt some people's feelings
[48:49] I'm sorry but
[48:50] it made you think it's okay
[48:54] I asked Dan I said when you say son of
[48:56] God what do you think of they said 2 000
[48:58] years ago
[49:04] I said even the theologians got a better
[49:06] Revelation than that
[49:09] go to Rich Schofield
[49:12] you guys go feel Bibles read to Genesis
[49:14] accountants go feel
[49:16] and once you're talking about the logos
[49:18] the theophany the son of God
[49:24] no it's not
[49:26] we done been through that message right
[49:29] we don't believe in eternal sonship
[49:33] we believe that g Ives Jesus Christ was
[49:36] God made manifest
[49:39] in another form
[49:43] called the son of God
[49:47] and as I always say then Nebuchadnezzar
[49:50] looks down he sees for those three in
[49:53] and supposed to be killed he sees four
[49:55] the next day
[49:59] he said we throw it in three now there's
[50:00] four and he said the other one must have
[50:02] he's in the form of the son of God
[50:06] he knew that whoever was in there would
[50:08] have to be God and he knew if he could
[50:11] see it he'd have to be called a son
[50:14] because it's no other terminologies
[50:19] it wouldn't vipers and ideas and talks
[50:24] all right
[50:28] so then God was his first creation
[50:32] he stepped from where that he could not
[50:34] be comprehended
[50:37] he started condescending
[50:39] and he stepped down
[50:42] in a condescending that's the only words
[50:44] I can use
[50:46] and it does then the the spiritual eye
[50:50] of understanding can begin to pick up
[50:56] that whatever is fixing to happen
[51:00] is the same God
[51:03] that's going to do it
[51:08] that's why it doesn't say Jesus created
[51:09] all time read John 1 Colossians 1
[51:12] Hebrews 1 in James 3 and 9 or whatever
[51:16] all things were created by Jesus Christ
[51:20] he's the only Creator that's where you
[51:23] theologians they can't follow that they
[51:25] just go Haywire why because they got two
[51:27] or three people well they got a father
[51:28] over here and a son over here Holy Ghost
[51:30] over here
[51:32] now if you just believe it's the same
[51:34] one true and living God
[51:36] he just stepped down
[51:40] and he just begins to keep stepping down
[51:42] to where we can understand him
[51:47] now
[51:48] your kids
[51:52] you love Grandma and Grandpa don't you
[51:58] you love Mom and Daddy you love Grandma
[51:59] and Grandpa extra stepping down lower
[52:04] but those things about Mom and Daddy you
[52:06] don't understand when you're a little
[52:08] kid
[52:10] right
[52:13] you don't understand when Daddy says but
[52:16] I'm going to whip you because
[52:20] you certainly don't like none of the
[52:22] terms
[52:23] but when you get on up a little older
[52:26] and you look back
[52:28] you say well I wish Daddy would have
[52:30] whooped me three or four more times I
[52:31] might not have got into the trouble I
[52:32] did
[52:35] see it's the condescending
[52:38] understanding we're talking about
[52:41] now
[52:42] so the first was
[52:45] God himself
[52:48] then out of God how could you say it any
[52:50] other way what how beautiful it is but
[52:52] how could you say it any other way
[52:55] and out of God came to logos
[52:58] which was the son of God
[53:02] that's what he just said
[53:06] no it's not God the son
[53:09] that's God in another form called logos
[53:14] we'll get to it in a minute theophany
[53:17] Spirit Holy Spirit
[53:23] God unveiling himself
[53:27] and see out of the I know God came to
[53:29] the logos which was the son of God then
[53:31] out of the logos
[53:35] which was
[53:37] the word
[53:40] now you got word logos Son of God
[53:43] already
[53:45] covered in one piece of a sentence
[53:49] he goes to John 1 in the beginning was
[53:51] the word and words with God
[53:52] and the Word was God
[53:55] now that word with
[53:56] in John 1.
[53:59] I showed you theologians Haywire because
[54:01] the word with seems to signify
[54:04] two people
[54:07] right
[54:11] but now we've just got
[54:13] let's see we've just got God himself
[54:16] logos
[54:18] Son of God
[54:21] word
[54:25] is all referring to the same person
[54:34] see we want to use terminologies and we
[54:37] say well the word with means with
[54:39] somebody
[54:40] well when you get over to Genesis 1 26
[54:43] you really do go eight-wire God has said
[54:45] let us
[54:47] make man
[54:54] one of these days ago you think this is
[54:56] a crazy statement but one of these days
[54:58] I'm going to do a series on the godhead
[55:02] he said you've been preached it 40 years
[55:04] that's right just now getting enough
[55:06] knowledge to preach on it
[55:10] because you see I don't have any problem
[55:14] with looking and seeing God and seeing
[55:17] Christ and logos and seeing bride
[55:21] I don't have any trouble
[55:25] right
[55:27] I just now beginning to understand
[55:31] look what he goes on to number three now
[55:32] let's just read a little we just have to
[55:34] go so far and then we'll quit remember
[55:36] what we're doing tonight you run it back
[55:38] up to where you was and you'll write
[55:41] down below the first creation no
[55:44] right here is where this one
[55:46] stop right there
[55:48] paragraph 21 go down yeah take on 21. 21
[55:52] is between there but that's that's
[55:54] paragraph 21.
[55:56] all right
[55:59] oh I got a beautiful picture this is
[56:02] taken from questions and answers on
[56:04] Genesis 53 729 paragraph 23. all right
[56:09] see right in here would be your
[56:11] questions and answers right all right
[56:13] well I got a beautiful picture in my
[56:15] mind now if you could take a little trip
[56:17] with me I believe I've talked on it
[56:19] before but to get this place to work get
[56:22] to the place where you'll be sure to see
[56:24] it and let's take a little trip and go
[56:26] back for a little while
[56:28] and don't think about it how hot it is
[56:33] let's get our minds right on what we're
[56:35] going to talk about and think now let's
[56:39] go back a hundred million years
[56:42] before there was a star
[56:45] moon or anything in the world
[56:49] now there was a time when there wasn't
[56:51] nothing here
[56:53] it was just all forever in eternity
[56:57] and all of every eternity with God he
[57:00] was there
[57:02] in the beginning
[57:04] now think about it
[57:06] a beautiful picture
[57:08] to look at things
[57:10] all right
[57:19] go on to number four
[57:23] who is God
[57:25] priest in 1958 18.
[57:31] this will be
[57:34] two to read 16 17. all right
[57:38] so he first was god Jehovah and out of
[57:41] him let's just picture now as a little
[57:42] drama so you can get it let's see coming
[57:45] out of space where there's nothing
[57:48] let's make it a little white light
[57:51] like a Mystic light like a Halo
[57:54] that was the logos that went out of God
[57:57] in the beginning
[57:59] that was the son of God that came out of
[58:02] the bosom of the father
[58:06] not another God not another person the
[58:09] same God
[58:12] in another form
[58:15] that was what was that was
[58:17] that was what was in the beginning was
[58:21] the word
[58:22] and the Word was with God and the Word
[58:24] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[58:26] dwelt Among Us in the beginning was God
[58:29] and then out of God came the logos part
[58:33] of God that went
[58:35] out of God
[58:37] a part of God
[58:40] that went out of God
[58:44] it went on down to e17. and in the direc
[58:47] this is just like a child playing before
[58:49] the door it was the Son of God the Lord
[58:52] gosh and I can see him out there and
[58:54] he's fake and said let there be light
[58:57] and there was nothing but there was
[58:59] something happened and an atom turned
[59:01] there and began to whirl around this way
[59:04] the sun began to come into existence
[59:06] because he said let there be
[59:09] there's the author Authority excuse me
[59:13] where where did he make it from I don't
[59:16] know there was nothing to make it from
[59:20] him but he believed his own word
[59:23] I love that
[59:25] he believed his own word and there was
[59:28] light I could see a peace flaw for that
[59:30] it's a media meteor after a few million
[59:33] years or 100 billions of years if you
[59:35] want to call it and it circled away out
[59:37] I see him standing out there watching
[59:39] him he falls down in here he stops it
[59:42] after it falls a few million years and
[59:45] let it hang there in orbit and here goes
[59:47] another one flying off the Sun
[59:50] and goes over here and hangs down and
[59:52] stops dar
[59:54] what's he doing
[59:58] he's creating
[1:00:01] the world and the things
[1:00:04] this word is logos
[1:00:08] this son of God
[1:00:13] I thought we believed
[1:00:16] by the new birth
[1:00:18] that we were The Offspring of God
[1:00:22] I thought we were believed we were the
[1:00:24] children of God
[1:00:27] I thought we believed we were Sons and
[1:00:29] Daughters of God
[1:00:34] now wait just a minute now you're
[1:00:36] getting too close because you're putting
[1:00:38] us back there
[1:00:41] I'm glad you thought of that
[1:00:46] if you haven't listened I'd advise you
[1:00:48] go back about four services and come
[1:00:50] back this way
[1:00:55] that Eternal logos
[1:00:59] Son of God
[1:01:01] was God in another form
[1:01:05] it was a bride
[1:01:07] back there with him
[1:01:11] if you wasn't there if I wasn't there
[1:01:13] when you created the world we'll never
[1:01:15] be there
[1:01:18] simple enough
[1:01:20] because that's the only way to have
[1:01:22] eternal life
[1:01:24] that's what I said watching him come
[1:01:25] down we see us come down
[1:01:27] we just got to make sure we get it right
[1:01:29] and make us come lost
[1:01:31] and got to be saved
[1:01:34] everybody else wants to bring us saved
[1:01:36] and don't need no Redeemer I don't agree
[1:01:38] with that
[1:01:41] man look at number five that he goes to
[1:01:43] a message
[1:01:45] on the cruelty of sin and the penalty of
[1:01:47] what it costs to read sin out of our
[1:01:49] Lives I think 53 403
[1:01:54] paragraph 48 will go through 51. and
[1:01:59] or two okay
[1:02:02] then he said after he had got all of
[1:02:04] that made
[1:02:06] before he'd ever done anything else I
[1:02:08] can see this little Halo move over over
[1:02:11] this world which was merely a cinder
[1:02:13] Frozen hanging out there
[1:02:15] like a great Iceberg now the message
[1:02:17] before see it's the way I try to put
[1:02:19] them together
[1:02:20] to make it we were talking about that
[1:02:23] light and the creation now he's telling
[1:02:26] you what it looks like
[1:02:28] bring another message and just take what
[1:02:30] it looks like
[1:02:32] and I could see this little Halo move
[1:02:33] over in this world which was merely a
[1:02:36] cluster a cinder Frozen excuse me
[1:02:38] hanging out there
[1:02:40] like a great Iceberg and he moved it
[1:02:43] over near the Sun and he began to turn
[1:02:46] it like that around the Sun it began to
[1:02:49] melt and the big ice glaciers tore loose
[1:02:52] Texas was being formed
[1:02:55] you don't know how this United States
[1:02:56] got all these mountains and valleys and
[1:02:58] Grand Canyons and things like that they
[1:03:01] I never was convinced that the Grand
[1:03:04] Canyon which is five miles deep got that
[1:03:07] wave called water running down through
[1:03:09] there
[1:03:09] if you do that's all right
[1:03:12] I believe right here is where it
[1:03:14] happened
[1:03:15] Texas was being formed me
[1:03:21] and the planes there
[1:03:23] as we're talking now the icebergs come
[1:03:25] down through there
[1:03:26] breast chronology just configure out and
[1:03:30] then the whole world after it run down
[1:03:33] into the Gulf of Mexico and so forth
[1:03:36] begin to beam up with water in the world
[1:03:39] without form and void
[1:03:42] and we're in Genesis 1.
[1:03:45] see now then God moved and separated the
[1:03:48] firmness from the waters and he made
[1:03:50] Delights
[1:03:52] and then he created all the creation
[1:03:53] then after he made it all the trees come
[1:03:56] up the plants and so forth what a
[1:03:58] beautiful setup he had he loved it it
[1:04:00] was beautiful and he thought that was
[1:04:02] fine
[1:04:03] watch
[1:04:05] so we couldn't just leave it in that
[1:04:07] state
[1:04:10] he had to leave something with it
[1:04:13] so he said
[1:04:15] let us plural
[1:04:18] make man plural
[1:04:19] in our own image
[1:04:22] let us make man in our own image and
[1:04:24] soon so when God made his first man
[1:04:28] he was a spirit man
[1:04:34] he was something on the order of God or
[1:04:37] the Son of God now that's not Adam and
[1:04:39] flesh
[1:04:40] we'll get to it a little bit adamant
[1:04:42] flesh is like an animal like a dog cat
[1:04:44] in a bar
[1:04:46] this is a special creation
[1:04:49] he was something on the order of God or
[1:04:51] the Son of God the logos
[1:04:55] that was the first man
[1:04:59] yeah
[1:05:01] he has no trouble here bringing a man
[1:05:07] and speaking of a man
[1:05:09] and him being in the image of God
[1:05:17] we shouldn't have any trouble with it
[1:05:19] but we should get it right Spirit man
[1:05:22] logos Son of God
[1:05:26] first man
[1:05:28] first man was not a physical creation
[1:05:36] First Man was created before the world
[1:05:43] the flesh Man was created in Genesis
[1:05:47] 1 25 4 25.
[1:05:51] on the sixth day
[1:05:56] Man was created on the sixth day right
[1:06:00] he said well wait a minute is Genesis 2
[1:06:02] 4 it's great it wasn't Genesis 2 when
[1:06:04] he's created it's Genesis 2 that records
[1:06:07] his creation
[1:06:11] come on
[1:06:13] Spirit man comes
[1:06:16] first
[1:06:20] then the physical man comes in Genesis
[1:06:23] 125 or whatever it is the sixth day
[1:06:28] God never created anything after
[1:06:31] the sixth day
[1:06:37] okay
[1:06:39] he rested the servant I thought we
[1:06:41] believe the scripture
[1:06:46] so then the physical man comes in
[1:06:48] Genesis 1 24 25 right in there
[1:06:52] a spiritual man was already before the
[1:06:54] world began
[1:06:58] he said well this is just in the mind of
[1:07:00] God
[1:07:05] I'd go back about four services and
[1:07:07] start listening
[1:07:10] we've done back there and found out
[1:07:13] that eternal life you have wouldn't just
[1:07:16] in the mind of God
[1:07:19] that eternal life you have today by the
[1:07:22] new birth was a part of God when he was
[1:07:25] self-existing
[1:07:31] he's laying down a few things
[1:07:34] one of these days I want to start
[1:07:35] preaching
[1:07:37] I gotta slow down
[1:07:44] watch what happened with this man this
[1:07:47] son of God this logos this Spirit man
[1:07:52] that was the first man
[1:07:54] and he gave the man jurisdiction
[1:07:57] over to lead all the animals life
[1:08:01] just like the Holy Spirit leads the
[1:08:03] Believers today
[1:08:05] go here do this
[1:08:09] now if we were perfect in submission to
[1:08:12] the Holy Spirit God would lead us by the
[1:08:14] Holy Spirit just like Adam led the
[1:08:16] animals
[1:08:18] Adam had control of the animals
[1:08:20] physically once he got created
[1:08:23] but how come he had it
[1:08:25] why did he have control of the animals
[1:08:29] because that logos theophany Son of God
[1:08:34] already had control of the animals
[1:08:39] before he was put in physical
[1:08:42] contact
[1:08:46] I'll just say if you want me to
[1:08:48] if it not have been this first man
[1:08:50] created spiritual then the
[1:08:53] lines would have ate the second man
[1:08:55] immediately
[1:08:58] I don't know what I said silly okay
[1:09:00] that's silly
[1:09:03] so then he made them
[1:09:06] then when he began to move he began to
[1:09:08] move upon upon the idea then that
[1:09:10] it made Man Out of the Dust of the Earth
[1:09:14] there was no man until the soul no one
[1:09:16] to do work no physical being so he made
[1:09:18] Man Out of the Dust of the Earth right
[1:09:20] he made two
[1:09:24] men in Genesis
[1:09:26] spiritual man then physical man
[1:09:33] now just think
[1:09:39] well let's go down and just read this
[1:09:41] part says the man came from a different
[1:09:43] life and and we say then when we look at
[1:09:46] her man here he's in the image of God
[1:09:48] and watch
[1:09:50] this is was not the image of God to
[1:09:53] begin with
[1:09:55] this is not it
[1:09:58] this was the image of animal life
[1:10:02] evolutionists arguing he said I don't
[1:10:05] believe in the chain of evolution the
[1:10:06] way they do
[1:10:07] all come in a single cell but I believe
[1:10:09] we he evoluted certainly
[1:10:13] he's not talking about Evolution the
[1:10:15] evolution of one band from another
[1:10:17] but then when God made all of that
[1:10:20] and got put the man in the
[1:10:23] made him out of the Dust of the Earth
[1:10:32] and what did he do
[1:10:35] made him out of the Dust of the Earth
[1:10:39] and not in his own image
[1:10:42] that's physical right
[1:10:44] he'd already made the man
[1:10:47] spiritual image
[1:10:49] then he breathed into him the Breath of
[1:10:52] Life
[1:10:54] and he became a living soul
[1:10:58] the soul of man is the nature of the
[1:10:59] spirit and when you're reborn you don't
[1:11:01] get a new spirit you get a new nature of
[1:11:04] that spirit it's the same spirit with a
[1:11:06] new nature of it
[1:11:08] all right now
[1:11:11] if I go any further I've got to go into
[1:11:12] some thoughts so what I want to do for
[1:11:15] just a moment
[1:11:24] I want to stop and then we'll come back
[1:11:26] to here
[1:11:27] Sunday
[1:11:30] but I want you to think about what has
[1:11:31] been said
[1:11:36] God was made first
[1:11:39] not made
[1:11:42] he changed his form that could be
[1:11:44] comprehended
[1:11:46] are you following me
[1:11:49] when he said first creation was God
[1:11:52] himself that doesn't mean that there was
[1:11:54] a time he didn't exist and then he did
[1:12:00] I've preached to you what 40 years and
[1:12:02] all the attributes of God was in God
[1:12:04] before he ever started anything
[1:12:08] he didn't develop attributes coming this
[1:12:10] way
[1:12:11] they were already in him
[1:12:16] where'd he get him from he didn't
[1:12:19] but as I was illustrating from a line to
[1:12:21] where you can comprehend nothing and all
[1:12:24] at once something happens
[1:12:28] and you begin to get an idea
[1:12:33] these movie versions today are beautiful
[1:12:36] I mean in doing things
[1:12:38] because they can take something that and
[1:12:41] and take a picture of something
[1:12:44] and they could make me standing right
[1:12:46] here
[1:12:47] in front of the pulpit
[1:12:50] and that could make me just totally
[1:12:52] disappear
[1:12:55] you know trick photographies Etc
[1:12:59] and then they could bring me into being
[1:13:01] gradually
[1:13:04] gradually
[1:13:06] coming into being
[1:13:09] and in all at once you say well hey
[1:13:10] that's that's brother Dale standing in
[1:13:12] front of the pulpit
[1:13:14] why because your understanding has been
[1:13:17] opened
[1:13:20] that's what I'm trying to get you to see
[1:13:24] God began to take the veil off the
[1:13:29] of himself to where he could make
[1:13:31] himself known
[1:13:34] the first creation was God himself next
[1:13:37] was logos
[1:13:39] Son of God
[1:13:47] and he begins to create
[1:13:50] who begins to create
[1:13:52] the Christ the logos
[1:13:57] the Son of God then John 1 1 is right
[1:14:00] that he's the Creator about verse three
[1:14:03] Colossians is right that we read
[1:14:07] Hebrews is right
[1:14:10] God in 200 times the government needs
[1:14:12] goes right on down to the and then I
[1:14:14] believe it's James 3 and 9 where it said
[1:14:16] all things were created by Jesus Christ
[1:14:22] he brought himself downward
[1:14:27] and as he did the wording then comes
[1:14:29] like it said about Nebuchadnezzar could
[1:14:31] look down there and see I know
[1:14:36] that if I can see it
[1:14:39] it's got a form
[1:14:42] and if it's in there
[1:14:44] and it killed them guys that put them in
[1:14:46] there why did it not burn him out of the
[1:14:49] tree
[1:14:50] he said there's got to be the son of God
[1:15:00] see then that way you're looking at God
[1:15:03] unveiling himself
[1:15:07] to bring himself into being that could
[1:15:09] be comprehended
[1:15:14] and then we look back and
[1:15:17] see him because
[1:15:19] I said if I go any further I'm going
[1:15:20] into Jesus and the soul and think
[1:15:23] right around said it was the soul of God
[1:15:25] that went to hell to pay the price for
[1:15:28] me and you
[1:15:29] he said his soul his Spirit his
[1:15:31] theophany of his being
[1:15:36] went to hell
[1:15:38] physical body didn't go to hell
[1:15:41] but to God that was in that body
[1:15:45] went to hell
[1:15:50] the one that began to drop downward
[1:15:54] it's not another God
[1:15:57] it's just God changing his form
[1:16:01] he's walking downward
[1:16:03] until he comes to Genesis
[1:16:06] every time you get to Genesis you've
[1:16:08] already got theophany word logos spirit
[1:16:13] Son of God
[1:16:17] before you even start
[1:16:20] the physical creation
[1:16:22] you've already got him unveiling himself
[1:16:24] in many forms
[1:16:28] to make himself known
[1:16:35] but if we can see that then we can watch
[1:16:37] and see how Adam came in to be
[1:16:42] because Adam was called a son of God
[1:16:52] see then as I said we're not talking
[1:16:54] about physical natural man you're
[1:16:56] talking about
[1:16:57] Spirit man logos theophany
[1:17:02] I don't want to make a couple of quotes
[1:17:03] to you before we close and let you think
[1:17:06] about it
[1:17:10] I told you
[1:17:13] there of Genesis 1 28.
[1:17:16] that we don't read a lot
[1:17:20] but this spiritual man
[1:17:22] that was put over the garden
[1:17:25] to lead the animals
[1:17:33] he was male and female
[1:17:38] and it was called them
[1:17:45] right
[1:17:48] let them have dominion
[1:17:50] over the fish of the
[1:17:53] I told you then you come on over later
[1:17:55] now you get on over about three or four
[1:17:57] and you pick up where they were told to
[1:18:00] multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:18:04] but you see Adam when he was in a
[1:18:06] spiritual being
[1:18:11] was told to multiply and replenish
[1:18:16] and brother Gary let's just put it out
[1:18:18] here this way
[1:18:20] everything that was needed to bring
[1:18:22] forth
[1:18:24] the rest of the creation of God
[1:18:28] was in Adam and Eve
[1:18:33] in their spiritual creation
[1:18:39] I'm not talking about physical doings
[1:18:41] right now come on
[1:18:49] it's like I told some of them the other
[1:18:50] day evidently God knew what was going to
[1:18:52] take place in the garden on that message
[1:18:54] that he knew we'd fall
[1:18:56] I made the point
[1:18:59] Adam and Eve had all the parts to bring
[1:19:02] forth human beings
[1:19:04] he must have known they were going to
[1:19:06] fall and then to be used because he knew
[1:19:09] they wasn't going to
[1:19:11] bring forth without the fall
[1:19:19] he didn't have to create Adam and Eve
[1:19:21] parts for them to multiply
[1:19:24] but I want you to look at this scripture
[1:19:29] wrote a randomized reading it the other
[1:19:30] day and I was reading I thought he said
[1:19:32] we read 126-27 but said let's read one
[1:19:34] let's read 128.
[1:19:40] told a multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:19:49] the word replenish doesn't mean this
[1:19:52] plenty twice it's been finished and
[1:19:54] replenished that's not what it's talking
[1:19:56] about
[1:19:58] it's to bring forth into being
[1:20:05] and you've got to admit had there been
[1:20:07] no fall Adam and Eve would have been
[1:20:09] instrumental in bringing forth
[1:20:14] I'm not talking about a body to live in
[1:20:17] now
[1:20:18] I'm talking about the spiritual creation
[1:20:23] you see we want to make a such a narrow
[1:20:25] thing or make her a
[1:20:29] big old hamburger and us me and a big
[1:20:31] old porterhouse steak
[1:20:33] you see why I'm against all of that
[1:20:35] stuff
[1:20:36] I know who calls to fall but I know Adam
[1:20:39] lost the whole human race
[1:20:42] because the Bible says in Adam all die
[1:20:45] he had a choice as Wade was bringing out
[1:20:49] he had a choice and he took his choice
[1:20:53] and brought to fall
[1:20:55] we want to lay everything under the
[1:20:56] woman try to blame her
[1:20:58] thinking we can skip our way into
[1:21:00] Heavens by some of our Beauties or
[1:21:02] something
[1:21:03] you know with people
[1:21:09] no
[1:21:11] no
[1:21:14] you try to blame for somebody else for
[1:21:15] what your problem are you know who your
[1:21:17] problem is you me me you we are a
[1:21:20] problem it's not somebody else
[1:21:25] but just think a second
[1:21:28] they were told in a spiritual creation
[1:21:32] to multiply and replenish
[1:21:38] now may I quote brother Branham
[1:21:40] how are we supposed to come brother
[1:21:43] Branham
[1:21:48] he said the seed comes through the body
[1:21:52] you go with that one
[1:21:56] seed comes through the body
[1:22:00] we were to supposed to come by spiritual
[1:22:03] multiplication
[1:22:10] that is the only way we can come forth
[1:22:13] now
[1:22:13] is by spiritual multiplication
[1:22:21] whenever that see that's where you get
[1:22:23] you don't stay with me
[1:22:27] I said don't run off onto Natural Things
[1:22:29] yet we are still on the spiritual don't
[1:22:33] get concerned about what Adam and Eve
[1:22:35] should have done or would have done had
[1:22:36] it done could have done or what have
[1:22:37] done
[1:22:42] they done what they've done
[1:22:45] there's no argument to the point
[1:22:49] and it would not have been that we would
[1:22:51] have come forth without the fall
[1:22:55] there's no argument to the point
[1:23:00] but the point is
[1:23:03] if we take it correctly
[1:23:07] preacher standing in the Pulpit breaking
[1:23:09] the word of God down to the people a
[1:23:11] spiritual multiplication
[1:23:13] you sisters talking to your neighbors
[1:23:16] Brothers
[1:23:17] and you talking to them because you're
[1:23:20] part of the body of Christ
[1:23:22] you talking to your neighbor you talking
[1:23:24] to the people
[1:23:25] that's spiritual multiplication
[1:23:30] have we forgotten the whole thing
[1:23:34] that was in our spiritual
[1:23:37] creation
[1:23:42] brother random said and we'll bring us
[1:23:43] out Sunday
[1:23:45] that Eve was in Adam
[1:23:47] in theophany
[1:23:56] okay
[1:24:00] you see I'm trying to get the Plan of
[1:24:01] Redemption to us
[1:24:04] amen you say well you've got to share a
[1:24:06] funny way of doing it I agree
[1:24:11] but we've got to realize we lost poor
[1:24:14] can be saved
[1:24:18] if we come to the realization that we're
[1:24:20] lost
[1:24:25] and now I'm going to say this and you
[1:24:27] can just think what you want to
[1:24:28] and if somebody don't stir or
[1:24:32] understanding of some way
[1:24:35] to make us to
[1:24:37] begin to pray and searched God
[1:24:44] then the biggest portion of people are
[1:24:46] not going to get it
[1:24:48] would you agree
[1:24:51] see that's all I'm trying to do
[1:24:54] stir you up
[1:24:55] to get you to pray and read your Bible
[1:24:58] and read the prophet's message and
[1:25:00] listen to the tapes sometimes
[1:25:09] and in doing that
[1:25:11] I've become an intellect
[1:25:14] a smart alec know it all
[1:25:19] all kind of things have been tacked on
[1:25:21] people don't want to hear me
[1:25:23] but you know what I can't have that
[1:25:25] I don't have any problems with it
[1:25:32] my problem's just sitting right here
[1:25:34] with them facing is me and you is the
[1:25:37] ones I'm trying to get converted
[1:25:40] I'm not responsible for the rest of the
[1:25:43] world
[1:25:43] anything on the internet out there is on
[1:25:45] their own choices it's not for me
[1:25:52] but do you see what I'm talking about
[1:25:55] the title we use the title
[1:25:57] the two services
[1:26:00] the beginning of the Christian God
[1:26:04] now tonight and one more at least will
[1:26:07] be the beginning of the creation of God
[1:26:08] and of
[1:26:11] man
[1:26:15] because the same way God comes is the
[1:26:17] same way the man's coming
[1:26:22] so if you can get it either way if you
[1:26:23] can get the way that I'm talking about
[1:26:25] it that's the way I got saved you can
[1:26:26] say well that's the way God comes
[1:26:29] back on these things come on brothers
[1:26:34] about 10 minutes till nine we'll quit
[1:26:38] Brothers still got a lot of quotes on
[1:26:41] Sunday
[1:26:43] but listen Church
[1:26:45] I'm just trying to get you and I to see
[1:26:50] Who We Are
[1:26:52] how we got to be Who We Are
[1:26:57] and where we're headed
[1:27:06] but I pray that the things that I've
[1:27:08] said has not been something to hurt
[1:27:10] people's feelings because it's like what
[1:27:12] I said about the man that had the
[1:27:13] beautiful drawings maybe I shouldn't
[1:27:15] have said that but
[1:27:17] I just seen so many people I sat with a
[1:27:19] man and just
[1:27:21] he told us it just get that drawing and
[1:27:23] look at the way
[1:27:24] and I thought oh God
[1:27:28] just walk away
[1:27:30] I told God if I open my mouth
[1:27:33] I'm going to say something
[1:27:35] but it's helped me to be quiet and walk
[1:27:37] away
[1:27:41] because if you take all that and put it
[1:27:44] over here you've got nothing up there
[1:27:47] you take all that and put it here you
[1:27:49] got nothing there you've only got
[1:27:52] the bride of Christ
[1:27:55] and that's Satan's Doctrine
[1:27:57] is to get to people to believe that they
[1:28:00] are God
[1:28:02] because you see Church
[1:28:04] there'll never be a time
[1:28:06] but you and I won't be able to see who
[1:28:08] he is
[1:28:10] we get over there on the other side I
[1:28:12] believe we'll see the physical
[1:28:15] Corporal Eternal Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:19] you don't want to make the body standing
[1:28:21] there
[1:28:23] amen and I believe we'll comprehend
[1:28:27] but you know it won't do away with this
[1:28:29] or do away with that or well the
[1:28:30] father's not here so we raise him out
[1:28:33] you know and we we don't need the Holy
[1:28:35] Ghost no more we race that out
[1:28:44] you get there you'll realize their
[1:28:46] stands father son Holy Ghost right in
[1:28:49] front of me
[1:28:55] let's stand
[1:28:57] 201
[1:28:59] anybody have a need
[1:29:13] in his hands
[1:29:30] to sing
[1:29:34] I'd rather wear my voice
[1:29:39] understand
[1:30:04] see if that God still lives
[1:30:07] we'll see if that God has condescended
[1:30:10] in your revelation
[1:30:20] only the bride
[1:30:23] is predestinated
[1:30:25] to say the truth in the end time
[1:30:33] only the bride is predestinated to see
[1:30:40] somebody gonna bring it that we can see
[1:30:43] it then
[1:30:48] he's got the whole
[1:30:56] singing unto him and think about it
[1:31:09] and Richard both have been real sick
[1:31:12] vomiting diarrhea
[1:31:15] this gets down to where you anything you
[1:31:18] eat go straight through you
[1:31:20] the lady took it had it Tuesday
[1:31:24] Wednesday Thursday or something
[1:31:27] last night she started again
[1:31:30] vomiting
[1:31:32] well let's just believe it'll be all
[1:31:34] right
[1:31:37] because everything will be okay
[1:31:40] I told them I believe in physical time I
[1:31:44] said go home get your clan of Lysol
[1:31:47] spray spray the whole cotton picking
[1:31:50] house
[1:31:53] change all the bad clothes wash them all
[1:31:57] but I believe in do it now
[1:32:01] and I believe in God
[1:32:04] taking care of it don't you father in
[1:32:09] the name of Jesus Christ we give Anna
[1:32:11] this prayer cloth get rid of all these
[1:32:14] germs these boats whatever that be that
[1:32:18] affected their in their home or the
[1:32:21] family and Richard and Anna and Abby
[1:32:24] Lord we just ask you
[1:32:27] to reach down and touch the home and
[1:32:29] cleanse it everything that the Demons of
[1:32:33] hell are trying to pervert and we ask
[1:32:36] you to just touch them physically Lord
[1:32:38] in their bodies to build up their immune
[1:32:41] system it all would be well we love you
[1:32:45] in Jesus name
[1:32:48] anybody else
[1:32:56] last year if you remember they had a
[1:32:58] real bad problem with the flu bugs and
[1:33:01] all head over there at Banks County
[1:33:02] school and
[1:33:04] and it was telling us today that
[1:33:07] yesterday I believe it was
[1:33:09] today
[1:33:10] they had more kids absent
[1:33:14] today from sickness than they had had in
[1:33:18] any other day last year with all of that
[1:33:21] sickness
[1:33:23] see it's just
[1:33:25] Satan's doing everything he can
[1:33:28] and I believe in a Healer I believe in a
[1:33:31] deliverer brother John Martin I remember
[1:33:33] him saying it one time
[1:33:34] he said
[1:33:36] why do we wait till we get sick to pray
[1:33:40] he said why don't we pray before we get
[1:33:43] sick
[1:33:45] you know
[1:33:47] won't you thank him every day for your
[1:33:48] health
[1:33:50] I mean thank you for your your health
[1:33:52] you said when he I I I'm hurt you don't
[1:33:55] understand that's what's the problem
[1:34:01] you're trying to deal on some form of a
[1:34:03] line to do
[1:34:05] mediators or something believe it
[1:34:09] and say buy Stripes I'm Healed
[1:34:11] what does it matter to me how sick I get
[1:34:13] what has that got to do with it
[1:34:16] he's the Healer
[1:34:21] he's a deliverer
[1:34:24] we try to believe it
[1:34:26] release our faith
[1:34:29] you know what every day we get older
[1:34:31] every day we get new pains
[1:34:34] well that old devil won't after me he's
[1:34:36] after everybody in the world
[1:34:41] it ain't just you he's after
[1:34:47] it's everybody
[1:34:49] we're living under a curse folks whether
[1:34:51] you like it or not
[1:34:54] but that don't mean I lay down so
[1:34:56] anybody knows that's been in this church
[1:34:58] for 10 years you know this man don't lay
[1:35:01] down
[1:35:05] I don't give up
[1:35:06] I fight
[1:35:08] physically or whatever
[1:35:11] in my body to try to keep it under
[1:35:13] control
[1:35:15] I refuse to let the devil put those
[1:35:17] thoughts in my mind
[1:35:23] I say buy Stripes I'm Healed
[1:35:26] how are you doing call me up how you
[1:35:29] doing doing wonderful

[1:36:24] we're the bride
[1:36:26] why don't we see more miracles Among Us
[1:36:32] you want to stay all night
[1:36:35] the prophet of God said that bride would
[1:36:37] be tried
