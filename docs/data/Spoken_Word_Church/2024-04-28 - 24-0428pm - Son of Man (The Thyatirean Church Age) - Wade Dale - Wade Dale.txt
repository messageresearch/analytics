Lord good to be back among you we've got uh had a good time this morning and we're looking for another good time this afternoon amen hear from the word of the lord we uh um thank you all for um the comments between service that sounds good I'm like brother brandham brother brandham said that man was lying when he said he didn't want somebody tell him he did a good job so um I'll just continue with that so if I can find my sermon I'll get started there we go all right so Lord bless you remember these announcements brother Donal will be with us this coming um Wednesday night and then uh Saturday will be Bible study and uh we will have uh questions and answers and I like I said I have a few questions so if you have any please let us know by then or before then would be better remember brother Luis is coming on coming back and I guess brother Aaron is too from where they are this weekend just remember them in prayer um also remember as I tried to if you can be here uh the weekend of Memorial Day we're going to have a a dedication or a ordination service actually and uh we'll be announcing that a little bit later on so uh let's bow our heads and pray Lord thank you so much for giving us a day to be able to stand here Lord and to speak to the people about you father that's a desire in our heart before we walk out of the out of the office there Lord is for you to speak through us and and Open the Eyes of our heart Lord and and Lord just be with us by Revelation many many things that that Satan can give us to impersonate but he can't give us a true Revelation from you so father we pray that we we receive today a true Revelation from you Lord and I pray for those that are sick Lord that you would give them a true Revelation that by your stripes they're already healed and that they'll claim that now in the name of the Lord Jesus just bless each one now in the furth of the service bless us in Jesus name amen God bless you love you with the love of the Lord so let's go to Revelations 1 we'll talk a little bit about the Beast again I want to bring something else in uh um on that but let's start with our regular scripture I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches thank God that he sent us a prophet that wrote a church AE book that explained these things to us and helped us to see these things that no one else and had only God knew who those seven stars were only God knew them man didn't know who they were man would have said maybe polycarp man would have said maybe probably this one or that one or or as we're going to see this afternoon St Patrick was was probably a more powerful Minister than Columba but God didn't pick St Patrick he picked St Columba for a certain reason and maybe we'll get that later on but maybe not today but thank God for a prophet that said this is it this is your pattern this is what to look for this is your pattern age this is your Alpha church this is your Omega Church they got to be the same and he just gives this a beautiful picture it takes away all the questions that we have sometimes all right and if you'll just let God speak he'll take your questions and he'll answer them I promise you all right so he sent him to the church ages I turned to see the voice that spake with me being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of those seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the PS with a golden girdle you may be seeing the Lord At His blessings to the reading of the word and then this morning and we'll read a little bit more Revelations 4 because we didn't really get to the other part of this we're going to see these four beasts they're going to come back again that they're going to be shown again in the Book of Revelations and we'll see it just in a few minutes so Revelations 4:6 say Before the Throne there was sea of glass like into the Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion second beast like a calf third Beast had the face of a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying e so this message comes it's unsealed it's opened up to a group of people they see it they receive the message and you know what they get sealed away just as a messenger gets sealed away so does the people brother brand when he was beyond a curtain of time he said oh are these all brandom they said no they're your your converts he didn't see Paul's he didn't see irenes he didn't see Martin he saw his these are your converts these are the ones that's going to be together with you this is in other words these are your responsibility this is who you brought out from the quickening power of the message I gave you William brandham or I'm giving you William brandham by the time he had this Vision it was 1960 he had even started his message yet really his true message he said these are your people and they're the ones that's coming in under you and you'll be responsible for them right and then he said well did Paul make it so that say that assumes we're just going to assume not good to assume sometimes but if he would have seen Paul in his group he wouldn't ask that question but he said did Paul make it angel said yes Paul made it he said well I'll make it too cuz I preach what Paul preached and remember everybody else was saying what we're resting on that all right we're resting they were resting on and there's people that are and what a paradox I was thinking the other day all these Messengers and I'm sure that was false we can't see that because we don't have we're not uh previe to the information of irenius and Lutheran and even uh the opposition there was opposition in every age but we're we're granted an opportunity to see the opposition of brother brandham see what they're saying about him and it's blasted all over the Internet and these preachers that are that are preaching 30 years in a in a a church and and people get born again listen it doesn't it doesn't require somebody to be in the PO pit for you to get born again right that Born Again experience comes from you now there has to be somebody somebody teach you but the requirement is that you receive it cuz brother R said you can take an egg and put it under a dog and it'll hatch because it comes under a right condition well those people that this Minister you know not too far from here he 30 years preaching and I'm sure he buried people in the name of the Lord Jesus he he married people in the name of the Lord Jesus people got born again in his service I'm sure they did because they've carried on but then he denies every bit of that well there's a lot of people over in that sixth Dimension that he put over there he ain't going to get credit for him though the credit's going to go to brother brandom cuz he if he denies it here hey he ain't going there I'm sorry you deny this message and you're not going over there right you may be going over there but it ain't over there in the sixth Dimension all right so we thank God that we're in a different situation where we can we can visualize and see and see what they're saying about and stay away from it all right some of the others like we're going to cover in Luther where we watched the movie where Luther uh where he leaves and then all of his uh young preachers are tearing churches down and burning them and throwing the priests out in the yard and and Luther was like what are you doing they said well we're doing what you said do see they got a wrong Revelation it was right it was Luther had the right motive and objective they just didn't have the right motive and objective all right and they took it wrong for him to literally them to literally tear the churches up Luther was doing it spiritually get away from this break away from that they're not preaching the right gospel in other words he may have preached one day and said tear them all down well he didn't really mean to go tear those buildings down but they did take what he said sometimes that's not too bad sometimes it is bad so the messenger picks up the the mind of God he brings the message to us it's a message that you are identified with all right now we're identified with all of them every message we're identified with because we know the part listen to me we know the parts in pieces amen cuz see Luther's peace was the just shall live by faith but Luther's peace was peace of his ministry was not to restore us back to the faith of the fathers everybody with me right right his message was that just shall live by faith come out of her my people that was it now he preached he stood and preached and preached the uh trinitarian doctrine that peace is not the peace we get right but we surely get the one that Su just shall live by faith and see what Luther did bringing and telling them come out get out you know I wrote no those Theses come out of that church and because that church is going to kill you and actually he was the one that really cuz he remember he got excommunicated by the Pope the pope had him come in one time and we'll look at in the history but he didn't recant he went right on it didn't bother him one bit when he got a revelation that the pope wasn't his God and when we get to Revelation that no man on this Earth Is Our God God is our God then I promise you you will not have an issue with backing up with nobody you'll know where that power see we think power sometimes times is it's like brother Ram said we're going to walk in and just as you walk in the um northe Georgia Medical Center and everybody's just going to get healed no no power is you living an everyday life and having overcoming power over the devil amen amen cuz listen we're all Sinners saved by grace that's right brother BR said we sin every day but we have an advocate we have somebody to go to like brother Bob said quickly we go and say God forgive me for what I just did God forgive me for what I just did but in your soul if you're born again it never was a sinner amen amen never sinned a day in his life what you got to do is is believe that that man is going to take control of your life yes that's what you got to believe that that man is stronger than any other spirit that you had before cuz praise the I just saw that praise the Lord every Spirit you had just become weak when the Holy Ghost come in you got to realize that though and use it in your everyday life don't if that thing pops up that is the weak part the one that's inside of you is the strong part am amen it's the strong man of the house the Bible says but when he's but when he's not in there right when the strong man's not in there then they can tear the place apart but you get the strong man in there and every listen the strongest demon you ever had in your life when you were out in the world and you put your exyz in it whatever you want to do your laundry list mine's different from yours maybe the same but not one of them is as strong as the Holy Ghost you got now not one not one of them hey let me give you another thing not any of them together come on is more powerful than the Holy Ghost you got inside of you none of you said boy I just had to drink I had to smoke I had to that's a weakness that's a weak demon when he stands in front of a powerful God that's what we got to see that that power is already inside of you as I was talking about those those four living creatures they're there for a purpose you might need a lion one day you might need to be bold but you might need to be an ox one day to bear with somebody help somebody bear their burden and then you got to have intelligence God give me this kind of knowledge give you this kind of knowledge not Street knowledge not knowledge book knowledge but the knowledge that this is right and everything else is wrong that God did send us a prophet God did send us a message and this message is Right amen that's knowledge and listen that's past seven no that's past 7.98 76 billion other people in this world on absolutely I said billion when you look at all over the world you this message is only probably not even a DOT on the end of the sentence amen really born again people is about that all you got the little dot on the end of a pen amen but you're part of it and it's the most powerful thing that ever come on the face of the earth except for Jesus Christ that's right every Church age had a flaw we have flaws but God take it God's taking our flaws and making them right yes I'm like the old preacher if I'm not doing it right just hang on a little while let's just keep working and then we'll get it right cuz this is right this is wrong but if this is in here come on this is right this becomes right we sin every we have B you just had a bad thought just now boy Jo only the honest one in the whole place he's like yeah I did you never had a preacher stand here and just run right down your aisle and split your head wide open and you said oh praise the Lord thank you maybe later you did but it's the time you're like well bless God that no be under's doing the same thing why a't you talking about them he is they know that but how do you handle it it's how you handle it it's how you handle it it's like somebody told Dad not too long well you know back when he was preaching said you stepped on my toes he said well move them move them you said him I said him preach all day about drinking alcohol I hope it's a waste of time in this building Hall I hope it's a waste of time in this building right so that's why we don't preach on that amen am but now in other churches they may have to do that but not I'm not talking about other denominational churches but not in a message Church you should not have to keep going now y'all got get out of them liquor stores you got the liquor store demon out of you that's what you should have done that's why this is not a rehab facility never has it been a rehab the true church has never been a rehab facility it's been a delivering facility it's been a changing facility it's been your Earth has been changed when you come into this facility I don't mean this building I'm talking about come into the true baptism of the Holy Ghost righten when I got to New Birth I'm telling you I did not want any of that um skull or long cut straight skull and smoke I never smoked but Donnie did some of you others had different things right but when the Holy Ghost burnt that out I sure now listen it's like dad said he never like drank beer in his life never liked it but as soon as he got born again that beer look pretty good you know why that demon is trying another angle I don't know why I'm getting off on this but I'm doing anyway it's another angle he takes right right well you never drank that before but you might if you took a little drink it might be pretty good huh the Devil is a worthy adversary absolutely so you be careful brother R said you are no match for the devil but take this guy right here put it right here in the heart of a Believer brother R said you do that you got deity speaking so the Bible the word of God is speaking through you listen for years it was speaking to you now let's get it where it's speaking through you sure we we we've absorbed years of Doctrine years of preaching probably thousands of sermons now let's start pushing it about the other out the other side start living it start making it work so the trumpet sounds a messages proclaimed well listen if there's a message should got to be somebody to listen to it and say as as hady R says that ain't nothing but the truth listen she meant it so much come on till God honored anything she said brother R said that sister would have got up out of the wheelchair she'd asked for a million dollars it have been on the table she could have asked whatever the Holy Ghost said you tell her ask whatever she wants and it changed the course of two sons lives right amen amen thank you Jesus and she probably had soap on her hands dishwashing detergent all over her hand sisters I'm going down your aisle right now probably had an apron on her hair was probably not all fixed up real nice she was serving the prophet dinner and heard him talking I don't think brother R was even talking to her but she said brother B that ain't nothing but the truth and what she done is she opened a portal from eternity to here just a little woman that says that a and she you know what though she believed it we can say it all we want to she believed it was a truth I mean that substance that brother rown was talking about became real because she said she said that ain't nothing but the truth it it broke the Airways there was a message and what did God do he turned around and gave whatever she needed that's what he gave to her in other words as we were we're going to talk about the seals he opened up the seals opening up the seals to a group of people in 1963 was I don't say useless but it was not useless it was supposed to been at their time but it helped nobody then I'm telling you what a prophet said he's gone from you not even for you not even for you right listen this is for you cuz I'm handing it to you okay give me that back give me a right but if it's not for you it's from somebody else see I give this to Michael cuz I said that's his but if I give it to him and brother Donnie's done drank out of it I'm sure he's not going to drink out of it but brother randam maybe you are you but brother randam was preaching to a group of people I know Daddy Fountain wouldn't make you sick make you sick just thinking about it we got to chew each other's chewing gun remember and not you first not you first but if it's not for you you're not going to get it that's but these things are for us these things are for us to grab a hold of and they're laying out there and sometimes we just keep them and let them lay there remember sitting on the premises Standing on the Promises let's just don't come in and sit on the premises on your premise and expect God to do something no that's right no so that message was proclaimed and it was distinct and declared just like the lonox man and the eagle there was there's an anointing God has what dispensations see the dispensation of the Holy Ghost in 1906 isusa Street was that the gifts were going to come back the Holy Ghost was going to fall on a group of people all right regardless if they were trinitarians regardless if they were uh baptized in the name of father son holy ghost that was the time everybody with me because it's going to be important that there was a time for every one of these things and everything had to line up and fit at the same time that's right and God's never been off he's always been on time that's right so he brings a message group of people's already there I believe right now there's 144,000 over there and those two prophets they just have not been anointed yet amen I believe that cuz it's that close they don't have to raise them for babies I believe they're over there now and getting ready but they can't do anything you you say well boy if they heard the message of the hour remember brother Brandon was going overseas he was going to Israel he said I'm going over there he said you bring them people think about a prophet he said you take them out on the plane in other words take them out there where Moses was and he said we'll see so you know what God let him do God let him get to Egypt he was getting his extra ticket to go to Israel and the Lord said if he had went over there it had broke scripture it had broke time element it would have broke everything in the Bible but you know what God did let him get to Egypt that's right he didn't tell him over in Jeffersonville no you don't need to do that no he let him think about it he looked and then when then when it was time he said he took me behind their hanger there and said hey not yet time man they would accepted that cuz see that's what they're looking for they're looking for Elijah and if they would have seen that and now I know that you know there was a message Church in Israel at one time but I think he's done quit the message right Solomon Jacob didn't mean to bring his name out but he preached here before one time he's not meant he denied the message you think he'd be over there in the right place that ain't the right place for a message believer to be hello somebody that's right I mean they can and they may have a church somewhere over there pretty close but that this message is not for them people at this moment that's right amen it's a time so then then God has a time he has a declared message it comes at a distinct time in the in the in the um economy of God cuz when we get out of here immediately when we get out of here God's going to open their eyes is he going to open a little bit I don't know those two prophets brother bam said a prophet was born a prophet but see they're anointed by the mees by the Moses and Elijah they're anointed by those two anointings so they got to wait till that comes several message Believers several years ago was like we need to go to Israel we need to get stay out of the place it's not us I'm sorry why don't you go on the street corner and do it here in America this is where the Gentiles need to be gleaned not over there in Israel there are going to be Jews that come in I guarantee you they will be but not like the 44,000 and it's not going to accelerate God's program he has a program we got to leave before they go over there that's it period God's waiting on us to get in line but he knows exactly when that's going to happen he's going to have them ready I was thinking going to Kentucky the other morning I was watching the traffic flow you know how we pray I hope you pray when you get behind the wheel of a car if you don't you need to start cuz you know what God may bump your head every once in a while and remind you that you need to pray before you I mean maybe bump your car I pray every time I get in the car to go on a trip and I pray on the way back home that God will make keep it safe do you know he can orchestrate every bit of those cars at one time absolutely there was thousands of people going through Nashville and I said Lord you are you got Angels orchestrating this whole thing so that nobody cuz you know what the devil want to do do he wants to kill you as soon as you walk out the door if y'all don't believe that or not there's a fight going on that you hadn't seen before that you probably would get scared to death if you did see it that as soon as you grab your door knob about 10,000 demons wake up that's right and they're not there for your health that's right they're there for your demise and without without god without God protecting us every day because listen we're that we're that kind of people that that that uh you take somebody like the FBI CIA you're on the radar and they watch every move you make them demons are the same way head demon he wants us all gone anyway he hates to feel what you and I have sure he can feel an anointing I'm talking about the power that's in this message the true word of God that he can't get come on people he can't get in there he can play everywhere else but he can't get inside of your soul if you're born again he can't tamper with the true word of God sure he try to make it false but the truth is always going to come out that's why you got an opposition a war a war is two opposing forces I've never seen anybody fight a war with both of them having the same agenda no it's two different agendas two different mindsets do different things that's why they're fighting and that was why I was going down the road you see all them cars and I'm like man devil I know you want to take two or three of them cars and just move them over this way and mash me and kill me and all that I said but greater is he that's in me and he that's in that demon right there that demon is just a little minion that does what head demon tells it to do and head demon don't do nothing tell the head God tells him what to do so he can't touch you that's you but you better pray when you drive when you see those thousands of cars and you see them moving I almost saw an accident almost hit a motorcycle but he was coming four lanes over and he got about right here but you see there something slowed you down something sped you up something moved you over absolutely you think boy I don't know you you're just too no listen the life of a Christian number one is a unique life and number two you don't see what goes on for God to keep you away from being killed every day every hour you say boy that was a close call that ain't luck none of it is you stop and thank God that he protected you through that accident or even if even if you do get in an accident well the great miracle you do get in an accident and they're like whoa you didn't even have a scratch well there was an angel there pushing the glass out of the way pushing the pushing the metal out of the way or or pushing whatever comes I don't know where this come from but it's something you need to do you need to thank God and be aware that we have Angels around us both good and bad both good and bad but the good will always overcome the Baden if we yield to the good and just forget the bad so The Messengers laid away and so are the people of that age they're laid away into the sixth Dimension the place of holding where they're there with their messenger I'm sure that whoever's always all gone before they're sitting around brother bradam and they're talking to him and and and conversing back and forth they're just not sitting there on the cloud he saw people running he saw people coming over the hill so it must be a little Hill over there in the sixth dimension how Vivid is it wasn't his imagination he saw it it was real that's a real place listen that's more real than this one yes it way more real than this place we're just in a place that we have this right here because we're slowed down to a point that that's hard but when we speed up that was another thing I was thinking I thought man all this stuff's coming through my car I'm picking up radio stations as I go there's different radio stations cuz one kind of fizzes out and the other one picks up right if y'all don't travel then that's exactly what happens okay same way with your cell phones used to you know you get to a place you went have on cell phone service like mazille Georgia they need a mayor but I'll talk to Richard but that's all going through your car every bit of that where's them voices coming from where's it singing coming from where's that preaching coming from it's the voice you're listening to right that's right it must have some kind of substance where's it coming from it's coming from a faster Dimension it's so fast it's coming through your closed window yes am I crazy here or what it's coming right through there so listen there is then some substance that you can be changed to yes that'll put you through a wall change in a moment the twinkling of an eye yes sir well I don't know where that come from either but let's go through here yes it is true and we need to be aware sufficiently impressed are aware that this whole thing is being orchestrated by God if you're a born again chrisan he's going to take care of his kids if you're not he's not obligated to he's only obligated to his own children that's right brother Dale said many years ago he said God's not going to adopt the devil kids no he's just not going to do that he'll adopt his kids but he's not going to adopt the devil's kids but when you become one of his you come under his adoption you come under the headship he's your head and man it just works out it just works out and I believe we're heading towards something that works out this Rapture is going to take place this body change is going to happen we're going to come to a place not that we not to sinless Perfection don't ever think that but in God's eyes we never sin a day in our life if you're born again and the filter of God from him to us there's that blood there's that blood that he shed at Calvary that brother R said he hears your voice through the blood but he said if he' see you every day in your everyday life he' have to kill you amen thank God for a prophet that tell us these things but you know what everything he says made sense everybody with me toight you listen to same Prophet I do everything he said made sense you're like why didn't I think of that well you're thinking of it now yes through the filter of the word of God through ministers through the five-fold ministry you're getting it I hope you're getting it I hope we're getting it I hope we're all getting that there's not yeah there is something great coming but there's something great here but if you don't realize it it's going to continue on and you're going to be left right here brother B said you you latter rain people they're looking for a latter rain they were over here in the rapturing part cuz latter rain is a harvest rain right he said you ain't even had to former rain yet cuz you know why he was the former Reign his preaching teaching was the former Reign but they thought they were already over here well you know who told them that some preacher did and they accepted it CU it sounded good and felt good but when brother M stood there and said that boy didn't it sting them it stung their uh idea and thought it stung them because they're like oh wait a minute we're over here brother said you Ain even had this yet that's why they rejected him that's why there's a spiritual war every time a preacher preaches there's a spiritual War cuz if he brings out something in our life come on that's a war it's to opposing things fighting each other let go and let God let go and let God yes sir take self out of the way get rid of oursel get rid of our thoughts and ideas amen and put it in the word of God that's the message of the hour you can take all the other things and the great doctrines which is fine but you will never understand these great doctrines without the Holy Ghost you'll never understand these great doctrines without the teaching of the message of the hour that's right won't happen and your results will always be wrong if you start wrong right you got to come to right somewhere wrong can't be right without something in between making it right cuz wrong stays wrong and right stays right but if you bring right in and you and you realize that and you taking in say God I'm sorry I I had a problem now I don't or I didn't understand this quote or I didn't understand this Doctrine or I didn't understand the scripture but now I understand it listen that's a powerful Revelation that's something the devil has never figured out come on somebody when you get a revelation that didn't come from the devil that come from God and Satan is absolutely sealed out of that thing he can't see it he's an unbeliever well he believes himself but he's an unbeliever we're going to skip all through this cuz I want to get to something now remember the messages that we saw we come to pergamus I want you to see this in pergamus so one more time that what happened the two churches are bearing the same name but with a bitter difference between them one has departed from the truth married idols and has no life in her we're talking about the paman church age because that's going to give birth to the th tyan Church age right everybody with me on that all right the Third Church age everything starts morphing in the other direction just as the IMM morphe of God is in um uh um columb or the one before Martin Satan is in morph too he's in morphed into a Roman Catholic Church he's in morphate into church and state putting them together and they got power now but the little church never had that the little church had the word of God and that little church was laid away see she has hybridized herself and the signs of death not life follow in her weight she's powerful many members favored by the world the other is a little persecuted group but she follows the word and the signs follow her the sick are healed the dead or raised she is alive with life and the word of God she loves not her life but holds to his name and his faith even unto death that was the pergan church age then you go we're going into the dark ages in just a few minutes and see just for a minute that Dark Ages it was a long time it took a long time to go through that to to weed all that out for Luther to step on the scene because remember Luther was part of that system Luther was part of that system that killed all those Christians he was a Catholic he had to get have a conversion so the for living creatures we were talking about this morning I think we kind of covered it pretty well but there's one thing I want you to see that I didn't cover two things I want you to see you remember from this this morning I hope you did that those living creatures are inside of you that's your everyday work life of of of being born again those are in your life and you know what you use them and you don't even know it you use them and you don't even know it okay but God knows it that's why I put them there if you had to sit there and figure out which one no you just use it use your Holy Ghost amen so there were four beasts full of eyes before behind now let's get to the Book of Revelations first was a lion the second was a calf third was man fourth one was an eagle is everybody with me on that all right they had wings and they were zoons and then you got the ones that are theion beast which is an untameable Beast now listen all of us were born a wild untamable beast but it took a the zoom it took a living creature to come in and clean all that out and then put the nature of God inside of you everybody with the nature let me say it one more time the nature of almighty God is inside of you at the new birth all right and listen weren't you dead in sin and trespass sir weren't you dead as a as a sinner you were born dead everybody with me you were dead without Christ you were you dead you were ding you going on but thank God he sent those he sent those combat Beast see because we're going to take them now remember they were four living creatures everybody with me all right wake up just a second the four living creatures all right now they come over here and watch in the Scripture it shows here it says that they were four beasts hold on Ezekiel said four living creatures you come over in Revelations you see beasts for Beast now hang on a minute everybody with me and where were they they were in the people all right four living same one same thing but watch the verbiage four living creatures he Ezekiel did not have the Holy Ghost to interpet what that was right right but John comes over here and watch what he does he looks and he sees two different powers so there's two different beasts in Revelations there's not one over here in Ezekiel it's all put together living creatures in symbols to help the people all right but you come over here and John's looking at and he says hey those are four beasts because hey guess what they're in opposition to these theion beasts cuz a beast Rises up from the United States a beast Rises up here and speaks and he ain't a good one right that's why the the people when they wrote the the in the Greek one's a theion beast and one's a zoon it says Beast better watch so we know where they're at now I got them kind of fixed where you can see them lonox man an eagle the lion was in what the first three Church ages the middle Church age was the ox we'll see that in just a minute and then the man anointing was the two men Luther and Wesley that came on the earth that had the intelligence to put it in Bible for him you I didn't know I was read been reading the um the history of this all these people that and not even just there's different people that we got a church AE messenger and brother B puts him up here there a lot of people down here that does a lot of work what it uh tendale William tendale put the Bible together you know they drug him through the street and killed him right for that not cuz they didn't like him and he had some bad dinner or something or he treated somebody wrong for him putting the Bible together and getting it printed they drug him through the street and killed him William tendel see you see all those that are martyred that that that that they're going to get a crown too but you don't hear from them much because they're not Church age Messengers but but thank God there's people working St Patrick St Patrick did a lot of work before even Columba comes in on the picture but but Columba comes in and sits down on top of what St Patrick did Brother Ram comes in and sits right there on top of all the other ones he talks about FF Bosworth all the different ones he names them all he never calls them that says they're Antichrist no dght Moody he said sent millions of souls to Heaven that's what he said Dwight Moody Dwight Moody was probably a trinitarian you see how God works though it's his sovereignty to work any way he wants to and bring his people in That's supposed to be brought in under their messenger that's why the brother R made that clear under under our messenger were the final voice of the final age cuz he was the final voice amen but under him we're the final voice to the F to the age everybody with me I'm going to say this and say this real quiet brother brandham was in the L in church age is everybody with me so are we but remember we called out of the age but remember there's a each Eternal age that we're heading to and we're farther over this way than he was everybody with me let me explain that he died 1965 obviously the Rapture is not taking place laid away we ain't gone farther than brother Brandon we just TimeWise have went further you hear me TimeWise why cuz there was no message churches in 1965 when he died half of his people that was that you hear on tape went back to denominations they had nowhere to go and I believe they had the Holy Ghost well don't get quiet but God has dispensations and I believe when brother brandham talked about 1977 that there was a dispensational change it wasn't that the Rapture was going to take place we missed what he said but that was a dispensational change now you and I are in the real Church age you and I are supposed to be in right and we're recipients of that and we have been for some 50 and 60 years we've been in that final voice to the final age cuz that voice didn't sound back in 47 I'm talking about this voice this voice that was a restoration voice this voice is a carrying out of here voice this is a rapturing faith voice this is a body chain voice this is a powerful voice that's going to get everybody out of the ground that's waiting on us so yes yes we went past the prophet but only in time right not in Revelation you will never go past brother Brown in Revelation we got to understand what he said already amen everybody all right with that but we're in the eagle anointing age I don't believe that eagle anointing was in 1962 3 and 4 if if it had been brother R said you're all getting what I'm saying man I y'all ain't got no problem you getting everything I'm saying no he stands up in 63 and questions and answers he said you're not getting it he said it's not for you he even said it's gone from you what did it do it sealed back up it sealed back up for that group of people but they were all born again that's like when we get over into the major doctrin you we talk about marriage and divorce and we may have to tie people down and keep him here but marriage and divorce is a sticky situation but brother Brown said this is to my followers only only don't try to tell somebody about marriage and divorce that Ain that's out in the world they look at you cross-side that's right you can't talk about denomination no but God had to give us a Grace yes he knew we'd be in the shape we're in he knew we were because of misinterpreted theology he knew that because when times pass we were in the the lust of the Flesh and did all that back in there but he gave a Grace thank you Lord so that there'd be enough people left to be able to preach the message and take a body change that's the grace that God give us through a prophet but it's to his followers only not to the whole world you can't just claim it that's greasy you got to really know it was for you claim it but don't ever do it again everybody with me all right so that's just kind of a little but it's but it's it's for here only it's for his followers that's what he said and you know what you know who he was talking to Sister CET were y'all there were you there a marriage and divorce yes okay I would I would I'm not going to assume sister CL was born again there was born again people in that building he wasn't talking to the barrooms he wasn't talking to a lot of Sinners they were a lot of people he said if he says this is to my people only they must have been message Believers at that point in time everybody with me you say no he's talking about Sinners they just living like dogs and he give them a Grace no these are born again people that had made a boo boo yes and was sitting in that congregation they made a mistake and he said go on as you are but don't ever do it again right that was a Grace for his people that was a Grace for people that had the Holy Ghost there's not Grace for people out there right it's God's grace they're still alive yeah but but but as far as marriage and divorce man you I mean even in a in a regular Church there's divorce counselors and there you know it's just just become so easy to get a drive-thru divorce till you know but we don't believe in that but we do believe in grace listen Paul gave a Grace let me tell you this way Paul gave a Grace to set everything back in order while he was there everybody with me remember the guy was married to his mother or his stepmother-in-law or step something you understand what I'm talking about if you look in Corinthians you'll see it and then he become on to be a good person over here a little bit later in second Corinthians you read what brother B says about him get straightened up he said but Paul had to give one to get everything you know what do you call it a kind of a checkup you know where you pull everything you check everything up then now from Paul to us though it got the Gap got wider misinterpreted theology comes in and makes that Gap wider but without a Grace over here listen without a Grace you wouldn't hear a lot of preaching I claimed the grace of marriage and divorce cuz I needed it and if you didn't then praise God you were married to the wrong person when you woke up out of your mama's womb so we all need that Grace all right but to make everything come back and to ratchet it back to to zero it had to be a Prophet come on the same Paul had to come in Jesus had to come in Moses had to come in and give a Grace so he come over here in the end time and it had got so far away till brother R had to stop say hey but he had to go up on a mountain he didn't just get it out of a book he went upon a mountain and God said okay tell them people we're going to have a marker right here and that marker is going to be right here and if you go past that marker again there ain't another Prophet going to come on the scene that's right and give you another Grace this is it that's why that's why he said I'm shaking what listen to the sermon he said I'm shaking he said my insides are shaking he said you don't know what this means he did but a lot of people didn't but he did he knew what that meant he was almost forgiving those people for what they' Done Right remember that woman said brother BR said said you you know you like God well brother B said honey read the Bible the Bible says who sins you remit they're remitted who sins remain they he C out of the Bible I don't know where that came from but let's get started here but there's a time that everything restitution there's a time of restitution for everything everything's got to come back to zero all right we got to make all wrongs right and try not to ever do it again oh no don't ever do it again all right so look now we've come to the children of Israel and back in Ezekiel you were talking about the living creatures and then Paul comes up I mean U John comes up and he sees two opposing forces he sees a beast over there and a beast over here four of them all right you know why because if you read book of Revelations we're going to read it here in just a second Revelation 6 verse1 says let's read it now that's where one of them comes up that I didn't show you this morning and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals oh this is coming to be a great time cuz the seals are fixing to be open they never been open before he didn't entrust it to nobody but one of those four beast and I heard it was the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see that's how important those beasts are right there was a beast in four openings of the seals there was four horse riders and you know how brother BR came to a revelation that the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal he said the combat beasts are gone come on the combat Beast are gone well if the combat Beast are gone then the Holy Ghost is lifted off the Earth and if it's inside of you it took you with it everybody with me on that so those beasts are important but that's not a theion beast that's a zoom that's a living creature everybody with me on that okay so remember what happened when John watching the Ark of the Covenant now remember when John sees a vision in in Revelations he don't see an ark he sees a throne everybody with me on this wake up for a minute he sees he sees a man sitting on the throne he doesn't see a wheel that's in ezekiel's time that's the four living creatures he can't name them all right he literally I don't think Ezekiel knew how that all fit together in that picture he didn't have a holy ghost He listen he was just truly a mouthpiece for God to drop down and speak through him and then remember what uh brother r or some preacher said that that Isaiah stood up and said preaching and he said a virgin shall conceive he said he probably went home and his wife was like what are you talking about where'd you get that from and he probably scratched his head why because the anointing came off of him he become a regular Man without that Revelation again everybody with me so that's the same way he works the same way now but see we now as John had the Holy Ghost Inside of us the ark is inside of us the ark's not rolling through the Wilderness it's walking into Walmart I don't know why we use Walmart so much he's walking into Target Aldi praise the Lord that's where we shop it's anointed it's got good prices too we found out these creatures were not angels all right we'll see watch brother Brown now John John tells you where they're at he's got the see in Revelations real quick he brings that scene out in Revelations one sitting on the throne he's got the the four Beast around it he's got the 4 and 20 Elders sitting on little bitty Thrones around it all right then you see that those are that the the four they're cherubs then you see Angels around about all that remember the angel of the Lord is encamped about those see to me when you look at that when I look at that I see me I got a throne if I'm born again brother Samuel if you're born again you got a throne you are the throne and if you're born again there's one sitting on that Throne ain't the devil and it ain't you there's one sitting on the throne of your heart it's God yes then you got four beasts lonox man and Eagle you got some power to use then you got 12 Apostles in the Old Testament 12 in the new we quote them all the time right amen we they we use them all the time 12 Apostles 12 Patriarchs they're there for the ministry to minister to me and you all right then you got Angels just like I said before you got Angels you got ministering Angels you got angels that protect me in you and some it takes more than others but that's all right there's not a shortage and God knew that you'd need one and I would need more than one but there's Angels right here now yes and if something's if something comes up they're there to take care of it and another dimension but listen we're the recipient of it in this Dimension right oh is not born you this is real this is what your Christian Life ought to be is about these four living creatures these four beasts these zoomes the living creatures have morphed over into beasts to combat the Beast that Satan's kicking out right here Revelations I saw when the lamb open one of the seals and I heard it was a noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see then what happened a white horse rider rides out right go to the next one the next Beast says come and see to the second seal what happens when he says come and see another Beast rides out rides out third one fourth one and then thank God for a prophet that he said on the fourth seal the Rapture takes place now you might understand that but you will later on but he said the reason is is cuz we don't see any in the fifth seal there's no combat Beast there there's nothing to combat right actually then what happens is you go to Revelations 11:13 and whatever 17 and you see that Beast listen that Beast is not in power when we're here now he's getting his power now but he's not going to come into full Authority and power till we're gone right so he listen there'll be nothing to combat those Blox man and Eagle they're going to be over another other dimension with us everybody with me all right they're going to send the Holy Ghost to to anoint not to anoint but to to anoint two prophets that get the Holy Ghost that give the Holy G that get the Holy Ghost and present it to 144,000 and they receive the Holy Ghost everybody with me okay so one of the four Beast has come and seat now brother talking about the three different categories look outer Court inner Court holy of holies everybody with me on this outer Court in court holy of holies where is God sitting in the holy of holies that Center section that's right everybody with me then the Holy Ghost is around that to protect it then you've got ministering Spirits or ministers that that Minister the gospel to you all right then you got that last ring is Angels cuz listen at least a third of them angels are bad the Bible says remember Satan preached them a sermon and they took his sermon besides the other sermon that that God was preaching I mean God knew that but they're there to do what they're there to run that guy in front of you they're there to run to have something fall how many of you had a miracle in your life okay if you hadn't just wait on just just wait just wait well when you had a miracle in your life that meant that there was an opposition here that was trying to do something to you that wasn't God but thank God there was something there yes sir to combat that yes to move that ladder out of the way to move this over here to move and even if you go through something you remember years and years ago when I when I drove that 3-in nail through my fingers they went all the way through both of them and stuck in that one and it was a 3-in nail from a nail gun po well you say well boy the the the angel didn't help you on that when he was a little behind no the greatest the greatest testimony was is when I went to the doctor for something else I had my finger wrapped up and he said what's wrong and I unwrapped it and I showed it to him I said I drove a 3 in nail through through directly through that finger in through that finger and into this finger 3 Ines worth it was sitting just like this and I just pulled it out he said oh said who fixed it for you I said well well I didn't tell him this but I should have told him yes I said well we have a physician and he's pretty great but I said I said I never even went to the emergency room he said let me see that and you can actually still see you know when you nail the nail Brother Gary knows there's an X where that where that point goes in there's an X in the wood well there was an x on my finger he looked at that and he said is that where it went in I said yeah right there he said you know he said he said just about a paper thin Edge if it would have been up above it would have cut this major tendon and said your finger would have fell and would have never would have been able to pick that finger up again he said if it had been about a paper thin Edge down this way he said it would have stuck and your finger would have been stuck straight out like this for the rest of your life you wouldn't have be able to bend it he said if I was a surgeon is what he said he said if I was a surgeon I couldn't have put that nail in a place where I didn't hit one of those nerves or tendons I said well I know one that did sometimes to he lets our stupidity take over for just a moment to do that to drive it through there and then for a doctor to say if I was doing surgery on that I couldn't fix it I said well doc I know one that did I said I never went to the doctor never went to the emergency room we put a little Epsom salt on it Epsom Salt's good for those of y'all don't know that epom salt's good for a lot of stuff but I you know what epom salt is okay learning curve here it's good for your plants it's good for your fingers it's good for your sore muscles and it's a good laxity if you'll take it but that to me see that to me that's the testimony that I can give that even though stupid me I shouldn't have been doing what I was doing I when I was bouncing and I had the trigger pull I was bouncing across a header well that bouncer that header was bouncing well I got to the end it just moved over just a little bit and instead of going through the before it went through my fingers but to go to the but to not have to go to a doctor and to go and have him testify that you you should have hit something cuz man that's pretty narrow and if y'all look at a 3-in nail a 3in nail is at least that that thick going through that there ain't a whole lot of room right there he said I could have surgically never took that thing out and not hit something I said well I know one that did so see I can that's been about 20 years ago when I was building my house and oh yeah it's got a little arthritis in it but so do everything else and I didn't put nails in that we laugh a little we cry a little but but you think of that things in your life that God's done for you you think about that it wasn't by chance I do not believe in luck I do not believe in luck at all I believe in being fortunate fortunate to have a God that take care of you and to be so strong well there sit one over there brother Danny we all got this testimony that just an inch or more and his head would have hit concrete right it wouldn't have been far that concrete block when he fell he said well the angel should have caught him well he's sitting here didn't kill him God needed him for something joce he needed him for something Joy okay joce needed him for something there you go that's right but we see these scenes but let's watch this one right here and then we'll close we won't even talk about the other Church age I like talking about testimonies in our in our life cuz our life our life is molded the thing things that we go through is molded it molds our character though God slay me yet I'll trust him though God break me up yet I'll trust him though God let something drive through my faith I trust him amen listen I trust him now more than I ever trusted him as you get older you will trust him a whole lot more right so Jewish tradition says that the four standards under which Israel encamped in the wilderness to the east was Judah where's Judah where did where did Jesus come from the tribe of Judah ain't he going to come from the East and he's the lion of the tribe of Judah this is not by coincidence folks this is perfect the East was Judah to the north was Dan to the West Was Ephraim and to the South was Ruben where respectively a lion and eagle and ox and a man they had a banner I'll show it to you real quick while in the midst was the tabernacle containing the shika symbol of the divine presence of God the talmood saw these four creatures the four primary forms of life in God's creation watch it also noted that the 12 tribes of Israel camped under these four banners you had 12 tribes you had three tribes on this side three on this side three on this side three on this side but they had a head Banner right that was inside right next to the Shak Glory so now watch Reuben symbolized a man Reuben was the oldest of the Patriarchs he was born first he was first born the man right then you got Dan which is the eagle many things about Dan that went on in their tribe we we we'll maybe we'll cover a little bit later but don't need to cover it now but he symbolizes the eagle Ephraim symbolizes the calf of the O and the rest with Judah which is obviously the line of the tribe of Judah well now this is going to I don't know if you can read see all that but that's the way they were around the ark there was the tabernacle the Levites the sons of Aaron then you had Judah from the east line of the tribe of Judah then you had the Dan you had the eagle what up then you had the ox to the west then you had Reuben which is the man at the bottom and that's the way God set it up in the wilderness okay where's God now he's tabernacling in man that's you he's tab this is you all right and what are the Levites to do the Levites are to what carry the word of God to the people that's right all right they came out of here and they ministered to the people is everybody with me all right then you had your people that lined up all the way around but you had the banner of Judah the banner of Ephraim the banner of ruin the banner of dead and they all were with those four beasts that Ezekiel Saw line ox man an eagle and that's the way they were positioned now as far as us as believers that's a symbol of us it doesn't mean that we have Gad and Ruben and Simeon we we have those four combat Beast that God thought enough to put every one of them had a banner sticking up and that Banner went first you had the lion Banner the ox man and Eagle those banners stayed there and they and you know you can have a whole sermon on how they uh when they when they got ready to move it wasn't just they just got up and took off read reading Leviticus they had to take the Tabernacle apart the Levites had to take the Tabernacle apart okay then you had all these and I don't know which one went first but there's there was an order and it would just line straight up to where they would be around that Ark and they would go through the Wilderness that's a symbol of what God's doing to you when you move those combat beasts move with you they're right there with you all the time to combat why were they why were why didn't they have like all 12 down here you left your back open you left your sides open military man that would have been horrible somebody could have come in and said oh we realize they don't have anybody on that top side we just going to come in from the bat Satan says oh I think I'm going to come in from the backat he ain't got oh there it is it popped up there cuz you got all sides covered am there's no way the enemy could get into that Tabernacle without somebody sounding a trumpet on one side of the other then they went to battle this is the battle so the temple guards all those Temple guards is the holy ghost in your life that guards you every day he said I'll never leave you nor I will forsake you I'll be there all time I'm the power that you need every day to survive through this age that we're in we thank God for that don't we we thank God that he did that so real quick before we close let's just go through this real quick the tharan ages we're coming up to it's the longest Church age it's from 66 to 1520 about 900 years it is called the Dark Ages and also is called it has the O anointing because longest Church age it's actually the longest scripture describing the church age all right but the meaning of that is a dominating female or it also means continual sacrifice listen they didn't just all give and Josh gave me a thing I didn't bring it on my phone he looked up what 68 million people would be it would be the whole state of Los Angeles and the whole state of Texas right cforia California and Texas 68 million people it would obliterated two states two of the biggest states in the United States also the UK has 68 million people in its in its country it would obliterated the whole country that's how much they killed that's how much The Killing was the natural killing during that church age was is worse than a war that's not a war I don't think you can probably combine every war that's ever been fought make it 68 million listen folks under the ospice that they're right and we're killing these people because we're right and they shouldn't be on the earth cuz they're wrong and those 68 million were Christians but the Roman Catholic Church was killing them we think 6 million Jews in a few years by Hitler remember brother Bram said one time I believe he one time he said that Spirit never died it just went from there over to Hitler Hitler caught that same Spirit to get to get rid of a certain group of people cuz that's how Rome was get rid of a certain group of people and we'll have we'll have a perfect world Hitler was going to get rid of the Jews and have a a white white race that was going to be perfect that's what he was doing but he had to get rid of these people cuz they were a thorn in his side they had money they had power and he wanted to take it all the away from him so we see it's a dominating female the messenger was Columba see he lived from 521 to 597 so he died before the church age started and for those of you that didn't know it little George Quinn brother George Quinn he's from Donnie Gall Ireland that's right and and uh Columbus uh house is not there but the foundation stones are still there and you can go every and and visit it um I think Mom and Dad and them did it when they were over there but he was from Donal Ireland and it's a long very long you know why it's long because it's a long Church age but I want to get into one thing right here I want you to look at this city the city had rivers that they said it was just Rivers everywhere beautiful Rivers but they everyone had leeches in them you dive in you come out you got leeches all over you sin's pretty you know sin's pretty till you dive in then what do you get suckers leeches their worship was of Apollo the son God but now watch this is strange how this changes Apollo was the Su n God and you see how I put a little God I ain't putting no Capital God in there but worshiped Apollo the son God son of Zeus hello somebody but he spoke through supposedly through a propheus who sat on a three-leg stool thre leg stool and delivered a message on a three-leg chair now who in the world would make a three-leg chair only them to symbolize the trinitarian doctrine that she was setting on and you had to belong to the temple or you were persecuted you had to belong to this prophetess and you had to pay dues and all that stuff and you had to do what they did and I'm not going to say what they did cuz some of it's really awful but you had to do that to belong or what they would do was they would close your business down they would make it so bad on you till they'd make you join am I making sense here that devil never died it just moved right here and then listen it in here though watch in here and I I'll go back over this again so we'll get ready to close but remember the dominating female is a what a dominating Church everybody with me woman is a church dominating female it started in Ephesus remember we talked about Diana they worshiped Diana then in thara they had a propheus or another woman and in our age is the Apex because that dominating female came into what not only to the church but sorry sisters God bless you but brother Bown in th Church ages when he really cut to women and told told them they couldn't preach they couldn't wear clothes pertaining to a man and you ought to know that I'm I'm saying this you know and you can't preach and all these different things why because the dominating female that's of the devil he said that she had an iron disposition IR n and he said A True Believer should not a sister woman should never have a an iron in Iron disposition or a ruling disposition and if you'll keep reading in the church age book The reason we say well well now you ain't supposed to wear clothes pertaining to a man because the Bible say well you got to help me a little bit further on that well you ain't supposed to cut your hair you're going to have to help me a little bit on that I know what the Bible says but give me the meaning the underlying meaning brother M tells you it puts you in the place of a man God wanted them separated right man you cut your your hair you don't wear dresses well this age I don't know but over here if you wear your it makes a dominating appearance for a woman to wear something pertaining to a man that's the reason is those two Spirits not it Just brother Ram said listen we went through all them years that brother Ram told us this you know don't you got to tell me why I know the Bible says why but it's in the Old Testament you've ever heard that before but it's that dominating spirit that gets on you you lose your headship when you cut your hair sisters you lose your headship when you put on a pair of pants you lose you have asserted yourself in the place of the man by wearing something pertaining to a man see so that explains it to me more than any I had read the church AG book a 100 times and I read it just a little bit a while ago and brother Ram explains that he said it's not he said it's because of that dominating effect that a woman should never have over a man sorry what he said you should never dominate a man that's why you don't have women in in the pull pit same thing you you've asserted that spirit in the place of the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit don't don't said not to put women preachers back here because you've asserted yourself what a dominating female and that's exactly what happened in that fourth Church age it became a dominating Force who was it the Catholic Church became a force and but what did it do then it started changing the ideas of people put them into a mode where they believed in a father son Holy Ghost Doctrine where they where they believed in baptizing entitles where they believed in a a three good system where they believed in sprinkling not pouring all these things that wasn't of God right that was a dominating force of a church that wanted to take over and they did for 900 years they played Havoc with the True Church of God Hey listen sisters brother I'm I'm going tell you you read that the church age book he said a good woman's great what did Solomon say best thing to find if you got a good one he said but a bad ones watering the blood right better to do what better to live on a housetop than live in house with a brother and wife Bible Bible don't throw anything at me throw it at this and that was Solomon he had about a thousand of them so he ought to know what he's talking about let's stand to our feet but that dominating effect and we'll see that that dominating church is what killed 68 million Jews and listen I mean 68 million Christians and brother brandham will I'll read it I'll bring it next next Sunday he says and un told Millions spiritually that went into that false system didn't get killed but went into that false system and was made to do things that they wern't supposed to do God bless you be careful all of us be careful let's man be a man woman be a woman listen I know we don't have any problem here but look out there why are they doing that why are they saying it don't matter why are they saying you can be a woman one time and a man one time or you can use the same bathroom CU you're all the same well let me ask you one question I've never seen a man have a baby man's never had a child right so there's a difference then there a difference in a male and a female like that woman they got to head our human services and health agency she was a really ugly man now she's a real real ugly woman yeah it's online that filth if we put that that's our highest that's our highest Authority for your health it's somebody that's changed their organs so that she could he could be a he could be a she that's the and that's the mentality yes it is that's running the health department of this government God help us that dominating female effect is now taken over that's why even I believe brother R said there'd be a woman in the White House they would be a he saw a woman that would raise up right a powerful woman Catholic church or maybe we got a vice president right so let's stay in our lane we do but just be careful sisters don't try to dominate your husband that's a that's a bad spirit and it's and it's not good at all let's don't be a doormat don't make him a doormat man that's your sister in the Lord but the Bible says ever how you treat her is how God's going to treat you so you better be careful let's don't get out of our lane either all right but if we stay in our lane then it's a it's a beautiful picture of of the bride of Christ in the church the the bride being the church and then him being the the the us being the bride he be the groom let's leave it that way that's the way he wanted it and listen if God don't wanted it that way he can't change his mind that's right so why are we trying to change his mind I don't say we but the world's trying to change the literally change the mind of God can't do it ain't going to happen that's the way it's going to be let's sing a song God bless you the love of God is greater far then tongue or pain can ever tell it goes beyond the [Music] highest and reach it [Music] you that's where he reached and got
