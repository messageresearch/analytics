session and then we'll have questions and answers there's a lot that's good in your life don't take it for granted don't get so focused on the struggles that you miss the gift don't get so focused on the struggles that you miss the gift that God's got for you today that's what we're going to talk about we're going to talk about the gifts at Pentecost that we have they're available for us listen sorry when God gives you a gift he ain't going to take it back either but remember God doesn't do anything unless he's already got it thought out first so he's not going to give you a gift and you ruin it now you may ruin it but he's not going to give you the gift and then you not fulfill it we are absolutely folks listen we're standing on the brink of just maybe even a couple of years and we'll be out of here we ain't talking 10 five three maybe the way things are progressing now with the way that the new election's coming up I don't know we're we're heading toward uh um we're heading towards some tough times maybe but it's supposed to be the most glorious time in the life of the Bride is the end time because it's a fullness she's fully dressed she's ready they've been getting ready for 2,000 years but remember this bride has made herself ready amen through a profit in the end time to bring us a restored word of God not a reformed word of God a restored word of God I believe it's going to happen and I believe if I'm not part of it my eyes are going to see it one of the two that we're going to see this thing to the end there is nothing else there's nothing else left there's no other denomination there's no other place for us to go that's right thereby with me on that I just believe that that's my belief or I wouldn't do this so let's bow our heads de heavenly father thank you again for this service we have a Time Lord to speak about you father I I pray that you do the speaking let they let the people see you Lord and not a man standing behind here Lord with all kind of faults and failures ideas Lord contrary to you father I pray that you'd just take over today Lord take over the speaking but also take over the hearing Lord as you did on the day of Pentecost you you took over the hearing Lord I pray that we hear from you Lord hear what the spirit says to the church father forgive us of our many mistakes Lord be with the ones that are sick be with the ones on on the highways brother Bob coming home there from Brother Duchess different places we got them scattered around Lord I pray that you'd bring them back home safe father just be with us now to furless service in Jesus name amen so we're going to talk a little just a little bit about the gifts Joel 2 verse 28 and it shall come to pass afterwards now listen God's word's never going to fail right that's right it's going to come to pass amen whether we want to or not all right we were talking downstairs brother brother Joe canid um brought out a good point God's got a permissive will you just saw it Moses it said when you were watching the screen here Moses got in the permissive will of God but it's always going to work to the perfect will of God that's right it's not going to work permissive all the time it's got to come to a perfect will of God and we'll read this today where Paul said we do this in part we do this in part we prophesy in part but that which is perfect is come that which is imp part to be done away all right so we believe the perfect one is here not coming we believe the perfect one is here all right says it will come to pass that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and the handmaid in those days will I pour out my spirit you may be seated in the Lord as His blessings to the reading of the word Acts 2 verse1 says when the day I can fly now Lis don't have to interpret so he he can rest for a little bit go for it brother thanks okay and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them do you know who wrote that you know who wrote the book of act Luke he wasn't there that's truly by Revelation there appeared in the vision he saw there appeared clothing tongues over their head now whether they saw them when they were sitting there or not I don't know we've seen the pillar of fire we've seen it we got pictures of the pillar of fire but I believe it looked like the pillar of fire little licks of fire over every one of them and it wasn't different diff it wasn't different licks it was the same lick of fire yes and sat on each of them 120 of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost right then and began to speak with other tongues as a spirit gave them utterance so as we were talking this morning it's important to know that if God said the alpha bride and Omega bride was going to be the same he had to bring he had to develop one just as he developed the other one right so there had to be a Pentecost there had to be this time right here where in Jerusalem there was thousands of people there they had never heard of this holy ghost thing they they that some knew Jesus had come thought he was just a good man thought he was this but he's disappeared even his body's gone the there there's nothing there's nothing to show he's living here anymore but there's 120 people did what he said they went to the upper room he said go and wait on the Holy Spirit or until you're endued with power from on high well see that's where truly as we're reading that isua street how the isza street you know they always called they had a Terry room well that's what they would do if you wanted to receive the Holy Ghost there'd be a room in the on side of the church and you go t there and wait pray sing do whatever until the Holy Ghost fell on you or people laid hands on you and that's where you that's why he said t they went to the upper room and they T that's where they get that from you don't have to do that that was just a something they came up with you don't have to do that you don't have to go in a room and and and do some formula or wait on something you can get the Holy Ghost right where you're sitting that's what happened on on after Pentecost there was a man preaching the sermon and the Holy Ghost fell on the group of people and they received the Holy Ghost all right now we know it's for which you can lay on hands we know there's different things you can do but you can receive it right there in your seat I wasn't even in a church when I received the Holy Ghost brother Brion wasn't either he was on the he was on the rail railroad or he was in a in a somewhere and he said that one guy remember he went out in a pig pin and got that Holy Ghost out in the pig pin or that's not a good place to be but it's a good place to be if that's where the Holy Ghost is if you're going to receive it that's a great place to be and some kind God to put you in that place he knows what we need I want y'all to know that he knows what we need before we even breathe tomorrow's first breath in the morning he knows what we need amen the Holy Ghost is not somebody that will tell you wrong the Holy Ghost is not somebody that'll do you wrong amen so everything he does is right what the problem is is we can't get it together sometimes with our own Humanity cuz we still are a three room house amen but we got to yield we got to yield ourself to that power right and forget ours that's right not my will but thy will be done so on the day of Pentecost over here in 8030 they received the Holy Ghost then you look through 2,000 years man got a hold of it and like I said before if you watch that uh I don't know if you look that go to YouTube and put Ina Street and there's an old black sister that was at the Revival and an old black brother and they're interviewing them and it's so far back the interview is done with a a little bitty microphone that's got a cord on it it's not even cordless I think it was back in the 70s but she said everything was fine till man got involved everything got invol got was just fine she should just sweet humble said but man got involved wow if she saw that if that little sister saw that it must have happened really really I mean it must have been really bad which we know it is cuz when brother randam walks on the scene you've not got a Pentecost one denomination you got probably a hundred different factions Church of God Church of God of Prophecy some some play the piano some don't play the piano some get the Holy Ghost because of this and they get the Holy Ghost because of that and and right brother Brandon remember carnal impersonations came out of that Pentecost because I wasn't kidding this morning there's two Spirits one's holy and one's not there's only two Spirits one's holy and one's not so you can differentiate yourself but this one over here that's not can act almost like this one that is come on anointed ones at end time it can be the true Holy Ghost but you can be anointed you in your soul there's got to be something that keeps that out and who is it it's the devil right it's your and my idea that's contrary to the word of God instead of yielding and letting God just sweep on through and take care of all of it we start slamming doors well I do so pray for me Isaiah 53 the people on the the brothers and sisters 120 now remember Mary was there so there was women and men involved so they all received the Holy Ghost 12 in the upper room but remember they were tutored by God himself the holy ghost or the son of man told them everything they needed to know during the time now a lot of things they didn't understand a lot of things they didn't believe come on where did them other 380 Brethren go that saw 500 of them saw him after his resurrection I mean come on let's just be let's just be honest we had brother Dale for 50 something years if we us to walk in that door right there in human flesh post office can burn I shouldn't said that never sorry I'd never go to work a day in my life I'd hang around that guy cuz he got something and I want that something but he was seen a 500 people in that condition from Death to life again and 380 of them just went somewhere else 120 of them the only ones went in the upper room did what he said so guess what we got to do what he said do what he said don't worry about everything else so the Holy Ghost and speaking through Isaiah is talking about by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many he's the only one that can justify us we know that you've got to know that you cannot justify yourself God is the only one that can justify you so much to where you will not be accounted to that sin thank you Lord amen that you'll not ever be accounted to that sin that's why the blood of Jesus Christ eradicated sin if we'll just believe it those in the Old Testament they didn't receive the Holy Ghost like you and I did right they had an anointing that's right cuz the blood of bulls and goats they didn't have enough word to get their soul clean but when Jesus died he cleaned up Moses he cleaned up David he cleaned he took and oh come on somebody I just I just realized that he wiped their sate clean David's not a murderer no more David's not a hormonger no more Moses is not somebody that brother rown said took his own will no they're clean pure God just brought them right back up put their SE in their sins in God's forgetfulness never to be remembered again then boy you come up to now where you take a fifth seal Jew that don't even like Jesus now those people lived the life they wanted to know who the Messiah was Moses Isaiah all those different ones David Goliath I mean Samson they all had flaws but they were looking toward something happening to take care of all that right and it did but now we're looking at a Jesus Christ that now not only eradicated sin for the people that loved him he eradicated sin for the people don't like him amen fill Jew but he had to because he is the one that put them in that place that's to me that's a just and righteous God Amen he blinded him he blinded his own children to get me and you here he loved us so much he blinded and divorced his first wife hello he divorced his first wife Israel he said he did amen because they went whing but he had to do that and then blind their eyes so that you and I could come in and all the millions of bride that'll come up in that Resurrection every one of them come out from under that the fifth seal Jew if he hadn't blinded their eyes we would have never come so praise God for that to me talking about justification he was just enough not just enough he was just enough till he did it to him and he's the only one that can impart eternal life and he imparted eternal life to him because he's the one that made him do that ah I love God he's perfect in what he does and there's a fifth seal Jew there though to show me and you that we weren't looking for him either we were Blasphemous we were Sinners he came looking for me and his in his expressed listen to this his expressed job was to eradicate your sin yes sir that was his job you want to call God give God a job Jesus Christ had a job he had a job to where the father can't see your sins no more forever oh come on praise God that was his job to eradicate your sins and to look and to show me there's a just God listen the devil's not just he's not fair no you can't ever say God's not can't ever say God's not fair God's fair you and I are not but God's Fair Satan is not he hates being fair cuz listen he hates truth but just but a righteous judge is the only one that can tell the truth right cuz he Justus and guess what he done I've told you before he justified you yes he did when he took your sins away oh please don't ever forget Calvary don't ever forget what God did for us we can talk about message all we want to but just do not forget just simple salvation that God's picked you before the foundation of the world hid you from Satan in the womb of your mama oh come on somebody but when you came out you came in Satan's world but he knew by predestination so he just put somebody with you he put your special angel with you to walk you through life as brother Joe we were talking about if God saw you at a certain place there's no way Satan's going to get you till that no way cuz remember God can't change his mind I hope we catch that yeah we were predestinated we were predetermined but in God's mind not mine and yours that's right we have peanut brains as daddy always said we have peanut brains God don't have that so he walked us right through this journey to get us to his point point to give us eternal life amen oh thank God everything you went through everything your life took a turn this way or this way or that way or that way yes sir was ordained of God that's right you responded to the call oh Lord that's what makes you different than the world and you submitted yourself to the call see Satan had a call sorry Lucifer had a call to be the anointed chair to be the song leader to be the one that says hey you do this God said you say you take care of that brother Ram called him God's right-hand man right-hand man boy you got a right-and man that's the guy that helped you well until iniquity was found in his heart until he wanted to be up here instead of down here I don't know how I got off on that but praise the Lord John 17 that's just where Jesus is coming to the end of his life right he says sanctify them through thy truth yes Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world I'm just going to throw them out there and just let them just just flounder around like a fish out of water that's not what he said he said as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world amen and he what he equipped us and them for a job that's right remember brother Brown said if God sends somebody he don't just send them he goes in them do we really believe that he went in US yes took us through the journey through all of our faults and failures and ideas he was right there yes sir he's an long time God yes he is that's right he sa you didn't get saved two days before God saw you get saved you got saved the day you got tired of being tired oh Lord sick and tired of getting sick and tired oh praise God oh salvation folks I'm telling you don't never lose it that's right you know there's a you can't lose Sal your salvation but you can lose the joy of it as we sang the song restoring un to me the joy brother Brown said d David didn't lose his salvation he lost the joy of it we got to get back to get to the joy of that salvation amen sanctify them to thy truth Thy word is truth as thou H has sent me into the world even so I send them into the world and for their sake Jesus is doing something for a group of people he has set himself aside so that you can be set aside right that's a a and for their sake I sanctify up come upon part part of the apart from the world that they also might be Sanctified through the truth see we can turn and look at the guy that is our justifier he's our sanctifier and he's our Holy Ghost filler one person Jesus Christ amen we ain't got to look over here and find another it's right there that one person amen talk to that one person talk to him talk to him like he's your friend neither pray I for these alone but for them in 20 24 September the 1st also which Shall Believe on me through their word hallelujah oh praise God John 20:21 then Jesus said to them peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost that's the same thing that's the same thing the Holy Ghost did in the Garden of Eden as we were talking about this morning same thing same guy same breath made Adam a Son of God remember he's the only one in the in the Old Testament but he wasn't born and then given that he was given that at full birth so he couldn't be our brother he didn't have a belly button amen he he was born from a womb so Jesus Christ had to come and have get a have a belly button God had to have a belly button praise God he did he chose it that way cuz we look down we well we might can see ours I don't know if you can see it or not whosoever let's continue on whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them you see this you read this he has transferred that power to you and me whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained you watch what you do with people you watch what you say about people then this is a quote where the they said in the Greek Lexicon that the only two times that word used is he breathed on Adam and he breathed on the people that before the upper room let me ask you a question they asked brother random a question why do you think God did that why do you think Jesus Christ did that he didn't have to right he didn't have to breathe on them for them to get the Holy Ghost cuz it was already a promise in the upper room it was already already promised that you go and be endued with power more High that's what happened in the beginning that's what he that's what they just the commentator said here if it happened in the beginning and man fell to get man back up he had to breathe on them and say receive ye the Holy Ghost that's why that's what I look at I mean if if if that was spoken then man fell then something's got to be spoken and it had to be the same guy that spoke spoke there that spoke here amen and for us to be raised back up right cuz remember that was the fall and we've been we're going to be what we're going to do away with the fall you and I in this end time are going to do away with the fall sir dear brother Brandon what's the difference between Jesus breathed on the disciples and said receive you the Holy Ghost when they had to go to the upper room to trry it was a promise he gave them breathed upon them his promise and said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a promise he was so you know that to receive that was so strange because nobody ever received it everybody with me Adam was the only one and he's gone so he actually walked them through the whole process before he left he was so gracious to say you're going to receive this go go on ter in Jerusalem but this is how you're going to get get it you're going to you're going to go to the upper room and eternal life is going to be breathed into your nostrils they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled the same thing is when we lay hands upon you to be healed then you go on about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled so the Holy Ghost there's always a promise and watch what um John the Baptist said John the Baptist said I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I who shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire amen all right the Holy Ghost is a timy gentleman amen but there has to be a fire to burn the old you out firsten justification chop chops past sin sanctification drives unclean Spirit out God's trying to clean this mess up then he comes in with the Holy Ghost and burns all a fire that you will not ever be acquainted with until you get the Holy Ghost cuz he burns it out there's no smoke there's no literal fire he comes in and actually takes that old nature and takes it completely out of you oh praise God if you had never been born again you ought to try right am oh yeah we're going to fight that old nature whole time folks cuz remember the S Satan's still alive he's right here and he still got it in his hand God don't see it but Satan still got it right here and Everywhere You Go by he goes right well pray for me then if y'all don't say Amen pray for me because he does me he knows where I live Luke 24:49 said behold I send here A Promise upon you but tear you in the city of Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high or till I sink in inside of you I'm not going to come just be with you I'm going to come and be in you so there's no message to the first age we we talked about that there was an outpouring of the Holy Ghost Peter was a spokesperson then what happened then they said how do we get saved and what does Peter say he says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and what you received the gift of the Holy Ghost for what the promise here we go with the promise again the promise is to you and your children and to them that are far off even as many the Lord Our God shall call amen but then after all that they had there had to we we had to wait on a prophet to come a Divine reveal of the word Paul could take that Old Testament and make it sound like it's just for me and you and it is but he took that Old Testament that we looked at the law and the killings and the eye for an eye and the do this and don't do that and he took it and brought it right into the New Testament and he just made it more plain than ever before that's a Divine revealer of the word of God which means God spoke directly to Paul and Paul spoke spoke directly to you and me all right now I don't say William Seymour and and Peter that God didn't do the same but he didn't do it in the scale that he did it because Paul was the first church age messenger he was in the Bible brother Bram was the last Church age messenger Malachi 4 so he's in the Bible all right so being in the Bible they're Divine revealers of the word of God we had to have that we had to have that in this age that's right a Divine revealer now brother Brandon wasn't Divine come on he was human we were talking downstairs listen if God hadn't protected that man he'd have been a murderer that's right that's right and tried to commit suicide twice right amen I don't I listen he didn't say he sat down on a rock and thought about it he put the gun to his head pulled the trigger nothing happened amen he was up a pole 20,000 volts he took his glove off and reached up to get it God wasn't protecting William brandham he was protecting the gift that brother Bram fit to and he had to come to that mature part and let's don't forget that he had a temper and he loaded Ed eight shells in a in a gun huh see Jesus platted robes that didn't kill anybody brother brandom loaded that gun and he was going to kill them boys remember he kept firing he another one in kept firing nothing fired what he'd have been a murderer he'd have killed every one of them kids well people don't like for you talk about that but you know what it just makes go brother Brown human it just means that you and I in our Humanity God can speak through us if just let him even through our flaws and through all the junk that we go through almost committed suicide twice he said he had complexes couldn't get rid of some things that's right well he was a prophet for the end time God use the man that's the only man he could use or either use somebody else that's the only man he could fit that to and he preserved that man until he got to that place till he was finished with him and then took him off scene everybody with me on that all right when God's when God's got a path for you to take when he's finished with that he's finished with it cuz remember he don't make no mistakes absolutely that's right now he may let you as he did Hezekiah give you 15 more years but remember Hezekiah was in bad shape for 15 years he should have went 15 years ago when God got ready to take him just be ready to go when God calls so brother Brown said no Messengers to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism so what's going to happen is is God's going to baptize these people with the Holy Ghost and he's going to restore the gifts to the church but he's not he's going to reform them in a part of the word that brother brandham is going to restore right one more time AUD the street they had flaws in their Doctrine God is not ever in a false Doctrine that's right he's not the author of it and he hates it remember I we went through that he hates nism he hates Jezebel religion he hates all that stuff he ha God hates that but he allowed it to happen to prove his point to prove who you you and I can make it through we all came out of that mass if you didn't come all out of that mess that I'm talking about that you were messed up anyway when you came out but that predestinated seed don't ask no questions it's thoroughly convinced that it's God moving according to the promise you okay in there okay for those you can't see you walked in the study she's got a cramp so just pray for a cramp a little further up the road really than Aza Street see brother brandham standing and and it is funny but it's not he's standing actually in the gap between the headstone and the babies and he's pulling them saying look you've got all this your bag is full of the gifts of God why are you not using them we got to get over here to the to The Headstone we got to get over here to the maturity part we still want to just feel good we still want to just speak in tongues we still want to just and brother Brandon was that's why it's called a pull God pulled him through all that he God pulled you through all that and he's pulling you to where he's pulling us up and out of here that's why that headstone is pulling us up praise God that God's in control of this thing and we're not amen thank you Lord amen a little further up a road really than Thea Street we should be the church should be up here I'm sure he went like this not down like this it started with weeping crying coming to God and it fell away fell way away and here's something up here that the church should be up to now what year was that that was 1962 um the seals hadn't opened yet but they getting ready to be open cuz that's in November the seals opened in March of 63 so he's feeling the pull amen be convinced then concerned be convinced listen brother brandham his message never shut the doors of the Pentecostal churches he never shut a door of the Baptist Church his his message never eradicated any Doctrine neither did Jesus come on cus just come right on out and did the same thing the next morning after they killed Jesus right they just kept right on after brother R got took off the scene they just kept right on making denominations right but there's a group of people inside of that listen folks this is the secret coming of the lord it's me and you it's not the denominations it's me and you we're working under the cover cover of the end time message yes sir sir kind of like a CO vert operation that God's doing not us but he's got us sitting everywhere all over the country in the world and the world's going well I think God may come this I well this I think it's this guy well I think it's this person I think it's that person well let's go follow this one we know where we're at we know what we got we just got to start using it we know who we are you got to realize that the prophet said who you are and what you're doing here you're here to defeat the Devil 1962 on the countdown brother Bram said did there come on a zza street where they left the ground and hit the air through the baptism of the Holy Ghost God took the church from an Earthbound Creed into a solo flight in the air solo flight all right you okay she's fine she's just resed okay just as the airplane come in the Holy Ghost came in behind it 1906 isza Street 1905 first fixed winded airplane God Don't Make Mistakes amen but now they did now listen they stayed there they love the airplane we all love the airplane we can fly all over the place with an airplane but if you really want to go out of space you can't do it in an airplane you got to get in a rocket ausa Street never seen those things listen that hasn't been since Christ what's he talking about his message the restoration of the gifts plus the restoration of the word isusa Street never seen those things that hasn't been since Christ was on Earth what's he what's he identifying the son of man Ministry was not at isusa Street hello but the son of man is through his message the son of man is going to appear now in the end time soza Street never seen those things all they saw the great outpouring of the Holy Ghost for three days they had service three days I'm talking about morning night morning night morning night they had three day full service one time and I guess they got so tired they had to quit but wow but it was the power of God and the outpouring the Holy Ghost it wasn't false the Holy Ghost is not false it did what it's supposed to do at that point in time with the people daddy Seymour param all the different ones they were there because God put them there that's right now watch brother R said and Christ is on earth now in the form of the Holy Spirit watch in its fullness trying to get you away from these Earthbound things to lift you up into his presence now we've been a long time since Thea Street we've been a long time since brother br's message we should be as astronauts flying in the atmosphere out of the atmosphere now the the Pentecostals now look one of his eyes was out a colored brother who really started the Pentecostal message in California old isza Street he was laughed at and because he was a negro he was made fun of but he brought a message for that age God works in strength strange ways doesn't he just a little body a fellow could hardly sign his own name but the Lord had revealed to him that this was the age for the restoration of these gifts now not the restoration of the word restoration of the gifts the word restoration had to come by a word Prophet William Seymour was not a word prophet he was used of God but he was not a restorer he was still into the Reformation right huh yes that's why it took brother Brandon it took a prophet to come as he said a prophetic prophet and that's what we're under yes there's no other Messenger to this age this is the going home age there's no messenger coming this is it that's why brother R's message when he got killed in 1965 that's it you ain't going to hear no more you're not going to hear something past what his message is amen amen we got to get right with what he's already said amen all right now look no matter what said it come so in other words a part of whatever they were God was going to bring the Holy Ghost Ona Street in 1906 but everybody got in the atmosphere of it and seen it was that age you ought to read that book you ought to get that book and read it uh it's zusa Street I think it's 100e celebration book but they had all they and they had the the sweetness of the Lord during that whole time they had people from all over the world blacks and Whit sit together that was the whole thing the people on the outside was going look param was a segregationist he wouldn't let the black people in remember he let he let Daddy Seymour sit on the outside and listen to his classes cuz they couldn't segregate but see God had to move that out of the way cuz he don't like that segregation like that so he brought a oneeyed black man he give him the Holy Ghost set him right down in the middle of the church and said listen to what that guy's got to say oh what a mighty God we serve God's going to have his way it doesn't matter but everybody got in the atmosphere of it seen it was that age and seen God vindicate that those people could speak with tongues and so forth it happened but then when he went and pinned it down to this is the only evidence that killed it remember brother briam says one time they cabbage down on that gifts and God moved on then they started separating and making denominations one coming on the cloud coming on the bush but Malachi 4 was given to do two things as we were talking about excuse me a matured bride went in the ground come back on the zza street as untrained babies so there had to be somebody to turn you know what turn means turn turn and sit them in another Direction all right in the heart of the children of the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse brother R came with those Pentecostal babies and was to bring them to maturity but they didn't none of them come oh they came to a place you and I listen once brother Brown passed away that's when the mature group showed up because they started pulling out and making churches Full Gospel Spoken Word Church I mean we were started in 1971 that wasn't but six years after he passed away yeah amen we were actually one of the churches that was like this is a message church cuz a lot of them stayed in Pentecost amen hello I'm telling you we saw it back there a lot of them stayed in Pentecost or tried to bring Pentecost with them yeah the experience yes the denomination no amen so we were the Pentecostal babes you and I listen if you're born again you had a Pentecostal experience yes right come on you had a Pentecostal experience if you didn't you're not born again man you don't how to speak in tongues we see that now but they thought so much of it till they built a denomination on it well once they build a denomination like I said before there's not ever been a denomination been done away with as far as I know they just build more I'm going to split from this and I'm I'm going to split from that well now you see the same thing in the master churches amen yeah there's there's there's Full Gospel Tabernacles and then there's the first church of the Full Gospel Tabernacles then there's a second Church of the Full Gospel Tabernacles they just keep branching off right come on they do I'm sorry but remember Satan wants to get in this he's already got that let me give you one more shocker Satan wants this to fail more than he wants that to fail out there cuz if this fails he's got the whole world that's what he wants he that's his problem he wants everything God's got and be God I just want to be his bride I'll take the promise I'll take what he's got I'll take the Holy Ghost and I'll let him mature me up the statue of perfect man that's that's enough for me I don't want to go ahead of my headship amen cuz when we do we assert oursel above that means we know more than God does and i d a person I know being led by the spirits of God spirit of God being led of the Holy Spirit 195 this 1956 we read this this morning we'll start talking about the gifts here in just a second he was in a he was in a vision all right and there was a later string a nice eighth of an inch tape real nice he said you can't can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things now if you were a Pentecostal listening to that you'd think man you're crazy all we see is Supernatural gifts but they didn't have the word to back it up they didn't have the word to back it up they just had the gifts and that's it now look he said look said you'll cause carnal impersonations and brother R didn't cause it Satan caused it amen remember blood in the hands oil on the head and all that stuff that was all carnal comparisons that's it or impersonations yeah that's right he said you'll cause remember the remember the angel of the Lord said look quit explaining it just put it out there and if they believe it they believe it if they don't they don't but brother B just kept explaining everything he did he got rebuked for that now 1964 the seals of open how many have told you the angel of the Lord in that pillar fired it met me up there told me to be sincere if I'd be sincere it would come to pass I would know the very secret of the heart how many remembers that he said it would be that way now how many remembers that he promised that it would continue on and not long ago for a vision he promised about that pull of that line said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things and when I made the third pull he said now don't tell anybody about this in other words quit explaining it we'll get into the polls when we get into brother R's Ministry and when I made the third poll he said now don't tell nobody about this you've been trying to explain that other don't tell nobody about this this is the great and final pull that's why folks it's just to us amen it's not to anybody else I'm sorry that's why God said through a prophet it's not for our Pentecostal babies it's for mature people that can eat strong meat amen as Paul said I've come to you and I've give you baby food but in time now you need to eat strong meat Corinthians there he is again right here 1 Corinthians 12 he goes back again to them tries to get them straighten up and they do to a degree so let's read this 1 Corinthians 12:3 wherefore I give you to understand now this is Paul telling the Corinthians right that no man speaking by the spirit of God call us Jesus a cursed all right and then that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost so he's putting the holy ghost in the in in in the Forefront got to have the Holy Ghost right you got to have the Holy Ghost through Jesus Christ not these gifts that's right right come on Amen for in the Forefront you got to have the Holy Ghost to understand what these gifts are if not you're going to be just like Pentecost you're going to try you're going to shoot toward the target but you're never going to hit it now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit right right and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations we have song leaders we have musicians we have responsive reading we have pastors we have Elders we have deacons that's the operation of the church yes right but it's the same God which worketh all in all yes but the manifestation of the spirit now watch to manifest the spirit this is what it's going to be to man the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all all right is everybody with me wake up this is the only service now that you you you don't need to sleep through because you ain't got to sleep through no more unless you just do it real early in the morning bless your heart for to one now not one person all right he's dividing it up for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom that's the first one of the nine spiritual gifts is wisdom and we'll break them down later on don't have time we have communion to another the word of knowledge now look what it what's his emphasis by The Same Spirit Amen to another Faith we're not even got the tongues yet wisdom knowledge Faith to another the gifts of healing now do you see that word I I I'm the kind of guy that I'm like Brother Richard Wilson if one word got us out of the garden one word wrong not going to get us back in so I look at every word like brother randam he said look he said I want y'all to know he said he said Rapture in faith lies in not on this is on this is words written on a page but what's inside of that is what's going to Rapture us I like what Brother Richard Wilson we were talking about something talking about different doctrines he said brother R said a lot because every major Doctrine that's false came from Brother bradam quote so we got to get the essence of the message we got to get what God's saying the spirit saying to the church all right everybody with me all right so the Rapture in faith lies in we got to dig in to get it right on the surface it'll kill you Paul said the letter kill it yes but the spirit giveth life we're fixing to eat Jesus's flesh and drink his blood according to the Bible I'm sorry according to what he said right amen quote got a quote for it but we know what we dig in Paul dug in for us and told told us what to do praise the Lord let's dig into what the spirit says to the church not exactly the A's and these and buts all right all right now look the gifts of healing why do he say gifts why is Gifts of healing plural there's two kinds there's instant healing right and then there's Divine Healing which takes a length of time so there are Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of mirales we haven't got to tongues and interpretations yet I've seen a miracle in my life you seen a miracle in your life me standing right here is a miracle in my life but I've seen other Miracles yes sir things that were strange that shouldn't have come to pass they did that's a miracle see we think well sometimes we think we don't have gifts in the church because we a't spoken tongues or prophesied we a got to that yet to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits amen uh we're not there tongues yet no but we're fixing to be the last two is the one they major on I say they I say people that look for gifts in a church to another many kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues amen wow so that's the end of it but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severly as he will in other words God gives a gift out severly as he will all right remember he said brother bam said he God could use some get one sister raise her up speak in tongue somebody else um interpret and never use them again right but it would be of God and it would be something that was in the church amen so God's Sovereign when he does that but what we have to do is we have to make oursel available cuz here's the problem I'm going to read it in just a minute why did we get gifts why is there gifts given in the body of Christ all right for as the body is one now watch for the body is one and hath many members right now watch though Paul's going to reverse that in a minute and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jew or Gentile whether we Bond or free and have all to drink into one Spirit now watch for the body is not one member but many amen we got to see the the diversity of gifts there's one Giver unless Satan gets involved but there's one Giver that spirit is a capital S so we know that's the holy spirit Spirit of God if we have these things working we've got one giver and we've got many gifts given to each one of us all right so why why do we have gifts we had talked about them in a long long time why do we have gifts you ready brother R 1964 Jesus on the authority of the word now this is the truth of God that's the truth anything contrary to that is not truth but what that is to the Nations to the people he's talking about the Plan of Salvation but to the individual now watch this watch how he word this but to the individual then something after God sending his word this way and ministers to preach it he sent to the church Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues that's all for the edifying or the keeping clean of the church bringing the church together but what is it watch what he says separating out what separating out the sin amen watch 1960 what it takes to overcome all unbelief first is Apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors these five god-given gifts are in the church so each of you people who has a Godly Pastor has a gift from God in your church Church a Shepherd pastor means a Shepherd to watch over the flock to teach them the word of God then these other nine different spiritual gifts now he's on the spiritual nine gifts we just talked about should be operated in the church to keep the church clean like ananas and Safara now brother R tell I'm not I didn't bring it but you know brother Ram said that would come back into the church and you know what happened right right ananas and Safar was a husband of wife team and they conspired to hold back a little bit of money but tell the body that that's all they had amen seemed pretty seemed pretty Innocent but that's not what God told him to do I I was thinking yesterday on this you know what they did they held back some tithe that's what it was it was the gain on what they sold they said I've got 50,000 they got 60 that's what they said I mean might amount of money but that's what they did and they conspired in their home to tell the same story cuz he told it she he died and she comes in and she tells him the exact same story and remember what happened Peter said you didn't lie to me he said you lied to the Holy Ghost right we must be careful what we say cuz there is an aniz and a fire time coming again that if we don't keep the church clean God's going to keep it clean not trying to scare you but I just praise God bring it we're here we need to get out of here this is what we need to get out of here cuz that's what he said watch like ananas and safire and so forth the spirit of God rise up call somebody out and tell them they're living wrong wow we get embarrassed when we holler at somebody this says call them out in the sanctuary tell them they're living wrong and rebuke that sin openly that's what the holy spirit is in the church for to keep the church clean look look and ready for the coming of the lord we believe that now then these other gifts coming to the church now after the pastor then there's evangelist and then there's teachers and then there's the prophets cuz that's to perfect the Saints amen the gifts won't do it come on the gifts won't perfect the Saints Apostles Prophet pastors the word is what perfects us yes and then there's Apostles and all these things working together with the gifts right keeps the church perfected and clean and ready for the coming of the Lord amen convinced and concern 1962 if you believe this to be this a prayer line if you believe this to be the spirit of God then it's condemning you that's right and how you going to be condemned the guilty of the least is guilty of the whole you know to do better somebody said as I made a remark last night someone said to me brother random why don't you leave off them women leave off them men quit doing that said you're people thinks you're a prophet he said I'm no Prophet the person said well people claim you to be though why don't you teach them how to receive spiritual gifts I said how can I teach them algebra when they don't even know their ABCs that's the Pentecostal babies he's fighting with they don't have common decency I'm reading what he said they don't have common decency enough to clean themselves up and act like Christians how you going to tell them spiritual things about Heavenly things that's right let the Pentecostal church I bet you where's this preach that Tabernacle no tempy Arizona probably to a bunch of Pentecostal right let the Pentecostal Church straighten itself out get right with God and I'll prove to you that the Holy Ghost will come right in they thought they already had it am while this the church will be so full of the power of the Holy Ghost there can't be one member do one sin now wow the Holy Ghost will call it out like ananas in of fire right but you can't do it when you won't even take your kindergarten training amen grow up he's telling them grow up quit being babies I'm I've taught you maturity for all these years and you're still acting like a baby I'm just reading what the brother Brown said 1963 the world falling apart we wonder today why the gifts and things are not in the church operating the way they should while the gifts are put in the church to separate and take sin out to keep the church clean it's God's toxin that's given to the church it's God also his disinfectant in other words that he puts into the church to kill out all the parasites that tear up the church and God prais his church over with his word and that keeps all the termites out you know so the church can grow a PL and God knows what it takes to do it amen finish right here get ready for communion 1 Corinthians 13:8 kind of correlates with Hebrews 138 charity never fails now that word we know that word's Agape anywhere you seek charity right there you look in the Greek that's Agape agape love not F love agape love charity never fail fath but whether they be prophecies they'll fail whether they be tongues they will cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part all right but when that which is perfect is come now Paul's going to tell you right here he's looking at it but he can't see it yeah come on he's looking at it but he can't see it I'll tell watch but when that which is perfect has come the cleaning up of the church then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child it's not it's not a problem being a child it's staying one I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away the things I used to think amen right amen for now we see through a glass look Darkly so he's looking at with his spiritual eye but remember now he's in the lion age l o n he's not in the eagle age right he's in the lion age he's got a lot of power but he can't see very far over the grass but he knows in his Spirit though that there's a power coming that he hadn't even seen before for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known in other words he knows part what's going on but he ain't going to exactly know what's going on until he comes back here amen and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is agapy love agap love break out in the church you'll hear you'll see the gifts oh well hear them but you'll see the gifts you'll see the gifts operate in the church when we have love one for the other right and then what's going to happen is though once we declare that it's when God's going to start cleaning the church up and I don't say we're not clean but I'm saying the gifts are given to the church to keep us clean so we must be we we go through Seasons am well pray for me I'm sorry y'all come sometimes you look at me like pray for me I go through Seasons ups and downs ins and outs valleys and they're not even big mountains anymore they're just kind of like humps it don't say get on the hump with God it says get on the mountain with God but we go through these things but it's to keep us clean to keep us to where God can God's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel right how can a clean thing come out of a dirty right how can a well of water bring bitter and bring clean it can't we got to get rid of all this stuff the Paul said this weight we i g HT this weight that so easily he said besets us that we can run this race looking toward who not Paul not brother brandom brother Dale brother Dale number two but Jesus Christ yes sir the author and finisher of our faith I can't get I wish I could give everybody so much Faith we' take a Rapture I would but I can't do that you got to have faith you got to have Bel you got to pray you got to do those things as brother Ryan said you got to read your Bible amen I'm not going to read it for you I'm GNA pull out some scriptures for you but you may not have needed this today but somebody did yeah you may need another scripture tomorrow let's stand to our feet how is this right here Eternal that's just 66 books it looks like it's got a beginning and it looks like it's got an end everybody with me but this is the Eternal Word of God yes it is and if you can't see that sometime somebody read a scripture and you'll say I never when they put that in there well pray for me y y'all I'm sorry y'all may be at Perfection like sister said pray for us we have problems but that's why the word of God is eternal to me it has layers right it's just like Dimensions you just step over in this Dimension you read this part this is for you step over in another dimension you may read the same thing again and it mean something totally not mean but mean to you something that you need today that you didn't need yesterday CU it is it is just in that's it that's all we got but remember when that goes in here see that's where your written Epistles amen you live the word of God you are the word it goes from here and it spreads out into millions of people the Bride of Jesus Christ amen let's bow our heads just for a moment dear heavenly father Lord thank you for this day you've give us thank you for the brothers and sisters that are gathered around your word Lord to hear from you father I pray now as we take this communion Lord that you bind all the spirits Lord that's trying to work against the church Lord and and your word and Lord I pray that you'll be with each one that we'll bind together so close as brother R said bind together more and more and push Satan out don't give him a crack that he can that he can climb into Lord I pray that that charity the AG agape love of God will just come among us as a church Lord and it will just seal us all together and just give us strength for our journey Lord and and we do need those gifts you you're You're A Gift Giver and you said you'd give these gifts and Lord I pray that you'd give these gifts to our church our assembly here Lord that we use that gift of wisdom and knowledge and and Divine Healing and miracles and also even tongues and interpretations Lord just whatever you see fit father to keep us clean Lord I pray in Jesus name amen God bless you we'll get started in communion if anybody has a need I'll promise you one thing I've seen somebody healed by taking communion so you ain't got to come up here you just believe that you're doing the ordinance that God told us to do 2,000 years ago and he said do this till I come and when he does that he can't break his promise can he that's what he promised us that we would come to a place to where wouldn't even have to lay hands on the sick but it's still in the Bible but it come a time when we come into as the prophet of God said speaking condition what a mighty God we serve let's read our communion scripture 1 Corinthians 11: 23 through 34 all right for I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it saying take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament remember the testator had to die to bring a new testament in is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes but wherefore whosoever shall eat eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself that's why we T just for a moment examine yourself God is there anything in my life and if I need to go bring it to my attention and I'll go get it straight brother R said go ahead and take communion he said but you better go get that straight all right get it straight take your communion get it straight but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world listen if you're born again you'll never be judged with the world oh praise God you'll never be judged with it this world is falling under judgment right now if you're born again you passed from death into life you passed this judgment that's coming to this earth CU God said it would amen but we've already been judged cuz there was one went to Calvary 2,000 years ago and this is the man right here that's getting ready to go and he's telling us what to do wherefore my brother when you eat together Brethren when you come together to eat t one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together and condemnation in the restro I said in order when I come if anybody don't know what that thir 34th verse means Paul would come to the Corinthians and they would just have like a feast and get drunk and eat mutton and eat all you know they just had like a regular dinner and was getting drunk at the Lord's table he said don't do that he said go eat at home this is not communion is not going downstairs and eating supper right it's a solemn thing it's done with bread that basically has no taste at all it's flat amen and the wine sometimes bitter so this is not going to be a meal that you're going to brag about and put in the paper come on but that's what they were doing and he said don't do that and I'll correct I'll do more for you when I come back because he did have to come back in second Corinthians and talk to him again but not about the communion he was the one that see there's Paul that was not there on that night Peter James John they were all there Paul was not there but God through the Holy Ghost through a Divine revealer of the word called Paul set that thing in order God knows what he's doing he does not miss anything Bible said he took bread and blessed it dear heavenly father Lord this bread has been made with holy hands Lord not going to be held over tomorrow it's going to be taken and burnt Lord so that the new word will come Lord and this new wine Lord that we're going to partake to Lord give a stimulation of Revelation father I pray that you'd bless each one be be with the ones that are sick that couldn't be here today Lord I pray that you'd protect them just Comfort them Lord and be with them Lord in Jesus name amen yeah you know even when they had the Passover the children of Israel that lamb was just roasted it wasn't it didn't have spices on it it was just a roasted piece of meat and it the Bible tells us they that God told them to eat bitter herbs with it not sweet good stuff that like I said you right home to Mama about no bitter herbs put your shoes on huh he said because we're getting out of here or you're getting out of here I don't want you to be fat and comfortable in sitting in your lounge chair hello he said I want you to have your staff in your hand I want you to eat this it's ain't going to be a meal you'll like but it's going to be a symbolic meal that is going to get you out of here why because remember the word of God pretty sharp pretty powerful but it's got the most stimulation to Revelation you'll ever know in your entire life Google ain't got nothing on God nothing at all he knew Google before there was a Google amen dear heavenly father Lord this wine has been made for one purpose Lord and that's for us Lord to partake of it as you said Lord to eat this bread and drink this cup Lord and I pray that Lord will remember you when we turned this cup up that you went to Calvary and bled they cut you up like hamburger meat the prophet said you were unrecognizable but Lord when you came out of that tomb didn't matter what you look like you said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me so father you have the power now to change lives you have the power by the Holy Ghost to give us gifts and in the church Lord to keep us clean and to sanctify us for this journey that we're on Lord I pray father that we will remember you when we do this in Jesus name we pray amen come morning I'll walk by the river I'll rest neath the evergreen tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight oh what a wonderful time come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected you sure will cuz he was and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on you know he hung there for three hours most horrible death you could you could you could you could have 3 hours and stayed there long enough to say it's finished and then he died but that wasn't it brother Brown said when he said it's finished he said it wasn't all finished he meant it was finished on Earth for him to be here and he was going to go away but his work just started come back on the day of Pentecost 50 days later started right over again in a group of people a many membered body not just one body but you know jun's family you know talking about the hair and all I know some of you heard it before but to me it's a testimony to to the things that we go through and and don't lie to yourself we had fun in the world why because that was the prince of the world was in us right but we don't want that no more but it's a fight and a struggle Jesus knew that he said put your burdens on me yes give me your problems I'll take them to hell I'll take him to hell when I go down there and I'll kick him over in there and shut the door that's what Christ did for me I don't know about you but that's what God did for me he went to hell for me he died on the cross for 3 hours so what's the what's the um um the sisters with your hair and I know it tastes a long time cuz I'm with j and it takes a long time to fix your hair takes a long time to do these things you got enough okay but if he can hang there for three listen he didn't hang there listen to me he didn't hang there as God cuz God don't bleed amen God don't feel pain that's he hung there as the son of man yes he hung there and took every sin every sickness every disease he felt every stripe he wasn't just some Angelic being that he didn't feel nothing no he felt every bit of that pain he and I'm sure those Roman soldiers didn't just find a place to put the nails like they do in the Philippines they find a place in here to put the nails so it don't bother your attendant I don't believe they did that to Jesus I believe they took that old dirty Rusty Nail and they drove it in as far as they could as fast as they could but he took all that for us CU when he was on the cross I was on his mind let's take oh thank you Lord we appreciate our new Deacon helping us today brother Anderson thank you so much coming Ryan brother and brother Ryan too we appreciate brother Ryan everybody preach great brother Ryan we all appreciate brother Ry and I'm really beginning to enjoy Sunday school class and brother Ryan you're good you Gabby are a good example okay so you don't have to back off what you said that ain't bragging there I don't apologize for something good I have never apologized for something good my wife's good I don't have to apologize she's good to me I don't have to apologize for it so listen if God's good to us he gives you a wife or he gives you a husband and they're of God and they stay in their place and do what they're supposed to do brother rown said apart from salvation that's your greatest gift praise God praise God for that all right let's talk let's go to our foot washing we know John 13 verse 2 through 17 and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas this car Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and he went to God now he he's coming to a place to where he's got to know what he's doing right he's got it all now he's been on the mountain he went up there with Moses and Elijah remember brother Bram said Moses and Elijah told him about his second coming told him what was going to happen and all that stuff okay he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and gted himself and after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel where with he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto himl Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now in other words Peter you ain't got the Holy Ghost you're just a raw fisherman naked cussing fisherman boy that's a good one to put in there isin't it but that's him that's who Peter was couldn't sign his name made of X Jesus and answered and said what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not only my feet but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean everywh and you are clean but not all see that's another promise there at the day of Pentecost they got cleaned up but that one guy didn't for he knew who should betray him he knew that that um he was right there Judas was right there with him he washed judas's feet knowing he was the one who was going to get him killed that's the god that's a God he love he went to Calvary for Judas but Judas didn't make it he made a wrong choice for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after that he washed their feet and taken His Garment was set down again he said know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I he was showing headship all right if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verely verely listen listen I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord we talked about that today when we standing up here if you're song leading you're a servant we're serving you that's the way it should be the servant is not greater than his Lord see the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent it if you know these things happy are you are ye if you do them let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for giving us an example of humility that you the creator of the world everything you touched you created but yet you took the things that you created Lord and you sat down and took the water and you washed the feet of every disciple and you dried them off and told them you turned around and sat down and said all right guys if I've done this to you your master and Lord then you should do it to each other Lord I pray that you'd give us a revelation of what this day is the meaning of the communion Lord that it'll be something that we can take and continue on with that we be servants Lord and that we'll bow against our own will and that we'll bow to your will father wash our feet today Lord as Peter said not only my feet but my hands in my head father just be with us now as we go the sisters downstairs Lord I pray that you'd be with the Furman this service and you get all the honor and glory in Jesus name amen God bless you sisters from downstairs be reverent
