========================================

God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord you love the Lord this morning let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and goodness to us we ask Lord that you'll just bless our study this morning and bless brother Wade as he's preparing Lord God and prepare our hearts this morning Lord to receive what you have in store for us today Grant it Lord that you'll help us in your name amen so we're getting into Hebrews chapter nine here and uh I've been just kind of going back and reading Hebrews again and there's uh you know you think as you're getting close to Hebrews 11 and 12 that we're kind of closing out Hebrews and and uh a lot of the a lot of the meaty things are kind of coming to an end but now we're we're just getting started there's some good things ahead for us um so Hebrews chapter 8 was talking about that uh in in verse 13 Paul is talking about the New Covenant and that he saith a New Covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away so we were last time we were kind of comparing the old test the old Covenant and the New Covenant the old Covenant a covenant of of of of rules laying their own tablets and a new covenant take those tablets and put them into the heart of the believer so Galatians chapter 5 is Paul's talking about he said for Brethren when you have been called into Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and James said if you fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well so we're talking about agape love that the Life of Christ could be in The Believer and and just to kind of compare again but old and new covenants then become a story a love story where you've got Christ being married to his bride the bride the bride and the bridegroom there standing and that so there there's the whole picture of the Bible laying there for us so as we as we begin to move over into Hebrews chapter N9 Paul is comparing the old Covenant and the New Covenant then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service in the worldly Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the T table and the Sho bread which is called the sanctuary and again what he's doing is he's comparing these things that they were types back then of of the reality that we have now of Christ tabernacling himself in the life of the believer and we know that these things were were examples for us to look and see how that God how that God would move through a Believer through these stages of justification and sanctification into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all these things that it would represent until God Tabernacles himself and moves behind the veil of your flesh where Paul said in chapter 9:3 and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censor and the arkc of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant and over at the Chans of Glory shadowing The Mercy Seat of which we cannot cannot cannot now speak particularly Paul said that these things signify the Holy Ghost in verse 8 of chapter 9 he said the Holy Ghost is signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first t Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience pertaining to the conscience and and I'm kind of moving fast through some of these just to kind of background what we covered last last week um to kind of get get on into into Hebrews 9 but a conscience your conscience is that that that inner feeling that that voice that that tells you whether you're right or wrong the conscience that tells you you're if you were to die now you're you're you're probably not going to go to heaven or the conscience that tells you I'm free you know when you get up from your prayer room and you you've been washed clean and and and and you know because God has testified to you that that that you've been born again and and a guide brother Bram said your conscience tells you something inside of you tells you you're wrong see you know if you die you couldn't meet a holy God so if you uh now now what Paul's trying to lay lay before us now through the holy ghost that through this New Covenant Christ has given us way for our conscience to be made perfect where your conscience is is made clean you you can look you can you can come boldly to the throne of God of Grace knowing that Christ died and paid the price for all of your sins and all of your past life all the things that you did are now covered by the by the blood but Christ being coming and high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for all for us having obtained Eternal Redemption for us by his blood he paid the price because it's it's life his life paid the price and his life comes back into the believer so Paul says for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God dead works is you know last time we looked at you know how the how the Jews will they will take the uh the a Seiler and they'll they'll paint it white on the outside and uh many times you know you have like like the Pharisees just acting things out on the outside it would look like they were they were were doing what what the law required but on the inside they were still dead men's bones so what does the Holy Ghost do the Holy Ghost has power to change you on the inside to change your to change your thinking to change your motives and and that's that's really kind of a point that I've been belaboring is that the Holy Ghost is going to change you you know sometimes we kind of Labor in our minds that well as long as I have knowledge of the word and that's fine but the the Old Testament Jews they had they had a knowledge a head knowledge of the word but the Holy Ghost is going to change your life it's going to change you so that you ain't the way that you used to be that that person that used to look at pornography and L used to smoke weed and all of those things and and think wrong and that your whole life is going to be dead because now you're dead in Christ and you're you're changed you're changed person amen so so it it goes back to I I I really appreciated that sermon brother brother Louise preached Wednesday night because you the what is it it's love and if you if you inspect your life and see do you do you love God because your life is going to be changed and if you don't love God if you don't enjoy coming to the service of the Lord if you don't enjoy coming to church and praying and reading your Bible then uh maybe it's time to examine our conscience what our conscience is speaking back to us has your conscience been purged so that's what dead work what's dead Works dead works is just acting out what you try trying to trying to trying to do right trying to work yourself into the kingdom of God trying to go through the motions but you've been called to to serve a living God a living a living Christ in your members not just something that's whitewashed on the outside but dead on the inside so in Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 when brother Ram was preaching on this he said pass from Death un life what do you care what the world thinks what do you care what your neighbor thinks our conscience has died and we're regenerated and Born Again by the spirit of God to serve the true and the Living God there you are so Ephesians chapter 2 says for by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast there's your dead Works your dead works is where you're just trying to do it yourself for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works there's going to be works but not your works his works so it's not your works that saves you but there's going to be works because these signs the signs and wonders are going to follow a Believer The Life of Christ where the Life of Christ is put in into the believer it's it's going to produce it's going to produce his life so in in in verse 15 Paul says and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth now you can see I got over there in the corners some red blood cells because blood All Through the Bible why life life is really the thing of the Bible we're talking about life we're planting talking about planting a seed that comes up with with life the life of Christ and it's the Life of Christ in that blood cell that was broke on on the cross that that that died for us and and to to come back and the believer life and so what is what is your Eternal inheritance is life we we were talking about when we were examined in he in Hebrews chapter 7 where where uh where Paul used the example of melkisedek and looked all the way back to Genesis 12627 and there's your inheritance laying there that God would give you eternal life so you've got an inheritance that Paul's speaking of the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also be a necessity be the death of the testator now brother brandom said in in adoption he said inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the found foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first Jesus only come a lot here's the way they try to make it God said well there's a lot of people lost I don't want them to be saved so I'll send Jesus down and perhaps maybe he'll somebody feels sorry I know what I've done and get saved oh mercy I wouldn't run my office like that even as poor as I do run it sometimes then I wouldn't do it like that how about God so now as we're examining this scripture where Paul's talking about your inheritance let's just run through the Bible and see what the Bible says about inheritance and I did it again I made it font small so bear with me I'mma beat up on myself Proverbs 13 says a good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just now you think about on the day of Pentecost when Peter come down and he said This Promise is to you and your children he what the promise the prise promises your inheritance that you got an inheritance that God wants to give you his eternal life Ephesians chapter 1 says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will you've been predestinated to an inheritance the ey Ephesians chap Verse 18 says the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Sun Saints You' got an inheritance that you have access to because because Christ died for you TT Titus 3:8 says that being justified by his grace we we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life and Romans chapter 8:1 17 says and if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together you you're an heir to everything that Christ gets because why it was written back back there in the beginning God said let us make man in our image you got access by what Christ did on the cross to your inheritance now now we'll just we'll just examine this kind of kind of touch some highlights real briefly but God the way that God gives you your inheritance when you're born again he he he gives it a a little bit a little bit a little bit at a time you start off just like just like uh uh just like when you're buying a house house you you uh you you're not going to make all the payment at once but you you put a down payment first and the rest of the inheritance is given based upon your character growth first you get first so the down payment is the uh your new birth is the down pavment of eternal life now let's see what brother said and hear ye him he said in the Old Testament a father owned a great portion of ground and he had hired servants all around little places and houses or tents that watched over his flock now when a child was born into this home the father did not have time to take care of the son the way that he should so he'd go and hire a tutor or a razor someone to educate the child now here's where I think that the Pentecostal Church made their mistake when that son was born into the family he was a son at Birth but his inheritance was not yet determined it depended on his character so though being a son and if he was a disobedient son he would not inherit anything but still he was a son but if he was an obedient son he was heir to all things and we've been taught not only through Pentecostal Realms but through the Holiness group and the Badness and what more that when we're born again we're sons of God that's true but that yet that's just the beginning then then it's your character from then on what means the difference now how's this tie in with what we've been talking we've been talking about life that the Holy Ghost is going to change your life but it it it you've got to grow into you grow into your inheritance and what what is your inheritance if we could just kind of sum up what your inheritance is eternal life a mind and body in subjection to the word your inheritance is the virtues of God on display your inheritance is speaking condition the ability to speak to change the atmosphere to change the situation Oneness and communion with God is your inheritance a supernatural understanding of Supernatural things the ability to discern truth from error and fortification ation behind God's word an anointed life and dominion over the Earth full Redemption full Redemption as your inheritance where God will not just redeem your your soul but also transform your spirit and clean out your flu until he can cap you off to to work out full redemption in so that Christ is fully manifest in you until your your body is changed that's what your inheritance is so in returning you believe brother R said yes sir it's time to return return to what brother Brandon return back to the organization I come out of no return back to your inheritance The Inheritance that our father left us what kind of inheritance did he leave wait ye in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power on high that's the inheritance so what's your inheritance is is the new birth The Life of Christ Living in you the power of God that God knew that was waiting for you before the foundation of the world because you were written in him not go join this one and go join that one go join this one wait till the power comes from on high how long until one day two days wait until don't take some little emotion some little frustration wait there until you are dead and buried and Born Again a new in Christ Jesus and every pulsation of your life beats out Jesus Christ so you can see the Life of Christ reflected right and your living the way you go yes sir till you can find that power like they had back there in the beginning now he saying wait until you see that life manifested in you because the Life of Christ is going to change you we're not talking this morning about just just knowing a lot of things but but the word being revealed and and transforming your life and transforming your being so that you are different so that you are not the same the new birth is going to make you different and Hebrews chapter 9:18 he said whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and Scarlet wool and his and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you why why does it take blood to to bring a testament because it takes life the life of that animal had to die for you in the old Old Testament but in the New Testament it was a life of God that gave his life so that the life of God could come back in the believer in Exodus chap 24 it says Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said behold the blood of the Covenant which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words so it was Christ's blood that he gave on the cross where in Hebrews 9: 211 it says moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernac and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are purged are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission and brother B said or the the definition of remission remission before I get to what brother R said that the remission is release from bondage or imprisonment the blood of Christ releases you from your prison house the blood of Christ remission is forgiveness or pardon of sins letting them go as if they had never never been committed remission of the penalty brother R said in the message inside he said the penalty is death and something has to die to pay that penalty so it can only be substitutionary or we're all in death if there wasn't a substitute for us to hold on to you see what the Life of Christ did on the when he died on the cross he give us something to hold on to when he give when he gave the new birth on the day of Pentecost is something for you to hold on to because it says life and man and doing this realize that he needs something to hold on to something that he can put his hands on something he can say this is it I've got it I know it's it so and and the message identified with Christ he said in the Old Testament and and I know again this is small so I'll just read it and just listen in the Old Testament when a man want to be identified at the house of God he took the most innocent thing he could find a lamb and he know the lamb was free from sin cuz it know no sin and he went and took the lamb and put his hand upon his head and confessed his sin and by faith he transferred his sins on the lamb and the innocence of the Lamb back on him and then the lamb died because it was a sinner and the man lived by an Act of Faith of obeying what God Said but what did he do he went right back out of the temple with the same desire he had when he come in because when that blood cell is broken which the Life Starts in one one blood cell and when that blood cell was broken the life of the Lamb would not coincide or come back into the human life because it was an animal life the man went out with the same desire he had so therefore he committed sins continually all the time again let's take a moment to just compare the Old Testament where your desire would not be changed and the person would not be changed with the New Testament where you're going to be changed your life is going to be changed your desires are going to be changed your conscience is going to be purged but there come a time when God made us an example and he gave us the Lord Jesus and when a sinner puts his hands upon his precious head and confesses his sins and his sins is transformed or transferred from The Sinner to Jesus and the innocence of Jesus is transferred by the Holy Ghost back into that person he's a new creature in Christ Jesus that's where I want to be ID identified the Bible said he knowing no sin was made sin for us the reason he suffered was for our sins and it's no more than what is right no more than our duties to look at these things and see that these desires that we have that God put in us to create in us to make us want to be like him your desire is going to be changed when God gives you his life so as we keep reading on in Hebrews chapter 9 Paul says it was therefore necessary NE AR that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the truth but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the Judgment so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation what brother R would say about this statement that he shall appear the second time those that look for him to th he's going to appear to those that look for him brother Ram said and how can I overcome he said on that Easter morning when he rose out yonder and job's body no more than a spoonful of Ashes he was waiting he was that elected group he rose from the grave and entered into the city with Abraham Isaac Jacob job amen for they look for such a person and to those who look for Christ the second time what was he saying that can overcome the things of This World by his grace to come into him and shut your eyes to anything else but him and his word he will appear the second time in glory for the trumpet of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise those which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment and a twinkling of and I be caught up together to meet him in the air now if you want to go back and study this out some more there's a whole sermon that brother BR preached on this scripture right here and it's called The Message look that he preached in 1963 brother Brown made this statement in that sermon he said as a group of Believers today assembled together we want to fix our thoughts our principles and things upon the coming of the Lord looking for Christ who shall appear the second time without sin and salvation to those that believe and are looking for him to come the writer says here that we look for Christ the second time to see him as he is and now we know that the word is Christ in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever therefore it's the word that we look to then for it is the expression of what God is and when God came in Christ he was the expression of what God was and whatever he was he ever remains because he's Eternal and cannot change and brother B went on to say he said you got to see that God knows that you are a sinner and that you have confessed your sins and God put your iniquity upon Him upon him himself and become a man he crossed his strain and come down from being God to be man that he might die in your state to give hisself for you and you confessed your sin and not a manufactured Clorox but a power of God that was made blood that he might take away your sinful Blood by sexual desire and make you a free man and woman of God there you are what are you looking at you say oh I belong to the Assemblies of God I belong to the United Pentecostal I belong to the Methodist the Baptist you're still focusing away yourself away Focus yourself in on Jesus Christ he the answer come back all thy sins which are many are all forgiven so Paul said in Hebrews chapter 10 we finally made it to Hebrews 10 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there and perfect for then will they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goat should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body H thou prepared me and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou Hast had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God brother B would say in the in message oness he said didn't have to borrow any timber Timbers anywhere to make a body he didn't have to borrow from anybody to make a body the world was framed by the word of God the things were made out of things that don't appear God just said let there be and there was he didn't have to go over and say Mr Moon would you loan me a little Timber Mr star would you let me have some calcium God don't do that he didn't have to say Mary you loow me an egg I want to make a body so I can dwell in it God the Creator spoke and she was a mother right then and he made a body so that he could dwell in it and then Behold a greater than Solomon is here he said God is not an idol God is a spirit the musicians can go ahead and come forward and we prostrate ourselves before that and the spirit don't come into some Idol as some so-called Christians would have us to believe but the spirit comes into you and you are God 's house living walking around manifesting the Living God for God dwells not in temples made with hands but a body hast thou prepared me you are God's letter a written epistle God is in you manifesting himself through if you could prostrate yourself before God and say God I'm a sinner come in come into me and then the Holy Spirit comes in and then you are a living Idol of God living representative of God walking around with God speaking through your lips to others and we'll stop there but that is what the Holy Ghost does to change your life and make you a tabernacle for the Living God that God can express himself and you and take you back to that inheritance that God had for you before the foundation of the world God bless [Applause] you
