brother brownon the same where he said when you come and you want to see me he says just see where the angels are singing and go down the little little path and you'll find me there Hallelujah I'll tell you what amen I'm looking forward to that day too amen I had a dream one time of brother brandham and and I've only had about three but one of them sticks here a lot where where in the first Dream he said I hear you're going to India and I said right so they know what's going on over there and and and and amen and uh I said yes sir and I know in America if you call anybody sir that's a s of respect and and and so I said yes sir and he said do you know I was in India I said yes sir I'm aware of what went on in India when you were there he says and he started to reminisent his mind and he says oh it was wonderful and I said yes sir I'm really aware of that and then he turned and them eal eyes looked at it and he put it his hand and this is lovely to me brother amen it was really lovely to me brother Mike he said God bless your ministry in India amen amen a prophet of God said that Hallelujah and I believe it and and I don't even have to worry usually in November I go but now it'll be probably uh January as that's what I'm hoping amen coming that's what they're expecting amen and uh praise God so uh uh everything's in his hand isn't it and uh and we know it's going to be blessed it's going to be blessed amen praise God certainly is so uh the Lord bless you if you'll stand and we'll read the scripture together it's in in in Philippines Chapter 3 and um it's just I want to in one sense go on from what I said this morning uh but you could really go into that I've got Pages here of it on how you were born and your soul and body and and and and your spirit and read on through and how God met you and that old Nature has to die Romans chapter 67 it has to die amen and the new Nature has to live and you crucify the old man praise God and and you live in with that new nature in of God that's said as a Son of God hallelujah and that that's that's where we are now I'll just get to this now in a second love the word don't you love the word of God today don't you love it Hallelujah and um we're just going to turn to Philippines here now chapter three and uh here we are amen just when you're old you just could pull out your tablet it's so the motel and I could do that I'd rather amen only on we like it that way amen praise God something that you can touch amen hallelujah and here we are in chapter 3 I think it's verse seven we're going to than to he says and what things were given to me uh those I count at lost for Christ amen yay doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ my lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and to count them as but dong that I may win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through faith amen through faith that that in Christ we are made the very righteousness of God that's the scripture amen and uh praise the Lord uh Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith amen and he goes on to say uh that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death because that's all he asked ask us to remember uh last weekend before we came here uh we had our our communion and our food Washing Service and before my wife died when we were in Scotland she had her communion service and her foot washing and the the sisters took her in and the one that brought her out she says she put her own feet into the into the water amen praise God so she knew something amen and and we're glad and and my other uh sister-in-law when the day before she died we were able to give her communion but she couldn't swallow she couldn't eat she was on nothing but I was able to put the the little bit of wine in her on her lips like God and she put it her little tongue and licked it you know and I let her husband because she couldn't eat I let her husband just partake for her to do it for her she's your wife amen so it was wonderful hallelujah amen and not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow complete that is but I follow cuz I think a brother W's got you up to the stature of a perfect man he's got a little bit ways to go but it's good stuff ahead amen it's good stuff ahead Hallelujah I'm glad amen hallelujah that we can see that and amen that I may know why I was apprehended of Christ Jesus uh Brethren I count it not myself to have apprehended uh but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are passing behind and reaching forth onto the things which are before that's that's the command that's what he's telling you to do amen you can't change the past amen you just can't change the past but your your future you can you can change it you can live for God Amen and so I press I press toward the mark amen not just casually I press this is my determination this is my focus amen uh the mark for the price praise God nobody no matter what you're in if you're running for a prize you want to get the prize but one thing that I I know some of you people would know about amen uh the the uh disability you know the Olympics for dis disabled people and the beautiful thing that I like about that is there are really no winners everybody's a winner amen amen it's not the first one over the line if you get if you get over the line yourself you're a winner and this you know and that's fair because it's not fair for like a somebody playing for the Bulldogs or whatever you call yourselves here and and somebody that just goes to high schol you can't compare them amen you can't compare them you know ones are professional the other ones taking it around for fun but but so so that's the way it is amen and and thank God that that that's the way God looks at you and I just get over the line that's all just get over the line that's said you'll be a winner amen you'll be an overcomer amen and so Hallelujah that's why we do we press toward the price amen well done that's all I want Well done thy good and faithful servant that's all I need I hear that I'll be a very happy person amen God bless you all gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you Father for the Sunday and you know

the youngest to the oldest Lord may be a piece of broken bread for you are the bread of life Lord break it to us today we pray in Jesus name amen amen and you may be seated praise God hallelujah and we will just go on into the word what I what I thought I was listening to brother Bram there uh earlier where he was talking about God keeps his appointments and uh a couple of weeks ago I was preaching God keeps his appointments to you amen not only to that little woman but to you Hallelujah and he can have an appointment with you he can have something planned for you and he wants to meet you and he wants you to be opened to be there when he keeps the meets the appointment amen and uh praise the Lord I you know I was really touched because when my printer broke down and I couldn't use my notes on it so I did something which believe me and I know brother uh wi could do it amen I could preach to you without any notes no problem amen no problem praise God and I I took that story about her that that invite went by the Pharisee that he would come and he accepted it and about the flunky and all that there and then what brother wi was saying this morning about the kiss there was no kiss given and uh there uh to Jesus uh and there he sat there just as a a laughing St amen that's all they wanted to make him the chief Pharisee of course he was getting all the praise and all the but oh my goodness somewhere and I think the whole key to that story is somewhere God had his eye on a little prostitute amen and that was the whole thing that was the appointment that Jesus really went there for amen and I'll tell you what she was there and we talked about that little woman and her Seck she would have been of that life just completely and Lord God that is this what it's all about is this what I've come to and I tell you what you can make a wrong term folks especially you young people you can make a wrong term and don't you don't need to you don't need to make a wrong turn just keep on the far in line keep serving God in your own life amen and he'll guide you he'll lead you and he'll never feel you that's it I've been watch since 1965 1965 you weren't even born when I came to the Lord and I tell you what you say has he ever fed you not one time not one time he never feel his brother da and he never will feel us I don't expect them to feel us and and I want to just thank you amen but brother uh uh uh wi was saying today about about an offering to use for for for the the people that we go to amen that I hope to go back to and if I didn't get back to them I would make sure because you know something my conscience is clear my goodness brother brother deal give us a lot of over the years but you know something my conscience is clear today what I did without funds amen they weren't mine I never spent them on me Hallelujah they went to the mission field they went to where they were given for and and and praise God personally I don't need it amen you know uh I was thinking I was looking in my place for a a dime and uh I couldn't find one I didn't have one at home I have a quarter but and I have a brother Joe give me a lovely silver dollar amen and uh that's that was very very touching I've still got that and uh amen but I didn't have a DME but there yesterday I got a DME and my change and I thought wow yeah there's a dime not too much scissor a dime not not a lot of money but you know Rusty Goodman saying I couldn't care less if I could buy the whole world if I could buy it all with a solitary dime for lately I've got leaving I've got leaving on my mind so praise God that the US Treasury can keep it all Hallelujah do whatever they want with it Hallelujah where I'm going I ain't going to need the US Treasury to back me up amen hallelujah down here if I'm going to go into Sumer for my dinner I need them but not up there and I'm glad Hallelujah wonderful amen praise God you know I remember coming across and preaching on The Real McCoy The Real McCoy and you know one thing God doesn't want he doesn't want an impostor he doesn't want you to be you know like a numberella you know oh it's for show it's all for show and you've got this way about you and your numberella and then when the rain comes you open it up you got all full of holes but you've covered them all up he doesn't want you to be an impostor amen or an impersonator trying to be something that you're not and and I was thinking I think it may have been an Edwin Edwin m boy but he was a real smart fell a real smart dude you know and it used to be way back uh maybe in 8 1870s or whatever that all the TRS in America used to have to stop after a certain time and they had to do some kind of uh mechanics on them uh to to to whatever it was I'm not sure but to get it up and running again and it could make the rest of the journey and that guy looked at that and he said no that could be fixed and he did he come up with an invention and he made it Hallelujah and the trains didn't have to stop anymore just whatever he did it they fitted it up and boom boom the train went from A to B without stopping in the middle and they call that The Real McCoy because people come in with impersonations amen you see but thank God when he was smart enough to know the copy right and he said this is The Real McCoy amen and when you seen his trademark on it you know you were getting the real thing well it's the same with us praise God hallelujah amen and we've got that Mark of God on us hallelujah that seal of God on us and the devil sealed out and God sealed in and that's the way it's going to be to the destination till we reach heaven and home amen and praise God so that's wonderful Hallelujah to know that and if if a May today as we read that scripture and uh I was I was preaching a few messages because I love to what I usually like to do back home as I might preach some Doctrine to to my my people I like to do that but sometimes you know you've come through a hard week and really you know you don't really want to hear much about Doctrine now you like you like everybody we've all got feelings we've all got emotions and you know what I mean and and sometimes we like that little bit of cotton wol and just maybe a little bit of comfort you know to our own hearts and God knows that as well and that's why he does it so praise God you can you can look at that there I mean I I preached the message on thy loving kindness is better than life well we spoke about a life today amen the life that I lived has loving kindness is far Transcendent than the life we had far Transcendent that's why I know it in Ireland with all the drugs and all the different things in this country as well all the drugs and people don't realize that will never touch the soul not there's not a drug made by man or the devil that will ever touch the soul of mine it cannot do it there's only one thing can touch that and that's Jesus Christ himself the Holy Ghost amen amen and amen and I'm I'm glad to hear that praise the Lord and so amen I was just thinking then uh well I could go down that road or I could talk a we bit about God keeping his appointments but I just as I was in that this morning some of the quotes I thought I'll just go on a little bit today so as we can relax a little bit amen and just sit back and let it soak in brother bam used to say I'll give you a little minute to let that soak in you know it's good Hallelujah just let it soak and don't let it go over your head you know I uh you know I I really feel uh as a minister I I I met a I met a man up in Virginia and uh he came off the platform he was opening or closing a prayer and and and and I as he got off the platform I was sitting down on the left arm saber brother Charlie Spencer was beside me and uh and he looked at me and he said I know you and I said yes I didn't know him so he said yeah he said you came to our church and I said where was your church there he says in West Virginia said you've got the wrong guy I said I don't think I ever preached in West Virginia he said you did and I said really he said yes and he said now this is lovely and he said to me he said um yeah he said it was uh uh Brad bir just up in uh Louisville he said he brought you I said really he said I can't remember that he said you came and he said to me something that I loved he said do you want me to tell you what you preached I said well I said what did I preach he said you preached on restoration a way back then maybe 20 years beyond that and I was preaching on restoration well don't preach on that now because we've been restored amen hallelujah amen the full word's been restored to us so praise God but he could remember that and I I think there's something nice about that when somebody can remember what you said and can can feed on that amen cuz it's a Living Word it's a Living Word Hallelujah every day it's living and God can speak to that's one thing I like about being uh retired to that extent cuz all what brother we said that it was true every bit of it and and you know when you're retired you get up in the morning you make your breakfast and I'll tell you what you can take your time if you have nothing else no appointments to go to or whatever not you can just take your time and read my little dog will lie beside me amen and I'll read the scripture I'll read my uh little uh commentaries and pray and I'll tell you what don't you feel good after that am and you say that's okay I've got a job to go to listen I get up about 7:00 qu 7 for 22 years in the factory I worked in and I never missed reading the word of God and I never missed praying before I went to work amen and the girls in Monday morning they' be saying oh Monday again you know and I said it's a wonderful day hallelujah praise God it's a wonderful day this is the day the Lord had made I'm I'm happy you know and and so so good so God is good God is good to us amen cuz he loves us cuz we're part of him we're part of the Bride we're part of the Bride just imagine that there people claim to be that but where is their Vindication of it praise God there's no nobody ever came like like brother Bram came with a Vindicated message and it's all in the tips I don't care what somebody said he was in a coffee shop and he said this and that I don't care about that there I wasn't there I never here running like that but I've got all them messages like you had there that's what you listen to and you'll find out what he did say praise God not what somebody said he said hallelujah amen and that's I I loved old Billy Andre you know Billy came and he opened our church for us and um and we had a wonderful time seeing a wonderful Miracle at that time of a of a fellow but uh Billy would say amen he said his old tennessy accent he said don't tell me what he said don't tell me what he meant just tell me what he said you know that's the way he would talk you know fast you know and uh yeah amen praise God praise God and so it's wonderful and you talk about demons demons demons will try and go sometime to you or they certainly will and I remember when I was standing in this cabin and I saw he had fallen and I saw where he was injured and uh my heart he got out of it I don't know cuz you want to see the drop he fell you know but but he he got out he came out of that and he had just cast on for ages and uh anyway that night uh I was sleeping and all of a sudden this thing come in through the window and I just stepped on the bed and stepped on to the floor and just turned around awesome looking thing and you know ugly and and just turned around looking at me and I said get out and just kicked it like God In The Name of Jesus Christ and woo there he went and you would be surprised folks come on now you would be surprised that in these other countries when people like God have needed Deliverance you'd be surprised how easy it is to get them off them spirits of them but amen you can go to a higher where it really needs a lot a lot of a prayer of faith to really touch people in a deeper situation but my goodness they're subject to the word of God you seen that there can we enter into the pigs you know they're subject to the word of God so amen Christian Living our quotes for Christian Living you know uh he said I've made many mistakes done many things that was wrong and and desire uh that that you make not the mistakes but don't look at your mistakes but use them as stumbling not stumbling stones but as stepping stones stepping stones for yourself and for anybody else as a stepping stone amen and that's why we can tell you praise God that he'll be faithful to you you young people he'll be faithful to you if you just amen let him get that lordship in your life amen praise God so that has to be there you know and and and brother Bram told that story about the young guy that went in to do the job and I've met these kind of people I'm sure you all have and they are really smart but they really think that they are it you know there's you know this world couldn't go on without me I'm I'm I'm here and this old man was giving him an interview and and he said to him he said I noticed that you've got your your your your pencil there not he said but you don't seem to have an erasor on it and he said yeah he said I don't need an erasor he said I never make mistakes and he saids well I'm sorry son I can't use you just think about it amen praise God if you turned around to me and said brother George I've never made a mistake I said well God bless you and help you give you the highight to see that you did make mistakes amen but he never judged you in your mistakes Hallelujah he never did that he can cover that praise God Amen and amen so and also a Christian don't try uh to be what he used to be amen no matter even if you were successful I love that little song where uh he wrote Lear Learning to Lean I'm learning to lean amen sad broken hearted at the altar you know why cuz his business had went totally belly up he lost a lot amen oh my goodness he thought God should be blessing my business but he never put God first and he lost it all then he said now what's it all about and he got on his knees and he said yeah I was sad brokenhearted but I learned what it's all about amen put God first you know and uh amen and whatever you are and brother da was mentioned today you see that business brother dawn amen and God will bless that business because he knows what you're doing for the work of God and he'll bless anything that that you do for that amen and so praise God Amen and so we're not looking back where we've been amen that's easy done but we're looking to where we're going amen that's where your me focuses we're looking where we're going and God is not interested enough now think about it God is not interested when does he pull your P part passed up when when is God ever can you say to me now brother George I know it was the Lord and he told me that what I did like I just way back in the past when did he ever do it he doesn't do it he doesn't work that way cuz he knows they're all in the safest forgetfulness forever so amen mistakes I made a few as the song would say but I'll tell you what God's forgive them all Hallelujah and it's what you are not what you were amen oh I was a bad person it doesn't matter what you were it's what you are and where you're going and hard God sees you and God sees the finished article amen hallelujah hallelujah he really does amen and so uh praise God Amen that's a a thing God is interested not enough in your past to talk about it but he's interested very interested in your future amen because as brother Bram said it's a wonderful read it's not just a quote like this it's a wonderful read about that picture taken in the mind of God when you were just and at the ofy just young again Hallelujah all the gray hairs gone amen everything and boy what a that will be and he's got that photograph of you and that's what you're actually walking toward right now right now praise God and do you know something folks I tell you what if there was 500 people outside with big plor saying that's rubbish we don't believe it no that's not true I'd say well get used to it because it is true Hallelujah every word he said I wouldn't tell you if it was not so so praise God Amen and uh uh amen it's powerful he's not interested look at job do you know You' think You' think if you looked at the life of Job very quickly if you looked at the life of Job and I'll talk about my wife as as the Lord would lead me to do it but our little photographs are right there on uh at the front on the right hand side beside the the tape Rim just above it and you can have a little look at her my little amen uh little darling amen praise God and amen so praise God um amen but job you know after after all that suffering you think God would had a bit of a pity party for him you know ah job I'm very sorry you went through all that and you know what I mean like we were looking down here from heaven we really couldn't help you out you know just and it was sad on you you know really the Angels were even crying up here you know and see you going through that he never did he never L he said where are you when I was the morning start for sharing for Glory you know you're going to question me it wasn't even me that put it on you job amen and and there he was and he's talking like God then job says he says oh my I've spoken about things I know nothing about wow and he put a zip on it he said I've I've heard of you with but now I see your eyes and I repent and cclo and ises that's the way God does does it amen praise God so Hallelujah whatever your commentary whatever brother Samuel amen and I want to say this about brother Samuel today amen do you know when I looked at his life I said I saw a Christian I saw a genuine Christian The Real McCoy and I saw it I tell you and that's one thing that ever struck me about him that's a real man a real a real man of God amen and praise God that's absolutely right brother da a real man of God Amen and and and we come in life we're not stupid we come in life we know we can't stay here on this Earth before his coming amen and I mean I mean the the the physical Corporal coming because he's come down in Revelation 10 amen how many in the the denominations believe that well they can believe it if they do want well we believe it because it happened and say it's a reality so amen there no turning back from that amen and so praise God hallelujah yeah and and and so that's that's the way it is and uh amen praise God with Christ it's wonderful and he said all Christianity is wrapped up in one big love affair that's why I can stop here anytime I want because I don't have to go into all what's in here but it's a love affair you know you do it because you I could say that you I said do you love the Lord you can say amen amen love the Lord yeah I remember I was in Thailand and there was three uh girls to be baptized and and what happened is you know they didn't have very good English or nothing like that and I've been in many situations where God's really helped me out of them and so I I I I'm getting into the water there and it was a swimming pool and getting into the water I said now what what I want a testimony now what what am I going to say these girls cuz they don't you know they don't really know and that so I'm standing there the water and the Lord just told me what to do and I said to her name was June actually there you are so you have a counterpart in Thailand and she was the eldest girl and I said sister I said June I said I want to ask you one question and she's can of the broken English yes yes yes I said do you love the Lord and she said yes I said that's good enough for me amen if you love the Lord I'll I tell you what that's good enough for me if you come and say brother George I love the Lord on the word I'll say that's good enough for me amen praise God and so we baptized the three girls that way that day amen I'll never forget that had some wonderful occasions in baptismal Services really like the time when I was in the I was going in to baptize these people and she was a very smart girl like a professor she was a way up in that direction of uh wow beyond beyond beyond and for years she wouldn't be baptized and then one time I got there and her husband said she wants to be baptized I said oh good so we got a number of people down to it was like a big Reservoir and we get in there and of course you're always going to get this the devil just like today didn't like that didn't like that message and I'll Follow That Girl believe me I'll follow to see how she gets on cuz we love her and she's a good girl and God will bless her amen and healer in her hip and that need that she has what was manifested today amen and so you're always going to get these people just trying to muddy the waters so this fell says to me do you know there's crocodiles in that Lake I said really he said yeah so I said well I said that's that's nice to know that I saids because if any of them want to be baptized they're coming to the right [Laughter] place amen praise God the devil's a joke amen praise God he really is he said he's a dumb a dumb devil you know has a good good title for him a dumb devil amen and so praise God it's wonderful amen and uh Hallelujah a genuine child of God doesn't care what the world says amen don't matter I was there I I was there the night that I asked the Lord into my heart and I felt that big wi lifting off me amen and and I'll tell you young people as well when I went in that night when you're in a factory it's a rough place you know some some rough boys are in there and and I told my mom first at breakfast that I asked the Lord into my heart and she says God bless you son and then years later she came to the Lord and and she loved the Lord and when I went up uh to to visit with her she'd take my hand out pray with her amen and are are you trusting in the blood and could never get her baptized tried my best Amen to get her baptized but she no she too old she couldn't and so that that's that but I believe she's in a Justified State I believe that blood has never lost its power amen and so we'll see her one more one time or other amen but I tell you what it'll be a happy day amen and so praise God we just press on you know and as you love one another you love the Lord that is the only test that you can give yourself amen it's like if you I don't suppose you do it so much now as test your oil maybe you do or maybe you just go into the garage and let him test it for you but whatever amen it has to be done to make sure that the oil level's still up high and if you want to know where you are with God you ask yourself do I love my brothers and sisters I know a church in Canada and the girl said oh there's a a sister and she just gives me a bypass amen and that's wrong there's something wrong there amen praise God you can at least say God bless you and Shake Your Hand you may have a different personality you may have different interest but at least you can say God bless you amen we're we're in the one body Hallelujah you might be a hair and she might be a Neil but you're still in the one body so praise the Lord yeah love love is is the thing and and and Christianity has wrapped up a love affair amen he said don't you believe that see God is love God is love amen and and and that's something that you can't buy you can't go into the grocery store and say I could have no $2 worth of love amen it's it's deeper than that praise God and and it's wonderful Hallelujah to love your little partner amen and I used to tell her that all the time I said do you still love me and she just look up with a little smile I said I still love you I said you're the prettiest lady in this whole area amen and uh and you know yeah yeah my we sweetie pie that's that would be an American expression my we sweetie pie that's what she was amen and so praise God I I just thank the Lord for that and it won't be long amen no matter what it's like it won't be long amen so hallelujah amen and he said you can't impersonate love that's true amen there's no way there's no way somebody could come and put their arms in brother W and say I love you brother wed and he knows they didn't there no way you just you can't impersonate it praise God it either reson resonates with you or it doesn't if you've got genuine love it'll be seen amen and you won't need to ask your wife but don't be afraid to tell her you love her even today saying I love you amen and don't be ashamed of sin and I love you too praise God hallelujah so so that that's wonderful amen and a man's character you know I love that because brother brandham got that straightened out for me anyway where where James said that you're just ified by your works and you're thinking that's a contradiction and the Bible don't contradict itself you know and you find that that that Mo Abraham's Faith Justified him so how could Faith justify you and works justify you they're two different things but that was to do with his salvation that the faith was to do with the Covenant that he made with God that's what that Faith was and and God accepted him because of that but when you come on into the story and just think about it that here he is well uh ishmael's gone and here's my son Isaac how wonderful and I'll just sit back and put my feet up and here he comes and then one day God says yesen I want you to take him up to mount Mariah and kill him you say what amen and and and he did it it's a real Bible story you know they're true you know they're true they're not just made up you know people say oh there was no Abraham there was no King David and all that and then they find out that there was Hallelujah but praise God Amen that was wonderful and he took him up and what what touches me about that story was he says to the young man he said now the lad and I are going younger the sacrifice and we will come again that man believed that he would receive his son back even if he was killed imagine that I tell you what you're glad that God doesn't put that on you today amen you're glad God wouldn't put that on you today but you know he did it and and and then that's why it says and Abraham was justified by his works he obeyed the voice of God and to obey is better than sacrifice amen you know sometimes the chain can be broken amen and you know if you have a chain if you got sometimes the sisters might wear a little chain of something but if you break it it's it's broken just just you can't you know it's all going to fall apart and and and you know circumstances the chain of circumstances you know uh can can be very rough at times you can be in you could tell me like you're in a bad circumstance amen and you might be but listen praise God it's hard you deal with it all in your circumstance amen that you know there was the story goes in the war that two prisoners was there and one of them was eating his heart out cuz all he could do was look down and he could see mud but this other fellow he had a different way of looking he said when he looked he didn't look down at the mud he looked up when he saw the stars and he was planning that I'm one day I'm going to get out of here and this is what I'm going to do and praying about it and God got him out and he did exactly what he his heart's desire was so amen that's wonderful and circumstances are just God in control of your situation he knows what the way you're going amen and praise the Lord uh the little missing coin you know she swept the house till she got it because you know what that was really and it's the same with you uh that they they wore the the chain up here of the little coins that was their marriage that was the marriage ring that showed that is a marriage that woman is married don't you touch her she's married Hallelujah and so when she left that lost that coin this was going to be a disgrace to her my the priest says that was your coin and that's why she swept the house so much till she got the coin and said Rejoice with me Hallelujah I found that coin that was lost so circumstances can play on you but get over that and get through that cuz they will change they will change everything changes amen and so praise God hallelujah it's like the the Dynamo amen the electric amen and the electric wire will you put the two wires on wrong and see what happens you make get a big bang boom you know you got to have it done right like we said the the the the letters today the numbers you have to get them right amen and praise God if your wies dead he said and there's no current to it what good is it what goods having a battery and it tells you what it'll do if you haven't got it wired up right amen it's absolutely AB absolutely not amen so praise God let's go on for a little bit amen you know because it's a hard hard thing to comprehend but you know when the Holocaust was going on and people were being butchered for their faith you know you see some some of the the documentaries of them going and maybe the mama going along with her little girl and that little girl doesn't even know what's happening and she's going to go into a go Jamber and they're going to take her life my goodness like a little girl down there what about that what about that amen and God called that the tender hand of Jehovah like folks we we are one day we'll know as we are knowing but we don't know it all down here we don't know it all down here but I'll tell you what just to know that God deals with you in love amen everything no matter if your house burned down today I tell you I wouldn't like that to happen to you but my goodness God is in control of your life completely and totally amen and you let him be that amen and praise God and that's when he can show you his love for you and just think about all them people say well brother George that was terrible it was but where were they after 5 minutes after they were killed amen they were under the altar Hallelujah and and was not a blessing when you read that and brother Brown was preaching on the seeds and said Souls under the altar Hallelujah they weren't Christians there these people are asking for vengeance that's Jews amen and and it's getting all straightened out for us hallelujah and thank God for that give them new rment amen and waiting for that day when their brothers will join them amen and that day is coming for Israel too the Naomi has to come to Ruth amen and praise God Amen and she'll be that Hallelujah so so many just wonderful things amen and uh anything that doesn't serve God's purpose has no Resurrection that's what he says but you uh can't keep anything in the ground that serves God's purpose and you know i' I've done it I proved it myself uh because my my wife she was a raised as a country girl she loved cattle she loved sheep even the last day of her life I had her out and she was our little lambs and she they would all look at her fingers amen just just maybe half an hour before she died and and I'll tell you what amen that's the kind of girl she was and she used to love potatoes and of course I'd say to her jaine you don't have need to do that and she just big part of the plenty of place where she could do it but it was so big for her to do and and I said you don't have to do do that and uh amen she wanted to do it so she did it well then after she plants the potatoes and covers them over then it comes to the place where after a couple of weeks you have to dig up again and recover them and sometimes you would see that seed potato that you'd put in there and you find that it's just mush y just mush and you're thinking how could new potatoes come out of that and the brother was on about it the day amen where he spoke about that germ of Life still in that seat that's still there and that you cover that all up again and you come back in so many months and you've got a crop of lovely potatoes that life's there folks and it's in you too and brother B I'm talk about it even if you went back to gses I tell you your theophany will join up with your Resurrection morning one day it's coming hallelujah it's turn the track amen that's coming H to us hallelujah amen so praise God I and uh Amen to us I I love it you know as a Christian uh never take anything for granted never let the word of God get common to you amen and and you might say well I know everything that he said I know it I've got aead knowledge of it but put it into action in your life amen live it out that's what the whole point is amen not just a head knowledge but a heart knowledge amen and praise God faithless to the where to the soul amen that's the faith is to the soul praise God and when you're a Christian you ought to I had time yesterday when I'm coming by uh L Heartwell and up and not there to look over a little glance and say it's beautiful Lord It's Beautiful Lord any place that's remains Untouched by human hands it's beautiful Hallelujah and that's why I love them places like that and I I look out at the sea coming in every day at our place it comes in it goes out it comes in it goes out never misses Hallelujah and and I just just thank God for the mountains I thank God for the valleys and I thank God for his creation and what a time when the curse is lifted off his creation what a day that'll be amen all the animals you know your Bible is is a unique book I mean you're not going to read the the Quran where it turns around saying and the lion will lay down with the lamb and they'll Feed The Gather on straw a lion eating straw oh you've got the wrong lion no I haven't got the wrong lion Hallelujah that's what God's word says scripture can not be broken and one day you'll see it one day you'll see it and the little child not a millennium 100 years of age you'll see it it's thus sayth the Lord praise God it's wonderful you know and amen so Hallelujah now could I say this amen well even when with with with with Abraham God gives you signs amen and that's when I came down today I was so glad to see that sign outside the church where it's you know amen uh the spoken word amen church I said oh here amen and and you just go by the directions folks you know where I live and there's a big what we you may call it a turn around all the roundabout but we've got we've got them there in in Ireland and um and just below our house they made a bypass and I'm glad they did it the day the way they did it and we've got a roundabout and I would tell people I mean smart people educated people the university Professor like and I tell you what I tell them now you come round the round about you go to where Don go turn and 300 M or let's say 350 yards down from that roundabout you'll see a little turn off that leads up to my house and they'll phone me two miles later and say where's your house so somebody wasn't listening somebody wasn't listening amen ien if I had went on what McDon or whatever to car whatever you call that you know what I mean I wasn't listening but I was listening and when I seen the the the the the the the the the road that's where he said turn off so I turned off and followed the directions and it'll leads you to the proper place amen so because he's Supernatural he always deals with people through signs you know can I tell you something that you might be interested in I was in up in Nepal I loveed Nepal you it was so peaceful it was beautiful and there were a different people than the Indian people different people poer people but happier people and anyway so we were up there and uh one afternoon the children were down there a lovely day and and they're playing down there just below the house and you climbed up a little ladder and then there's a little kind of a a platform going around the house you could walk around and the door into the house that was all up on the on the things like that so I was sitting there at the door and uh something just quickened me to get up so I got up and I'm stretching myself and I went around the side of the house and I looked up and I nearly fainted because on their highest mountain there was a cloud now this is true God knows I wouldn't tell you a lie and I looked at that cloud and it was the perfect ship of Ireland perfect ship of Ireland and there the you know if you look at Ireland you see the five the five toes at the bottom and you'll see right up to where Don go is and right up there in Northern Ireland the largest lake in the UK is in Northern Ireland it's dying at the minute but it's there and I could see that in that cloud that blue place right exactly where it ought to be now that was on a 15,000 ft mountain and we were right up I don't know how close we were to it but I could see that that cloud was there and I run over and run around and I pulled out my camera and run back and took it and and you know people were saying what was that all about what and I said I don't know I said I don't know what it was I said but I will be praying I'll go home and pray about it and I did come home and pray about it and you know what I what I got from that amen that here we were the highest Mountain was a representative of the Bride we are the highest mountain we are the highest form praise God the wife nobody comes above the wife Hallelujah and so we are the wife of Christ no and so there it was and as I looked at that mountain I could see the highest mountain and that was the bride that was in Nepal that's who we were ministering to and then I say well what has Ireland got to do with it and he said because the messenger that I sent just not a messenger but the the vessel that I used came from Ireland amen and I'll tell you what folks amen the photograph I got because it was 15,000 ft high and and Cloud's don't going to sit there for an hour waiting for you to take a photograph but I got it just as it was going off the mountain like that amen I'll never forgot that all the days of my life and that was the translation the interpretation of it amen what a wonderful Supernatural you know you shouldn't be afraid of of Supernatural things our brother we in L and I I love brother way I think he's a great man of God and and way was saying sometimes hey you might be going through the church here and you might feel a little bump and you look around you think somebody bumped you said you bumped into an angel amen amen praise God that's right you can expect the Angels they're in they're in your home they're in around this they never leave this place they never leave this place praise God never do and so that's he deals with people through signs scriptural signs look uh if you've got the Holy Ghost in you then you're a candidate for the associate with the Unseen World and the supernatural if you got the Holy Ghost in you you're going to see the supernatural working amen and I love that hallelujah praise God to have that confidence that to know that God sent me Hallelujah you know brother about I mentioned that when you talk about things like that and all them years two and a half million I never I couldn't even imagine what it cost to do that but but I tell you he met the need he met the need Hallelujah and so uh when you're dealing with the supernatural praise God brother Bram said said now if your denomination sent you there they'll have to pay up he said but if God sent you there he'll take care of you that's right and it's always been that way hallelujah it's always been I've never seen a time you say have you ever been afraid when you've been never never been afraid and and and and we the same he's been in some places never had a ounce of fear about you cuz you knew God sent me he'll take care of us and he will do what he wants to do cuz you're surrendered to it amen a super amen the super saan praise God I could say more than that but my goodness a real child of God doesn't mind the weapons you know that's a good thing isn't it the chastisements For Whom the lord loves he chastises you know if you need a little slap he will give you it praise God he'll give you it put it this way he will keep you on your tose I love that you probably remember harl Hilder that was up in Canada and Edmonton and and and I preached for Harold and I said that and he loved that he said oh boy does he keep you on your toes I said that's right cuz if you think you're just going to yawn and sleep it off there you know in Pilgrims Progress uh that's what happened they were going along and the road was getting a bit rough a bit hard to walk on the next thing is uh one of them looked down and faithful or something and said hey you know down there's a path beside the road it looks easier well let's go down they started walking along this path and it was easier nice easy way and then the next thing is amen praise God a little yawn and then the next thing is they fall asleep on the easy path and the next thing they woke up and they're shaken by the big giant I got you amen who are you who you are I'm the giant Despair and you're going into the the prison o of doubting Castle you doubted God that he would take you through the Hardway amen but I've got you now and it was only that after they beat them every day and his his Wicked wife would say to the giant uh did you see them yeah did you beat them again he said I sure did amen and one day a pilgrim says I've had enough of this amen I've had enough praise God there has to be a key to this you know when he thought about it he said oh yes he said Faith's the key if we can unlock this prisoner doubt faith will unlock it for us and he unlocked it and the big jant was out there and they run away from him my goodness that's what it took to get out of giant despair so Hallelujah don't just go for the easy way sometimes God calls you on a harder way amen and and praise the Lord amen so if he's going to Chast you well just let him do it let him do it cuz he will he'll do it in love amen amen hallelujah I'll tell you a story about over in Missouri amen praise God but I won't tell you today if you want to hear of it all I'll tell you if you ask me personally you know because it's not a great story amen but but Faith does work my love praise God Amen and that's it as I said about that girl that sweetness just came over us that night and I'll tell you what I was thinking Lord you know when brother Bram was up there in um what time was it I passed the church one time where the girl was playing on the piano or the organ and and the next thing is she sees one of her relations being healed and she stopped playing and that kept playing the great physician now is here the sympathizing Jesus Oh I'll tell you what folks amen that Faith Works by love and if you didn't love the people if you didn't love the people you have no business praying for them and that's God's honest truth amen hallelujah amen and so Hallelujah now as your faith is so be onto you this is not Christian Science amen Faith Works by love it's Rel they're relations and they are relations faith and love work together amen you can't have faith unless you've got love amen because your faith is in God Who is the very essence of love amen that's his divinity is and and love work together so amen any Bible believer punctuate every one of these promises of God with an amen somebody said there's about 600 in the book I don't know I never counted them but I'll tell you what when God's speaking to you and and you know that's look could I just say this as a something that you might be able to use in your own life you you may say I'm looking for direction in my life and I would say get on your knees and pray to God and ask him for one thing ask him to speak to you and that will settle it I mean that will settle it praise God it's settled I remember I was in India and this brother and sister came and they said we want you to pray for us for a child they're a married couple and and I said yes I'll be glad to do it I said but I can't promise you that God will do it but I will pray with all my heart that you get a child and so you know and I didn't realize folks some sometimes you don't realize but that this was a tough task because I found out later that neither he nor she could actually if one of them had have been all right the other one wouldn't have been but both of them weren't all right and this is going to really take something and and you know so I I prayed for them that God would give them the child and uh amen the very next morning I was there in prayer and reading the scriptures and it's I still got it not in this Bible in my last one amen and right on the Dee it happened that the next morning I was reading and it said I have heard your prayer and it just jumped out and hit me like go woo amen and I got on to the phone and I said to that girl I said here what God has said prepare the booties the child's coming hallelujah amen prepare them you can pick the the color I don't care about that you've asked for a child God has heard the prayer amen and you say what happened I'll tell you what happened they had a little son they called him Steven ex just says no Hallelujah and he's a real good boy amen and I thank God a part of that Hallelujah part of it amen so that's wonderful amen and and praise God so hallelujah amen yeah I've sworn by myself I will bless you and multiply you amen that's why I wanted it to be easier today just in the afternoon session because uh after this morning amen just to be nice and cozy to talk about these glorious things that we believe but we believe hallelujah amen and uh praise God uh you know Ronald always talked about Muhammad Ali you know and and this guy give him such a bang one day when he was boxing and the guy turned around Muhammad Ali says he turned around he said is that all you've got well I tell you what amen woo I had to say that you know like if that's all you've got you ain't got enough amen I'm going to thush you in a couple of minutes here you know so Hallelujah now you look about the devil and see what he can do as I was saying this Richard earlier that one time I was in India and and we were in a village and they had all this microphone it was so noisy 8:00 9:00 at night and I said you don't need all that amen just the people are here and just a microphone I'll talk to them and we'll preach to them but you don't need all that well somebody got offended called in the police the police arrived the next day was nearly arrested but I wasn't but I had to give over my passport but he took a copy of that and thank God that Captain was a Christian himself and he said to brother Freddy he said now if he preaches or baptizes anybody he'll be arrested and deported well I just turned around to the people when they left the police left and I didn't know what was going to happen but I said to them I said you know the lion has got me in its mouth whoa that's a bad place to be would you not agree the Lion's got you in his mouth mouth I said now we're going to find out can he close his mouth there's the killer punch there's the killer punch amen you know brother Brown was talking about the deer that deer gets the water hallelujah amen oh my my and you know something he couldn't close his mouth amen cuz he failed am amen you know why I'll tell you why he failed because a prophet said God bless your ministry in India that's the only reason he failed Hallelujah he tried to come against that and he found he couldn't do it hallelujah amen amen there's more than one person that's been put out of V there that came with a message and been sent out so just wonderful Hallelujah and and thank God we that we can take whatever he throws at us whatever snares too many dangerous toils and snares uh we've already come and it's just it's just good it's just wonderful let me see what the time is here praise God I think it's nearly time to to stop amen but it just could go on on and on you know I we love talking about the Lord you know you if you would have been I don't know what that have thought about us last night you know we're having something to eat together and we're just talking and you know and and uh I I remember being up at brother dutches one time and you

that he has hidden me in his Pavilion he has given me Grace and you if you're born again now if you're not born again you got to make it on your own right I would not want to make it on my own that's right but if I go and stand in his righteousness I'm already judged oh yes Hallelujah today the word judged us here not over there the word judged us here what brother George said is judging us either we're going to take take it and say well God that's that's what that's mine or you going to say no that wasn't for me and you know what you done one day he's going to say you turned me down yeah on October the 14th 2023 we sent a little man from I sent a little man God said I sent a little man from Ireland to come and preach to you and you turn me down oh don't do that amen don't turn him down accept him with open arms accept you with open arms they scar hands oh yes you love the Lord like brother George said this is a love affair this all love they got out in the world that's that's okay it's fil your love and it goes all the way down to to just garbage but the love of God that goape love I'm going to get to it soon or later but that agape love is what brought you right here right that's what brought you here the love of God God brought you into this world I me brother George was talking about I preached at brother Ron Spencer one time and and I told him I said we were talking about predestination I said you know predestination we look at that we know that it was a for knowledge of God so he forew you were going to be here so he was going to make sure you got here amen remember brother R said he took this one BR this one took this one to this one this one this one to get you here right now you think about the Civil War the Civil War was probably 80% brother George knows more about the Civil War more than I know about anything in this world brother George one day he said now if Sherman would have come over this way and if this one would have come I you studied that he studied the battle he just don't know their names he studied the battle all right but you take the Civil War there was 600,000 men killed or wounded in the Civil War 600,000 men that's 600,000 Generations wow if if those kids which they were young kids if they died before they had children their generation was completely cut off their seed went nowhere there was no Gene line I'm talking about natural right but somebody made it through the Civil War what about an angel that God said hey go down there and make sure that kid makes it through Gettysburg there there's 30,000 men going to die that day but you make sure that right there makes it and here comes a sniper bullet and that angel goes I believe that that's not a fairy tale you didn't get here by chance amen there's more going
