[2:40] it Lord drops Lord Jesus and goes right

[2:53] put the meaning to it Lord Jesus and we
[2:55] ask it Lord now that you'll bless the
[2:57] word we pray in your name
[3:00] I'm going read tonight we'll just uh
[3:02] kind of Jump Right In we'll go to
[3:04] Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 and and
[3:06] take a little topic uh tonight who are
[3:11] you and and Paul says these uh these
[3:16] famous words here in
[3:19] Philippians I'll just pause just a
[3:22] second to for the pages to stop
[3:26] turning I I like that we got all the
[3:28] digital things but it's it's good to
[3:30] have the oldfashioned
[3:33] pages uh we were joking that you know
[3:35] it's kind of hard to read nowadays we
[3:37] got the iPad so we can zoom in but it's
[3:39] we we get by uh so Philippians 2:5 says
[3:43] let this mind be in you which was also
[3:45] in Christ
[3:47] Jesus being in the form of God thought
[3:49] it not robbery to be of equal to be
[3:52] equal with
[3:53] God but made himself of no reputation
[3:56] and took upon him the form of a servant
[3:58] and was made in the likeness of men and
[4:01] being found in fashion as a man he
[4:03] humbled himself and became obedient to
[4:06] death even the death of the Cross God
[4:08] bless you you may be seated God bless
[4:11] the
[4:12] word and you know uh brother Brandon
[4:15] when he would preach this sermon and and
[4:17] I think Paul you know is is trying to
[4:19] frame up in our mind that he's telling
[4:21] us really he's telling us be like Christ
[4:24] God wants us to be like Christ let this
[4:27] mind be in you that and and he framing
[4:30] it up here explaining setting the scene
[4:32] for us that the the god over everything
[4:35] over the whole universe left everything
[4:38] come down humbled himself so until he
[4:40] was just a servant in the likeness of
[4:44] man of course you know to think that God
[4:46] coming down and humbling himself like us
[4:49] what what a humiliation this is this you
[4:53] know if you young people maybe not don't
[4:56] quite know humiliation yet but as you
[4:58] get older and older you begin to realize
[5:00] how humiliating the flesh is you go to
[5:03] the doctor and things and have to endure
[5:05] different things and boy it sure is
[5:07] humiliating and that's what God came
[5:09] down from glory and humiliated himself
[5:13] to be like us and being found in fashion
[5:16] as a man he humbled himself and became
[5:18] obedient to death even the death of the
[5:20] Cross so he gave up everything he gave
[5:22] up the final culmination of his life is
[5:24] that God humbled himself come down and
[5:26] died for us gave up all of his life gave
[5:29] up everything and Paul's saying you need
[5:32] to be like that now let this mind be in
[5:35] you of course now to to for our mind to
[5:38] be transformed and our mind to be
[5:40] changed that's what we were just singing
[5:42] about that as you hear the word the word
[5:44] of God is actually grabbing your mind
[5:47] and it's grabbing your thought not not
[5:49] your mind your mind and your head maybe
[5:51] we'll kind of meditate on that tonight
[5:53] but it's it's good to have it in your
[5:55] head and everything but when it drops
[5:56] down into the mind of your heart and
[5:59] becomes comes a living
[6:01] reality then you begin to think like
[6:03] Jesus then then when when bad times come
[6:07] and when troubles come it it's not so
[6:10] it's not so hard anymore because You'
[6:13] got the Faith of Christ down in your
[6:15] soul and your thinking is different and
[6:17] the way you look at things is different
[6:19] and the way you act and the way your
[6:20] nature is different now see we've got to
[6:23] act like Christ not act like Christ but
[6:26] his nature is uh we were listening on
[6:28] the Rope coming up to uh brother R was
[6:30] preaching on uh uh
[6:33] uh now I'm drawing a blank the the the
[6:36] woman that came from from from Egypt to
[6:39] to see Solomon queen of Queen of Sheba
[6:42] and and he was talking about how that we
[6:44] we act how you act shows who you are how
[6:47] you act shows your characteristics and
[6:50] uh Christ is our example of how we
[6:52] should be and brother B would say he
[6:55] said Believers should develop the same
[6:57] humble and obedient and self sacrificing
[7:00] mind that Christ exhibited from being
[7:03] God in form to humbly becoming a servant
[7:07] and accepting death on the cross and we
[7:09] know Matthew chapter 16 says if any man
[7:12] Jesus said If any man will come after me
[7:15] let him deny himself and take up his
[7:17] cross and follow me so if you want to
[7:19] get anywhere with God then you're going
[7:20] to have to die to yourself you're going
[7:22] to have to die to all your thoughts all
[7:24] of your opinions you're going to have to
[7:26] do like Moses and Paul did and just lay
[7:28] down all those things that you've been
[7:30] taught may all your intellectual
[7:32] conceptions about how things should be
[7:34] and how things should work lay it all
[7:36] down and die and and die and that's
[7:38] that's our problem really a lot of times
[7:39] is we're not we're just not willing to
[7:41] die we're not willing to face the
[7:43] consequences of dying because if you die
[7:46] if you die something's going to happen
[7:48] maybe you'll you start sobbing maybe
[7:50] your your spouse or your loved ones will
[7:52] look over you what's what's wrong with
[7:54] Mama something's happening and some
[7:56] something's taking place you die
[7:58] somebody the world will begin to look at
[8:00] you different you're going to have to go
[8:01] to work different and you're going to
[8:03] have to dress different you're going to
[8:04] have to be changed cuz dying you you got
[8:07] to die to come up in the resurrection of
[8:09] life well that's why we go down to the
[8:11] baptismal pool and we lay somebody down
[8:13] in the water because it's a top of death
[8:15] and when you come up there's a promise
[8:17] that if you've done everything right
[8:19] when you come up God is going to fill
[8:20] you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[8:22] if you've done everything right
[8:24] according to the scripture then there's
[8:25] a promise you because it's typing
[8:28] something we're I'd be being identified
[8:30] with Christ in his des and we must be
[8:33] identified with Christ in this in this
[8:36] age that we're living in there's going
[8:37] to be an identified Masterpiece how is
[8:40] it going to be identified well we're
[8:41] identified by denominational system
[8:44] identified by the church that you go to
[8:46] identify by who who what Minister you
[8:48] like and what Ministry you follow but we
[8:51] got to be identified by the word and the
[8:53] Bible is actually Christ in letter form
[8:56] now to think about that that all the
[8:58] characteristics all the nature
[8:59] everything that you would like to know
[9:01] about God that it's all bottled up in
[9:03] this Bible in the word that we read and
[9:05] so when you read it it's actually a
[9:08] supernatural book that's it's it's
[9:10] changing you so that you now have the
[9:12] same characteristics the same it's
[9:15] expressing in you those attributes that
[9:17] God thought of before the foundation of
[9:18] the world they're being expressed as you
[9:21] partake of this book and the Bible has
[9:24] got all of these is part of the Bible is
[9:26] all these characters that are in the
[9:28] Bible that are also attributes and also
[9:31] characteristics so when you read the
[9:34] Bible when you when you really read it
[9:36] not with your mind of intellectual
[9:38] conception but when you really read it
[9:40] and begin to understand it begins to
[9:42] paint a picture uh because you begin to
[9:45] identify yourself with these characters
[9:48] you begin to look at the life of Noah
[9:50] and you see how he went into the ark and
[9:52] he went into that Arc with the three
[9:54] levels and you begin to identify well it
[9:56] wasn't it wasn't me it wasn't me that
[9:58] shut the door I sealed myself in just
[10:01] like Noah didn't seal himself in it
[10:03] wasn't me that carried myself through
[10:05] all the troubles and all the trials it
[10:07] wasn't me that built oh and you begin to
[10:11] identify yourself with Elijah and with
[10:13] Moses and with Peter and Jacob and it
[10:16] become you begin to realize that these
[10:18] are not just stories but this is the
[10:21] instruction book for why I am the way
[10:24] that I am and you begin to him maybe all
[10:28] your life you wonder why do I desire the
[10:31] things that I desire why is it that I'm
[10:33] made up this way and the Bible has the
[10:36] answer for why you are the way you are
[10:39] it's your
[10:42] identification and brother will say it
[10:44] was Jesus Christ in Noah it was Jesus
[10:47] Christ in Moses it was Jesus Christ in
[10:50] David amen it was Jesus Christ in no and
[10:53] Joseph is Jesus Christ the same
[10:56] yesterday today and forever do you
[10:58] realize what a profound statement it is
[11:00] to say that he's the same yesterday
[11:02] today and forever that it was if it was
[11:05] Christ in Moses to throw himself in the
[11:07] breach and say God if you you're going
[11:09] to have to go over me if you're going to
[11:11] kill these people then that same God he
[11:14] will demonstrate himself the same way
[11:18] all the way down through the age the
[11:20] same characteristics would be
[11:22] demonstrated even now and you and I the
[11:25] same characteristics to lay down your
[11:27] life to to die for one another to to
[11:29] love and forgive the same
[11:32] characteristics will be expressed in you
[11:34] and
[11:35] I and he would say I'm sure tonight that
[11:38] we ought to find ourselves somewhere in
[11:41] some character of The Bible so that we
[11:44] would know the outcome of that character
[11:47] I know what our outcome will be now see
[11:51] see that's that's not the when you read
[11:53] the Bible it ain't just stories it's you
[11:56] it's about you it's so much about you
[11:59] you until Paul would say that the Bible
[12:01] is like a mirror that you can look in
[12:05] and you can begin to understand
[12:07] yourself begin and now now there's when
[12:09] you really begin to overcome you got to
[12:12] understand yourself if you can
[12:15] understand yourself it ain't about
[12:17] understanding the person in the seat
[12:18] next to you or understanding the person
[12:20] behind the pulpit and that's where we
[12:22] get caught up we want to understand the
[12:24] person behind the pulpit or the person
[12:25] next to us or whatever but if you can
[12:28] understand yourself
[12:30] and look into the Mir and the only way
[12:31] that you're going to really be able to
[12:34] understand yourself because there's so
[12:35] many things in the scripture about how
[12:37] man you just can't you can't you're not
[12:39] going to really know yourself just by
[12:42] self-examination or whatnot but the only
[12:45] way you can really know yourself is to
[12:47] look in the mirror of God's word brother
[12:50] br going tell this little story about
[12:52] the the little the little fellow that
[12:53] you know he said he was probably raised
[12:55] up like I was out in the middle of
[12:56] nowhere in the countryside and uh we we
[12:59] actually uh maybe I shouldn't say this
[13:02] but I know exact the exact spot where
[13:04] the cabin was and we because we always R
[13:06] ride by it going up to Kentucky and
[13:08] we've stopped and pull over to the side
[13:09] of the road many times and we we pull
[13:11] out and we look at that spot and and we
[13:13] see you know just imagine what he's
[13:16] explaining that his mama used to have
[13:18] the little broken mirror on the on the
[13:20] on the tree and and uh and and and and
[13:24] he said maybe this child was raised up
[13:26] like that that they didn't really have a
[13:27] a mirror just a little a broken sliver
[13:31] on a tree that they could go up to and
[13:32] you know Daddy would shave his face in
[13:34] that mirror and and when this little boy
[13:36] went to the city to Vis visit his
[13:38] Grandmama well the his Grandmama uh you
[13:41] know behind the door that was closed she
[13:43] had a mirror on the door and when he
[13:45] went to go exploring he he you know how
[13:48] kids do they go start going through the
[13:50] house and well let me see what's behind
[13:51] this door let me see what's over here
[13:53] and he opened the door and and there was
[13:55] a mirror and he he did he had never seen
[13:57] anything like that before so he started
[14:00] you know he wanted to go talk to the boy
[14:02] and that he could see and he got out
[14:04] real close to it and he said brother R
[14:06] said he turned around he said why why
[14:09] mama that's me now brother brand ain't
[14:12] just telling the story just for a little
[14:14] fun little story he he's telling he's
[14:17] explaining your exper you and and my
[14:20] experience when you read the Bible and
[14:22] you begin to recognize that that's me
[14:25] that I'm reading about when I'm reading
[14:27] about David crying on is bed at night
[14:29] and when I'm reading about the the Queen
[14:32] of Sheba going after wisdom and read
[14:34] about the wise men following a star and
[14:36] you read about all these stories it's
[14:38] not just stories but about it's about me
[14:41] and and there's power in these stories
[14:43] but because it's what gives you your
[14:45] identity the the word gives you identity
[14:48] and the word gives you your courage and
[14:50] your strength to know you don't get your
[14:52] identity from your mama or your
[14:53] granddaddy or what somebody said about
[14:55] you but you get your identity from the
[14:57] word of God when you begin to identify
[14:59] yourself with what the scripture says
[15:01] and he said that's what we want to look
[15:03] at tonight I I want to look at me and
[15:06] now look how he's saying I want to look
[15:08] at me amen I don't want to look at you I
[15:12] want to look at me amen and I want you
[15:15] to look at yourself is what he said
[15:17] that's a quote I want you to look at
[15:20] yourself and I want me to look at me
[15:24] amen he said I want to see myself and
[15:26] God's looking glass cuz if anything will
[15:29] show you where you're standing it's this
[15:31] book there is no book like it CU it is
[15:34] all
[15:36] truth
[15:38] amen this mirror it it shows us
[15:42] ourselves now you know you know the
[15:44] Christ Christian business is really a a
[15:47] lonely a lonely business it's something
[15:49] that you really and and and this kind of
[15:52] stum stumbles us sometimes we want
[15:54] somebody to help us get out of our
[15:55] predicament but you know in the greatest
[15:57] battle ever fought brother told us that
[15:59] that's right you got to get out of your
[16:01] egg shell on your own so many times we
[16:04] want to you know blame somebody else for
[16:06] not getting us out of our predicament or
[16:08] put the responsibility on somebody else
[16:10] but it's it's really us it's up to us
[16:13] it's up to you to look into the mirror
[16:14] of God's word cuz the only the only one
[16:16] you can't help a little chick get out of
[16:18] an egg it's up to the EG the little
[16:20] chick to hatch their way out of the egg
[16:22] by speaking but with their mouth by you
[16:25] know a Christian gets out of the egg by
[16:27] speaking the word and you just keep
[16:30] pecking and pecking until you get out by
[16:33] yourself and so the mirror is to show us
[16:36] ourselves amen it's not to show us one
[16:39] another right it's not to so we can look
[16:41] at one another and you know so many
[16:43] times I've down through now we know all
[16:46] all down through our Christian Journey
[16:48] we've we've stumbled and seen one
[16:49] another you different people poke at one
[16:52] another and say horrible things and what
[16:54] I'm talking about tonight though is
[16:55] identity that people will say sometimes
[16:58] horrible things about one another
[17:00] they'll label one another people will
[17:01] say you're a charismatic or fundamental
[17:03] or a Pentecostal or whatever but that's
[17:05] not where you get your identity from
[17:08] people people will put labels on you out
[17:10] of the Bible and say all kind of stff
[17:12] I've heard people say you know what I
[17:13] don't even think that person's born
[17:14] again I well listen that person over
[17:16] there is stupid or say horrible things
[17:18] about what but you know maybe your
[17:20] parents have said those things about you
[17:23] but you see that's not where you get
[17:24] your identity it's from things that
[17:26] people say about you you get your ident
[17:29] from what the word says about you but
[17:31] can I just stop and say for just a
[17:33] moment that if we if we get caught up
[17:35] and saying and labeling one another and
[17:37] then those kind of things see what Jesus
[17:39] said about it he said I say unto you
[17:41] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[17:44] without a cause shall be in danger of
[17:46] the judgment and whosoever shall say to
[17:49] his brother Rocka shall be in danger of
[17:51] the counsel you'll be in danger of being
[17:53] hauled in front of the counsil but
[17:55] whosoever shall say thou fool sh shall
[17:58] be be in danger of Hell
[18:01] file you know what thou fool means this
[18:03] it means like calling somebody
[18:05] spiritually worth worthless before God
[18:08] you realize what what a horrible thing
[18:10] to say to say about another Christian
[18:12] person where that person there's just no
[18:13] value in them and what what what Jesus
[18:16] was saying is if to do something like
[18:18] that to make an accus that fool is to is
[18:21] is to put yourself in danger of Hellfire
[18:23] while because it exposes that there
[18:25] might be some character flaws there to
[18:27] look at another brother and say well I
[18:29] don't even think that person is born
[18:31] again now now we got to balance it out
[18:33] there because you know brother brandham
[18:34] even in some places he said I questioned
[18:36] that sister's experience now we balance
[18:38] it out but we're not curling accusations
[18:41] and things like that and and say calling
[18:43] our brothers worthless and things like
[18:45] that but to call your brother
[18:47] unregenerate or or whatever you look the
[18:50] point I'm trying to make tonight is
[18:52] you're are not identified by a label
[18:54] that someone else gives you you're
[18:56] identified by that look what brother R
[18:58] said he said don't say nothing about
[19:00] Christians maybe some of them don't live
[19:02] just right or do just right but that's
[19:05] God's child let the father take care of
[19:07] his own kitties you know if we go to
[19:09] fight one another God give us both women
[19:11] maybe so let's just leave the other fell
[19:14] alone and pray for him try to love him
[19:16] and correct him and maybe God will help
[19:19] him God wants us to use the word is our
[19:22] mirror step up to the mirror like that
[19:25] little boy there in that room when he
[19:26] flipped the door around and look in that
[19:28] mirror here and begin to identify and
[19:30] and do what remember as we get older we
[19:32] look in the mirror we see all the bags
[19:34] under our eyes and the wrinkles and
[19:36] things and we start remembering I
[19:37] remember when I got married I remember
[19:40] when I met my wife I remember all these
[19:43] things and when you look into the word
[19:44] of God you begin to remember just like
[19:46] the children of Israel did when they
[19:47] went up to the river the the River
[19:49] Jordan and they looked at those stones
[19:51] that had been piled up they begin to re
[19:52] remember what God had brought them
[19:54] through maybe we could do that tonight
[19:56] as we look into the word of God remember
[19:58] where God has brought you through
[20:00] remember what he's done for you and be
[20:02] reminded that if he if he was there then
[20:04] he's still the same today he's still
[20:07] with you today and and what's happening
[20:09] is in in second Corinthians Paul
[20:11] explained that we are with open face
[20:14] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[20:17] Lord are changed into the same image
[20:21] from glory to glory even as by the
[20:24] spirit of the Lord we're being changed
[20:27] as we look into this mirror of God's
[20:28] word
[20:29] amen now aren't you glad that you don't
[20:32] have to stay the
[20:33] same aren't you glad that you don't have
[20:35] to stay all right like the the cocko bur
[20:38] that we the other day brother random was
[20:41] saying that as before the service that
[20:43] God can change you from a cockabur to a
[20:45] grain of wheat that God can change you
[20:48] from the way that you used to be to the
[20:49] way that now well to to to be like
[20:52] Christ and it's good to know who you are
[20:54] who you are as a church and that's the
[20:57] question we're asking tonight who are
[20:59] you it's good to know who you are am who
[21:02] are you as a church who are you as a
[21:06] people who are you as an
[21:09] individual we can never rightly be able
[21:12] to have faith until positionally we know
[21:15] what we are amen now that's something is
[21:18] it that you you got to know who you are
[21:20] in order to have faith
[21:22] amen not just because somebody told you
[21:26] like like for example preacher could
[21:29] stand behind the P Pulpit all day long
[21:30] and tell you you're the you're the
[21:33] manifested uh son of man for this age
[21:36] you're you're this you're that and it'll
[21:38] just go in your head and it's good
[21:41] intellectual learning but you really
[21:44] identify Yourself by
[21:46] Revelation and that begins to change
[21:48] things not you're not looking by mental
[21:50] Faith anymore but you're looking by
[21:52] Revelation that's what we're that's what
[21:53] that's the target we're trying to
[21:55] achieve we got to know who we are and
[21:58] order to have faith cuz when you know
[22:01] who you are then you begin to look at
[22:03] things different and Jesus gave us the
[22:05] example of what we ought to be looking
[22:06] at when he reflected his life to us
[22:08] through the word what we should see when
[22:10] we look into God's mirror brother R said
[22:12] we should see our s identified with him
[22:15] that is a perfect example and who you
[22:18] are actually manifests as we're being
[22:21] changed in your character because your
[22:24] character is who you are amen he said we
[22:27] find out that as we go along through
[22:29] life that our character molds the image
[22:31] that we are each one knows that you as
[22:34] you live so is your character molds you
[22:38] to what you are along and along things
[22:42] begin to change you look back and see
[22:45] that you're different and now you're
[22:47] like maybe that eagle in the chicken
[22:49] yard you you think about that eagle in
[22:51] the chicken yard looking around for
[22:53] years and thinking something was wrong
[22:56] with him
[22:59] that eagle in the chicken yard looking
[23:00] around and and maybe all the other
[23:02] chickens were telling him something's
[23:04] wrong with
[23:06] you all the other chickens and look at
[23:08] the nature the characteristics of the
[23:10] chicken characteristics of the chicken
[23:12] is to find a little flaw and to keep
[23:14] pecking at it have a pecking order so
[23:16] somebody's above you and you're above
[23:18] somebody else and have all the all the
[23:20] characteristics of a chicken but that
[23:23] eagle I just don't like that something's
[23:27] different about the eagle yeah and one
[23:29] day he heard Mama scream and he began to
[23:32] realize why cuz he began to identify
[23:35] with himself with that mother eagle
[23:38] flying above and begin to realize I I
[23:40] ain't a chicken now that's the story of
[23:43] every believer you begin to you you're
[23:45] an oddball you're set in this world and
[23:47] something's different about your nature
[23:49] and and and you go along and you you
[23:51] don't understand why there's something
[23:53] in you hungering and crying for God like
[23:56] that duck that's crying out I I and that
[23:58] that duck in the chicken yard that that
[24:00] that knows he's craving something but he
[24:02] don't know what it is until finally he
[24:03] gets a whiff of water and the the water
[24:06] is the thing that he's been craving for
[24:07] all his life well that there there's the
[24:09] explanation for for why I am the way I
[24:12] am thank God tonight that we can say
[24:14] that you ain't a chicken you're an eagle
[24:17] you can you can spread your wings not
[24:20] not by your own power but have
[24:22] confidence and the Winds of faith that
[24:23] can lift you up up up into the
[24:25] heavenlies that you ain't you ain't a
[24:28] chi and your identity comes from the
[24:30] word you know an eagle an eagle in the
[24:32] Barnard ain't got nothing to
[24:34] prove an eagle all he's got to do is
[24:36] just have faith and hop up on that fence
[24:39] Po and look look heavenward to where is
[24:41] to to where he come from and spread
[24:43] those wings and fly Heaven an eagle
[24:45] ain't got nothing to prove to nobody so
[24:48] you know just be genuine whatever you
[24:50] are just be real because you you don't
[24:53] have to prove anything if you're a real
[24:55] genuine Born Again believer it's going
[24:57] to manifest and the real genuine
[25:00] character you don't have to be something
[25:02] that you're not amen and that's where
[25:05] you know that's where complexes come
[25:07] from complex has come from that you know
[25:10] you you feel you got that feeling of
[25:12] inadequacy or Pride or or you got a need
[25:15] a special need to compensate maybe
[25:18] because your parents put you down or or
[25:20] they didn't never really treat you right
[25:22] or your your your family always put you
[25:25] maybe in a corner or something and
[25:26] didn't really and now you feel like
[25:28] you've got something to prove maybe like
[25:31] that eagle in the barnyard maybe that
[25:33] eagle had a complex for a while we could
[25:35] say it like that until he realized
[25:37] realized what he was oh an eagle an
[25:40] eagle has no need of a complex if you
[25:44] know where you come from you don't have
[25:46] to prove nothing to nobody you don't
[25:48] have to put on a show you don't have to
[25:50] be like a crow that's putting peacock
[25:53] feathers in to prove that he's something
[25:55] that he's not oh just be real genuine
[25:58] church that's what God wants us to be
[26:00] that's why that's why God wants
[26:02] preachers to preach the way that they
[26:04] preach not to try to preach like
[26:05] somebody else but to preach the way that
[26:08] they that God has put them in the church
[26:09] to preach and he wants singers to be
[26:12] genuine enough to sing the way that God
[26:14] wants them to sing and not try to act
[26:16] like somebody else but just to be real
[26:18] genuine and be a real have confidence in
[26:21] what God has made you to be
[26:29] and Eagle's Got Confidence in his wing W
[26:31] in The Winds of faith and his wings of
[26:33] that Old and New Testament oh I got to
[26:36] meditating on complexes the other night
[26:38] and you you know there's so many things
[26:40] that can cause
[26:42] complexes I was I was looking at my kids
[26:44] and I and I
[26:47] think you know there's I got four kids
[26:50] and if you don't know that they're all
[26:52] sitting there and and and you know I I I
[26:54] got to thinking you know there's so many
[26:55] things that I could do wrong as I'm
[26:57] raising and my children that could
[26:59] actually instill instill something that
[27:01] they'd have to do get over the rest of
[27:03] their life right amen and I tell you I
[27:06] began to meditate on how God you know
[27:08] when God God has all of us children and
[27:10] he doesn't have any any
[27:13] favors we're all the same in his sight
[27:17] and I I have to say tonight that I think
[27:19] that's one thing that can really harm
[27:21] your children is when you begin to
[27:22] elevate one or the other and you put one
[27:24] up up and one down and then the whole
[27:27] rest of their life
[27:28] they're struggling with a complex
[27:30] because they're trying to wonder why
[27:32] does mama and daddy prefer this one over
[27:35] this one why does mama and daddy like
[27:38] this child over me why is Mom and Daddy
[27:40] giving all these gifts and things to
[27:41] this child and not this child why why do
[27:45] my parents that are supposed to love and
[27:47] be there for all of my children why are
[27:49] they preferring this one over that one
[27:51] and then the rest of their life they're
[27:52] struggling why why can't I go to
[27:54] holidays when the other kids can't why
[27:56] can't I do why don't I get presents like
[27:58] the other kids do for Christmas why
[28:00] don't I get this and and then the rest
[28:02] of their life they got to deal with a
[28:04] complex that maybe just their upbringing
[28:07] put on them now you know maybe you think
[28:09] tonight I'm talking about the children
[28:11] but there's a lot of adults sitting here
[28:13] tonight that maybe have been in that
[28:15] same situation where just growing up
[28:17] being in your environments you you
[28:19] didn't get treated maybe with the way
[28:21] that maybe you should have and it puts a
[28:24] complex on you because now you're trying
[28:26] to find your identity
[28:28] you're trying to find where why am I the
[28:31] way that I am what is my identity and
[28:34] you're searching for you're searching
[28:36] for something to identify yourself
[28:39] with oh you begin to look into the word
[28:41] of God and the word of God Will trump
[28:45] how you were raised you can begin to
[28:47] break those Cycles where you were
[28:49] treated wrong or your mom Mom and Daddy
[28:51] was an alcoholic or something and they
[28:53] you had to endure all that stuff that
[28:55] your mom and daddy poured out on you and
[28:57] you can begin to break out of all that
[28:59] cycle and break through because the word
[29:02] of God was given to for Liberty Liberty
[29:05] to set you that's what Jesus said there
[29:07] in the temple when he pulled the scroll
[29:08] of Isaiah off and he said the spirit of
[29:10] the Lord is on me to preach Liberty to
[29:13] the captive Liberty is what the word of
[29:15] God gives you not bondage and I tell you
[29:18] that's if you look at the nature of the
[29:20] thing you can actually watch Ministries
[29:22] and things and some Ministries will bind
[29:24] you and some Ministries will put you in
[29:26] captivity but some Ministries will set
[29:29] you free and will loose you and give you
[29:31] something you could take home with you
[29:33] that will put a spring in your step step
[29:35] and a song in your heart to know that
[29:38] God cares about you maybe when nobody
[29:40] else did maybe when your own mother and
[29:43] father didn't care for you I've seen so
[29:46] many examples of where mothers and
[29:48] fathers were harsh and hard and unloving
[29:51] and uncaring and things and they' treat
[29:53] they they they' maybe pass away and
[29:55] they'd leave a great big M bundle of
[29:57] money nether this one over here but not
[29:59] this one over here and you're wondering
[30:02] why how can I how can I deserve anything
[30:05] how can I be what I'm supposed to
[30:11] be I thank God tonight that God don't
[30:15] have favorites that's right if there's
[30:17] somebody over here getting a blessing
[30:18] you can have it too if there's somebody
[30:20] over here getting the baptism of the
[30:22] Holy Ghost you can have it too and and
[30:24] if we'll raise our family like that amen
[30:28] then you'll raise up children in the
[30:30] admonition of God not having favorites
[30:34] just loving everybody listen I'm sorry
[30:37] I'm I'm I'm going stay on this might as
[30:38] well stay on a little bit like brother
[30:40] Andrew Glover says I'm I'm here might as
[30:42] well camp
[30:47] [Applause]
[30:50] out as I watched my children develop you
[30:53] know some would would do things you're
[30:55] like I wish they wouldn't do that and
[30:57] and some you know that go through
[30:59] periods of things where some are are are
[31:01] more studious and reading the Bible and
[31:03] you'd hear the tap playing and whatnot
[31:05] but all the while they're all my
[31:08] children and just like that story of the
[31:11] prodical son that prodical son came back
[31:13] out of the pig pin and he was still the
[31:16] child and he got the robe it doesn't
[31:19] matter they're all your CH they should
[31:21] be they should all be your children and
[31:23] you should treat them all the same
[31:26] you're here you might as well receive it
[31:28] you got children God give them to you he
[31:30] laid them in your hands he laid them in
[31:32] your lap to raise you might as well
[31:34] treat them all like your
[31:37] children you know any child of God can
[31:40] claim any
[31:41] benefit any benefit you need tonight if
[31:46] you need healing if you need salvation
[31:49] it doesn't matter whether you're rich or
[31:51] poor or or whether you've been like the
[31:53] prodical son and been laid in the pig
[31:55] pin tonight you can claim it because God
[31:58] the only requirement is to believe him
[32:01] believe and you can receive what God has
[32:03] in store for you I I love this scripture
[32:06] in Psalm chapter 84 it says for the Lord
[32:09] God is a son and shield the Lord will
[32:12] give Grace and glory and no good thing
[32:15] will he withhold from them that walk
[32:18] uprightly so if you got a neede tonight
[32:20] you can claim it you don't have to look
[32:22] over at your brother or your sister and
[32:24] think well why why do they have peace
[32:27] and I can't why do they have this or
[32:29] that and I and I can't have it there
[32:31] ain't no favorites in the in the Kingdom
[32:33] of Heaven you can have it if you can
[32:35] just believe it
[32:37] amen that's right our identity is in the
[32:40] word many times you know the devil will
[32:42] come and he'll influence how people look
[32:44] at
[32:45] you that's what we're talking about
[32:47] tonight you can get so down by what
[32:50] somebody else thinks or feels about
[32:53] you and that's the the devil the devil
[32:55] will come and he'll distort things and
[32:57] something you didn't even mean to do
[32:58] he'll bend it around in their head and
[33:00] before long they're upset with you and
[33:02] that you're upset with them and and it's
[33:04] just all the devil creating Discord and
[33:06] and you know what you can start
[33:07] listening to things that people say
[33:09] about you and I like I was saying that I
[33:11] don't even think that they're born again
[33:13] I don't think I think there's something
[33:15] wrong with that person and it begins to
[33:17] pray on your identity what is it it's
[33:19] the devil and what I'm talking about
[33:21] tonight is how to combat the devil how
[33:24] do you combat the devil is the same way
[33:26] Jesus did when he he stood there all the
[33:28] power in heaven veiled in that
[33:30] Tabernacle and he didn't use none of it
[33:32] he didn't call down angels from heaven
[33:34] but he combed the Devil by the word and
[33:38] that's how you're going to combat the
[33:39] devil when somebody calls you a label or
[33:41] something you don't like you don't have
[33:43] to accept it you can respond like that
[33:45] eagle did with the little squirrel was
[33:47] yapping away well I know where I come
[33:50] from because I've got an identity that
[33:52] come oh I God thought about me before
[33:55] the foundation of the world and I know
[33:56] where I come from when I know where I'm
[33:58] going and it doesn't matter what anybody
[34:00] says about me listen as a Believer you
[34:03] got to know who you are cuz that gives
[34:06] you power it gives you faith if you
[34:08] don't know who you are then you can't
[34:10] properly
[34:12] believe it's see it's the devil's job to
[34:15] identify this message is wrong
[34:17] everywhere you look on the internet the
[34:19] the devil's doing his job to make this
[34:21] devil look that this message look fake
[34:23] and make it look wrong and my wife and I
[34:26] were looking on on Facebook earlier
[34:27] today there's this big thread where
[34:28] somebody's trashing a preacher and and
[34:31] just running him through the mud and the
[34:33] devil's the devil's doing his job and if
[34:36] you don't know what you are and if you
[34:39] don't know what this message is then you
[34:42] will fall to
[34:44] that you got to know that it's right by
[34:47] the scripture and you got to know that
[34:49] you are right by the scripture don't let
[34:52] the devil identify you amen you got to
[34:55] know who you are yes sir amen that's it
[34:58] what I'm talking about tonight is you
[35:00] got to know when you got the Hol when
[35:01] did you get the Holy Ghost let's ask
[35:03] this question tonight sir when did you
[35:05] get it when did when did a a a personal
[35:09] transformation in your life begin to
[35:12] begin to work when did you experience a
[35:14] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[35:17] amen did you ever you got to know
[35:20] brother I I know where I was when I got
[35:22] it amen I remember where I was and and
[35:25] it wasn't just a little hope so maybe
[35:27] something I I know that I I'm identified
[35:30] with the explanation that that was given
[35:32] in the book of Acts and I'm identified
[35:34] with the explanation that brother random
[35:36] gave can you say the same thing I know
[35:39] the effect that it had on my life you
[35:42] got to know in John chapter 14 he said
[35:45] yet a little while and the world seeth
[35:47] me no more but ye see me because I live
[35:49] ye shall live also at that day ye shall
[35:52] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[35:56] and I in you
[35:58] you got to
[35:59] know he said you'll know at that day you
[36:03] shall
[36:04] know and the word will identify itself
[36:07] amen now to think about let's meditate
[36:10] on that we're at the top of the hour
[36:12] when everybody starts getting drowsy
[36:15] let's get let's get over the the hump in
[36:17] the middle of
[36:18] sermon you got to the word when the word
[36:21] begins is birthed in you and begins to
[36:23] grow and form like looking in that
[36:26] mirror you begin to be
[36:28] changed changed and then the word begins
[36:31] to identify
[36:33] Itself by its nature right now that's
[36:37] how you can identify God is identified
[36:39] by his
[36:41] characteristics you you say well I got
[36:43] all the
[36:44] doctrine but is the life actually
[36:47] manifested because the identification in
[36:50] this end time is the token life the
[36:54] token has to be manifest and visible
[36:58] that's why brother R preached it's got
[36:59] to be visible it can't just be something
[37:01] that's hidden away but it's got to be
[37:03] visible and he said now listen he listen
[37:06] how he framed it he said we also the
[37:07] Christian Church itself which is of no
[37:10] denomination but of a
[37:12] nature the Christian church is not of a
[37:15] denomination right brother but it's of a
[37:17] nature all throughout the world there's
[37:20] different denominations but we've been
[37:22] called out of a denomination to have the
[37:24] nature of Christ and that now that's why
[37:28] the Holy Ghost let's define what the
[37:29] Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is not a
[37:31] Doctrine or theology no where where
[37:34] you've stacked up all the firewood or
[37:36] you got the nice chromed up car sitting
[37:39] in the driveway you've got the mechanics
[37:42] but that is not the Holy Ghost the Holy
[37:45] Ghost is a person amen and that's why
[37:48] when God gives you the Holy Ghost he
[37:51] will manifest his characteristics in you
[37:54] you will not just know about it but it
[37:57] will be living in you you will be the
[38:01] walking living manifestation of Christ
[38:04] now not all at first because it's a
[38:06] growth development process but Christ
[38:08] will slowly o and surely over time
[38:11] transform you until you have the
[38:14] characteristics of the person Jesus
[38:17] Christ the same yesterday today and if
[38:19] you think tonight that we've got all
[38:21] around the world we've got brothers and
[38:23] sisters in Nicaragua and Honduras and
[38:27] Sweden and Switzerland and the
[38:29] Philippines all around the world that
[38:32] have that same
[38:34] nature the nature of almighty
[38:38] God that nature of almighty God in
[38:40] Africa will make a woman cover herself
[38:43] when she gets filled with the Holy Ghost
[38:45] that nature in Nicaragua will do the
[38:47] same thing that nature in America will
[38:49] make you act the same way because it's
[38:52] the nature the nature of God in you and
[38:55] brother R would say when you're a
[38:57] Christian in your nature is a Christian
[38:59] you don't have to say you can't smoke
[39:01] you can't drink you can't do this you
[39:03] don't have to say that amen they just
[39:06] don't do it anyhow see their nature is
[39:10] different the spirit of Christ is in the
[39:12] person and Christ don't do those things
[39:15] see you say you have to love the Lord
[39:17] you ought to go to church you don't have
[39:18] to tell them people that they go anyhow
[39:22] they'll walk through rain see they'll
[39:24] walk through rain in Nicaragua but they
[39:26] don't do it in America know it's the
[39:28] same nature in a born again Christian
[39:31] they'll go they'll do whatever they got
[39:32] to do to get to the word of God CU it's
[39:35] the nature and he said that's what's the
[39:37] matter with the Pentecostal church today
[39:39] it's soring and puffing and enough
[39:41] temper to fight a buzs saw and then
[39:43] wonder what went with the Holy Ghost
[39:45] back fightings and fightings and
[39:47] everything else amongst the Christian
[39:48] church I wonder where went the Holy
[39:51] Ghost he said another place why don't
[39:53] you want to be a miserable why do you
[39:55] want to be a miserable decrep ungodly
[39:58] Crow for when you could be a dove
[40:00] certainly you just have to have your
[40:02] nature changed and you change your
[40:05] nature become a son and daughter of God
[40:08] be at peace with God now to think that
[40:11] God can change your nature from an old s
[40:13] pig that likes to roll around in the mud
[40:15] and change that nature to where you're a
[40:18] dove that that you can't stand the
[40:20] things of the world it's a nature change
[40:22] something on the inside
[40:25] changed that's why it it's not just oh
[40:28] we're not just trying the conclusion of
[40:30] the matter is not to get you to
[40:31] doctrines and theology where we can
[40:34] whiteboard things and diagram things but
[40:36] the conclusion of the matter is a
[40:39] transformed
[40:43] nature in other words a living consuming
[40:49] fire you know before the day of
[40:51] Pentecost they had been taught by Jesus
[40:53] for three and a half
[40:54] years but the fire of God fell on the of
[40:57] Pentecost and it consumed all of their
[41:00] old past all of their old nature all
[41:03] their thoughts and it changed them it
[41:06] takes fire fire consuming fire to make
[41:10] this word lives in other words it takes
[41:12] more than just sticks sticks is not the
[41:15] ultimate goal it takes more than just
[41:17] sticks stacked up on the side over there
[41:20] but it's it's got to be on fire I'm
[41:23] reminded of how John Wesley said if I if
[41:25] I could just be on fire then then the
[41:27] whole world will come and watch me burn
[41:29] and you know that's how to transform
[41:31] your home that's try to transform your
[41:33] work is get on fire for God let let God
[41:36] get a hold of you until you're just a
[41:38] flaming Ember and then then everybody
[41:41] will come brother BR said they won't
[41:43] read their Bible but they they'll look
[41:45] at you they'll look at your life they'll
[41:47] look at you cause you're on fire for the
[41:49] gospel oh that's what I want my life to
[41:51] be lived I want to be so on fire until
[41:55] until there's nothing left to me but J
[41:57] Jesus Christ that's what Jesus said in
[41:59] John chapter 4 when we was talking to
[42:01] the woman at the well he said God is a
[42:03] spirit it's got to be the spirit of God
[42:06] moving in the church to make the word
[42:09] live God is a spirit and they that
[42:11] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[42:14] and in
[42:16] truth brother Adam said it won't take
[42:18] just ordinary study and thinking to make
[42:20] this book
[42:23] real maybe time sometimes we go down
[42:25] that road if I just study study long
[42:29] enough I know I've been down that road
[42:31] before if I study and study and study
[42:34] but but that's not it it's not you can
[42:37] study and study and study like Solomon
[42:40] said until it's just becomes a weariness
[42:41] to the flesh but when the spirit comes
[42:44] in the spirit will give the real hidden
[42:47] meaning to it he said it's going to take
[42:50] the operation of the Holy Ghost that
[42:52] means this book can't be revealed to
[42:54] anyone but a special class of people
[42:57] amen it will take one with prophetic
[43:00] Insight it will require the ability to
[43:03] hear from God you hearing from God is
[43:07] it's like reading the Bible and and you
[43:08] begin to identify yourself with the
[43:12] scripture you know you know when you
[43:14] when you preach the word something
[43:15] that's Supernatural is actually
[43:17] happening AB the words are going forth
[43:20] but yet so many people don't actually
[43:22] hear from God but some do right the word
[43:26] is going forth and God speaks to hearts
[43:28] and and then others it's like it just
[43:31] goes right by and they don't hear but if
[43:33] God can reveal it to you that's what
[43:35] he's talking about it will take the re
[43:37] it will require the ability to hear from
[43:39] God Supernatural instruction brother R
[43:42] said the biggest part of our faith is
[43:44] mental
[43:45] Faith by hearing the word it brings us
[43:47] to a mental recognition of God but if
[43:50] this coming from above oh brother if it
[43:55] ever strikes this yeah
[43:57] there is a Godly spiritual Faith then
[44:01] what does that Faith do that Faith
[44:05] recognizes only the word do you realize
[44:08] why we we can't just rely on a mental
[44:11] conception of the message because when
[44:13] bad things happen when your family gets
[44:16] sick when cancer strikes that mental
[44:18] faith can only go so far but when it's a
[44:21] supernatural Faith Supernatural faith
[44:23] can speak to a mountain and the mountain
[44:25] will move Supernatural faith can speak
[44:27] to a fig tree and something will happen
[44:30] Supernatural Faith knows how to
[44:31] withstand all the obstacles Supernatural
[44:33] faith can go to prayer for your children
[44:36] and something will happen in their lives
[44:38] or your family Supernatural faith when
[44:40] you know that there's a God that will
[44:42] listen and you have been identified with
[44:45] the word and it's not just something
[44:47] that you learned about it's not just
[44:49] sticks that you stacked up to the side
[44:51] and and just sticks laying on your shelf
[44:54] but it's a consuming fire that has made
[44:56] it real that's what I want a real
[44:59] Supernatural Faith living in my life oh
[45:02] Moses had been taught all those years
[45:04] down in Egypt by his mama it was just
[45:07] sticks until he came to a burning bush
[45:09] and he met a consuming fire tonight have
[45:12] you met the consuming fire or is it just
[45:14] sticks to you but sure it's going to be
[45:16] sticks at first it's going to be just
[45:18] stacked up stacked up over to the side
[45:21] and your mental Faith but that's not the
[45:23] end of the story it's got to be real
[45:26] it's got to be a real Revelation
[45:28] something that will change your life
[45:31] transform your
[45:34] life mental Faith can't do anything it's
[45:36] just limited frail and weak but a
[45:39] spiritual revelation will move
[45:41] mountains you know there's there's even
[45:43] time you know you go to church services
[45:45] sometimes and different places and
[45:47] there's times you hear things and and
[45:48] it's the word of God but it's put
[45:51] together
[45:52] intellectually and if you put it to
[45:54] intellectually if you put it together
[45:56] intellectually it'll always lead you to
[45:58] an intellectual conclusion usually the
[46:01] intellectual conclusion is look how much
[46:02] I know wow look how much I got stacked
[46:05] up look at all this knowledge that I've
[46:07] got and intellectual conclusions
[46:09] introduce human nature why because it's
[46:12] come from your human nature it's come
[46:14] from from your mind it didn't come from
[46:15] a spiritual Revelation but it was put
[46:17] put together intellectually and Human
[46:19] Nature has all these weaknesses and fear
[46:22] is one of those weaknesses and the
[46:24] moment you start depending on your own
[46:26] ability my mind my I'm depending on how
[46:29] much I know and my own intellectual
[46:31] ability then now you've got the element
[46:33] of fear what if it doesn't work what if
[46:36] what if I can't do it anymore what if it
[46:38] just won't work what if I don't work cuz
[46:40] you're depending on your own self
[46:42] instead of something Supernatural and
[46:44] the element of fear is that thing that
[46:46] needed if someone's going to control
[46:48] your life and you'll find as you as you
[46:51] go through life that every false prophet
[46:53] is going to have an element of fear so
[46:55] that they can take control over you and
[46:58] that is a characteristic of nanism that
[47:01] wants to detail every element of your
[47:03] life so they got you doing what they
[47:05] want how they want when they want they
[47:07] got you controlled and you'll find out
[47:09] that that nianis spirit that brother R
[47:12] talked about in the first church ages
[47:14] the first three Church Ages was all
[47:16] about control it's controlling by an
[47:18] intellectual element that doesn't come
[47:21] by faith but Jesus but but Paul told
[47:23] Timothy God ha not given us the spirit
[47:26] of fear
[47:27] that's why that's why the preaching of
[47:29] the Gospel by Revelation by real
[47:31] Supernatural Revelation does not bring
[47:34] fear it is not control but it sets
[47:36] Liberty it
[47:38] sets it brings you to a place where
[47:41] you're not bound by those things that
[47:43] your mother and father told you it
[47:45] brings you to a place that you're not
[47:46] bound by something that maybe maybe a
[47:48] minister years ago told and set you into
[47:51] a place of bondage but it loses
[47:54] you Revelation by the spirit is
[47:58] Revelation by the spirit is what will
[47:59] take us in the
[48:04] Rapture our God is a consuming
[48:07] fire and you know what fire does it
[48:09] creates an
[48:11] atmosphere y'all doing all right you're
[48:13] not y'all if y'all get tired on me and
[48:15] draw back I might I might
[48:18] stop fire creates an atmosphere you know
[48:22] everybody's got a nature and everybody's
[48:25] nature creates an atmosphere
[48:27] I I found that quote I didn't have it in
[48:29] my notes but but uh you can go look at
[48:31] it on Facebook where brother R was
[48:33] asking the question what would it have
[48:34] been like to just sit and listen to
[48:36] Jesus and that atmosphere that he
[48:38] created that of of of Godly fear and and
[48:42] the other things that he said love and
[48:44] and so forth that when you would sit
[48:46] around Jesus that it just that
[48:48] atmosphere why because fire is going to
[48:52] create an atmosphere you you know you
[48:54] can't get warned by painted fire you
[48:57] can't get wor warned by just a mental
[48:59] intellectual conception uh of the words
[49:02] laying there on the page but when a
[49:04] consuming fire comes and sets it a blaze
[49:07] then there's something that you can get
[49:08] warmed by and a fire creates an
[49:11] atmosphere I I we got a picture that we
[49:13] like to look at years ago when we we we
[49:16] had the wood stove going downstairs in a
[49:18] cold winter and and all the kids were
[49:20] sitting around you know playing their
[49:21] little games and and that fire that wood
[49:24] stove set the atmosphere for the whole
[49:26] room
[49:27] and probably the kids wouldn't have even
[49:29] been in that room if it wasn't for the
[49:31] wood stove that was warming up the whole
[49:34] place heating up the walls and and
[49:36] that's what fire does is it just it just
[49:38] it it draws everybody to the thing and
[49:41] brother R would say now you have seen
[49:43] people that you just love to be around
[49:45] yet they might not exactly be in your
[49:47] bracket of society and again they might
[49:50] be of A different race the colored or
[49:52] the brown or the yellow but there just
[49:54] something about that character that you
[49:56] just love to be in their presence and
[49:58] you put out an atmosphere he said
[50:01] because each person is a little Dynamo
[50:02] of their own what is it it's the nature
[50:05] the nature of Christ that's right being
[50:07] put out the nature of Christ now I want
[50:11] to remind you you'll never really know
[50:13] if you're putting out the nature of
[50:14] Christ until you can identify yourself
[50:16] in the word you're you're not going to
[50:18] be able to know if you're putting out
[50:19] the nature of Christ by reading romance
[50:21] novels and and watching movies and
[50:24] figuring out whether you like Spider-Man
[50:25] or Superman better but you look into the
[50:28] word of God and you begin to identify
[50:29] yourself with that and begin to see that
[50:31] you match up with it that's that's the
[50:34] shest evidence like that eagle that
[50:36] could look heavenward and see it see
[50:38] where he come from he said you see
[50:40] people that were noble people but yet
[50:42] you were always glad to get away from
[50:44] them it's just they create such an
[50:46] atmosphere around where you are nothing
[50:49] against them they're nice people but you
[50:51] just don't like that atmosphere and
[50:53] their character creates whatever they
[50:55] are makes them what they are now if we
[50:58] get to look at the character of Christ
[50:59] brother R said his loving character of
[51:02] love oh for us it makes plain John 3:16
[51:07] for God so loved the world that he gave
[51:09] his only begotten son that whosoever
[51:11] believeth in him should not perish but
[51:14] have eternal life what's he saying the
[51:15] character of Christ was what Paul was
[51:17] talking about there in Philippi
[51:19] Philippians uh that that that God would
[51:21] come down and humiliate himself in flesh
[51:25] to save us come all the way down and
[51:27] humble himself he said that's what he
[51:29] was that's who he was and that's why he
[51:31] was to save you he become you that you
[51:33] might become him and he said now you
[51:36] study that character a little
[51:38] bit and look then look at yourself and I
[51:42] look at
[51:43] myself you cannot no way ever produce a
[51:47] character like that only accepting that
[51:51] character in you amen and this is not
[51:55] something just to learn about the
[51:56] tonight friends that's right but it's
[51:57] something to experience it's actually
[52:00] requirement these virtues are required
[52:03] sir you know this this diagram that we
[52:05] got on the wall back behind here is is
[52:08] character it's the character of Christ
[52:10] amen that when you hear the word it
[52:12] birth verse the word in you and then
[52:14] that word starts pushing out character
[52:17] now the world can see the same meekness
[52:19] and the same virtue and the same
[52:21] knowledge and Temperance and all the way
[52:22] up until it's the same character and it
[52:25] makes you an oddball and makes you a
[52:27] different and it makes you produce and
[52:29] live the same way that's it he said if
[52:33] his sinless nature God expressed himself
[52:35] through that sinless nature it shows
[52:37] that our nature is evil and no matter
[52:40] how much we try to patch it up or how
[52:41] much we try to indument it with other
[52:43] thing things it's got to become sinless
[52:46] like his was and then God's word can
[52:49] flow through it and that don't mean
[52:51] perfection in yourself you can't be that
[52:53] but you see even our people are getting
[52:54] away from the practice of holiness
[52:57] but what what's he talking about we got
[52:58] to come to a place of
[53:00] perfection now now hang on just listen
[53:02] just for a second listen real good
[53:05] Perfection don't mean that you don't
[53:07] make no mistakes it's your character
[53:10] amen your character right what do you do
[53:13] what do you do when you offend your
[53:14] brother you you say something you
[53:17] shouldn't and he said we're going to be
[53:19] prickly all the way up to the Rapture
[53:21] yes sir you say something you shouldn't
[53:22] what's your character
[53:24] like is your character that you're going
[53:26] to go make it right say brother I
[53:28] forgive me I I done wrong or is your
[53:31] character that stubborn nature that he
[53:33] talked about that little German boy that
[53:35] was unregenerate because he didn't have
[53:36] the Holy Ghost but he was so stubborn I
[53:39] ain't going to ask forgiveness I ain't
[53:41] going to do nothing see it's your
[53:43] character it's the
[53:45] character Perfection doesn't mean
[53:47] sinless perfection in the human sense
[53:49] it's surrendering to Christ Christ is
[53:52] the one that makes us perfect perfect
[53:54] and he puts his nature in us to mold us
[53:56] and and put his own character until
[53:58] we're till we can look in the mirror and
[54:01] see what see Christ amen see Christ
[54:05] reflected back now that's what I want
[54:08] that's what I want tonight to to to not
[54:10] to look in the mirror of God's word and
[54:11] not see myself reflected back CU if I
[54:14] see myself reflected back there's
[54:16] there's something wrong I see all my own
[54:19] weaknesses all my own failings and
[54:21] things but if I could see Christ
[54:22] reflected back and you'll see Christ
[54:24] reflected back if you're identified with
[54:26] all these characters in The Bible all
[54:29] these people in the Bible all these
[54:31] stories in the Bible brother R will say
[54:34] a man can't be that in himself there's
[54:35] no way to educate him to it it it ain't
[54:39] education I'm I'm going be a good
[54:41] educated message believer but there's
[54:44] that won't do it there's no way to join
[54:46] it I'm going to be a good little
[54:48] Lula I'm going to come to church every
[54:50] Sunday and I'm going to I'm going to
[54:52] Proclaim to everybody how a good
[54:54] legalistic Lula I am
[54:56] so that I can brag about how often I
[54:58] come to church and I have a star by all
[55:01] my attendance record but there there's
[55:03] no way to join it there's no way to
[55:05] baptize it there's no way of doing it
[55:07] that he said the only way to do it is to
[55:09] kill it you got to die so that you can
[55:10] be reborn let it be born again and and
[55:14] what a new nature come in a new nature
[55:16] not that old nasty nature but but like
[55:19] Paul said a new lump with all the leaven
[55:22] taken out of your soul and then you can
[55:24] grow and start pushing out and and
[55:26] he said that's the only way kill that
[55:28] nature of yourself that you might become
[55:31] you know I I like that Story of Lazarus
[55:33] because Jesus gave Lazarus enough time
[55:35] to die and then he could go and bring
[55:38] into life sometimes we ain't died enough
[55:41] yet sometime you know tonight that we
[55:44] don't have an altar up here like the
[55:45] Romans put an altar up at the front
[55:47] where where you come and you do like the
[55:49] the old Pagan Romans and kneel at the
[55:51] altar but tonight you've got an altar in
[55:53] your heart if you'll just kneel down at
[55:56] that altar in your heart metaphorically
[55:58] speaking just lay down all your own
[56:00] desires and things say God open yourself
[56:02] up to the word of God and say God I I'm
[56:05] tired of being the way that I am I want
[56:07] you to come and live in me I want to be
[56:09] changed I'm tired I begin to realize as
[56:12] I look into the word that I'm not I'm
[56:14] not what I thought I was maybe tonight
[56:16] you begin to realize that all you've got
[56:18] is a bunch of sticks you've got the word
[56:20] maybe you've got the doctrine piled up
[56:22] but it's time to ignite the doctrine
[56:24] it's time to let it come into a blazing
[56:26] Inferno so your whole family and so your
[56:29] whole workplace can see that there is
[56:31] still Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[56:34] today and forever that he's still alive
[56:36] and well oh why don't we do like Lazarus
[56:39] and and die completely so when Jesus
[56:41] comes he can raise us up and we can be
[56:43] like Lazarus was and everywhere Lazarus
[56:46] went he was a testimony this Jesus of
[56:48] Nazareth has got to be real cuz he was
[56:51] dead he was in the grave and this person
[56:53] has come to newness of life oh then you
[56:56] you can be a living walking Bible like
[56:58] Jesus like brother R said people won't
[57:00] read the Bible so God has made you a
[57:03] Bible God has made you up now now that
[57:06] don't mean because of how much you know
[57:08] that don't mean because of the stockpile
[57:10] of information that you've got in your
[57:12] head nobody cares how much you know but
[57:15] they'll care about a risen savior in
[57:17] your life where they could see Christ
[57:20] manifested in you and signs and wonders
[57:22] following oh I I love when I go to
[57:25] different places and and people will say
[57:27] what has God done recently in your life
[57:29] and you could tell of all the things the
[57:32] miraculous things because the scripture
[57:34] says that signs and wonders will follow
[57:37] them that believe why cuz it ain't dead
[57:39] it's living it's a living reality God is
[57:42] still alive today he ain't dead in the
[57:45] grave but He's Alive walking in your
[57:47] feet using your hands and using your
[57:51] eyes and you don't have to do anything
[57:54] that's right but let him
[57:57] just let him as we stand to our feet let
[58:00] this mind be in you just let him let
[58:04] this mind be in you which was also in
[58:06] Christ Jesus I wonder tonight if we're
[58:08] willing to let him just open up our mind
[58:11] and let these words roll around take
[58:16] root yes when we let his character be in
[58:18] us then we have become Sons by having
[58:20] the mind of Christ mind which is his
[58:24] character your mind makes your character
[58:28] let the mind of Christ be in you it
[58:31] molds the character of a Son of God
[58:36] Amen I wonder tonight as the musicians
[58:40] come do you know where you come
[58:43] from do you have do you know what your
[58:46] identity
[58:48] is you know the early Christians that
[58:50] didn't care what people said about them
[58:53] they could mock them and they they they
[58:55] call Jesus B's above what do they call
[58:57] you amen call them all kind label them
[59:00] with all kind of different things right
[59:02] but they knew their
[59:04] identity regardless of all the religious
[59:06] people of the day yes sir you know
[59:09] brother R said if you know who you are
[59:11] then you become an invincible Army amen
[59:15] right why cuz the devil can't what can
[59:17] the devil say he can chatter away like a
[59:19] little squirtel right and say you're
[59:21] this you're that but if you know what
[59:24] you are right brother man because you
[59:26] identified yourself in the word the
[59:28] devil can't put nothing over on
[59:31] you Lord

[59:36] tonight
[59:38] Lord I pray Lord if there's anybody that
[59:40] doesn't know what they
[59:43] are Lord I pray that you'll speak to
[59:45] them tonight and reveal to them Lord
[59:48] that the answer lies in the pages of
[59:50] this
[59:51] Bible the answer lies in the
[59:54] word I pray God that you you'll put a
[59:56] desire in them Lord
[59:58] Jesus they'll go searching and
[1:00:02] seeking with a
[1:00:04] desperation I pray God that you'll
[1:00:06] restore a sense of desperation Lord
