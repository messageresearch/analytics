still got a few more tests and things to go through to get everything cleared up the Lord will take care of everything because we believe it and just Ephesians 1 father we thank you most of all because you are our father that way then we know who truly we are and as the prophet said there that he was no longer the son of Charles another Branham he wouldn't denying his mother and father you've just come to realize who he really was and what was taking place so we just ask you now to help us here to understand and let that understanding come to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins as we read your word Lord you come and speak to us the biggest sin that we need to be forgiven of is in any way that we would try to put our thoughts or ideas into your word and to change it to fit something we think we love you and we thank you and just have your way now and keep us in Jesus name amen we've read this enough until everybody ought to be recorded by memory I guess this should be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places where in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved you may be seated the Lord had this blessing to the reading of the word to make wood together at these these are the ones in case somebody didn't get one this morning you know a thing but I hope you you know understood what I was trying to get across this morning and as I've always said to you I don't ask anybody to believe what I say not my wife not my children or anybody I ask you to take what is being said and you know go home and pray for God to reveal it to you because I cannot reveal it in that way then you know it's up to the Lord to reveal his word but I'm not concerned because it will be revealed to those that it's supposed to be and to those that it's not supposed to be revealed to it will not and I didn't make that choosing you know uh Rabbi Rich when I believe was the one that made a statement that was outstanding on those videos that he made he said you know we didn't choose to be the people of God talking about Israel he said we didn't choose to be that he said he chose us well now I want you to get this locked into your mind this afternoon did she did Jesus choose to be God or was he God Amen did uh John the Baptist choose to be the Forerunner of the Messiah did Moses choose to you know be the one to deliver the children of Israel or was that for ordained for somebody to be and that those people wound up being that now remember in keeping your mind that we're trying to use a Point as I said that we are we are time creatures trying to understand an eternal situation that's where the trouble's at see that's that's what makes it um you know go wrong that we're trying to comprehend and to do that we must first start with this thing we call the mind the brain the mind you know and naturally that's where Satan battled that is in the mind if they were some way to take my thoughts and transmit them straight into your inner being of say the soul of the person then you wouldn't have any trouble uh comprehending what I'm trying to say and see that's the way it's always been you know God has always had to deal with the carnal mind of man that's why he said it is the enmity they're in Genesis right off you know enmity which means division but the carnal mind has always been division it's never been it runs that's why the imagination of man's mind or heart or whatever you'd read in Genesis is continually evil and uh it's always been that way because that's Satan's approach it's true that but see God has to approach the same way and and don't ask me how he gets through to speak to us you know because we're born doubters right I mean that's just their makeup we're born skeptic afraid uh you know we run around and said it's hard to get one man to believe another man that's that's just normal that's you know because that's that's the part of it but you know if we could ever get and I believe that one day when this is over with I don't believe we would just use a thought transmit to each other you know in heaven I believe we'll talk but it will be on the scale of thought transmitting because that way you won't misunderstand as we were using the other day that Jesus said to Peter some of them you know what is it to thee if John bites like home and saying went out from them not on everybody else from all the disciples that John wasn't going to die no John in his writing he said how be it he didn't say that he said what is it if it if he does see and we try to to comprehend so the only thing that I ask you to do is listen and then go back and listen over to the tapes again and you know and make sure that you get my under my point of what I'm trying to say to you all right because there's no need of me speaking unless you speak I mean I'm gonna get somebody else to speak if you're not going to listen to what I'm trying to say you know uh on that basis but you know I I have a thought in mind and a hard way to get to the thought because you can say well just go ahead and say it okay I said we were chosen than him what does that mean as I said this morning what does that mean to the human mind the human mind will translate that through the conscience and subconsciousness of the human being and we will come out to the bases of sin we were chosen by him and then we will try to divide or understand or try to you know to separate well why did he choose or or why did he choose or who did he choose or how was it done see we'll get all of that involved and then you know we won't have the right understanding and just saying what the Bible says yeah I have a lot of questions wrote down here on the back of this if I can get to them after a while I love questions myself you know I'll split it like this when were we chosen we were chosen to him when was he chosen and who done the choosing because if if we were chosen let me somebody shows right sexual somebody chose or it wouldn't have said that we were chosen in him well who's the hymn and what's it talking about see we got a lot of things to do in a long way to go and uh you you just forgive me all right we covered this morning just a little bit and I want to say it's the word to word that'll keep us into the line I believe the stage we are at now in the uh adoption is in the stage of the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God all right and in that is to try to make God known because manifest is the word to be made known so you know we try to make him known through speaking to you then he will make us known by whatever he desires to the signs of Wonders or whatever takes place it will be what he wants us to be and uh you know we're in the place of trying to get our understanding open to the scriptures to where that God can reveal that and I keep referring back to the disciples see he opened their understanding of the scriptures that didn't give them eternal life it was opening them to see that what he was going to do and had been doing and was taking place that was what was open all right but then on the day of Pentecost that was opened and the Bible would say then that even you know let's see you bring you remembers whatsoever are things I said and teach you things to come and run around City not only opened their understanding of what he had said to them right he opened their understanding of things to come all right John goes to Patmos John gets the future John goes see if you're dealing with nothing but John still it does go through that he does even teach more things than what he was actually teaching himself all right because what I want is the word to be alive right and you know for him to make it alive to us and then in doing that then we won't have to worry about anything else is the reveal word okay now let's try to pick back up where we were this morning and we ended up talking about the little drawing that I made to give us a comprehension of of a point of what I was trying to make and you know this is on the internet system and and I don't know I don't know where we could get a root you know we're doing on this I don't know but we'll read it off but to get it on the video part or if if you would take it and hold it kind of in front of it and let you know and give people a chance to read and see that well I'll just hold it up and let them see that we did make a point all right I hope it gets on the video clear it up enough to to there's some things on each side of it and then when you do you could back it up on your computer and see what it is or your internet system we make a little drawing to show that there were things that we put out eternity and then put a space in the Middle with lines calling it a beginning and then we come over into what is time all right now in that we talked about what was back in eternity we'll try to pick that part up right there and start with it we find that he was Elohim self-existing before there was a moon stars whatever anything he was self-existing all right and in him were attributes and those attributes were his thoughts and as I gave you this morning everyone called it even his nature me of what he is you know and in him with attributes to be a savior to be a Healer to be all of those things and brother Brown said and we see those things displayed but my point has always been to you he never gained attributes by coming here time never never made another attribute of God I'm on I'm only displayed those attributes of healer savior you know deliver Etc that's when we got over into what we call the time belt of doing and uh you know but we look back and we've seen that there was that God had foreknowledge all right all right we covered and don't forget I still believe what I believe about predestination what I call it I believe that God he predestinated by foreknowledge all right so for knowledge was first and foreknowledge is knowledge of what we're doing here that's four knowledge so he knew or else he's not gone he'd be like us he knew what we would do every night that would bet its own how much Tyler it would make all of those things we could go through to prove the point that you're to be able to believe it and then by his foreknowledge he could predestinate right so then he would be doing that now these are the words that's a part of him back there see attributes for knowledge predestination is back there and he could stand back there and look all the way through and see everything day every time of what it would be upon Earth and he could predetermine then what everything would be and he would predetermine it by looking at what we would accept or what we would do so that way he's not a respecter of persons and you can't condemn him you know or saying that he never gave you a choice all right but then we got down to the point here of talking about you know being chosen in him let's let's cover these others a little bit before we get back to that it's easy for us to comprehend because of Revelations what is 13 8 that our names were written in the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world you know and uh then we would have to come over here into life and we would appear and then you know we would come to a realization about our name being written in the Book of Life while we're over here in time all right so then your name would become on the book and brother random actually says your name goes on the book it's sanctification see so there's a lot about those things that we need to understand all right we talk about uh justification now justification is the word that we start off with that it's repentance for what you do and God chops off your past then the next is the part that to you know that uh it's as though you never done it which means you've done it but it was watched like clean everything was made and then you come to the place that the real you never did do it now there's justification that was back there real you never sinned right he said wait a minute they did in the garden I didn't say that and I said the real you that's right the garden is over here in time over here on this side I mean these are the things that are back dark in job we read about the sons of God you know morning Stars saying together and sons of God shouted for joy and we know that the prophet said that that was when they saw the Plan of Redemption coming into view but we don't believe in being people standing back there right you know choosing and whatsoever right through it in his mind amen all right and we think of that point and we hold that and that's fine but he did ask the question he asked Joe he said explain it to me in other words paraphrasing it all right he said Joe would you mind explaining to me where you were and what was going on and how I done what I've done please explain it when she brought around said my all mankind has tried to find that answer or where were you when this took place right I Believe by what we're talking about now we can see that not only do we have the revealed word which is the prophet said we have the devil's answer the devil's answer is the revealed word amen that is what will conquer him all right but we have the answer of to job where were we if we'll get it in the right order do you believe in pre-existence brother Dale I believe in pre-existence of almighty God but not of mortal human people because that would be the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence even you went back and said pre-existence to souls and and things like that all right now on this other side back in eternity we know that the seed our word of God come from God predestinated eternally the prophet says not the person see the human that become predestinated eternally see that's about foreknowledge but he said the word our seed come predestinated eternally from God all right now as I asked a question a moment ago did Jesus choose to be God to fulfill the word or was he God our minds will say he was God and then our conscience will say he chose something there was going to be a forerunner as I said of John the Baptist now I gave you these quotes there's no message I gave you today there was going to be a forerunner of the Lord Jesus Christ predestinated for ordained Eternal in the word the city would come so somebody had to be that did they have a choice now over here in the life that we're living it says to brother Branham Danny Henry told interpretation because of the choice that you made which is my choice a great portion of Heaven awaits for you amen so over here in time we have something to do with it uh who is it Joe Joe no wait a minute no Jonah Jonah let me get my stories right Jonah he got all and he went over and told them to destroy that place and God didn't destroy it and he sits down over that boy he has him a pity party as we call it caught him at all upset at God but God had to come down the street and they'll go out just a little bit join a few times and when he got him straightened out he could see that that was God's predestinated Eternal plan somebody had to do it man Jonah was the one that was used to do it yeah so don't never forget as I were trying to explain this morning we'll get back to it in a minute we do have something to do with life on this side even though he has chosen us we must choose him the prophet never done away with those things you see that's what we're trying in our mind to do all right brother random Christ The Mystery of God reveal 1617 right in there he said God had a plan and a purpose he said and he was going to see it achieved in other words there wasn't no way to change it it was the plan he had a purpose to unveil himself for us to understand him see then all of these things that we talk about sure they were back there but they relate over into here we say that and we'll get back to it later in another message but those who Justified he's already glorified all right that's already done that was done back in eternity but we must come down in life and come through the existence of life and then in the existence of life then we realize what glorification is talking about and then we can come to a place to be changed amen right so don't ever forget to message I preached 20 years ago I guess Brother Ray probably gave you the dates on it but I called it a series called matching pieces all right and uh because he's taking them off and putting them back into the tape form we can use here you see matching pieces to me was that whatever is was in heaven in God's mind must come to a situation upon Earth to be that amen and when God saw that the judge shall live by faith was going to strike the world the message he had Martin Luther ready to bring the message because that would be the matching pieces and when you and I come to the place that all of these this word is revealed as we were talking about this morning the fully matured word when it's finished then we've got to leave there's nowhere else to go right right all right now I want to get into this then of chosen in him in a I I want to just keep that talk how could he choose you without being a respecter person all right how can God choose you me you know we're talking to us I like that bus you know how could he choose us without being a respective person because that's been the argument of predestination over mankind you know all right now we can try to to Fathom it and it's good and don't throw it away because it's still part of the Bible that we can look at it as a foreknowledge point that he sees what choice you'll make and then he can predestinate according to the choice you made well that's now don't lose that that's that that's still good but we were we chosen in him or by him if we were chosen by him then he's a respect to a person okay so we you know we're going through the uh the process of elimination all right get rid of that one you know you multiple choice your kids taking school you know you got five you got a question that's got four answers well there's two of them ain't worth nothing they ain't even close to nothing so you just ask them two out and forget them don't even think about them right so then you got two and you got a choice between and you you got to decide from that huh now if we say that he chose me because he seen that I would choose him does that wear a mine's locked Okay click it because if we do that then it would be our choice it would not be his choice now you don't understand brother Dale he chose me because I chose him how are you gonna put it in there all right I gave you a quote yeah where is it that went on today I can find my quotes I wasn't going to use too many but look at the bottom of the page of the notes of the Gateway is off the message Jehovah Jireh number one 1964 uh 402. paragraph 11 and two listen what I'm telling you I'm going to start doing it because it's such a headache between in other words Joe and them I told you before they have to use the 2010 version of the message to make the computer systems run correct all right we're using the 99 version okay this is copied off as what you call the 99 version okay the other we'll show you little things on the side it's a 2010 version and and the Lord with it I'm going to start using that and the and 99 of the time it will be identical but there is rare occasions that they change the paragraph systems and they change the uh they'll put it up in another paragraph make different paragraphs out of it and things like that which when if I have to have a problem and I think there's a question about it I'll give you both versions all right but I will be switching over to the the uh 2010 version because it saves them trouble when uh brother Joe was gone I tried to help and Bob back there laughing because he spent the whole service the Sunday that he done it transferring it over to be able to put it on the internet okay so we will be switching over to the new version and and using that but if there's any different differential part I'll try to bring it to you and and use it that way you know if I can remember now we'd like to change the system in the office because it's still on the old all right I want to explain that because when I come up with something but see on this watch eat E11 Jehovah Jireh 1964 but one day God called him that's what made the difference when God made the call and that's the way it is to any life it takes God it isn't what you do it's what God does see you say I sought God I sought God you're mistaken no man seeks God God seeks the man see it's not you seeking God it's God seeking you Jesus said you haven't chose me that's John what 10 20 is that what it is I believe that's right let's enjoyment you haven't chose me but I chose you see so you chose before the work foundation of the world or you wasn't chose at all he just come to redeem that night now we get into the redeem one of these days too and all those names were not on the lounge book of life before the foundation of the world is it on in all whose names were not on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world is the only ones going to be there anyhow now that's you transfer that back over in your mind I double ready in other words he's saying if your name was not in the Lamb's Book of Life it won't be there because he goes on and says it but he's saying it because his literal words out of his mouth is saying life before the foundation world is the only one who's going to be there anyhow it looks like he you could make him say right there that that what that if your name wasn't in the books on once and ain't gonna I don't know what's going to be there but that's that's not what he's saying until you know that okay you were chosen him before the foundation of the world when the lamb was chosen you were chosen with him before the foundation and it went in the minute when we get the word back to end and we won't have any trouble because the word with is in John in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the trinitarians use that to show that there's two but that's incorrect the word with is perfect so is it here before the foundation of the world you're as I said last night now listen to what I'm saying and you're as I said last night an attribute of God's thinking now listen to this they that's the only way you can be eternal and only form of eternal life see and that's God okay now I want to know a little I want to ask you some questions how many gods you believe my current Living God right many forms right many ways of manifesting himself but only one God the father is not one God the son one God and the Holy Ghost one God you know three and it's not the great mystery of the god in three persons Blessed Trinity all right how many gods you believe in one true and living God all right so what we're going through here this afternoon if that doesn't hold true you come tell me how to service all right because we got to keep that straight to understand some things now listen the Bible said we were chosen in him question number one who done the children we were chosen than him so somebody chose us in him right how many of that sensible that's right we were chosen in him so somebody chose us in him all right now question number two our thought number to go with that how could it be that he doesn't have respect or person ever who this is that done to choosing right um now question number two who's the hymn right we were chosen in him so we were chosen in him who's the hymn I like to ask questions I love questions so without believing in a trinitarian concept or thought how are we going to be able to comprehend this scripture that somebody done some choosing and Jesus simply said you never chose me I chose you right Jeremiah I knew you and ordained your profit right before the world all right now we're going to comprehend then the statement that we've dangled around play with a little that gifts and callings are without repentance did you repent to get a gift or did you just get a gift you didn't repent to get a gift because the Bible will be wrong see then if you're listening and would look at the quotes I gave you along with these the quote we read you'll see that John the Baptist had nothing to do with it because he was a gift he was a fulfillment of Isaiah what 42 but he'd have to stand and introduce the Messiah let the Bible had already said there was going to be a deliverer to come down to deliver the children of Israel and God goes out and says Moses you're the one I gift you and who delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt Moses no no no the gift the god I'll be with you I'll be in you won't be able to stand for the gift is eternal I didn't make John eternal they didn't make Moses eternal May the gift eternal all right now so let's get into the godhead just a little because I said that's the the first part we had there in verse 3 would be on the godhead then somebody had to do some choosing because we were chosen in him now listen to the wording soon forgive me I don't have enough education I'm sorry so there had to be some way that somebody chose him I gave you a quote there that brother Branham said God chose him and said we were chosen in him okay God chose him and we were chosen in him huh now we've got to go back and understand the godhead and get it clear I love the way brother random would say it because it's hard for the human mind to comprehend it but sure does sound good he said in the beginning before the eternal use your human mind they're trying to figure that one out in the beginning before so you see why I put beginning in the middle all right yeah you're gonna have to help me I get to go over there you say wait a minute click over don't miss now okay I don't have no problem with that all right but there's not three gods right we don't even entertain the talk but there are many many manifestations of almighty God he manifested himself as a father he manifested himself as a son he manifested himself now as a Holy Spirit right but it's the same God right what did he do and morphe change his form now go ahead and give you a key if you listen I thought we believe we I thought we believed in Lula maybe not everywhere else but that we're the last in morphe so we're not out in the scriptures we're still right in the middle of it okay but how did forgive me because you got to use human words that God choose Christ we'll see two or three of them you know and he says you or is it like the denomination says the sun came up because the blue equal Eternal see you know we don't believe that because that wouldn't be sensible but as they say the son came up and said father let me go down no don't believe that do we all right we believe what the prophet said the prophet said you wouldn't do that we are on kids right he said so then it was necessary that almighty God come down to earth to pay the price amen said he never finished son he came himself uh-huh until he came South all right so then look at it ask me watch the choosing now it's not that he chose one to do listen he chose the way it would be done right now you see the choice God chose the way that this would take place and he chose it there is no other way I don't care what our peanut brain tries to figure out that we could do a better job of it no it can't be done so forget it you know four if I'd have been back here to help him well where was you when they laid the foundation to work me what you see is not what we look at choosing I choose this piece of paper over this piece of paper I made a choice me that's what we're looking at at the word choice or choosing God chose step over in another form to be known as logos pie word son are you with me he chose to step over in another form not another call it right another form another way to reveal himself so he chose the way he was going to reveal himself amen he was going to step over into just a human vessel now we gotta keep that till we get on down here on the other side all right he chose to step over in the form of the logos the theophany the the the the things that we use those great big words for the word and called the son of God come what else could you call it it's not God the son right right a trinitarianism he was the son of God he chose to step over in a way that he could start breaking him breaking what's that word a way that he could reveal himself he had a plan and a purpose remember that he was going to see achieved that he was going to reveal himself dude we keep on trying to get ourselves here involved too much until we get to the right place but you see then when he stepped over into word form that was his choice right and in that word form which as I said is not a human body you know not a moral not a 16 elements it was the word body right right now here's where as I said this morning see we get in there in our thoughts who is this Melchizedek brother Ryan said we buy Pastor Dion hey he stood now what do you live by I told you what I like about that Passion Play that time I've never seen it again in one because he said it's copyrighted but you know we generally look it's like just like a vapor and things of the creation you know and it's just like Let There Be military B you know this is coming to bed it's made a point that stuck with me and it just started out a voice saying let there being all at once you're stood a man a man's standing to be all right it changed scenes you know where it went to a baby crying in the cradle and that's where they started the story I shouted because you know what the man that was standing there saying let there be was the man that stood down there at 33 years of age or about 30 see that begin to perform the acts of the Lord Jesus upon the Earth well that was perfectly identical maybe they didn't even know what they're doing but I had a good time because to me see when that word form stood out there we didn't stand out there beside of him you know but if we wasn't in him now how many quotes do you want but around said if we wasn't in him if we wasn't back there in the beginning as the word we will never be the word yes to where we're at in him that's right now do you see the scripture we were chosen in him now I just a minute that means we don't have a choice the one I'm talking about don't want a choice that's right it ain't whether I've got it or not I don't did Jesus have a choice now come on get what I'm saying don't go over here in your mind run it to the Garden Lord let this past remain don't go there because he wound up saying nevertheless get it over with do we say he yielded up his desires his choice his thing that's over there that's down here in time get back here where I'm at did Jesus have a choice did you look around and pick out oh oh yeah you look like one I'll just step over in you no no I want almighty God or if you're trinitarian that Creator God was almighty God in another form our apps were trinitarians so then when he was chosen to be what he was a sealed language see you can trap me in those words see because I don't have enough education but when he was chosen to be what he was if we wasn't there in him we will never have eternal life other than God giving it to us somewhere as a foolish virgin etc etc because they're not nobody in there the ones I'm talking about is exactly what he done on the dead Pentecost you know what happened on the death Pentecost we're still looking at it as a God and a church God in the church God and a bride God willing to change the words on the death Pentecost God divided himself right right he divided himself he he put in flesh what was back there he 'll win he was chosen I was chosen in him I didn't make a choice you're still over here trying to figure out the choice get away to see what I'm talking about who was the one somebody if the Bible's right it said we were joking in him somebody done the choosing but if we were chosen in him then we were chosen in him not by him as I said you come down to four dollars and things and you look at it and you look like well I made a choice and I'd done this and I done that that's what we hear but there was never a choice Jesus never had a choice of whether he was going to be God or not he never had a choice of whether what he was going to be telling the quote you got unconditional Covenant 1954 306 and a pair of e or e 29. the Father Abraham was the first one that I know of this side of the flood that was called by grace off the page by election night God chose Abraham not because he was Abraham not because he was any good person God chose him because he was elected God did it I thought we believed that Abraham got an unconditional Covenant if you could do anything the prophet said to save yourself or not do anything he said then show me where Grace is at because Grace is unmerited favor you never done anything to get it okay look life story 1954 3-14 well we could take much time on that but just to show you that it's true Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him first so man don't seek God God seeks him God calls Men by election G for for knowledge of God now remember this is away from the Tabernacle so he's having it not get so deep with it right God seeks man God calls Men by election see for for knowledge of God like when Jesus when he was born he was the son of God he couldn't help cause he was the son of God now you wondered about my word energy I said he didn't have a choice he couldn't help when he was born he was the son of God he couldn't help because he was the son of God he was for ordained the Son of God before the world began he was the son of God and he was the woman see from the Garden of Eden that was the bruise the Serpent's head he had nothing to do with it it was already planned out amen when Moses was born he was a proper child not because he was Moses not because he had done something but because God chose him before he was born okay be of good cheer 1954 721 when Jesus he he was a Son of God all the way from the Garden of Eden to woman's seed is that right Moses when he was born he couldn't help cause he never made himself Moses when he was born he was a proper child God raised him up in John the Baptist 712 years before he was born the prophet Isaiah saw him and said he's the voice of one crying in the wilderness he had nothing to do about being the Forerunner of Christ God chose him before the foundation of the world to be the Forerunner of Christ I believe it was Jeremiah said God told Jeremiah I said before you even formed in your mother's womb I knew you had Sanctified you and ordained you a pro a prophet to the nation is that right before he was ever formed in his mother's womb see who can who taken talk and add cubit to his stature now if you're getting what I'm saying it was not Jesus a human flesh that stepped out back there in God now remember we say this is just in the garden in the mind of God but remember the mind of God is what brought all of this we see to pass so let's don't make this greater than what his mind was right he had a plan and a purpose he was going the prophet said to see it achieved okay so then God chose to just step over in another form call the Christ called the word the theophany no oh gosh the things the prophet has covered with us the Son of God as he called him see we take Son of God coming on earth 2000 years ago now the Son of God was the word the logos that came out of God whatever she's going to call it because it was God in another form called a son who is Jesus God in another form we call it son but he was God he didn't say I'm a son of God he said I'm gone unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins right so then when God stepped over in another form there's eternal life there's the word as I said a moment ago we bypass the word form Amen to stand there with him as peoples but we were in him or we will never be in him and we'll never have eternal life as a child of God now there's what we want to deal with brother Branham said we're part of him right if you ain't poor to God you don't have eternal life what does it mean to be a part of God well thy farts no you run out of parks and brother Mo say about the Apple you cut it up you're gonna run out of Parts don't do that on the death Pentecost God came down and expanded himself right there is no form called in the Old Testament except Adam Adam was called a son of God nobody else was called a son of God right was because they've lost they failed see then Jesus come to be the Son of God which was the beginning of the creation of God right that when God would come down into human flesh in the wound of a virgin and provide a body and step into that body and be almighty God standing there upon the Earth oh brother Dale you're Oneness oh I love it then this is the kind of Oneness I love because the bride's got to be the part of God to be made manifest upon the Earth and we're not another God we're not another person that new birth you have in you is God Amen in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the problem is quote when all of that is give out you want that quote when all of that of God is give out Amen in other words when all of the pieces of God go down you're going to have God completely done let around and said that godhead is not even complete without you that's right amen see I'm not talking about a bride being a second person or something something by God you know God making something buying like that it's not that it's in right right we were in God or we'll never be in God that's right when he stepped out in that word form we would have in that word form right there in him here's where it's at see when he came on Earth we came in him amen but you know what they're doing today they preach it he came in US that's not right right oh yeah I found a new bird bring it on down yeah I know what you're talking about I know what they're talking about see we came in him he didn't come right man would give us eternal life without Calvary right he wasn't Adam come on brother Adam wasn't in e H the bride is in Christ that way we're one that is true Oneness so when he was joking I was joking when he was chosen to be what he was I was chosen to be there too he said then that's another that's God to be a respecter person okay now we can't believe that God's respecter person's right so there must be some conceivable way of understanding that he's not a respecter of person and I hope it's what you just heard me say yes he never chose to be one he was he was just what he was right you didn't choose to be a Christian brother colleague he wasn't sick in God now come on you was Innovation we're human we're on this side okay we covered that this morning you were praying you were doing but what was it God was trying to run you down right right we weren't seeking God it was God seeking us the goodness of God the scripture said lead us to repentance he was trying to chase us down we thought we'd tried to chase him we just got in the way are we done but we thought was right the Holy Ghost never came on the death Pentecost because the 120 was so perfect they were just died they believed God's word and they stood there what a good thing did you do to be saved wouldn't that what was asked of one of the disciples that what good thing a rest of Jesus what good thing Jesus said do this do this today he said I've done every minute and the Bible said he looked at him and he loved him because he knew he was right he says one thing to hit him what saying what you got together before now like I've always said if he just said you have 10 million dollars go give a couple of million and I'll give you eternal life no voters hey give me you need to pull the wheel for that flopped it down well but when he put it on the basis just give it get away from the thoughts of money and come and follow me would not he have made him a fisher of me and just like the rest of them amen he would give him a job but see his riches was too much he couldn't give up his riches so you see it today people can't give up their riches hmm see then when Jesus come in this world he said within him when he walked ashore to Godly well now it was we little bitty people running around in the body to get over because you're in my spot that's what the kid just do we 'd be right you're getting too close to me he looks like he might be thinking about moving over here now I know your kids don't do that what you see he is he alone has eternal life and the only way we can have eternal life is to receive eternal life right so we step across that bar that we draw time when we get over here and we begin to feel a pull in our heart and you know that comes is not right we're sinners we're sorry for about being that away and we begin to say Lord forgive me we start going to church we start trying to be better we start doing this happening and that's all well and good because God is looking at that he loves that he sees that at least you're trying this ain't no haphazard way back Catholic church now remember they said that God struck Paul down to give him eternal life he made him take it so it was better to force people to serve God you know than it was and not serve him at all so they beat him in to do it they killed him and made them confession see that was their college but surely that's not our thoughts so now we come over onto this side and we have a lot of things involved in we don't realize these things before knowledge predestination choosing a name on the book justification plan of God um land and purpose we don't know we don't have none of that involved coverage we're lost and we may have a knowledge of it because we said in church it may still be lost and I've heard those things but get the point one said we begin to feel a little bit and we need we feel like that you know when brother Brown and said every human mortal come on are you going to amen are you gonna sit there ever human moral I had to shine pool amen he said even the Hot and Hot who's never heard of God he knows there is a God Amen come on he has a desire in his heart but he's not part of God's plan and purpose only his family is a part of his plan and purpose the rest is people that will be foolish virgins and Jews and different things and we'll be given eternal life we're not talking about giving eternal life we're talking about receiving eternal life here that's right so then we we've cried praying long and we we choose him we choose to go to church we choose to do better and he looks down and he says good he sure don't want to act like the devil's children and then he'll come down one day you got to be saved whether you want it or not no he didn't do that he put us over here man we've got an opportunity to accept him as our savior if we don't do that then he's not obligated what do you mean he saw me get eternal life I'm going to get it he saw that attitude you just had he saw that statement you just made he saw that thought you injected you knew you wouldn't write that wasn't his child what's God's child to be what's God's child to be father I love you I'm sorry I haven't been your child I haven't acted like I need to die I haven't had the right attitude I was not done right I've been out in the world forgive me forgive me give me an opportunity and I'll serve you huh see God does look at those times because that has to do with your existence upon Earth but if we wasn't backed our chosen you know we you won't be chosen to be bright that's why the Bible said many are called a few are chosen The Chosen is the ones that was in chosen in him so that everybody that confesses and things like that and praise will not get eternal life but now he will not override your free moral agency he gave you that you must start some work must be started here within us crying and praying and sicking after him and then when it does and he can come on the scene and give us eternal life we're not concerned about all these other things seals plagues trumpets vows the end time message or whatever we're just concerned with Father forgive me I love you ever tell him that tell him every day he loves to hear other Prairie green said run around told him said brother Perry said when you feeling close he said you tell anybody around him loves you see when you're feeling close to you you telling brother around lotion he loved God didn't he why because he was a child of God he had a lot of life that he went through because of the choices he made but Danny Henry the tones and interpretation because of this choice of great portion of Heaven's gone away we're going to get rewards for things that we do in this world not to do it not that we want it not that we want it if they come up today and said your dad said when he died he owned this company and he forgot to tell anybody about it so now there's millions of dollars laying there in this company and we're going to give all the children millions of dollars because you're his children would that make me anymore his child oh I'd love him then yeah that's the way we are man I'd really fall in love with love with him being start with I really love him then I like it when he's correcting me but I really love you if he gave me all this money you know yeah how much all this child of Sam Dale regardless of whatever takes place or goes with the name or change that and if they told me right today said well you're wrong you was adopted and we're going to tell you your name is McGillicuddy he was adopted and we'll give you the right to go back to McGillicuddy and you can have all the Miguel McGillicuddy and Heritage I would not change how many of you would change your name to get millions of dollars oh you're dumb and stupid I'll agree with you I am but I have a child of God and I won't turn out my father I know who my father is because this is a kingdom this is not a natural life of what I'll just keep what I am but see then if we go through life we begin to learn about predestination we begin to learn about four knowledge and therefore knowledge is that God for new and he would predestinate because he foreknew I'm beginning to feel pretty good because I did have something to do with it and I was saving myself God save me with the choices I make in life shows whose father that I'm a shut up I thought adoption was to glorify the father I didn't know it was to glorify me and you I tried my best to tell you that everybody thinks adoption is the father going off the scene the son coming home I don't agree with that I never have since I come in the message I've always taught it and you know it adoption to me is the Sun going off the scene and the father being lifted up let me lift up my father amen I don't have to worry about it then he'll Lift Me Up but are you listening we come to glorification we find out hey that was back under justification was back there we're learning the mechanical side over here we're seeing the plan of view of God come into view here because without this there would be no plan this is the plan this is the part that we're to come here and become his children huh we become the word here as we receive the word that's why we want the word we receive it why because it's our father word all right we see the plan and the purpose we're on this side we're beginning to look at things on the side of life because we realized we were chosen than him now you won't have questions today but writing down for Wednesday if you want to and we'll try to cover them because I realized it you know what I'm trying to speak that I leave loopholes and things for people to worry they can can do and and things like that but uh if you need anything about whether you were divided let's see I'm not one specific one forgive me for a second the message call conference in 1963 uh 608 he's talking about how they come down to tongues of fire and not we said we ought to be ashamed to let our organizations divide us when God divided himself Among Us that we might be one you don't have that now so don't look for the quote God divided himself Among Us that we might be one that's something man I thought we believed that we were many members of one body all right this will all men know that you're my disciples do you hear that brother and sister God divided himself we're never divided one another because we're parts of God Amen we're parched off God hmm he divided himself into your you become a part of God and if God divided himself in that great color of fire and those little licks went out over each one of those persons he said what happened on death pinnacle it went out all for the over the persons but with one color of Fire there's just one God we're the last form of God upon the Earth is the Bride of Jesus Christ how many years have I taught you that 30. were the last and morphy of God to the Gentile dispensation which means we are the lives form of God then we are not children of Jesus who was a child of God that makes you a grandchild we are children of the Christ that makes us the children of God that we are a part of that Christ we are the children of God We're The Offspring of God he was the beginning of the creation of God brother and we are the rest of that creation when we're going to believe it you see then Joe where were you when the morning Stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy job may not know that answer but I do I was there is that eternal life no nothing else not persons Souls identities and this that and the other I was there is that part of eternal life that was in him and I saw the Plan of Redemption let me say another word then you can do if Jesus was almighty God to Christ then truly he would look down true and know back before the world man and his submission would be to the cross and the things because he chose to do it he was chosen to be the sacrifice because of his own choosing then we chose not Mormon Doctrine I know the doctrine I know the two Soul doctrines I know what you're talking about I don't believe it but I know it we chose to come into the world we shouted for joy we that have eternal life today shouted for Joy not as people running around Glory Hallelujah shouting in years old in your corner not over my corn weed all over here no it was in Christ bottled up in that one word form but we chose because the Mormon Doctrine is that we were all up in heaven as people and that we wanted to glorify Our Father it's pretty close it's pretty good doing drilling a lot and especially people this message what you believe but we chose now I know this because I spent eight hours with one man that was an authority and let him explain it to me I didn't pick the first ranks I pointed a guy with the and a matter of fact he had that said that some of you if any Mormon would would know he had the sickness he knew because you can't in the Mormons you can't have more than one wife everybody can't have more than one wife and a woman Doctrine never was there it was only the authority people only the Melchizedek preached to them go Ashland find out about the Melchizedek priesthood was allowed more than one life so I asked him to explain it he said we were people up in heaven and we wanted to honor our father and said by doing that said we will decided to come to Earth and be lost so we can glorify Our Father he said Satan had a plan to save everybody now this is their Doctrine but said Jesus had a plan to just say so many and said father accepted Jesus's plan and that's what made the devil mad and caused him to become the devil that's their Doctrine that's all but you see if job is right and if the prophet is right that said that was when we saw the Plan of Redemption come into view then we knew in that form of what we were as eternal we knew we was coming to Earth he said boy you sure don't understand foreign that's why brother Brown said if you have eternal life you was not saved on no certain day you were always saved right you was never lost exactly right glue was never lost the Christ the eternal life right the Christ was never lost that's right man and always Eternal right but you see to how for my father could have it displayed then we come over to this side of the line and we become human Mortals he knew who would be saved and he wouldn't that's right we also knew that there'd be a lot more people in heaven because you and I would come this way right foolish virgins and people like that's going to be in heaven they're going to be given eternal life a lot of people are going to be giving eternal life and being the good to you right right right but you see we are part of the Christ We Are The Offspring of God as Paul said on on Mars Hill he said even as your poets have said We Are The Offspring of God The Offspring of God are not children of God that are children like that it's God in another form called a child see can we go back we're going to see Jesus but we're going to realize he was almighty God God that's what I'm talking about this thing I hope you understand sorry being a little nasty this afternoon got to the basis of come on musician I got to the bases wondered about whether or not to quit preaching a lot of times to you because we go outside last Sunday we went outside and it was five o'clock or 5 30. we got out there at four to five thirty before everybody left I thought my Lord I could preach another home I mean this but we don't want to do that because the mind can only comprehend what the bottom can endure so that's a pretty good statement you know you get tired and wore out then you don't understand but go home listen to the tape you see anything I'm wrong on come to me don't go to everybody else now do me a favor and come to me and talk to me about it and say I don't agree with you if you want you to find out I ain't gonna argue with you or get mad at you and stomp at you and run to the pulpit but brother dick call me out wrong that's the way people do that's the way preachers do trying to scare the congregation into submission I want you to love God Amen with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your being and you know what you can't never hate me like I've always told you if I've got your soul in my possession you may not have to worry about money if your soul is in my hands but she won't mind everybody else want some money and we're about to show they just want the money but that's all right that's their business you know how I live and what I do most of you make more money than I do and it's because of my choice but you know sometimes choices has to do with Wade gave up more money per week than most of you make in a week and that some of you make in a month the girl from plant manager to cut and grass that's because he wanted it in a way a few years ago I cut my salary 200 a week just because I didn't need it you don't need it give it to me well I don't need it what I mean by that I got enough to live on why are you going to pack up all of it in the bank now there's nothing we're not going to go out and empty I hope nobody with all of this problems with the government fixing to go busted it'd be sensible to go buy you a few extra groceries and all I can you always need to have that but don't go grow out all your money and stick it in your pocket because if the government goes busted the money in your it is not worth anything it's toilet paper that's the truth brother right that's right and Mike is all excited maybe this will be what'll put us in a rat no no a reveal word you're going to put us in Rapture when we realize who we are go ahead brother I'm sorry 252 in red book 252 in the red book anybody have a name everybody knows the first words is working me from from God brought that Pride out of his body right my life is powering would be displayed on the death penis when the Holy Ghost would come down the bike thank you and when that Holy Ghost came at the end today we are damn he chose me you've heard me Kevin I told my wife that way would be preaching the gospel can't even Shadow me that forfeit when he was still out in the world I never went told him tell him God called into breach months later he's coming he said Daddy I want to talk to nothing you don't want to talk to me it's not not the daddy you need to talk to he said do you know what I am talking about I said yesterday I should go ask your mother God doesn't show me where you'd be I said but now son We're not gonna have something call the bridge I said run run Charlie runs you down you know the prophet that God gave me a volunteered Ryan you can't run no further months later he comes I can't go away foreign since the beginning not the prodigal son we need to hold me I love to look in the Bible and find myself just because my name is Samuel I don't go by that but you know it is odd that Samuel's mother was named Hannah and Samuel was a child of old age she was real old my mother was 42 or 40 at least somewhere right in there my daddy was 65 when I was conceived Hannah had a son named Samuel but see that don't make me anything it's just good things that I like to see along the way how many of you can relate to what David why don't you put yourself in the Bible sometimes why don't you women men whatever put yourself in there he said to David he said I took you from the Sheep go sheep go oh whatever it was I said a major key thank you I took him for a little longer machine foreign I look at that sometime when I say God what might you know my wife would take two or three dollars that's all we have and buy our food for a week and plan

world to open I got a good home I got a good car I got good things around I got good clothes but what do you think about yourself brought you into the message of that I want you to think about
