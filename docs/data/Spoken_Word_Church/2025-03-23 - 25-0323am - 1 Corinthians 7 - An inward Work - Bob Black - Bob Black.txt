========================================

good to be in the house of the Lord I don't have any slides this morning but we'll just look at 1 Corinthians chapter 7 kind of where we left off last time and just a read through so if you want to turn in your Bible to 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and we'll we'll turn down to about verse 17 and just read through Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together in around your word this morning Lord so thank you Lord for sending us a a messenger in this last day to to patch up all the Loose Ends and and and to give us something to defeat the enemy with Lord I pray God that you'll just help us this morning Lord as we walk through these scriptures Lord that you'll give us strength and encouragement Lord be with us today Lord God that you'll be in the house of God be with us to give us light on on these words that we read we ask now in your precious name [Music] amen now Paul so in in verse 17 he says But as God has hath distributed to every man as the Lord hath called everyone so let him walk and so ordain I in all churches now you think everybody in in the building this morning has come from different backgrounds and has has a different you know different vocations and and you know when you really start to meditate on it it's it's so odd that even sometimes even when you're when you are a sinner that God can begin to frame it up your life so that the the things that you like you know somebody might be in a club playing a piano or something but then when they get saved now God can use that that uh what they've learned to play in the piano now he's moving it into uh using it for the for God's glory so he what what what he's saying is don't abandon your vocation don't uh you know if you're a teacher don't try to change that if you're a a a uh you know what whatever God has called you to be in life then don't because now you're a Christian don't don't change things up just because that now you're uh now you're a Christian to try to be try to be different every person has been given a unique calling and a set of circumstances by God so regardless of your situation your background or the specific abilities you've received just walk in the role that God has specifically assigned to you now I like you know if you go read that the little strange book in the Bible I might not pronounce it right some say fimon and fimon and it's a story about a little slave named onesimus that that uh that he he's he's a slave and he runs away to try to get get away from his slave owner and and while he's away he gets he runs into Paul and Paul uh tells him about the gospel and he gets saved and Paul tells him well go on back home and and just keep get being a witness go back home to your slave master what a strange thing for somebody to do go don't don't try to change things you go back home and and now you'll be a witness and and you can so he wrote that letter uh to to filimon fimon and and uh kind of shaming him and and and he's sending back the one that ran away from him and so Paul's saying what you everybody's got their own little role in in life and things and you don't have to change things up to be a Christian but you can be you can be a Christian at work you you don't have to get another job you don't have to change things like of course now now let's let's be real if your job is something that a Christian would not do then you would you would have to change things up but look in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 if you jump ahead he saying now you are the body of Christ and members in particular and God has set some in the church first apostles second ear prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps and I love how he's framing this up cuz normally we we'll we'll we'll jump to you got a roll in the church and and we we automatically jump to the five-fold ministry and if you're not a minister then well you know you're going to have to you know just but look he's he's saying people in the church have gifts of healings and helps and there's Gifts of government and diversities of tongue tongues and are all Apostles are are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles no he's saying he's saying everybody has their own role to do and and and you God will put you in your role in life to a homemaker or uh or or just somebody that can make bake cakes for somebody and and and give a word of encouragement and everybody's got their role to do and he he's saying have have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but cover earnestly the best gifts and then he's then of course he's framing it up as he goes into 1 Corinthians 13 that we'll get to a little bit later yet I show you unto you a more excellent way so despite all our jobs all our roles all our activities all the things that we can do now let let's look at love in 1 Corinthians 13 you you think you you know you got a good job or whatever but do you do you love do you think you know everything you think if you've got all knowledge all these things but what about love now so back to 1 Corinthians 7 God has distributed to every man so if if we look at that really what he's framing up is is is is be content with what you are don't compare yourself to others don't try to change your situation and then the attempt to be a better Christian like in 2 Corinthians 10:2 he says for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not Wise It's not wise to compare yourself with one another or or to you know that one of the one of the greatest examples in the Bible was is where you've got the 12 Hebrew children Simeon and Judah and so forth and they've all you think about when they were born their mother actually prophesied where they would be placed in the promised land and each of them had their own particular role that they were going to do but then Here Comes Joseph and he got a coat of many colors and they all got jealous and envious because he had a different role that he was going to play even though each of them had their own part to play they got jealous and tossed him in a whale and and so that's why in Galatians chap 6:4 it says but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another in Proverbs 14:30 says a sound heart is the life of the flesh but Envy the rotness of the bones what what's Paul saying God has distributed to every man as the Lord ha called everyone so let him walk and so ordain I in all churches just walk in the way that God has called you and be content in the life story brother Ry said they sent me a milliion 500,000 and a b Bank draft two agents brought it me living in a two room Shanty at the time but it's not money what makes happiness happiness doesn't consist of how much of the world's Goods you own but how contented you are with the portion that has been lotted to you just make your self contented as long as one thing that brings contentment and that alone is Jesus Christ Now isn't that something that if you got Jesus Christ it don't matter if you're a doormat in the church it don't matter if nobody else likes you that if you really lock into that that secret that Jesus Christ is the secret to that secret inward joy that when nobody else likes you when everybody's talking bad about you if you got Jesus that's all that matters really to a Christian and the patmas vision he said have you ever noticed how sweet and relaxing the sound of water can be he said I like to fish and I like to find a spot where the water is whispering in ripples I can just lie back and hear it speaking peace and joy and contentment to my heart now that's what's happening when you when you look at lock into these scriptures or just sit back and listen to like what we're just listening to brother brandom it it speaks joy and contentment just like a Rippling water and that's that's all you need to be Happ happy how glad I am to be anchored in the Haven of Rest where the voice of the Lord speaks peace as the word of the Waters of Separation hath declared just be content in Christ now Verse 18 says is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised now now if we really meditate on this this is this is a little bit strange what Paul is saying here all this time the the the Jews or or you know the people that he's speaking to had framed up their view of of coming to God is based on these Old Testament laws and the outward work and that's the same way that many people come to church with this Viewpoint that I've got to work something up I've got to do something on the outside I've got to please God by the only way I can be justified is by doing something on the outside washing up the outside and they don't worry about the inside so this is what Paul is speaking to is any man called being circumcised let him not become UNC uncircumcised is any called an uncircumcision let him not be circumcised circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of The Commandments of God let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called you know he what he what he's doing is he's framing up that what counts is not your and this is maybe contrary to the way that many even message Believers might look is what counts is not your external appearance or your ritual compliance your keeping of some like a bullet list of rules and things but your obedience to keeping of God's Commandments because of an inward change it's your inner transformation and your continued faithful living your fruits that Define your Christian life now now Paul would Echo that in Romans chapter 2 verse 28 if if you're writing scriptures down Romans 2:28 where he says for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly now this we could say the same thing today about a Christian you're not a Christian that's just outwardly you're not a Christian because you come to church and you wear long hair and and you wear a dress sisters or because a man changes his appearance to fit in that's not what what makes you a Christian where now you got your your check box where you can check off well I've done this I've done that I've done this it's not a Christ you're not a Jew which outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart and the spirit and not in the letter not just learning some rules and some things that you're going to follow it's not it's not in that whose praise is not of men but of God you see you outwardly circumcision of the flesh you you can get a lot of praise and pats on the back from men but what about praise from God God is looking at the heart like when when he selected David and bypassed to all the others because he's looking at the heart the little little scrawny fellow that everybody would bypass where where the men of Israel chose Saul that that was a head and shoulders above everybody else it looks good on the outside but on the inside what is it now now this is the this is the thing that stumbles it stumbled people for for for years that people even today critics of the message think well you're you're just keeping a lot of book rules and you're kind of like a cult or something where you got a lot of Rules and Things and if you don't keep the rules that you're out it's because of fundamental misunderstanding of what the message is the gospel is not to give us a list of rules that we keep outwardly and then in inside we can just act whatever or inside we can hate our brother and inside we we don't forgive but it's an inward transformation when when God gets a hold of your life and the power of the Gospel begins to change you you're changed inwardly and then that begins to manifest outwardly now that's what's caused a lot of stumbling over scriptures like in in in Deuteronomy 225 the scripture that says talk tells women how to how how we're supposed to supposed to dress and and that that scripture says now now let's frame it up what we're talking about are we just keeping rules or or are we talking about an inward transformation in Deuteronomy 22:5 it says the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are Abomination unto the Lord thy God now excuse me what does this have to do with what Paul's talking about circumcision it's the it's exactly the same thing the the Jews thought as long as I can keep this outward demonstration and don't change anything on the inside then I'm I'm all right now so PA Paul's in the Old Testament what we the question comes up sometimes why why why are there some Old Testament scriptures that are still applicable today and others that are not now let's think about that for a second why why do we not still sacrifice bulls and goats and you don't have to why do we not have to sacri sacrifice a bulock it's because those things were fulfilled in Christ right why do we not why do we not have to uh have a high priest and have have have a priest in that role that are doing all the temple things and you have to bring some turtle doves every time you you you you do something wrong that requires the sacrifice of a turtle of is because there are the Old Testament law could be divided into three different areas ceremonial that's fulfilled in Christ the the ritualistic sacrifices and the garments of the high priest and the priest and so forth civil that the laws that kind of govern how the the Jewish Nation the Israelite nation was governed of course the Israelite Nation we're not part of that Nation anymore so those things we can kind of lay over to the side but then the moral law that tells how the inward nature of a person is supposed to act you got the Ten Commandments honor thy father and thy mother and and uh Worship the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and those things are th those you because they illustrate the nature of God and God is unchanging he's the same yesterday today and forever those things are consistent and run all the way through the Bible and so when it says that all that do so all that all that crossdress are an Abomination unto the Lord thy God that illustrates the unchanging nature of God that God always and forever will regard a crossdresser as an Abomination whether it was 6,000 years ago 5,000 4,000 or whether it was 10 minutes ago God will always regard a crossdresser as an Abomination unto the Lord and so to fix that though it's not an outward well I I got to I got to meet this requirement on the outside that's not satisfactory you got to be changed and transformed by the blood of the Lamb applied to you where his life is actually applied to your life and changes your desires because if you're doing it unwillingly or you're just coerced into it well that will never work but if you're doing it because God has changed you to to love him and and to desire to follow him and to to to to line up with his word then that's a totally different matter you know and I'm going to sit on this for a little bit crossdressing is when a person wears clothing and adopts Styles or appearances traditionally associated with the opposite sex for example a man wearing women's dresses and makeup or a woman dressing in traditionally masculine clothing to intentionally present as male you remember the story brother Ram told about how he was on the on the bus and he he was joking around with an old minor or what a construction worker or whatever slapped him on the knee and then realized that it wasn't a man it was a woman and he said I'm so sorry because you look the the frame that God has put together is that you should be able to tell the difference there is a difference and when he was slapping the ma the the knee of that man it's because he thought it was a man he couldn't tell the difference and and and real Holiness the real Godly pattern is to tell a difference and and the reason why we should be able to tell the difference is because there is a difference and the modern world wants us to think that there's no difference between a man and a woman well a woman can be a marine but but fact of the matter is a woman just is not going to be able to do push-ups and pull-ups and run and and so forth like a man and she might be able to do a job but she'll never because there's a difference she will never be able to do in the same capacity as a man she'll never have the strength in her body and and and and and many things that a man cannot do that a woman can because they're just different and so there's that's the pattern that God set up from the beginning is there's a difference and when when the devil wants to lap them things over and and and and cross them over so that you can't tell the difference you know I've been on the subway in Atlanta and I've seen everything thing in the world of say men wearing dresses and and all the other thing and and it it creates a chaos cu the Devils that Au through chaos it creates this this this situation where you're there's just a bunch of confusion so this prohibition against crossdressing isn't just about following a set of arbitrary rules it reflects a divinely inspired principle that the roles the character and the appearance of men and women are meant to be distinct men and women are different boy y'all should be really pulling on this this morning y'all praise God brother Bob this is this is what I believe it is what you believe is it so you know you look at all the different the ways that men men and women are different men men have higher levels of testosterone so they're going to have more muscle mass broader shoulders thicker skin facial and body hair uh who was it preaching recently said if if I look at a woman and she's got an Adam's apple it's it's because it's something's something's something strange something's off a deeper voice cuz you got those larger vocal cords and women have higher levels of estrogen and progesterone so they're going to have they're going to be made for for child rearing and child birth and they're going to be designed so that they can love up on those children and raise them and things and they're going to have it's just different and Men even in their brain we are brains we got more Gra matter and and women and of course I don't really know what that means but all I know is that women women have more white matter and they you know they say that's connect link to connectivity between brain regions and so maybe you could dive into that and and and figure out what that means and everything but but men men are designed biologically for strength and provision and Leadership roles and women are designed for nurturing and childbearing and and relational bonding and and God aren't you glad God made us that way so that we ain't all the same and that's what Paul's speaking to we all have our own roles in life and we're all have our our differences that God made us this way and and there's a difference between men and women and that's why we dress different that's why we look different and that's why our women have got to look modest and so in 1 Timothy chap 2:9 Paul tells us that New Testament scripture he says in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel now let's think about what he say modest apparel with shamefacedness and soety not with broaded hair now he's he's contrasting how women of the world W want to doll themselves up but a real Christian woman all she needs is her character and and and any young man that's looking for a wife or something will realize that's what I'm really looking for I ain't looking for somebody that's all doled up with a bunch of fake makeup on her face or that's that's that's trying to present herself in a way that represents the values of the world but I want somebody like Esther that all she come out to when she come before the king all she have was her character and that was enough to be queen of all Persia that was enough her character in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works that's all a Christian woman wants now what what is Modesty though modesty is the practice of dressing acting and speaking in a way that is humble decent and not intended to draw improper or excessive attention to oneself now now look you you go I I ride the subway in Atlanta and and there there wasn't a modest person on the subway everybody's wanting to draw attention to themselves and in this modern world it's it's like we I was sitting in the car with my wife and my family yesterday as we were just riding around and we were looking at people going in and out of Walmart and we're just like the world has gone insane because the all sense of modesty has totally been just tossed into the bin the the world it's like how you would have to be insane to put on the clothes that people are wearing where you can see well just you can see everything and to go into Walmart like that in your pajamas every just fly on an airplane in your pajamas with everything out so now now that's that's the opposite of modesty modesty is not trying to attract attention to yourself and and and the definition of it especially in terms of sexual attraction or vanity now there's modest when Paul says dress Adorn yourself in modest apparel that is the definition of how a real Christian woman should dress that when a man when a carnal man with that beastly nature that has not been changed by the Holy Ghost when he looks on you he's not he you're covered up and you cover up because out in the world that there's all these carnal beastly men that are going to look look at you that way if you don't cover up and so the point of all these things is that the gospel the gospel is not just a book of rules that we're following it's not just a list a bullet list you know when I'm at work I'm in a meeting we make a list of stuff I got to do action items and it ain't it ain't action items that we're trying to check off but it's God coming and transforming our heart to changes now in Matthew chap 23: 25-28 Jesus said woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess now blind Pharisee it you're you're blind if you're just doing it by a book of rules and you're blind if you think that's what other people are doing you ever you ever see the critic they'll come in come in church and they think because the that's the way they're doing it that's the way everybody else is doing it too this was this is M must be the way that everybody else thinks about things no Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are like unto whed supplers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto me men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity it's the holy spirit that changes us brother Rand would tell the story and and I'm going to close here in just a moment of of of uh he he he talked about how when he was preaching over in Africa he'd said young ladies standing there just in the bloom of life and and they'd be naked imagine a prophet preaching in Africa to people sitting there that were like legit naked but what what reaction would happen when the Holy Ghost get a hold of them he said they didn't know it that was more no more shame to them than looking at your hand now what he's framing up is they didn't know they were naked and if you told them they were naked they would not believe you but when the Holy Ghost got a hold of them it changed everything you could even tell them they were naked and they were no but the Holy Ghost changes everything that was no more shame to them than looking at your hand young 16 18 20 year old girls mothers with their babies nursing and not 20 ft from where I was sitting a mother give birth to a baby while I was talking another lady just helped it she just picked the baby up and started nursing the baby another lady next to him started this lady's given birth this lady jumps in to help picks up the baby start started nursing it right there in the meeting went on listening to me preach and those young ladies standing there fully formed and developed women and when the Holy Spirit came no sooner than he struck them they cover themselves with their arms the Holy Spirit brings a realization of nakedness and I'll read this other quote and then we'll uh the musicians go ahead and come forward he said now how can we sisters how can we in this nation where we claim to believe and be Christians and every year they take more off when that person never even heard the name of Christ but just accepted him in their heart no you couldn't tell them they were naked they didn't know it but they covered themselves up like this to walk away the next day or two you would find them with clothes on of some kind now that's Africa and then he brings it home to America there is something wrong somewhere it's a twisting up of theology the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ like he did to the man who called Legion we found him clothed and in his right mind and I begin to believe that it's a spirit upon the people that drives them into that americanism and frenchis and all kinds of worldism and churchism but let them once come to the master and they feel that knock at the door they'll put clothes on and act like like women and men and they'll be born again Christians let me ask you this question why is a Christian modest well we're checking things off our list and we got to do it or else we'll get scolded at church like like a good pH the Pharisees would go around coning people upside the head in the day that they lived and if you didn't match up to their uh the the way that they thought that you should be living but that's not why a Christian modest is modest a Christian is modest because the Holy Ghost has a nature and when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive that nature and the nature now is living in you and your desires and your wants and the way that you are changes because the Holy Ghost is in the business of changing things God bless you Saints [Applause]
