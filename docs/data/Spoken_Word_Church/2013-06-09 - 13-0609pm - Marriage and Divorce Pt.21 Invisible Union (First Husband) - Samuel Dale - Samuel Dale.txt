holy I want to see you amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you good to be in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn back to Romans seven let's see am I on yeah okay all right thought it was Romans 7 now remember the men are supposed to meet after the service this afternoon to talk about the um Father's Day time next weekend and also just make sure you you know you understand what you got to bring if you don't get to come or be there to understand just make sure you bring enough you know fix it to where you can take care of it we generally try to take care of of the food and the stuff like that you know but you have to bring your drinks and your clothes and your sleeping bags and things and it may be a little cool so if I you I'd put a little extra in to do CU been getting an extremely large amount of rain so it may be a different thing if you can't do that come up and be with us and sit around the campfire and eat some catfish and I mean some trout and just have a good time you can bring your catfish we'll cook it too but we'll have a good time doing it and all fellowshipping together I think that's about all the announcements that is to be made so just remember these things Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day in your grace and your kindness unto us and thank you for you Lord because without you where would we be Lord our whole dependance is upon one thing that you are God and you change not that you're Lord revealing yourself unto us by way of the opening of the word it may sound like to a lot of people that this is just old stories but remember In Those Old stories there is redemption we love you and we thank you Father and we pray that you would just bless each one remember the ones that are here remember the sick ones and just have your way with each and every one of us we love you and we thank you we commit it all to you now in Jesus name amen Romans 7 know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over man as long as he liveth now remember now he's going to illustrate it he's using an illustration to explain what he's talking about for the woman which hath an husb husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren when ye also are become dead to the my brethren ye also are become dead to the law how by the body of Christ that we should be married to another even to him that who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death see the law couldn't deliver nobody I don't know why everybody wants rules and regulations and something to do when the law could never deliver it's a policeman to put you in jail it's not a deliverer but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were h H that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now to try to get on with it we won't back up we'll try to press on with the thought we were bringing this morning to get a point to us to where we can understand now what I'm saying to you and I tell you where that you can study it that way the same quotes that we going to be using this afternoon all right are you listening everybody ain't listening all right the same quotes that we use this afternoon about the New Birth will be used on the marriage and divorce situation and then it will be used onto law and Grace all right we're not having to go to another book I'm not asking you to read 49 different books I'm asking you to read the invisible Union amen but then just read it with an understanding that you know you're listening to what the prophet is saying and then we don't have to worry about it we can and go through the message from there now all right we talking about this morning that we must be separated by spiritual death which means a death to ourselves all right we must die to ourselves as I said this morning don't worry too much about it we're born Dead all right it it shouldn't be a hard thing to die when you realize you're dead that's you maybe a funny way of saying it but it shouldn't be we should realize realization that you and I the best could be is not capable of going before a living God that's right no matter how holy we think we are I tried to explain even people worshiping a totem pole why would somebody Worship in a totem Pole now you know why would they bring some form of offering right right right I mean people who worship totem po bring an offering it may be their own children they offer to to you know whatever or some form why did Cain offer an offering he wanted able to offer an offering see why would we even consider it that we need to offer an offering that point itself shows that we're dead that we're lost right that we're not worthy or why would you come bringing something uh Brother Anderson and them uh they still holding some of their tradition if they come to your house they'll bring you a pineapple well that's just a tradition that's hold over from their customs and ways you know to bring you something why do we have a housewarming for people you know you want to give them something all right see because that's that's all tied together in the worship part of it so then we realize that we're lost and we need a savior am all right and doing that then we must realize that there's something wrong as I was trying to express this morning why is it that everybody that says they believe is not born again don't you ever think like that of why why is it right when you've been through life yourself and seen it or maybe experienced a lot of of going to the altar crying and praying and and fasting and doing all kind of things and come out of it kind of feeling pretty good but then less than a week later you're down at the mouth again you know as we got the old saying you know you're down you're you're you're feel like there's something wrong do we get saved and lost well see then that we should realize that there's something wrong when the prophet would say you accepting Jesus Christ as your savior is wonderful you got to do that but he said has he accepted you that's right that's right see if he don't accept us right we don't get saved right well now why does not he accept us you know what I'm saying why is is it that not every person gets up yes I believe Jesus to be the Christ why is every person not saved it must be something wrong with our approach right amen right something's wrong with those inner beinging parts of us that I tried to bring out the other night about the soul of the individual that even though we're lost we still have a longing for God amen a desire that's right well why doesn't God just run right to our desires and save us it's because we have been blinded to the ways of coming to God now listen by the people that were supposed to known the way to come to God right right now doesn't that exactly fit back there where Jesus was at right when the people that should have known who he was was the people that turned around and killed him that's right amen and they'd have to admit we know you're a teacher come from God and we know yes that God's got to be with you cuz look what you can do that's right but they still wouldn't have it that's right you see church we can Glory all we want to in believing the message and signs and wonders and and everything and still be totally lost you know that's that's on my mind I'm sorry because that's just part of me is to be I I want you to have an experience with God I want you to have something that'll hold on to you not that you hold on to it I ain't never held on to my religion right cuz I always figured I didn't have any right right right it's whether or not he holds on to me all we see in doing that then we must die to ourselves our thinking our ways our actions that's right and become born again right and that old nature that we read this morning that old adamic nature that we had that was born with was our first husband that's right amen right yeah but I've never been married I'm tell you people don't like that see but you see you and I were married to the devil right amen that's right he was our husband that's right right because we're born in his domain right being born in his domain put us in a position to where that he was closer to akin to us than God right yeah but we don't like that you can say well well that's all right I agree with it but then I can see that old SED up part goes back under see you know you don't like that statements like that why not when are we going to just be honest with ourselves and admit where we're at where God can do something for us amen as I saying this morning why was it with John orever who it was he couldn't get the Holy Ghost some of those people couldn't which were born again Christians praying for the people in the book of Acts couldn't get the Holy Ghost come on them they sent for these other brothers they come down simply said a few words laid their hand on the Holy Ghost fell right what was the problem somebody's approach wasn't correct well see then you come up and somebody like me that's dry hide and cut and everything else but you think I'm against emotions and feelings and all it's wonderful but that's the after effect right that's after the baby is born it cries right see we put it ahead we swap it over but what we need see is salvation and to do that then we re really need to realize what did take place see we could spend weeks and months preaching on justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to see what happens but when are we going to start believing what happen that's it amen and realizing what God has done is was ending up this morning talking about then see God himself had to come down and die that you and I could have salvation this is not to come down and pass out books and you know went on off the Earth and things he had to die right he died for them that was dead cuz we're all dead in sin trespasses right and he had to die and then we lightly think about it and well all we got to do is just believe well the devil's done got ahead of you amen cuz he certainly believed and trembled about it that's right amen that's what I've tried my best to get you to see down through time the ages G by the Bible said God wink to their ignorance right right I said then he commands all men to repent now what does that mean to you that God winked at your ignorance that means we ignorant right and God overlooked it right right is that the best way to say winked that you're ignorant you we were just PL ignorant and he overlooked that all right and saved us anyway amen amen you explain to me how that God can get into the soul of an individual with all the junk that we've got I don't understand that even experience it and everything else but don't understand it how that he can save you and me but it meant he had to die well all he wants us to do is die to ourselves that's right amen accept him as our savior yes right and be born again amen amen that's right that means then our old husband is dead you don't have to worry about that husband no more totally dead gone out of the way annihilated we'll read in a minute where the Prophet said not even one Speck can be left that's why if you read the future home you'll see the most beautiful story of redemption especially about the first 15 18 pages and see justification chops off you sin does nothing to your nature that's right sanctification starts to work upon that nature as to bring in the nature of the individual in the line are cleansing us or setting us aside but then you got the Bible says the Holy Ghost and Fire that's right now that's not two works right that's not the Holy Ghost doing one thing the fire doing something else it's the holy ghost coming in to live and his presence burns out all that's left that's right amen you see well if I'm Sanctified what was left the vessel that's right amen that we still lost right just because the devil went out don't make you saved that's right right see then it will come to that basis that that old husband his little telltale signs is still there even though the unclean Spirit has gone out if the unclean Spirit goes out of a man why does it leave him same thing he was when the unclean Spirit came in right what was we when the were when the unclean Spirit come in we was a pure vessel right right because we were a baby right God can't create anything impure so he created US Body Spirit and soul the spirit and soul of that baby come from God the body comes from mama and daddy that's right but it's as perfect as can be I didn't say Eternal I said perfect cuz God can't create something imperfect then we became imperfect right right we became dead cuz even babies until the age of accountability go to heaven right if they die before the age of accountability they go to heaven it goes to prove the devil hadn't taken over that much yet all right see then looking at Salvation we see ourselves and if we can reckon ourselves dead reckon ourselves lost no good and then say Lord come in and save me that's right am and just clean out everything that's left that's why I said it over and over and people don't like it they don't like my ways I'm sorry but I just tell you what happened when I left the Baptist Church I told him at the church we went to I said God got me out of the denomination now I want the denomination out of me what you mean got you left didn't you yep I went out the door looking like this I walked in the other door looking like this I still looked alike and I still acted alike and you know would you see one of these days you'll realize what I'm driving at the new birth finishes when we change the body and walk off this Earth in a Rapture that's the finish of the new birth until that time you know what we're doing we're being being born again so why would we worry about thinking that we could be lost okay that's the devil talking to me see you're sitting there saying I'm the devil talking to you no you didn't notice that who you talking about well he's telling me I'm lost and I know I ain't well you talking about me so go ahead and call me the devil do what you want to but just listen to what I'm saying that's right because your actions and reactions will prove it you get upset for me telling you you're lost if I walk down there to brother dick and I said brother dick I want to tell you up front you're lost as a blind dog in The Meat House thank well he raised his hand and said thank you but what would most of you do I tell you I've been saved I prove that you I've been saved I'm in the message yeah but's see can we take the truth right all right but see dead to ourselves that means that that everything that I was from that Old husband now you see what I'm talking about if you listen You'll see we're talking about the old husband your first husband yes now when we get into invisible and get into the marriage and divorce we're going to talk about having a first husband and then we're going to talk about running around with other husbands right and getting all messed up then when we get to the law and Grace we're going to talk about the old husband see what's going to be hard to realize is is to find out that new birth if you just realize what it is am it makes that Soul so perfect until there's not one mark of sin against it if it is you're not born again right but if we can see that old husband die amen you see what I'm talking about how you going to understand marriage and divorce of a Grace see when you come and brother Dale I've never been married two a three times I got one husband yeah well why so many boyfriends hanging around you know cuz that's why the prophet said it but understand me under that old nature that old husband we're going to read right here and start in on it that put us in this Bible cuz his Bible is a book of records right right Paul don't mind saying I was lost and I was saved right he didn't have no problems about the Bible telling me is lost the word tell him is lost but you know the letter of the word never could tell him he lost you remember the end of the message this morning I said you'd have to realize that God is real is the Holy Ghost is a person it's not a thought or a good idea or a good feeling or he's a person he's the person of the Holy Ghost he's God that's right to come and live in you Paul said the life that I now live In the Flesh I live by what now what was Paul saying the life that I now live in the flesh he didn't claim to be alive in his soul he claimed to be still alive in his flesh right right cuz in his soul Paul wasn't alive amen Paul buried that old man but look at Paul's experience see brother R said God put some people in a place where that that they can tell us these things look at the Apostle Paul the greatest of all the religious side you could think of but yet found out he's lost right see then he realized that there's something wrong so he died he died spiritually to himself and accepted the new birth and to do that meant the only way that could happen was for almighty God to come down no doubt Paul had heard of the and even witnessed the stoning of Steven right right even witnessed him looking up brother around said later then on in life that Paul realized those things and said you know he wasn't even worthy to live he didn't count himself to be he wanted to die for the gospel he had heard about Jesus in his teaching even though he was done p on before he come into existence as we know as writing but you know he probably heard of him I mean how could Jesus been up there with all the Pharisees and the things and all the time that he was for three and A2 years for not basics of people at least around th heard about him but all of that didn't convert him but a personal experience why would brother randam emphasize so much when he would say Paul said once he was struck down that by that blinding blinding light said Paul would have never called that like God if he hadn't know right he said Lord who art thou he knew the evidence the signs the pillar of fire the things he knew that from the study of the word he knew the logos the theophany the things and all of the creation of the world and who done what but yet one day he met that God that's all I'm want me and you to do and just meet that God right and then we'll find out but now getting down to the point the prophet said in our old book we're going to have to recognize it to be gone this is the book he's talking about the record of Our Lives is right here before us that we call the Bible right all right so in that Bible we're going to have to find what happened to us what took place in our lives we can go back and read about these others and their experiences that's wonderful but then we must have an experience of our own not because somebody else had an experience that's why I've always said it and I believe it that there's no way to be born again unless you hear the word amen how could you ever be saved if you didn't hear the word it may be that Jesus Christ died for you right that's the word right but if we can't see the old book Gone and our name actually transferred then we can't see that we're born again all right so the basis we start up on is what that almighty God himself had to come down and give his own life because no other man's life could come back on you and I brother R said it like this he said no man died like that man yet they got the doctrines in the message see that what he was just a man brother R said he was more than a man he said he was almighty God but my God can't die see that's argumentive philosophy organized religion is talking all right but see the new birth I keep making these statements now and I got it written here got it before or later the new birth only deals with the soul of the individual it does not deal with your body and your spirit the new birth Chang changes the nature of that soul to God all right then that Soul motivates are controlled or or you know does the spirit and the spirit the body but you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your spirit right you're only Born Again In Your Soul the only part of us right now that can even possibility be thinking of is of being eternal is the soul then in doing that then God had to come down and he was the only one that can do the things that had to be done all right we talk about him a lot about that he could die for you and I that he could go to hell for you and I right that he could heal us he could deliver us but seemingly now in the latter days of past 30 years very little is talked about salvation of the Soul cuz all the doctrines are struck of how Eternal you are and what you don't need this and you don't need that and there no need talking about the new birth that's old stuff they say well it happens to be the only way into the body of Christ I don't know how old it is matter of fact we we serve the it's the oldest religion there is because it was before the foundation of the world that's what the prophet said about it right so why worry about it being old or are you just old head brother Dale well let me just say that away I'm happy all cuz I love to talk about salvation but now remember this point we'll get back to it later on that the little Eagle even though it was born in the barnyard it ate the things the chicken ate and tried to cluck like the chicken right right we used to have old rabbit and that sucker run around through the yard with the dogs I'm talking about rabbit dogs that was born and raised to kill rabbits and that old rabbit would running around through there he thought he was a dog he he probably wound up tackling the next door neighbor his dog one day and found out he wouldn't know but cuz I don't remember what happened to him but think about it the only voice the little Eagle could hear was his mama right see we talk about having too many husbands when we get down to the law and Grace part of this situation we're going to talk about too many mamas right there is an old mother in the Book of Revelations remember and having Harlot daughters you know and all so we got to get into that eventually but now think about it what did God do he gave his life he paid the price he went to hell and cleansed everything but that wasn't all of it and that have been all he done and went on back to Heaven we'd still been in the same shape MH he could have even driven the unclean Spirit out of the Apostles but that wasn't what it was all of those things that he done the climax of it all was to come and live in the soul of those disciples being healed that's good wonderful being delivered that's wonderful somebody pay my price I don't have to go to hell that's fine but you know Peter then were just as dead they had to go to the upper room and wait then when the Holy Ghost came it gave him a new birth now the dealings this afternoon is going to be thinking about what happened to you and I because there's no way that any of us could think about being perfect we need to realize that perfect is a wonderful condition now listen to my wording which one you want to be perfect or you want to be justified so you don't pay attention to the words I use a lot of times or illustrations a little baby at Spirit and soul is just as perfect as can be right you can be forgiven right but what about being justified oh forgiven Justified that's just a play of words I don't understand you CU I'm just forgiven I'm not perfect but I'm forgiven you see that on tags on if you're perfect then you got to be forgiven but that don't mean you're Justified How could a human being ever come to the thought of thinking about that could be justified cuz you'll find these three things in the invisible Union you'll find brother random explaining Justified he said chops off your sins death of the old husband then he'll say Justified it's as though you never done it right have you noticed that in the message I've asked you to read over and over or listen to the tpe then after a while he says you never done it and that's all under the word Justified that's why when we get into the marriage and divorce you'll see us still using those same quotes you know you'll never be justified in the eyes of man right that's right we're just too carnal or whatever the word would be for we're just too human see you see me and I say that wasn't right brother Dale's mad talking the other day with Brother Martin and him dny believe is who it was do you know Jesus got angry the Bible says it Prophet said it but he didn't get mad a difference in the word he got angry because that they done contrary to his word he planted the ropes and he run him out of the temple I don't like him he's mad see we dechristianize him in a hurry wouldn't we the only thing that I've ever said to prove the difference that he was mad or he was angry he wasn't died for those people proved he wasn't mad that's right the Bible says be angry and sin not right don't let the sun go down on your wrath that's you mean anger is okay I didn't say that right I said Jesus got angry that don't put him in a sinful condition like mankind his anger was over the fact of what they was doing with his word and remember the same God that joyously went to Calvary to die for you and I that if we do not accept him as our savior will'll burn us up in the Lake of Fire am is that anger does he get angry no just because we won't do it but now listen what happened at Calvary that must be applied to you and I today see that's we want to preach about somebody else back there right it done this that done that we got great stories and wait said one day all this is about Abraham and and everything but forget talking about Abraham let's talk about you and me but remember the prophet said that whatever condition was met for the P first person that God healed or saved or Etc said if we meet that condition he's honor bound to save us that's right right that's right well now we know it did happen because we got a book full yes of people you know that done those things what is it the church a book said many of the flaws are the people of the Bible but said God got through and made them perfect but actually what happened I said we we can say he went to hell and paid the price we can say he done all these things but actually what happened well his life came back to live in us that's it right there now then that means that in my soul if I'm born again this afternoon is God has imparted his nature in with my nature because if he took me out put him in I wouldn't be me right I'd be him all right see we look at it some go that way I'm him I'm him oh ain't something being him the other one says I don't believe I'm him yet I don't I just I have problems I I think there ought to be a middle of the road brother R said God partnershi you yep amen if the nature of our soul was the devil and that nature went out did our soul die no just the nature part the motivator then he come in to live so it's he and I together as persons that's why I'm Eternal right because he gave me his life amen all right now then Paul could say if not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me that's right and the life that I now live by the faith inside soul of God yes he said I'm wonderful so he said I serve God from the heart but said I see other things happening in my members that I'm having trouble bringing under subjection so he was saying the rest of me is not complete yet right now if I don't get down to the finish up of these notes I got it here on it just remember that when you receive the new birth that is still it's just the earnest of your inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession the product done purchased everything's done but it's not made manifest yet is that what that means so we only have the earnest that's right probably said that mean it's not means it's not the fullness you know it's only the earnest waiting for that rest of us to be done I try to illustrate it we know it Calvary that Israel was saved at Calvary right everybody that ever be saved was saved at Calvary right Christ was paid finished all but it hadn't been applied yet now but if he come in something had to go out amen and that has to be that old husband amen that a damic nature that we were born with yes now what happened now I'm going to say something I don't even know the words to say it but I hope it'll come out right is this just a thing of receiving eternal life is that all your goal is that the fulfilling of God's plan is for somebody to just receive his life remember foolish virgins will be given eternal life is this just a receiving of eternal life what happened when you was born again my brother he said it one time he said what I care how I get to heaven as long as I get there well that sounds good but you know the whole story is not to just him to die to pay the price of our sins and even come and live in us that's not the whole story right right I thought the story of the Bible was for him to die come live in you and I and then you and I live before others and display and preach the gospel and talk to them about the Lord and you know share our our experiences with God and is it just getting eternal life or is it dealing with something that's very very vital to each and every one of us because to look at the old book being gone is one thing but what happened to that book what happened to that old book of our records let's start right there so go ahead brother and pull up number four and we'll start I've got also this afternoon's quote so if y'all want to stay around on supper time we all right which is the earnest until our Redemption okay and we we're number-wise off but go ahead with with uh let's see wait a minute I think I know what would just happened yep you're going to have to every who's on the board going to have to get on the morning's message and brother Anderson I gave him both of them you're on the evening message come back to the morning message all right I I was doing that to try to help Brother Anderson this morning I gave him copies of the morning in the evening and I'd already changed some of the morning so what we're going to is invisible Union paragraph 223 and you'll find it real quick brother Joe by running it up now your old book is gone with your old your old Union so that'll run it fast for you but now while he's getting there we'll stop on well go ahead he's got it now that's what I said they can find me in a hurry most of the time y'all life at my cutting and pasting but I'm in number wise instead of trying to find and go through now your old book is gone with your old union now your name and your old in your has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it where would somebody tell me where that scripture is at I'm not I'm just making a point somebody find that scripture where it's put in the sea of forgetfulness not there right brother dick not in that wording the correct way is that our sins is as far as the east is from the West see we can pick up scriptures and that just that's what it's talking about but I'm just want you to think see a lot of people would SAR and ARG and tell me that's in the Bible it doesn't say see a forgetfulness there only time the words forgot forgetfulness is one time in the Old Testament H just shock you make you wake up one thing get you to thinking cuz when you're thinking it's hard to go to sleep amen God put it now I believe that scripture right there as much as I believe John 3:16 right I believe that scripture as much as John 3:16 is scripture CU he had to do something with my sins that's right now think about what I'm saying is this just to receive eternal life is it just to be or to get to heaven or something or is it to serve a God that can do something that you and I cannot do we can forgive we can do the best we can to forget but we can't do it devil won't let us for one thing what about a God that can't remember right so when he paid the price he done something right more than just coming and living in mankind you done something he put our sins as far as the East is from the West now you know the reason for that don't you North is so far there's a North Pole and there's a South Pole but there ain't no East pole and ain't no West Pole right right so that means if it was North and South you'd have a stopping point but brother Eddie if my sins is as far as the East to the West that means as far as it goes east it just keeps coming back and as far as it goes that's still East it may change the West talking but there was just no place to put them that's right there's nowhere to put them so what are you going to say about them what are you going to say about the sins of a born again believer I'm going to say the best way that I can putting that together with all the scripture you know we serve a God that can forget and nobody can make him remember it that's right that's right and you think God don't have power amen you got that ability nope don't either I don't have it either too much memory right but when he says I forgive you it's gone oh God you remember I said years ago I going to preach one of these days on God with amnesia well that that's hard to do because he doesn't have amnesia the Amnesia is is a fact that it's gone from you and there's no way you can do it God when he put it away may I use my human terminology to in Georgia he annihilated it now you'll see why that R random kept saying it you can be forgiven but not justified cuz see nobody's going to ever I mean everybody's going to remember what you done never forget What's Done Right God annihilated it he didn't just forget it that's what I want you to get this afternoon I know we won't get much time okay okay look what he says God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness now as I said I believe that scripture just like John 3:16 cuz that's exactly what he done he put it not in the sea that's an illustration brother brandom used the illustration of the old man in the geography book or what it was you know and he was reading it and he saw that in places in the ocean that they didn't have no bottom you know well you know that's a story because there is a bottom if it went all the way through come out the other side you know it's an illustration an illustration to the fact that it can't be remembered no more so the prophet when he called it the Sea of his forgetfulness that's better than east to west that's a human terminology that upgrades from east to west to where that it can never be found right it's in a sea of forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God it didn't say you stood perfectly before man the new bir didn't make us no different except it changed that inward part of us it didn't wipe no slate clean that I done that's right now come on I'm talking about to the world right the world still knows all I do yes but God can't remember it that's hard to comprehend now your name is now in the new book not the old Book of Life okay Bible Bible the Old Book of Life told Paul's records and what he done showed how he Stone Steven you know hell the coat told but yet a new book was written when he was born again not written it's just words but the Lamb's Book of Life see now your name is not in just the regular book of life it's in the book of life Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union but your new bride Hallelujah your new life is in the L's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah all right we'll get back on that and on the grace of marriage and divorce your marriage certificate amen okay me and my wife got married 55 years ago in August coming up and uh you know we had to get a marriage certificate you know a piece of paper telling who married who on what date and then the guy was a justice of the peace I'm sorry cuz we back there with neither one of us she went to a Baptist Church I didn't go to nothing but he put his stamp on there you know showing it was done in his home had him and his wife and a cat and my daddy-in-law but he took it overse to the courthouse right and he had it officially recorded it was then known as a m certificant showing that two people had been joined legally because he was a legal representative to be able to seal it and he put it to the court so now your new life is in the lounge Book of Life your marriage certificate now if that old husband is still alive you don't have a marriage certificate CU it's not something pay for work if you're still alive then you're still married to the old husband read but if you got a marriage certificate from God that means you're married to God go that marriage certificate is not of an old nature tied up and it's not saying on that marriage certificate Samuel Dale that was once married to his old adamic nature we know he's tried to divorce it but it doesn't work but I'm going to sign him down here and say that he's I'm married him now God won't do that there's no record of the old man you don't see it on your marriage certificates you go home and look at it so and so and so and so and so and so and so so and so and so and so it's not on there like that it just tells you got married but look Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you're Justified you're not only forgiven but you're Justified according to Romans 5:1 you're Justified now we've heard this probably 5,000 times at it what does Justified mean we've read that over and over go ahead and run it on up onto the next through 25 because this will be continuous reading for a little bit he said' look up the word Look up the word Justified it does not mean forgiven the word means Justified it don't mean you're forgiven you say well I was forgiven of my sins all right the Lord forgave me one wonderful but what did he do with them now I've always made myself plain even on one thing if you just a person coming to Salvation at justification and you ask God to forgive you he can never bring that up again that's how much I believe it amen amen I've always tried to tell you the husband and wife situation marital problems you know that you've got had you're a poor discrepant human being on my terminologies if you bring up the past and try to you know well you're not the husband like my first husband was he was good to me our wife vice versa when you start comparing things you're worse than a hypocrite that's right now brother Dell is angry cuz I don't like stuff like that if you ask me to forgive you it'll never be mentioned again amen well I just can't do it that way Brother D well what you need is a new birth plain but you know what I'm talking about that's what's wrong with families right people marry and remarry and everything then she's got her kids he's got his kids then they got their kids and you got a kid problem cuz he don't want her correcting his and she don't want him correcting hers and then he don't know how to correct or wrong cu the one standing in the middle says you didn't treat them that way you didn't treat that way you got hell on Earth the best way to say it that's but see even to say forgiven do you understand what I'm saying that if you ask me to forgive you and I say yes I accept it that'll never be mentioned again why because that's just human that's me just plain old human nature cuz you see that's where people do it oh yeah oh yeah I forgive you now I'm not dumb I've always told you that I'd forgive my wife if she come and told me something but I I don't want her telling me the next week the same story again with somebody else now that's gets where I don't forgive a lot all right and I'd expect her to be that way when I said I'm not done but even forgiven did God say okay I forgive you but I'm going to put them under a hole little place over here and I'm going to remember them and when you go to the white Throne I'm going to bring them up I don't believe in that kind of a God maybe you do it's what I said even if you just repented of your sins and if you truly repented now really meant it and said God forgive me it's white slate clean sir it's not put in a cubicle to be brought up later or run up on a computer somewhere to be push a button and get back later with you that's right it's gone amen that's the kind of God I serve am look what he says explaining or illustrating what the word Justified means it it don't mean you're forgiven watch it for instance you heard I got drunk and done some evil things and everything and then you come around and say to me now watch it you found out I didn't do them now that's out on most people quot it see other words you said you go out and tell that I was dranking I've done this then you find out I didn't do it you found it out then you come around and say brother random I forgive you you know I didn't do it and you're going to forgive me what a flimsy excuse of forgiveness is it you know I didn't do it sister Gail and then you turn around later and forgive me for doing it that ain't even common sense then you come around and say brother ROM I forgive forgive me didn't do it first place and you know I didn't do it the biggest problem is we did do all of it the devil knows we did and he keeps accusing us and we know we done it the neighbor knows we done it used to be a little old paper done at home called Anderson Independent if you wanted Georgia news all you had to do is get the Anderson Independent they had more Georgia news in it it did anything in South Carolina I always said if you want some gossip just go read to Anderson Independent cuz they're going to be telling about everybody but listen now if I did do it I'm guilty if I did do it but you could forgive me I wouldn't be guilty to you right I wouldn't be guilty that's only to you because I did it but yet I'm not justified because I actually done it but the word Justified is as though you never done it now who can do that except God amen amen is not even regarded at all how is it done how is it that is not regarded there's your key to what he's saying it's not even regarded at all how's it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of God I wish I could do that amen you are Justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you never done it in the first place now that's stronger than doing it and wiping a slate clean right remember what I told you to look up told you to read Justified you done it chopped it off second stage you done it you was justified as though you never done it right third stage you never done it why because you're dealing with the memories of God all right he wasn't married to it to begin with with that's pretty good doing getting rid of the old husband the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated to him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are the predestinated seed well how did you come to do this in other words you've done it we're guilty right how did we come to do it you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parent Eve it's no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after Eve who committed adultery that's a reason you were born in adulteries born in sin s right you're a sinner to begin with that's right you was deceived into it you had no you it ain't your fault you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the lounge book of life now if Justified means what it says it means then God through some way of his only SEC of his own secret Mysteries I'd call it has the ability do not remember amen what we do and if you never done it to start with he's got to have a memory that can remember that you never done it you said what are you talking about I thought the Bible said that he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world sin in the presence of God is automatic Annihilation right that's why he had to come down and pay the price before he could stand with Adam and Eve in his presence are you following me yes see then he never did see what Adam and Eve done come on I want you to approach it some other way and show me how he can do this or that or the other I thought we believe that the blood is what covers Us I thought we believe that the blood that we're not saved by the blood but we're kept saved by the blood because it's an offering of Pardon of you see the part of you that never done it is in that Soul right amen but yet that Soul did do it yet it was lost but God made it to the point that he never remembered you mean brother Dale he can remember some things but he can't remember others you have to talk to him about it I'm just trying to quote scripture to you and talk to you about what the prophet would say that the word Justified means you done it it's gone second time you done it it says though you never done it then you come up to the point of three things that a real you I like to title it that way cuz I tried to do that probably 40 years years ago I've tried to talk about the real you the real you is not the person I'm looking at brother around and said you've never seen me he said you see the body that I inhabit righten he said that real me is that man that's inside that you can't see right but yet we come into the world lost and sinners see God can't accuse you of something you didn't do we know we done it but he just takes it just takes it cowly out of existence am you know the story that the illustration the prophet uses of the man that killed the King's son and they were going to kill him mhm he goes down and talks to him you know and the man said I'm sorry fit of rage I killed him he goes back and he sends a chariot down rolls out a carpet walks up and has them to clean him up and bring him out said put this robe on but do we really listen to the rest of that story he said go down there and destroy all the records said you're my son do we really listen to that don't you realize the whole story would be then my son never existed you are my son God knew before the foundation of world who wouldd be saved and who wouldn't that's right he knew who' accept him as Savior and he knew who he'd give the baptism of the Holy Ghost to how did we come to do it we're deceived into it we come to this earth our adulterous parents brought us into the world but yet God don't never see it a man that's born of God a Son of God has to have the nature of God he has to be like God he honors God he is a part of the word of God and in this last days of this bride taken form exactly the same power that he was at the beginning has come up through these organizations and so forth come out for the bride he can't be nothing else but that go to 262 going to number seven the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by what by the washing of the water of the word now what does that mean now that means that I did have a book I did have a book and all of my things was written in it but some way he took as we used to do old fireplaces and things in the houses he took a little white wash and totally annihilated all of it but you see we couldn't come up with enough to cover all that because it' bleed back through but he just annihilated our sins songs are songs but there's a good one that says what sins are you talking about that's a good song If God has forgiven what sins how did he do it well we're just so good till he just come down and he that's what I say a moment ago is it just to have eternal life or is it just to go to heaven or to realize here what he's done he's washed us with the water of the word that's why Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word that's why the preachers are here to preach it the preacher is supposed to be washing you with the word but what I hear most of them doing is condemning you for what you do or the other side is praising you for how much Glory you are and they're leaving out to washing how would you have liked to B uh Aaron and they finished the temple they got ready and they got all of the things ready to make the sacrifice Moses said Aaron just walk in there and make a sacrifice uhoh that wasn't the story was it God had done told him what to do to Aaron Aaron was Washed by the Water of the word Moses took step by step and you better believe if I'd have been Aaron I'd have said Moses did you leave out anything you know that's right did you forget one little thing because if it did I'm going to die washing of the water of the word what do you think we're doing here every service you're cleansed by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life cuz you just don't put the wash in by itself it's the blood of Life cover it that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church that don't sound right he said that you might find that in the almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the word in the word by the you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning and that's what the new birth does this is my message to the church now as we go off the hour just in a minute you're standing standing on if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every dot jot every tile where you're stand where you're standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from those Shucks them Shucks man's ideas and get out here into the wheat where you can get ripe before the sun I hear the coming of the combine that's the World Council of churches if you need that explanation you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah talk about of Thanksgiving he said I feel real good you are the the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you're perfect the blood of Jesus Christ how can you perfect Justified not just forgiven forgiven will not bring you the new birth you don't understand that word I used it if you're forgiven that's fine that's means you've done it that means a record still left of it that means it's all there but if you're Justified there's no record right could you try my daddy that died about 1945 could you trying for a crime today no why because he's been dead all them years but you see church that's what we need to be is dead to ourselves right and that's the new birth we're not talking about the great height of even stature of a perfect man and the doings and why you need Temperance and things we're talking about in the soul you're Eternal come on brothers in the soul of an individual that's born again you're Eternal there's no record did God take out and tear out the pages of Paul's letter where he admitted what he was no no you know our problem is one thing and I'll end it but this is a thought we condemn ourselves the greatest problem is self- condemnation yes we condemn ourselves yes when God don't condemn us you said the Lord condemn me I'll show you where the Prophet said you get condemned that that's fine well because he guilty but just remember if you bring condemnation to to far you're going to end it for all but just remember if you're born again it don't give you a license to steal that's still that old body and spirit ain't got nothing to do with the soul amen the soul is totally justified it means it never was guilty the real you is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's living inside of you that's the real you and that real you never did do anything you realize then why a lot of people never get born again is because they'll never accept what God has done right yes I I've seen thousands except Jesus Christ yeah but how come he didn't say except then you see Church the reason a lot of people are not saved is the same illustration they used those people in the book of Acts couldn't get that Holy Ghost to come on them people they had to send for somebody else somebody that knew amen that's right not that these others didn't know they had experienced it and were Christians themselves but what if some of them was James that there's two jameses in the book of Acts there in the scriptures James the Lesser and James the Greater you know what James wanted them to do now you say but that's not the whole story well you tell me the story suppose that was James James wanted them to get circumcised brother rman never said James wasn't a Christian he was a Christian but he wanted them to get circumcised he wanted the Apostle Paul to take a vow may not be James but it was one of them he said Paul would you take a vow and go through these things with it these to prove to them Pharisees that you're not against them Paul said I'll do anything he just never made it to the finish of The Vow read the book of Acts he never made it see because somebody come up and busted the whole story open Paul was going to go along with it but he was certainly going to tell them Pharisees about Jesus Christ that was his intentions I believe he said I'll go along with all this cleansing I'll go along with all this to show that I'm not against the law I don't think he would have went along with too much do you he'd got to preaching and he never would have make it do you understand yes why wouldn't that Holy Ghost come on those people somebody approached it wrong brother Rand said don't you get down there with them people and try to make them speak in tongues we don't never hear that quoted do we he said because you'll turn their mind paraphrasing it you'll get their mind off of what they're doing and they won't never get nothing from God but see we got all of that laying in our minds and our thoughts but I hope one thing comes out of this today if about this is five Services now spit on one thing we've got to be born again and if we're not born again our old book is still alive and we're not justified we may be forgiven but we're not totally justified but ever born again believer read it Prophet said ever born again believer stands totally justified as though you never done it that's right see that real you inside of there didn't do it that old you that old husband did but we got to be married Paul says in Romans are where was at that we may be able to be married to Christ Our first husband was our damic nature our second husband better be Jesus Christ let stand think on these things you mean God has the ability to just take a slate to where I've lived and see we we that's what we say we say we put it in the sea of forgetfulness but we don't then we want to illustrate that it's like a bottomless ocean want not illustrate the Forgiveness right what not illustrate that it's never in the memories of God why is that not Illustrated that God can't even remember it but we can remember what everybody does we just don't want to to remember what we done right we don't want people to remember what we done we want to remember what they done yes but my case is different oh you're a holy s you know righteous little person a you none of that's worth
