[26:42] verse 8.
[26:45] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning in
[26:48] the endings says the Lord which is which
[26:51] was and which is to come the almighty
[26:53] Hebrews 13 8 right
[26:55] I John who also am your brother and
[26:58] companion in Tribulation
[27:00] and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[27:03] Christ
[27:04] was in the aisle that is called patents
[27:06] for the word of God and for the
[27:08] testimony of Jesus Christ
[27:10] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[27:12] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[27:15] a trumpet remember not a not a trumpet
[27:18] but a voice
[27:19] with a great statement to be made what
[27:22] saying
[27:23] I am Alpha and Omega the first and the
[27:25] last
[27:26] and what thou seeest writing a book and
[27:28] send it unto the seven churches which
[27:31] are in Asia unto Ephesus unto somernia
[27:34] unto and unto pergamus and into
[27:39] Sardis enter to Philadelphia and under
[27:42] Lady of Sia and I turned to see the
[27:45] voice that spake with me and being
[27:47] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[27:50] and in the midst of the seven
[27:51] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[27:54] man clothed with a garment down to the
[27:57] foot and gird about the pouch
[28:00] with a golden girdle you may be seated
[28:02] the Lord have it his Blessing to the
[28:06] reading of the word now
[28:09] to try to continue our thought
[28:13] s
[28:14] of preparation for
[28:16] talking on the Sevenfold Glory of his
[28:19] person
[28:21] um
[28:22] just to back up just a little bit on
[28:24] this morning's message
[28:26] and to think about it that
[28:29] you know we were talking about the voice
[28:32] that is heard dire and you know
[28:36] we we know that God has a voice
[28:41] his voice is his word Okay then if
[28:44] anybody takes that word
[28:48] takes that word
[28:50] upon their lips and God reveals in their
[28:55] heart
[28:56] what is being said
[28:59] then the prophet said deity is speaking
[29:04] but see we don't want to go that way
[29:07] we're scared of that
[29:09] because we think you're going to go a
[29:11] little bit too far
[29:13] you know and get out on the wrong limb
[29:16] well which is the way to be
[29:19] get out on the limb or not even ever
[29:22] start up the tree
[29:24] you know I mean at least you're doing
[29:26] something and you know and just we think
[29:30] about it and think about the the voice
[29:32] of God speaking to us because I believe
[29:35] that's why that it says in the days of
[29:37] the voice of the seventh angel I believe
[29:40] God spoke to us
[29:42] by using man's lips to bring a message
[29:46] unto you and I
[29:48] all right straight from his hand To Us
[29:51] by way of the Prophet messenger all
[29:55] right and then see he's not here in a
[29:59] physical form you know
[30:01] God in a physical form or a bodily form
[30:05] he's now in his bride
[30:08] all right that is his last
[30:11] uh form right to the Gentiles the last
[30:15] in morphe the word it's the life form
[30:18] that he is to take to the Gentiles is
[30:22] the word made flesh in a group of people
[30:25] all right it first started by the
[30:29] prophet bringing the word but then
[30:32] someone must become that as I've always
[30:34] said about Martin Luther
[30:36] oh the Catholic Church didn't get very
[30:38] upset with him when he began to talk
[30:41] about the Jewish shall live by faith you
[30:44] know I mean they didn't like it but and
[30:46] they thought well you know we're losing
[30:48] one of our great guys that we've trained
[30:50] but when the people begin to walk in
[30:55] what the messenger brought
[30:58] see then is when the trouble came
[31:01] because they saw they was losing people
[31:03] all right now
[31:07] I've always believed that this message
[31:11] is supposed to be made alive
[31:13] all right now because the prophet
[31:17] brought it
[31:18] It Was Made Alive in his life
[31:21] all right we agree with that we believe
[31:24] that it was made alive in his day and
[31:27] and things and that was true but the
[31:30] message must live
[31:32] right it was made to be lived it was
[31:34] brought to be lived it was not just
[31:36] something that we well okay you know
[31:39] maybe we can or may no no you say well I
[31:42] just don't see it well then what are you
[31:45] looking for
[31:46] right
[31:47] I've tried to explain things and found
[31:50] wound up I guess making it a deeper I
[31:54] don't mean to deeper understand I'm
[31:55] making it deeper to be not understood by
[31:57] trying to explain it because you try to
[32:00] explain to people what you see a lot of
[32:03] times and you confuse them that much
[32:05] more
[32:06] because their mind is not thinking the
[32:09] way your mind is thinking
[32:11] and thereby it becomes confusion but
[32:14] I'll still keep right on doing the best
[32:16] I can trying to explain it and what I
[32:20] mean by explaining it
[32:22] you know I'm not talking about the way
[32:25] maybe you're talking I'm talking about
[32:27] things like you know uh people say I
[32:31] just don't see no uh no move of God
[32:36] you know I don't see things happening
[32:39] like it did in the book of Acts
[32:41] you know well
[32:44] I've always said it and I know that that
[32:46] when I say it people
[32:51] but you've changed places with us
[32:55] in the book of Acts people and I'd like
[32:56] to see what they would be doing
[32:59] I don't mean that derogatory
[33:01] I mean it from a heart of sincerity and
[33:04] love to try to express something to
[33:06] people
[33:08] that you bring those Apostles over here
[33:10] and put them here for about six months
[33:12] under the situation we live under I said
[33:15] just live under today in the hour of the
[33:18] spirits the pool to do into things and
[33:21] let them stay here about six months
[33:23] they'd probably say well let's be let's
[33:25] walk back
[33:26] you know because you know they didn't
[33:28] face a bunch of things like we do
[33:30] you know we're kind of like Paul was in
[33:33] his description you know of his doings
[33:36] that he was beat this he was thrown in
[33:39] this he was in the uh you know the sea
[33:42] he's done all the things
[33:43] you know all for the word of God
[33:47] well you know what he didn't have no
[33:49] problems with that
[33:51] he was happy
[33:53] and I'm happy to be here
[33:55] I am I'm really thrilled to be here in
[33:58] the end time where these things are
[34:00] taking place that may mean death to a
[34:03] lot of us
[34:05] but that's where people don't believe
[34:06] that see they don't think it's going to
[34:08] wind up well that's all right I'm not
[34:10] one to say that it will but I'm saying
[34:14] that you know uh what if it does
[34:18] I'd rather be prepared to know a little
[34:20] bit about it
[34:22] I'd rather have a couple of extra cans
[34:25] of green beans sitting in my house than
[34:27] to be like everybody
[34:29] don't
[34:30] just live by faith
[34:33] It really used to come by the house all
[34:35] the time like that you know just live by
[34:37] faith and
[34:39] yeah
[34:40] he liked to live off of our food and his
[34:42] faith
[34:46] a little dirty I guess but that's the
[34:49] way a lot of people want to do I
[34:50] remember brother
[34:51] Tatum or brother Moke telling about his
[34:53] brother coming through one time you're
[34:55] way back preaching you know live by
[34:58] faith
[34:59] no don't you know just live by faith
[35:03] and on Monday he come around upon his
[35:05] guitar to be able to
[35:07] you know move on well that's all right
[35:10] what if you're going to live by faith
[35:12] just go live
[35:13] if that's the way you're going to be uh
[35:16] I was reading what somebody sent me a
[35:18] little thing about you know and they
[35:20] said you know about a job being eight to
[35:24] twelve hours a day
[35:26] but their final statement was
[35:29] in other words if I do that I can't have
[35:31] the ministry
[35:33] well I don't see why you can't I preach
[35:36] eight and ten hour I mean worked eight
[35:39] and ten hours a day for many many years
[35:43] and preach three services a week
[35:47] you know
[35:48] I didn't have around no problems
[35:50] you know
[35:51] because that's but that's what we we
[35:54] think we're supposed to be The
[35:55] Minister's not supposed to work
[35:57] you know
[35:59] now if you can find me that in the Bible
[36:02] I'll be able to choke it down and eat it
[36:06] but I'm not worried about eating it
[36:08] because you're not going to find it
[36:09] right all right
[36:11] see that's uh the Lord Jesus worked
[36:14] until he got so far along into Ministry
[36:17] and uh you know
[36:19] Paul he worked until he got so far and
[36:22] you know then he's got where he couldn't
[36:25] work because he would just need well
[36:26] that's fine when you get where you could
[36:28] when it takes care of things amen you
[36:30] know
[36:31] but just move on but I'm trying to just
[36:34] say the point of that we get a concept
[36:38] about things
[36:40] and it's hard to get people to break
[36:43] away from that thought or that idea or
[36:46] concept that they have of what things
[36:48] are supposed to be you know all right
[36:53] but now let's get down to what we're
[36:54] talking about because we saw this
[36:56] morning and getting into it that the
[36:58] entire book is the revelation of Jesus
[37:00] Christ
[37:02] all right
[37:03] not just the Book of Revelations but
[37:05] that the Book of Revelation is a
[37:07] wonderful I wrote a very marvelous
[37:11] a point to consider
[37:13] that the fact of knowing that
[37:17] the Bible was written of God by his own
[37:20] hand but then when he would come to the
[37:22] Book of Revelations he would not just
[37:24] come down to and you know and do and
[37:28] right through the apostles and things
[37:30] but he would have purse would personally
[37:33] appear
[37:35] to John
[37:37] to write that's what we were talking
[37:39] about this morning when we're reading it
[37:41] we wrote around him says this is not a
[37:43] prophet here in Revelations 1.
[37:45] he said this is God all right well then
[37:48] I settled I don't care what you want to
[37:50] try to describe and do they say that
[37:52] it's forget it it's God
[37:55] right because that's what the prophet
[37:57] said it was all right now in doing that
[38:00] then we see that
[38:03] the the other writings of the Bible
[38:05] that's trying to express this morning I
[38:07] want to get that talk make sure you keep
[38:09] it the other writings yes it was God's
[38:12] finger
[38:14] that wrote it
[38:15] but the Book of Revelations was not his
[38:18] finger to write
[38:19] but he was personally appearing to a
[38:22] scribe to make sure
[38:25] I'm quoting brother Branham to make sure
[38:28] it was right
[38:30] he appears himself
[38:33] not even a prophet to ride it in the
[38:36] basis of a prophet to just get it like
[38:38] Paul and the different ones he comes
[38:41] himself personally
[38:44] two
[38:46] you know
[38:47] John
[38:49] to write
[38:51] all right now in doing that then he's
[38:54] putting his seal of approval upon it
[38:57] in his very first writings about it you
[39:01] know I used to I've told you this before
[39:04] but I always I always love to read but
[39:07] when his kids we didn't have much to
[39:09] read and all but I I always did hate to
[39:13] read books it was just so dull
[39:16] until it was just you know it was just
[39:20] they just signed a book we had to read
[39:22] it
[39:23] well that wasn't too bad because you
[39:25] could lie about where you read it or not
[39:27] you know
[39:28] right
[39:30] but
[39:32] then didn't want you to make a book
[39:34] report
[39:35] you remember that kids probably don't
[39:37] have to do those things now you know
[39:39] you got to make a book report
[39:42] well I hated it because I knew how dull
[39:44] the story was going to be so I'd read
[39:47] the little introduction at the front
[39:51] I'd get the characters and I'd get John
[39:53] and Mary and Susie and Joe and and I get
[39:57] them all you know find it out and then I
[40:00] would write my own book
[40:03] knowing the teacher 99 of the time never
[40:06] read the book or south
[40:11] because I got by
[40:13] all right I've done pretty good my
[40:15] sister loved her to do reports like that
[40:18] so sometimes I'd get her to do it I've
[40:20] done pretty good until I forgot one day
[40:22] to copy what she wrote me and turned her
[40:24] writing in and they got me but you know
[40:27] but my point is
[40:30] in writing
[40:33] in writing is a wonderful thing
[40:36] you know I love to read stories that
[40:40] have that will keep you interested
[40:43] you know
[40:45] the right real true writers will keep
[40:47] you you know tied with it Spellbound as
[40:50] we call uh on the writing well to me
[40:53] that's what the Book of Revelations is
[40:55] it's spellbinding to the human mind once
[40:58] you see
[41:00] who the characters are
[41:03] and you realize that hey
[41:05] this is talking about me
[41:09] this is what God
[41:12] 2 000 years ago
[41:15] wrote down
[41:16] that I would be
[41:19] or this somebody would be it and why
[41:22] can't I believe I'm that person
[41:27] why can't I believe it especially when
[41:29] it begins to unfold
[41:32] unto me amen you know to be part of me I
[41:37] get excited
[41:39] you know about it and then I want to
[41:41] turn over real quick to the back of the
[41:43] book don't you I want to know about John
[41:46] and Mary if they live happily ever after
[41:48] you know
[41:50] I want to get to the more into the story
[41:52] but then I realized the way the Bible is
[41:55] reading written that we must go step at
[41:58] a time
[42:00] because that's the way God reveals it
[42:03] all right
[42:04] it's a very marvelous thing to look at
[42:07] the Book of Revelations and to be able
[42:10] to find yourself
[42:13] written therein
[42:16] all right
[42:17] Jesus appearing personally to a scribe
[42:20] to write
[42:24] and not letting even a prophet write it
[42:28] it came himself
[42:31] that's wonderful all right
[42:33] see he wants us to know who he is
[42:39] and I wrote sure s-u-r-e
[42:41] in other words make sure you understand
[42:45] then he wants us to see who
[42:49] we are
[42:52] and by that we will see where he is
[42:57] all right
[42:59] now I made a statement this morning that
[43:02] maybe some of you younger ones may not
[43:04] really think about too much but you know
[43:06] what that once this once God unites with
[43:10] his people in some way somewhere one of
[43:14] these days if not already
[43:16] it's going to be that you're not going
[43:18] to be able to find God
[43:20] unless you find the people
[43:26] now I believe that
[43:28] you said well God can just drop down
[43:30] yeah but that's not exactly the way he
[43:34] chooses
[43:37] and you know what if he chooses it to be
[43:39] that way you know what that's the way
[43:41] it's going to be if he chooses it to be
[43:44] that the people is to describe it or
[43:46] bring it out then that's the way it's
[43:47] going to be show me in the book of Acts
[43:49] where anybody's out over here
[43:51] without a Bible without any form without
[43:55] anything so we'll be in the Bible
[43:56] anywhere somebody off by their self and
[43:59] God just drops down and speaks to them
[44:00] and they get up and run over here and no
[44:03] no
[44:05] now come on I said with the Bible or
[44:07] some form right
[44:10] right he's always got a contractor goes
[44:12] I the way I understand the Bible
[44:15] and the description the prophet gave
[44:18] is that the
[44:20] word comes through the body
[44:24] and see then if the word comes through
[44:25] the body you're not going to get it
[44:27] outside the body
[44:29] when I got this or I got that that's all
[44:32] right amen what would you get it all
[44:34] right all right well I got to have a
[44:36] book oh
[44:37] you just trapped your own
[44:40] you read what somebody said
[44:43] You Heard a Voice
[44:44] that was speaking through the writing of
[44:47] someone
[44:50] because the
[44:51] the seed comes through the body right
[44:53] all right see then in that way
[44:57] we know what God is trying to do he's
[44:59] trying to get us
[45:02] to come to a realization
[45:05] of the hour that we're living
[45:09] and what it means and what's happened
[45:11] Among Us
[45:14] you know
[45:16] to see that we
[45:18] as I said can sit down and read the
[45:21] Bible
[45:22] where it used to be so confusing don't
[45:25] you remember when you first read it
[45:28] well you had a guard up in heaven and
[45:30] one over the ocean and one Over Yonder
[45:32] and you just had God's running every
[45:34] which way and you couldn't figure out
[45:36] what everything was and
[45:38] then you got into what does that mean
[45:40] like I said my brother-in-law was a
[45:42] Baptist preacher that Beast to him was a
[45:44] great big thing raised up out of the
[45:46] ocean and King Kong
[45:49] I said nothing deceiving about that
[45:53] but to him that
[45:55] yeah
[45:57] all right
[45:59] see God was happy
[46:02] listen
[46:04] in him throughout the fullness of the
[46:06] God had bottled him
[46:08] God was pleased to come down and dwell
[46:10] in that man that we talk about and call
[46:12] his name Jesus
[46:13] all right
[46:15] you know by his giving of his life and
[46:18] the new birth God is happy to come down
[46:21] and dwell in you and I
[46:26] right
[46:27] happy to do
[46:31] because it's fulfilling what he always
[46:33] wanted
[46:34] all right
[46:37] but when it comes down to the final age
[46:40] that we're living in
[46:42] in this final age
[46:45] he leaves no loopholes
[46:49] because he comes down and shows himself
[46:53] in the midst
[46:55] of the seven Church ages
[46:57] like unto the son of man
[47:00] now we've got to cut something right
[47:02] here slice it and lay it in order in the
[47:06] scriptures or we will begin to get out
[47:08] of order with it and not realize it
[47:12] now John was taken to Patmos
[47:16] to show him to write right
[47:20] all right now where was the church
[47:24] when John was writing
[47:27] a lot of it hadn't even come into being
[47:29] yet right
[47:31] as a matter of fact 1895-96 would have
[47:34] just been partially over into the first
[47:36] church age
[47:37] because it started about 53 A.D all
[47:41] right
[47:42] my point
[47:45] we've got to first see
[47:48] ourselves on Earth
[47:52] he said no no no we we need to see
[47:54] ourselves in heaven
[47:58] well how did you get there
[48:01] question number one I
[48:03] don't remember
[48:04] if we come back to earth
[48:08] and see where he's at now
[48:14] on Earth
[48:15] then we can look into the heavenlies and
[48:18] see the 10 15 years ago matching pieces
[48:22] series that I tried to bring
[48:24] because just trying to show it then on
[48:27] one point what that when on Earth
[48:30] we match
[48:32] what is in God's mind
[48:34] of what is to be then we'll go there
[48:38] all right
[48:40] but we must see first here so let's
[48:43] don't go into the heavenly's too far
[48:46] okay
[48:49] I know I require for you to stop and
[48:51] think with me and that's what I want you
[48:52] to do
[48:53] so when you stay down here on Earth
[48:56] all right
[48:57] what was that old thing about the two
[49:00] Earthly minded be it in Heavenly good
[49:02] and Heavenly minded being in Earthly
[49:04] good yeah uh
[49:06] think about it
[49:09] John was seeing
[49:12] what would take place upon the Earth
[49:17] will you go with me
[49:20] John was seeing that even though he was
[49:23] taking up
[49:26] the
[49:27] into the Lord's Day
[49:33] but still there's no need of being in
[49:36] the Lord's day if you don't know how you
[49:38] got there
[49:39] is that carnal enough
[49:42] you know blood enough
[49:45] let's find out how to get there
[49:47] then we can Rejoice because we're going
[49:50] to be rejoicing about what we've done on
[49:51] Earth
[49:53] which that's what everybody wants to do
[49:54] they just want to run along in one of
[49:56] these days don't vacuum go
[49:59] and while we're up in heaven we're just
[50:00] happy and we're just everything so
[50:03] wonderful
[50:04] no
[50:08] I believe those down through the Dark
[50:10] Ages that faced
[50:12] blinds and
[50:14] died in the arenas
[50:18] I think maybe they might have
[50:21] they might understand
[50:24] all right
[50:26] so John is seeing first
[50:30] if he's to write what he sees
[50:33] he's to write it and send it to the
[50:36] seven Church Ages which would be on
[50:39] earth
[50:40] you go with me
[50:42] all right then if he's going to send it
[50:45] to the Earth
[50:49] now you can pick up a little bit and
[50:51] understand why that you would be
[50:53] speaking of the bride of Christ being
[50:55] the son of man
[50:57] you jump up in the heaven real quick
[50:59] look what you've left out
[51:02] you know
[51:04] yeah but
[51:06] but brother day are we you're talking
[51:09] like it's required that we uh understand
[51:12] what's going on well
[51:15] what else is it to be
[51:18] you know
[51:19] I mean you got a ticket in your hand
[51:21] wait on a bus to pull up to take you to
[51:23] heaven
[51:25] and somebody's going to flip a switch
[51:29] no when when when what is on Earth
[51:34] matches what is already shown to be in
[51:38] heaven
[51:40] we go there
[51:42] Now isn't that a marvelous thing
[51:46] to be able to sit here and read
[51:48] of what you and I
[51:51] are going to be
[51:56] before we leave here
[51:59] and not to make it as some form of
[52:04] oh it's going to be I could just see it
[52:06] we're just going we're just going to
[52:08] take over and we're just going to rule
[52:11] the world
[52:12] well that won't fit too much
[52:15] you know that Spirit won't work too good
[52:18] at all
[52:19] you know that's that's not God all right
[52:22] but to say that we are the if we were
[52:25] covering this morning we are the final
[52:27] voice
[52:29] uh the voice and the person is the same
[52:31] as we were trying to cover and like unto
[52:34] the son of man in other words just
[52:36] exactly like him because it's the same
[52:39] God just in a different body
[52:43] this time he's in a member many membered
[52:46] body whereas once he was walking in one
[52:48] body
[52:50] now he's in the bride around the world
[52:53] fulfilling his word
[52:56] and bringing to pass the things as the
[52:59] people begin to eat the word
[53:02] and become the word
[53:04] I just don't see nothing going on
[53:08] well
[53:10] all right
[53:13] at least you're honest
[53:16] might not be too much of good but
[53:18] honestly
[53:20] but
[53:22] as I said to start with what would
[53:25] happen if you changed positions
[53:28] I mean you don't you don't get that I'm
[53:30] sure in my mind this goes crazy in these
[53:33] things I'm sorry but I think about it
[53:38] you notice your lord Jesus faced
[53:40] uh Pharisees Sadducees and herodians
[53:44] that was basically the three groups you
[53:47] got in some more little flings ends and
[53:50] the thing but basically you'd still
[53:52] wouldn't have one handful
[53:54] and we face
[53:57] 969 is what the prophet was calling it
[54:00] plus about 2 000 in the message
[54:03] and that's probably a small number
[54:06] of demons that we face
[54:10] all right
[54:11] we preach these like I love to do it and
[54:13] decide you remember that
[54:16] under Eichmann and Hitler and Mussolini
[54:18] and all that Spirit was loosed on the
[54:21] Jews to drive them to the Homeland right
[54:24] and brother random was talking there in
[54:26] 16 24 right along in that on that
[54:30] message and he said 20 years later
[54:33] which if you put it 48 see as to them
[54:36] returning to their homelands or whatever
[54:38] 50 40 affected still he said 20 years
[54:41] later it's loose on the bride
[54:45] well you know what he could see them
[54:47] demons already loosed
[54:50] and there to drive us to what
[54:53] the message of the hour
[54:59] very simple point
[55:03] the prophet then when the seals broke
[55:05] he saw those demons and those things
[55:10] and like I've always told you when he
[55:12] got into that four seal he was going to
[55:14] speak on Armageddon I remember first
[55:16] time reading that and I said well I was
[55:18] reading oh I was really man I'm gonna
[55:21] get over here and I'm gonna be able to
[55:22] tell them guys at work where Russia
[55:24] comes from China comes from it's come
[55:26] this comes in because it always talked
[55:29] about it the Pentecostal preachers you
[55:31] know the King of the North or the Syrian
[55:34] that would come down huh thought I'd be
[55:37] able to explain
[55:41] when he finished that he said see he
[55:43] said them demons said them Supernatural
[55:46] he said they're Protestants and
[55:48] Catholics
[55:51] coming together after the little bride
[55:54] and I go phew
[55:59] I mean I thought I was going to be able
[56:01] to explain it
[56:03] didn't even have a quote
[56:07] but you see that Prophet saw all them
[56:09] time
[56:10] but you know what else he saw
[56:13] he saw a bride that would become that
[56:16] that's what I like
[56:18] and regardless of what we think that we
[56:21] don't see this we don't see that God to
[56:24] that Prophet saw a bride that would
[56:27] become the word and he spoke of her
[56:32] you said this prophet in the Malachi 4
[56:34] will be pointing to the skies at a word
[56:36] born bride
[56:40] as I said this morning listen to the
[56:42] tapes and read the books and listen to
[56:45] him describing how beautiful we are in
[56:47] the eyes of God
[56:51] every message is in there with one way
[56:53] or the other
[56:54] speaking on it
[56:56] you remember that message after a red
[56:58] warning or something got a tape you know
[57:00] called invasion of the U.S one man I
[57:03] held that tape I run home and I put it
[57:06] on there we're gonna say it meets real
[57:08] down there
[57:09] and just see them boats coming
[57:14] maybe while he got preaching about
[57:16] spirits and Catholics and Protestants
[57:19] and things that really I wanted to turn
[57:21] the tape off
[57:22] foreign
[57:23] I don't mind talking straight and
[57:25] honestly I just I was downhearted I
[57:29] thought I was gonna find out some great
[57:30] big things
[57:31] but then I did find it out
[57:35] you know I began to realize like no
[57:37] fourth sealed those demons coming from
[57:40] Protestants and Catholics if we met
[57:43] right now on the battlefield do you know
[57:45] that in World War One
[57:47] they had the Germans had on their belt
[57:50] buckle In God We Trust
[57:55] if we met today
[57:59] you guys have been in there anymore you
[58:01] had to look down there and it said What
[58:03] Faith to you are you Catholics or
[58:05] Protestants or whatever you know
[58:08] what if you met today and you have all
[58:10] them armies coming over a record they
[58:11] need to be Catholics or Protestants
[58:14] you know in Russia would be doing the
[58:15] same thing
[58:16] but you understand what I'm getting at
[58:19] see we think we've got it figured out
[58:25] when we come to find out we're not even
[58:26] in the ballpark
[58:28] because we're not where the Prophet was
[58:30] talking of the things
[58:32] in his description of it
[58:35] in his description fits about his
[58:38] description fits the Bible because
[58:40] that's where it came from
[58:43] and he talked about the bride being the
[58:46] final voice to the final age
[58:48] under her messenger yeah
[58:52] that she would be the final voice
[58:55] that he has no voice but yours and mine
[58:58] he has no feet
[59:00] he has no hands
[59:05] do you need that quote if you do go
[59:06] ahead number three two pull up number
[59:09] three I think
[59:10] two or three
[59:15] which is here ye him
[59:17] Jesus has no eyes tonight but mine
[59:21] and years of on Earth he has no hands
[59:23] but mine and yours he has no voice but
[59:26] mine and yours
[59:29] you mean he has did he thinks so much of
[59:33] us
[59:35] until he has committed to you and I
[59:42] the opportunity
[59:46] to
[59:48] describe him
[59:54] what about that
[59:56] Arizona
[1:00:00] the ability to describe him
[1:00:06] you realize you're talking of one God
[1:00:08] and trying to show people in times that
[1:00:10] you're describing God
[1:00:14] and that's not that away
[1:00:16] you're describing God to what you see
[1:00:19] that's why it's so hard to put it into
[1:00:22] words
[1:00:23] because you know and realize that a lot
[1:00:25] of times you try to put it in what the
[1:00:26] prophet said which I I don't get a
[1:00:29] chance to talk too much anymore but when
[1:00:31] I used to work and if I you know I would
[1:00:33] think when I start talking to somebody I
[1:00:36] was sitting there thinking what is the
[1:00:39] prophets say well did the prophet say
[1:00:42] and I just
[1:00:44] you know it was like that
[1:00:47] well that was well and good but one day
[1:00:49] I realized they want to know what I'm
[1:00:51] talking about right because God told me
[1:00:54] one day so don't tell me no more what
[1:00:55] that Prophet said tell me what you say
[1:00:58] right and uh it's okay
[1:01:01] but are you with me
[1:01:03] a final description of himself
[1:01:08] because we are the the final voice to
[1:01:11] the final age we are the uh final form
[1:01:15] of God to the Gentile dispensation
[1:01:17] that's right all right and then this
[1:01:19] description of itself is describing not
[1:01:24] and listen
[1:01:25] I know you try to build something up and
[1:01:27] then you say something people just
[1:01:29] you talk funny I guess I do
[1:01:32] it's not describing me and you
[1:01:37] he's describing himself
[1:01:40] right but the thing of it is he's in you
[1:01:43] and I
[1:01:47] right
[1:01:48] Paul said it's Christ in the hope of
[1:01:51] glory
[1:01:54] where do we get on over that glory and
[1:01:57] all of that
[1:01:58] seven full Glory
[1:02:00] see
[1:02:03] he's describing it as he does
[1:02:06] oh go ahead number five
[1:02:08] brother
[1:02:10] now the paragraph 221 of the invisible
[1:02:13] Union 65 11 25. and look what he says
[1:02:17] the same grain that went into the ground
[1:02:19] the same Jesus in The Bride form
[1:02:23] same power same church same thing same
[1:02:26] word
[1:02:31] and see there's where it goes back what
[1:02:33] I just don't see it
[1:02:35] well
[1:02:37] you know what let me quote brother
[1:02:39] random and I'm sorry to quote it but you
[1:02:41] know what he said he says not for you
[1:02:45] we don't want to quote that quote do we
[1:02:48] that's what he said he said if you can't
[1:02:51] see it and you can't believe it it's not
[1:02:52] for you
[1:02:55] what
[1:02:56] I'd at least shut up about saying I
[1:02:59] don't see it
[1:03:00] right you know
[1:03:02] right
[1:03:03] because you know what I'm doing when I'm
[1:03:05] saying I don't see it I'm admitting I
[1:03:06] don't see it
[1:03:08] and by admitting I don't see it that
[1:03:09] means I ain't part of it
[1:03:12] let me
[1:03:15] hit this
[1:03:17] who was it one of the Great
[1:03:19] men down through time there he said
[1:03:21] preach Faith until you get Faith
[1:03:27] all right
[1:03:28] but you see it
[1:03:32] then he's talking about a bride form
[1:03:36] a bride standing there in Revelations 1.
[1:03:43] one standing in the midst of the seven
[1:03:45] golden candles we follow that point
[1:03:48] as being the church ages and the things
[1:03:50] and he said why are we here
[1:03:52] all right
[1:03:54] but where is he at
[1:03:58] he's in her manifesting himself
[1:04:02] the way he wants it
[1:04:04] all right
[1:04:08] didn't we stopped this morning we got to
[1:04:10] the point I had to cut it off
[1:04:13] it said one standing in the Mr Seven
[1:04:15] gold candlesticks
[1:04:17] gird about the pouch with a golden girl
[1:04:21] all right
[1:04:23] now Pat 's means feminists does not mean
[1:04:25] masculine
[1:04:27] but it is a description
[1:04:29] now listen
[1:04:32] you must make it a description of the
[1:04:34] high priest
[1:04:36] especially when we get on over into the
[1:04:39] the uh girdle and how it is done
[1:04:42] because John had a girdle
[1:04:45] the Bible says
[1:04:47] I think his was leather
[1:04:49] uh Paul had a girdle
[1:04:53] if they took off of him and gird him and
[1:04:55] said they'll do this to you when you go
[1:04:57] to Rome
[1:04:58] see it was a customary thing
[1:05:01] it was simply a peace
[1:05:04] where the men and the women now used it
[1:05:08] to kind of pull things in
[1:05:10] it's not they flop out
[1:05:13] you know and I do pretty good if I'm
[1:05:16] holding my breath
[1:05:17] but I have to breathe
[1:05:20] and I certainly don't want a girdle
[1:05:23] all right
[1:05:25] because that's all that's what the words
[1:05:26] mean
[1:05:28] all right and in some of the forms of
[1:05:31] the girdles it goes back to a uh it was
[1:05:35] a place where people carried money you
[1:05:37] called them money belts
[1:05:40] you know
[1:05:41] but they would do that evidently in
[1:05:44] Bible times would carry the money in
[1:05:47] that because you know that was a place
[1:05:50] of of I guess rolling it up in there and
[1:05:54] it would not just be one like now that
[1:05:56] you got the thing and you put your foot
[1:05:58] in the back and you pull the strings you
[1:06:00] know the lady goes in and then you time
[1:06:03] it wouldn't basically that way
[1:06:07] it was just a
[1:06:09] a something that was a part of your
[1:06:11] garment
[1:06:13] and I don't know where you men know this
[1:06:14] and mostly women are probably say I'm
[1:06:16] crazy you know that a belt is not to
[1:06:18] hold your pants up
[1:06:20] who knows that
[1:06:22] none of you
[1:06:24] no you know
[1:06:29] they had suspenders for that
[1:06:33] is a decorative piece
[1:06:37] all right
[1:06:39] let it hold my breaches up
[1:06:43] now some of these kids today
[1:06:46] they need some long suspenders okay all
[1:06:49] right just giving you a little see I did
[1:06:52] try to look up the girls and things and
[1:06:55] you know and to find out
[1:06:56] and for this next few minutes you've got
[1:06:58] to depend on the profit not her own
[1:07:01] assumptions
[1:07:02] okay
[1:07:04] we can assume assume and we can talk
[1:07:07] about it but
[1:07:09] it still doesn't mean very much
[1:07:12] uh we're gonna have to depend on what he
[1:07:14] says okay all right so we'll do it that
[1:07:17] way all right but now look
[1:07:24] it's shown as gerd about the paps
[1:07:28] now anybody who you know knows what that
[1:07:30] is that's feminist women that blessed
[1:07:33] are the Pops that never gave suck Etc
[1:07:35] everybody knows that
[1:07:37] all right when we get to it in a minute
[1:07:39] the girdle is moved from the place of
[1:07:43] servant
[1:07:45] to the place of Judge
[1:07:48] all right
[1:07:49] go
[1:07:50] we're going to read those things and uh
[1:07:53] but
[1:07:55] first get is Gert about to pass meaning
[1:07:58] it's a feminist form it is the Bride of
[1:08:00] Jesus Christ
[1:08:02] God thought enough of that to put it in
[1:08:04] his Bible
[1:08:06] that he would distinguish
[1:08:08] things
[1:08:09] I love
[1:08:11] one like
[1:08:13] unto the son of man
[1:08:16] see then I'm not looking for the son of
[1:08:19] man
[1:08:23] right right
[1:08:24] I'm looking first whatever that son of
[1:08:27] man represents or is in that way but I'm
[1:08:31] looking at it in another form
[1:08:35] because I would be looking at one person
[1:08:39] all right
[1:08:44] and see then
[1:08:46] it's good about the past meaning it's
[1:08:48] feminism it's a feminist description
[1:08:52] all right
[1:08:53] now how can you bring that down to Human
[1:08:56] terminologies
[1:08:58] to uh Define
[1:09:01] the point
[1:09:03] uh I'll save you the trouble don't do a
[1:09:06] lot of of uh guessing
[1:09:10] because you'll try to make it the
[1:09:12] breastplate of error
[1:09:14] no
[1:09:16] no
[1:09:18] that's not the judgment
[1:09:22] you'll try to make it this kind of
[1:09:24] doings or that thing you know so
[1:09:26] just make it what it is and the way the
[1:09:28] prophet says
[1:09:31] that when you dress that high priest
[1:09:34] before he put on the breastplates and
[1:09:36] the different things
[1:09:38] before that was put on he already had
[1:09:41] this girdle
[1:09:42] around his waist
[1:09:45] to hold his clothes in
[1:09:48] you know
[1:09:50] and it was made out of material but yet
[1:09:53] probably dipped in gold or something
[1:09:56] because oh you wouldn't make it out of a
[1:09:58] pure gold thing but you got to define
[1:10:01] the way that you're reading it because
[1:10:03] it'll sound like it's gold and it'll
[1:10:05] sound like it's some kind of linen so
[1:10:07] just put it together and get it right
[1:10:09] and just take your linen and dip it in
[1:10:11] the gold and put it around you
[1:10:13] all right you've got the description of
[1:10:16] the Bible terminology
[1:10:18] but it was pretty
[1:10:21] hold of things and uh it was made to
[1:10:25] worry that they were other things up
[1:10:27] above would not be able to move
[1:10:31] it was kind of like holding things in
[1:10:34] place
[1:10:35] and and just to sell you in plain
[1:10:37] language uh it would mean like if you
[1:10:40] had a thing down here holding your your
[1:10:43] garment in you know and then things
[1:10:46] would go inside but it's not referring
[1:10:48] to that but I'm describing it and it
[1:10:50] wouldn't fall out
[1:10:51] but that was the purpose of the Curious
[1:10:54] girdle
[1:10:56] and you'll find it called out and you'll
[1:10:58] find it called girdle and it was part of
[1:11:01] the
[1:11:03] um
[1:11:03] attire or the garments that the high
[1:11:07] priests wore
[1:11:08] other people wore them
[1:11:11] all right
[1:11:12] and then everybody wound up with them
[1:11:15] because it was good
[1:11:17] to have you know
[1:11:19] all right
[1:11:20] keep kind of things in place
[1:11:23] and I sure liked it because I remember
[1:11:25] reading this part and I said if you
[1:11:27] worked with you worked they had shorter
[1:11:29] garments which he wore and the longer
[1:11:31] garments well it didn't write in there
[1:11:33] about this but I I got one of my own
[1:11:37] if I was down there with a big old
[1:11:38] garment and it spread a way out
[1:11:41] and a big old bar got after me
[1:11:44] I know what would happen
[1:11:46] most of my garment would go inside my
[1:11:48] girdle and I'd run
[1:11:50] right
[1:11:52] he's had a lot of purposes for it
[1:11:55] but not those things maybe for the high
[1:11:57] priest
[1:11:58] all right because it was part that he
[1:12:01] had to go through and it tells you what
[1:12:03] they're in in Exodus and you know even
[1:12:07] in Leviticus and going over as to what
[1:12:10] these were all right now
[1:12:13] get to the point it says it's gird about
[1:12:15] the pouch
[1:12:16] with a golden girdle
[1:12:20] now
[1:12:22] see we don't have the definition written
[1:12:24] out in the scriptures that have said
[1:12:26] so we have to go with the the uh part we
[1:12:30] just have the writings about it so then
[1:12:33] we have to to go because I said if you
[1:12:35] start trying to do it the long try it
[1:12:37] you'll find out you'll just go hey we're
[1:12:39] trying to figure out where all this runs
[1:12:41] and what all this runs to and I could
[1:12:43] not find one connection between the uh
[1:12:47] girdle that was here and moving it up to
[1:12:51] be something in the judgment
[1:12:55] best we could do was come up with a
[1:12:56] defining of maybe two pictures waiting
[1:12:59] and found them I had looked at them but
[1:13:00] they've got a couple so brother Joe if
[1:13:03] you'll pull up one of them let us look
[1:13:04] at it you know we can get a little idea
[1:13:06] about maybe uh the Garment
[1:13:10] because it's first down here
[1:13:13] and then it can be moved they do growl
[1:13:16] out
[1:13:17] some things of what they think it looks
[1:13:20] like
[1:13:21] and they do draw one
[1:13:24] with the girdle put right across here
[1:13:28] right
[1:13:29] would sound like it fitting but
[1:13:32] you know not necessarily
[1:13:34] all right
[1:13:36] but look
[1:13:38] that you've got a
[1:13:40] you know the golden size they call it
[1:13:43] but you can see that it's
[1:13:46] across the breast
[1:13:48] when it's connecting up on the shoulders
[1:13:51] all right
[1:13:52] that may be a point
[1:13:54] look at the next one the other one
[1:13:57] and see it has it just as a
[1:14:00] shoulder garment
[1:14:04] you know whatever it is
[1:14:08] you'll read here we will what the
[1:14:10] prophet says that it's
[1:14:12] in one position it means servant
[1:14:18] like I said if you were getting down to
[1:14:20] wash somebody's feet you could just take
[1:14:22] your garments stick it down into your
[1:14:25] thing that was around just called a sash
[1:14:27] it's called different things and you
[1:14:30] could go about your doings all right
[1:14:32] but I'm not concerned about whether they
[1:14:36] fit it correctly
[1:14:37] you know and what it is I'm more
[1:14:40] concerned with staying with what the
[1:14:43] prophet has to say in a definition so
[1:14:46] let's read it
[1:14:47] we'll get these we won't spend too much
[1:14:49] time on it but we'll we'll read a few
[1:14:52] things
[1:14:54] are we done been through that it's a you
[1:14:56] know the gird about the pouch we know
[1:14:58] what the pouts are
[1:15:00] and and the girdle but let's read this
[1:15:02] going up to number eight
[1:15:04] Brothers
[1:15:06] and let's read what it says about this
[1:15:09] what the prophet has to say
[1:15:12] all right
[1:15:13] taken from Patton's vision
[1:15:16] um 1960 1204 paragraph 183 come to the
[1:15:20] Ancient of Days who hired with white as
[1:15:22] wool and John turned and he saw one like
[1:15:26] the son of man standing in the midst of
[1:15:27] the seven golden candlesticks with Snow
[1:15:30] White hair
[1:15:31] that's not in the Bible right
[1:15:34] because he's describing the judge
[1:15:37] with the rest of the Bible he's telling
[1:15:39] you what that looks like
[1:15:41] all right
[1:15:43] with us know what hired the judge not
[1:15:46] girded around the waist but girded
[1:15:48] around the pouch up here a lot you'd
[1:15:50] want to move it across this way and do
[1:15:53] but what and a judge with the size of
[1:15:56] the judge over his shoulder
[1:15:59] all right
[1:16:01] he stood with a girdle pure holy refined
[1:16:04] girdle that was held that held his
[1:16:06] righteousness his cover he was covered
[1:16:08] all the way to the feet watch the
[1:16:10] Sevenfold Glory of his manifestation all
[1:16:13] right now look at the next one
[1:16:16] Patmos Vision which would be page 53
[1:16:20] Church age book
[1:16:22] there he stands one like unto the son of
[1:16:24] man as the jewel is beautified by the
[1:16:26] mounting of the ring so he is glorified
[1:16:29] in the midst of the churches it is the
[1:16:32] Lord's day for John sees him standing
[1:16:34] not his priest but as the coming judge
[1:16:37] the golden girdle is no longer gird
[1:16:40] around the waist or the priest must
[1:16:43] worry it as he ministers to God in the
[1:16:45] holiest place but it is now around his
[1:16:48] shoulders for he is not he is not known
[1:16:52] not now the priest but the judge
[1:16:56] all right so it goes all the way over
[1:16:58] to where it's at
[1:17:01] all right
[1:17:02] now I clipped this to her this morning
[1:17:06] with talking about the things and I'll
[1:17:09] encourage you not to go into Paul about
[1:17:12] the breastplate of righteousness and and
[1:17:16] the different things you won't get the
[1:17:17] the the things that uh you know will be
[1:17:21] fitting to what you're talking about
[1:17:23] because it was a girdle and it was moved
[1:17:27] it was put in another position if that
[1:17:30] high priest walked out from behind that
[1:17:33] Veil
[1:17:36] all right he went in with it here go to
[1:17:39] be service you know offering the
[1:17:41] sacrifices if he walked out from behind
[1:17:43] that veil with that
[1:17:47] girdle in a different place
[1:17:49] they knew trouble wasn't him
[1:17:53] right
[1:17:54] any time that he would
[1:17:56] in his service that he would be working
[1:17:58] and all at once he would change and put
[1:18:00] it in another place
[1:18:03] it would mean judgment
[1:18:05] is at hand
[1:18:08] all right
[1:18:09] now
[1:18:12] but what I want you to think about is
[1:18:14] what we're connecting it together with
[1:18:16] that John is seeing the Bride of Jesus
[1:18:19] Christ
[1:18:20] all right
[1:18:22] and he's seeing her on Earth
[1:18:30] scripture
[1:18:33] you remember Jesus God
[1:18:36] gave no judgment
[1:18:41] he placed it in the hands of his son
[1:18:45] you remember that I'm gonna give you the
[1:18:46] scripture I got it laid here somewhere
[1:18:48] it was in the hands of his son he had no
[1:18:51] uh no doings
[1:18:54] all right
[1:18:58] I got it laid in here somewhere but
[1:19:00] anybody ought to know what I'm sorry in
[1:19:01] the scripture it's in the hands of his
[1:19:04] son
[1:19:05] well now
[1:19:07] where is the why are you dealing with
[1:19:10] these shoulders
[1:19:16] why would you not stop on just the paps
[1:19:23] because you wouldn't have the judgment
[1:19:27] that's what I told you without the
[1:19:28] divide it divide it with a hair
[1:19:31] because it's gird about the pounds to
[1:19:34] represent feminism
[1:19:37] but you've got to bring it across the
[1:19:38] shoulders right
[1:19:40] right irregardless of what you do
[1:19:42] because what did he say in Isaiah
[1:19:45] the government shall be upon what his
[1:19:49] shoulders
[1:19:50] all right there's no judgment of God God
[1:19:53] has no judgment it's the son that does
[1:19:55] the judge him
[1:19:57] all right now if the son does the
[1:19:59] judging then where's the Sun
[1:20:03] he's in US
[1:20:05] now who's going to judge a world
[1:20:07] according to Corinthians
[1:20:11] right
[1:20:13] does it not say that
[1:20:15] the Saints shall judge the Earth
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:21] why
[1:20:22] because if you look at the pyramid it is
[1:20:25] drawn out
[1:20:28] don't bring us up no further this would
[1:20:31] be the neck that'd be the head so here's
[1:20:34] the shoulders
[1:20:36] the body
[1:20:38] the body right
[1:20:41] imposed our superimpose a picture you
[1:20:44] would put the neck and you'd put the
[1:20:46] head
[1:20:46] and you'd have the body of Christ
[1:20:50] you know that in every age mankind has
[1:20:54] been judged or willing to watch our own
[1:20:56] you know going on down I mean it's
[1:20:57] passed on we know that but you get the
[1:20:59] right story
[1:21:01] but each age that word that was in that
[1:21:03] age could never age
[1:21:06] right you follow me
[1:21:09] every age is judged by the word of the
[1:21:12] people they hear
[1:21:15] the Ephesus Earth Church age won't have
[1:21:17] to answer for what the Ephesians has to
[1:21:20] answer
[1:21:22] when you realize what you are
[1:21:25] when you go out to her
[1:21:30] you realize that this your own life
[1:21:34] that you're just living out of
[1:21:37] you know
[1:21:39] being a Christian
[1:21:42] and you sisters you go out and you have
[1:21:44] your long hair you don't have the pain
[1:21:46] on your face you don't have the things
[1:21:47] like that you realize you're judging
[1:21:50] those people
[1:21:53] of course a lot of people will say well
[1:21:55] let's put on a little makeup where we
[1:21:57] won't judge them
[1:21:58] well you go ahead because you wound up
[1:22:00] falling on their sides now you're lost
[1:22:03] sorry
[1:22:05] oh hell no playgrounds No Gray areas
[1:22:08] that way
[1:22:09] mm-hmm
[1:22:11] you realize the clothes that you're
[1:22:13] wearing
[1:22:14] you know the dresses the clothes that
[1:22:17] you women are wearing
[1:22:19] that every one of them women out there
[1:22:21] will be judged by it
[1:22:23] that sees that
[1:22:27] you don't have to preach
[1:22:30] you don't have to stand on a street
[1:22:31] corner and holler and scream all about
[1:22:32] all the things you just walk down
[1:22:34] through Walmart
[1:22:36] right
[1:22:38] remember Wade in June and
[1:22:41] brother you know
[1:22:43] and they were just going down an alley
[1:22:44] and here he goes and he's been here a
[1:22:46] few times and he goes down and he
[1:22:52] where do y'all go to church
[1:22:59] no a lot of women wear long clothes
[1:23:03] who is that dog
[1:23:06] the lady that had to hired it was
[1:23:09] Crystal Gayle had hired it was so long
[1:23:11] until it would just drag the ground
[1:23:13] behind her
[1:23:15] you know of course you cut it you know
[1:23:17] but
[1:23:18] she had that long hair well see they
[1:23:21] they could look at her and see that she
[1:23:22] wouldn't know
[1:23:24] you know
[1:23:27] I've always said you don't put a car out
[1:23:29] on the side of the road to try to sell
[1:23:30] it
[1:23:31] with all the dents pointing towards the
[1:23:34] highway
[1:23:37] right
[1:23:40] you put the dents on the far side where
[1:23:42] they won't be sand until they get
[1:23:43] through looking at the good side
[1:23:44] you say what do you mean by that well
[1:23:46] what I mean by that is you see women
[1:23:49] that they'll let down here
[1:23:54] and even the dress will go down here
[1:23:58] right
[1:24:00] didn't you see women that are really
[1:24:02] tied up here and everything but it comes
[1:24:05] up this way
[1:24:09] I was trying to sell automobiles
[1:24:15] I'm just trying to be straight but be a
[1:24:17] little comical where you'll think about
[1:24:20] that see if you live your life men and
[1:24:23] women
[1:24:24] in front of the people of this world
[1:24:26] they will be judged one day
[1:24:30] now especially when you come to the
[1:24:32] white throne and
[1:24:33] and God will say did you tell them
[1:24:36] about that
[1:24:38] you know did you tell them why you wore
[1:24:42] the long hire and no makeup in times did
[1:24:45] you tell them
[1:24:46] did you men tell them why you didn't
[1:24:47] look like you know peep though to the
[1:24:50] Tulips you know
[1:24:52] way back in my day
[1:24:54] you know
[1:24:56] if you don't
[1:24:57] you don't look that away
[1:25:01] you know
[1:25:03] I believe if the Lord Jesus was here
[1:25:05] brother Branson said he'd have on the
[1:25:07] suit of clothes and look like we do
[1:25:09] believe you'd know him by a robe walking
[1:25:11] down the street
[1:25:13] no
[1:25:15] he'd have them clothes they look like we
[1:25:18] look
[1:25:20] because you wouldn't be able to talk to
[1:25:21] nobody like that
[1:25:23] except the hip is done on 10th Street
[1:25:28] but get what I'm trying to say
[1:25:32] you know that judgment begins at the
[1:25:34] house of the Lord
[1:25:38] and if it begins at the house of the
[1:25:40] Lord's word is the rest of them wind up
[1:25:42] right
[1:25:45] and you know what I love the way the
[1:25:48] prophet describes it
[1:25:49] he said at judgment it will not be the
[1:25:53] old sinner that comes by you know the
[1:25:56] throne just illustrating it paraphrasing
[1:25:59] it
[1:26:00] he says they'll just bow her head and
[1:26:02] walk right on
[1:26:04] you know
[1:26:06] would it be those that are anointed of
[1:26:09] the spirit of God and and look like and
[1:26:11] dressed like and act like Christians
[1:26:13] Maybe
[1:26:14] and they'll say have not I done this or
[1:26:17] how not I done that he'll say depart
[1:26:19] from me I never knew you
[1:26:22] wouldn't that be a horrible thing
[1:26:26] I'm not throwing in no Stones I'm
[1:26:28] talking there's a lady done at maze with
[1:26:30] it she's probably at least 80 or maybe a
[1:26:34] little more
[1:26:35] and you know I've known her since I was
[1:26:37] just a kid
[1:26:40] and as far as
[1:26:41] looking at her dress she could have made
[1:26:44] one and washed it every day
[1:26:47] and put it back on
[1:26:49] because I never saw her change the style
[1:26:52] of dresses
[1:26:58] always every dress is made the same look
[1:27:01] the same you could have took a picture
[1:27:03] of her at 30. 40 50 60 70.
[1:27:08] and she'd look the same
[1:27:13] I'm not saying she's not going to make
[1:27:15] it
[1:27:17] but what if it is that that's what she
[1:27:19] bases it upon
[1:27:21] and then
[1:27:23] when she winds up at the end of the road
[1:27:26] she's spent all of her life
[1:27:29] in that way
[1:27:31] and yet she won't be in heaven
[1:27:37] saying anything that's between her and
[1:27:39] God that's not me and you and her and
[1:27:41] that's fussing it out
[1:27:44] he said well it's just what's in the
[1:27:46] heart
[1:27:47] that's what everybody says that God
[1:27:49] knows my heart I said that's a trouble
[1:27:51] if he didn't know your hearts you could
[1:27:52] get by with it
[1:27:54] because out of the heart precedeth all
[1:27:56] things
[1:28:01] but my point is what
[1:28:05] you realize one day he at least
[1:28:08] somewhere he will be glorified in the
[1:28:10] midst of the church
[1:28:14] and he will be standing not as a priest
[1:28:18] but we he will be the coming judge we
[1:28:20] just read
[1:28:21] in the whole body of believers
[1:28:25] the Saints shall judge the Earth
[1:28:28] Prophet explaining that on spoken word
[1:28:30] Original Seed Saints shall judge the
[1:28:32] Earth that's right
[1:28:33] I don't oh don't dare you go to court
[1:28:36] one another and not take it before the
[1:28:39] church right so ain't still judge the
[1:28:41] Earth where is the government going to
[1:28:43] be upon upon the shoulders his body the
[1:28:47] government upon his shoulders that's a
[1:28:49] part of the body what is it the Earthly
[1:28:51] strength God's Earthly strength is his
[1:28:55] word made flesh in his body here on
[1:28:58] Earth bringing it to pass
[1:29:03] what about it
[1:29:06] but I didn't think that they they'd have
[1:29:08] to be judged everybody's going to be
[1:29:10] judged
[1:29:13] God ain't gonna send nobody to Hell
[1:29:14] without being judged first
[1:29:18] you've got to be judged see
[1:29:20] all right
[1:29:21] it meant that when it was down here tied
[1:29:24] around the waist that he was in serving
[1:29:26] we said now it's tied over his shoulder
[1:29:30] and he walk out with a girdle tied
[1:29:33] around the top with a size over his
[1:29:36] shoulder
[1:29:37] girded about the paps the breasts with a
[1:29:41] golden girdle girded up high what is it
[1:29:45] an attorney a judge
[1:29:50] he can put it all together in
[1:29:54] in and bring it up
[1:29:56] well because he's talking about the
[1:29:57] bride of Christ
[1:30:01] but now let's don't be like a lot of
[1:30:04] people would say they uh come on
[1:30:08] let's go downtown and judge them people
[1:30:12] you're the only one that's going to get
[1:30:14] judged in that case
[1:30:16] you ain't gonna be no judge it's when
[1:30:18] you're doing things automatically as a
[1:30:21] human being not to try to impress or or
[1:30:24] try to pull
[1:30:26] you know
[1:30:27] but to try to just be yourself as a
[1:30:29] Christian
[1:30:31] and then being that you're going to
[1:30:33] judge the world's going to be judged by
[1:30:35] you
[1:30:36] is it not so with the Book of Daniel
[1:30:38] that we could go into it's not the Book
[1:30:40] of Revelations talking about the watch
[1:30:42] on judgment in the Book of Daniel 7 and
[1:30:45] 9 and 10 where it goes on into that
[1:30:48] there'll be one sitting on the throne
[1:30:52] right
[1:30:54] hair like woo we'll get into these
[1:30:56] things later
[1:30:58] but there's going to be thousands or
[1:31:00] some thousands
[1:31:02] ministering unto him
[1:31:05] the prophet said we will see it on the
[1:31:09] throne
[1:31:11] and judge the world
[1:31:16] go be a big old room
[1:31:20] right
[1:31:22] gonna be a lot of things taking place
[1:31:27] but you know I know I get carnal and I
[1:31:29] try to figure things out
[1:31:31] I try to figure out maybe how many
[1:31:32] millions of years it'd take for the
[1:31:34] white Throne to take place
[1:31:36] you know
[1:31:38] but then one day I just thought well you
[1:31:40] know what if it's us
[1:31:46] well why not put a few million over here
[1:31:48] with this group and a few million over
[1:31:50] with another group of the Bride of cry
[1:31:52] and let that little group that's our
[1:31:54] judgment you can get it over with just
[1:31:56] like that we can go on into eternity
[1:32:00] right
[1:32:01] I just think Carnival
[1:32:04] huh
[1:32:05] but she ain't tying up millions of years
[1:32:07] trying to find out being judged
[1:32:12] my point is
[1:32:15] if it's him and us
[1:32:18] you know that your judgment
[1:32:20] will be the same as his
[1:32:25] right I got in trouble trying to explain
[1:32:26] this years ago here I go again I get in
[1:32:29] trouble okie dokie
[1:32:32] what about when it comes to the Watcher
[1:32:34] on judgment
[1:32:36] you realize when your own children comes
[1:32:38] before you
[1:32:41] your own grandchildren
[1:32:43] great-grandchildren or something just
[1:32:44] using it
[1:32:46] you can't have one judgment in him have
[1:32:49] another
[1:32:52] his judgment will be straight blunt
[1:32:54] that's it did you witness
[1:32:57] you'd have to say yes I did
[1:33:01] then he would have to say
[1:33:04] your judgment is just and you'd have to
[1:33:06] say your judgment is just the person
[1:33:09] would have nothing to
[1:33:11] argue
[1:33:14] um
[1:33:17] but just what if it is
[1:33:22] that
[1:33:24] he looks back and he says
[1:33:27] but that was your children
[1:33:34] they may have went wrong
[1:33:37] but they stood up for you one day
[1:33:42] somebody said something about you one
[1:33:44] day and they stood up for you
[1:33:48] they said don't talk about my mama like
[1:33:49] that
[1:33:51] my daddy my brothers my sisters my uncle
[1:33:53] granddaddies or whatever
[1:33:55] grandmothers
[1:33:58] see the Judgment would be said
[1:34:01] because it'd be nothing to change
[1:34:03] judgment's not going to be somebody
[1:34:04] going up and arguing a case right it
[1:34:08] ain't going to be millions of years of
[1:34:10] Arc In the case
[1:34:11] where if you don't like your attorney
[1:34:12] your fire and get you another one
[1:34:15] no
[1:34:16] it's going to be instantly quick because
[1:34:19] he can bring your whole life right
[1:34:21] before you in a split second right
[1:34:24] but just what if he says
[1:34:28] that was your neighbor you remember
[1:34:31] the neighbors that lived beside her
[1:34:33] brother Branham you remember
[1:34:38] I believe it was Rebecca wasn't it that
[1:34:40] told about it
[1:34:41] said Daddy said they'll get eternal life
[1:34:45] said because they never complained about
[1:34:48] all of the times that you know the
[1:34:51] people were here and coming by in the
[1:34:53] middle of the night and do it I said
[1:34:55] they'll be given eternal life
[1:35:01] she's not all over with here on the
[1:35:03] basis of that it's all over with here on
[1:35:06] what the Judgment part is
[1:35:08] yes
[1:35:10] but remember he can change judgment to
[1:35:12] Grace
[1:35:15] and I tried to explain that years ago
[1:35:17] and his brother said are you saying that
[1:35:18] your family is going to be saved I said
[1:35:20] if God wants to again
[1:35:25] now let's back up we're on Earth
[1:35:29] all right
[1:35:31] right
[1:35:32] we ain't had to watch on judgment
[1:35:34] right okay we're on Earth okay back up
[1:35:37] with me
[1:35:39] get out of heaven and come back down
[1:35:41] here
[1:35:42] to worry that
[1:35:46] is being seen on Earth as the bride of
[1:35:48] Christ
[1:35:50] and why can't you believe for your
[1:35:52] family
[1:35:54] may I quote the prophet
[1:35:57] if you don't have enough faith for your
[1:35:59] family I'm paraphrasing it'll be close
[1:36:01] to right
[1:36:03] he said I doubt you having faith for
[1:36:06] yourself
[1:36:12] but I can't
[1:36:14] I just look how bad they've done
[1:36:17] most of it is because you're mad at them
[1:36:19] because they didn't do what you wanted
[1:36:21] them to do
[1:36:22] right
[1:36:23] come on Mamas and Daddy is
[1:36:28] you think well this one can make it God
[1:36:31] he's been a pretty good guy but that
[1:36:32] ain't no good
[1:36:34] oh you're a good mom and a daddy
[1:36:41] right yeah
[1:36:45] and I didn't talk about planning to get
[1:36:48] to the white throne in my kids and
[1:36:50] grandkids and I'll get there and then me
[1:36:52] plead the case I didn't say that I said
[1:36:55] my judgment would be the same as his
[1:36:57] judgment which would mean condemnation
[1:37:01] but he can change condemnation to Grace
[1:37:05] but why can't we believe for our
[1:37:07] children
[1:37:09] yeah but look how bad they're getting
[1:37:13] how bad did you get
[1:37:17] huh
[1:37:21] what hole did God have to have to dig
[1:37:24] you out of
[1:37:30] it you know what we're not planning to
[1:37:32] do anything
[1:37:33] wait and let God speak to you
[1:37:37] amen
[1:37:41] he told me said you'll be there with
[1:37:43] your offspring
[1:37:45] all right
[1:37:48] there's this one that was way out there
[1:37:50] a long ways
[1:37:53] well we said I got the perfect example
[1:37:55] in my two boys I got the prodigal son
[1:37:57] and and the Wayward one
[1:38:00] I mean the The Prodigal Son and the the
[1:38:03] good one Terrence has just been with us
[1:38:06] all along
[1:38:07] he just never left
[1:38:09] but here goes Wayne out he goes
[1:38:13] I ain't seeing Terence stayed too good
[1:38:15] because you remember my illustration
[1:38:19] his Halo was held up by a couple of
[1:38:21] horns up there that Wiggles because he
[1:38:24] was a kid and so is the kids and the
[1:38:27] grandkids and the great grandkids
[1:38:30] all right
[1:38:32] but it's a perfect example
[1:38:36] of one going out and you having to call
[1:38:39] for him
[1:38:40] well you see I call from everyone
[1:38:45] who called for the wives the kids
[1:38:48] the grandkids
[1:38:50] every one of them
[1:38:53] he'll be there as my offspring
[1:38:56] then I'm not going to accept that I've
[1:38:58] got to wait to get there to get them
[1:39:00] I never have taught that
[1:39:05] let him get you in a car and run you
[1:39:07] down the highway unless you run up
[1:39:08] against a tree and you get out and go
[1:39:10] walking down the side of the road and
[1:39:12] three or four people comes riding up and
[1:39:14] say where was the other guy
[1:39:16] right right
[1:39:20] if you want to sit back our grinning
[1:39:22] the people come up wondering where was
[1:39:24] the other man that was in the car
[1:39:26] because they saw a man walk all three of
[1:39:28] them
[1:39:29] get out of the car and walk home
[1:39:36] he's still working on me
[1:39:41] why can't you believe for your kids
[1:39:49] what you believe for
[1:39:52] believe it if they'd straighten up my
[1:39:54] Lord if I could believe that
[1:39:56] no problem
[1:39:58] it's when they won't straighten up got
[1:40:00] to get keep getting worse
[1:40:04] in the worse you get the more you
[1:40:06] grinning okay God you're gonna have to
[1:40:09] take care of this because I couldn't
[1:40:10] have done it a long time ago
[1:40:13] right
[1:40:16] because remember
[1:40:19] if we're going to judge
[1:40:22] we are going to have to have something
[1:40:26] to judge right
[1:40:31] is that right nice point
[1:40:34] we can talk about the size and moving it
[1:40:36] around do whatever we want where to put
[1:40:37] it what to do with it you can get all
[1:40:40] that but what about the judge
[1:40:46] I didn't ask to be this
[1:40:50] God chose me
[1:40:56] he makes us judges
[1:40:58] but you know those judges are priests
[1:41:00] and kings
[1:41:05] you know you can have a judge and then
[1:41:07] kind of override him right
[1:41:09] they just get a higher judge
[1:41:11] ain't no right to judge even them great
[1:41:14] judges of England with the white wig of
[1:41:17] superiority
[1:41:22] you realize the king can just go there
[1:41:24] and go
[1:41:29] that no more because they had to kind of
[1:41:31] honor the Kings
[1:41:34] stay in good with them you know
[1:41:36] because they could remove them
[1:41:42] but who's going to remove the king
[1:41:46] are you with me I'm not down there a lot
[1:41:49] are you with me who's going to remove
[1:41:51] the king I thought we were priests and
[1:41:54] kings
[1:41:57] who can remove us
[1:42:01] well God can now wait just a minute
[1:42:05] if he made me that right
[1:42:08] you are going to have to argue the case
[1:42:11] with him
[1:42:14] he made me the king
[1:42:18] well he took David out
[1:42:21] he didn't take David out and they dirtly
[1:42:23] died
[1:42:26] right
[1:42:29] come on
[1:42:31] look Church
[1:42:33] we want to argue about the Garment the
[1:42:36] things or putting it to our pictures of
[1:42:38] it
[1:42:39] and we miss the whole story
[1:42:42] and it's talking about us
[1:42:45] in a beautiful
[1:42:47] beautiful marvelous understanding that
[1:42:51] all of the scriptures come down into
[1:42:54] being fulfilled
[1:42:56] in the bride of Christ
[1:43:04] amen and then you wonder
[1:43:06] and then you think about well I don't
[1:43:08] know where I am in the word
[1:43:11] amen you know where we are in order
[1:43:15] I know I'm not where I want to be in the
[1:43:17] word
[1:43:18] are you
[1:43:20] what am I worried about where I am in
[1:43:21] the word
[1:43:23] if I find myself in the written word I
[1:43:26] got a good case
[1:43:28] because I can say now Lord
[1:43:30] this right here talks about somebody
[1:43:36] and may I read this to you that it means
[1:43:39] somebody that has studied all of this
[1:43:42] and accepted all of this and accepted
[1:43:44] you as their Savior and believe that all
[1:43:47] is true and then in the relies to the
[1:43:49] book it's written why can't I believe I
[1:43:51] am that person
[1:43:58] that's a problem let's stand come on
[1:44:01] foreign
[1:44:06] what does it mean to be in the body of
[1:44:08] Christ
[1:44:13] it means
[1:44:15] all of the Bible
[1:44:18] is fulfilled
[1:44:22] all the Bible will be made manifest
[1:44:27] in a little group of people
[1:44:32] on the bride
[1:44:36] how much more could I speak about what
[1:44:38] God has to say about you and I
[1:44:41] if he looked at David in the dirty
[1:44:43] manners that he was and all the things
[1:44:44] and he said a man after my own heart
[1:44:52] and he looks at a group of people that
[1:44:57] compare it to the world and we're very
[1:44:59] low
[1:45:00] I'm talking about the religious world
[1:45:02] untruthfully
[1:45:04] you know
[1:45:05] because today they're running the aisles
[1:45:08] they're screaming and hollering about
[1:45:09] God and what he's doing
[1:45:11] and
[1:45:13] we sit and give a good grin every once
[1:45:15] in a while and head shake for amen
[1:45:23] what about it what do we got boys okay
[1:45:29] Go Go Tell It on the Mountain
[1:45:32] s
[1:45:57] anybody have a knee
[1:46:04] that Jesus Christ
[1:46:23] that Jesus Christ is born God is waiting
[1:46:28] on the people
[1:46:31] to believe
[1:46:34] and
[1:46:36] everywhere
[1:46:41] but brother damn I've got so many
[1:46:44] problems I didn't ask you about your
[1:46:46] problems
[1:46:57] because he can't override your free
[1:47:00] moral agency
[1:47:03] he can't make you be saved
[1:47:09] all you gotta do
[1:47:37] other we send this word offer the need
[1:47:41] that our sister has we believe it's a
[1:47:44] finished product you take care of
[1:47:46] everything because we are here your
[1:47:48] children
[1:47:49] and your children can call out to the
[1:47:52] father and the father will come on the
[1:47:53] scene we believe you Lord in Jesus
[1:47:57] anybody else
[1:48:10] Jesus Christ is
[1:48:15] think about it
[1:48:17] two thousand years talking about Jesus
[1:48:19] Christ
[1:48:21] isn't it odd don't you think that way
[1:48:25] isn't it odd
[1:48:27] that in the end of the Bible
[1:48:31] and Through the Bible you would be
[1:48:33] trying to bring if you caught what I was
[1:48:36] talking about you're trying to bring
[1:48:37] into being a God that can be
[1:48:39] comprehended by mankind
[1:48:44] you know the whole Bible
[1:48:47] is describing that God and his ways and
[1:48:50] thought and then when you get to the end
[1:48:52] of it
[1:48:55] it
[1:48:57] starts talking about
[1:48:59] the people
[1:49:02] well then we come to find it out you
[1:49:04] know that
[1:49:07] the Bible was them people down there
[1:49:10] now quote to prophet he said the
[1:49:11] Believers in the book
[1:49:15] you know there wouldn't be no Genesis or
[1:49:17] without
[1:49:18] Moses without I mean the Abraham and the
[1:49:20] different ones that are listed in
[1:49:22] Genesis Adam and Eve
[1:49:25] you know there wouldn't be no book of
[1:49:27] Acts without the people that were the
[1:49:28] her you know that there wouldn't be an
[1:49:30] end time without people
[1:49:33] well why can't we believe Who We Are
[1:49:39] why don't we start saying Who We Are no
[1:49:42] we'll go outside and when you're going
[1:49:44] to doctor tomorrow I gotta go do this
[1:49:48] I gotta go for that sleep acne tomorrow

[1:49:59] anything else except pray for me to go
[1:50:01] and go to sleep because I can go to
[1:50:03] sleep with a drop of a hat but then when
[1:50:05] you tell me I got to go to sleep
[1:50:07] I'm like a little kid

[1:50:13] that's right I mean whatever they tell
[1:50:16] me I got I just laugh and grin and just
[1:50:19] go right on okay
[1:50:22] that's what I told him the other day he
[1:50:24] was talking about this out in the other
[1:50:26] I said I was a 74 year old supposed to
[1:50:28] feel
[1:50:31] good
[1:50:32] because he wouldn't send me forward he
[1:50:34] couldn't understand
