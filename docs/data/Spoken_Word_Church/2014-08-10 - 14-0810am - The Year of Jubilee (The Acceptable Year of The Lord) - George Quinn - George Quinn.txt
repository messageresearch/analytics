========================================

amen good morning good morning this is a great time now is to know who you believe in amen because you know the prophet said that there will come some that make cancer seem like a toothache we see this stuff ebola how it spreading and they were saying that 70 of the people that come in contact with it is dying and so you know that's a terrible thing we're going to read from 2nd thessalonians the second chapter let us pray heavenly father we are grateful lord this day that you have given unto us yes lord your sinful your word lord to guide us and direct us lord let us not turn aside from your precious word but to hold fast let us seek each day lord of greater and greater understanding love for each thing that you promise god as is being fulfilled let us be a part of it yes lord we thank you today and just bless everyone lord that's present lord we ask you to touch every heart father there be anything within the hinders in any way lord that you will remove it and bring your word forth unto us in jesus christ now we pray amen second thessalonians the second chapter now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him let no man deceive you by any means father they shall not come except there can be falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition remember ye not that when i was with you i told you these things for the mystery of iniquity it was already worked only he who now led us will let until he be taken out of the way whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the work working off satan with all power and signs and lying wonders in them and for this cause god shall send them strong delusions that they should believe alive but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and believers belief of the you by our truth to the attending of the glory of our lord jesus christ therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by worry of a pistol comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work amen god bless amen in the swing amen and amen we'll meet on that beautiful shore be wonderful amen we had a real good time friday night at the uh meeting at ruth i think they took up 116 117 000 for the missionary offerings and things so it was really really good and all and we really had a good time made schedules for the next few days so it's a schedule month for me so it's coming next weekend the 17th brother danny del mundo will be with us from the philippines and then the week following that on the 24th 20th first 20th all right brother uh samson shetty will be here on the 20th then brother danny will be on the 17th and then brother samuel perkash will be with us on the 24th so we got those schedules already made you know and everything and at this time of the year that's what we do we schedule meetings for the minister brother or not but we did we had a good time and a good fellowship together amen you're looking forward to the word brother quinn has come to be with us to speak to us and you know and tell us about the lord and the work he's doing and the things whatever he desires and this afternoon now the offering this afternoon will be given to brother quinn to take as we always do that he can take it and do whatever he desires with it he does not use any church money that the people giving from churches for his own expenses all right but what you give him will always go to some other work some doing food to buy rent houses to be or whatever you know churches to do and we certainly do appreciate them so remember this afternoon you got anything special put it in the offering because all the offering will go to brother quinn all right so let's just sing open the eyes of my heart as brother george quinn comes to bring the word of the lord unto us all right open the eyes of my heart open that god sent us right yes i want to see pour out your power shining is the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy amen holy holy you are holy holy holy yes your holy amen amen god bless you this morning praise the lord certainly a joy to be in your midst again it's always a very short time that you pass by but it is a moment that we treasure we really mean that uh we treasure these moments praise the lord uh very very much in our heart and we're so appreciative of you this morning praise the lord and for all that you stand for and for all that you do for this wonderful work of god amen so we're glad to be here and if you would just be seated please because uh this is the time uh yeah times times something else isn't it amen yes and uh praise the lord but uh we are creatures of time and we have to watch time and i always try to balance what i can do in the time that i've got and i certainly do appreciate your prayers and your giving we went over to uh india last year had a wonderful time there and uh truly you know it makes me feel good i preached in a church but 400 people in it and tonight wonderful group of people wonderful group of people and one of the uh one of the elders at the church the assistant's pastor he said um he said we really appreciate your ministry and we need your ministry and that's a nice thing to think that at least you've got a little bit to play amen and it's like you're here you might have many or whatever not but you still got to put to play they've got a part to play amen like your nails got a part to play amen if you didn't have any nails you'd find picking up wouldn't be easy so anyway i'm glad to be a part of that and you know missionary work i've never recalled my i call myself a pastor just visiting other countries a missionary no a missionary apostle brother samuel that's going to plant churches and we've helped to do that but um i'd never call myself a real tree missionary like that but anyway uh what i can say is that it's a joy to be a blessing to the bride of jesus christ that's many many years ago i made that decision that i was going to serve his bride amen and like lenion says just to sing a song for the bride well i've had a ministry to the bride and i'm glad uh for that and uh it works out in so many different ways that you'd never think because last year in india one of the little pastors uh his wife i the indians are they've got their culture they've got their way of going you know and just like with the irish half the american have and so uh she was talking to me and i knew she was trying to get to a point amen and the point was could i get her a bible that had big letters because her eyes said was that was her point you know so we got there we got there sisters nice to see you again god bless you you know and um uh she said could could you buy me a bible like that with big letters and i said sister i certainly could amen i certainly could and we did and then she started on again a little bit so i'm listening to her and i said go ahead sister just spit it out as it were and she says could you get new specs for me as well and that to me that's that's missionary work you you if you bless nobody else there at least you blessed her amen see and that's that's it and of course uh you're always using the monies that have come in amen to you and uh as this brother uh samuel said to you there you know we still buy the race for the poorer peoples uh they're not all poor believe me if you've got a good job and in a city in india you're probably better off than you are so don't be thinking this all they're all begging bulls you know i'm telling you they all got their washing machines and going to their big restaurants and all today believe me so anyway but in the villages they don't have that and then this year we were over in thailand to see the good people there and they're kind of poor you know and one of the reasons the pastors always said to me about how pure they are why is it is and i to tell you the truth i just said to him you know oh it's your tithing you know uh you just just don't teach the people enough tithing i remember brother samuel said to me one time that you know he said if you don't pay your tithes he said just pay them for a year and if god doesn't bless you he said i'll give you back every time you paid if god has to he's obligated to do it he is obligated to do it and that's that's why they say why i was so poor because they're so tight they don't want to give anything to god and he can't give a nan hang back amen so uh you know uh but it was a wonderful time a wonderful time there and just to share with the uh just to serve with the saints there and every time i go over there's a couple of people baptized there in thailand so we're thankful and they're getting more translated books and whatnot and we're thankful for these things and at all costs and it's good to help the cause that's what we're in here for that help the cause as best we can we went on over to the philippines and uh i'm well used to uh well used to getting up during the night amen it's one of those things that come with the work you know you're getting on buses at one o'clock in the morning and flights at half past 12 a.m and but i'm used to that night amen so uh praise the lord uh well over two million miles covered for the lord jesus now and i think that's wonderful and i'm glad it was all for him amen and uh so we went into the philippines and it was delightful to meet the brothers and uh you know uh all them little pastors brother samuel we've always tried to give them uh even if it's 75 each if there's 12 of them there or a couple extra postures you know give them a little bit extra or whatever not at all it all amounts to something and if you didn't have it you wouldn't be able to give it but they're happy they've come down and they're happy to get something to know that they're loved and you know it's not going to make them but it'll help them and and then of course the young brother that with the church really i don't want to get involved in building churches because amen uh yeah but funnily enough i've always got involved you know yeah i said i didn't want to get involved you know and this year was the same uh brother don don from uh a way over there in uh dingle land it's called just uh in lucon right on the pacific coast lovely place but very open to typhoons and high winds and his little church we went in that night with a lovely meal before we went in but the little church itself was just almost ready to fall down on top of them and you know i looked at it and i took a few photographs and he said we've got land and we would love to build another church and i said well i'll help you to do it i didn't say i would do it i said i'll help you to do it and uh you know that's that's ongoing now i i put i put about a third of the price and and uh somewhere in there i would help with a few others and we're hoping that the rest even from the camp meetings well we'll get up or wherever it comes from we'll get up to uh to get that little church now there's many needs about that but in the different places in philippines but this is one where i was there and and so that's why i and he's a lovely lad his wife had a new baby and uh and right now he's in the mountains they walk over the mountains no trails nothing over the little rivers they walk and walk they got the rucksacks until they get to the villages where they're way up in the mountains nobody knows anything about them and there they bring this message to the people so you got to applaud that amen and that's that's where he is that's where he is right now amen so i think it's a worthy cause there amen praise the lord indonesia uh it's 200 million muslims but very quickly because i want to move on fast but um in indonesia there's 200 million muslims but they're like america how many people are at church today in america let's say for a figure i don't know brother we'd say six million okay well what about the other 295 or six million where are they today you know and see so that's the way it is that's the way it is over there they belong to the muslim denomination and maybe they'll go at ramadan or something like that but the rest of the year they just live like like any denomination so i'm glad about that because if that wasn't the case probably the bride would be more persecuted but you can get the little places where they are there and they're not being persecuted and i'm glad for that praise the lord i'm glad for that and while we were there uh there's two churches and the brother that we go with uh uh say pray young uh he's a lovely brother and a lovely group of people uh just the last day before i came back to bangkok i i got a little tommy upset you know i was drinking some uh what a cucumber juice and ice i don't know if you've ever drunk that before but i never had you know but that night i just felt a little bit and they were having a prayer service and i i said look just give me a mess here tonight because uh i'm flannel tomorrow i want to rest up and be up so all the young people came over to the pastor's house after the service to see me and say goodbye and it was packed believe me it was packed with young people and uh it was lovely that they've got that love for you and uh we really really love them and so uh there that church is doing well it's growing and then we flew down to uh pick em baro baru it's called and brother danny will tell you about these places too and just outside there about 100 kilometers a little place where i couldn't even take you to today ever had to but that's the way it's been with god you know all my life i've been to places where i couldn't even take you back to amen but it's the people we've reached the people we've got right in there with the people and we had a wonderful time there a few people had come in and uh we had wonderful services and we bought tasty at people and i was looking at the big river i said well it's a big enough tank amen so so don't have to worry about that and i was telling brother samuel about the young girl 14 she wanted to be baptized she just wanted to be baptized and her parents thought she's too young but she she wanted to be baptized so she asked the pastor they asked the pastor and he said if you really want to you may and i'll tell you what she was happy when she was baptized so i was wonderful and and the girl with the little baby she had phoned up to be baptized today and she didn't even know it was on she phoned away from some place and she traveled up and was baptized as well and she was saying that her husband doesn't follow the doesn't come to church and i said here well next year i'll come back and baptize him too amen that's you have to be positive hallelujah and that's what i want to do amen and pray for him and praise the lord you pray for me so it was a wonderful time there and some people rededicated their marriages i i didn't even bring that up but they wanted their marriages rededicated in the name of the lord jesus christ and we were able to do that and that's it so folks as i say very uh whatever way you want to put it i couldn't save you sell you a chev chevrolet car couldn't sell you forward i wouldn't know how to do it amen i made i might end up losing money if i was a salesman you know but my business and your pastor's business and the minister's business is the work of the lord jesus christ hallelujah that that we know about amen and that's where we move in that circle so praise the lord it doesn't matter you know you meet someone and you say i can help you i can help you and that's it so i do thank you for your prayers i'll be going back to india god willing they're already looking forward to us coming but as i say i'd like to get home and get one tour out of the way before i'm starting to plan another one you know post not yourself of tomorrow and you don't know what a day's going to bring forth and just to say that my son and he has had kidney stones he's been in hospital twice but the second time he went in there they couldn't reach it because of his pelvic bone so he's uh due for a procedure on tuesday morning here this tuesday coming and i'd appreciate you remembering them we asked it at the camp meeting but uh the more prayer i mean you know paul paul talked about the church and and he said um he said and i thank you for your prayers for me amen paul needed prayer we all need prayer for one another pray for one another the scripture says so i trust you remember them because whatever way they're going to go up into his kidney and get this thing out they can't blast it but they can do it brother weird but you don't want you don't want the surgeon to slip you know and we're not we we believe god's a healer and we believe i want god's hands to be on that man amen when he's going in there and and and i know it'll it'll be sore you'd expect that but as long as they're out and gone and everything is working well then we'll be happy and i appreciate your prayers for it and i certainly will let your pastor know just exactly how that how that goes when i get home amen so the lord bless you amen this morning and we're just going to get right into the word of god amen praise the lord and it isn't leviticus is what i want to read this morning praise the lord and i'll not be able to cover every every last aspect of this chapter i'll be here to two o'clock or maybe even beyond that but we what we can't cover we will cover this morning and it says and the lord speak unto moses this is chapter 25 of leviticus verse one and and you know notice it wasn't that moses spoke unto the lord it was the lord spoke unto moses and he said this is what you do so he says speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come into the land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord that is thus saith the lord amen now and and for six years thou shalt sow this i failed and six years i shall prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for the lord that uh though uh shalt thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard that which growth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap neither gather the grips of thy vain unrest for it is a year of rest unto the land and the sabbath of the lord shall be meet for you for thee and for uh thy servant and for the thy maid and for thy hard servant and for thy stranger that so journaleth with thee and for thy catalan for the beast that are in the land shall all the increase thereof be meat and thousand number seven sabbaths of years unto these seven times uh seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be on to the forty and nine years then shall i cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sign on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sign throughout all your land and ye shall hallow the 50th year hallow ye shall make it holy hallelujah and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family a jubilee shall be that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which growth of itself in it nor gather the grapes of it of thy vine unrest for it is a jubilee it shall be holy unto you you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field in the year of jubilee ye shall return every man to his possession and may the lord add his blessing and we can remain standing and heavenly father lord this is your word lord in the book of peter we are told that these holy man were moved by the holy spirit to write what we've got right in front of us this morning we believe this is this is your holy word today lord and we pray that you will bless it lord that you will get me out of the way and dear god i pray you'll use my lips and my thoughts lord and god bless the people this morning hallelujah we ask lord jesus either your people amen and lord you have this table fed feed us this morning on this lord's day and we ask it in jesus christ holy name amen praise the lord praise the lord you may be seated at night and god bless you uh amen i'll watch i'll try to watch my my time now uh and certainly in this afternoon i'll come at a different angle but this is just to me this is just a sunday morning meeting amen praise the lord i don't promise to preach into the rapture i wish i could amen because i have a good word brother dick hey man if i could do it this morning we'd be raptured this afternoon you know but we just got our portion amen i know brother samuel has been teaching these things and we talked about it last night and even he said something last night that i'll not even be able to cover today it's a very very full chapter but it is a wonderful chapter amen and hard i came to think about it brother weed was very simple uh i was thinking about the acceptable year of the lord the acceptable year of the lord amen and you know maybe there's some people here today if you say they accept that what would that actually mean well that is the year of jubilee that's what the acceptable year of the lord is and that's exactly what the lord jesus came to proclaim liberty throughout the land a year of jubilee the gospel had come hallelujah and all the types and shadows don't matter nothing anymore amen we've got the reality of the promise in the lord jesus christ amen so um really in in this chapter and i want to tell you some nice things here but notice that it starts off with the law of the land that's the general title uh the law of the land and it is the sabbatic year of rest amen that they were told every seven years rest the land now all i can say and i was looking at our little i know the brothers were over and uh uh israel a good few years ago now brother samuel but amen all i can say is thank god for israel today hallelujah they are playing their part as we are playing our part uh we are then the ruth she is the naomi hallelujah and she's right there in the land where she ought to be and even during the conflict there that you've been reading about or whatever not listening on the radio amen that at the height of it there was 900 jews returned to jerusalem not one week even at the fighting going on hard they're in gaza so they weren't going to turn away and run away and say oh we're not going there it's too rough they were there why were they there amen and so if i may say this i had the honor to talk to a soldier on the phone who had been hurt in gaza amen his name is jeremy he's training to be a rabbi but i'll tell you what he's got a good lot of revelation about him amen not as deep as ours of course not but there he was with his platoon down there in gaza amen standing up for what anybody would have done hallelujah don't you men tell me that when the british were coming amen and that that fella that was riding on his horse and the british are coming don't you tell me you wouldn't run to get your uh minute man you would have been there hallelujah you've been saying well no no no we're we don't want that anymore we're standing hey we'll die here hallelujah fighting or we will see liberty in this land amen so praise god they're the same over there and i said to him i said germany may i say to you i am that you weren't killed in gaza and we do feel sorry for the children all killed amen we knew that but like it's like the ambassador said to the u.n if you do not fire one more rocket we'll not fire anything back on you i mean folks we know that and i'm not not going to go into that but it was wonderful just to talk to him amen and praise the lord to realize that we are just in a few days uh earlier this year maybe two months ago uh my i bought a tree two trees one for my wife and one for myself and uh they are planted now they're planted in the land of israel amen now within a few short days israel has gone into this sabbatic year it's called the shemitah year and i'm not very good at hebrew pronunciation it's called the shemitah year and from uh just about uh coming into september right about this time uh might even be in the uh late august but i'm not sure exact date but that year starts and they ain't going to plant nothing for a whole year amen and and and and when you get into this year hallelujah uh the submitter year you know when you look at the captivity uh of israel and babylon and you know it's wonderful that that god actually tells you why he led them into captivity now we know we can say well if you're asking the children they turned away from the lord they wouldn't keep his commandments they were worshiping the sun god and and pale and all what's the woman were crying for thomas that nimrod you know all this thing but really you go into second second chronicles 36 19 and and it says i i don't know if the brother can put that up there the house of the lord is born the wall of jerusalem broken down the people in captivity and it is to fulfill the word of the lord that was spoken jeremiah until the land enjoyed her sabbaths for as long as she laid desolate she kept sabbath to fulfill three score and ten so it was all to do with the land so god says they're not going to keep the sabbath so i'll make them keep it hallelujah i'll they'll be in captivity and that lawn will rest for 70 years amen and then he'll return unto them again praise the lord 70 years 10 sabbath rests amen and jewish tradition is always taught that to go into exile is a penalty for idolatry absolutely uh you know idolatry that's why they went into captivity amen that was the penalty of it before god that's they've always kept that tradition amen and uh and for neglecting to keep the laws of the shemitah year well this year that nation what other nation in heaven under this earth today it's going to keep that and you know the the i'll get into it later on because i've got to hit it because it's in the scripture here uh but i i i you know they're actually a lot of the farmers are worried you know modern worry well how are we going to do it what how are we going to make it but you know in this chapter 25 if you care to go home and read it yourself you'll see how they're going to make it hallelujah and i was able to tell the people we brought the fruit trees off they were voicing their concerns but i answered them back and said i'll tell you how you're going to make it god is going to bless you because you have honored his word hallelujah and you cannot honor god's word without god blessing you that's a fact of life hallelujah so that's a truth amen so that's how god's going to do it but it's right in here in this chapter amen and this this shemeta year amen uh praise the lord uh in 2001 there was was that shemeta year amen where we had the twin towers there's always something happens during these years at 2008 the economic collapse that that really nearly bankrupt ireland we were nearly bankrupt people amen now you know what bankruptcy means it means that you wake up the next day the banks are closed you don't get your pensions through the the police force aren't being paid or the the civil servants uh the public's uh purse is closed and i'll tell you you were in a bad pickle when you're there and we came very close to it but thank god uh we we missed that but it was in that year and of course i'm not going to preach on the blood moons or anything this morning but listen praise the lord we are entering into this year of rest so you know when you get into september the jews are resting their land from september to september amen and praise the lord in this in this time limit on the 13th of september amen praise the lord you're going to find that there's going to be the feast of trumpets the face of trumpets uh that's when the year starts the year of rest then the face of trumpets now what's the feast of trumpets to do simply because i want to keep it simple is to in gather israel amen the calling of the jews that 900 hallelujah coming over because they've been called hallelujah something has called them amen and they're coming together for that and and that'll go right in uh to the year 2015 and in the year 2015 the first event is going to be an eclipse of the sun the sun is going to be darkened amen that's the first thing i think it's in the third month and so you look out for these events the sun is going to be dark and then when you get in to uh when you get into the month of april hallelujah you are going to see your blood moon again amen hallelujah uh the moon will turn to blood and then after that amen you'll find that um it will go right over to the feast of tabernacles and it's just a wonderful what what we're saying is for all these events to happen in a shemitah year very very rare and and you know uh brother samuel knows we're not trying to teach new doctrine or nothing like that we're just trying to tell you that our redemption is drawn nigh hallelujah that i'll tell you we we we can all talk about the economy and we can all talk about what the devil we're losing our rights left right and center you can't say god bless you hardly to someone outside and they want to see you can't say that you know i mean you know it's not that bad isn't it you know but but we see all these things but also we see our promise this morning and that is wonderful praise the lord so you just be aware of these things you know and brother branham said in the message shalom he said it's the sins of the world getting between the sun and the moon that's causing it to go red so there you are the sins of the world have piled up amen before god amen they surely have that you know and then after the passover it will all end up in the feast of tabernacles amen which was where they built the little booths that they had remember that they come out of egypt but praise the lord with the promise that they come out to go back into the promised land amen into the millennial reign of jesus christ so that is wonderful and i did give the uh brothers uh some scriptures as we're looking at that seven year rest because it's right here in the chapter uh amen i couldn't resist looking at that and in exodus 21 you'll read about what happens in that that seven year span that if a a a man would buy a hebrew servant six years amen he would serve him but the seventh he could go out free so that was a wonderful thing and if you're a servant over there you know you can go out free next year if you know you're if you know the bible you can go next year amen and notice i don't want to go into every last little issue of that because i want to get on but uh you know if he did not want to leave his master you see he could be brought in there and the all would mark his ear and he would serve him forever so brother branham puts that like like that you know there's so many people today they don't want to leave their master maybe their baptist master or their pentecostal master they're happy with well the bible might say that but we we teach you know well i'll tell you what let the year be an old hallelujah and let them be there for that's the way they'll they'll be uh amen they'll they'll meet the lord amen so but that that tells you about that as well noy the year of jubilee the seven asabus here the 49 years and you know i know you've been through it so i just hope to keep it keep it where we're all on the i see my hymn as they say the 49 years are seven church ages and type amen the the message this morning the acceptable year bringing you right in to uh to the 50th year of the year of jubilee amen now this is very important you see this is the things i want you to get amen and and when it happened you see the trumpet of the the jubilee uh the the the blue the old i've got a a video of it somewhere where you see the old rabbi blowing the the what is it there the the boil or whatever you call it the horn amen and when you hear a big blast you know well on the day of atonement hallelujah when he blasts that amen one day he will blast it praise god and it will be on the the tenth day of the seventh month of their year and when that happens folks i tell you they are coming to their day of atonement amen they are coming to the day of atonement that's more real to me this morning than you sitting in your chair hallelujah it's not going to stop it's not going to stop and so here they are and uh praise the lord you know it will be a hallowed year a holy year amen to them and you know in bible numerology i just want to home in another little bit the the seventh day the tenth day of the seventh month what would that mean amen and uh well in the old testament brother branham says he talks about the the the numerology and you know uh the threes you know and the perfection there and uh the water and the blood and the spirit and you could go on father son holy ghost and the sevens and twelves and forties temptations and fiftieth jubilee the pentecostal jubilee of release and we know that amen and so uh he says that uh his numerals of god is perfected or is in perfection so when god speaks it and i'm glad hallelujah brother richard i might never understand every little uh dot and come of it all but i'll tell you what i know when god speaks it that will come to pass that will come to pass no matter if i've got every daughter come or not amen and so when you look at the the numerals you know let me just take you up to 10 fma number one numeral a god that's god the beginning hallelujah the source the first the unity hallelujah not three gods but one god amen one as the first hallelujah and he is certainly the first amen to his witness as we know uh the two witnesses moses and elijah a nerd of the mouth of two or three witnesses you see so two is testimony he sent them out two by two and they had a testimony praise god and certainly god has not stopped hallelujah i i had a woman she was testifying of of what had happened to her and i was looking at that woman i couldn't understand the word she was saying she was speaking in indonesia but i could see the character on her face hallelujah and i'll tell you i said i know that god touched that woman as she was testifying about her she had been healed amen and then a three as we said perfection amen and then right on during the earth the creation the four seasons of the wind uh are all yeah the and and the four corners of the earth the four cherubims it's all to do with uh with the earth there amen uh the four four number five we know is grace we have five wise virgins we've got the five ministries is right uh to perfect the saints sister peggy that's exactly right and then amen six is the number of man and that's the day that uh he had finished and he rested on the sabbath and the beast and the satanic 666 and you know you could go deeper into it i've studied it my people love it but i haven't done it for a year or two they love the numerals when you've got a sunday morning to take them into 13 or whatever number it is and i'll tell you what there's not a saint in the bible that comes under 13. but i'll tell you nimrod does judas does amen the antichrist does oh 13 amen and so it's wonderful to know that even in the numerals god has set it forth amen i suppose you could run too far with things but just as god says it that's the place to leave it amen and and then of course seven is completeness amen and it was to be in the seventh month so it was going to be complete just like our church ages i don't think if i said to anybody oh i can't wait to get into the church if church is you don't be saying where's he coming from amen because we know there's not going to be a church ages hallelujah we know that so we're just rejoicing that seven is complete amen and we're in the last one hallelujah and he called it amen for the the the age of the bride as well as the age of ludicia and i'm glad hallelujah because i don't want that luducian spirit on me amen i want the spirit of god on me i believe we can live in uh there's a kind of glory every day hallelujah and that's where i live people that's where i want to live amen every day in the presence of god amen no matter what am i who i made in the world or anything else that's how i want to live and that's how you ought to want to live as well praise the lord let your life speak more than your words amen so seven is complete amen he rested on the seventh day and it's mentioned over 600 times in your bible the seventh amen and so remember that it was in the seventh month amen then if you go on in numerology it's just very quickly here uh you find that it is new beginnings amen when you come seven plus one is it and so that's the lord brought in a new beginning hallelujah with the resurrection amen and it is the number of resurrection and seven and and noah one makes eight people a new beginning hallelujah a new heaven and a new earth coming on the eighth day amen not the seventh day and uh but on either is that right amen praise the lord and of course the value of the name of jesus is idiot amen so that's completeness isn't it new completeness there and then nine is uh completeness fullness of of um of the gifts uh there's nine gifts of the spirit amen and uh fullness thereof god couldn't give you any more than that and i just want to say this that i would not like to go to the mission field without knowing that i've got every gift every tool that i've got in my locker amen because i know i'm going to meet the devil somewhere hallelujah and i've met him praise the lord and he's a rough customer but you know something hallelujah when you've got the word and you know where you're standing you can tell him to back off and he backs off amen he really does so uh that's never funded any different than that and i can also say to you this morning that i've never seen god filling me amen even i was telling one of the brothers this morning brother aaron i believe it was you know when i come back from the the tour brother samuel uh this year uh going through them countries and um you know i come back and i said well lord uh the kitties almost empty you know but you know something i wasn't even back hardly five minutes and the kitty started to fill up again amen and i didn't do it i wasn't crying or pleading or nothing it's just that started off with my sister i went up to her house and you know and and just as i was leaving she says i want you to have that and i said but you don't you know it's okay she didn't know she said i want you put that to the work of the lord you know and i said okay you know and and that was it started hallelujah and then we went over to scotland and they'd look up took up a missionary offer you know i could fly anywhere in the world right now if the lord led me to sister i'll tell you tomorrow i could do it you know so my eyes aren't on that but i tell you my eyes are on the god that provides hallelujah the jehovah jarrah that's where my eyes are and it's wonderful we don't have to worry about it or struggle with it whatever god wants and i mean it i am very very serious that a brother samuel said brother george you know we can't take it up the day whatever reasons you know i just say amen and i'm telling you i would mean it amen i would mean it because our eyes aren't on anything but our eyes are on the lord and whatever way he does it and we're just so thankful okay so that's the the fruit of the gifts of the spirit the fruit of the spirit nine uh nine months as you know when the fruit is the fruit of the womb then you get the ten the reason i'm telling you this is because it was on there uh the seventh month and it was on the tenth day and ten in the bible is law an order it's government it's restoration amen that's why you've got ten commandments and not eleven of them if you want you can add that one if you you want but you know what i mean moses was giving them ten and daniel had the ten toes we know that and the the toes themselves the the the the main ones was christian eisenhower he said praise the lord and uh i nearly said something there but i'm not sad about at least when you're driving down the highways it says eisenhower whatever you know the little thing uh commemorating that that's what he did if he left you nothing else he left your highways and thank god for that that's all i can say thank god for for like amen that if he i'm sure he left other things he was a good president i know that when he was dying that they called up broly graham amen and obviously he was concerned about his soul amen i don't know but about the president incumbent if he'll be concerned about his soul or not but that's his business amen it's not mine but i know that i clear off that hallelujah it's nice to leave something right it's nice to leave something amen praise the lord no and uh there's so many things but amen so that's what it is and uh even in the temple of solomon you had 10 lampstands amen 10 lamb stands the law the order and you'll find that in there in the temple amen and the government and restoration so that's what 10 means amen so it was going to be completeness but there was going to be law and order about this day hallelujah amen and i'm going to stop the numerology there but that's why i did it to show you that the 7 and 10 the seventh month the 10th day and you'll remember it completeness is the is the seventh day and the tenth month is law and order and and government and restoration and that's what's going to happen to israel when they come to their day of atonement hallelujah no okay let's go on a little bit and i'll watch up there i got such a lot here that's my problem that's always my problem my brother canada you know when i get started into it it's so so rich you know i get so many blessings studying the word of god for for the church services and sure samuel and we do the same and other brothers that preach here amen so amen god runs his message his message is like that amen and he says he proclaimed the proclamation of liberty throughout the land this is what this was all about a jubilee on to you the release are going up the freedom you are free to go back to your inheritance amen you know as i said earlier it must have been wonderful when they rang the liberty bell now you might not heard that personally but you knew what was wrong the word would have spread right over hey they've rung the liberty bell and and philadelphia hallelujah and that's where we're standing now we're going to stand for our liberty hallelujah our freedom and you want it hallelujah you want it amen and you know uh president lincoln said that the nation could receive a new birth of freedom well how much more the children of god amen to enter into the acceptable year of the lord hallelujah for he who the son sets free is free indeed amen so it's wonderful now i just very quickly because there's some things brother branham said about it but amen and and i i i'll say this if i may that most of my messages are you just have to type in what i say and you'll get up on your computer you'll get up where it's coming from so you'll see that amen and then i know i can't be wrong when i'm quoting it the prophet said because we believe what he said is the truth now so the law of the land if you read that in chapter 17 from verse 14 to 17 the law of the land it's all about the law of the land and there was no oppression by commercial dealings they said fear god reverence him for he says i am the lord your god so that means we should be honest people hallelujah praise god what a thing to be honest amen and god blesses honesty amen no shitty dealings no nothing like that and uh amen and verse 18 to 19 the obedience brings safety the land will be prosperous and verse 20 to 24 they're saying well what shall we eat in this amount of year what are we going to eat you see what how are we going to do it and verse 21 is what i quoted back to to israel amen the divine promise of multiple blessings of the sixth year to suffice until the third year after when they start to grow again after the shimada year and then hallelujah they will see amen so in the eighth year and reaping the ninth year and it will bring what god says and i believe with all my heart that god will bless the land of israel that are obeying this word hallelujah amen and today and of course we obey as well back home has been farmers amen but you know something we obey spiritually as well praise the lord and have rest in our souls amen then in the law of the land you can read it on down at chapter 25 verse 25 if a poor brother is soul away of his inheritance a brother can redeem him okay i'll say more about that later if a man can redeem himself or not the year of jubilee he shall return to his inheritance and i'm glad we have a christ as our inheritance today the inheritance of of of the bride amen and that's the one we long to see praise the lord and we shall return to our inheritance we have uh you know when you go into a a card park at a hospital if you notice it says uh uh maybe a doctor it gives you his name and it says on the the floor reserved for dr so-and-so it's reserved for him that's his slot you do not go into his slot hallelujah and i'll tell you what we've got a an inheritance reserve for us in heaven hallelujah it's yours it's not mine it's yours and praise god i've got mine as well hallelujah i've got mine amen and that's what we're looking for amen then i will touch some of these things later the wall city if you can redeem it one year he may if he cannot redeem it it shall remain in the new owner's hands now that's brother branham goes as a quote on that which i hope to get through before we finish amen the villages are not included in the above the jubilee covers them once this once the horn blows they can say i'm free hallelujah i don't care i'm i'm out of here amen and nobody can stop them i hope you're i hope you're catching something i know brother gary is good amen and you know something you're catching it hallelujah when the horn goes amen when the sign that trump will sign and the dead and christ shall rise hallelujah we can throw it down hallelujah we can say to the devil we are out of here hallelujah we are free i'm going to man hurdles and you and all the devils in hell will not stop me that's exactly what we're talking about this morning praise god amen so but the the villages the wall city i'll tell you about them later about the villages won't include it they if they heard it they could walk right out amen the poor of the land he needed someone to help them out always the poor do amen and uh i've always seen scriptures that have blessed my soul and the lord brings them to me brother joe you know when it's talking about a helping the brother the poor brother and the lord says you land unto him and you give on to him and give you're given to me and and he said i will i will bless you for that amen and he never fails praise god you don't feel it's it's so much better to give than to receive folks so much better hallelujah the feeling is so much better to give than to receive and and this last while back at our church we've had visitors the whole started with four sisters coming from uh uh from from florida and it was wonderful to have them they sang in our church and they were on vacation and we had them up for uh the house meal a sister june and it was wonderful and every time the sister that we baptized a few weeks ago she had our family and we had them for lunch and there's always people coming to our home hallelujah and do you say well that must be a hardship it's no hardship hallelujah we enjoy doing it my wife wants to cook for them i don't mind paying the the meal costs hallelujah it's a joy to do it amen hallelujah for the lord amen nine the redemption of that poor brother he he considers the poor the poor and spirit amen and uh praise the lord uh he talks about the kinsman coming along uh and i'm just running us through to get to get it out of the way really amen the kinsman an uncle or a son amen uh but he had to be a relation and you know don't you know that our lord jesus became flesh amen the logos that the word of god became flesh like you and me hallelujah where brother branham said he could have a headache amen he could have a headache and yet of all he would be be praying for someone and they would be healed supernaturally healed but he would there himself have a headache amen and you can imagine how it was with brother brown at times hardly able to stand you know i i remember the first time i ever went to tucson haven't been there for maybe 25 years but the first time i went and and i didn't even know who gene norman was i just didn't know and but i was invited already invited us out for supper to his home and and that was the first time i ever seen the the the tapes that they had made of brother branham or another little camera and i've seen it and you see brother branham coming out of the and and someone brought him please pray for him and he can hardly stand yet of all he reaches over and he's praying for him with all his heart hallelujah and that's a wonderful thing and the lord did that for us amen praise god he tired himself out for us he went right down to the lowest hell amen that we could reach the highest heaven amen that's what he did folks hallelujah and it's wonderful amen and the price of redemption he paid hallelujah the the goal it's called g-o-e-l the goyle amen the price of redemption to be free by pain and the one who pays and it's all down to him hallelujah amen yes yes it surely is amen so this jubilee was declared on the day of atonement and this is why uh on the day of atonement you'll get it uh and and there's one thing this morning i i will just say to you don't get the day of atonement mixed up with a passover it's easy to do that but you know don't the passover lamb was on the what is the 14th day whatever the first month okay the passover lamb hallelujah we know that the bible says christ our passover is sacrificed for us calvary is is history hallelujah it actually happened amen and maybe i'll talk a little bit about something actually happening later on today amen uh but but this morning i'd i'd like to just come through this here what i'm doing and so amen that's that's the lamb the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world that actually was slain 2 000 years ago literally on golgotha's hell amen but the day of atonement amen and you can you just pick it out here then the holiest of holies where the high priest went in once a year and no one dared to follow him amen and who has followed christ into heaven for us who's done that nobody is able to do it amen and he's there amen in that place for us today amen now if you've got it i don't know if the brothers can show it up here or not but leviticus 16 you can read it about the day of atonement where they took the two kids of the goats and amen and you know that the priest took a lot and one of them goats was killed and the blood was sprinkled on the other goat and the priest took him outside the camp and let him free hallelujah now because there's there you can read it all down there and you you can see it it's right there amen and uh praise the lord it says and he shall make atonement verse 16 there for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the children of israel because of their transgressions and all their sins now the glorious thing is that on the day of atonement amen uh you know it applies to you and i amen but the lovely thing about it we can see the spiritual connection okay and i'll talk about it in a moment but for israel you see that it'll be for their transgressions and you know that's the day when they're going to cry out where did you receive these wounds hallelujah that's the day it'll be their day of atonement hallelujah praise god when he will appear himself amen on that day and that's going to be a wonderful day for israel the prophets will have come maybe speak about if i can fit it in but it don't matter amen and they'll bring this message hallelujah hallelujah to them people amen it's not going to be another message they they'll see it all then their eyes will be open and they'll see it hallelujah and they'll be ready amen uh for that day nine and you notice there with a little uh goat there the blood was to be sprinkled on the mercy seat amen that's where it had to be thank god for a mercy seat hallelujah we're not on a judgment seat today people we're on a mercy seat and i'll tell you mercy re-root my life i'm glad hallelujah i know where i stand when i was over with brother richard i i told him that when brother nestor was over a preaching in ireland just the same as i'm preaching with you now this morning and brother where this is true hallelujah don't make things up not behind a holy table i'll face god for this what i'm going to say to you right now but you know something when he was preaching there i i almost just slipped because you know the dimensions are so close the edges are so close and so fine and brother deck i did as he was preaching i just slipped hallelujah where i felt something was different hallelujah and i'm looking up you know you could criticize me this morning for so many reasons you if you want to you get your people right and start christmas you can do it hallelujah you know what i mean but the fact is there i'm looking up at brother and esther and and i there's i can't find nothing wrong with him hallelujah he's a brother i love him hallelujah i feel the love of god for him amen and not even a critical thing about it and i'm standing there feeling like this praise the lord i wish i could i could read it all right to you but tame would not allow me to do that that because i wrote it down amen about recognizing the presence of god hallelujah a lot of people don't recognize it but when you can recognize it hallelujah know you're in his presence and that's what it was where we just slipped there and it was wonderful and you know i felt this love for the people and and and and also i felt no condemnation no condemnation it was just beautiful i felt ageless brother i did i felt ageless i didn't feel a creature of time as brother branham talks about that you know i'm not saying i was over there because i didn't see anybody uh to talk of but myself i was changed i was there just like that that's how i felt amen and and it was wonderful and and the peace that was there it was just hard to describe i can't tell you how long i was in it it could have been moments or a minute or whatever but you know it was real to me hallelujah and you know something just seemed to say to me at the end of it all that's how it's going to be in the millennium wow you'll feel ageless you'll feel no condemnation you shouldn't even feel it today hallelujah you know there's nothing to condemn you hallelujah the god you're accepted in the beloved amen it's all gone it's all washed away he's dealt with our sins amen when they were nailed to the tree he has dealt with our sins and it's a wonderful place to be a wonderful place to be hallelujah so i i i do feel sorry for people maybe some people even going to watch us that believe they're going through the tribulation now if they believe that hard enough that's where they'll go but i'll tell you what that's right if you believe it hard enough amen and you're convinced well that's exactly where you'll go and when you get there you'll say amen we were right but amen but i'll tell you what we'll be in the glory we'll be in the glory that's where we're going amen the bride hallelujah is judged hallelujah in christ jesus we are accepted in the beloved we are made the very righteousness of god in christ this morning hallelujah you might understand that but i'll tell you what to say amen because that's the truth amen right all right all right and so the blood was put on the mercy seat we're talking about the day of atonement when this jubilee would be sounded the blood shed on the mercy seat one of these little goats had to die amen then it was shared outside on the other goat and the priest took it outside you've got all that in chapter 16 amen and and it's a wonderful thing and brother brown said that was your seven church ages the blood being shed for that and then amen that little scapegoat that's what it was called and here he was taken out and released with the blood of his meat that had died and brother branham just simply says amen that this is christ he is both them goats hallelujah so that's why i say when we can can look at it spiritually we see christ being the one that was chosen to die and the one that bore our sins outside the camp hallelujah so we're so thankful for that this morning amen but christ become a high priest as hebrews 9 if he can flick that up for you a high priest amen of the good things to come by the greater and more perfect tabernacle amen uh not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he hath entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal salvation for us we ought to be folks hallelujah you ought to be hopping in your seat this morning praise god you ought to be huffing and saying what hallelujah eternal salvation yes amen praise god we're not going to live for the millennium and say well folks i'm sorry you all gotta die now and you're obliterated you say what i thought this was only starting oh no i forgot to tell you there's a new heaven a new earth a new city a new jerusalem it's not only here in the millennium you're going into that as well oh wonderful eternal praise god it's wonderful well let me just go pop on over here you know when you look at the day of atonement it was one of the seven faiths i don't wanna linger on this but just to give you a little idea the passover as you know was typical of christ our pastor were dying for us amen we need a lamb we need a sacrifice when we find god's uh amen god's place of worship his only place of worship that is jesus christ our lord so we know that amen i did and i shouldn't really say this but i i did preach a message it's always been a real blessing to me brother weird and when brother branham says amen the word interpreted the word interpreted as a manifestation of the name of god hallelujah so when you look at all the gates there is today and you say well how do i know brother which is the right git well just then what brother bottom says and if you get the right interpretation you'll get the right gift hallelujah because it will be a manifestation of the name of god hallelujah and that's exactly what it is a manifestation of the name of god the lord jesus christ there's your gift right there you don't need any argument about it you know somebody may turn around and say well i we we believe in our church it has to be in the name of the father son and holy ghost interpret the word that jesus said right there and it has to be a manifestation of the name of god it's the name of the father son and holy ghost the manifestation of his name amen is certainly not his name as the lord jesus christ did peter have it amen right there wherever you're listening to this did peter have it on the day of pentecost don't ever try and tell me he didn't have it on the day of pentecost ten days before he had a resurrected jesus christ and he never even bothered to tell him that you're going to preach a false doctrine and the first day of the church is born amen folks you don't don't hallelujah you just don't do it amen hallelujah he had thus set the lord on the day of pentecost praise god amen sure did why because that word interpreted was a manifestation of the name of jesus christ that's why and that's how you know it just put it to the test the unleavened bread is communion with christ amen i'm not going to say anymore because you could stop anywhere here but i want to push on real hard and yeah and then the the first fruit say amen a type of the resurrection praise the lord that he has become the first fruits of them that slept he was the first one on many he shall bring with him amen and you could say more in these things i'm just running them down and then the feast of pentecost which was the anti-type there of the descent of the holy spirit uh on the day of of pentecost amen when he come down into the church amen hallelujah so we we know all about that amen and that was 50 days i want you to keep that in mind that was 50 days after amen the feast of the first fruit 50 deaths amen then the feast of the trumpets which was uh uh it refers in future to the regathering of israel brother branham wanted to preach the seven trumpets and he wondered why i could never just hit it right until it was shown to them amen it's not far to church it's for israel hallelujah you know i mean as much as we want to know about these things i ain't going to be here hallelujah amen so but i know they're going to have their trumpets hallelujah and i know they're going to have that seventh that a day of atonement trumpet is going to sign for them hallelujah like this trumpet will sign for us amen now and then of course you have the day of atonement which we've just described to you there's actually there was a more of it there about um they had a a a bullock as well you know and that was where the the finger was stepped seven times but you can read it hallelujah but it's all a type of christ all a type of christ amen no i and and the feast of tabernacles of course a memorial prophetical a reminder as to the redemption out of egypt prophetical as to the kingdom rest of israel after her end gathering and restoration and i tell you what god's word does not miss it hallelujah you know his brother samuel last night was explaining to us you know and and when you look at all the years amen and and the way man have changed it all around but i'll tell you when you see it there hallelujah with your red glasses on amen it all fits in amen and so that's one thing i'd never do is ever try to tell god he's wrong do you say amen to that hallelujah you know whatever it is don't you tell him he's wrong hallelujah and i'll tell you what friends and i mean this sincerely you know when moses was up the mount and they started to play around down there getting false gods and all the rest of it you know he just came down the mountain and he said who is on the lord's side who's on the lord's side now i might say a bit more about that later on he said let him stand by me come on here right by me and there'll be two camps and if you're here with me on the lord's side hallelujah then we'll see what's going to happen so you've got to stay with the word you've got to stay with the prophet the message hallelujah that's been delivered because if you believe it's got flaws in it then you look at the word of god there's flaws in it that's nonsense hallelujah it's because you don't understand it enough that you'll come out with it like that well the year of jubilee the acceptable year of the lord amen praise the lord did you notice brother branham said we have some of the same customs jesus he read the scriptures and business teaching on the scripture amen it was contrary sometimes to what the jewish people thought it was but yet you could and who could accuse him he was the lord of glory hallelujah and we read in isaiah he uh anointed me to preach the acceptable year of the lord amen now hallelujah this day this word has been fulfilled in you amen so many times years before the event god speaks it amen and the lord spoke it but he says this day this scripture is fulfilled what a glorious thing it is for that amen and and just say that uh he says here uh amen now the acceptable year of the lord uh and this during this time between so many years the acceptable year is the year called in the old writings the year of jubilee amen jesus had the greatest anointing of any man that was ever on earth is that right one day he went into the temple he picked it up and he read it hallelujah and the lord preached the acceptable year of the lord to the captives amen a jubilee if you weren't in captivity well it would mean nothing to you but when you were in sin and you were born in sin like i was born in sin hallelujah but when you heard a message that jesus christ had died for you and you came in repentance hallelujah man you come into your jubilee right now yes you did hallelujah you heard a trumpet sign amen you heard a trumpet sign amen and so when he speaks preaching this here the trumpet sign the jubilee the priest come in and that priest earned it amen and you could drop your hole praise the lord the devil had no part over you that day hallelujah no you were born a son you were a son amen like the prodigal was a son amen he was his father's son hallelujah but you know something uh he wasn't in his father's will eating pig's food what father would give his son pigs food i don't know what hallelujah amen but this guy he went that way but he he realized he came to his correct senses and he came back to the father's house amen so so that's where it is and we heard the trumpet sound hallelujah and and we could drop that hole and walk right into christ amen and and you know the devil couldn't stop us he could not stop his brother hallelujah amen we were free indeed amen from that and we're so glad this morning now the sounding of the jubilee when we heard the sound and it was a joyful sign you know we've often sang that song that you've heard the joyful sign jesus saves jesus seems that's a joyful sign amen hallelujah and it is not an uncertain sign and you know there might be some people even in here today praise god you started to come to church and you're not all sure what it's all about but i'll tell you start there hallelujah start right there with jesus christ stay man and and you know it's not an uncertain sign you know we have a little thing it's an advertisement back home and the guy would hold up i'll just take a little zipless and thank you and he would hold up a tin of paint and he's not going to give a big spool about it he just says it does what it says on the 10. you got that it does what it says on the 10. hallelujah and and that's right and you know this is when you come to the gospel it does exactly what it says in the book amen hallelujah if you come up for him it will do exactly what it says in the book no matter what it is it could be healing this morning hallelujah i don't know but i know god's a healer i've seen him doing it many many times over yes i never stops healing people that's it's just in his nature he's a healer and he he paid the price so no matter what i'm carrying today i know that he was wept to the very bone that i could be healed hallelujah amen and that's what we believe amen now i praise the lord this trumpet would make a distinction for it was the 50th year sign amen and i'll tell you what that every slave could be brought in as i said later when that last trump signs and the dead in christ rise what a jubilee that's going to be what would you believe to see her you know i you mightn't think this but when i come across here nearly every church brother samuel has got on their walls those who have went past amen there's a brother jimmy gibson you know and i can actually nearly hear his voice harry harry you know sister robin down there you know sister gayle i can hear their voice i know that lovely georgia voice amen har they spoke hallelujah he may have been ten to say you know but praise the lord you know what i mean and and just how they spoke and it's the same up there when i was up there in durham you know i can remember oh he must be dead for years but he almost spoke like billy andrews he had a very high pitched voice you know and and but i can hear it still hallelujah and i know that they're somewhere they're in another dimension somewhere just waiting for us hallelujah the same as the prophet is and what a day when when they appeared and when the the dead in christ rise and we which will remain whoever that's going to be hallelujah shall meet the lord in the air amen and it's wonderful praise the lord well let me just pop on down here for me because i i'll leave some of this out amen so he says that gospel is the the trumpet there and who preached it christ and you just type that into your computer and it'll come up exactly where where he said that that you know and it's wonderful they owed a debt that they could never pay that's a glorious thing to be a debtor hallelujah and and see someone pay your debt amen and jesus spoke about it when he said that this man they're bringing in the debtors and one owed them a lot of money and the other one wrote him a little bit less or whatever not but he forgive them both then the man that came back and said hold on a minute you know you forgive him and what about me you know the lord says no well you're not both forgiven but you're not both debtors amen it's up to me i can forgive who i will so that's a wonderful thing in other words you may have sent great great sins but i'll tell you what he can reach down to the lowest hell hallelujah you might have been brought up in a christian home hallelujah you never learned a curse in school and and and you know you learned honesty in your home hallelujah but you realize that in your little heart there was still that sin hallelujah but he still forgives you as well as he can forgive the harlot in the street absolutely wonderful and that's what we need to know okay now praise the lord yeah yeah i'm glad the devil's not my task master today ah sure i'm glad of that i've got a good a good boss hallelujah if you want to call him that amen i love working for the lord hallelujah amen he pays good wages and i'm not talking about uh finances or nothing like that he just pays good wages hallelujah he looks after you on the job there's a lot of benefits with working for the lord hallelujah and i'm so thankful for that amen and you know they all as the prophet said here amen some people wouldn't have heard it you know uh and and they don't hear it today and their ears gonna be bored brother branham said it uh and isn't it strange folks that today i don't know how you feel but you know something when you see a man with rings on his ears i mean to say a man what what's all that about what's all out about you know have you even said him hey sir why have you got them rings in this here they probably couldn't even tell you you know but i'll tell you what what you could say to him is excuse me if you don't mind me saying that but in god's bible that was that was thrown upon hallelujah amen that's not the be you are assuring that you're a subject to someone who isn't god that's what you're showing amen it's the same as tattoos you know all your famous sportsmen and you say how do you know about our sportsmen what they do because they turn it all over the world they're all tattooed during the their arms are all tattooed when you see them you know in the newspaper whatever not you know what i'm talking about tattoos the this book rejects that hallelujah tells you not to do that amen but you they're they're showing you what god they're under in this age yes they are yes they are amen so praise the lord i thought that i would put that in amen and you know brother brown says you refused that gospel light that word of your hour amen and preached in the power of the holy ghost and he said you'll see yourself into your eternal a destination hallelujah so i mean that's what they're doing they're showing where they are and where they're going i hope they all enjoy their their money praise the lord i tell you what what good what a 50 million dollars do you when someone says you'll not see the day out you'll be dead you tell me what you're going to do with it you know you better spend it fast if you've never been to hawaii you better move fast if you're going today that evening i'll tell you and what good would that even do you if you did get the hawaii and you're going to die that evening that's no good folks amen praise the lord just keep your eye on your eternal uh the destination sealed the holy ghost sealed in and the devil sealed out amen hallelujah okay that seven day rest amen if he was a free born and true blood of israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back amen he could go back to his inheritance what a glorious thing our bible is that god would bring in these things that he knew mine needed hallelujah getting feeling dying lord my i've been working for this guy all these years but we're not jubilee horns hallelujah just as the prophet said to turn his old brother and walk night hallelujah i'm free amen hallelujah it must you know uh it must have been wonderful amen when when when lincoln put that proclamation out amen you know but that didn't free anybody they were still under under the the slavery thing but you know when that amendment i don't know if it was the 13th or whatever it was but you know when that went into law hallelujah you're free hallelujah nobody can ever say you're not free you are free hallelujah by the law of the land and we're free today in christ jesus amen hallelujah the wall city brother branham just says this and i've got five more minutes or so and i'll be on there i think from when i started but the wall city brother brother said that's the trouble today you've got people all in the walls today now of course you think about it if it sounded outside amen you mightn't hear it in the wall city and he says today amen actually what is happening is that people are living in wall cities and they don't hear the sound they don't hear that certain amen and praise the lord uh amen he said that's that's your denominations you can live in a wall city and you can say no i don't believe that amen but our church teaches us well you're in a wall city i'll tell you what and one day i think you'll regret that hallelujah one day amen so i praise the lord now listen to this amen okay ah and and uh and azusa street the pentecostal jubilee i like this what brother bradham said about that he said god pulled his elected church out of them denominations 50 years ago god pulled out that remnant he said this is the jubilee he's calling again return jubilee 50 years ago god pulled them out and tonight he said he's trying to do it again so god wants his art of the system art of the denomination art of the spirit of the world out of the spirit of of of antichrist hallelujah and the his spirit amen and we're free and we're free indeed and i love that to be in this place today i really do hallelujah and i if i may just because i've got a few little things here uh to say before i finish up amen from the pentecostal feast to the the day of atonement it was the longest stretch longest stretch of time amen and uh you know it says that uh in the book of acts after the ascension and the crucifixion amen uh from from there the day that the lord raised from the dead amen then the pentecost was 50 but then from from pentecost to the day of atonement amen and uh the outpouring of the holy spirit that brought in our church kids that's actually that's actually where there'll be such a gap because god uh finished dealing with the jews and we got our chance thank god hallelujah amen thank god we got our chance because folks you do not realize when god turned around and said amen that we were without hope and without god i'm a third hope in this life amen my my what a place we were in what a place we were in but you know thank god that he had mercy on the gentiles hallelujah and not only mercy brother joe but he brought in a gentile bride hallelujah not even like a jewish bride to sit with him there uh as the queen but a gentile bride hallelujah and that's us and i'm thankful for god for that tonight amen we're not servants we're sons hallelujah we're friends amen as we said before that when john our our representative put his head here he could hear the heartbeat of jesus christ and jesus told him the secret of that moment that it would be judas that would betray him amen so that's where we are we've got the ear of the master because he's our husband today i preached uh i never had preached on adonia before amen but you know our lord he said you call me lord you call me i don't eye and you say well for so i am and if i am you're a donai your husband your master amen your lord hallelujah then he said amen you should do what i'm doing amen and we do uh praise the lord washington defeat and the communion so praise the lord amen now if i just may and you know when brother branham talked about the holy spirit coming he said and today that's what he's doing he's waving his word over us you know you would be surprised if you knew what was happening to you today that the word of god is going forth hallelujah you're amen in the word and you'd be surprised what it's doing on your inside hallelujah amen no i okay i maybe just hit that a little bit later on amen what is going on on the inside praise the lord so come expect an amen and uh okay and and brother brahma said he said from that time the people around the world are having a jubilee shouting the victory now okay the pentecost started the church heads and we know that loducion church when the last seat is in that'll finish the church age no more but after that then you'll find that the jews as we go end of the rapture the jews will be maneuvered in amen into their time hallelujah and i will see that it's all for one reason as far as god's concerned and that will be to get them to their day of atonement amen to get them to what we what we and only this time there'd be new man over in jerusalem killing a sheep hallelujah amen hallelujah they'll see the real skip goat hallelujah amen they'll see the real skip gold amen why because brother branham says it you can tape it and get it up there sister the legal owner is coming back hallelujah the legal owner is coming back has anybody in this room this morning and he died said he's coming back hallelujah i believe the lord is coming back like he said hallelujah like he said i believe that the heavens cannot contain amen when all of them cedar in it'll be all over and we say no wonder with john even so lord jesus come now please just give me because i want to just uh i have something here just at the close of it amen praise the lord amen and it's not going to be anything that you've never heard before probably you've heard it deeper amen that i even gave it to you this morning amen but praise the lord uh the feast of trumpets and the trumpet sign a long period of time amen 50 days seven sabbaths that's the church ages he said do you get it now the jews have been blinded within all this time while the pentecostal firstfruits have been poured out amen okay so that's the seven sabbaths he said amen and of course it's been two thousand years amen of course that and we know that amen but exactly the seven sabbaths uh the pentecostal jubilee the weaving of the sheaf the resurrection and then uh the outpouring of the holy spirit and then right up to the feast of trumpets that's god's order that's what he said in order not me not brother you're not blood or weird amen but i'll tell you that's what he said in order and that's exactly what's going to happen and i love that hallelujah i love that i i really do love that amen and noi ah amen okay uh yeah so at this time uh from the pentecostal priesthood choose your last servant now they've got to be called back he says to their death atonement not okay uh and and really i'm just about finishing now just give me a few more moments and uh praise the lord but i want to just hit this as well amen um yeah after that long period of pentecost will change in the calling out of the bride and the bride is called out by a servant we know that as brother branham and praise the lord then israel goes to their feast of atonement so that's all in there in chapter 16 he says amen now and then uh let me see there would be the morning that's what he says where did you receive these wounds see and it's the only in this place it's called israel to mourn for their sins hallelujah and you could divert anywhere you want it amen but it's in this place it's not going to be in ireland they're not going to gather in ireland or uganda they're going to gather in israel hallelujah on the mount of sinai amen 144 000 as we're just going with the word we're going by the message hallelujah and if the prophet said it i believe it amen that's all i can tell you this morning no i so moses and elijah got to come amen and i'm not finished yet but just give me another few moments praise the lord moses and elijah got to come it's not refreshing and you know something also sister and brother they can't come to we're gone hallelujah they can't come i mean there's no way that you're going to read in the paper one day two men appear in israel and preach it you're going to read it hallelujah i mean i don't think so anyway but i'll tell you what because when they come on the scene full blast we will be gone amen we will be gone we we gotta go that they can move in amen and it'll be to israel the gentiles will be shot out in darkness amen and it's almost there and i i i'm sure you can say amen this morning when i say this and you don't look i was talking to an israeli ambassador and we had a wonderful supper with him an evening meal up in donegal where i live and his wife was there and he was there all his security was away down somewhere else and it was just him and my family and i thought that was one of the highlights ever that god would give me is to have the israeli ambassador at my table amen and that night we had a wonderful time and i said to him you know i said mr ambassador i or just ambassador i said i wish that i could tell you your hard days are over i said but i cannot i said jacob's trouble has yet to come but it will come but god will deliver them out of it hallelujah that's wonderful god will deliver him out of it so they have to come the pentecostal they said the being prophets they believe they'll believe him calling them to the feast of atonement letting them recognize christ and and that's the way it's going to be just exactly the way the word says it's going to be and they'll recognize christ amen wounded in the house of my friends now and and closing off and we we talked about these things last night a little bit seventy uh there's a brother over in ireland and he's over in scotland and he's turning 70 in september and i said well that's a good number because 70 in the bible is the number prior to increase amen the number when you hit 70 after that it's increased hallelujah amen so you look forward to whatever you want with but i'll tell you why i've been waiting a long time to be increased you know but it is amen because after they come out of the captivity praise the lord they went into increase again amen god blessed the land and they had left idolatry behind them amen no so god a jubilee every 49th year the 50th year was the jubilee we talked about the church ages there a little bit and i want to say this this morning because i know i've got the freedom to sit here but listen amen so we understand that from the first jubilee leviticus 25 it in 1977 uh will be the seventh jubilee now i'll tell you what i ain't gonna argue without brother samuel that's what he said hallelujah amen if i believe the message praise god and and when when i had that that dream of brother branham he said just brother brother preach the word that is my message hallelujah so he said that i believe that that makes a 70-year jubilee a 70th jubilee three four three oh years means that going up the release did you get that god will deal with us exactly the same amount of time that he dealt with the jews now brother samuel can explain that all to you amen and break it all down for you but i'm just saying it as he read it there hallelujah and we believe that uh abraham the promise until the rejection of the messiah 80 33 was one nine five four years and i know he went through it with you and so and i believe it what he's taught hallelujah and so amen uh right unto the we've got 17 years left now until 77 which will be the seventh jubilee since the beginning of jubilees and oh brother watch close night don't miss it it'll be the jubilee of the going up of the gentile bride and the return of christ to the jews when they go out of their bondage again don't you say for all the world they'll gather for that day hallelujah so we know that you say hold on brother i was 77. amen so we are now in 2014. well you know brother dick i am a simple man praise the lord and i love country people hallelujah amen and i'm a simple man and you say how do you explain that well let me just put it like this i know your posture is split far deeper and brother where i know he can't do that but just i would just put it like this brother branham said if it does pass 77 it will squeeze awful hard to get through and it has squeezed awful hard to get through i i do believe that god could have done anything in 1977 but we're still here and in my little humble way saying it we're in the delay amen i know with the years and times and and all that there your pastor can do that and i can accept that hallelujah but i'll tell you what we're just in the delay there's nothing more to be fulfilled hallelujah amen nothing more there's no grit nothing's coming we are ready hallelujah for a body change ready for a body tunes and you know uh you should be praying that every day you get up out of your bed hallelujah it could be the day this could be the hour amen and so that's all i would call it amen and this is just winding down i praise the lord just wind it up all finished amen and now in the days of solomon anybody knows when god sent his gifts to the world the world receives it the church receives it then it's a golden jubilee well i'll tell you what then that means the brides and the goldens you believe today hallelujah for we have received the word of our day we've received the revealed word of our art amen and thank god for that hallelujah he talks about russia and this is very briefly because it failed to receive the jubilee message of the baptism of the holy ghost russia he said they've turned over to a rapid mind what i said earlier and i never finished it you're born to see outside souls that are in prison now i'll tell you what if you've got any spirituality about you you've seen souls that are in prison nine and you could never get them out of that prison like the man that was in the wall city and he got his ear bored to to the master he loves the devil hallelujah he'll never hear it he never you'd be wasting your breath hallelujah the bible said don't cast your pearls before a swine that's what you would be doing they're wrapped up in mines hallelujah they're all there the man of sin it's all there that spirit is moving but the spirit is moving in us as well hallelujah praise god he is and i love it and i'll tell you what there's nothing like this work of god amen and and he said now brother america has 40 years of old fashioned apostolic preaching the jubilee year and it won't receive it as a nation that's your country and how much i have loved america amen not loved it enough to come and live here but loved it yeah you don't believe me so you don't hey man i'll tell you i was talking to a little little woman the other day there brother david farmer you know him well i'm sure he lives up in virginia and i was talking to his daughter and she said uh brother george could i ask you about about your uh health system and i said yes and she started asking questions so my wife was in hospital when she nearly died because the the the ovary had infected you know the and the cyst and it was very very touch and go but i'll tell you what god spurred her and she's still there god bless her and we love her dearly and you know the thing is that uh when we were talking about that she was in she was in intensive care for ages really was and uh so then she was in the whole hospital for a month and when i got the bill it came to 450 euros which let's say 600. so you go into hospital here for a month and stay in the intensive care life at 600 that would be i'm that would be for your entrance fee into the hospital so so i know all about it you know but i'd rather live in ireland if you don't mind hallelujah okay this this is all over folks amen he's just saying where america is but thank god he didn't say where you are hallelujah he didn't say where you are amen and that's wonderful now uh praise the lord uh the day we enter the millennium christ the son of david will set on the throne amen won't need the holy spirit then because of course the holy spirit will be there but we won't need him the way we do no amen praise the lord because the son of david will sit on his throne and the lord will reign over all the earth amen and praise god then all the nations is sure going to beat their play shares their swords and the pleasures amen and war is going to be over what a happy day oh happy day when there's no more wars i don't care about the big corporations that make a fortune out of making rockets and missiles but i'll tell you i'll be glad when i say what are you doing and they say we're making our swords in the plowshares to play tonight hallelujah what a day that's going to pay you know we

seem to do the best doesn't matter if there's a droid or not the weeds grow hallelujah you see but you know i've been on there in the millennium hallelujah and and brother branham just said this is my closing last line amen for today it'll be a different message this afternoon but the whole world is going to rejoice and the jubilee year will come so it's all a jubilee folks amen it's all the
