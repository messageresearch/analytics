[0:01] okay all right come back then hello
[0:10] alright so now let's go to Genesis
[0:14] chapter 29 let's watch right here in the
[0:20] book of Genesis we're going to find out
[0:22] that the Bible speaks of one week equal
[0:28] seven years you say know that brother
[0:31] branham I was a rebel lecture was a
[0:32] revelation butthead come out the Bible
[0:34] like have come out the Bible you could
[0:37] just say okay one week equal seven years
[0:38] to make it Matt sure it made it match
[0:41] but let's go and let's look at let's
[0:49] just read chapter 29 verse 17 I always
[0:52] come with a star glyph start right at 17
[0:54] now this is the story of who Jacob and
[0:57] Rachel and Liam remember Jacob loved
[1:02] Rachel but leah was the oldest sister
[1:05] right and and Laban which is the con
[1:08] artist of them all he wanted yet the
[1:11] father of Leah and Rachel he wanted
[1:13] Jacob to have Leah first so you're
[1:16] always supposed to have the first
[1:17] firstborn all right and the blessing
[1:19] goes on verse 17 so this is this is
[1:23] Rachel I mean this is jacob and Laban
[1:27] negotiating with each other verse 17 Leo
[1:31] was tenderized but Rachel was beautiful
[1:33] and well favored Jacob loved Rachel and
[1:36] said I will serve the seven years got it
[1:39] seven years for Rachel die younger guard
[1:42] and Laban said it is better that I give
[1:46] her to me then I should give her to
[1:48] another man abide with me and Jacob
[1:51] served seven years for Rachel and they
[1:53] seemed done to him just a few days man
[1:55] what a low end for that girl I seven
[1:59] years seven years Wow
[2:04] he saved herself and she did for seven
[2:07] years don't tell me we can came to I'll
[2:08] serve these seven years for Rachel
[2:10] ladies it is better Jacob surf seven
[2:12] years for Rachel and they seemed to him
[2:13] but a few days for the love he had to
[2:15] her and Jacob said unto Laban give me my
[2:18] wife for my days are fulfilled that I
[2:21] may go in unto her all right now watch
[2:25] he came to pass in even that took Leah
[2:28] his daughter and broader than him and he
[2:29] went in unto her hmm okay that's a
[2:34] little different story but we got to
[2:36] continue with the story I don't
[2:38] understand she must have been all
[2:39] wrapped up cuz Jacob couldn't see her
[2:41] see nothing but her body because he
[2:42] should figure out that wasn't who that
[2:44] was but you can't I'll this in but just
[2:47] to save time watch this cuz Laban he
[2:53] goes into labor and Laban gave unto his
[2:55] darling leone's Delta he's made for him
[2:57] to maintain fast in the morning behold
[2:58] it was live it must have been dark in
[3:00] the room was a man and he said I'd 11
[3:05] what is this the dial that's done into
[3:06] me did not I serve with thee for Rachel
[3:09] hello how many years seven years he
[3:12] served seven years for Rachel now listen
[3:15] this is a beautiful time we're with
[3:17] hostile beguile me verse 26 and Laban
[3:20] said it must not be so done in our
[3:22] country to give the young before the
[3:23] first born look at verse 27 fulfill her
[3:26] week fulfill her week it was a week it
[3:37] was seven years so one here one week
[3:40] equals seven years according to the
[3:42] model all right but you got you got to
[3:44] keep going to little tell in verse 28 it
[3:47] will keep going fulfill her week and we
[3:50] will give me this also for services down
[3:52] so served me yet seven other years so he
[3:55] had to serve seven more years to get
[3:58] Rachel him to wait seven more years when
[3:59] they have Lilly and Jacob did so and
[4:02] fulfilled her week what seven other
[4:05] years full fifth gem fulfilled her week
[4:10] one week equals like in the Bible seven
[4:15] years then you just keep going up you
[4:17] keep going on and don't say much more
[4:18] about it but there is where that I
[4:21] believe that the angel of the Lord
[4:24] probably took brother branham ins
[4:25] holding said look because what he says
[4:28] in the damn said two weeks book if
[4:30] you'll read it he says I can prove by
[4:32] the Bible that one week equal seven
[4:35] years well that's exactly the only time
[4:37] it ever is in the Bible claimed that one
[4:40] week equals seven years alright so one
[4:43] week equal seven years so now as one
[4:47] week equal seven years then we can see
[4:49] how they brother battle put all this
[4:51] together and it wasn't just 70 weeks it
[4:56] was seventy times seven now we can
[5:00] control that with a bottle when jeeta
[5:02] how much is seventy times seven 490 all
[5:06] right 490 amen 490 jesus said how many
[5:12] they said the wanting towns we forgive
[5:14] jesus said seventy times seven that's
[5:17] how long it took for him to forgive
[5:19] Israel 7b five seven four nine years
[5:25] yeah that's important because we're
[5:27] going to prove that that from the time
[5:29] of the rebuilding to Jesus was 483 years
[5:32] everybody got that yeah how many more
[5:36] years as left hello right I mean I I
[5:42] mean it's just really simple but but
[5:44] don't say don't Lillian to me I wanted
[5:48] to be simple to eat ok so now you can
[5:51] take them back to the Bible number one
[5:52] and say look we know that seven weeks
[5:54] that one week equals seven years anybody
[5:57] got them one week equals seven years
[6:00] that's always going to be that way all
[6:02] right according to the Bible so now
[6:05] during all this time we see that Jacob
[6:09] and Leah Rachel we're all together which
[6:12] is another top all together so now let's
[6:14] go to Daniel 9 where we were last week
[6:16] and let's get I want to get this I want
[6:20] to get this as a basis of of what we're
[6:25] going to talk about because I don't want
[6:28] to be just brother ground preach down 70
[6:32] weeks and that's the way it is I've
[6:35] always wanted to be able to understand
[6:37] it says si si means to understand I
[6:40] won't be able to see Daniel 70 weeks
[6:41] don't be able to understand it I want to
[6:44] be able to know that I take it back to
[6:45] the Bible and not just type of quote
[6:47] because you know if you go over here so
[6:49] well we're not supposed to eat the flesh
[6:52] of men right I will tell us not to drink
[6:55] the blood of anything alive this look to
[6:58] ask the spirit in it right we're not to
[7:02] eat anything man we're not to eat each
[7:04] other right wait a minute the Bible says
[7:08] Jesus Jesus said eat my flesh and drink
[7:10] my blood did he break scripture he can
[7:15] he was this good but you got to explain
[7:17] what he's that you've got to watch see
[7:20] or understand what Jesus is talking
[7:22] about same thing with dang 72 inch
[7:24] you're going to be able to you know you
[7:25] weren't able by the end of this thing
[7:27] hopefully to be able to explain it step
[7:30] by step because remember one week equals
[7:33] seven years that's constant so remember
[7:35] the
[7:36] I will says one week equal seven years
[7:38] before even Jeremiah came about so it's
[7:42] in the Bible it's not just because you
[7:43] read her brother brown suit one week
[7:45] equals seven years you said well that's
[7:46] just what the Prophet says that's what
[7:48] they're saying lotsa fun Thomas with no
[7:49] viable thing about he was remember he
[7:52] was a word prophet he wasn't a false
[7:55] prophet he was a word prophet so
[7:57] whatever he got he got from the word
[7:59] alright so now let's listen to Daniel's
[8:04] prayer don't you though and don't you
[8:09] two get into this right here now what
[8:11] we're going to do is is next week we're
[8:16] going to take the first section which is
[8:21] what the seven first the seven years
[8:24] which is 49 here seven first seven weeks
[8:26] remember there's a three advice to keep
[8:29] reading that do you read daniel 9 24 to
[8:31] live until you can't almost recited
[8:34] extreme periods 762 and seven no 762 and
[8:40] 162 and seven is 69 they've one week
[8:44] left all right all right so you got a
[8:46] seven-week 62 and a one-week our one
[8:50] week equal seven years all right so
[8:54] there's seven years left after the
[8:55] rapture according to the Bible so
[8:57] brother Brian can't say anything
[8:58] different to that all right see that
[9:02] explains my brother branham if you got
[9:04] your chart this is the chart he drew and
[9:07] like I said before if anybody online
[9:09] wants to look at it again the clicks on
[9:12] here this chart according to brother
[9:14] George Smith and this chart according to
[9:18] brother George Smith they're right on
[9:19] top of that thing this chart according
[9:22] to George Smith is walk from Becca drew
[9:24] on the tabernacle chalkboard and did it
[9:28] again and put it on a piece of paper and
[9:32] I call this up and this is this is one
[9:35] of the this is not the original copy but
[9:37] it is a chart of Daniel seventy weeks as
[9:40] drawn by brother William Brown
[9:42] if I got that this is what he grew on
[9:44] the on the blackboard at church now
[9:48] there's another one and it's up let me
[9:52] see that behind that anything yeah let
[9:55] me see this one now people say well we
[9:57] don't know if that's true or not we're
[9:58] Bridal brother Jordan Smith said Rebecca
[9:59] doesn't want it done and approve and
[10:01] prove that she's the one that did this
[10:03] chart exactly the way brother round
[10:05] preached it alright so a few weeks later
[10:08] there was a brother this is come this
[10:10] comes from brother Homer Brown from
[10:13] Jacksonville Florida older brother San
[10:17] Augustine Florida he's an older brothers
[10:19] in his eighties but either he or one of
[10:23] his associates asked brother branham two
[10:26] weeks later to draw the chart again and
[10:28] explain it to him a restaurant so this
[10:31] his wife was drawn by brother branham
[10:36] himself all right
[10:41] this is brother Browns handwriting this
[10:44] is what he drew drew my brother William
[10:45] Brown for a brother that was at a
[10:47] restaurant with brother branham in 1961
[10:49] he grew the exact same chart okay don't
[10:54] look exactly the same but it's the same
[10:56] chart all right so this is the
[10:59] confirmation to me that I mean you want
[11:01] to sing the people in the ministers
[11:03] meetings trying to draw their own charts
[11:04] well I think I think I'll stick with the
[11:06] one that brother branham drifted right
[11:08] and then try to understand it according
[11:10] to what we drink I try to produce my own
[11:12] idea and then draw a chart did that
[11:15] coincides with that so and surprisingly
[11:20] when we did the Dana 70 week series
[11:22] there was many many many many many
[11:24] probably eighty percent of the ministers
[11:26] had never seen this chart we've been in
[11:28] this message 50 years and they hadn't
[11:30] even studied enough to see what brother
[11:32] round upset but now we're going to read
[11:34] this today and like I said before this
[11:38] is not a Salvation issue you said well I
[11:41] don't understand it unless be lost no no
[11:43] no no no you understand that a man died
[11:47] on the cross for you and he saved your
[11:50] soul okay now that is in the Daniel 70
[11:55] weeks cuz he died I left okay he died
[11:59] right there okay he's riding riding
[12:01] right in the the part that he spoke to
[12:04] clay and we're in the part that was
[12:07] supposed to play there's the Gentiles
[12:08] remember 70 weeks an angle doesn't have
[12:11] anything to do with the gym huh she let
[12:13] ya there's a gap right there that's what
[12:16] I always say right here he come down
[12:19] took the part out from the Jews when i'm
[12:23] done and got me right and he's going
[12:25] around back to the jew churches that
[12:27] went back to the g1 right back to the
[12:30] dude all right if I have any question
[12:32] for that so far so far but he died at
[12:37] caroling to save your soul now the
[12:40] seventy weeks of Daniel the
[12:41] understanding of the seventy weeks of
[12:43] Daniel number one if brother branham
[12:45] preached it we ought to be able to
[12:47] understand
[12:47] because I don't think he preached
[12:48] anything that he that he went to his
[12:50] grave that we didn't need to know that
[12:52] we needed to know that he didn't tell us
[12:55] and explain to us now they're worse
[12:56] things he took to his grave with that
[12:58] was for him personally he said that
[12:59] right but it was not for the bride as a
[13:02] whole okay the but if he preached three
[13:06] series of of Daniel 70 week then it must
[13:10] be important like I said last Sunday
[13:12] it's not a Salvation issue doesn't mean
[13:15] you're lost if you don't understand it
[13:16] but it is a growth issue it's a growth
[13:20] issue you can't grow past if you have an
[13:23] idea in your mind and it's wrong
[13:25] according to the Bible I don't see how
[13:27] we make up change of the body with a
[13:29] wrong sure we're going to have human
[13:31] thoughts and ideas but but to come down
[13:36] to the basis of what the Bible teaches
[13:38] if we don't have that because remember
[13:41] Jesus come on earth he was the word
[13:43] that's right he couldn't come contrary
[13:46] he came exactly the way the word said
[13:49] you say well we can't sure we can
[13:51] contrary to the word but once the one
[13:53] that is the word comes in to us and we
[13:57] allow them yes we are saying it right
[13:59] and we allow them to work we're still
[14:03] free moral agents even though we're
[14:04] bride of Jesus Christ we're still free
[14:06] moral agent we still can say no don't go
[14:09] in that door or no I can't understand
[14:11] that well then you just shut yourself
[14:13] off there be no growth up the statue of
[14:16] a perfect man without getting deep
[14:18] because you know what you we can't take
[14:21] a body change with a question Jesus did
[14:23] not take a body change with a question
[14:26] he knew who he was and when you come out
[14:29] at grave he said all power and him
[14:31] another's been given unto me well that's
[14:33] the same thing you're not going to say
[14:40] I understand that first one but the
[14:43] second part is are you saying that those
[14:46] who do not understand this habit they're
[14:49] not they're saved but they have to go by
[14:51] the great that's great absolutely
[14:53] absolutely I do not believe you can take
[14:56] a body change with any error you can't
[15:00] or why Paul that pole I someone said
[15:03] about stacking perfect man Paul M sugar
[15:05] took a rapture according to just that
[15:07] chart where it says holy spirit but they
[15:10] didn't have that love the mystery under
[15:12] the seals is what changes our body okay
[15:17] time to loose ends together why do we
[15:19] need a prophet to give us back to the
[15:22] word man to guess and then the son of
[15:25] man we been to it for months the Son of
[15:28] Man ministry is different from the Son
[15:30] of God minister but it's not it's
[15:34] inclusive right it's inclusive it's not
[15:37] well we doing away with the son of god
[15:38] men know that son of God's what saved
[15:40] your soul the son of man the ones are
[15:43] going to change your body this outside
[15:44] man yes hey man because remember the Son
[15:49] of God stood in the son of man in a man
[15:51] named Jesus right so the fullness of the
[15:55] Godhead body was in him but now the same
[15:57] fullness is in you in a part don't call
[16:01] the ocean so the same ability so don't
[16:03] tell me that the same ability that you
[16:05] have one discount spoonful the ocean
[16:07] every element that's in that great big
[16:09] ocean is in that one spoonful that's the
[16:12] part what we're doing is is where Jesus
[16:14] told us that we were able with him yeah
[16:20] denied the Bible say we're hairs and
[16:23] join us join us this not this join their
[16:26] whatever he had we can have but why
[16:30] brother drown say Creed's dogmas ideas
[16:35] man's idea has eroded the effect of the
[16:39] word of God can't kill words I just make
[16:41] the effect of it well I don't believe
[16:44] that will not believe in that don't make
[16:46] it not true
[16:48] but Jesus official word and Jesus was
[16:51] the word and the people leave did then
[16:53] you gotta believe a man so why do you
[16:57] think brother I'm spent all this time
[16:58] preaching all these sermons so that we
[17:00] can sit here today and what heats this
[17:02] puzzle back together for ourselves and
[17:05] not how I mean we can have a beautiful
[17:07] picture but the cows in the top of the
[17:09] tree you can graphs we should be on the
[17:11] ground that's what brother Brandon was
[17:13] talking about we have many great
[17:15] ministers decreasing very well servants
[17:19] but they can't understand and seventy
[17:21] weeks well then their people can't
[17:23] understand damage they knew it so did I
[17:25] take a body change I don't think so
[17:28] that's how important that every major
[17:32] issue that brother branham brought he
[17:34] did not bring it just to fill in take
[17:36] space no did not bring it to fill in
[17:41] takes back he brought it to where God
[17:44] can reveal it to us if we have the same
[17:48] Jesus inside of us if Jesus could
[17:50] understand it that he's expecting us to
[17:52] understand that's why this is a
[17:53] wonderful time yet it's an awful time
[17:56] because all the words been brought forth
[17:58] but only a small group of people is
[18:00] going to really understand it to the
[18:01] change of the body so going by the grave
[18:05] is not a bad thing but as long as I'm
[18:09] alive and remain I'm not a part of that
[18:12] day Paul today without us you know come
[18:15] be made perfect so I want to say it it
[18:17] is long and i'm alive i'm gonna try to
[18:19] understand all i can man the book is
[18:23] open the book is open we can go get a
[18:26] sermon and read it if we want to write
[18:29] and we can study it or we can just say
[18:31] well i'll let brother let brother Dale
[18:33] are always playing to me you're going to
[18:35] have to do a little bit of studying
[18:37] yourself because you're going to have a
[18:38] few questions and you're going to say
[18:40] well did you mean this or do you mean
[18:42] that okay so you really got a really got
[18:46] to focus on we're not going to get to
[18:47] this again
[18:50] let's read I'm going to read this and
[18:53] you just follow along because I want to
[18:56] say this is the stage that we're going
[18:57] to set bring your books next Sundy
[19:00] really because we're going to go we're
[19:01] going to start through that one section
[19:03] that he's talking about okay now this is
[19:06] this is why this is daniel in the 68th
[19:10] year he's reading jeremiah and he's in
[19:12] his soul he's troubled lord there's two
[19:16] more years left what are we going to do
[19:17] how's it going to be done and what's
[19:19] going to happen all right in the first
[19:21] year of Darius the son of a source of
[19:23] the seat of the meats which was made
[19:24] king over the realm of the child in in
[19:27] the first year of his reign and I Daniel
[19:29] understood by book Jeremiah we
[19:31] understand my books the prophet of God
[19:33] cemented the number of years the number
[19:36] of the years where of the word of the
[19:38] Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that
[19:39] he would accomplish 70 years in the
[19:41] desolation of Israel and I set my face
[19:45] into the Lord God you seek by prayer and
[19:46] supplication with vast in sackcloth and
[19:49] ashes he was pretty sincere and I prayed
[19:52] unto the Lord my God and made my
[19:53] confession and said Oh Lord the Great
[19:55] and dreadful God keeping the covenant
[19:58] and mercy to them that love him to them
[20:01] that keep his Commandments we have
[20:03] sinned and committed iniquity and have
[20:06] done wickedly and have rebelled even by
[20:08] the party from thy precepts and from thy
[20:10] judgment neither have we hearken unto
[20:12] thy servants the prophets which spake in
[20:14] thy name to our kings are Prince's our
[20:16] fathers to all the people of the land o
[20:18] Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee
[20:22] but in to us confusion a face let's see
[20:24] that's what's happening today as at this
[20:27] day we brought it right up to date any
[20:31] as to this day to the men of Judah to
[20:34] the inhabitants of Jerusalem to all
[20:36] Israel that are near and far off through
[20:38] all the countries remember they're still
[20:39] scattered where the down that's driven
[20:41] them because of their trespasses have
[20:43] trespassed against they remember hands
[20:45] were scattered try brother branham solid
[20:48] when Israel started
[20:49] back to the homeland he said god only
[20:50] deals with Israel in their homeland well
[20:52] for all them years they were scattered
[20:53] but now they're back in their homeland

[21:11] his laws which he set before us by
[21:14] servants to profit yay all Israel have
[21:17] transgressed the law even by departing
[21:19] that they might not obey thy voice
[21:21] therefore the curse is poured upon us
[21:24] and the oath that is written in the law
[21:26] of Moses the servant of God because we
[21:28] have sinned against him and he had
[21:31] confirmed his words which he spake

[23:47] while I was speaking and praying and
[23:49] confessing my sin in the sin of my
[23:51] people Israel and presenting myself
[23:53] occasionally for the Lord my God for the
[23:55] holy mountain of my god so he's prepped
[23:56] for the people in city right yay mala
[23:59] was speaking in prayer even the man
[24:02] Gabriel because what is gable gable is
[24:04] the announcement angel he's the Angel to
[24:06] Israel all right who might have seen in
[24:09] the vision at the beginning being caused
[24:11] to fly swiftly touched me about the time
[24:13] of the evening oblation so in the
[24:15] evening time is where the understanding
[24:16] is going to come all right the evening
[24:19] sacrifice are what the evening time all
[24:22] right and he informed me and talk with
[24:24] me and said Oh Daniel I'm now come forth
[24:26] to give the skill and understanding at
[24:30] the beginning of my supplication the
[24:31] commandment came forth and I am come to
[24:33] show thee for thou art greatly beloved
[24:35] therefore understand the matter and
[24:38] consider the vision all right and here's
[24:40] what it is seventy weeks are determined
[24:42] upon thy City and upon the holy city I
[24:45] wished you would write that down
[24:47] somewhere people city cheers Jerusalem
[24:50] that's two things that Daniel seventy
[24:51] weeks is gotta deal with but if you
[24:54] don't have seven years left after the
[24:56] rapture you can't build to see anybody
[24:57] they say no you got 1260 days to preach
[25:00] and the two prophets are killed and they
[25:02] go to heaven that's not all the Bible
[25:03] that's not to the sea
[25:05] the city's got to be built that
[25:07] something's going to happen to that city
[25:09] all right seventy weeks are determined
[25:11] upon thy people not and upon the holy
[25:13] city two things to do six teams to
[25:16] finish the transgression make an end of
[25:18] sin make reconciliation for iniquity now
[25:20] that's for the people that's their sin
[25:23] that's their what that's their
[25:25] justification sanctification to baptism
[25:27] of the Holy Ghost Rider all right bring
[25:31] in everlasting righteousness how can you
[25:32] do that in 1260 days when you're trying
[25:35] to preach Redemption to the people you
[25:36] can't do that so you got to have time
[25:37] left sail up the vision and prophecy
[25:40] bought in the people and anoint the most
[25:42] holy that can't happen in 1260 days
[25:44] that's going to happen after years was
[25:46] redeemed so there's got to be more times
[25:48] than three and a half years left after
[25:49] the rapture according to the Bible know
[25:52] therefore and understand or see that
[25:54] from the going forth of the commandment
