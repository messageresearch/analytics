[0:14] oh
[0:28] amen
[0:42] foreign
[1:10] me
[1:12] everybody say praise the lord
[1:15] all right let's read our scriptures
[1:16] together if we can in matthew
[1:19] matthew chapter 7 it is good to be in
[1:21] the house of the lord with you tonight
[1:23] damn it good to see you all
[1:26] out on a wednesday night it's coming
[1:28] rainy and
[1:30] and cool and this time
[1:33] last week we had well on thursday last
[1:36] week we were supposed to
[1:37] we were up in canada we got a foot and a
[1:39] half of snow on thursday night so
[1:43] all right let's read our scriptures
[1:44] together matthew chapter seven
[1:47] you're going to know this one very well
[1:49] you could probably look back in your
[1:52] in your years of being in church and
[1:54] have heard it preached on many times
[1:57] verse 24 therefore whosoever heareth
[2:00] these sayings of mine and doeth them
[2:03] i will liken him unto a wise man which
[2:05] built his house
[2:07] upon a rock and the rain descended and
[2:09] the floods came and the winds blew and
[2:11] beat up on that house
[2:13] and it fell not for it was founded upon
[2:15] a rock and everyone that
[2:17] here at these sayings of mine and doeth
[2:19] them not shall be likened into a foolish
[2:21] man which built his house upon the sand
[2:24] the rain descended and the floods came
[2:26] and the winds blew
[2:28] and beat upon that house and it fell and
[2:31] great was the fall of it and it came to
[2:33] pass
[2:34] when jesus said into these sayings the
[2:36] people were astonished at his doctrine
[2:39] right now like verse 29 40 taught them
[2:41] as one having authority
[2:43] right and not as the scribes exactly and
[2:46] it wonderful that you can tell the
[2:47] difference
[2:49] between the scribes and him let's just
[2:51] pray father as we look into the word
[2:53] tonight and have a
[2:54] little time around the the word of life
[2:57] that's left here for us we pray you'll
[2:59] say something that'll quicken and happen
[3:01] and encourage and lift up and and
[3:04] let us let us find a way to be a better
[3:06] soldier for the journey that's left out
[3:08] ahead of us lord we're always looking
[3:09] for that
[3:11] thank you for the the faithfulness of
[3:14] the people to see them out here on a
[3:16] on a wednesday night many of them
[3:18] probably work today and
[3:19] the frustrations of work so hard
[3:21] sometimes to roll that off and
[3:23] and enter into the word but we pray
[3:25] you'll help us for this little time
[3:26] together
[3:27] in her name amen amen god bless you may
[3:30] be seated
[3:32] i understand that y'all just began a new
[3:36] tradition around here of having the
[3:38] people stand while the preacher preached
[3:44] i don't know i
[3:48] i heard that i'm just saying actually i
[3:51] i was so intrigued by it i went back and
[3:53] watched today so i did see it
[3:55] i wanted to see how that was done you
[3:57] know
[3:59] i'm just gonna get rid of this
[4:03] but uh yeah it was but you know
[4:06] i'm gonna take up from my brother back
[4:08] then because that is actually the way
[4:11] it was done in jesus christ how many
[4:14] times did
[4:15] he sat down and the people stood up
[4:18] so as our brother dale gets older i
[4:20] expect to see a chair up here for him to
[4:22] sit down
[4:24] so he's just getting ready for the way
[4:26] it's going to be
[4:27] that's right jesus sat in the boat and
[4:29] the people stood on the shores
[4:32] that's all scriptural you did well my
[4:34] brother you did well
[4:36] but see we just get it messed up in our
[4:37] laodicean minds
[4:39] we want to relax most of us want to get
[4:42] on to sleep so we can be rested up for
[4:44] work tomorrow
[4:47] i've been out there i've been out there
[4:48] with you that's right
[4:51] but it is good to be with you i enjoyed
[4:53] hearing our brother
[4:54] that's some very good thoughts there he
[4:56] had a lot of them i will have to give
[4:57] him credit for that
[4:59] we have a lot of good things but i
[5:01] appreciate it getting
[5:03] whatever the lord's going to do through
[5:04] our brothers that's right all right
[5:06] amen we
[5:11] we really just have a a pass through
[5:13] this wednesday night i i
[5:15] always hate to invade a man's pulpit and
[5:17] wins we were just coming by and we had
[5:20] you know who was at our house a couple
[5:21] of weeks ago
[5:23] mostly this trip was payback for that
[5:26] so that i could stay in his house and
[5:29] and
[5:30] agonize him the way he antagonized us
[5:33] for a whole week out there but i was i
[5:36] was tempted to just take a little time
[5:38] to share with y'all how he acts when he
[5:39] gets on the road but i know he won't be
[5:41] able to handle that
[5:42] so we don't want to get into that too
[5:44] much but we did enjoy having brother
[5:45] wade out and
[5:47] he gets to stay at our house and
[5:50] so we appreciate our birthday all y'all
[5:53] all y'all that are here it's good
[5:55] good to be with you of course on
[5:56] wednesday we always want to go quickly
[5:58] because
[6:00] just because you never can get to the
[6:03] end the brothers ask me to handle quotes
[6:04] and i handed them enough for
[6:06] about three or four hours if we just
[6:08] went slow and so
[6:10] we'll get to as much as we can and we
[6:12] live in a funny
[6:14] a very uh unusual time i mean you know
[6:16] here how many
[6:18] would have known a few just what it
[6:19] wasn't monday this week we found out
[6:20] we're getting a new pope
[6:23] yeah he's going to resign on february
[6:25] 28th
[6:26] i don't know what that means i'm not a
[6:28] prophet or the son of a prophet and
[6:30] i know a lot of folks probably tonight
[6:32] in the pulpits they're speculating and
[6:35] postulating and formulating yeah
[6:38] and data layton you know setting some
[6:41] dates
[6:42] it is it is unique that he's resigning
[6:45] on the very
[6:46] 50-year anniversary of the cloud
[6:48] appearing right now right
[6:51] i don't know what that means it's just
[6:53] the way it is sorry you know
[6:55] and the lord will we'll make all that
[6:56] work out
[6:58] we coming up on the 50-year anniversary
[7:01] of the seals being opened
[7:04] and you know it's a it's a funny thing
[7:06] that that here we are 50 years later
[7:08] talking about that and there was people
[7:10] sitting in those meetings that week
[7:13] that the seals were being open and
[7:14] expecting brother
[7:16] when he preached that seventh seal right
[7:18] that it was going to end that day
[7:20] all right and here you and i are 50
[7:23] years later we're still
[7:24] talking about it right it makes it more
[7:26] wonderful than ever right
[7:28] right
[7:36] because i got a really dried out mouth
[7:39] so y'all just
[7:40] saved me from spitting on these guys if
[7:42] i keep sucking on that thing a little
[7:44] bit
[7:44] it's almost too fancy to use though you
[7:46] know but that's that's good
[7:48] thank you for whoever provided that
[7:51] yeah 50 years later we you know like i
[7:53] said people that were in those meetings
[7:56] brother you've heard the testimonies we
[8:01] thought when he opened that seventh seal
[8:04] it was going to be over that morning all
[8:05] right and here we are still worshiping
[8:07] around i don't care if it's another 50
[8:09] years i plan on still being there all
[8:10] right
[8:11] i'll be too old then to talk to you all
[8:12] about it but
[8:14] you know i'm not worried about it being
[8:17] 2013
[8:19] right not worried about it that's right
[8:21] about it you know
[8:22] all the dates we passed and yep right
[8:25] you know i said to a group the other day
[8:26] you know the quietest bunch around right
[8:28] now are the mayans you don't hear much
[8:29] out of them
[8:32] haven't had any mayans stopping you on
[8:33] the stream handing you out a track
[8:36] telling you it's all going to be over in
[8:37] 2012
[8:38] right i don't know
[8:41] harold camping he's also pretty quiet of
[8:43] course he died so
[8:44] that probably prohibited him picking
[8:47] another day but you know he picked a
[8:48] couple along the way
[8:49] that buses out all around the world and
[8:51] they were
[8:52] they were coming to an end and and then
[8:55] we had the mayans and
[8:56] there was a lot of a lot of people
[8:59] put a lot of stock in that mayan thing
[9:03] the mayan calendar i don't know who
[9:05] could read a mayan calendar anyway
[9:06] y'all ever seen y'all see pictures of it
[9:08] on the internet the internet people
[9:09] probably do a round disc with all these
[9:12] engravings on it and i like that
[9:16] that cartoon that was on there the best
[9:18] they had a mayan calendar there around
[9:20] this and had an oreo cookie over here
[9:21] beside
[9:22] of it yeah right and underneath it it
[9:25] said the mayans tell you
[9:27] that it's all going to be over in 2012
[9:29] but the oreo cookie says you're okay you
[9:31] know
[9:33] one's about as valuable as the other
[9:35] exactly it was funny but it was
[9:37] quite true and if you looked at them
[9:40] they both looked about the same they
[9:41] both had engravings on them and they
[9:42] both had
[9:44] one of them probably said nabisco and i
[9:45] don't know what the other one said
[9:49] but those guys are quiet now but it uh
[9:52] it doesn't matter how many more come and
[9:54] go
[9:55] hollywood got people excited about 2012
[9:58] and they made that movie in the
[10:00] earth breaking up and asteroids and
[10:02] meteors and
[10:04] and all of those things going on but we
[10:06] just ain't really
[10:07] too bothered about what day it is
[10:10] enrollment calendar
[10:12] the calendar so goofed up from all the
[10:15] years of
[10:16] adding and subtracting multiplying and
[10:17] dividing we hardly know what the real
[10:19] calendar is anyway
[10:20] i like brother brown's philosophy we
[10:22] need to just live today
[10:23] right glory like tomorrow could be the
[10:26] last
[10:26] amendment right and then
[10:30] whenever it is we're just ready right
[10:31] it's just staying on ready
[10:33] right amen and so tonight we're gonna
[10:35] we're gonna look at a little simple
[10:36] thought coming through on a quick
[10:37] wednesday night like this so we're not
[10:39] gonna get into
[10:40] into too much heavy and and and
[10:43] deep-minded stuff but let's just look at
[10:45] what brother branham said about these
[10:46] verses he in the oncoming storm and i
[10:49] gave the brothers these quotes i don't
[10:51] know if they're in any kind of order
[10:52] that they can
[10:53] can help put them up there but this is
[10:55] in the message of the oncoming storm
[10:56] brother branham has just read these
[10:58] verses
[11:00] and he said this jesus was speaking here
[11:03] of a coming storm
[11:05] which has got to strike every man and
[11:08] every woman that's born in the world
[11:10] there is just no way out of it right
[11:13] man that's a promising wednesday night
[11:15] it's tight topic right
[11:17] the oncoming storm that storm will
[11:20] strike you sometime or another
[11:22] and it depends on what kind of a
[11:24] foundation that you have right
[11:26] whether your house will weather it or
[11:28] not that's right there's been many lives
[11:30] saved because of preparation for storms
[11:33] there's been many of life's lost because
[11:35] of failing to take heed
[11:37] to the warning of storms that's coming
[11:40] we might come back to that in a few
[11:41] minutes
[11:42] but that just sets the tone for what
[11:43] we're going to look at tonight
[11:45] jesus was speaking of a coming storm
[11:48] which has got to strike every man and
[11:51] every woman that's born in the world
[11:54] i believe brothers and sisters that we
[11:56] have the the antidote for that storm
[11:59] here in front of us let me just say that
[12:01] that's the end of the message but that's
[12:02] that's all i'm going to
[12:03] think about throughout it there's a
[12:06] quote i wanted to read to you
[12:07] christ is revealed in his own word
[12:11] and and it was it was very very struck
[12:14] my heart very special
[12:15] in this area and and i trust it'll be a
[12:18] blessing to you this is in 1965.
[12:21] brother branham is beginning his text
[12:24] he says now my text this morning is
[12:27] christ is revealed in his own word now
[12:30] where i come to the conclusion to talk
[12:33] on that
[12:34] on this was because that knowing that
[12:36] what we say
[12:38] we mustn't just say because we're
[12:40] gathered together to just haphazardly
[12:42] speak on anything
[12:44] but it's something that will help
[12:46] stabilize the people right yeah
[12:48] if every preacher would come to the
[12:50] pulpit with that in his heart in mind
[12:53] we'd have a whole lot better services
[12:57] i get to visit a lot of churches i get
[12:58] to sit in a lot of meetings i don't
[13:00] always preach when i go out to service i
[13:02] could have
[13:02] blown in here on wednesday night and sat
[13:04] and listened it would have been it would
[13:05] have been just fine and i do get to hear
[13:07] a lot of different preachers
[13:09] i go on the internet and i try to keep
[13:11] up with not because i'm nosy but that's
[13:13] 50
[13:14] of it the other 50 percent maybe 60
[13:18] some nights when i'm feeling really nosy
[13:20] it's 75 percent of it but
[13:23] but i do like to see what brothers are
[13:25] looking at
[13:26] and i don't want to be critical of men
[13:28] of my own profession you know it's like
[13:30] one
[13:31] car salesman criticizing another you're
[13:32] both in the same thing
[13:34] you know i mean you're both doing the
[13:35] same job right and i don't want to be
[13:37] critical of ministry but
[13:39] but my goodness brothers and sisters as
[13:41] long as i listen to some of these men
[13:44] preach and i wonder if they've ever even
[13:47] listened to a tape
[13:48] right or read the books or studied the
[13:51] message right
[13:52] i'm embarrassed for men that i know that
[13:55] have been ministering for years
[13:57] can't just just can't read it off of the
[14:01] page and get the revelations what
[14:02] brother brown was trying to tell them
[14:04] now their argument might be well that's
[14:05] your revelation and this is mine and
[14:08] but you can tell you can tell the
[14:11] difference in a man
[14:13] that that that is not applying himself
[14:16] to the word right right
[14:18] and brother dale and i were talking
[14:20] about it a bit last night you know you
[14:22] sit and you talk to people and
[14:24] and you hear brother branham said and he
[14:26] didn't say that at all it's just what
[14:28] they
[14:29] a lot of times they're repeating what
[14:30] they've heard that he said
[14:32] right and they don't take time to go
[14:34] back into the message themselves and
[14:36] and it is an embarrassment again i don't
[14:38] want to be be critical of people of my
[14:40] own profession but there are some
[14:41] horrible
[14:43] man this may sound awful there's some
[14:46] really
[14:46] bad preachers out there is that is that
[14:49] too cruel
[14:50] i don't know they say they're called but
[14:53] our brother said more last night than
[14:55] that a basket full of them have said in
[14:57] the last six months right yeah right
[14:59] and i i'm not interested to pinpoint
[15:00] them you'll run across them soon or
[15:02] another and that's why
[15:03] or hopefully you won't hopefully that
[15:07] won't be the case
[15:08] right but this is what brother branham
[15:10] says we don't want to gather
[15:11] back to that quote we don't want to
[15:12] gather just because we're gathered and
[15:15] just haphazardly speak on anything
[15:18] right but we want to say something that
[15:20] will help stabilize the people
[15:24] that's what a lot of them don't have in
[15:26] their heart they come in with a doctrine
[15:27] or they come in with a
[15:28] a personal little revelation and they
[15:32] want to say something that
[15:33] doesn't stabilize the people but messes
[15:35] their minds up
[15:36] right right where's the motivation
[15:39] behind that
[15:40] from right that's right oh my he says
[15:43] they need to stabilize the people
[15:45] because we're going to pass through
[15:47] dangerous treacherous waters we're
[15:50] already sailing through them
[15:52] right and sometimes and this is an
[15:54] honest confession from brother branham
[15:56] and sometimes i guess it's with you like
[15:58] it is with me
[16:00] it seems like so much of it is such a
[16:02] scary
[16:03] yeah it's such a scary that's what
[16:05] that's what he's saying it's just such a
[16:06] scary
[16:07] right time he goes on have they got that
[16:11] quote up
[16:11] are you finding that one back there
[16:13] because i wanted you to read this one
[16:15] with me there we go paragraph 18 there
[16:19] i was just talking to a young minister
[16:21] and his wife in the room
[16:23] just a few moments ago and both of them
[16:25] are nervous
[16:27] just like the rest of the world rest of
[16:29] the human beings on earth
[16:31] and i said remember satan's got a punch
[16:34] coming at you
[16:36] i don't care who you are he's got a
[16:38] right and this is
[16:39] we don't appreciate this but if we was
[16:41] born with it right
[16:43] we was born with satan's right on us is
[16:45] that right i mean
[16:46] he was right he was our first he was
[16:49] first in line
[16:50] right remember satan's got a punch
[16:52] coming at you don't care who you are
[16:53] he's got a right for that one punch
[16:57] which should you rather be that punch be
[16:59] blind or being arthritic sitting in a
[17:01] chair
[17:02] or be nervous see he's got somewhere he
[17:05] can punch you right
[17:07] he's got a right to that open place now
[17:09] that's the spot you got to keep covered
[17:12] all the time
[17:13] and to see this nervous age that we're
[17:15] living in that's right amen
[17:17] i think brother branham is looking at
[17:18] the body as a whole the group
[17:20] as a whole and he's saying if there's
[17:22] one spot that he hits the most of us
[17:25] at it's nerves every one of us has got
[17:28] him
[17:29] if you ain't got no nerves you've got
[17:32] them
[17:33] maybe it just hasn't been hit in the
[17:34] right spot yet but we're all nervous
[17:36] that's right we were talking about a
[17:38] little bit in our fellowship last night
[17:40] how many
[17:40] prayer lines you would listen to brother
[17:42] branham as the women you know as they
[17:44] reach that time of life and they would
[17:46] they would come at the up in the prayer
[17:47] line thinking something was wrong with
[17:49] them
[17:50] and you go back and listen to those
[17:52] cases and and the sister would come and
[17:54] and he'd say oh he brother i remember
[17:56] very clearly he said oh sister he says
[17:58] he said that's just he said that's just
[18:01] that's just human nature that's just you
[18:03] going through the change of life
[18:05] he said if i ask half of the women out
[18:07] here that's your age they can all raise
[18:09] their hand and say they got the same
[18:10] thing he says
[18:11] that nervousness is right he's just born
[18:14] in it now i know it affects some
[18:15] women worse than others and easier than
[18:18] others and
[18:18] i've heard women believe me these are
[18:21] conversations we all run
[18:22] from right but i know the sisters get
[18:24] together they compare notes
[18:27] we don't care about that that's y'all's
[18:29] information we are okay
[18:30] all right brother wants in on that i i
[18:33] don't understand
[18:36] but i know if you're young you sisters
[18:39] haven't reached there yet
[18:40] ask some of the older ones they have
[18:41] lots of notes taken for you along the
[18:43] way
[18:44] i remember this and i remember that and
[18:46] brother branham wasn't making little of
[18:48] that he was just recognizing it's a
[18:50] human condition
[18:52] that's a human condition and they're
[18:54] thinking something is bad wrong with
[18:56] them and it's just a human condition
[18:58] right and the lord has helped for that
[19:01] there
[19:02] certainly we understand there's severe
[19:04] cases and mild cases and
[19:06] and all of those things but but it's
[19:08] just he said
[19:09] maybe it's with you like it is with me
[19:11] we're just in a nervous time
[19:13] right just a nervous time and satan's
[19:16] got a punch come at you would you rather
[19:18] be something else
[19:19] right that's right come on bro you see
[19:21] his question that's what he's asking you
[19:23] would you rather
[19:24] be blindness would you rather be you're
[19:25] sitting there through to get a chair or
[19:27] just be nervous what you're gonna take
[19:28] i'll take the nerves and i'll take the
[19:30] grace that comes right
[19:32] for a nervous condition
[19:35] but don't you see here's what brother
[19:37] branham is telling us
[19:38] when we look into the word there is help
[19:40] from the word for this era
[19:43] there is help from the word if a
[19:45] minister comes to the pulpit with the
[19:47] right
[19:48] heart with the right attitude not just
[19:51] haphazardly speaking on anything but he
[19:53] wants to find
[19:54] something that'll stabilize the people
[19:57] right
[19:58] sure you know i wish there was a magic
[20:00] wand or a magic sermon that i know
[20:02] brother dale probably would like to have
[20:04] one that he could just wave over the
[20:05] congregation
[20:06] and you are stabilized forever
[20:10] how many know stabilization is a
[20:12] continuing process
[20:14] because it's an oncoming storm it's
[20:16] waves crashing into
[20:17] it and you may be able to better one and
[20:20] then tomorrow there's a different one
[20:23] but brother branham looks at these
[20:25] quotes he begins to look at this
[20:27] and he recognizes that somewhere in our
[20:30] lives there's a big punch coming he's
[20:32] got one
[20:33] how many believe that i don't know if
[20:35] you can stop and look back in your life
[20:37] and say i remember when that one came
[20:39] right if you've lived through it i
[20:42] wouldn't get too comfortable because
[20:43] right right because knowing the walls of
[20:47] the enemy right yeah
[20:48] he will try to duplicate it so you can
[20:50] the good thing is after you come through
[20:52] it you know how to fight the battle yeah
[20:54] and the lord keeps giving us strength
[20:56] that's right but that's what he says
[20:57] remember
[20:58] satan's got a punch a punch i just call
[21:01] this message
[21:02] the last punch the last punch here's
[21:05] another quote that i wanted to add to
[21:06] this
[21:07] and you'll see where our thought is
[21:08] coming from it's in the unwelcome christ
[21:11] back in 1955 brother branham is is
[21:14] actually praying before he gets
[21:16] in into the message there
[21:20] our brothers can find that one forces in
[21:22] 1955
[21:26] starting right there we're thankful this
[21:28] morning lord
[21:30] that you put with us the eye of the
[21:32] eagle the holy spirit that looks far off

[22:04] living in this great marvelous day now
[22:06] preaching the gospel
[22:08] and knowing this look as he goes on he's
[22:11] praying now knowing this
[22:12] that satan is making his last punch at
[22:15] the church
[22:17] he will never be able to do it after
[22:19] this age she will be
[22:21] safely under the wings of her lover
[22:23] after this time
[22:24] and we realize that he's impersonating
[22:27] in the way of religion
[22:28] he's doing all kinds of the things and
[22:30] the bible said he'd be like a roaring
[22:32] lion devoured what he would
[22:34] he'd be so shrewd and cunning that he
[22:36] would deceive the very elect
[22:38] if possible amen and he puts it in
[22:40] brackets and brackets there if possible
[22:43] what does that mean it's impossible
[22:45] right it's not possible that the elect
[22:48] will be deceived but oh lord
[22:50] thou art the protection of those who
[22:51] flee to that bosom for a refuge
[22:54] and here we come in jesus name receive
[22:56] us lord amen
[22:57] he says i'm grateful we're thankful lord
[22:59] that you've given us an
[23:01] eye that when the storms of life are
[23:03] raging
[23:04] we can look over there and guess what
[23:06] you got right standing by me
[23:09] when the when our friends of me have
[23:11] left us and our foes have
[23:13] y'all sing that song here stand on me
[23:15] what a wonderful song
[23:16] right when the storms of life are raging
[23:19] stand by me
[23:21] stand by me over and over and repeat
[23:23] that this is what
[23:24] our prophet is telling us we're glad
[23:27] that you've given us a vision
[23:29] a vision beyond the the mess that's
[23:32] going on today
[23:33] beyond the troubles that we have today
[23:36] you know we when we sit together as
[23:38] brothers and we were sitting just having
[23:40] some fellowship last night with brother
[23:41] wade

[23:45] began to pile up all the scarecrows
[23:47] along the way
[23:47] right oh my goodness we had a big pile
[23:51] in just a very short time
[23:56] oh my god that's even hard for me to say
[23:58] because there was men
[24:00] broken on that pile of scarecrows they
[24:02] were my friends
[24:04] there's brothers piled up in that pile
[24:07] of scarecrows that just needs to be
[24:08] burned and forgotten about
[24:09] right that are shipwrecked some of them
[24:12] are dead and gone some of them are still
[24:13] living
[24:14] coming out with doctrines that lead them
[24:16] into filth and defilement right
[24:19] and yet and yet somehow looking at that
[24:23] pile of scarecrows and brotherhood so
[24:24] that's what the devil will always try to
[24:26] get you to do
[24:27] he'll try to get you to look at some
[24:28] shipwreck along the way and say look
[24:30] they shipwrecked
[24:31] what hope do you have right but i have
[24:34] hope and that's the only thing we're

[24:37] oh yeah we can make a pile don't glory
[24:40] in the in the beat down that you got
[24:41] once upon your life let me just say that
[24:43] i've had them
[24:44] i've worked with a man for seven or
[24:46] eight years as his associate here
[24:48] he told me in the very end as i was on
[24:50] my way out the door
[24:52] he said the only mistake you ever made
[24:54] was thinking that i needed you here
[24:56] oh man i wish you'd told me that seven
[24:58] years ago when
[25:02] sure don't let the disappointments
[25:07] i know a lot of brothers friends of mine
[25:09] when you get with them all they want to
[25:11] talk about is how badly they were abused
[25:13] in some other church one time or another
[25:15] yeah leaving those things that are
[25:17] behind when you press forward
[25:19] right don't hang on to those shipwrecks
[25:21] a long way
[25:22] amen don't revel and rejoice over and
[25:25] over even though you say it's
[25:26] it's it's just it's not but it is it's
[25:29] there's some value that you're seeing
[25:31] and knowing that you were once
[25:32] abused and scarred and and mistreated
[25:36] and called names
[25:38] given up forgetting those things
[25:42] we've all got them we've all had pastors
[25:44] that didn't do us right right
[25:46] we've all had churches that didn't do us
[25:48] right yeah
[25:49] oh it's it's easy but don't let that
[25:51] hinder you don't let that bother you now
[25:53] amen satan is making his last punch at
[25:56] the church if we could if we could throw
[25:57] our shoulders back
[25:59] tonight when we're done and say we've
[26:01] got something to rejoice about this is
[26:03] the last group that right
[26:06] that's what brother brown said satan is
[26:08] making his last punches to the church
[26:10] he'll never be able to do it after this
[26:13] age right right
[26:14] don't you see what a wonderful age god
[26:15] let us live all right
[26:17] that's right we're taking the last hits
[26:20] and you know why he's not gonna have
[26:21] anybody else to hit again is because
[26:23] we're going to overcome it
[26:24] and walk out and be changed in a moment
[26:27] in the twinkling of an eye
[26:29] amen he will be defeated by what our
[26:31] change
[26:32] right amen satan will be defeated by a
[26:35] group of people
[26:36] that brother branham said as she nears
[26:38] him she will be so much like him
[26:40] right she'll be in his very image glory
[26:43] that's the defeat of the enemies
[26:45] what's what is it over in the millennium
[26:46] when he he had what did brother graham
[26:48] say the reason he can't cause any
[26:49] trouble anymore right he has nobody to
[26:51] work on
[26:52] all right we're getting there brothers
[26:54] and sisters
[26:55] we got there yet
[26:58] we got there yet yeah right
[27:02] you know i can kick brother wade hard
[27:03] enough in the shins he's finally going
[27:05] to get mad at me
[27:06] but that won't be he only takes one lick
[27:08] he says
[27:10] see it can happen
[27:15] we're in a glorious time amen i believe
[27:17] brothers and sisters
[27:19] when this bride overcomes
[27:22] when that when when the scripture is
[27:24] finally fulfilled
[27:26] we which are alive and remain will not
[27:29] prevent or hinder
[27:30] them that you are asleep amen but we'll
[27:33] all be
[27:33] we'll be changed in a moment in the
[27:35] trackling overnight don't you realize
[27:37] satan is defeated amen uh us waving
[27:40] goodbye is his last defeat because
[27:42] there's nobody left to work
[27:44] on it amen that's why brother brown says
[27:46] satan is making his
[27:48] last punch at the church he'll never be
[27:50] able to do it after this age
[27:53] that's why we say don't don't worry
[27:55] about writing a book of acts behind this
[27:57] church
[27:58] why because there ain't going to be
[27:59] nobody there to read it this is it we're
[28:02] us
[28:03] for us right and i know what you're
[28:05] sitting back at this
[28:06] while ago you said 50 years ago we
[28:07] thought it was us i don't care
[28:09] if it's not me brother branham talked
[28:11] enough about enoch
[28:13] and he said he said i may not have faith
[28:16] to go like him
[28:17] but somebody will just don't let me get
[28:20] in their way
[28:20] don't let me hand her down right now
[28:22] because somebody it becometh us to
[28:24] fulfill all right
[28:27] it becometh us to fulfill this word
[28:30] and be that elect lady yes that is going
[28:33] to be
[28:33] changed that's right oh man we're taking
[28:35] the last hit

[28:53] you guys at the bow hunt
[28:54] i mean you ever get with just a boat
[28:56] yeah yeah
[28:57] come on no none right because why he's
[29:00] got no weapon
[29:01] right right that's why the scripture
[29:03] says no weapon that he forms against the
[29:05] ship
[29:08] i was reading some old football player
[29:10] the one the super bowl was using that as
[29:11] his quote man leave that alone
[29:14] yeah like

[29:19] talking about football we're talking
[29:21] about warfare
[29:22] hey man all right i don't mean to get i
[29:25] did get disgusted at that no weapon for
[29:27] him against this shall prosper
[29:28] yeah he's talking about another football
[29:30] team that's not why that scripture is
[29:32] right
[29:33] that's nuts for us that's right satan is
[29:37] making his last punch at the church
[29:39] he'll never be able to do it after this
[29:42] age this is the last punch
[29:44] over in revelations 12 just quickly look
[29:46] at that it's worth reading i want you to
[29:48] read
[29:49] read that that revelation you know this
[29:52] verse very well it's an end time verse
[29:55] talking about war in heaven verse
[29:58] chapter 12 verse 7 there was war in
[30:00] heaven
[30:01] michael and his angels fought against
[30:03] the dragon and the dragon fought and his
[30:05] angels
[30:06] and prevail not neither was their place
[30:08] found anymore in heaven
[30:09] that the great dragon was cast out that
[30:11] old serpent
[30:12] called the devil and satan which
[30:14] deceiveth the whole world
[30:16] he was cast out into the earth and his
[30:18] angels were cast out with him and i
[30:19] heard a loud voice saying and heaven now
[30:21] has come salvation
[30:22] and strength in the kingdom of our god
[30:24] in the power of his christ
[30:26] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[30:28] down which accused him before our god
[30:31] they and they overcame him they overcame
[30:34] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[30:36] word of their testimony they love not
[30:37] their lives unto the death
[30:39] therefore rejoice ye heavens and you
[30:41] that dwell in them what are the
[30:42] inhabitants of the earth and of the sea
[30:44] for the devil has come down unto you
[30:46] having great wrath
[30:48] having great wrath because he knoweth
[30:50] what
[30:51] that he had about a short time exactly
[30:54] come on there's a great wrath time going
[30:57] on he's got his last punch coming at us
[30:59] right and the book of revelation sums it
[31:01] up as great wrath
[31:03] all right you know why he's so angry
[31:04] because he ain't got much time left
[31:06] right right there and because there's
[31:08] somebody here that can take that blow
[31:11] there's somebody on the scene that can
[31:13] take that gift
[31:15] that can take that punch
[31:20] brothers and sisters some of them are
[31:22] sitting in this building tonight
[31:24] that elect lady that can take that kind
[31:26] of a blog
[31:27] that can take that time of great wrath
[31:30] right amen
[31:31] i'm not fall all right she's sitting
[31:34] here tonight
[31:35] man that's why you've been called to
[31:36] this word it's not because we're
[31:39] of anything in ourselves it's because
[31:41] this word has fortified us
[31:42] yes it's because of this foreign
[31:46] but oh it's a nervous age it's a weak
[31:48] age it amazes me sometimes what
[31:50] what trips people up do you ever you get
[31:53] amazed
[31:54] you hear people falling away because of
[31:57] some
[31:57] little minor insignificant don't amount

[32:07] church no more because and it's the
[32:09] weakest

[32:38] they will be those that can
[32:42] will but those that cannot cannot
[32:44] everybody
[32:45] would deceive the very elect but you
[32:47] know what he cannot deceive the very
[32:48] like

[35:56] pack what do you think
[35:58] this woman her power and you see right
[36:02] now where they're going to take all the
[36:03] people that's got odd ideas about
[36:06] religion
[36:07] and send them to alaska
[36:12] right just go and pack our bags yeah i
[36:14] don't know if we all get to make the
[36:16] trip
[36:17] somebody undoubtedly is heading to
[36:19] alaska that's all i want to say about
[36:20] that
[36:21] that is not a mental squeeze that's
[36:23] right
[36:25] all i want to say to you the squeeze is
[36:28] the final fulfillment of this time of
[36:30] great wrath right right
[36:33] and it's not the enemy coming against
[36:35] you because you're you it's the enemy
[36:36] coming against the word right
[36:39] the squeeze is a move against the word
[36:41] it's not a move against wade and tom
[36:44] and terence and brother sam and our
[36:47] brother donnie over there the squeezing
[36:49] doesn't affect him because his brother
[36:51] donnie it's going to affect him because
[36:52] he's part
[36:54] it's not a personal onslaught of the
[36:56] enemy it's a move against the word
[36:58] right and all those who have been united
[37:01] with the word
[37:02] cannot unite themselves right with that
[37:05] spirit that's right
[37:06] over and over and over over and over
[37:08] brother adam lets us know
[37:10] i don't know when they're going to close
[37:11] it up and make it a storehouse i don't
[37:13] know
[37:14] if it's going to happen in every message
[37:15] church or some messenger right
[37:17] i don't know if all message believers
[37:19] get to go to alaska right back
[37:24] and christ the mystery of god revealed
[37:25] they're going to bring a persecution on
[37:27] pretty soon and shut up all the churches
[37:30] and churches like this who's not a
[37:31] denomination they'll use them for a
[37:33] storehouse
[37:34] and anything and if any man goes and
[37:36] offer a prayer for anybody else that
[37:38] don't belong to the economic
[37:39] economical movement will be shot on the
[37:42] spot right
[37:43] how is that a mental squeeze come on
[37:47] brothers and sisters exactly
[37:49] i don't know how bad nobody wants to
[37:52] talk about that right
[37:53] nobody wants to look forward to this day
[37:56] over and over brother branham keeps
[37:57] going through these things thing
[37:59] but there's one thing about it over and
[38:01] over you'll find
[38:02] there's a man here that can turn on the
[38:04] light when the persecution comes
[38:06] what's his advice don't get scared
[38:10] don't get scared there's a light he said
[38:12] he would catch his people away
[38:14] she'll not go through the tribulation
[38:16] she'll never do it and he said she
[38:18] wouldn't she'll be caught away
[38:20] right how are they gonna do it brother
[38:21] branham it looks awful dark no matter
[38:23] how dark it gets right if you can't see
[38:25] your hand before you
[38:26] just remember there's a man here that
[38:28] can hurt all right
[38:30] he will rapture i don't know how much of
[38:33] it we're going to see
[38:35] i hope i don't see none right i hope all
[38:37] of those quotes are just for y'all and
[38:39] he'll leave me alone
[38:41] i really do i'm sorry
[38:55] brother let me tell you something you
[38:56] better sure get christ in your heart
[38:58] right because there's coming a time
[39:00] where you're really going to need it
[39:02] right exactly
[39:05] it looks like they're going to force us
[39:06] everyone you got to come in or they're
[39:09] going to close you up
[39:10] right and you know what's going to
[39:11] happen while we're not a denomination
[39:13] you know what's going to happen to a
[39:14] little group like this
[39:17] does this sound like a mental squeeze
[39:19] you're going to pay for it boys
[39:21] that's exactly right
[39:25] we're going to go out with a it's the
[39:27] last punch it's the final stage of that
[39:30] final punch
[39:31] that satan has on the church my brother
[39:33] ran him over and over
[39:35] over and over as he went through these
[39:36] quotes he mentions this several times
[39:38] watch that third full man amen watch
[39:48] that's why we don't have to be scared
[39:50] because we believe
[39:52] right i believe the true report
[39:55] believe when that final punch comes down
[39:58] when that great wrath of satan
[40:00] takes its turn and ever how it manifests
[40:02] right man
[40:03] there's a man here that can turn on the
[40:04] light after a short and powerful
[40:07] demonstration of the spirit this little
[40:09] hunted and persecuted group
[40:10] right we'll go to be with jesus that's
[40:13] right
[40:14] oh my we'll be able to weather it
[40:16] brothers and sisters all right
[40:17] i know one time i was talking about the
[40:19] squeeze a man came up mad at me because
[40:21] we've even talked about i don't want to
[40:22] think about that
[40:23] well don't think about it right but i
[40:25] believe it prepares us
[40:28] a stack of them here over and over
[40:30] preparing us
[40:31] right preparing us now getting us ready
[40:34] right for that last punch that's coming
[40:36] our way
[40:37] i'm still glad knowing how dark it looks
[40:39] out there knowing how drew i'm still
[40:41] glad
[40:41] right to be the one that can take that
[40:43] last punch
[40:45] i'm glad to be in a body that's going to
[40:47] be changed and the punch won't hurt
[40:49] that's what i'm looking for glory he's
[40:52] preparing us for it now he's
[40:54] ready for it now that's right let me
[40:55] read you another quote in possessing the
[40:57] enemy's gates
[41:00] maybe they'll find this one if they're
[41:02] 59 1108 possession
[41:04] i like this quote
[41:09] god's getting us ready for that fight
[41:12] he's building up soldiers he's building
[41:14] up shoulders
[41:17] it was moses after being also in the
[41:20] line of this royal seat of abraham that
[41:22] when he was sent down into egypt
[41:24] to deliver the children of israel god
[41:26] had given signs and wonders to perform
[41:28] to smite the earth to bring forth frogs
[41:30] and fleas and darkness and hail
[41:32] and rain and fire and he'd done all
[41:34] these miracles yet when he led them out
[41:35] by the hand of jehovah there'd come a
[41:37] time
[41:38] when he met the gate between him and the
[41:39] promised land and there was the red sea
[41:41] a bar across the way they were hemmed in
[41:43] by pharaoh's army
[41:45] mountains and deserts in the red sea but
[41:47] moses stepped forward
[41:48] and possessed the gate of his emmy
[41:50] across the red sea dry shot as he was
[41:52] walking on a dusty road
[41:54] you shall possess the gate of the enemy
[41:56] i like that picture you put up there
[41:58] right there the other night about the
[41:59] crossing of the red sea i don't know
[42:01] where he got there was
[42:02] it was just an awful narrow line it's
[42:03] going to take two million people a long
[42:05] time to get across
[42:06] right now but then chariots wouldn't
[42:07] make catch them it didn't matter how
[42:09] long
[42:10] i was envisioned just a little wider way
[42:11] but that's okay that was alright
[42:13] that was a good picture anyway i
[42:15] appreciate that
[42:17] you shall put god said so but it was
[42:20] yeah they come out under a great victory
[42:22] but it was a few years later when the
[42:23] trials come
[42:25] and the church got all shook up and look
[42:28] what brethren
[42:29] said it is so easy for a congregation of
[42:32] people to do when something
[42:34] just don't seem to happen the way that
[42:36] it's supposed to be
[42:38] what's brother it's easy for a church to
[42:40] get sugar but things don't just seem to
[42:41] happen the way that it's supposed to be
[42:43] god makes
[42:44] it that way amen god brings tensions
[42:46] into the church for every son that
[42:48] cometh to god must be tried
[42:50] and proven right and tested he let
[42:52] sickness strike you
[42:55] he lets diseases come on you to test you
[42:57] and approve you
[42:58] to show the world that you're truly the
[43:00] seed of abraham
[43:01] he permits it by his own will amen he
[43:04] permits
[43:05] disasters he permits the friends to turn
[43:08] against you
[43:09] he permits all these things and turns
[43:11] the devil loose to tempt you
[43:13] and he'll do all but take your life he
[43:15] could throw you on a bit of affliction
[43:18] he could turn your neighbors against you
[43:20] he could turn the church against you
[43:22] he can do most anything and it's god's
[43:24] will for him to do it
[43:26] amen we are taught that it is more
[43:27] precious
[43:29] than goldfest that's right oh my
[43:32] brothers and sisters i know what you're
[43:34] thinking i don't care if the neighbors
[43:35] don't think much of me
[43:37] he can turn the neighbors against you he
[43:40] can turn the church against you
[43:43] and it's god's will for that man but all
[43:46] we just
[43:47] if you're like me you just want to cry
[43:48] for a little while get that out of your
[43:50] system right
[43:51] come on god can't help you through all
[43:53] them tears
[43:55] stand up he's making a soldier out of
[43:57] him he permits
[43:58] these things right he permits disasters
[44:00] he permits friends
[44:02] he permits the devil to turn loose on
[44:04] you he can throw you on how many of us
[44:06] have symptoms
[44:08] through these all these we've felt them
[44:10] we felt them our friends have turned
[44:12] against us our neighbors
[44:14] what about abraham with isaac on the
[44:16] mountain the one that
[44:17] his the promise was given and by his
[44:19] loyalty and knowing his faith in jehovah
[44:21] it's through that and that alone that
[44:23] god looked down and said his seed shall
[44:24] possess again
[44:26] i've sworn by myself and i'll do these
[44:28] things there's no greater thing he could
[44:30] swear by
[44:31] but he swore by himself then if he let
[44:32] abraham be tested at that final point
[44:35] he's got to test you and me
[44:37] in that final moment right that time of
[44:39] decision you know what he's talking
[44:40] about is when he asked abraham after
[44:42] giving him the promised son
[44:43] right he asked him to go up there and
[44:45] offer him up on the mountain
[44:47] brother brown in one place call that a
[44:49] double test right
[44:50] talk about a test this was a double test
[44:53] here is your heir you waited all these
[44:55] years to get him and now i want you to
[44:57] give him back to you right
[44:58] right and abraham passed that double
[45:00] test that's why he was making a soldier
[45:01] out of him
[45:02] he was building him up he was preparing
[45:05] him for life last night
[45:07] brothers and sisters i believe god is
[45:09] taking our little
[45:10] battles and our little skirmishes and
[45:12] our little fights and our little
[45:14] disappointments and our little focuses
[45:16] that we get into along the way right
[45:18] and he's building an army he's building
[45:21] a body that when that time
[45:22] comes when that big punch comes your way
[45:26] when that final strike of the enemy
[45:28] comes our way in the form of a squeeze
[45:31] watch that third pull down he's got a
[45:33] people preparing
[45:35] that is watching it moving their lives
[45:37] now
[45:38] amen he says what we've seen temporarily
[45:40] now you're going to see it manifest
[45:43] in its fullness i don't mean we just sit
[45:45] around and wait on something that's
[45:46] happening now
[45:47] all right he is preparing us now that's
[45:50] right
[45:52] i had to bring this party i was reading
[45:54] today and it just it just so fit the
[45:56] sermon so well i added it to
[45:58] some of these thoughts i like what
[46:01] brother brandon said here it's in a
[46:02] message called presuming
[46:04] presuming i may remember a man that he
[46:06] talked about that he trained in boxing
[46:08] with six seconds smith yeah
[46:10] you mean i love this quote you remember
[46:12] six seconds smith yeah this is
[46:13] unpresuming when i first started
[46:15] training for boxing
[46:17] before i got in professional fighting
[46:18] there used to be a trainer called him
[46:20] six seconds smith
[46:22] the first professional fight he had he
[46:24] whipped the man in six seconds
[46:26] well that's a good nickname if you can
[46:28] do that right and when i started
[46:30] training that man
[46:31] liked to kill me he had knocked me plum
[46:34] out of the ring and everything else and
[46:36] i was skipping ropes and running seven
[46:38] eight miles every day
[46:40] and taking all the training and i said
[46:42] six
[46:43] why do you have to do me that way see i
[46:46] said you just
[46:47] knocked the breath out of me man i went
[46:49] plumb over four ropes come right out of
[46:51] there in amongst some chairs and like to
[46:53] broke my back on them
[46:55] and he laughed and said that'll do you
[46:57] good oh
[46:58] sure brother was thinking good yeah in
[47:01] fact i said do me good how can it do me
[47:03] good you're about to kill me
[47:06] and he said look billy i don't care how
[47:08] physically fit you arm
[47:09] your body's got to be able to stand that
[47:11] and come back right quick right
[47:13] if you take a hard punch said if your
[47:15] body's not used to coming back
[47:17] you'll lay there and take the count yeah
[47:19] but if your body's used to taking it
[47:22] and then coming back every time you hit
[47:24] it that shocks the blood
[47:26] runs it back to the heart but said if
[47:28] you do that said then your body's used
[47:30] to coming back quick
[47:32] when you get knocked down brother snaps
[47:34] his fingers you're on your feet again
[47:36] see that don't mean a thing when you get
[47:38] knocked down you're up on your feet
[47:40] again
[47:40] quick said you hate me now but you'll
[47:42] appreciate me
[47:44] when you get out there in the rain that
[47:46] was right
[47:48] a lesson from six seconds smith you've
[47:51] got to be
[47:52] conditioned right conditioning is what
[47:55] we're going through now
[47:57] we have our pressures in this life now
[48:00] and we see the hand of god we hear the
[48:02] testimonies i had a pain and god
[48:04] delivered me all right
[48:05] i know everybody's saying well everybody
[48:07] has pains but maybe
[48:08] you just want to live with yours this
[48:10] brother wanted to be delivered
[48:12] so it became god's provided way and god
[48:14] proved that for
[48:15] what about one of these days when it's a
[48:17] harder pain and he needs that same god
[48:19] it's because he's already proven the
[48:21] word amen prove me and see
[48:25] this is what brother branham is telling
[48:26] us he says you might hate me now but
[48:28] you're going to appreciate it one of
[48:30] these days
[48:30] when that hits coming down right when
[48:32] that last punch is coming your way
[48:35] you're going to appreciate that god has
[48:36] showed you right how to be a real
[48:38] soldier how to get back up
[48:40] and not just lay down there foreign i
[48:43] believe brothers and sisters
[48:45] i believe i believe
[48:48] this body this bride this elect lady
[48:51] is gonna have what it takes to stand
[48:53] until the end
[48:55] it may not be me i want to take brother
[48:56] branham's brother brown's
[48:58] hand on that it may not be me maybe i
[49:01] won't have faith enough to do it
[49:03] but somebody is going through him
[49:06] trouble with everybody wants you to
[49:07] believe it's them that's why
[49:08] sex fly off that's why things father
[49:10] said you can't get into my church even
[49:11] get it nowhere well that's just as wrong
[49:13] as romney's ever been
[49:15] that's where cults have raised up in
[49:16] this message and gather
[49:18] men around themselves oh there's one
[49:20] quote i want to read you and this is the
[49:22] brother i'm talking about the condition
[49:24] of the ministry today look in this quote
[49:26] it's in satan's eden in 1965
[49:31] oh my the theme of it is today this is a
[49:35] paragraph 108
[49:36] the thing of it is is today we don't try
[49:39] to establish the word of god in the
[49:41] people's hearts
[49:43] we are trying to establish ourselves
[49:46] right
[49:47] how many of you run into god like that
[49:49] it's all about me
[49:50] mine us them
[49:54] my brothers and sisters we don't try to
[49:56] establish the word
[49:58] of god in the people's hearts we are
[49:59] trying to establish ourselves
[50:01] right churches are trying to establish
[50:03] the doctrine of the church in a person's
[50:06] heart right
[50:06] we are commanded to establish the word
[50:09] of god amen
[50:10] paul said i didn't come to you with the
[50:12] enticing words of man that your faith
[50:14] might
[50:15] rest up in the knowledge of man but i
[50:16] come to you in power
[50:18] in manifestations of the holy ghost that
[50:20] your faith might rest in god
[50:22] there you are man mustn't establish
[50:25] yourself
[50:26] oh what a statement man mustn't
[50:29] establish yourself right
[50:31] we find it amongst let god do something
[50:33] for a person and send him out
[50:35] you find every man trying to impersonate
[50:37] it see they're trying to establish
[50:39] themselves right
[50:41] every man i did this me i mine my
[50:44] denomination
[50:45] me this establishing themselves
[50:48] what are we preaching about ourselves or
[50:50] the kingdom of god
[50:52] establish the word of god that's our
[50:56] goal tonight
[50:57] establish the word of god take out the
[50:59] unbelief
[51:00] and establish the kingdom of god in a
[51:02] man's heart
[51:03] and the kingdom of god cannot be
[51:05] established in a man's heart
[51:06] unless god made that man thus right
[51:09] right oh my
[51:11] and remember the deceitful part that man
[51:14] think that it's right there's a way that
[51:15] seemeth right unto a man every
[51:17] intellectual being
[51:18] seems right we run into a lot of them
[51:21] this is the only way i heard brother
[51:23] neville say this morning someone might
[51:25] have asked him why i didn't preach on
[51:26] the holy ghost
[51:27] why didn't i do this here it is you
[51:30] ready here it is you want a lesson on
[51:32] the holy ghost here it is
[51:33] the holy ghost is the action in you
[51:37] it's a life it's a life not an emotion
[51:41] not some sort of a fleshly evidence but
[51:44] it is the person amen
[51:46] jesus christ the word of god established
[51:48] in your heart
[51:49] to quicken every word of this age amen
[51:52] right watch the holy ghost in action not
[51:55] so much in denial
[51:56] not so much in demonstrations but in
[51:59] action
[51:59] what it does according to the word
[52:03] you want to know if you got the holy
[52:04] ghost how do you know not in
[52:06] emotions i mean motion isn't going to
[52:10] tell you you've got the holy ghost right
[52:12] brother brown said the evidence of the
[52:13] holy ghost is when you can say amen
[52:15] every
[52:17] that's the word of the baptism of the
[52:19] holy ghost right well i didn't feel
[52:20] nothing who cares
[52:22] when did it become feelings anyway in
[52:26] some of the greatest miracles where you
[52:27] wake up one morning you don't feel
[52:29] nothing
[52:30] feeling nothing is a good thing right
[52:32] right the man i don't know who's
[52:34] whose testimony it was he had a pain in
[52:36] his arm he woke up and he felt nothing
[52:38] that's a good thing
[52:41] having the holy ghost and feeling
[52:43] nothing right
[52:44] away with experience as you're measuring
[52:47] life
[52:48] come on brothers and sisters so many
[52:50] people you especially out in these youth
[52:52] camps and i'm not against youth camp
[52:54] all right all right i'm halfway against
[52:56] youth camp yeah
[52:57] i would get some youth camps all right
[52:59] but people get out and that's all they
[53:01] want to do is get the holy ghost get the
[53:02] holy ghost get the holy ghost get the
[53:04] holy ghost and
[53:04] they get the same crowd back next year
[53:06] and they're getting them the holy ghost
[53:07] again
[53:09] and they come back the next year and
[53:10] guess what they're still doing they're
[53:11] getting the holy ghost again
[53:14] away with that my dear brothers and
[53:16] sisters what is the holy ghost
[53:17] it is the life of christ in you they lay
[53:20] hold on that promise may not have one
[53:23] ounce of emotion behind it right
[53:26] hard may not have one else
[53:29] none i want to ask you when brother
[53:32] brown was carefully explaining to us
[53:34] the life of christ coming into mary what
[53:37] did mary feel
[53:38] right what's the word he used nothing
[53:41] that's right
[53:42] mary felt nothing right yet she was
[53:45] impregnated by the life of god
[53:48] and she felt nothing right
[53:52] that's enough feeling nothing is enough
[53:56] right i know we're going to get you just
[53:59] somebody can jump up back there and
[54:00] maybe i know you're thinking already
[54:02] well brother i'm feeling if you don't
[54:03] feel nothing you're dead
[54:06] you're dead to the world
[54:16] brothers and sisters i believe god is
[54:19] conditioning us for this
[54:21] i believe he's getting us ready i
[54:24] believe we got some sick
[54:25] second smiths out there teaching us the
[54:27] way man you're not gonna do it they're
[54:29] gonna pound us
[54:30] they're gonna smack us around they're
[54:33] gonna knock his plum over four ropes and
[54:35] into those chairs and we're gonna think
[54:36] we broke our back
[54:37] right it's gonna hurt everybody all
[54:40] right but then the pain will leave
[54:42] all right maybe you'll feel nothing and
[54:44] you'll learn
[54:45] i don't know medically how accurate that
[54:47] is i you know i know everybody that's
[54:49] got complaints about brother brown i'm
[54:50] sure some doctor will raise them see
[54:52] that ain't how it works at all well
[54:53] it works good enough for me that way all
[54:55] right right if he learned it from six
[54:57] seconds that's a lesson i want to learn
[55:00] that's right
[55:00] i want to believe that god is right now
[55:02] conditioning me as a part of this bride
[55:05] for that last big punch is going to come
[55:07] one way
[55:08] for that last big onslaught right and
[55:11] when that squeeze comes down
[55:14] brother wade calls and tells me i just
[55:16] got a free trip set up for alaska
[55:20] it ain't gonna be fun but he'd be here
[55:22] somebody's gonna head there
[55:24] it may not be me it might be him he's
[55:27] got his book laid out he might be
[55:28] planning on it i don't know
[55:30] i don't have an alaska brochure on my
[55:32] desk
[55:34] i believe god right is going to have us
[55:37] ready for that
[55:37] glory amen i don't think we're going to
[55:40] wake up we're just going to hide in our
[55:41] closet crying and sniveling and
[55:44] we're going to remember this life amen
[55:47] we're going to remember
[55:48] right he had a trial along this way
[55:50] right we're going to remember when we
[55:51] got knocked over than four ropes and
[55:53] into the chairs and thought our back was
[55:54] broke
[55:55] and we're going to remember god doing
[55:57] something for us and we're going to
[55:59] remember
[56:00] and something in our hearts is going to
[56:03] raise up and say you know i remember
[56:05] when that third pull was temporarily
[56:07] manifested
[56:08] when i saw the opening of the word move
[56:11] in my life
[56:12] and the word go out there and heal me
[56:14] i'm going to remember that
[56:15] right and now that i really need it and
[56:17] now that this big lick has come
[56:19] i'm going to be able to take it i
[56:21] believe god is doing that for his family
[56:23] i believe we're part of it i'm glad to
[56:25] be part of it i'm glad to be in the end
[56:27] time when the last big lick of satan is
[56:29] coming right
[56:30] because you know what ain't gonna hurt
[56:32] nobody else after that right
[56:34] you remember school when they used to
[56:35] pick on your little sister you got to go
[56:37] through me you know
[56:38] i'm willing to take it for her all right
[56:40] why because
[56:42] it's good it's the last one right that's
[56:44] the last one amen
[56:46] don't you love him do you believe it's
[56:47] real sir i believe it i believe
[56:49] jesus said he's looking at an oncoming
[56:51] storm that's coming
[56:53] i believe he's conditioning this amen
[56:56] conditioning
[56:57] you might hear some hard things come
[56:58] over this pulpit most pulpits have
[57:00] hard things they're they're true ones
[57:02] that's right brother i said why do you
[57:03] want to just go to church if they just
[57:05] pet the babies and marry the women and
[57:08] marry the
[57:09] some churches they marry several women
[57:10] but we're not going to talk about that
[57:13] that's those guys over there in that
[57:14] pile of scarecrow yeah don't get
[57:16] discouraged by all of that no right
[57:18] don't get all alarmed this person right
[57:19] here is doing that what do you think of
[57:20] that i don't think nothing of that
[57:22] i just think he's not called to the same
[57:24] word that i'm
[57:26] i am called to a life of purity and
[57:28] holiness under this word
[57:29] and i'm called to a promise and it
[57:32] becometh me to fulfill that
[57:34] i don't fulfill this word because i'm
[57:36] supposed to unfulfill it because it's
[57:38] becoming due right
[57:39] now it's calling me it's drawing me
[57:41] that's it and it's preparing me
