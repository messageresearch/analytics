[0:10] god bless you could be in the house of
[0:12] the lord this morning
[0:13] you come with an expecting heart
[0:16] i
[0:17] can't wait to hear what the lord has in
[0:19] store for us today
[0:21] so we've been in uh the book of hebrews
[0:24] and we're on chapter seven um let's just
[0:26] go to the lord in prayer and ask him to
[0:28] bless the study lord lord we're so
[0:30] grateful to be able to gather together
[0:31] today lord we just ask lord that you're
[0:33] just blessed brother reed as he's back
[0:35] there studying lord and lord open the
[0:37] scripture to us as we study these things
[0:39] out and just be with us the services
[0:40] today we ask in your name amen
[0:44] so hebrews chapter 7 is very meaty and
[0:47] if you remember back in in hebrews
[0:49] chapter 5 paul when he started talking
[0:50] about he he kind of touched on
[0:52] melchizedek just briefly
[0:54] and he said
[0:55] he said uh he he mentioned melchizedek
[0:58] and then he said he backed it looked
[0:59] like he backed off from it and he said
[1:01] um
[1:03] i've got a whole lot more to say about
[1:04] this but this is for somebody that's a
[1:06] full age uh that that to because it's a
[1:09] little bit deep
[1:10] and so uh we want to we want to we
[1:13] uh kind of started talking about it last
[1:15] sunday and and want to dive into it a
[1:17] little bit more
[1:19] because this gets into some some really
[1:21] meaty things where you came from and
[1:23] where you're going and and and and what
[1:26] we're going back into the into the mind
[1:28] of god and and so let's tackle this this
[1:30] morning
[1:31] with the help of the lord so it says in
[1:33] in in verse one for this melchizedek
[1:35] king of salem
[1:37] um
[1:38] and we know king of sale king of king of
[1:40] jerusalem
[1:42] priest of the most high god who met
[1:43] abraham returning from the slaughter of
[1:45] the kings and blessed him
[1:47] to whom also abraham gave a tenth part
[1:49] of all first being by interpretation
[1:51] king of righteousness
[1:53] and after that also king of salem which
[1:55] is king of peace
[1:56] and you can get all those things from
[1:58] the the name
[1:59] what what the word melchizedek the name
[2:02] melchizedek means you can pull that out
[2:03] of the hebrew and what what that's
[2:06] speaking of without father without
[2:09] mother without descent having neither
[2:11] beginning of days nor end of life but
[2:13] made like unto the son of god abideth a
[2:15] priest continually so he's he's
[2:17] stressing
[2:18] to he's trying to make the point to the
[2:19] hebrews that um this this man is
[2:22] is above
[2:23] above abraham somebody that could bless
[2:26] abraham somebody that abraham would want
[2:28] to give ties to
[2:29] um somebody that that levi who was in
[2:32] the loins of abraham who would out of
[2:35] levi would come the priesthood was was a
[2:38] so great that levi and the loins of
[2:39] abraham would pay ties to him so this
[2:42] man is greater than the priesthood that
[2:44] the aaronic priesthood
[2:46] now consider how great this man was
[2:48] under whom even the patriarch abraham
[2:50] gave the tenth of the spoils
[2:51] so last time i asked kind of ask the
[2:53] question why
[2:54] why did why did abraham pay ties to this
[2:56] man because abraham recognized that this
[2:58] man was was god that he was god come
[3:01] down to talk to him so you know and i
[3:04] kind of posed the question why do we pay
[3:06] tithes well we pay tithes not because
[3:08] we're we're trying to um try to fill the
[3:10] pockets of of some man or something
[3:12] because we recognize that we're we're
[3:15] getting something from something from
[3:16] god that god's speaking to us and we're
[3:18] trying to do just like abraham did
[3:20] we we want to do according to what the
[3:22] what the bible says
[3:25] because we recognize the presence of god
[3:27] in our midst that god is doing something
[3:30] we pay tithes not to a man but we're
[3:32] paying tithes really when you pay tithes
[3:33] you're paying ties to god
[3:35] now now if you go i just want to kind of
[3:38] set in your mind there's there's
[3:39] patterns in the scripture so when you
[3:41] look at the scripture look at these
[3:42] patterns and brother brown will lay out
[3:44] this pattern that abraham met
[3:46] melchizedek twice he met him in genesis
[3:48] 14 and then he met him in genesis 18
[3:51] when he come with
[3:52] with the two angels come walking and he
[3:54] saw him in the plains and there he was
[3:56] in the tent and he looked up and there
[3:57] he was standing next to him and he he
[3:59] bowed us
[4:00] he
[4:01] bowed his head and and began to say if
[4:03] you go back and read and study genesis
[4:05] 18 all those things but i just want to
[4:06] lay out there's a beginning lay out that
[4:08] pattern there's a beginning and an end
[4:10] there's a pattern and every every story
[4:13] in the bible there's a pattern that um
[4:16] jesus
[4:17] at the river jordan and then jesus on
[4:19] the mount transfiguration
[4:21] david being anointed by samuel and david
[4:23] being anointed by the whole tribe of
[4:25] israel
[4:25] you're being born again and you come to
[4:27] a place of adoption
[4:29] there's a place where you there you meet
[4:30] melchizedek in a place where you come
[4:33] you've uh you've you've had communion
[4:35] with with melchizedek and been
[4:37] uh well we'll get we'll get to that in a
[4:39] second but listen
[4:41] in genesis 14 it says melchizedek king
[4:43] of salem brought forth bread and wine
[4:45] this is in genesis 14 when abraham met
[4:47] him with that first time
[4:49] after the battle to rescue lot from
[4:51] cheddar leomer and all the all the kings
[4:54] and it says he was the priest of the
[4:55] most high god
[4:56] and he blessed him and said blessed be
[4:58] abraham of the most high god possessor
[5:00] of heaven and earth said see now the
[5:03] brother and and and paul would lay out
[5:05] this this pattern he said that
[5:07] god we know that this this man was
[5:10] greater than abraham because he was the
[5:12] one that was doing the blessing
[5:14] and blessed be the most high god which
[5:16] have to deliver thine enemies into thy
[5:17] hand and he gave him ties of all
[5:20] but let's uh
[5:22] so brother adam said and who is this
[5:24] melchizedek he said when abraham met him
[5:26] he was melchizedek he unfolds here
[5:29] what all the attributes will do in the
[5:31] final end all the attributes of god so
[5:34] now he's going back into the mind of god
[5:36] that we're
[5:36] god thought of us and four knew us and
[5:39] and and he's thinking uh he he's taking
[5:41] us back every one of those attributes
[5:43] are gonna go through the same journey
[5:45] that abraham's going through
[5:47] every every son every attribute is gonna
[5:49] have to meet melchizedek every attribute
[5:51] is going to have to have communion with
[5:53] this man
[5:54] with god
[5:55] every son of the faith will absolutely
[5:57] do the same thing now isn't that true
[5:59] with all these all these stories you
[6:00] read about in the bible you see you
[6:03] as as christ is revealed to you it
[6:05] begins to open up that revealed to you
[6:07] the same journey that these people these
[6:09] the abraham and ruth and david and all
[6:12] these in the bible the same journey that
[6:14] they went on you're going on that same
[6:16] journey that they typed you're going
[6:18] through it in reality
[6:20] but let's let's kind of meditate on this
[6:21] now when when when
[6:23] abraham and genesis 14
[6:25] met melchizedek
[6:27] melchizedek this god come down to him to
[6:31] commune with him
[6:32] served him bread and wine now let's
[6:35] think about that
[6:37] in genesis 14 it says he brought forth
[6:39] bread and wine
[6:40] you know all through the scripture what
[6:42] what what is communion when you when
[6:43] you're serving bread and wine when we
[6:45] come to the house of the lord today
[6:47] we're not looking to i don't think
[6:49] abraham sat down and was expecting maybe
[6:51] cornbread and mashed potatoes and
[6:54] green beans and that kind of thing
[6:56] but you know we're not coming for that
[6:58] that kind of carnal thing when we come
[7:00] to the house of the lord but what we're
[7:01] coming to is is to partake of the
[7:04] revelation of who god is of who jesus
[7:07] christ is and you see when when
[7:08] melchizedek came and sat down with
[7:10] abraham and offered him those things
[7:12] what what really that's speaking of is
[7:14] that he's sharing of himself
[7:16] he's revealing himself and you see maybe
[7:19] maybe we'll just say like taste and see
[7:21] that the lord is good
[7:22] you when you come to the house of the
[7:24] lord you want to taste and see
[7:26] taste a taste and how do you taste as
[7:28] you eat of the word eat of the body word
[7:30] of christ
[7:31] in revelation chapter 3 it says behold i
[7:34] stand at the door and knock if any man
[7:36] hear my voice and open the door i will
[7:37] come into him and will sup with him and
[7:40] he with me so melchizedek's coming down
[7:43] he come down to sit with abraham and
[7:46] commune with him and sup with him and
[7:48] you see that's that's that promise all
[7:50] through the scripture is that god wants
[7:51] to sit down and reveal to you reveal to
[7:54] you himself to commune with you
[7:56] even in revelation chapter 10 go and
[7:59] take the little book that's that's what
[8:01] really what communion is is it go and
[8:03] take that book and eat it eat and what
[8:06] are you eating you're eating that manna
[8:08] where christ said i am that bread of
[8:10] life that came down from god out of
[8:11] heaven
[8:12] i am that manna that was typed in the
[8:14] wilderness when it fell and so we're
[8:16] eating the body word of christ where
[8:18] jesus said those those confusing what
[8:20] confused them at the time those words in
[8:22] john chapter six he said then jesus said
[8:24] unto them verily verily i send to you
[8:26] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[8:28] man
[8:29] and drink his blood you have no life in
[8:31] you except you eat except you take this
[8:34] bible and you eat it and the spirit come
[8:37] and quicken it you don't have any life
[8:38] in you who so eateth my flesh and
[8:40] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[8:43] i will raise him up at the last day
[8:45] for my flesh is meat and deed and my
[8:47] blood is drink indeed he that eateth my
[8:50] flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in
[8:52] me and i in him as the living father
[8:54] hath sent me and i live by the father so
[8:56] he that eateth me even he shall live by
[8:59] me
[9:00] so now now think about that pattern that
[9:02] melchizedek come down to communion with
[9:04] abraham at the beginning of his journey
[9:07] sat down with him and he began to eat
[9:08] now isn't that the same thing that you
[9:10] and i do when you're when you're born
[9:12] again with that eternal life come down
[9:13] and filled you with his filled you with
[9:15] the holy ghost and you started to eat
[9:17] and you started to eat this word and the
[9:18] spirit began to quicken it and you began
[9:20] to move from that from there your
[9:22] starting point
[9:23] you you start at the starting point of
[9:25] your journey and you begin to eat and it
[9:27] build and build and build see that's
[9:29] that's what that's what melchizedek
[9:31] means to me is is that god coming down
[9:34] to have a personal relationship with you
[9:37] my brother ram said and who was this
[9:38] melchizedek he said notice now his
[9:41] attribute so now now we got to go we got
[9:43] to go back into the back part of god's
[9:45] mind into the thinking of his mind he
[9:47] said then the attribute was first god
[9:50] the thought the attribute itself
[9:52] all in one without being expressed
[9:56] then when he expressed secondarily he
[9:58] became then the word
[10:00] and then the word was made flesh and
[10:02] dwelt among us saint john the first
[10:05] chapter in the first verse notice this
[10:06] is in the beginning but before the
[10:08] eternal notice in the beginning was the
[10:10] word when the time began it was word but
[10:13] before it was word it was attribute a
[10:16] thought
[10:17] now now
[10:18] let's let's let's don't get tired so so
[10:21] quick now let's let's think about these
[10:22] things that
[10:23] even in your own even in your own
[10:25] natural ability you have a thought and
[10:27] then when you speak it then other people
[10:28] can understand what you're thinking
[10:30] about so god god had a he had thoughts
[10:33] about he was going to be a redeemer and
[10:35] a healer and a savior and he thought
[10:36] about those things but it had to be
[10:38] expressed so that's what that's what
[10:40] brother brown was expressing now that
[10:42] that god wanted to manifest the things
[10:44] that he thought about the attributes of
[10:46] himself so that they would come into
[10:48] being come into manifestation he said
[10:50] now we're getting where melchizedek is
[10:53] that's this mysterious person the word
[10:56] the logos that theophany in the
[10:58] beginning was the word and the word was
[11:00] with god and the word was god
[11:02] and then the word became flesh and dwelt
[11:04] among us hold that there now notice his
[11:07] first being was spirit god supernatural
[11:10] all right the great eternal
[11:12] second he began to form himself towards
[11:15] flesh in a theophany it's called the
[11:17] word a body now see his first being was
[11:20] spirit god supernatural the great
[11:22] eternal so how are you going to
[11:24] understand that how are you going to
[11:25] understand what what brother branham
[11:26] explained as a diamond in one place or
[11:28] fountain in another place or a rainbow
[11:30] in another place with all these
[11:32] attributes a fountain with streams of
[11:34] love and righteousness and all of these
[11:36] things all these attributes that god
[11:38] desired to express
[11:40] how are you going to understand that but
[11:42] god manifests he come out with that
[11:44] logos he expressed himself in the logos
[11:46] the body the attribute of the fullness
[11:49] of the word and began to come down into
[11:51] sin because his ultimate goal was to put
[11:54] himself in flesh his ultimate goal to
[11:56] manifest himself in christ and then from
[11:58] there to manifest himself in a body of
[12:01] believers that he thought of before the
[12:03] foundation of the world
[12:05] this then is the state he was in that
[12:07] that state of the logos the theophany
[12:09] when he met abraham was called
[12:11] melchizedek he was in the form of
[12:13] theophany well now we'll get to that and
[12:15] prove it in a few minutes the lord
[12:17] willing he was the word
[12:19] so now that's what john is talking about
[12:22] john if you want to go back and study uh
[12:24] john honestly is as i think is one of my
[12:27] it's
[12:28] one of or my favorite book in the bible
[12:31] because it's that eagle book and john
[12:34] starks off he hits the ground running
[12:36] with the famous statement in the
[12:37] beginning was the word so that's what
[12:39] we're talking about in the beginning was
[12:40] the word the logos
[12:42] that god expressed himself in and the
[12:44] word was god was with god and the word
[12:46] was god
[12:48] the same was in the beginning with god
[12:50] all things were made by him
[12:52] and without him was not anything made
[12:54] that was made
[12:55] in him was life and the light was the
[12:58] light and the life was the light of men
[13:02] so what are we talking about we're
[13:03] talking about eternal life
[13:04] eternal life that god
[13:07] wanted to express to you and i to give
[13:09] to you and i and what's the point that
[13:12] paul is trying to make here in hebrews
[13:13] is that you're not sufficient in your
[13:15] own self you needed you needed eternal
[13:17] life you needed eternal life that this
[13:20] melchizedek had in him to express to you
[13:22] that god came down to to fulfill his his
[13:25] thought of you before the foundation of
[13:27] the world that was the true light which
[13:29] lighteth every man that cometh into the
[13:31] world he was in the world and the world
[13:32] was made by him and the world knew him
[13:34] not he came unto his own and his own
[13:36] received him none
[13:38] so let's start let's start looking at
[13:40] some pictures here now now think brother
[13:42] brown expressed that the father is that
[13:44] diamond the attribute the attributes the
[13:46] thoughts of god so so begin he began to
[13:49] start coming down and out of he he
[13:51] expressed himself out of the out of the
[13:53] out of all of those attributes that he
[13:55] wanted to express he expressed himself
[13:56] in the logos the theophany now i've got
[13:59] i've got this little graphic here of the
[14:00] like a a little orange man
[14:03] just to kind of show to illustrate the
[14:05] the supernatural element of this but
[14:08] what was this what's a theophany look
[14:10] like it looks like the person
[14:13] that they often come down and talk to
[14:14] abraham and it didn't look like some
[14:16] kind of glowing thing it was it looked
[14:18] like a man and brother brown said it's a
[14:20] it's got a higher thinking a higher a
[14:22] higher hearing a higher speaking all of
[14:23] those things but yet it's got five hit
[14:26] ten fingers and ten toes because it's a
[14:28] body and he would make that point over
[14:30] and over again that god is not just kind
[14:31] of like some spirit some
[14:34] floaty around but he's actually some
[14:36] he's he's a body that you can look at
[14:38] and understand and that's what this
[14:40] logos is it's something that you can
[14:42] relate to he's coming down so that you
[14:44] can understand him he wants to be
[14:46] understood
[14:49] and brother adam said in the pillar of
[14:50] fire he said and now the bible teaches
[14:52] us that the logos went out of god or i
[14:55] might say all of the god becoming his
[14:57] first body form when the logos went out
[15:00] of god
[15:01] let's look what it looked like
[15:03] no one has seen the father at any time
[15:06] nowhere never did and never willed
[15:08] you're never going to see the father but
[15:10] the only way you're going to see the
[15:11] father is as like jesus said if you've
[15:12] seen me you've seen the father because
[15:14] the word is the expression of the father
[15:17] and if the word is in you then you are
[15:18] the expression of the father you can
[15:20] that's what i i make the point
[15:22] if you want to see what who god is
[15:24] maybe maybe when you're listening to
[15:26] tape you're hearing god's voice maybe
[15:28] when you're hearing the preaching you're
[15:29] hearing god's voice because god is
[15:31] manifesting himself through his bride
[15:33] today that's what that's what the whole
[15:35] point of that sermon who is this
[15:36] melchizedek that that same god that
[15:39] manifested himself to abraham and came
[15:41] down in christ that same god is on the
[15:43] scene today at his bride
[15:46] no one has seen the father at any time
[15:48] nowhere no nowhere never did and never
[15:50] will but then the logos that went out of
[15:52] him become like a little halo of light
[15:55] let's see it playing yonder like a child
[15:57] before the doorstep of the father and
[15:59] now i can see him as he moves over here
[16:01] and he draws into his memory or his mind
[16:04] a picture of what the world should be
[16:06] you think about the logos playing like a
[16:08] little child how should i i i i don't
[16:11] know if you've had a chance to look at
[16:13] those uh pictures of the new telescope
[16:15] that they just launched the james webb
[16:16] telescope they can go can look way out
[16:18] into the galaxies and you think about
[16:20] the logos come
[16:24] playing like a little child on the
[16:25] doorstep of the father how shall i make
[16:28] the world how shall i make the solar
[16:30] system how shall i make the place where
[16:32] i'm going to come down and live and be
[16:33] manifested and he drew into his memory
[16:36] how in his mind because god never has a
[16:38] new thought never has a new thinking he
[16:40] knows the end from the beginning and the
[16:42] logos just drew in his mind this is how
[16:44] to do it and began to speak it
[16:46] he said there's not a star or nothing i
[16:48] hear him say let there be and an atom
[16:51] broke yonder and when it did the sun
[16:53] came into existence and began to whirl
[16:55] she burned for millions of years and
[16:57] millions and millions of years after a
[16:59] while i see a clinker fly off it what is
[17:02] it the first star that flew from the sun
[17:05] he watches it fall for a few million
[17:06] years and he stops it then another one
[17:09] flies off and he lets it fall a few
[17:11] million years and stops it what's he
[17:13] doing writing his first bible the zodiac
[17:17] so now the logos this great fountain
[17:20] brother brown explained and another see
[17:22] all these different ways that he's
[17:23] trying to express to us a diamond a
[17:26] fountain a rainbow all these things so
[17:28] we can kind of have some semblance of a
[17:30] picture in our mind
[17:32] of this this uh
[17:34] this office that you're you're never
[17:36] going to really understand with outside
[17:37] of the logos
[17:39] the logos this great fountain this great
[17:41] fountain of spirit which had no
[17:42] beginning or no end this great spirit
[17:45] began to form in the creation and the
[17:47] logos that went out from it was the son
[17:49] of god and it was the only visible form
[17:52] that the spirit had
[17:53] that was the only the only way that
[17:55] you're going to be able to know god is
[17:56] through the word
[17:58] and it was a theophany which means a
[18:00] body and the body was like a man
[18:04] so now let's let's examine now as we as
[18:07] god is condescending so we can
[18:08] understand who this man was that came to
[18:11] came to abraham and sat down with him
[18:13] and talked with him and began to have
[18:14] communion with him and share with him
[18:16] who he was and who his nature was and
[18:19] and all these things in a way that would
[18:21] make abraham recognize who that was and
[18:24] want to pay ties to him amen
[18:27] in john 1 18 it says no man has seen god
[18:29] in any time the only begotten son which
[18:32] is in the bosom of the father he hath
[18:34] declared him so so out
[18:36] from the god just uh
[18:39] we use like poor eye he everything that
[18:41] the father is that he poured into the
[18:43] sun that the attribute of the fullness
[18:45] of god which john 1 1 says in the
[18:47] beginning was the word
[18:49] the word was with god
[18:52] and the word was with with god and the
[18:54] word was god but but keep coming on now
[18:57] because because in in this logos he's
[19:00] got all these attributes not just
[19:03] redeemer and healer and love and savior
[19:06] and all those things but he's got
[19:08] attributes of you and i that he wants to
[19:10] express
[19:11] so in genesis 1 26 it says and god said
[19:14] let us make man in our image
[19:17] after our likeness
[19:18] and let them have dominion over the fish
[19:20] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[19:22] and over the cattle and over all the
[19:24] earth and over every creeping thing that
[19:26] creepeth upon the earth now how would
[19:28] how would you express this visually that
[19:30] god thought of everyone that was going
[19:33] to be expressed in his mind he had all
[19:35] of these attributes in him that were
[19:36] going to be expressed now the only way
[19:38] this is just me now the way that i want
[19:40] to express that this morning that is
[19:41] just put that put that uh
[19:45] put the statue of a perfect man on that
[19:47] because in every age he had a people
[19:50] that he was going to express in the the
[19:52] age of the ephesian church age and the a
[19:55] the smyrna church age he thought he knew
[19:57] of each one that was going to be
[19:58] expressed and they they were they had to
[20:00] come into being you see and we'll say
[20:02] another way to express is that god had
[20:04] like a book in his mind
[20:06] a book a a a book that he was going to
[20:08] express that unfold and you know that's
[20:11] the supernatural side but he actually
[20:13] put that book in writing here so that as
[20:16] you read this bible you're actually
[20:18] reading what he thought of before the
[20:20] foundation of the world and as the side
[20:22] effect of christ being revealed when
[20:24] christ is revealed it actually reveals
[20:27] you in his word because when christ is
[20:30] revealed it reveals you because you're
[20:32] part of him you're part of his word so
[20:35] as as as his word is revealed you see
[20:38] your part where you fit into the bible
[20:41] where you where
[20:42] you see the role that you have to play
[20:45] you
[20:46] preachers read ephesians 4 11 and they
[20:48] see their part believers read malachi 4
[20:51] and they see their part that their
[20:52] hearts are going to be turned back you
[20:54] read the book of the in revelations
[20:56] where it talks about believers in
[20:57] laodicea and you see that you're part of
[20:59] that and as christ's word is revealed it
[21:01] reveals that you're part of him
[21:04] that's what genesis 1 26 27 is talking
[21:07] about in the believer's position in
[21:08] christ brother brown said when god made
[21:10] man he said let us make man in our own
[21:12] image let us give them make man in our
[21:15] image spirit man and give them dominion
[21:16] over the fishes of the sea and the
[21:18] cattles and so forth he said now back
[21:20] there before the foundation of the world
[21:22] god chose you in christ jesus to appear
[21:25] holy at the end time all the way from
[21:28] the foundation of the world that's what
[21:30] genesis 1 26 is speaking of that god
[21:32] before the foundation of the world that
[21:34] you were chosen in him that he thought
[21:36] of you that that he
[21:39] he had that part of his eternal life
[21:41] that part of his word reserved for you
[21:43] that when when
[21:44] in the day that you would be manifested
[21:46] you would pick up the bible or you would
[21:48] hear the preaching of the word and it
[21:50] would be quick in the life the life that
[21:52] he saw that you would receive before the
[21:54] foundation of the world
[21:56] what what what brother ram in hebrews
[21:58] chapter 4 he said was god a man
[22:00] certainly let us make man in our own
[22:02] image what was god a theophany a body
[22:05] and their man was made like that and put
[22:07] over the garden but there was no man to
[22:10] till the soil and the senses then he
[22:11] created man out of the dust of the earth
[22:13] and the animal life and that man till
[22:16] till the soil and the man fell by
[22:18] transgression correctly and god the
[22:20] theophany come down and was made flesh
[22:23] and dwelt among us to redeem the man now
[22:26] now
[22:27] let's not lose track of what we're
[22:29] talking about we're trying to we're
[22:30] trying to lay the foundation of who this
[22:33] is that came to talk to abraham who who
[22:36] is this who is this melchizedek who was
[22:38] that melchizedek that came and talked to
[22:40] him
[22:41] and questions and answers on hebrews
[22:43] number three brother ram said
[22:44] well what do we do well my dear sainted
[22:47] brother my dear sainted sister before
[22:48] the foundation of the world when god
[22:50] created you in his image or created the
[22:53] man in his image and created the woman
[22:55] in the image of the man for the glory of
[22:57] the man he made you a theophany just
[23:00] like himself when he said led us to the
[23:02] creatures that he had made
[23:04] you're you're part of christ
[23:07] in hebrews chapter five and six he said
[23:09] he had and so therefore melchizedek the
[23:11] great priest like a man he had no
[23:13] beginning and he has no end and when we
[23:15] through that theophany that we were made
[23:17] in the image of god before the world was
[23:19] ever made when that theophany has been
[23:21] made flesh and dwelt among us then
[23:23] through his death
[23:25] we ourselves receive his spirit and we
[23:28] have no end eternal life
[23:30] now see there there's that melchizedek
[23:32] without without father without mother
[23:34] without beginning of days or end of life
[23:36] and then when you've got that same
[23:37] eternal life imparted to you then you
[23:40] also will have no
[23:42] with no end eternal life
[23:45] look at this plan that god's trying to
[23:46] manifest as we got like two more minutes
[23:49] he said and john we come all the way
[23:51] from john chapter one no man hath seen
[23:53] god at any time
[23:55] in john 1 1 in the beginning was the
[23:57] word and the word was with god and the
[23:58] word was god
[24:00] genesis 1 26 and god so let us make man
[24:02] in our image after our likeness and john
[24:05] 1 14 and the word was made flesh
[24:08] and dwelt among us
[24:09] that's what god is trying to do is come
[24:11] down to flesh
[24:13] to tabernacle himself and flesh so let's
[24:16] let's maybe change the the the the way
[24:18] this looks that we got a little a
[24:20] picture of jesus there because that's
[24:23] that that melchizedek he's working his
[24:25] way down to being tabernacled in the
[24:27] flesh of jesus
[24:29] which is what jesus when jesus prayed
[24:31] there john chapter 17 we've got this
[24:34] whole picture laid out in this prayer
[24:36] where he said these words and we'll end
[24:38] on this note he said these words spake
[24:40] jesus
[24:41] and lifted up his eyes to heaven and
[24:43] said father the hour has come glorify
[24:45] thy son that thy son also may glorify
[24:47] thee
[24:48] as thou has given him power over all
[24:50] flesh that he should give eternal life
[24:53] to as many as thou has given him
[24:55] and this is life eternal
[24:57] that they might know thee the only true
[24:59] god and jesus christ whom thou has sent
[25:02] and in verse four he said i have
[25:03] glorified thee on the earth i have
[25:06] finished the work which thou gavest me
[25:07] to do and now our father glorify thou me
[25:10] with thine own self which with the glory
[25:13] which i had with thee before the world
[25:15] was
[25:17] now see that's that contradicts if you
[25:19] go investigate oneness theology you'll
[25:21] find out that the oneness oneness do not
[25:23] believe that you can use the word son of
[25:25] god the term son of god before the
[25:27] incarnation of christ so the term son of
[25:29] god they don't believe that the son of
[25:31] god was manifest before jesus was
[25:34] incarnated
[25:35] he said i have manifested thy name unto
[25:37] the men which thou gavest me out of the
[25:39] world those that were the attributes
[25:41] that god was longing to express
[25:43] i have manifested thy name unto the men
[25:45] which thou gavest me out of the world
[25:47] thy they were and thou gavest to me and
[25:49] they have kept thy word
[25:52] god coming down from thought to
[25:55] attribute to flesh and the musicians go
[25:57] ahead and come forward and we'll end on
[25:59] that note in hebrews chapter 7 he said
[26:02] this melchizedek was not jesus for he
[26:04] was god and what made jesus and god
[26:06] different that jesus was the tabernacle
[26:09] that god dwelt in
[26:11] this man had no father no mother no
[26:13] beginning of days or ending of life
[26:15] but it was the self-same person
[26:18] melchizedek and jesus was one but jesus
[26:21] was the earthly body born and fashioned
[26:23] after sin
