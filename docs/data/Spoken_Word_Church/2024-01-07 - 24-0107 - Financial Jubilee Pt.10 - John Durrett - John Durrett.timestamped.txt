[0:52] morning in Jesus Christ name amen praise
[0:56] the Lord Jesus well it's a new year
[1:00] and guess what we're still
[1:03] fighting still fighting I'm sure as you
[1:06] guys look back through the past year and
[1:09] not just in finances but in all areas of
[1:11] our life it is a fight this journey of
[1:14] life is a fight and um you know when I
[1:17] think of financial Jubilee you know I
[1:19] just want to set the stage you know I'm
[1:22] not trying to um make anyone
[1:26] Rich okay this is not a Prosperity
[1:28] Gospel no right but what I'm here to
[1:31] tell you you're already rich very
[1:33] different you are already
[1:37] rich that's the key right but there's a
[1:41] key to all of this all of this see we're
[1:44] not just rich in our finances we're rich
[1:46] in all areas of our life and Jubilee is
[1:49] about Freedom not just in your finances
[1:51] but in all areas of your life amen see
[1:55] whatever we touch in our life we can
[1:57] have the victory whether that's your
[1:59] marriage whether that's your children
[2:01] whether that's your adult children
[2:03] whether that's your parents any area of
[2:06] your life we can have the victory we
[2:09] have these promises in God's word that
[2:11] tell us we have this amen okay and as I
[2:16] prayed and I asked God Lord give me
[2:17] wisdom Lord what would you have me to
[2:19] share and this is something that's been
[2:21] in my my heart throughout the years you
[2:23] know we've been around the message a
[2:24] long time was born in the message so
[2:27] I've been there since the beginning
[2:30] literally since the beginning of my life
[2:32] so I've seen many many things in this
[2:35] message from people coming in people
[2:38] going out pastors coming in pastors
[2:41] going out pastors retiring new pastors
[2:43] coming up pastors leaving the message
[2:45] Pastor coming into the message all of
[2:48] that I've witnessed that people dying
[2:51] marriages being broken apart divorces
[2:54] everything debt bankruptcy you name it
[2:58] we've seen it all and many of you have
[3:00] seen it so you ask the question we have
[3:02] all these precious promises all of these
[3:05] precious promises if I'm saying you're
[3:08] rich today if I'm telling each one of
[3:09] you you're rich and you're like well you
[3:13] know but what's the part I'm not getting
[3:17] what's the part am I missing in
[3:20] this okay and the part that you're
[3:23] missing the key is what's in red that
[3:26] fight my my my see you wouldn't have to
[3:30] fight if there wasn't an
[3:33] enemy that's the problem that's why I
[3:36] like to tell the young people tell my
[3:38] kids that's the problem yes you can make
[3:41] your plans you could do this you could
[3:43] do that we can make our plans we could
[3:44] sit aside we can say hey we're going in
[3:46] this direction this is what we're going
[3:47] to do but there's an enemy amen my my my
[3:52] that changes the entire perspective that
[3:55] changes what we're looking at that
[3:57] changes this journey that's why we have
[4:00] to fight and as we come into 2024 that's
[4:02] what I want to challenge us with
[4:03] fighting we have to fight
[4:07] amen and that's it we have to pight
[4:10] let's go to the next
[4:15] slide
[4:17] so of course when when I talk about
[4:20] financial Jubilee this quote always
[4:22] comes with me where a prophet says clean
[4:24] up your lives pay your debts owe no man
[4:27] Jesus said get all things off your hands
[4:29] get everything right Make Ready Get
[4:32] Ready remember in the name of the Lord
[4:35] something is fixing to happen do we
[4:38] still believe that my my my we're in
[4:41] this hour my my my the coming of the
[4:43] Lord is closer than it's ever been so as
[4:46] we approach this year let's let's do
[4:48] that let's clean up our lives all areas
[4:50] of your lives let's clean them up if you
[4:53] have debt let's start paying those
[4:54] things off let's start listening to this
[4:56] word let's get everything ready by the
[5:00] grace of the Lord Jesus it's time now my
[5:03] my my let's get everything ready the
[5:06] coming of the Lord is closer than it's
[5:08] ever ever been my my
[5:11] my and our Prophet comes along the next
[5:14] quote in the message the great warrior
[5:16] Joshua let's go back up sorry go back up
[5:19] he says and I'll say come on you got
[5:21] something to do too God just don't poke
[5:24] things down your neck you've got to
[5:26] believe it you've got to do some
[5:29] fighting that's the word you're hearing
[5:32] it not from me you're hearing it from
[5:33] our Prophet that's telling us did we
[5:36] miss that part in this message that we
[5:38] got a part to do we got to do some
[5:40] fighting my my my you have to fight I've
[5:44] been fighting all my life all my life in
[5:48] every area of my life so we show up here
[5:51] we're smiling we're fighting since we
[5:53] moved down here we've been fighting
[5:55] before we moved down here we were
[5:57] fighting in every area of our life we've
[6:00] been fighting why because we have to
[6:03] overcome so we should look around and
[6:05] see everybody take a look look at each
[6:07] other if you think someone is not going
[6:10] through some problems something is
[6:13] wrong don't be fooled don't be tricked I
[6:16] don't care how happy they look I don't
[6:19] care how settle they look I don't care
[6:22] how good their marriage looks to you it
[6:24] doesn't matter they're fighting believe
[6:27] me if you are not fighting you already
[6:32] caught there is so much that this word
[6:35] has for us and none of us are there if
[6:38] we were there we'd be raptured out of
[6:40] here we would be gone so when you look
[6:43] around you should see soldiers brothers
[6:46] and sisters that's fighting if you ever
[6:48] think well no that brother's fine I
[6:49] don't need to pray for him my my my if
[6:52] you think your pastor is find your
[6:54] preacher our brother his family no pray
[6:57] for them amen pray pray for them pray
[7:00] for one another this year more than
[7:03] ever look and say nope that sister looks
[7:05] good clean but I'm sure she's fighting
[7:08] because she's here she goes to this
[7:09] church she's a Christian she's fighting
[7:12] she's fighting it's something she needs
[7:14] help on something she needs to overcome
[7:16] they're
[7:18] fighting okay and as we take that
[7:21] approach that would put us in the right
[7:23] direction that is the key to me is that
[7:25] we have to fight amen let's go to the
[7:28] next slide
[7:30] and the key behind it all I think some
[7:33] of the confusion and certainly for me
[7:35] certainly as I look at the journey is
[7:38] that we hear the word of God it's
[7:39] preached it's brought forth you hear
[7:42] something you hear something like this
[7:43] and this is Joshua the great warrior
[7:45] Joshua you can imagine him starting his
[7:47] ministry Joshua 15 he said there shall
[7:50] not any man be able to stand before thee
[7:53] all the days of thy life amen as I was
[7:55] with Moses so I will be with thee I will
[7:58] not fail thee nor forsake thee
[8:02] boom that's how we hear the word we hear
[8:05] it just like that I'm in the message
[8:07] thank God I have arrived I got married I
[8:11] love my precious sweetheart I got a job
[8:15] it's all good from now on man I'm ready
[8:20] I'm excited thank you I'm a Christian my
[8:24] my my my my and you can take it further
[8:26] right we know from this church the
[8:28] teaching praise God you get born again
[8:30] we thought we had it all we had we were
[8:33] done wrap it up your journey is going to
[8:35] sit back and sail you're on the message
[8:37] bus for the rest of your life my you
[8:40] don't have to do anything find your seat
[8:42] get your pillow sleep we'll wake you up
[8:44] when you arrive it doesn't work like
[8:46] that come on brother it doesn't work
[8:49] like that at
[8:50] all at the end of that chapter and then
[8:54] shall you have good
[8:56] success my wow but it's a lot in between
[9:00] verse five and good success and that's
[9:04] the same thing with your marriage same
[9:06] thing with your finances same thing with
[9:07] this word of God same thing with this
[9:10] journey my my my so if you're ever
[9:12] hearing that word of God and you're
[9:14] hearing just that part you got to say
[9:16] okay wait wait a second whose part is
[9:18] that that's God's part you absolutely
[9:21] believe he's faithful he has already
[9:23] done his part matter of fact he has
[9:24] already paid the price and it wasn't
[9:27] easy for him as well
[9:30] okay it cost him something okay so now
[9:34] as he lays out his part when you hearing
[9:37] the word of God okay you got to say okay
[9:40] Lord that's your part you're faithful
[9:42] amen I truly don't have to worry about
[9:44] you fulfilling your part you are there

[9:48] every area of your life you're going to
[9:50] be Victory and you're going to have

[9:52] finances with your children all these

[15:01] situation there are many many turns in
[15:04] this road my brothers and sisters many
[15:06] roads many turns and we're shocked we're
[15:11] shocked your wife has a little bit more
[15:14] to say in life than you thought she had
[15:16] to
[15:18] say she got a little bit more feelings
[15:20] than you thought she
[15:24] had and your husband doesn't know as
[15:27] much as you thought he
[15:29] knew he trying to figure it out
[15:33] too but I thought he was going to be my
[15:35] daddy no he's your husband he just
[15:38] doesn't
[15:40] know you mean to tell me he's not going
[15:42] to ask me when he go by that boat and
[15:44] that 25th gun that he has
[15:49] huh he's not going to ask me about that
[15:52] he knows that bothers
[15:54] me huh but I thought we were supposed to
[15:57] be Christians and we got this all
[15:58] figured out
[16:01] my my my my and my kids oh man they
[16:04] going to listen to me all the way yeah
[16:06] right they're going to be just these
[16:08] little angels not my family I'm telling
[16:11] you they all going to sit across that
[16:13] road and they all going to be up here
[16:15] singing and just excited and wow my and
[16:19] they going to listen to whatever I tell
[16:21] them whatever I tell them they going to
[16:23] listen to me because I'm I've had all
[16:25] this wisdom so I'm so happy I can share
[16:27] everything with them and they're going
[16:28] to take it
[16:30] on but I thought we were Christians
[16:32] though I I thought we had it all WR now
[16:36] we
[16:37] do but we're missing that key that we
[16:40] have to fight we have to fight through
[16:43] this thing my my my keep that in mind my
[16:46] brothers and sisters we have to fight
[16:48] through this journey and we can overcome
[16:51] let's go to the next
[16:56] slide let's go to the next
[17:02] our Prophet comes along and says and so
[17:04] a army first and getting ready for
[17:07] battle first there's got to be a
[17:10] selected some
[17:11] soldiers again as I said look around
[17:14] we're all soldiers in this journey my
[17:15] brothers and sisters they've got to be
[17:17] dressed for fighting amen okay we know
[17:20] the whole armor of God we have to have
[17:22] that on us every single day every single
[17:27] day okay
[17:29] they've got to be trained trained for
[17:34] fighting you have to be trained my
[17:36] brothers and sisters I truly believe
[17:38] that's where we have missed the boat on
[17:41] a lot of these things from the natural
[17:43] to the spiritual that we have to be
[17:46] trained amen right you know being around
[17:49] this message for so long I've seen so
[17:52] many things amen see Brothers come in
[17:55] get married die young old right okay go
[17:59] through stress problems trying to serve
[18:02] the Lord okay trying to serve the Lord
[18:05] with all of their heart right okay and
[18:07] get out there get married have kids
[18:10] pastor's trying to say don't have so
[18:11] many kids so quick somebody else and
[18:14] have a lot of kids and then next thing
[18:16] you know they're in a struggle struggle
[18:19] brother can't come to church he has to
[18:21] take two jobs to take care of his
[18:23] family okay and now he wants a little
[18:27] pleasure okay so he goes out and get him
[18:29] a loan because he deserves it man he's
[18:32] been working so hard he can't hardly
[18:33] come to church he's stressed he's
[18:35] nervous but now I need to get me a loan
[18:37] because I need something at least want
[18:40] my wife to be proud of me so I'm going
[18:42] to get this loan I'm going to buy this
[18:43] house that I can't afford I'm going to
[18:46] go get this house I need to take care of
[18:48] my family I need to show for all of
[18:50] these years of working that I can
[18:53] accomplish
[18:55] something this is a true story
[18:59] and end up with so much pressure that he
[19:01] starts going into his
[19:03] basement inhaling
[19:05] gas and died got liver bladder cancer
[19:09] and died this a true story a message
[19:12] brother in this message that was
[19:14] faithful as I know he could
[19:16] be okay so it's not a joke this battle
[19:20] is very real it's not just a say so or
[19:24] something easy to say or light to say
[19:26] it's very real amen okay it's very real
[19:31] and it requires us to do everything we
[19:33] heard and to be on our knees okay that's
[19:35] the only way we're going to have success
[19:37] is be on our knees praying to God he
[19:39] then brings his word to us we take it on
[19:41] we observe day and night go into
[19:44] training mode that we need to be trained
[19:47] because we have
[19:48] it we have it I have the testimonies you
[19:52] know the testimonies where you know
[19:53] someone is successful in this area of
[19:55] their life you know someone is
[19:56] successful in that area of their life
[19:58] okay okay right sure then that is
[20:00] available to us amen it's available to
[20:03] us but everything that we heard about
[20:06] your part we have to take that on in
[20:09] truth okay and know it's that kind of
[20:11] battle yes I don't care how old a couple
[20:15] looks how they long they've been married
[20:18] don't ever think that couple can't
[20:20] separate don't ever think that they've
[20:23] been together for 30 years they're fine
[20:25] I don't need to worry about them anymore
[20:27] no brother pray for them that sister and
[20:30] that brother still have a mind they're
[20:32] still human okay there's still pressure
[20:34] in this journey so that's why we can
[20:36] pray for one another I don't get 40
[20:38] years I've seen couples 40 years and
[20:40] then the wife wants to live somewhere
[20:41] else because she get tired of dealing
[20:43] with them okay and she gets a separate
[20:45] home and they're both still Christians
[20:47] both still coming to church the same
[20:49] message church but they're not together
[20:51] they can't live in the same house tired
[20:53] of it frustrated exhausted and tired of
[20:57] it Ain it brother okay so this is the
[20:59] same battle all of us are facing but
[21:01] we're getting tricked and thinking that
[21:02] it's not that kind of battle they're
[21:04] fine I don't need to pray for them no
[21:05] pray for everybody look at each other
[21:07] like Soldier you're doing good thank God
[21:09] you're here but hey I'm lifting you up
[21:12] I'm lifting you up I know the pressures
[21:14] of this journey because we have an enemy
[21:17] hey it can take you out in a battle
[21:19] soldiers die the war still may be one
[21:22] but somebody could be missing limbs
[21:24] somebody can be missing arms the battle
[21:27] is one we know that but I don't want to
[21:29] go out with no arms I don't want to not
[21:32] know how to use my weapon I want to know
[21:35] how to use my
[21:36] gun okay I heard the first thing they
[21:39] train you in the Army just something
[21:40] that they do just to kind of get you
[21:43] conditioned join that Army first thing
[21:45] they train you to do kind of day one day
[21:47] through that early period how to unclog
[21:50] your jammed gun and how to carry a dead
[21:54] body get your mind ready for the worst
[21:58] case scenario cuz this is a battle okay
[22:01] this is a battle and that's the same
[22:03] thing we have to have that type of
[22:05] expectation there is an enemy we are on
[22:07] this journey to fight okay we can pray
[22:10] for one another we can come together and
[22:12] we need training right right we need the
[22:15] training of the Lord to get us through
[22:17] that all right quickly I'm just going to
[22:19] run through some of these principles
[22:20] just to remind you about financial
[22:22] principles and the reason I I like these
[22:24] principles because I think we all can
[22:26] relate to them when we talk about money
[22:28] we can all relate to it so I like to
[22:30] just use that as kind of a guide a map
[22:32] to say man these things in the word of
[22:34] God if I can prove to myself that I am
[22:36] rich if I can prove through the word of
[22:39] God that I'm rich and I can see it in my
[22:41] life then I can take that same thing and
[22:43] model that in all areas of my life okay
[22:47] and fight my way to it because God
[22:49] already told me he's going to be
[22:50] faithful with his part he's already
[22:52] promised us that so he's not going to
[22:53] let you down okay he never lets us down
[22:57] we we in turn Miss what he's saying and
[23:00] we let it
[23:02] down the principles of finances that we
[23:04] talked about is God owns it all okay he
[23:07] owns it all so that's how I can tell you
[23:09] you're rich he owns all of it he's your
[23:12] father right amen is he then joint
[23:17] ears then are you rich so what's the
[23:20] problem it's not him promise you it's
[23:23] not him okay the 10% is his and the 90%
[23:28] principle number
[23:30] two you can't sit on the bus sleep with
[23:33] your
[23:34] finances you got to manage it diligently
[23:37] it is his but he's well organized trust
[23:39] me he knows exactly what he doing for
[23:41] thousands and thousands of years before
[23:43] the foundation of the earth knew he knew
[23:44] his plan I'm going to come down I'm
[23:46] going to die I have a BRI I have seven
[23:48] Church boom boom boom look how organized
[23:51] he is every day he can let the grass
[23:53] grow the fall went he is organized and
[23:57] we're going to make it not being
[23:59] come how it's
[24:02] impossible you will never know you're
[24:04] rich if you don't apply his
[24:07] principles you won't ever know you can
[24:09] have these precious promises unless you
[24:12] do your part Faithfully you got to
[24:14] manage it diligently you got to realize
[24:17] there is an enemy so money it can be
[24:19] your master it absolutely can be your
[24:22] master and you cannot serve God or
[24:24] manmen it can be your master you sleep
[24:27] it'll guide you it'll take you where you
[24:29] don't want to go believe me you will be
[24:31] working three or four jobs trying to pay
[24:32] off your debt or you'll be saying I'm
[24:34] not worried about it I'll pay it back
[24:37] when I leave or I'll leave it on my wife
[24:39] or I'll pass it down to my kids whatever
[24:41] no we shouldn't be that way right
[24:43] principle number four patience hey you
[24:45] got to wait on the Lord you got to see
[24:46] him work you run out there and you get
[24:48] ahead of him you're going to find a way
[24:51] the enemy will find a way for you but
[24:53] you have to wait on the Lord to see to
[24:56] see avoid Deb like the curse that's it
[24:59] waiting on the Lord You Will Wait so the
[25:02] blessing of the Lord it maketh rich and
[25:04] he added no sorrow with it think about

[25:44] one pro principle number six safe for
[25:47] the winter seven giving is the best
[25:49] investment is more blessed to gift than
[25:51] to receive to be able to see God work as
[25:53] you're giving amen and principle number
[25:56] eight contentment so these these were
[25:57] the principles of financial Jubilee that
[25:59] we've laid out that's been shared but
[26:01] that's not my word that's the word of
[26:02] God things that we have to help us start
[26:05] understanding that we're not just rich
[26:06] in our finances we're rich in every area
[26:09] of our
[26:10] life I love the story as I close out we
[26:13] remember brother R told that story of
[26:16] the uh the older lady and she lived in
[26:18] that home and you know she was living
[26:20] very poor and charity came down to look
[26:22] at her said what's going on what's going
[26:24] on with her you know don't you have a
[26:26] son isn't he taking care of of you she's
[26:28] like oh I don't like to bother him I

[26:31] worked so hard in his life and I don't
[26:34] want to put any strain I'm okay you know

[26:53] money just with pictures of them from
[26:55] India let's say with a bear and a tiger
[26:58] and that's how their money looks and she
[27:00] was well off and didn't know it and our
[27:05] Prophet concludes and saying hey he says
[27:07] the same thing you are rich right amen
[27:10] we are rich my brothers and sisters
[27:12] we're rich in every area of our life and
[27:15] we're rich in the
[27:17] word but we got to fight we got to fight
[27:23] all the way until the end 2024 I said
[27:27] Lord help me me don't expect that this
[27:29] is going to be an easy
[27:31] Journey but always expect that if I do
