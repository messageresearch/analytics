I want to see amen and amen and I want to see him don't you man good to see a buddy in the house of the Lord I hope you come expecting to receive because that way it makes it easier for me to preach you know you know we had a real marvelous time last night the Bible study we had you know there and had the kids had dirt a little part so we've got a little different what we've been doing and they had theirs and it went good and we had ours and and everything so we just appreciate all you doing and getting everything straightened up and all you know Michael made it last night he come in to be with all of us we appreciate it amen that's real good so just remember that there to pray one for another remember the brother boy's class and sister Monica's class will be gathering two up here in

involved and how means going and what's going to get it all in place okay so make sure you do it today don't come up next week so well I missed you I didn't well you know what today so let it be today or sign up or forget it you know that's best way to say it because that hurts feelings but you know you don't want to be told to forget it good we're doing it too Amy anything else any announcements we miss nothing they also remember these things we thank God for for being with all of us and taken care of glad we'll have brother Russ with us he came down Friday their day early and we had an extra day of fellowship and so that's really wonderful and we just appreciate it on it father we thank you for this day in your grace we thank you for all things and we ask you now that you would just come among us in a mighty way to open our understanding of thy word because that's what we gather for we don't get her to be seen or to talk or to fellowship or whatever that's all well and good we do those things but we gather to hear from you and we just ask you to bless and guide each one remember the sick ones among us remember where I all brother dick there and all the different ones that are sick and not here today just bless each one that your loving grace will be with us all we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen we've been still on Hebrews 11 so let's start there and just read the scriptures from Hebrews 11 and continue I thought on into the point we're trying to bring okay brother Lewis is not here he's over brother I think brother burly's this morning and brother Williams is seeding it or something like that he's got four day to day so I'll remember that and we'll try to get in touch with him to tell him he's gonna do Wednesday too so that'll give him a full week you can do those times okay so if you contact him tell him to be expected that's it you know to be here the Lord willing wins d4 don't then we'll figure out something else okay all right hebrews 11:32 remember what we're saying this is written about the Old Testament Saints and their faith journey and the things that are transpiring or were transpiring with them then and you know it's really still transpiring some of the things that are here are still taking place to the natural Israel all right and it will finish up in in you know in the doing but this is what our lives well verse 32 in what shall I more say for the time would fail to tell of gideon and of Baruch and of Samson and jeppesen of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued righteousness obtained obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions now notice they have achieved certain things so they attained some promises but in the minute we'll see they didn't didn't get all the promise quench the violence of this violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness was made strong waxed violent and fire turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured and accepting not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection all right no others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging yay moreover of bonds and of imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword and they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented even the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise no they never attained to the promise but look at all that the great things that they done and it happened there under those Old Testament Saints God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect you may be seated the Lord that is blessing through the reading of the word alright what is the yeah you don't have to turn all of them all knew by doing the switches okay all right all right now as I've tried to get you to see and I've spoke on these things many times but trying to move on into it a better thought of understanding that we could follow and talk about that these great warriors of faith that we call these ones that done all of these things but yet they never came to a perfect ending of all that they'd done they never received the new birth right they achieved a lot of things done a lot of things under the anointing of the Holy Ghost all right but they never received the promise what promise the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right what else would be the promise they never received that point so then they're by by not receiving the Holy Spirit see they could not come to a plea to a state of completion which that word perfect gar they could not be made perfect that doesn't mean that's a sinless perfection it means the point of being not complete if Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and that does not mean sinless perfection there it means that you have not achieved a complete goal all right now then they without us should not be made perfect you say yeah but Jesus raised the Old Testament Saints according to Matthew 4 and 4 all of them didn't raise many of the Old Testament Saints didn't raise and Paul has no problems putting David in this group and putting all the different ones into this group of here that's waiting he had no problem with that why should we have problem with it yeah but see I heard brother songs when I saw I heard two brother you know and they said well now Jesus raised them back and without him they couldn't be made perfect and said now it's making the New Testament - worth it without us they cannot be made perfect well what you want to do that will not leave it all it's in Jesus whether it be old our New Testament the resurrection and the things are defended upon him not dependant upon me and you that would be something that we would do that would be a form of something of a sinless perfection that we could draw forth and and then they could be chained no no it's all in Christ he is the resurrection there's there's nothing that's not a great thing that they're saying well we could do this but we got to wait on them well alright if that's true then let's get on with what's doing that's the only thing that I've ever said whatever you think this will take place to do these things let's get on with it let's get it into manifestation because we've had 50 years since they're going or the Prophet - brought these things - pies alright and see then we're not looking at something to try to raise them from the dead and perfect them even if you would say okay we're talking about the New Testament of Luther them and all like that they're not made they're not at the perfection because they're not in the glorified state all right what's even if you could bring them up in it they'd still be problems you know not problems in the flesh uh but problems because you wouldn't be fulfilling the rest of the work everything is waiting on you and I all right but now is our point we tried to end the message to give you a background enough to be able to say what we wanted to say and what we were talking about is God is waiting on you and I see we spend a lot of emphasis and it's wonderful that those people back here the Old Testament they're waiting on you and I aren't the best you can do out of the Old Testament Saints is go to revelations four and pick up that 24 elders which is twelve apostles twelve patriarchs and you say well those and you know they're there but remember they're not there in glorified bodies but a bit of a wolf where's the Twelve Apostles are they there in glorified bodies I just have simple questions I like to do that I like to ask questions if you think the Old Testament was perfected okay well what about the new words if where's the apostles so chapter four is not literal glorified people it would have to be something different because those in chapter four the 24 elders Twelve Apostles fourth patriarch the Twelve Apostles is their bodies is in the grave right I mean is that Scripture their bodies are still in the grave waiting on you and I you know the 12 apostles you know hold the church is dependent waiting on you and I not but see then we have something to do as we'll get to it later in the message brother Brennan said that Jesus never completed his whole thing because he left something for us well alright if they something left that's not completed then the point is right everybody is waiting and dependent upon this endtime bride whether it be Old Testament Saints or New Testament Saints everybody's waiting on me and you even God is we've tried to emphasize with the life's messenger even God is waiting on you and I well God's waiting on us no I'm waiting on God well you're not getting what I'm talking about you're trying to make it into some other form God is waiting on you and I to believe him and let him make it benefit it'll all be him that's what I've said a moment ago would it be Old Testament resurrection where it be New Testament it's all in Jesus Christ it ain't you and me in a way it's just what we're doing it's the position that we have been put in somebody has to stand in this place why can't we believe we're them somebody's going to do it why can't we believe that we're the people the Bible says that were the people at the end of all things is coming for well why can't we believe that all right see then what was our point that we covered last week on uncovering it you know trying to show and brother Branham says they don't want to pull these I'll give you a number and we'll start with of it in a minute but brother Branham said on my chest it was a great priest he says those Old Testament talking about Abraham Isaac Jacob those who were heirs of the promise looking forward to us not to fail looking forward to us not to fail well and he says for without us they cannot be made perfect and how they're depending on us to us this morning let's not fail those Old Testament Saints is dependent upon me yeah but how are their dependent there they're not in the glorified body that's what a point I try to make so you listen what about you 24 elders in my revelations for you're gonna have the Twelve Apostles sitting there in some form and their body in the grave and you're gonna have a twelve apostles you know twelve Old Testament prophets sometimes you're gonna have them there in glorified bodies no that's why everything's waiting on you and I everything is waiting on this end time people well why can't we believe that if they're not waiting on that's why they're waiting on well we're waiting on time to run out I didn't believe that in the Baptist and I certainly don't believe it now I was looking for something and I'm still looking for something what I'm looking for God to come on the scene and make his work life make manifest what he said he would do he's put it all into this position all right we gave you another one we're brother Brennan said from the message glorify Jesus have it to those Old Testament Saints are looking now without us they cannot be perfected so they're depending on us to believe God's Word they what a weird word you said well well what are we to do brother Dale to try to make us believe God's Word first I'll believe he's talking about you cousins we was talking about it last night in the Bible study see everything is waiting for somebody to just stand up and say I believe it well we're not it no that's that's the point see a man named Martin Luther looked at the Bible looked at the things looked at the world looked at the church and he come out and he preached the just shall live by faith all right God was waiting on that he was waiting on Martin Luther to fulfill his word well see we say Martin Luther was waiting on God we're really God was waiting on him he's waiting on somebody the Prophet said if God can get one person to believe his word he said he can do what he needs to do just one person they don't take a world full of people see John Wesley come forth with being the coming to America to preach to the Indians to convert and found out he said I needed to be saved myself he goes back with a message of sanctification and confounds the world with it you know what we'll do it God was waiting on John Wesley there were people that are already had preached sanctification to Moravians ever how you pronounce their name they were teaching that own sanctification that's where Martin Luther I mean where John Wesley went to them and caught what they were doing and went back home pretty because he's seen him alive if you remember the story they were in a boat and the boat was about to sink well over here is the people burnt over there second and over here was the Moravians is singing and worshiping and just having a good time you know kind of reminds me of the lady he remember the Prophet was telling about the story of it and the lady said well if the captain said was boats going down in 30 minutes she's hollering praise God praise God glory hallelujah he said you didn't understand we're going down in 30 minutes or we're gonna be in the harbor the lady said well said I got a daughter in the harbor and I got one in glory said in 30 minutes I'm gonna be with one of them she was resourcing two that she wasn't the Moravians wasn't afraid that's what Westwick what it called they need he knew them they had something he didn't have so he needed that he already had the new birth of justification he was preaching what a Luther's messaging and all like that coming forth with old Sonny but yet he needed a further advancement so what was happening he said well no God was waiting he's waiting on somebody now to just stand up and believe it and say thank you he can make it manifest he got no problem making it manifest he can do that without us but yet he said his self he's waiting on us because we're talking about life's not cease the brothers asking the question about you know finding the Bible and reading the Bible say I don't have to read in the Bible that I can read it that without us they're not perfect but see I don't have to read that I know they're not perfect I know something is wrong something is wrong would you agree with that today that there's something wrong we've been 50 years after the going of the Prophet and had an opportunity to get into the word what's wrong it's evidently you and I so evidently God is waiting on somebody to step forth well okay why can't we believe with that wonder step four see all right you are you following what I'm saying he's his own perfection talking about the Old Testament heroes with heroes of faith and he says without us they could not be made perfect because they're of the shadow of this to come and see we've heard it verifies ability purport to be right when it when it's speaking of these here that never receive the promise do you understand that they never received the promise they never got to a salvation point they never got to a new birth those Old Testament Saints they were waiting Jesus had to come they to bring that to where they could come to salvation later date because they never received it they rejected him they turned it down and they're still to this day waiting waiting on God to fulfill his word you go over talk to those Jews and I just sent over our twiddling their thumbs they're reading their studying they're getting everything for fire they're trying to do everything trying to build a temple trying to do everything that that they think will be the part of it but we know what's going to be the part of it one day there's gonna be two witnesses walk out there and they're gonna see who they are okay that's all that I'm trying to get you and I to do and see who we are the Prophet said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for he said she'll be an investable army alright God's waiting on you and I become to find it out after we're doing all of it and we say God he's waiting for you and I to realize who we are well I don't know one day I'll feel like I'm saying next day I wonder about it well what you need is a good of salvation are you saying I'm not safe yeah I don't mind saying it that way one brother one time he said brother Dale said he got up and told him people that I wouldn't say I didn't do it the next time I talked to him I said you told him people a lie I never said you wouldn't say yes you said I said no I said he fewer and saves you wouldn't act like you are I said now if you want to turn that around and say it I'm saying you're not saved I'm saying you're not saved see somebody's got to come to a place to where we can believe it and say thank you lord and let him come on the scene all right because what is it trying to get down to that point brother Branham covers on what the Holy Ghost is given for what if the Holy Ghost he said without us that cannot be made perfect see what did the Old Testament Saints need they needed the Holy Spirit right they needed a new birth all right what do they need now the Bible says until this day the veil is over their eyes and whether they're in the grave there waiting or whether they're live there waiting waiting on watch waiting on you and I to get out of the way let's see if I'm here quoting ones talking about the pillar of fire coming something and it's / phrasing but he said said they see that pillar of fire coming after you and me think it's coming after them right thank you coming after them but now it's coming like for you and I because we're the next in order and what we do and we step out of here that can follow us thinking they don't have any way to go because you got a house something in front of you yeah that early church walked out in the faith of God and you know what today I still believe that Martin Luther preached to just shall live by faith and I still believe that I'm still based upon what he said well right based on what he said called he drank beer and sat in the pub smoke the pot well boy you know the gospel you sure are in good shape God's waiting on you and me to get out of that junk that's the denominationalism all right sorry but it's true right okay without us they cannot be made perfect they lived in one day we live in another day so it's all dependent right here where we're at okay he says on the message the statue of a perfect man see then you'd see coming into the New Testament these people who died in here are dependent and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and thereunder souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to the perfection that Christ does come those people all the way down through time of the New Testament they're waiting on you and I we have the greatest responsibility of all ages because everybody is dependent upon whether or not we can believe who we are but you see the people of the message now what are they doing they're doing their best and destroy the message instead of trying to get into the message and believe in it leave it there you know brother Russ atomic density you know that brother Brian said if you catch me off one word he said didn't I'm totally out well now what is he meaning he was a human being that we got a lot of experience I mean a lot of things that he'd done and to happen is he waiting is he's saying if one word off or is he saying it the correct way then it if it is one word off it's not what we're doing they're not doing it's whether or not we believe the Word of God if he was one word off then I don't want to believe him well I can show where he missed to that come let's talk about it that's what I say you're so gallant to holler and scream about it coming let's talk we'll take our time we'll sit down and we'll discuss it I'm not gonna argue with nobody but I'll be glad to discuss it I sure like that earnestly contending for the faith you know I like that part ain't gonna argue with you about it I'm just gonna believe what he said okay we'll see we know then for understanding that it's not talking about something that we can raise the dead we can do this we can do that if talking about the fact that when the bride realized who she is and what she's here for you said well what are we here for we're here to be that part of the people of God that can believe God's Word enough until the world is waiting everything's waiting upon the bride of Jesus Christ to realize who they are you said well mama Nelson well mom was waiting on you let's believe it to where we can go forth with it all right now he's waiting and see we look at something and we say we can't see that but I just don't see that made manifest you know so that by we were rejected okay all right on the message of the statute of a perfect man he says it like this this church has got to be honed the church has got to be home and all those stones fitting together and he says all right not only just some creed or doctrine or something other we come through it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ to when he comes he in that ministry will fit right smack together well I just don't say nobody would administer your Jesus Christ open your eyes what are you looking for what do you got 1/2 to where God could prove it into you well you know I think you'd ought to be these great signs of one now your prophet Wade's been doing a good job on that talking about a revival the revival is not signs and wonders and move books and isn't that in the other that's the after-effects of the revival the revival is to revive the person bring the person to a place in Christ that God can move on the scene my whole emphasis has been on one thing on this point they're trying to get us to see cuz I said I preached this and many many times just a few months ago we would on this about they without us cannot be made perfect well my point now is for one thing God is waiting on you and I all right he's waiting for us right to do some things and let's see what those things are now as we try to go through it this at this day all right now look at it like this go ahead and them will start from number six they can pull up number six which is God's provided way of healing then run it down to the bottom where we got it you say well brother branham you say let us that's what God is waiting on we're waiting on Jesus to return and Jesus is waiting on us that we excel we can see that easily that we're waiting on Jesus to come and do something but he's waiting on us to do something what does he expect us to one time believe him he's not waiting on us to do these great signs and wonders and is that caught we can't do him anyway he's waiting on us to believe them is that the point we're waiting on Jesus to return and Jesus is waiting on us so they ain't gonna be no return of Jesus Christ unless the bride realizes it look you say well now what can we do about it okay the Bible said the hour has come and his bride has made herself ready hallelujah made herself ready now how are you gonna make yourself ready I mean my little bride my wife got up this morning and she made herself ready she put on some clothes she took a bath she done the things that was necessary for her to do and she put on some clothes that had no you know what a meaning trying to get to her did I doubt for her all right I bought up she put him on well she's making herself ready and that's all God is willing to do he's already paid for everything's all available all we got to do just believe it and accept it we don't have to work nothing up he done done in this house all right look see then is what does he say we're waiting on Jesus to return when that when he comes boy I'll tell you what it's gonna be great now when he comes he's got one eye well how come he ain't got here maybe it's you and me maybe it's you and me well maybe God is waiting on you and I because that's that's the emphasis I want you to get go ahead number seven we believe that the god of history still lives today and he was called on the scene talking about that believes a child okay that's one he's talking about the little child in the Bible raised on up a little foot petition to the park we'll get that but what was he doing the epileptic child God has always wanted to do one thing I've always tried to preach it this way and I believe it he wants you to call him on the same that's what your prophet said what were they doing with the epileptic child they couldn't get him healed but here come Jesus call him on the same but are we afraid to call him that could be one thing we could be afraid I've always thought about living and doing in this form can you just turn around and think about him being there or would you want to change something if he knew he was coming you're trying to call him on the scene but then you want him to wait until you get the house plane you know what I mean not physically house plane this house are we worried about that well I don't know what I want him to come home now well then you ain't gonna go get the point of what I'm talking about and if you believe why if you believe that the god of history still lives today and he was called on the scene and the epileptic epilepsy left the child he was called on the scene he wants us ready don't know a little bit more on his promise is just as true as there ever was in his time that his people called him called on him raised him up from history part is written Jesus Christ the same yesterday today he is he's a historical God and he's a present tense God he is a historical God but he's a present tense god a historical God will do you no good I don't serve a God that I have to call him on the phone and get him to come up or do something no he's waiting on me that's the point I'm throwing us to a halt to see God is waiting on you and I to call him on the scene night listen there's one over in here in a minute ago where he's talking about this conditions that we're in I'll find it but he says says these are in other words God ain't counting all them things he just waiting on you and I to call him on this thing he ain't waiting on us to get good enough that's our point you ever talk to people well when I when I one when I quit smoking when I quit doing it I'll be saved then I'll get saved but I can't do it like this and this bad condition well you don't need saving then you know cause you're you're not a dependent upon nothing else you're thinking about your own self of something good come on trying to get a point to its own something to talk about go ahead he's a historical God he's a present tense God he is that was a historical God and give the promise and we're two people today of his pasture with his sheep of his row and he's waiting on us to stand and call him on the on the action call him on the scene watch him go in to move us watch him do the supreme watch him do the thing that man will wander and scratch his head and not understand he's the historical God and a president in Scott he's waiting to be called out of history the brother on pre-sentence one toddler you know raised in God from history you realize he's a historical guard to most people oh yeah this brother right I'm not throwing no stone this man right over here today he's preaching about a historical God what's the difference in what he's trying to do and what we're trying to do I'm not trying to get you to believe in a historical God I'm trying to get you to believe in a God as president teams right now not to come but he's here now if you don't get nothing out of the message for anything to me you realize that's what brother Dale's always tried to do for the 50 years that I've been preaching I've tried to get to church to see a Living God what good is a dead God what good is a God that won't come on the scene which we try and see what we're trying to do that's my emphasis the whole point of oh you don't get it what we're trying to do is maybe get good enough you know or do this without of the other some deed we could do some idea some thought we could do that we'll brain God on now it reasoning from history raising him from a historical point about God Aurra point about your God that's not real that's trying to emphasize a minute to gonna turn my thought oh but can you turn around and see Jesus or do you want him to wait outside the door until you get ready to look at here or the medium what about it Church go ahead to the next one that's the eagle stirreth its nest well they don't know or what we need today is a calling together of getting ready and not dependent on the preacher right remember what weights been on on the revival part the preacher can't bring the revival well and I'm saying it just plain language you'd say if brother Branham was here today he'd bring a revival according to what he said now according to what he said he couldn't bring it when are you done oh you know now I'm just flying he's the one that said that you couldn't do it that way that the preacher can trying to revival it has to be you that brings the revival in if you're wanting a revival start doing it find out what's needed and do it might create a revival ok I'm not throwing oh I'm just making it plain cuz that's way too that I think what I'm waiting on this we'll all right but you know God's waiting on me and you come on that's my whole point make yourself ready for the coming of the Lord see but you as an individual before God make yourself ready for the coming of the Lord too escape all this corruption no matter what you call what they call you and what action they take that doesn't change god one bit God will do it just the same he's depending and waiting on us he's waiting on us that's the whole point I want the emphasis made over and over to God's waiting on us brothers that I've always just waited on the end now you know we don't how many hours how long you want them to spend where brother Bryan would even say this cell he said God was waiting on him to see what he'd do you ever heard him say that God was waiting on him see what he'd do what about me and you go to the next verse number 10 and those who are resting out younger in the grave earned the altar of God as the scripture says they're crying how long Lord how long how much longer God's waited on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible among us and raises our dead and we go in the rapture fifty years I've been waiting I just ain't seen him in 50 years the altar is open you need a good sagacious salvation if you ain't seen God in 50 years then God ain't in existence to you sorry that's as plain as I can be I've tried my best to get people to believe it and they don't they don't want to listen to you this message never brought a different God to me then the god I tried my best to believe because the God I tried my best to believe I seen him I worshipped him I prayed to him I believe I didn't change to another God when they come into the message change to my understanding of God was brought by the Prophet right but as far as me I believe the same God we we monitor our TV when we came into the message we thought it out the door but we monitor our TV when the kids was little they wasn't allowed to what this is 50 1950 60 earlier we wouldn't allow our kids to watch certain programs on TV and the fifties or sixties brother Branham didn't have to throw out a lot of things for us we were trying our best to live as Christians why can't we just do that that's what I've always said you see people that's messy no they're going great they're going good but then you let them backside first thing you do that will whack her hair off well the Bible tells you not to do that but around them didn't have to come to tell us these things well brother Branham come to tell us how to live well our already know how to live if he had a new birth Azusa Street had the baptism of the Holy Ghost they knowed how to live and they lived and done good may I quote brother Branham they were closer to the coming of the Lord than we are and quote it that's a quote from the Prophet who those people back tyre that lived and depended upon God and in their lives they had to because they they were digging out of living most of you never had to depend upon God we live to the point that what we planted if it wasn't raised we didn't have nothing to eat you kids and young people don't know nothing about that you got you well fires in here everything else to take care of he needed we didn't have none of that stuff I remember wrong brother tight I'm talking about it and he you know he said the eight to honey and his point was one thing you know how you poison cotton you put the cotton poisoned down into the bucket of molasses you had to have my license to be able to poison cotton then you take a little stain you make your little mop you make a little two-piece thing or something and you took that and I've done it all day long you take that and use there the cotton comes out and there's two little things like that and one it's like that you got to put that poison well what was the poison the poison was stuck together by the molasses and he said we ate the molasses that's how Porter had they ate up the molasses see that was when we was poor that we wondered what was going to get to eat with you that never been that way you don't know anything about it we come up believing God what about now okay no it's waiting on us believing it okay go ahead what are we the number 11 I guess number 10 with and what are we coming here for now I just caught this because it was in is waiting you know then what I was running waiting on us but it caught my eye what are we here what are we coming here for what have we been doing for 50 years since the going to the profit coming to church and trying to be good and doing the best we can do and you know what we been doing I've been in a revival ever since I've been in this message but it's a word revival my rejoicing is every day about the revealing of God's Word I've seen great signs and wonders all right seeing the dead rising all kind of sickness heal I see but that doesn't and just because I come into the message I never claimed the baptism when I was ago I told you for two years I didn't have it for two years that are coming to message I didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost will you come into magic did you use photos if you believe the message yes sir read six books in one day and listen to tapes you ever tried that I was packing that word in everything I could pack in but I knew at the same time I wasn't born again well I bought it again cuz I believe profit believe what especially now you pick up some of these things that are being thrown around now and claim that with the prophets message alright listen listen are we coming here playing a game what do you been doing I'm just seriously you take what you won't do of what I've said but it's Darin ain't having to worry about it but what have you been doing for 50 years come on you older ones would you closer to the Lord 50 years ago than you are now 20 years ago 10 years ago whatever you are you what's your closer then it wouldn't God there isn't it wouldn't die cuz you're not supposed to get worse you're supposed to get closer to God yeah I believe it come on are we coming here meeting as a lodge you know are we just a spoken word church Lula Georgia the only thing we know for us for believing the word that's special way to tell you because that's what everybody said there's one thing about that church up lugol's they believe the word you know don't go up there and try to do this out of good cuz they believe the word well what else could be the greatest thing to be I count that an honor people to say you just believe the word well that's one thing about it we get the seed in the field all we doing God's got to take care of the rest of it he's got to bring it up all I've ever tried to do is preach the gospel to get it planted in you God has to quicken it I can't make him but I can at least preach it to that degree look at it are we coming here meeting as a lodge it's Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right now whose fault is it if you don't get nothing get this whose fault is it God's waiting on you and I I've got the rest of going on through here a whole lot more quotes about it but is it enough to see now that God's waiting on you and I to call him on the scene call him up from history bring him from a historical God to a reality of a Living God then we can believe him well I'm just waiting on God know God's waiting on you come on look Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right he's waiting on us I believe we're at the end he's waiting on us well I I always thought brother dealing with that was waiting on him come on the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against it so then there's got to be something causing you or God to move on the scene into our life that can build up a standard and what are we going to believe it like in the early parts of our doings we were sorry but we were just about like a good old Baptist cause in the Baptist Church we believe we're saved we hope we're safe maybe we're saved if we're it is when we was a little different from the Methodists because what the method that's done they said you're justified and sanctified and if you fell backwards you had to come back and get justified or sanctified again and all I can and we Baptists we said no we don't believe it that way no no no we we don't believe it that way we believe we're we're once saved always saved when I told him me you know what the Prophet said about it he said if they're going with the word of God I'll agree with them do you agree with it if it's right but if it ain't right well good is it new to tutor Horned God ain't waiting on you and I to put out books and tapes and run it to the world now I'll give you one in a minute here where he says we need to be missionaries all right but he's not just waiting so while he's waiting for God every time you see anybody start trying to get anything to put the word out the denominations of this message cut it off I say that without no respect you know just say it for being the truth but what about it Church God is waiting on you and I what we get is that number 11 let's go to Troy over there let's get the message to the dine well we're going to send without with I'm sorry to be aggravating in arrogant and what I've talked would get the truth out of it the left don't blame everybody else I don't even blame the devil for me doing a lot of things my devil made me do it now I've done it on my own I don't even blame him for all of the problems I blame myself so if God's waiting on you and I you know it could be waiting on one person what about for wait all these preaching about a revival Nova if one person in here catches that and believes it God can make it manifest all he needs is one person now if we get a group now I like Terrance's way of doing it we talked about around here cause a lot of times you know here we're setting today we're we're down we're into the 70 or something like that class today and last week we was in the 90s or 100 or whatever and I like his way of saying things he said just leave it alone daddy say no neither building on the church because next week ain't gonna be that many here right you know we said well we got to build on Wilco we got we got enough seating in here for 110 and we got a hundred in here he said don't worry about it they'll be gone well then one of this get up and walk out and they just leave and this you know come on look let's get the message to the dying that's what I'm trying to do oh wait thou that sleepest you know what brother Ron said that was he said that was the bride in the denomination's you want that quote where it says awake thou that sleepest he said that's the bride in of the domination we ain't in no denomination we loo light when we can be a denomination just as much in Lula's all of them world fires out there are now we're not a denomination we're not like it was and went no brother biscuit and him I don't know where they change something but to come out with a how did they come up with or G or they put the daughter ordering the computer thing and this man laughing he said ain't gonna be in no organization that was the computer or RT we're we're smoking were church.com I didn't know denominations don't take for you it just takes one he said brother Dale you mean that there's people right here in this church denominations yeah because if we believe anything country to what this man has taught us we were denomination that's this plane is I can be because I believe this the man taught this is the one that taught them the Bible you know what I mean cuz I believe this is the Bible you say you got to line these two up you know you don't have to line up nothing this is the Bible what the prophets said is the word but are we gonna believe it and we'll pull it back up we'll get on to that's what the message is go go into all the world and preach the gospel you know that's could be you going down to your neighbor that's what I'm saying we're not getting and we're looking for something well we're we're doing the best we can up lutely we send so many thousands of dollars every month to missionaries I will praise God I thank God for that we have that to be able to do that but it might be your next-door neighbor that needs it might be your children that needs it that's kind of what he's talking about waiting on us the dying were wrong preach the gospel not make organizations build denominations be a big building sometimes that's all right ain't got nothing again but it ain't what Jesus said he never said go make organizations go build big churches big buildings he said preach the gospel what is the gospel the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit aren't the gospel that's what we ought to be dealing or wanting to watch the conjunction and conjunction ties the sentence together see these signs shall follow them that believe going through the next one we got a little bit of time left there's been a dispensation of well there was a dispensation in the Mosaic law there was a dispensation of the John the Baptist there was a dispensation of Christ there's a dispensation of the church organization there's dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit I want you now as the dispensation of adoption what the world's waiting groaning that's according to Romans 8:23 right through that that the whole world is waiting on the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God I've always said if you get a fire burning you're gonna attract the attention right people gonna come see what the fires about well if we want a revival let's act like one if we want to get it closer to God let's act like we're closer to God let's live like we're closer to God let's be like we're closer to God okay sorry now the dispensation of adoption what's the world what the world's waiting groaning and when the fullness of time comes when the dispensation of the fullness of time what is the fullness of time when the Dead Rises what's the autumn of the end of all of our trauma when sickness seekers when all the earth ceases to groan the fullness of the dispensation of time what is it to be what's God waiting on you adoption time okay come on let's go ahead to the net this is the mystery what's the mystery of God's will now it's not just a little thing then it's a mystery God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or her self God's mystery the reason I brought that in is for me and you you gotta find your place okay you women you don't have to worry about preaching right come on use down through there and the people that what I wonder whether I'm call to preach or not you don't have to worry about it you know you're not called well I've got it I've got Matt name told me to go preach brother I still ain't gonna argue me right but what did he say he's saying gonna argue about it but he said it ain't according to the Bible all right so that finishes you don't have to worry about it so your sisters here to ease today the brothers have to worry right they're called to preach that's just natural story me that's just a natural point that I'm trying to get you to see the mystery of God's will is to adopt you and I into his family bringing us into the family as the children of God God's waiting on you and I adoption time when he can pour into us his fullness I'm quoting turn around and raise the day that we go in a rapture God's waiting on you and I waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God think that's what the world waiting on come on waiting on you and I garden let's go through the nation waiting on you and I'll bet it's got the whole bunch of them if you want to listen if you don't then just cut it off okay my point is is to get us to see if you don't get a point out of anything the brother branham is a firm believer in God waiting on you and I he evidently was because he does a lot of talking about it you know so evidently it's putting up on the basis of what we are okay the believers position in Christ now we're groaning waiting for that time of adoption and we believe that one of these days the Holy Spirit will move in not with a new birth while we receive that through Christ but you'll adopt your church then then she'll be cold and the power of the resurrected Lord you pray and things and pray that you'll do all that he's saying we pray that you'll adopt us now Lord into your family give us the authority that we need father to make the gainsayers keep stealing we should pray for that not pray for great gifts and signs and wonders I never pray for God I don't know one brother used to come here and then it hurt but I'm sorry but I used to tell him I said brother I pray for God not to do nothing when you're here boiling that really what do you mean brother you pray for God to not do something when I'm here I see you because you'd go out and advertise it to the world and this building to be slapped for him we got to build on two or three times but I said then you be gone you wouldn't be here you understand what I was getting at he wasn't the one to come in he just get everybody else to come he'd be gone I said I pray for God to not do anything while you're here because you've got the wrong idea I'm not trying to get you to come to this church to be anything other than one time be what God has called you to be if it's a deacon be a deacon if it's a minister be a minister if it's a housecleaner be a housecleaner whatever God has called you for do that if it's a few warmer you know I mean if there's something to said I'll do it believe it find your place your position give us the authority that we need father to make the gainsayers keep still give it to us right I'm praying now a prayer that I never prayed before I'm praying for God to move on the scene in the church at Lula in a way to either empty the building or fill it up you understand what I mean by that we had a couple of little incidents in the couple of ministers that used to be in the church here with us well I didn't tell this for a long time because it's embarrassing and I put a prayer cloth underneath where they were sitting my prayer was not to get rid of them but get them to make up their mind what they wanted to do whether they could do whatever you don't understand me I wasn't trying to get them to leave I didn't want them to leave I had no reflection to them leaving I wanted them to make up their mind with I could get in with what we were doing or get out they got out and you know what I mentioned that one time and somebody and I know it was somebody looked under that Pew and took out my prayer cloth well I just went a little further over in the seat and put one where they couldn't find a second but you know after it was over with people saying brother the hell did you put one where I'm sitting you know I make sure I took him out because I didn't want no reflection but my point was not nothing against anything I wanted those two brothers to make up their mind whether they wanted to walk in the word that we were trying to preach our to get out on her own and go that's fine no problem but I'm just saying if you want something doing after the service is over turn around look you might find something sticking underneath you but we're having problems now and I don't mean wrong problems worse Jowan all right Joe brother sister Glenn's not here today well I guess the tickle of him I look over here one time there's Joe and when I look over here large oh and when I look over here neither John win because so many people coming in and do it and they just pick the seats and that's behind well it'd be hard to try to put one under your seat brother Joe you keep moving too much all right you said well that's stealing now I want you the one thing that I've always wanted it's not a big church we could afford a big church we could call in our giving as to what we've done we could have a big church all right but we're always built on as we had to then we could have had things paid for we could do it now and how things paid for but that's not what I'm on desire is my desire is to have a people that believed Huns word and accept it for themselves and listen to what's being said of these ministers that come in I try to find ministers that are related to what I'm thinking you know the you know my joy is to try to get the people to see Christ living you know and look at the last five or six ministers that come in besides our local ministers and what they're doing look at the ministers has come in they're all been into that back to the people getting to become the word and believing it and well that's a joy in my heart I want the church to come to a place to where that they can be what God wants us to be right they don't make no difference what we are we've always just come to be what we could try to be but I want a church that this not just say it's on fire with God hey I'm a human being I'm a human being I know that's sitting in that seat gets hard on that bottom no first thing we gotta sit down an hour or hour and a half or something with us to talk and I'm a human being I realized those things I realized that the way that I preach and want to do I demand that you understand or you listen or you go home and think about it at least think about what I'm saying well what his brother Dale say it he's saying that God has depended on us I always thought I've depended on him I didn't say that I'm saying brother Branham there's the one that's saying no son that God is waiting on somebody to just to stand up and say I believe it well I ain't never seen it before don't work you might be the woman that needs to just be saying it okay all right you understand what I'm getting at not an uber we got that but an adoption okay let's see if I can find a wonder but around said I don't see nothing outside of the coming of the coming the Lord accept the readiness of the bride alright the readiness of the bride they got it up I don't see anything to hinder at this time the coming of the Lord Jesus outside of the readiness of his church he said now that's a prophecy well you know what if it's a prophecy somebody's going to fulfill it why can't we believe we're the ones that's why we're not arguing about this church over here and what they're saying today I ain't Spence let these services to try to denounce these brothers that are going this way I mention it yeah because I don't want you to get tied up into some of those things but I don't spend messages I was trying to prove that they're wrong hey if you walk away from this message you're already wrong it shouldn't be that we have to tell anybody they're wrong if a man comes out like brother wrestler man comes up and says brother Branham wouldn't Malachi forward okay we've got that soft now who is because the Bible says it's got to be well who is she didn't come find out you want to say to the person are you trying to say you're it because you say you found brother branham wrong if you find brother branham wrong then you have it in there must be closer to garden brother branham water ain't talking silly I'm talking plain language that's why I don't spend my time to onto those things let them do what they're gonna do the only thing you'll ever get me to see is that if they ever come forth and say will you sign paperwork saying this out of the other I said get out of your paperwork who do you agree with they tried to put me in Everett camp in this want to come in it when the two souls of two Lords or seven Thunder virtuous or produces the you know all the doctrines they tried to put me in the camps and it couldn't do it first sermon I preached right here in this building I'm going beyond man's camp I still believe that today let's go beyond our own thoughts and ideas of what something is and get into the message of the hour that the Prophet has already brought to us we don't need to find another message we don't need to find some other prophet we don't need somebody to straighten this prophet out we need to believe it we need to accept what he says when he says that's what you are why can't I let me at least say he said I was he's talking about me let me at least believe that because he's waiting on I've got a whole lot more in here to do it but usually gets the notes and didn't have them God is waiting on you and me adoption time when he can pour in his fullness and the baptism and curious in the resurrection and rapture alright God's been patient he's been waiting 50 years I'm just using that as an illustration back to in the Prophet left are we closer to the Lord today than we was 50 years ago if we're not we're back slid okay what you say Wednesday I ain't back to it if you ain't closer to the Lord didn't you watch 10 years ago your back fluid where you going neighbor one way Oh God kept trying to tell me some things that he but he kept telling me and he said Lord told me to go north I said praise God go north he said go to little I so good you're going north one day he come he said Lord told me to go south I said now I ain't never told you nothing ain't never said nothing contrary to what you tell me but I'm gonna tell you now you're out of the word he's what the Lord told me I said when you went the promised land according to my understanding you could go into land you could go north and south or ever which one falls on but you can't come back out and I said my emphasis is you can't go in the promised land and go back out so you're admitting yourself that you're out of the word well you didn't like them that's all I wouldn't be in dark dogmatic I was just telling the truth you can go to the this way or that way or straight ahead but you can't go backward now don't start with me to try to emphasize those things because I'm game enough to talk to you about it I know what happened with the two-and-a-half tribes that went back out but there's one thing about it they went in the land and got their possession and they fought for everybody else that was - meant for them the house to be done ain't talking about me and you you can't come into this message and back out of it you get in this message you just gotta what did he call that I never did understand it but a penny arcade's you could go in and you just look at all of the things you know we can come in this message we can come on this issue you can just look and you just got a wonderful way of going in the message to study and and read and things like that but don't try to go out of it you're going back to denominationalism go forward turn northward the Bible says brother Branham didn't go backward he went forward you can't do that but get one of my whole point one God is waiting if you don't get nothing I've emphasized them by doing all cared a little furthermore God is waiting on you and me to stand up and say who we are I would be willing ain't saying I'm gonna do it I'm not saying with others no I'm just saying I would be willing to go down to the Atlanta Constitution and print a first page and pay for the whole paper to give me every page in the paper to say I don't agree with the way these people are do and brother branham never taught no junk like that would you I'd be willing to go pay for the whole paper if they just let me have the whole paper let me just blast it but what good would it do that's just my point is I'm just showing you how much that I believe it and where did I stand on it you said well don't don't do that cuz they get them after me hey they're after us anyway don't worry about it if we're talking about yesterday or us talking about it we was you know when they click that off in there one day because I put a title to a sermon the examining yourself they clicked us off the internet that's how close they are they clicked it off and brother Joe had to talk to them and explain them that the Bible we're talking about examine yourself what it's the where you're in the faith or not they put us back home that's how close it is they don't have to have anything to do they're listening to everything you know what I say praise God you know you said well we're brother Dale do you think they might have a hookup in your house and listened to everything you do I hope they do I hope to have it because in that maybe they're gonna hear a little bit of the truth well you're crazy I agree with you but I love the Lord I love his word and I believe his word but I believe it's the point that I've always been it's one thing I believe it in a positive present-tense God the word I am means ever-present for eternity that's just your profits definition of the word I am I am means ever-present for eternity I believed in a God before coming this message I believed in a living God I served a Living God but I just didn't know who he was and what it was in his word I couldn't understand because we were just told we've done the best we could do but see today there's no God different it hadn't brought a different God to me it's brought the god of the word I believe in near live world the god of the word living in me and you manifested itself in our hearts and life to let other people see the Christ that you have in your life okay let's stay well we got brother Joe [Music] anybody have a name Amen word [Music] the answer to all things first well if your understanding come to it in all of these times are happening to try to bring out around all those might be
