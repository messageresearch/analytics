Central Baptist Church he passed away a couple weeks ago and they cremated the body so we're gonna have a per her wishes a memorial service on November the 11th so now we got all those out of the way left turn revelations 10:1 and today we're going to recap and have comments because when you get into the to the groove of this it's like brother Dale said you you brother Ryan read it this morning actually brother Branham stated he would go sit down next to a tree and said he would just meditate remember he'd go squirrel hunting but he actually took the pencil in a piece of paper he'd sat down beside a tree he said now when a revelation would come something from God would come 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 2 is 4 but what it was it wasn't that he was adding 2 times 2 is 4 he was it comes in a sequence it comes to 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 2 is 4 2 times then and it really flows but some times 2 times 2 don't always equal 4 when you're trying you gotta bump up against the wall so this week I was been bumping up against the wall trying to get to Revelation chapter 5 but knowing that maybe we had some visitors with us that we needed to back out so brother direct this is for you the rest of you can sleep you and your family can pay attention to this and well but no and that's the way the Lord works the Lord's not going to take off and not give you a chance to catch up hey man he's just not because he's just a good guy he's a good god that will us like said remember the the 90 and 9 he left in the fold just to go get the 1 ma'am alright so he went out to get the 1 and then we're going to back up today and just Greek out have some comments at the end and then next Sunday will the Lord willing we'll start with Revelation chapter 5 so revelations chapter 10 verse 1 let's pray before we get started the Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you would be with us today in our speech and our hearing Lord and all the things that go on we've sang the songs of Zion we've prayed we took up the offering done all the peripheral things that we're supposed to do when we come to service and now comes time lord for your word we pray that you'll do the speaking Lord you do the hearing you do the only one that can do the revealing because man cannot reveal this it has to be by the Holy Spirit father we pray that you would be with the ones that are not here all the ones that are it brother Tim hymns for the meeting they're on their way back now Lord we pray that you keep them safe bring them back Lord together in one in you here in the church Lord bless the ones that are with us today father the ones that are in the foreign fields we pray that you just be with those missionaries give them a fruit for their labor father we always think about them over there doing their work doing their job we pray that you'd give them fruit Lord for their labor father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make be with us and the further of this service Lord we give you the praise and honor and glory for all these things Lord cuz without you or nothing Jesus name we pray amen revelations 10 verse 1 we'll put the chart up in a minute and what I'll do is I'll give us some bullet points two points to ponder before we step over into Revelation chapter 5 because when we go over into revelation chapter 5 I want us to realize that we're going to have to call on a lot of things that we've heard over the years you're gonna have to call that up and you're gonna have to to bring it in and you're going to have to chew on it like like the brother was saying this morning you know you're just gonna have to chew on it you're gonna have to be like a cow that chews on that you know he he eats and he eats and he eats and then brother Larry he goes and lays down under the tree and regurgitate sitting he eats it again last way he's made well that's the way we should be made because we should be able to bring it back up to our remembrance the prophet of God told us that if we would make ourselves available that God will speak to us all right so revelations 10 verse 1 we're going to try to work into the seven seals for the next few months and we'll get to the first seal eventually but we got to have a good foundation because we've been here 50 something years since the seals have been open the greatest message the prophet of God said he he had ever if anything was inspired he said those seals were inspired we know his whole message was inspired but those seals was what his message was all about they meant cuz we're gonna read it and prove it to you in just a few minutes cuz I think maybe most of the church world II and I say Church world most of the church world of message just means that the seals were open and that was it but there is something else because that was to be for the redemption of our body to get us out of here the third pull the headstone all those great things to get our body changed and get us out of here because we're not leaving here without a body change we're not leaving here you're gonna die and go by the grave yeah but when you come up your body is gonna be changed alright I'm telling you but like the new ones I'm not looking for a rapture I'm not looking for a rapture they're actually the wraps are started on the day of Pentecost but the culmination but will be one day of a sequence of events like going to school you go to school for 12 years you get a diploma the diplomas the rapture what's the most important the diploma are the twelve years of school well you're not going to get that diploma without 12 years of school okay so the twelve years of school is the most important the most important is getting us to the place because there can't be a rapture without the voice of the Resurrection without what that same man here in Bride form with a loud voice that brought Lazarus the same voice the Prophet said that brought Lazarus from the grave well what bring those saints from Paul's age all the way up so they're waiting on you and I amen alright revelations 10 verse 1 I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire he had it in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he had cried watched seven thunders uttered their voices now man has made the thunders many things but we're going to prove what they are maybe during this not this service but during this series of services because some people thinks it's seven people and they're about all dead so it's not them God doesn't use a dead message he uses the live person to bring his message why seek ye the living among the dead all right the resurrection had to be sounded by someone that is alive and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write remember John was commissioned to write what he saw and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not in other words John was getting ready to write them so he wasn't afraid to write what he saw so it wasn't something unfamiliar to John okay and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and it liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word and I'm not leaving I'm just going back in here to get my brother Ram said we could we'd read one Scripture and go home so we're not doing do that today but there was a brother who listens in from Michigan he he's the one that sent us a gracious donation the other day and he he called me the other day and I know he's watching so brother rush you sorry I'm gonna tell in anyway he said I watched you play and for those of you that weren't here two Sundays ago this thing fell apart right we had two sister Gail so graciously I'm gonna go ahead and tell the story you okay she gave me this roll of this 200 mile an hour tape you know the duct tape she said here use this so I reached and grabbed it and when I pulled it they was that much left [Laughter] it was down to the variance she said I just knew that they was a few a few turns left but no there was that much so she gave me a big role today so maybe this thing won't fall apart but he told me he said why don't you take some of that money I sent you and buy you an easel so I guess I will go buy an easel cuz I like to do it visually cuz visual you can see what I'm talking about and you can kind of burn it in your brain and bring it up and talk about later on alright there be okay say Amen all right here we go we're gonna try to go through this and help the ones maybe that hadn't been here for a while call I like for everybody to see see means to understand right so now let's pull the first quote the first few quotes are going to be quotes that we have quoted before but I kind of condensed them and made just small little snippets of it but you know what you can go back and read it if you want to read the rest of it the layout of sand church age number one church age book now this messenger of my life 94 and revelations 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals see how he's saying it now contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so but consider this this prophet messenger will be in his nature and manner as were elijah and join the people of this prophet messengers day will be as they were at Ahab's day and gone and since then it is only the children whose hearts will be turned it is only the children who will listen all right so it's going to be the only going to be the children not just the children in age as far as human age but the what he's going to turn hearts of the children so they're the ones that's going to list them the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and then what we're going to grow in grace and knowledge together amen so this messenger then I want to make a few points I found a real good quote and I may read it if I have time about something we've been studying on and it just kind of puts a a punctuation mark all right the first point we want to make is is whoever this messenger is that we're listening to or watching has a two-part message is that Alright - he just said that I'm just reading what he said it's in two parts so you we have a two part message not two different parts as per say two different people are two different ideas or two different mindsets one message but there's two parts in that message one is what to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal father's the faith of the fathers and then reveal the mysteries of what the seven thunders now I want you to watch how he how he said that he didn't say reveal the mystery of the seven seals which is in Revelations 10 which of the revelation is contained in the seven thunders he didn't say that he said he said well he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals that all right and then he will reveal those mysteries that are in the seven thunders mm all right okay because we don't get into something because remember for those of you hadn't been here for a while this is the way the scroll looked alright it wasn't a book the seven sealed book of redemption didn't look like this now I got a quote where brother Branham said only about five or six hundred years ago did they start making books like this all of your books then the old in the old testament the old scrolls were look like this what was written was inside here this is the seven seals you can take seven of these or one make one this is the seal right this is the seal this is what had it sealed up there's a mystery there sure but that's something different from this it's actually a good quote in there but that's what the mysteries contained in the seven seals which were the thunders of the voice of God and many times I think that we've taken this the mystery of the seal and went with it when this is what had it locked this is what had it locked so man couldn't see it sure this was the white horse rider which was the Antichrist that man said was the Holy Ghost property God what breaks the seal gives us the revelation but there's still a mystery there's still something written in the book because the seals had the book sealed that all writes amen cuz remember if he's got two parts to do then there should be two parts of this the breaking of the seal and the mystery of the thunders I got some I got some water thank you John and watch now number two we were we were going through this on questions and answers on the seals and like I said again to background everything that we've been talking about so this is a two-part message now the second thing I want to talk about is when he come up to the questions and answers on the seals but he told him he said now pull it up on screen make sure I see you're doing that where's my quote oh it's Kern what number two we're okay we're working here that okay we're working we're at working progress that's okay thank you brother Kern conscious lost his mind he's gonna be a dead end he's already lost don't try to make yourself odd to be a Christian because you see it you take yourself away from God and you if you can understand that this is that third Pole you should have caught that the other day now remember they didn't because watch you remember there'll be no impersonation like there was the other two see so that's as far as you know you should know now just just remember that you see now there's something taking place in this room there's something here there's actually in this room angels voice of God but how do you you can't if you can't hear the natural voice without something to send it out how are you going to hear the spiritual voice now you might make believe that somebody is singing this certain song that might not even be there but when it actually strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike then it gives a true interpretation and vindicates it by showing the picture see what I mean now then number two is that it must be for a special group of people it was not for them remember he said this is not for you you're not here you're not even going to get this it's not for you it's gone from you amen so there must not be somebody that was sitting in that congregation that was in tune with what was coming than alright because it's for another group it's for someone else is for a special group of people what one that was what we were talking about in tune now what were we talking about the crystal he just said he says when what he said when it strikes the crystal and all of you know that that you're old enough to know some of you kids will look cross-eyed at this but there used to be little diamond crystals inside of a radio we've turned into the digital age and it's not there anymore it's all circuit boards and all that but when I was growing up you had a m55 and you had a m-715 you had just 1260 and that's about it where there was a certain crystal in there and that crystal come from the radio station and that radio station had a certain tune to it and you couldn't pick up a m55 when your dial was at 750 you picked up a m 750 because that's what that crystal said when you turned it that dial to where it was supposed to be that's what you picked up exactly what was coming so there was a special group of people coming there was a group sitting there that know by no means are we d Christianizing anyone but there in 1963 they didn't have a clue what he was talking about ask me questions just on the seals and they asked him about wearing pantyhose and pajamas to listen he didn't need a revelation all the other news read the questions knowing they wasn't getting what he was talking about but he said it's not for you it's gone from you but right around the coming of the Lord bringing in another quote this these things are going to be made known so they weren't for that group of people it was only for a group of people that was in tune arm we'll get to this in a minute pressurized this group that I'm talking about is the only group that's pressurized to take what's coming most others will not take what's coming it's not for them but this two-part message is for a group of people that get both sides not just one than all right you look quiet today but that's okay you can listen if you say man if every once in a while it keep you awake maybe but now look what we're talking about is is we're talking about a message that the Prophet said I have never worked in this realm I have never worked in this in other words in this much anointing I have never worked in my life seen thousands of people healed seen hundreds of people receive instant healing he's seen probably hundreds of thousands received the baptism of the holy ghost many raised from the dead many great things even even speaking the third pole even before this time because remember the the squirrels and all that was but in 59 and 60 so he he had already been through that he had already experienced this and he said now working the room I've never worked before and then we're supposed to stay here and go boy it was a good message that's what they were saying in 1963 that's why he said they weren't getting it cuz they were sitting there going God send a prophet and that's okay that's the foundation that's something to work with but he told him they weren't getting and told them it was gone from him that they were not gonna get it the old ones had to go because they weren't in another age they were in in that Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen not false they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost they lived a good clean life listen brother branham I'm telling you again he did not come to bring us a good life these people live the life before he got here so he didn't come sure he had to bring that because what that was two loose ends man he said it's okay to cut your hair man instead okay god never said it but man said it was okay to do this man said it was okay father son Holy Ghost baptism it was okay to do this but he he lined that back up but that's what they had the first church age 2,000 years ago that was the first part of the message for the prophet of God to come on the scene and by the Holy Ghost bring us back to the faith of the father's one true and living God no eternal hell what you didn't happen you didn't have to preach that to Peter Paul they were the ones reaching it amen but they couldn't bring the headstone the headstone was missing and then that's the second part he had to come the first part why I read it in a minute was restoration the first part was to restore the gift to restore what divine healing sure to restore Lord Jesus Christ baptism to restore no eternal hell I was just reading in a few minutes ago eternal security that's when I told you I really like that I know if I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost today if I'm born again I'll never have to stand judgment that just blesses my soul buddy let me tell you because other denominations go well we all gotta stand judgment no we don't we've passed that we pass from death unto wine why we've been pressurized to take what's coming we've been in tuned to take what's coming we are a special group of people I'm supposed to be teaching they're not preaching so stop it all right here we go watch this number 3 but remember let's go back to number 2 because when it actually starts strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike right here when it nicely strikes the crystal that is supposed to strike well then that tells me one thing there is a place that it will strike the right crystal the right crystal in the right station will be what lined up in tune and ready in tune and ready to hear what God has already said not something that's coming it's already been said the days of the voice the seventh angel now number three now watch 1961 now we turn quickly because I know there's a baptismal service what is this Seventh Seal book oh what a great thing did you notice how it says here it was seven seals on the back of the book it's something Oh may God help us now and give us courage maybe sooner or later I can get to you get it to you look this is not written in the word it's sealed on the back of the word the book was sealed by the seven seals now look the seven seals are on the outside the book the mystery is on the inside book the thunders is on the inside of the boat just like I told you on the inside the book outside the books are sealed all right now watch the whole mystery of the book is sealed up in these seven seals this is the one of the most greatest chapters Nate on my revelations chapter five this is one of the most greatest chapters in the whole Book of Revelations look I saw him to write him him selling a throne a book written within and written on inside that's what we're reading this morning in the backside sealed with seven seals outside the Bible what the Bible doesn't even say now let's stop right there for a minute you can't bring some other interpretation it see what he's saying this is what he's saying he's saying just like with with one true Living God the whole Bible the whole Bible is built on one true Living God amen but now what is man done took the same Bible and proved the Trinity God never put that in the Bible that never was even in the mind of God he knew that was what was gonna happen but it never was written in the Bible so this is what he's talking about there's not the seven thunders are not written thunder number one thunder number two thunder number three that's what he's saying he's not saying it's not in the book this is outside the Bible what the Bible doesn't even say because we remember what some people took that and said oh brother branham you can write a 24th chapter of Revelation he said it sounded good he said but you can't add one word or you can't take one word I hope amen that's what we're looking at though it's sealed with seven seals the mysteries of God now what is it now notice well man no notice a sail represents a finished product something that has been already tested proven and then sealed we have the earnest of our salvation now by being sealed with the Holy Spirit that is the earnest of our salvation now like I said before I'll tell you for them look for the other one my brother Brown talks about the boxcar you got to put all the stuff in the boxcar just right and then what there's a seal put on it until its destination now watch more important the seal or watch it in the car what's in the what uh what's in the cars more important cuz you put a seal on an empty car but it's not the right kind of seal cuz that thing's proves to seal and say this is not to be open until it reaches its destination because what's inside so you after even putting a line because what's inside is gold silver sixteen elements of the earth actually you and I potash that's what sealed this sealed what then what does God do God at the end of the journey he opens the thing up and he goes how'd this get here it's empty I thought he spoke to me full I thought you supposed to be filled up and then seal fill me up Lord and then seal me our problem is is we go ahead and slamming Oracle's we think we're ready we think we're ready but when God tells us we're ready when we're in tune and we're pressurized we will it will come out if you plant a tomato seed it's going to bring Tomatoes and then that's why you got to plant the right kind of seed so this is one of the greatest chapters in the Bible that were coming up to in Revelation chapter 5 he'll say here in the minutes the most sublime scripture in the Bible did you tell me what he said was the most important scripture in the Bible come on should know that you've been here a long time Daniel 9:24 it's the most important scripture in the Bible that revelations 5 is the most sublime scripture and right those are the two scriptures that you have in the Bible amen number four now we find out that this number four we find out that this was sealed with seven seals and each seal was wrapped around as was the revelation came forth look he pulled the seal and undone this and read what the seal said then he undone the next the scroll and read what the seal said undone the next one and pulled it out to see what the seal said and what the revelation was that's exactly what our seven seals that we're going shortly into we trust each seal when it took off the book will be unrolled and look and that will show exactly what's taking place all right so that's what the seals are going to show us exactly what's taking place not pursuing because look we have another point that we'll want to make it say it was hidden now we're listening it was sealed from mankind it was sealed from mankind because there's only a special group of people that's going to understand this do you understand what I'm saying it's not for a generation past us it's not for a generation ahead of us it's for you and I'm telling you Church I didn't bring that one but I brother branham in 1953 he says something's coming to this church I'm telling you today something's coming to this church there's a group of people that's gonna take this thing and start believing it and you know what not just believing that it was for somebody else believe it for yourself cuz you got to make it personal you got to make it personal you got to make it yours you naughty men revelations 5 I'm I am I'm in Revelations 5 I don't know whether you are or not but I know I am I know he and he took that book he took me that alright we'll get into that in Revelations 5 but listen we got to get through this I got 18 quotes I'm like Ryan this morning Ryan had where I had way too many quotes for 30 minutes I promise you that but he got through them now look verse number 5 the breach now notice the seven seals holds the mystery of the book until we can see what those seven seals has sealed in look seven seals has sealed in we're only presuming these things now let's going down to the red letters seven seals on the book has the these seven seals has the book sealed see the book is absolutely sealed do you see it the book is absolutely a sealed book until the seven seals is broken it is sealed up with seven seals read there right there now that's different from the seven thunders I just proved it here's the seal here's the Thunder sorry broke it broke the sails are broke this is the seal this is the Thunder it's two things so we got to get the revelation of this to get it off we got to know brother Laird we got to know that it wasn't just the holy ghost it wasn't the holy ghost it was who had it sealed the white horse rider the Antichrist is the one that said no you can't understand that let me let me get you a pope and he'll tell you what's inside the book no it's not private interpretation it's for you and I amen so the seal is a mystery the seal holds the mystery shows how had it hidden so the thunders are different now the thunders are what the Thunder is what the voice of God so we see that now if brother Branham had a two-part message then there's two parts down here number one is the seal number two is the thunders mm you got the seal and you got the thunders that's what the mysteries contained in the seven seals all right that all right say man all right but now what is it what is this look at number six still in the breach paragraph 142 wait a minute I'm sorry I'm gonna finish with this go back to leave out right there stop boat currently been alone now that's different from the seven thunders see this is the seven seals on the book and the book will not the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel not the first part we talk about the second part now the seals were not revealed until the messenger of the seventh churches began to sound his message and we'll read it in just a minute not in the ears preparation not in the years of the healing campaign no that's the first part the first part was what faith of the fathers what restoring everything back to where it's supposed to be where it had been before number two he's going to what literally take us to the headstone this is not the headstone right the church agents didn't have the headstone remember his head was cut off memory was cut off sure there's a body there there's a body there was a body of believers but the headstone Christ himself was not back in power like he was when he walked ashore to Galilee soon as he died rose ascended came back onto that Pentecost that began the church that began the bride right that began the bride that's his body they died under the revelation of the Son of God upon this rock I'll build my church and then and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it that all right but that's not the headstone the headstone had not come he was rejected I'm I'm quoting your prophet and I'm quoting you the Bible the Bible said the headstone was rejected he had to become the chief of chief Cornerstone to get his starting back again but even when Paul was still alive Paul said grievious wolves are already among us what's grievious wolf false doctrine false doctrine was already among the church turned in what away from the faith of the fathers Peter never taught three God's Peter never taught eternal hell Peter never taught me he never taught in women could cut their hair he never talked to women he never taught that that wasn't even in their vocabulary they didn't even know why denomination was that's why Paul would call it grievious Wolf's not Baptist Methodist Presbyterian pinnacles whatever and listen let me give the one more thought they had their time goes through the church ages the Baptist had their time the Methodist had to chime the presbyterian there'll be a lot of those people in the bride that alright but not now we have moved away from the church ages we have moved away from these things to what now that's different from the seven thunders this is seven seals on the book and the book will not the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel so we are presuming but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding and vindicated truth Amen sounding and vindicated truth now that's exactly what the word said the mystery should be finished at that time and this this seven sealed book remember it was closed in Revelation fifth chapter and revelations the tenth chapter it's open that's what we're fishing again - now remember look I want to bring something in here before we go a little bit further if we look at this plan of redemption Satan is Satan is not included in Redemption only the redeemed are only water only the predestinated the prophet of God said are considered in Redemption so how can breaking a seal showing that the seal was a Antichrist spirit that's not redemption Christ revealed it's the plan of redemption listen Satan has a cause and effect in this in the garden it was a cause and it's been in effect all the way down but listen the plan of redemption is what I'm telling you everybody says well the seals reveals the devil I'm gonna read you about nine clothes not today but later on we're brother mom said this is the plan of redemption not the plan of the devil we know what the plan of the devil is to stop the plan of redemption so realizing that the wild horse rider was the Antichrist it's not going to change our body but realizing that that seal has opened and there's something underneath that seal that's going to raise us up to a place that we've never been raised before there's your plan of redemption there's where your body cause look justification was not just taught in this church an angel sanctification was not just taught in this church aid the baptism my holy ghost has been since the day of Pentecost so that's not a new doctrine but brother Branham came and places him right were they supposed to be now who in the world ever taught that Judas was sanctified it takes it took a prophet to tell you that Judas was sanctified that's what he said he was sanctified remember sanctified is what clean and set aside for service but you can turn right around and be the devil himself because Judas did mm but you can't receive the baptism a Holy Ghost and be Judas no way you cannot be God and Satan in you at the same time in your soul that's a mystery that you and I are in tune with just like brother Dale was talking this morning they a lot of false doctrine in this message listen we're not gonna go out of here on false doctrine it's got to be the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding and vindicated truth amen perfect in that sounding and vindicated truth now exactly what the word says the mysteries will be finished at that time now we're gonna go and see what the book says about how it become open and it's not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book listen you got to break the seal before you see what's inside the book the seals not the book it seals on the book they've Satan sure Satan had a part he sealed it God didn't God didn't seal he wants to reveal but Satan's hid it for all these years he's hid the revelation so it's not something new how many of you come from denominations okay if you come from denominations then you read the same Bible and baptize them in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost right did you change the Bible to come into this message no you just read it with different eyesight that's exactly what we're doing everything we listened the prophet of God said raptured faith lies in these tapes and books it just takes you and I to hood be in tune and be pressurized and then to see what not the plan of the devil but the plan of redemption it's the plan of redemption is going to get us out of here towards the revelation contained in those seven seals number six the briefs now revealed as the seals breaking our release to us then we can see what this great plan of the devil is oh what'd I miss oh it's this great plan of redemption you say you're smart le brother branham's done that three or four times in the sermon you remember and he'll read stuff and they'll say oh no that's not what is this see what then we can see what this great plan of redemption is and when and how it's going to be done it's all hidden in this book of mystery he'll hear it's sealed up with seven seals so look the seals are the plan of redemption the full plan of redemption amen the book of redemption listen Redemption was over at Calvary redemption was actually over for the world ever begun but at Calvary the price was paid there had to be a kinsman not a not a spirit there had to be a kinsman they had to look for a kinsman redeemer somebody that was the same as us that's why that Melchizedek was God Almighty in human flesh but he was not your Savior no no he couldn't save you in that form he was the priest he was not a baby grew up become a man that's our brother no Cassady was not our brother it was a body created step to anybody look now that's not the way you can't it's why Jesus Christ had to come to way he did perfect kinsman redeemer come right down the line they even told him he was born of fornication he told them he was born wrong they thought he was born the way we were just a little bit off he was but not the way they thought that's all right but watch let's go to number number seven no no no no what's down six sorry I'll mess you up who can break down the seven seals got the mysteries of God from the foundation of the world all sealed up in there and revealed by seven different seals that if God willing let him let us pull back the seals now look pull back the seal look down not what we've done in the message we pulled the seal off and we're over here looking at the seal that's already been revealed as soon as he said that was the Antichrist and proved it that's exactly what it is but we can't do this there's a mystery there's something written in the book that lad had never shined on remember we told you about the junior Jackson vision he said he whipped the top off and looked down and said they was my glass somebody's not sitting on the front row I give my baptism today but rip the top off and what rip the top off and said what that was words in there but light had never shown you know what the greatest book ever written on the face of this earth in a dark room is useless that was fresh I just got that the greatest book put the Bible out in a dark room ten years later hundred years later you're still going but when light shines on it when light shines on listen it always was there it just took some light shining on it for you to see it and man that's the way that what brother Brown whipped that top off and he didn't say words appeared he said there was words written he said light shone on it had never shone on it before why he was sooo but when he broke the seal the light shined on the pages and the Bible the prophet said became a brand-new book I don't know imma hollering today y'all keep you awake I guess the whole thing here the seven seals got to mission to God from the foundational world all sealed up in there revealed by several different seals that if God willing let him let us pull back those seals and look down through the book that's a capital B so I won't think that's Greer's almanac that would be the Bible and find out what it's all about oh I hope we have a great time there the mystery of redemption is sealed until this book could not be broken until the last angels message the scrolls there we knowed it was there we know what it that it was Redemption we believed it was Redemption the prophet of God always knew the bye was just the plan of redemption but he had never seen it like you said it after the seals broke light had what never shined on him but when that mighty angel came down in revelations 10 when that mighty angel came down and shine that light on that book the Bible became a brand new book the thunders uttered their voices all right number 7 questions and answer number four this is convert or turn doctrine this was after the seals have the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed that's a question were they revealed in the seven seals but are yet not known to us as the thunders yet no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about they was to reveal the seven thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but was forbidden to ride it like I said John was what told to write what he saw right he saw the super plan of redemption because you know what John didn't put in his commentary he said now I don't know what this is no he was immediately beginning to write it down why it wasn't something unfamiliar to John but John wasn't what in tune and pressurized to take it at that time so God said seal it up and I'm going to what but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound that's why that buts there but the seven angel but the seventh angel in the day of it sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh church age see the bay all right say ma'am so the thunders were hid in the seals not something I you I read you where it says no they're different now they are they're different but it's not that the seal is way over here and the thunders is out of the Bible or the the seals in the Bible and thunders out of the Bible no it's just that the seals are seal 1 this happened seal two it's written in the Bible seal - this is what happens seal 3 so for still 5 sissies right but the thunders are not and the first Thunder sounded and and the second no but listen it's got to tie the whole Bible together and there's only one thing that's common in all the Bible Redemption the Bible was written so that a group of people could be redeemed saved whatever what do you want to say right it was written for the foundation of the world why because God saw a group of people that would need it listen how are you gonna get redeemed how did you get redeemed hide your soul get redeemed reading the comic book just so get redeemed in a beer joint well some my mother but anyway you had to hear the word of God it wasn't you heard you buddies getting you another Miller Lite got it so what was it it was something that came out of the Bible that's why I love my favorite scripture Genesis 1:26 is my favorite scripture that's why I hinge my salvation on is that I am part of that Genesis 1:26 man because if at Genesis 1:26 man never died never had a bad thought never fell then I'm in pretty good shape I just got to get this guy the second part of the revelations got to be revealed the first parts already been revealed because if you're sitting here today and you're hearing the Word of God and if it is what quickened in your heart you are receiving the Thunderer revelation that no one else has ever received listen we can hardly talk to other message people besides worldly people besides the nomination people how long you think you can talk to people bro Kali how long not long right so what so you're a mystery you're the greatest mystery that ever was you're the hidden mystery that dick Addison and a mark action rock can walk through life be a born again child of God and walking in the most dark age that was ever on the face of the earth you think the Dark Ages were dark it was dark because why because they killed them physically but now they're dying spiritually you can't talk to anybody hardly without what crossing them bring a quote Micah now let's go to number eight and I will ask you a question and what we're going to do is we're going to read number eight and nine and number eight is this a silently in sir the mysteries he's some of the mysteries in the Bible here's the mystery a mystery of Scripture listen we've read scripture all my life right okay Bab just read it a different way than we do Methodist read it a different way than we do okay is a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed the property God come and brought what restoration back from father son Holy Ghost all the all the new eternal hell brought them back line them up right divinely revealed but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation despite the revelation there's a mystery involved same scripture not different not a different revelation but to Revelation with light on him that word would light on it that had never shined before that all right that's my brother Brown preached God in simplicity what's the simplest thing in the world plan a Redemption to me is the simplest thing in the world and brother Branham brought justification right down the way it should be there should be no question he brought sanctification down the way it should be he brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost the most simple thing to me as a plan of redemption but people in this message do away with all that and they say oh you believe the message you're you're born again you gotta be born again you believe the message that God will believe that's messy he got here for you didn't he'll leave after you do he knows brother Brennan was a prophet he was a spiritual he's a spiritual guy remember saying the spiritual guy he's not some dummy remember brother Brown said what God's getting ready to do something for you he said watch Satan will feel like and what step in front he sees it and feels it before you do it's like who was it Wednesday night Aaron you start getting a revelation from God somebody you ain't heard from in 20 years will call you on the phone the kids that have never bothered you before decide to repaint their bedroom they decide to go outside and put butter on your car something goofy why that's nothing a little kid phones to devil's fault the devil hates revelation I'm quoting the Prophet if you don't know that Satan hates revelation cuz he knows if he can keep us from revelation what's he been keeping him from down to the search ages he's been keeping what even the child of God from the fullness of that what they're supposed to be amen I'll guarantee you this would be strange to Martin Luther for about 1 or 2 sermons but after about 1 or 2 sermons guess what that holy ghost inside Martin Luther oh say that's why that said that that's why that said that that's why that said that that's why and he would be running these I was begging for he said I saw the just shall live by faith I was looking through a keyhole I was just seeing just a little bit but oh man there's a roomful there's a roomful of Revelation in here that's what the Holy Ghost is all about hey man so now let's take our two parts and we'll be finished in a second now sorry won't be finished in a second everybody knows what this is right we've already drew this one time there's your candlestick there's your church ages right and head the dark part in the light part in the dark part you understand that everybody got that same an all right so now we have a two part message this is the first part restoring back all that have been lost in their ages amen then you have a space got it all right you got the body you got the body but remember the body is nothing without the but remember through the church ages this was wiped out it didn't don't know what wasn't done away with what it was covered light did not shine on when listen when Christ left the scene I steamed about this other day June and I've been married 38 years last Friday's a week ago and I've seen there every day for those 38 years pretty much you know what I'm trying trying to be crude I like to touch her I like to know she's there I like to have an intimate relationship with my wife Jesus Christ when he left this earth 2,000 years ago he has never had an intimate relationship like he wants to have one people realize that he is so patient waiting ohoo me and you to get ready so I can hug us so he can fellowship with a surety fellowship but he's not in this dimension he wants a wife in his own dimension he wants a wife we can hug her we can talk face-to-face with her the problem is were why we're in this dimension of sin and death now I go quit preaching come on but it's the truth I was thinking the other day my finds seen Jim for 2,000 years I've been crazy maybe 2,000 minutes would be horrible seconds but you see that you take that and you take that by millions brother Brown said the love for your wife by millions that's just filial love what about the godly love of God that's the headstone look right here right here look that's the love that he has for us and he's tried his best to get us to see it but we're going I don't know by that I don't know ain't that right he wants to see us with his own flesh eyes he's looking now what through the blood brother devil so much that's this morning he can't see us he can't see us he can hear our voice but what about a wife and no one that she's just right there and you can't get to her until she comes to a place old people we need to come to a place we think we have joy with our spouse and our children that's nothing compared to the joy in Jesus Christ amen all right so number one he what he comes to restore the faith of the fathers all right got it and we do this last Sunday we showed you all the all the messages that he preached we're not going to see that but remember brother Branham he preaches the church ages all right then what then there's a breach between the church ages in the what the seals this is not the seals this is part two if I got that okay wake up so what we're to be birthed out of the ages I know we're supposed to be birthed out of the age but we got to be birthed completely into eternity because remember the dude raised his hand and he said what time is no longer right you know what we're looking for we're time creatures we looking at a watch now going when's it going to be quiet I got something tomorrow two o'clock appointment what about if all that went away to me that be enough to write for me right there amen to know that I didn't have to go do this and do that and fix this and fix that amen but the first part of the prophets message was what to restore us back to the faith that was right here and then bring his message let's read that let's skip oh let me read this real quick to help them in the back number nine recognize your day in this message now you say well brother Brown don't look at this I forgot this brother branham he's he's already preached to seal right seals are preached seals are preached I want to ask you a question we're talking about what a supernatural element beside the revelation that came during the time that all right because watch this is no recognizing your Danis message 1964 and then why he wouldn't let me preach them seven trumpets because brother Evans gonna preach each trumpet now he preached the Feast of the trumpets which were under the Feast of the trumpet but the seven trumpets he was going to preach them I was even ready to announce that it had the Hogs ready and everything to go into it to preach the seven trumpets and I said there's something bothering me so bad I said we kept on working and Billy and all of us trying to get everything ready for the air-conditioned building look he was what he was going to have the meeting for this next coming week for the seven trumpets having ten days or eight days had School Auditorium but the Holy Spirit wouldn't let me do it for some reason and I wondered why and when I went to pray I told the wife I'm going in and sincerely I knelt down before God to pray and he revealed to me that them seven trumpets sounded under the sixth seal and I've done preached it supernaturally go to the sixth seal and see where he did he mentions the trumpets a few times because that's to Israel but he never he never preached verbatim you got it the Holy Spirit saying supernaturally you've already preached them because all the trumpets sound under the six seals win those two prophets hit the earth go to Israel what he'd already preached him supernaturally so what am I telling you there's a supernatural element that we don't even have written on this board because that's what's holding us here so now let's get to this let's get first Corinthians let's go to number 10 win never gonna get none now look trying to do God a service 1965 watch this now he promised in the last days what he would do and it sent them us the message and this message would have the same identification as Elijah had as Elijah had as John the Baptist said and it would turn the hearts of the people not to the denomination but back to the original Apostolic fathers by to the word how these things have been of indicated in this 1965 how that in the sounding of the last angel revelations 10 the days of seven things of these mysteries have all been why did the Methodists do list the Baptist's do this Church of Christ Jehovah Witness the mysteries will be revealed in the last day when the seventh angel seventh angels message when not when he starts out doing this look at me not when he starts out doing this this is not the seventh angels message it's part of it okay it's part of the seventh angels message but that's not what he came for I'm gonna say this in shock you any prophet could preach that any prophet if he's the prophet of God comes Paul preached didn't Peter preached it right here it's just that what Satan had eroded and eat eat till it took a major profit to bring it back and then not just go off the scene he had another party had to bring mmm now watch when he begins to sound his message see not the years in preparation this is the years in preparation restoring what the body back so that the head can fit on the body amen now let's go to the next one real quick number 11 now that brings to pass today because we have faith and I know this is of God is because this and other scriptures point to this our revelations 10 said that in the hour of the seventh angels message when he begins to sound forth his message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service there's the healing service yeah sure that was physically people healed but they're what spiritually people were healed amen but that wasn't his message that was bringing us what toward to get to this breach to get over into this part of his message that all rights a man a man so now let's read number 12 notice quickly now she is in that stage beyond the shadow of a doubt we're in the Laodicean Church age now her messenger is promised in Malachi fourth chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered look now delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 they men not saying that this birth was wrong this birth was for their age this birth was what son of god revelation gates of hell champ can't prevail against them but they're all going to die because they don't have enough to get this body out amen but then you come and you see it they become a new birth and we were talking the other day about this that's been the breech birth what is a breech birth a breech birth is when the feet come first that's not a normal birth the head has to come first so he what does he do he turned us so the head could come out first it's not that these people didn't get born again right they got born again right under their time but we were we had a breech birth something couldn't happen there had to be a Malachi 4 birth that birth was this guy right here this manchild is going to change our body amen that Alright say ma'am but we're to be what delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 then you go on to birth pains and remember in birth pains there's two in the womb of the church go to number 13 then 2 today is in the womb of the church there's a great big system trying to be formed called the World Council of Churches and from the womb of the church is coming forth to children you just mark my word the word must deliver the word bride Church the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for Christ so out of the ages out of all this Paul said leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection this is perfection that all right say ma'am to save some time shaping up to a headstone number 14 - the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly into their ministry will be so close like Christ a little join him and his church together amen number 15 we have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication I believe that's true amen and how that happened number 16 with the Bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture sure that's what's going on right now the Bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour see the Bride of Christ sure she's consist of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right that's the Bride of Christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it will be so humble amen right here this is this for a special group of people we come birth right because of Malachi 4 birth if you get all the revelation under that mountain fourth birth it will birth you right cuz there's nothing wrong with this message contrary to what everybody else believes this message was the message of Jesus Christ not William Branham anyway amen because look the what the mighty angel in 10:1 came down who's the mighty angel Christ Himself the Son of Man message the message that we're supposed to get that all right a live message hey man he didn't say a bunch of dead preacher it's at a live message apostles prophets pastors teachers an evangelist for what the perfecting of the Saints are you a saint then you must come to perfection by this hey man is that Alright say ma'am one more one more thing this is going to take us right into the right into the revelations five but ever you understand what I'm telling you because because this is the foundation we've laid it's a two-part message you got to get the first part right from 1947 to 1963 brother Branham brought the word back to where the people in the church ages understood right that's a man amen all right then in 1962-63 he comes into the breech and he gets ready to what preach the seals so you got revelations one through three revelations for revelations five and revelation 6 and 8 so if you want to know what goes on rear evolutions one through three that's your church ages right revelations for John's caught up what in places never been before revelations five shows you that like brother Joel always says that the breach produced the bleach the beliefs blood of Christ but what did the bleep breach do what did the bleach blood do it turned us from a foot birth to a head birth hey man everything comes out all right then in Revelation six and eight God brings the little prophet along and he sets in and it just didn't happen in one week I'm sorry folks it was a three and a half year message of God hey man that was supposed to literally it's supposed to literally turn us back and a lot of things he preached he didn't verbatim preach him because remember he said what he said serpent seed was revealed in the seals now he preached the preceding 1959 marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals show me where he preached marriage and divorce in the seal so there must be something that was that thunder that Thunder exploding out of Revelation and nobody had ever known how in the world can a man stand and say go on as you are in other words your sins have been wiped off because of misinterpreted theology when right here this right here folks is not misinterpreted theology this straightens out misinterpreted theology because when the head was here he said it wasn't so from the beginning he never told him Paul give him a grace and brother Graham gave a grace grace Moses give a grace Jesus never gave a grace while he was on earth he said it wasn't so from the beginning he said because the hardness of your heart Moses gave you a writing of divorcement sure he's the one that did it we know that but he didn't stand there and say it's all right guys y'all just do what you won't do he couldn't do that and be the word because the word says your old husband got to be dead before you may again you're old what denominational husband better be dead so Christ can be made alive in your heart you love the Lord let's read number 17 let's get revelations 5 will start revelations 5 next thank you good job notice he's not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him that said upon the throne who was it the owner the original owner that had the book of Redemption in his right hand and no angel no angelic being nothing else to take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most sublime thing in the scripture alright that not an angel not nothing can do it and the lamb coming took it from the right hand of him that set upon the throne what was it now it belongs to the lamb hey ma'am now it belongs to the lamb and if you're born again where's that lamb somewhere out there somewhere that grandma says that they'd be sitting on a cloud he's in your heart he's the one that's speaking to you the lamb is the one that's doing the speaking because remember the Lambs the one that broke the seals hey man so now let's read this last one in the breach now what's the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit been doing he goes he inspects that's the reason you can't have these things he's talking about the inspector I spoke in tongues I shouted I danced in the spirit I don't have nothing to do with it see the Holy Spirit inspects that person until he's thoroughly satisfied and knows that they are then they are sealed unto their eternal destination there's not nothing can ever break that seal the Bible you're putting down Scripture Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit we got her by your seal until the day of redemption look what he says hold that word Redemption now this is in the breach so he's telling them hold that word Redemption hang on to that because in other words what are we fixing to do we are fixing to go over into Redemption like you never seen it before hold that word Redemption see until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and the Redeemer comes to claim his possession nothing can do it don't grieve it say don't say do things that please God for the book is sealed now and you are sealed and the Holy Spirit itself is that seal let's stand our feet musicians come listening remember brother Branham said this is that third pole remember he said he said the first - look look watch the first two can be impersonated this can all be impersonated but that can't the third pole cannot be impersonated it's what it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that no one else is gonna get no one else is going to know anything about I'll fold this thing up one of these days mmm when I can let's sing a song working for a few minutes let me read you this while he's getting ready listen this I I kind of caught this get the right one souls in prison 1963 you know we were talking the other day and this is so profound I had not seen this before that he I knew I believe this but watch but one day he rose from there came forth where was the book at now this is right after the seals 11 10 1963 soldier in prison it is still in the abstract owner God Almighty and John looked around and he wept because there was no man even worthy to look on the book and especially opened the seals to reveal what the hidden mystery was the mysteries was in the seven seals when these seven seals was opened that opened up the entire Bible and you listen to this the seven seals it was sealed with seven mysteries and in these seven seals held the entire mystery of it will read this next Sunday again and it was the book of redemption hold on man comma New Testament next paragraph not the old now look and I got to question that myself but remember the Old Testament type Redemption when when when boaz took ruth that wasn't redemption that was a type of redemption but when Christ come that wasn't a type he says look not the old it only proclaimed for the New Testament they have been made cannot be made perfect without us Hebrews 11 see see now the redemption only come when the Redeemer died and they were potentially under the blood of lambs not the Redeemer hadn't been redeemed yet until the Redeemer came so the Old Testament could not have the Holy Ghost they could not have they could not listen they're not considered in the redemption that we're considered in they never received the new birth like we received the new birth and the new birth is what's going to take us to that headstone and then they only spoke of it the blood of bulls and goats and goats covered sin they didn't do away with sin but when that cover came off at Calvary the sale what he's not but one seal and that's the baptism of the holy go that puts you in the body of Christ that's the only seal there is a man let's sing a song I'll shut up sometime what is it I'm sorry in Spanish Arabic everybody sing this song 403 get your buck out don't just mouth it get your mug out 403 into the water and been baptized I've been washing the blood I'm a change from this creature that I once was and relieve is now my name

know right before the children of Israel the old fighters died out that was a new group remember from 20 and under hey man they grew up in the wilderness but what had happened Moses had forgotten what he told them to do they were supposed to circumcise them children only eight day you're supposed to be circumcised right they walked through that wilderness and Moses forgot the commandment but Joshua the Holy Ghost quickening Joshua and something said hold it we can't go over with all this excess skin we got a circumcise we got to cut some skin off we've been in this journey for forty years we've
