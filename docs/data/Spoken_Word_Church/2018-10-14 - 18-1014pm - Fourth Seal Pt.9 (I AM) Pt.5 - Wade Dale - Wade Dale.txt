a new instrument up here got an organ a man who's gonna play that TBD TBD to be determined I'll promise you one thing it won't be me but we are brother Richard member have been brother Joe and him have been working diligently to get this thing put together so we will see how it works hopefully next Sunday maybe but bring us a little bit of bring us a little bit of we were kidding the other day you know how some of the big name preachers they have an organist sitting over there you know when he makes a point they go aren't we the smart you never know especially second service when all the sleepers are here yeah mm-hmm I just will just connect it to your bench and turn it on right yeah uh-huh good to be in the house of Lord good disabled I got to get crowned today Lord bless you let's turn into revelations six and get started have a good week this week y'all have a good week this week have a good week this week we really Lord just opened my eyes on something yes sir this morning actually no just last night and then this morning a little bit too so you get to meditating on certain things and then it takes you to other things and maybe we'll get into that but I'm telling you that we're standing this fourth seal and I I really didn't want to get to part ten I wanted to kind of continue on but still being as important as it is I think we ought to stay there till we get it finished till we get it to where we can understand it today I want to in my own feeble way and I mean that literally brother Dale has explained this for years about the son of God son of man son of David and all that and I'm gonna try to maybe draw it out a little bit kind of like he did years ago and refresh our memory just a little bit and for the new ones that are that are here that didn't get to see that cuz that was man that was like 90 80 90 80s 90s you know 80 81 82 so some of you weren't even breathing at that point so maybe we'll get to try to hit the high points today cuz I was thinking this week this week and I thought well we'll get into the son of man will you really don't understand until and I know you do because when you you ever been talking to somebody and you really know that they don't getting it or that they have questions about it and you know even in conversation with people you so when you're up here preaching you know sometimes man it flows like honey on a warm day sometimes it flows like honey on a cold day same honey but one foal it flows a little faster than the other so when we're talking about the dispensations we're going to try to maybe today show how important it is that if we don't get the son of man revelation in this hour we have missed that coming we have missed the coming of William Marion Branham we have missed his coming and why he came to deliver this message until we see what the son of man is we missed it if we don't okay now I'm not saying you missed the right drum now am i saying you missed Christianity I'm just saying you're missed what our box is what was delivered to us so let's bow our heads and try to you pray for me and I'll pray for you do you have any father we pray Lord that you'd be with us today bless your people Lord sometimes we get tired and weary and worn our mind drifts off to different things but Lord just let us focus today on one one thing and that's you Lord not not words not so much as letters on a page but let it come alive in a heart let it be something that we take with us and we'll be able to as the two from Emmaus it just burning their heart when you open the scripture to him why because you were the word you were the word Lord and you were telling them about yourself but now we know Lord that that revelation is the same here you were God in human flesh talking to the tool at Emmaus but they did not understand because they didn't have the Holy Ghost but Lord now us with the Holy Ghost in our heart the very one that wrote the word Lord we should know in our own being we should know what this words all about because the one that wrote it is now inside of the believers and we need to yield ourselves to you Lord that we will understand more Father and that there's the days go on Lord that you'll get sweeter and sweeter and that the word will become more rich Lord and all the other things of life will be just shed away father forgive us of our sins and bless this Lord take care of us through this service be ones that are sick we were the ones that are traveling be with the missionaries on the foreign fields Lord give them fruit for their labor father just bless us in Jesus name we pray amen and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see who's the fourth beast the eagle and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger with death and with the beasts of the earth you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the now let's just kind of background for a few minutes and then we'll we'll try to go through this maybe a little bit quickly and two to maybe get it in our heart and life that that we are surely in a special time this is not just if this is just if this is just going to church and this is just another church age and efficient just another then it's just another it's just another time this but it's not it it's it's not it this is when when the son of man appears on the earth he's not going to appear in his flesh he's going to appear in your flesh so you are the walking Son of Man on the earth as a collective body not as one person we know that there's no one can take the place of one man son of man except Jesus Christ himself but what did he do he transferred that to me and you that you and I have come to an end time to where where God sent a prophet that was a conduit of God that when God spoke it come through his mouth and it wasn't just for him and it wasn't basically for the ones that were listening while he was alive swine says in the days of the boys because many times we see and I've read you many times before in the sixth seal brother Branham said it's gone from you and it's not even for you but go only the same a simple Christian life that's what he was telling the people because the revelation of the Son of God was never lost in the church ages the Holy Ghost was in every church age we'll look at just a second but the son of man revelation is what was lost in the church ages name him Jesus Christ became the chief Cornerstone why so that he could I was talking to the brothers and sisters downstairs you know why didn't God just like I said before why didn't God just walk out of the tomb and just say okay devil dead all your demons are dead and I'm all my children come to life that would have been really easy but there's a journey in there why did he come up to Abraham when he come to the earth when he was in the ER Chaldees and he said Abraham get up and take a walk go on a journey right and 25 years later that came to pass that he will still have a baby well now why didn't God just say okay Abraham tomorrow I'm gonna change your body I'm gonna change Sarah's body and when you gonna have a child and everything's gonna be done that wouldn't have been the journey of Abraham that wouldn't have been the journey of the Christian same way with you and I so we have a time in our life that this this journey your your journey means something because you know what God saw your journey before the foundation of the world he saw the choices you would make and he wrote the word according he wrote the word according to what you do because you got to look back in the Bible and see you write well if you can't see your journey in the Bible then you're not in there the Pharisees remember brother Brown said the Pharisees we're blacked out one sure their names in the Bible Pharisee sad you see but if they weren't born again their names are not in the Bible their name the name that they're they're identified with it's not in the scripture you and I have an identification you and I are the bride of Jesus Christ we're not Israel we're Gentiles and God come for a Gentile bride the man so you and I have come to a place that we have we have not just we have not just come to a place to where we look back and go wow that was that was good well that was good but that's not this this is fresh meat this is fresh revelation this is what the eagle eats now remember an eagle doesn't eat you watch an old Buzzard he'll eat something's been dead for what five six seven eight ten days he don't care behind eagle you don't see an eagle crowding around touching it no it's fresh kill so you and I have to come every Sunday every Wednesday every time we pray and read our Bible and open the books we have to have fresh meat it has to be something fresh for us to eat to be to be that was the problem with Pentecost that was the problem with all them he said they what those uncle three unclean spirits like frogs what they look back and you know it was great when brother Brown was it was great when the meetings happen but like brother Dale said if we don't move off that if we don't move off that it was just all signs and wonders and it was all the discernment then we missed the message we've missed the message but remember with a message there's always a sign always there's always a sign with a message but what's more important I thought signs followed the believer not the believers following signs that was the problem with the Pentecost they got all flesh feeling good and they went off with the signs and left the message and the messenger they left brother Branham and they went for the signs you know they didn't know they didn't they didn't hear the message that was behind it so you and I have the message that's behind it you and I have the message this is what brother Branham came and gave his life for the 50 something years this right here is what he give his life for is to have a group of people sitting on the face of the earth that listens to the Word of God and gets a revelation remember what I said this morning those using them in Bible study you know we're in the fourth seal and we've been on this for almost eight months and we're just in the fourth seal and I've had ten parts on the fourth seal brother Brown preached one night the fourth seal the seal books not much bigger than this book but yet that's what's going to get us out of here so what do we have to do we have to get there revelation that's in there the revelation that's in those words it's not just the fourth seal is it's the pale horse rider no that fourth seal is the resurrection is the change of the money it's the rapture it's all the death has been destroyed death has been destroyed on that fourth seal we see death and Hell being on that scripture but they don't that's not we're not included in that we must separate ourselves that's our whole thing we have I was telling them this morning downstairs we have everything so common everything so common Israel when Israel started growing up in Egypt remember when Joseph they went down to Egypt and they started living and they started multiplying they were working for Pharaoh right they were not slaves at the time but they were working with feral then all of a sudden they got easy and they become slaves but when they become slaves feral one day says I want you to double your production I want you to do this without straw I want you to do this and you're not going to eat but one mill of dance to the three they started crying for a deliverer when that happened same way with us we've had so much ease in Zion to where I told them it's morning I said they when the parking lot full of cars there's probably a million dollars worth of cars in our little parking lot close to it if you counted them all up face value right and we were desperate that we're desperate the only thing we're desperate for is to make sure that Zaxby's has got chicken I said that cuz that's my desperation in tax means that take but in that trail I mean that's the truth so what do we you know so what are we doing we we have to see this as we've got to be prepared for something to happen Israel wasn't prepared they just got so easy down in Egypt till everything it's kind of like you know the old story that you know how to cook a frog right everybody knows how to cook a frog afraid of dad you've cooked many a turtle but I don't know if he's ever cooked the Frog yeah did he ever cook the Frog didn't think so Oscar was a good brother I enjoyed oh wait Ginny's in the back Jim Ginny's a lot older than Frieda so was it frog legs but if you took a frog though and put it in a bowl and pot of water what's the first thing it's going to do jump out but if you put it in that water and it's just about 70 degrees and then you just keep turning it up and turning it up and turn it up and turn it up and turn it up all the saying you got a bold frog if that's what you want but that's kind of like the way it is with us we've been so easy to where I think God now it's kind of turning the temperature up just a little bit trying to you know trying to keep us in line and keep us you say well why do we go to church every Wednesday never sunny why do we have to you know why because it keeps us ready for the time coming because we know the times coming we know we're in the time that is coming we're not in luthor we're now we got to go through justification i mean go through sanctification and the Holy Ghost and come into this age know we're in that age we're in the fourth age we must see that the son of man is hearing what he's doing oh we miss what we're here for but listen I promise you somebody will see it because God saw somebody see he threw for knowledge he saw somebody take this thing and carry it on if not then because remember he he doesn't cast his pearls before swine it will not return void his word because why when he speaks the word he already knows somebody's gonna take it so I let it be us I'm trying to give you a pep talk ever it's us it's not somebody else it's us you said you need a pep talk I need one every day when I get out of the bed I promise you when you get fifty eight years old you need a pep talk whether you give it to yourself or somebody else gives it to you you need a pep talk to get out of the bed spirits I mean naturally but not spiritually spiritually we do need a pep talk but this is where we get our pep talk we'll get our pep talk here hey madam when we mash play we get our pep talk because that's God talking to me telling me who I am or what I'm doing here all right so John 12:23 let's read this and then we'll continue them jesus answered them saying the hours come that the Son of man should be glorified ready verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall on the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit Jesus Christ had to die the son of man had to die so that you and I could have life all right so that's talking about the Son of Man the corn of wheat fell in the ground we know that was back in the Dark Ages also but Jesus I believe right here because he says this is the hour that the Son of man should be glorified how is he gonna be glorified he's got died amen you and I remember I I'll find that quote maybe next Sunday brother Brown said we are his victory because if he resurrected his self and there's nobody else got it what good is it no he got on the cross for me and you he died for me and you and he resurrect you for me and you man cuz he had children that he foreknew those he foreknew he did predestinate we're talking about that this morning down in in romans 8 and 9 finally got through 8 but verily I say to you except a corn of wheat fall on the ground and died abideth alone but if it not bring forth much fruit so before we get into this I'm gonna read a few more but remember remember the sign phoenician woman she said thou son of David if you don't think a position means something or a title or RA approach to God doesn't mean anything it did to the Tsar Phoenician woman the sovereign nation woman was what Gentile she said thou son of David have mercy on me thou son of David have mercy on me the Bible says he's never even turned around brother Ram said he never even acknowledged she was talking to him so don't tell me the titles of that part and that dispensation doesn't mean something but she said my lord now when she said my lord that covered it all alright so that's the same way with you and I codes remember brother Branham said we would at the end time that you would say called Jesus Jesus is not getting anything why because you don't have a revelation who thy name is that's why you won't get anything but if you know who that man is and if you know where he is his character and what he's doing then when you say Jesus he turns and says yes what can I do for you amen so if it die if it doesn't die if it falls in the ground died abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so it had to die to bring me and you forth remember but you and I had to be brought into the dispensation that we are predestinated for remember brother Branham way and we're still talking about the Eagle anointing that's our anointing the Eagle anointing is our raise up higher be able to see further get more revelation and absolutely soar above all others now that doesn't make us better than anybody else but you know what this age is like brother Branham said in the countdown he said this is the astronaut age God has pressurized you to make it you Luthor couldn't made it Wesley couldn't made it Pentecostal couldn't make it but you can make it because the Prophet told us you can make it you were pressurized you know why you're pressurized for the job because you don't have a lot of questions think about it you don't have a lot of questions like others did Wesley could open the Bible and he had a revelation of what he was coming to do but he didn't have a full revelation he didn't have a full restoration he was just reforming right he was just reforming the people to an idea to a method but that's what God was using for the time but then he was still a Trinitarian so he looked through it with turnit Aryan glasses right but that's not that's not restoration restoration is back to where the faith of the father's never had a revelation of father son Holy Ghost never had a revelation of eternal hell that ain't a revelation not a revelation it's a revelation that it's wrong but yet it's still in the Word of God Jesus spoke it baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost he said exactly what he was supposed to say but everybody took it as partial revelation and they said well we'll just baptizing G what jesus said we're not gonna worry about I mean the people who ever told you that and they've ever told you that they've told me they said well we'll take what Jesus said over what Peter said under that pentacon I said no they fightin each other in the Bible that's why they find each other I said I thought Jesus didn't have the keys to the kingdom I thought he gave him to Peter he said whatever you loose on earth i loosed in heaven whatever you bind on earth mind in heaven so when Peter turned that key God didn't say stop no no he said that's right so that's the way you have to look at but you know what that does take a revelation but but a revelation of Father Son and Holy Ghost being a true baptism is not a revelation the Trinity is not a revelation amen so but that's what I'm saying we now all have true revelant we have the revelation we have the faith of the fathers we have something to work with amen you and I have something to work with they didn't have everything to work with down through time you and I have something to work with weather and you know what it's whether you want to work it or not it's whether you want to work it or not you can work it if you want to and you don't have to you're still a free moral agent amen all right let's read John 11 will background just a minute and then we'll start mm-hmm continuing here John 11:21 then Martha said unto Jesus Lord if I'd been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever that I will ask you God God will give it to them jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again that's a good denominational idea amen that's a good that's cuz everybody thinks there's going to be a resurrection but what about a man standing there and said it's right here not coming it's right here because that's what he told Martha Martha senator I know all that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this know somebody's gonna fulfill that script or some kind of buddy's gonna believe that and he said whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe it's tell this everybody okay all right now we know that when I remember back up here that death has to be destroyed in this in this time a restoration of all things has to take place a resurrection that's a take place and a rapture takes place on this seal so we have to y'all sleep back there Regina you put them all to sleep talking about your vacation Hey no remember death has to be destroyed Anderson knock on the window back there then ain't he's running the show Josh Josiah knew it when you were to be working Bob hey Bob Bob sittin right there everybody blame Bob I tell you while they fix that we were at a be meeting the other day and this guy was doing this program and the lights were down you know and he was bringing out his little program and he was talking to hello he was talking about this program and he started talking about this guy named the fat man man that how you didn't like his what he was doing and he didn't like the way he fed his bees and he didn't like it and somebody said he's sitting right there the guy was in the fat bee man was in the meeting and this guy Lord you talking about backing up and you hear that boy he just bless his heart glad the lights were off his face was probably as red as that but so it wasn't Bob Bob sitting right there wasn't Bob fault this has to be destroyed the restoration of all things take place the resurrection has to take place a rapture takes place on this seal so this seal death is destroyed now the son of man remember watch in the son of god dispensation you can't kill the son of God son of God is the eternal God Creator God will look at in a minute but the son of man had to die to bring him into brotherhood with me and you he had to become human flesh to be heirs and joy there he had to die but the only nine wants the Bible said he died once for all all right so he died so that we don't have to die that's Believix now this we got to believe that because I'm telling you just as soon as he stood and said all power in heaven has been given unto me brother Brown said potentially that your body was even justified sanctifies I mean glorified what he said 2,000 years 2,000 years from that point we're still dying when we don't have to Jesus never stood up and said all power in heaven there's been giving just to me no it's been given unto me and I say that you go get in a room and in ten days from now you're gonna get the Holy Ghost and I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna dwell in you and the things I do you sure do also amen that's the part we miss the things I do you sure do also all right let's read number one restoration of the bride tree I like to read this because we know that this is the end time this is the last there is no fifty there's no fifth messenger there's no there's no restoration past this time listen listen Israel and all that that's all that's not Gentile so you got separated because when I say when I run a restoration is oh it's restoration is over for the Gentiles not for the Jews they've got 144,000 is going to have to be restored and get the Holy Ghost after we're gone so you can't say it but when but when the preacher says alright you know we say well well it's all done when we well it's all done for us it's all done for us the son of man listen they won't get a son of man revelation 144,000 no no we are the only ones we are the only ones that get that revelation while we're alive on the earth think about that think about what that prophet brought so that we can have right now not go too sure it's gonna be easy in the millennium to understand the son of man we got to understand it now because the son of man he's been here the whole time that's just not been a revelation of who he is and where he's at for killers took it for messengers destroyed it for messengers of death took it away in Dogma for messengers of righteousness restored her back again prophesied son of man can these bones live which we had time got to wrote down but have to miss the prophesy can these bones live what's the four stages of that coming forth to the church what is that that's human flesh that's human bones as human sinew that's human muscle that's human flesh and then what is it human life life being blown into what's the four stages of Ezekiel dry bones but the life only comes not when the sinew was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's the hour you and I are living in that's when it comes back that fourth message you notice he didn't say messenger there he said that fourth message of life I will restore stay at the Lord hallelujah glory praise be to God the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back the Pulte sanctification brought back the bark doctor of holiness walk ball back to leave Pentecost now look to get back with what I'm going to say in a minute these are all these are all the son of God in the church ages this is the son of God in the church ages walk bought breaks the leaves Pentecost he didn't say these was wrong this is what was bringing it back okay what brought it back the leaves Pentecost what is it Pentecost release clapping of the hands joy bridge Orson Pentecost what the forth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign that crisis finally after justification had been planted sanctification planted baptism of the holy ghost all these had to be planted and it had to be planted in me and you because you and I we understand listen there's a part of justification that nobody understood but us a mysterious part he's talking about a mysterious part of sanctification a mysterious part of the baptism the Holy Ghost you know what the mysterious part of the baptism the Holy Ghost to me starts it's not down here that's right here that's the mysterious part that man has left off they just said all we got the Holy Ghost we got the Holy Ghost shout speak in tongues just like I said Pentecost wave it whoa we got it brother Bronson didn't say they didn't have it he said they cabbies down and stopped and God moved on that plus he said that's good but plus means more what the forth was the word self the word made flesh fruits for the proof of the Resurrection son that Christ has finally after justification been planted same case you've been playing baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ has again centered himself like that cap of the pyramid you see it right back then first wine justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost then coming of the captain he's talking about the capstone revelation and who is the headstone the son of man is the headstone the son of man is the headstone so you and I we get that part what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out right now he's talking to you I'm gonna say this with all sincerity I love reading the Bible and don't get me wrong it does talk about me but this prophets message because this this is to Christians all around chews gentle and so is this but that's talking to me when that thing came when that message come at home down home down to where it's talking to he was telling us how to get out of here you and me not another group me and you now I don't take this over the Bible you understand don't get me wrong but when I read this I go man God is talking to me he said a man personally to talk to me he didn't seem to talk to you he seemed talking to me you got to say the same thing what is it that Holy Ghost months being honed out so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justified sanctified and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the Tree of Life is growing again what is it it's a bride tree why do you preach the resurrection of the or restoration of the bride tree amen thereby all right with that say ma'am all right proving his word number two we've read this from before I want to read it again this would be about time number five I'm like brother Claude if I read it 17 times you'll get it now after 1900 years with the church ages past now what she's putting it in position and all things that he prophesied of Luther Wesley we just went through and seeing it drawing out the moon came down brought it out the Lord wrote it on the board here for us and showed it come down himself and confirmed it right after 1900 years and we're at the end of the Laodicean Church age he promised in Luke 17 30 that this same son of man he promised it would be revealed in the days like it was in Sodom upon the earth did he do it does it have to come to pass it's impossible now remember he came in three names the son of man a prophet the son of God the spirit now he's talking about Jesus when Jesus come he came the Son of Man all right then the Son of God the spirit down through 7 Church ages will draw it out in a minute then the son of David for the Millennium but in between this conjunction now what's the conjunction the conjunction is between this and this because remember and don't get me wrong but you have two wipeouts under david for me and you and that's not to us sour Phoenician woman son of David have mercy we don't need that part so mark that one off for me and you but now that does go into the Millennium we know that but you and I have to get the Son of God in the Son of Man right the son of David will come when we get all those other parts right that ok but in between this conjunction now why is it got to be because remember God died in human flesh God resurrected in human flesh God went took a glorified body into another dimension in human flesh sent back his spirit to get into the believer to get them to understand what he's already said or understand the Word of God all right now according to his own words in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed that's now reveal himself as what not son of God son of man will reveal his self in a different way I want you to read that reveal yourself in a different way we'll show you maybe the different way in just a minute let's read number three we've been reading these we're gonna read them again because I don't want you to get confused yourself go to the next one please the anointing once a ten-time what is it not the angel as the son of man so get it out your head brother brown wedding son a man okay there's no one can be the Son of Man except Jesus Christ you can't a human being can't do what he did he's all he was human yeah he was human he was God what none of us in this building virgin-born so that just absolutely I'm just talking to y'all so that just kind of disc ludes us that's being the son of man okay so if you think William Branham is the son of man then he was virgin born and that ain't true we know that you like like somebody said ask him remember what they said that brother Browns kids were Immaculate Conception he spoke them into existence somebody said you need to ask sister Mita about that how silly and stupid and that is stupid because there's only one man he had to be the virgin born son of God because the Bible made him the virgin born son of God amen so let's give honor her honors do not the angel as the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the Son of Man because it's left - shuk can't organize it it's the grain itself again because remember the corn of wheat when it went into the ground that was the son of man that went in they planted the son of man over there in Jerusalem in that tomb on the side of a mountain right and then that son of man came out of that tomb God with human flesh and said I all power and heaven earth been given unto me so it's the grain but what happened is is that thing went back in the ground and it's come back today into the full-grain the revelation of the Son of Man all right now let's read number 4 now who is this son of man rising of the Sun this is quote number 4 in the beginning was the word now who is the son of man in the beginning was word was with god and the word was gone the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have in confirmation of the word of God by word of god by signs by wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke here that we just quoted from the Luke the 17th and 30th verse Malachi 4 different scriptures we're acquainted with that the word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead denominational ideas and the son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right among us and it's giving us life alright so now let's read number 5 3rd Exodus so that's the way it is again today cuz I want you to know something you and I this is for me and you so that's the way it is again today God is calling his elected people has he not called you you he's called you people you sitting in this building you have been called but what have you been called to you well I'm just in the message like brother Dale said this morning night you know I I could I don't cut my hair and I folks that's a laundry list that's a laundry list that we should be past leaving again the principles the doctrine of Christ let's go on to perfection okay and they are elected now and now they are elected for what now look we are elected for a resurrection and what kind of sign is he's showing them resurrection sign he showed the sign to me and you we are the elected for what for a resurrection you and I he's talking to us we are elected for a resurrection that's our box if you want to call it all right so now let's read right here and then will for a few minutes will drawn on the board who is this son of man Matthew 13 737 242 the parable of the store the seed now who was the sword the seed the Son of Man in listen listen in type because remember the Son of man has no well well you might say the Son of Man the Son of Man Jesus himself the man did have seed as a human mortal man but that ain't what this is talking about that's what got us in trouble so get off of it that's the part the guys in trouble we should have been the spoken word is the original see that's what he come for he come to speak us into existence he come to spread the seed Word of God the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one he the so it good seed is the son of man he actually gave you an opportunity to be born the second time he gave you the ability to be born again because your mom and daddy gave you a natural seed to be born the first time the Son of Man sowed the good seed amen brother Dale's been reading you were not born we're not born again of corruptible seed we're born of incorruptible seed which is the Word of God I wish people would get that everybody's you know you they get these wild ideas about this seed God's seed is his word period there's no little wiggling squiggly tail thing running around in God that was you know you were entwined in God's DNA which is his word his word is his power amen and you and I are intertwined in that if we're born again believers now right that makes you the children of God rather than a are the children of the devil you were born the children of the devil why you were born between Satan and Eve what the act the physical act that's our problem but God had to come down a human flesh to show the good seed remember he didn't have no physical children but what was he doing every time he was speaking for three and a half years he was what he was sowing the seed word so that you and I could be born because you and I are born by the Word of God amen that all right to me that's just so simple Matthew 16 when Jesus came to the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man am now that was the question we've been through this before but some of you knew and but we're gonna cover it again whom do men say that I the Son of Man I am now now that was it's not a man that's what he asked all right and they said some say you're John the Baptist some say you're Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say you that I am you've heard all these rumors who do you say I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of God right then he didn't say you're the Son of Man right don't Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God in other words we'll see them in the you were the Creator God they knew he would somewhere in that body was a creator somewhere somewhere in there somewhere you wherever you will try to figure that out in a minute and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou that he didn't say now Simon you didn't answer my question he answered it the best of his ability and actually I don't believe you understood it because it didn't come from him flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you but my father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this revelation not the revelation of what he asked remember you asked this question he got this answer and upon this revelation I'll build my church okay I'll build my church what is the church we're going to make it real simple that's going to be what seven church ages that's the Church of God started on the day of Pentecost and will end the Gentile ones when we go in the rapture all right that's the Son of God revelation upon this rock I'll build my church all right son of God is the spirit but now he didn't begin right here he began way over here and let me let me draw this he began in infinity you say beginning infinity is even wrong somebody got that started smiling you know but yeah he began in infinity but wait a minute the Bible says we're gonna read it in a minute and we're gonna tie this together with something he says the beginning of the creation of God now that's kind of that's what the Bible says so we had to have a prophet come and tell us so we had to brother Brown says what he said back before the eternal way back over here where there was no explanation of who he was he drops down into a form called the Son of God now I'm doing away with a bunch of quotes but if you don't know what he said by now you need to study because the son of God is the creator he's the one that stepped out and said come from Elohim the logos all the way down and spoke and said let there be let there be let there be let there be do you know there's somebody inside of you that when you look at pending stars he got he you were in him before they were now that don't make you nothing but it makes God something when his very thoughts was before those stars that are up in the sky because remember they had a beginning you don't preach that that'll help you there but look that's what you got inside of you and you know why brother Branham said you know why he said he what he said he said you have enough power in you to create a world why because the one who created the worlds within you I'm telling you we this is our problem this is us and this is God that's our problem this is us and this is God same line that's our problem we're like I said we're tunas more than we are wanting more than we are true oneness but the Son of God when you when you say who is the son of God that's what the revelation who didn't because remember who did he say it came from my father which is in heaven there's the creation there's the creator that's brother branham called it many things but you can call theophany the logos the speech the son of God was the creator and he was standing there in eternity amen then he comes down through the Old Testament thereby okay he comes down through the Old Testament as that person that understanding let's put it that way he come as that understanding cuz there's only one person of God okay but to be revealed to me and you listen this is where it's got to be this is where it's got to be because this is the way he told the Prophet and if the prophet he told it to the Prophet the Prophet told of us so it's got to be true so here's the Son of God the theophany the Genesis 1:26 man this man never fail even though this man was inside because remember if you look at your genealogy what did they call Adam then call Adam son of man they called him son of God because he was that original son that was supposed to watch speak and bring things forth right that's why I said I said Adams purpose was to bring me in you without sex spoken word because it didn't take sex to create the globen no gout no it was what his thought come down to a speech so there's your son of God the Son of God revelation takes for you from eternity to eternity but now remember it never fell it never sinned it never let me try to focus on something here it did not need a revelation hey no that's what I'm trying to say hang on just a minute because if we would see plainly this son of God it wouldn't be because right here's where he's hid the most not let me put it that way maybe the maybe the most he's hid is in the son of man cause nobody understood it they can understand the I worked across senator living god you're the creator god you're the Creator God all down through these church ages but they missed this one even when he come they missed him when he came they said well you're the son of God but remember the son of God is a spirit dot down through the Old Testament now remember that was Jehovah brother Brahim explained it many times God above us then he dropped down into the son of man God with us then he come back to the Son of God again but God in us above us with us and in us but why is right here right in here we got to have something in this conjecture because this is what this is son of David when we go in the rapture I don't want I want to stop right here if I don't do nothing else when we go into rapture God sure he goes to the Jews to get to 144,000 let's just put three and a half years or seven actually seven years over here he comes as the son of God because it's the Holy Ghost there buddy okay it's the Holy Ghost in the believer it's the Holy Ghost in the believer down to the church ages like said the Son of God never never fell thereby okay with that we can draw a line so this was the Holy Ghost for those of you that don't know that that Holy Ghost is what brother Branham said he came back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the soul of God and came into the believer and made him children of God upon this rock I'll build my church so he built all this on the revelation of the Son of God but right here he came as the son of man himself the person Jesus right okay okay so now we're back to what brother Branham said a minute ago he came as the son of man son of God son of David but right in this conjecture he has to come back as the son of man why why why do you have to come back to the son of man because the son of man is the only one that took a body change the son of man is my brother now sure we know for a fact right here that he was the son of God in seven Church ages amen that's the Holy Ghost son of God's Spirit God that spirit God went into the believers and made them born-again Christians with the baptism of the Holy Ghost but no rapture no body change no resurrection they'll be all right with that there's never been a shirt and I don't get me wrong people have been resurrected but they've died again I'm done by the resurrection like Jesus had a resurrection now he's one that had it he's the one who can tell us about it he saw all the Son of God can tell us anything yeah okay all right he's all-knowing but why do you become the Son of Man if we didn't even understand what he was doing he come down here to be our brother to show the ability for us to come but remember he left and didn't come back at the Son of man in the church angel he came back as the son of garden of church Asia but right before the coming of the rapture he has to come back at the Son of Man I just read it to you brother Brown many many many many many times so I believe we have a revelation of the Son of God if you've got the Holy Ghost today you have some sort of revelation of who he is if he's living inside of you you ought to have some semblance of a revelation of who he is and what he's doing he's helping you live a good Christian life but the son of man was God in flesh that was changed that was resurrected but also that came to earth and ate like you and I ate that bled like you and I bled that all right but he had to go away he had to leave but I'll come again tell no one this vision until the Son of Man remember he died right here this is the cross he died right here where else did he die son of man be risen again he died in the church ages they killed him but he's got to come back in power to teach me and you how to take a body change that's the whole purpose it's the four that son of man to be back in me and you and I'll have some quotes in that Sunday about all the son of man being in the bride not one person it's going to be in the bride of Jesus Christ not just one man all right they're very okay with that because you look this is what's going to be hard everybody okay now we got son of God's the Spirit God he's the one that created all things then he comes as the son of man in ad whoever for when he was born to a t30 he dies crucified rose again standing in a glorified body takes a resurrection comes back on the day of Pentecost as the son of God as he promised he builds his church on that alright and then he's got to come back at the son of man listen who in the world would have known that except for the prophet in the end time nobody would have known that you know why because nobody ever preached it to start with even Paul Irena smart none of them covered that son of man like William Branham did nobody you say well how do you know because the seven seals had to reveal the Son of Man the opening of those seals that we're talking about right now is telling you that your flesh can be changed let's just be real honest people down through the church ages did not rely on some message to take them to a body change when I die hallelujah by and by I'll fly away that's not much of a revelation in this day when I die and all these other deaths things well that's all they saw that but late but they knew that was going to come up Martha oh I know in the last days we're gonna resurrect jesus said my lord I am the resurrection believe in me believe this now this I'm telling you today in 2018 believe us now this that that same man that walked the shores of Galilee is walking in you and the same ministry is back in you the message of the opening of the seals it's for you and you only hey come on people there's things that I told you and I never tell you why she's my wife do you ever talk to you love her enough to figure out what he wants to do hmm because you got the Holy Ghost that's what many people and I'm sorry to say I've never heard anybody preach on the statue a perfect man except us here in this church have you I want you to raise your hand I want you to take short dummy all right one stood right there somebody preached on the Son of Man that's one hand out of about 80 but that's what's important that's the problem what a lot of people are getting the Holy Ghost and they say well I I got it and that's okay you're going to heaven but I want God to work in me like he worked when he was standing on the face of the earth he worked through one man called William Branham for a little while but he promised they'd work through all of us all of us from women to children to men it doesn't matter that's what I'm looking for I want the devil now look he destroyed the effects of the devil right there at Calvary but remember it's not going to be applied it hasn't even been applied to the church ages it's going to be applied to us for a short time and then 144,000 s got to die but then we got a glorious millennium but you know what's gonna happen in the Millennium Satan's still gonna be alive he's still gonna be there right but not that future home people that future home you'll see lots of son of man walking around in that new city so who is this son of man he's a revelation of the seven seals he's a revelation that your body can be changed nobody ain't nobody believed that hey hate the people in the message don't believe that you're gonna take a body change oh they say you're gonna take a body change but they say you're gonna get a new one that I need a change that's exchange like I said let's go back again that'd be easy for God to do just say all mark you've been living in an old Sam body just throw it down over yon and I'll give you a new that's not the way done Jesus he didn't just throw the body out in the desert like somebody preached you know no that man had nail prints in his hand but he ate fish and he walked to a wall that's the god I serve that's a god I have but do you know what the here's our problem we've read this one scripture Bob I'm getting to it and then we'll close let's go to revelations 1 we're gonna read this it started to be a little bit lone but everybody be alright revelations 1 verse 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice of the trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what they'll see us write in the book and sending them to the seven churches which are in Asia and Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia allowed us them and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and they're right here but I want you to watch what he showed John what he showed John alright in turn see the voice is paid with me and I turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with the garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle okay alright alright with that his head in his hair with white as wool and why does no one his eyes were flame to fire his feet was like brass as if they burned in the furnace his voice is the sound of many waters he had in his hand in seven stars now what was the seven stars that was the seven churches I mean seven messengers and out of his mouth was the two-edged sword and a watch let's not read that anymore but now it's read 18 I am he that liveth and was dead I am heat now he's telling you who he was there's the son of man there stood the son of man because he was dead at one time that flesh if that man walked in died I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death some we're in that fourth seal he takes those keys and makes them manifest why did this what is a seal listen and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him that's the fourth seal right here he is already an i elated that and have the keys of hell and of death now let's read what brother Branham says about it on the 7th church age 1954 now that's the Bible then what's the spirit said see the candlesticks all right now the 13th verse and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like the Son of Man what one like him who was this his bride hmm who was this his bride one like him watch how it was clothed with the garment down to the foot the holiness of Jesus Christ covering her he washed us from our sins with his own blood all right girded about the paps not a man roll it up please not a man a woman with a golden girdle the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ oh what a beautiful picture we get here under consideration and then he says down to the foot you know where it was that keep going down to where it says words read save time here keep going keep going and his feet were like fine brass that's telling you last Sunday I want to brother branham to explain it to you brass always his judgment now if his feet was like brass it was the believers in the seven churches right that's why I said we do not stand in judgment we stand as judge and then brass always his judgment you know the brazen altar and the brass serpent so forth brass speaks of judgment his feet then the Church of Jesus Christ is set upon divine judgment imaginable right with that you and I will judge angels you and I will judge the world I read that to you believe it's now this Amen believe it's now this and I want to read you this let's go to Revelation 3:15 and let's see what's going to happen here I kind of I kind of you know sometimes you and you do it as well as I do you think you got a revelation and then sometimes you don't but then you what then when you find a quote where brother branham confirms that revelation you thank God for it because he didn't send that prophet to you he sent him to me and I've already told you them and to the angel of the church of the laodiceans right now this is me and you these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now who was the beginning of the creation of God the Son of God no he was the creator who was the beginning of the creation to God the Son of man you saw how in the world that's the way the creation should have been had there not been a fall Jesus came virgin born spoken word of God you and I come the same way huh when you're born again you're not born again a sex you born again in the spoken word of God the beginning of the creation of God and brother Branham says you and I are the King yet continuation of that creation I know that works that they don't need a coal in their heart now this is us I would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because I said I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may us be rich talking to me and you know and what raiment that thou must be closed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear in the north of all eyes with eyesalve that thou mayst see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent now listen this is not in any other Church age this next statement this is for us this is our box behold I stand at the door knock hold on a minute that has to be a man standing there behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and what's up with him and here with me now for a long time I saw that's got to be the son of man that's not the Son of God the Son of God never was put out of the church Bob son of god was never put out of the church it's the son of God down through 7 Church ages folks who would put out of the church the Son of Man was put out of the church and couldn't get back in I have a quote go to the next one if you don't believe it but I'll let brother Ram tell you feast of the trumpets 1964 words now listen loosening of these a classic leads ethical spears now 20 years later after that war we see the loosening of the ecclesiastical spear one under the seventh seal that's us the seventh trumpet of the Jews look at the moon darkening out what the intent when did the moon darken out in the loudest and church age remember he drew that little bit of light that was left in the loudest in church they show he's talking about us so it drawn out the son of man being drove from the church not the son of God the Son of Man that's what brother Dale's been preaching and that's what thrilled my soul this morning that's what he's preaching the son of man is what was drove out of the church not the son of God that's not the son of God standing at the door knocking he's in the church he's in the believer it was a revelation of the Son of Man they went they put out they put him out of the door but he said can I come back in what a gentleman can I come back in because when you bring somebody into your house you've welcomed them there and you make them a part of the house and a part of your fellowship that's the whole part the Son of Man was what was drove from the church that was the son of man standing in that revelations behold ah can I interpolate behold i the son of man Stan at the door because it's a human being knocking remember what brother Graham said in Revelations 5 he said that had to be a human that took the book he said a lamb can't take a book he said it had to be a human that was this bloody son of man that took that book see that we can go on another Avenue with the Son of Man the Son of Man is what took the book hello bleeding bloody man took the book that was the son of man because he's your is your intercessor the Internet only one intercessor between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus why the man Christ Jesus so who is this son of man he's now back in his church we have opened the door somebody broke the seal and laid him in somebody somebody broke that seal and let that son of man back in the door because he's back in his church he's right here well I may not admit nothing to you but it did to me then he waited till the very end time when they throwed him out of the church because remember when we get to that Seventh Seal that's the end of all things what ended what ended Christ's earthly journey he died well I said you hear me what ended Christ's earthly journey he died and he came back as the son of God that son of man was hid now sure John turns and looks and sees one like unto the Son of man you say well that's wrong brother Dale brother way that's wrong no it was God's bride is feminist God's bride is God in human flesh even in the fourth church age that was God in human flesh but their understanding was not that he had already been put out of the church but God through the Son of God revelation gave them just enough to get through believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved amen then the Son of God will come and dwell in your heart but that's not in your heart that's not in your heart you got it in your heart down here this is working on the second man it's just working on the spirit realm of man and when we get right up to here of them brother Dale gets the worries taught it it's the same thing the son of man if listen if the son of man was the headstone right here and he was rejected then the son of man's got to come back as the headstone in the end time saying son of man to be accepted open the door and let him in let's stand our feet open the door and let him in you know I don't feel sorry for the people back in the other ages that's what we built everything on they just didn't have enough revelation they didn't have enough revelation to believe that that was God that they were God in human flesh and then Lord of mercy when the denominations come along made him three come on made him three made him false baptism thank you brother made him help me in eternal scaring people what they do they put that son of man outside the door and they said no we'll take that but this is too strong for us remember this is meat you say oh that's me well yeah but this is meat this is the Eagle age this is the flesh age hey man where God in human flesh is gonna do what he said he'd do I promise you he's going to do what he said he would let's sing a song you love the Lord pay attention to what God's saying do you forget what I say to you pay attention what God's saying to you you pay attention what he say take these short words and you know let them let them bloom open the door lady man that's the son of man in now flowing I can't die I'll be rested by and by okay men some glad morning when this life is or [Applause] flying home on God's election flyways [Music] why he can't fly let your needle I'm gonna fly way I can die I'll be raptured by a my my way when the shadows publish wanna have grown fly away like a bird from prison bars hello listen the Son of Man is always wanted to let itself alone Oh and when on sales whoa there he was he had let herself back or they'd open the door and let him back his nod I'll be right here by my Oh my way a few more weary days and then fly away land we're gonna whatever toran shake somebody's hands they gotta bless you fly away fly away Oh glory I'm gonna fly away oh I can't uh I'll be raptured bye they of course again [Music] fly away Oh glory gonna fly away one morning between 6:00 and 9:00 we gonna fly away my MA fly away amen what a time I mean what a time you yeah it's like brother Dale said it's really nice to have healings and and an emotion but man let's get excited about this get excited that that there there's there's a time and a place for all things this is the time and this is the place for the son of man to not be outside the church to be in the church you bring him to church and you nurture him and yet that is the stature of a perfect man that is the stature of the Son of Man and man so we get it as we eat we get stronger and then one day it's just going to materialize folks it's not gonna be some great mm-hmm my brother Dale said brother mode always said it's not you know firemen even in their haste our firemen never skipped a rung he knows how to he knows how to climb that ladder why he ain't comment faster because if you jump about three rungs up and grab it and you miss you might get hurt but they know how to do it and that's the way it's been happening where that that fireman climbing each each level each ladder and we don't miss a step we don't miss the step we won't get hurt but that last step is not this far where all the other ones were like this because if you have you ever went down the stairs that they weren't even that's why all steps are supposed to be even because your brain is in cadence walking down the steps well if you got one that's this tall and one it's that's tall you're in trouble God steps for just nothing they're the same this thing this whole thing all through life God has brought us to a place to where all we do is now is just feed on the Word of God feed on the Word of God feed on the Word of God there's not some magic formula that we're going to stir up somewhere in the back room and everybody drink it and go in the rapture no it's gonna be the Word of God but the son of man standing at that door but when brother Branham preached those seals and broke those seals he broke that door open I believe and Christ walked right into the church and said Here I am but you know what the problem was they were looking at William Branham they were looking at William Branham that's why he had to go off the scene he must decrease that I may increase what Christ increased Christ increased in me and you hey man it wasn't brother Brown standing at the door oh he got kicked out of a lot of places sure but it was Christ standing at the door knocking that son of man said let me back in please and I'll sup with you in other words I'll commune with you and that's what he's done when those seals opened in 63 I believe God was started communing with man like he had like he had wanted to commune with man since the beginning of time because remember we didn't lose our what with it we didn't lose our was part of the family we lost our fellowship we didn't lose our relationship you born again you can't lose your relationship but you sure can lose your fellowship he wants to get back to where he can walk in the cool of the day just like he did with Adam and say my son how was everything today how was everything my sister was everything good everything was fine that's the way God wants us to be everybody okay everybody all right we'll be back here Winston out Lord willing to hear another good service and you pray for us and we'll pray for you all mine's clear let's bow our heads the Heavenly Father this day Lord has come that we see you North Lord that you're not some outsider anymore you've been put out of the church down through the church ages you've been put out the Lord through a endtime message the door has been pulled wide open and there you are the son of man that wants to live through the hearts and lives of his children right here at the closing of time right we're right up against eternity right at the chains of the body something that's never happened to anyone except you father Lord go with us help us to understand you Lord we have to understand you the way you wrote it because that's the way you saw us understand it I wish we could all realize that then it's not something hard if you'll just let the one that wrote it live in your heart Lord forgive us of our sins and many mistakes and bless us Lord as we go on the highways keep us all safe till we come back Lord together with you father just bless us to take care of sin jesus name amen [Music] [Applause] my way I can't die to be raptured bye-bye [Music] fly away and this just a few more weary days and then flower to a land worth joy shall never Oh [Music] fly fly away Gauri ah highway in the morning
