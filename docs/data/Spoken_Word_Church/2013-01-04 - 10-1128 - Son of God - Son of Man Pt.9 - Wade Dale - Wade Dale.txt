========================================

okay good to be back good to meet you today i slept good last night because all my babies were there we were all in the same state last night state of shock man did have a thing to pray about so she just went on to sleep all right revelations 3 14. now what we're doing is we're going through this son of god the son of man now we i think we kind of got the gift of who the son of god is the son of god the spirit god god before the foundation of the world jehovah the word the logos the speech the theophany all those words um is bottled up in this one person the son of god now to become a son of man remember he had to first be the son of god and then that son of god could take his word in the old testament and he could make it manifest in the new testament in the body of flesh he didn't do it in the old testament the old testament he would use man anoint come off the man anoint he'd even anoint balaam you know a hireling prophet a false prophet he would even anoint balaam but see if balaam ever got born again or if god was able to get down into the soul of that man he wouldn't have done what he did by um taking israel to whoredom you know god told him to don't mix your race and satan told balaam said hey you can't go against god but let me tell you a different way that's the same way did eve right you know adam and eve were going to multiply and replenish the earth there was no doubt they were going to but they were supposed to do it the way god wanted them to do it not the way that they did it afterwards so that's the same way with balaam balaam was a prophet of god he knew what he was doing he knew how to do the sacrifices he knew how to talk directly with god and god talked directly to him okay those kind of prophets are they born prophets like absolutely they got a gift just like they got a gift just like brother brown yeah now i said just like the reason i say just like is like jeremiah isaiah and all those they all have a gift see because you can be a gift brother brandon i was reading the other day i think was on the plane coming back things that are to be they were talking about satan casting out satan and then this one guy told brother branham said when i what about this witch that we got that lives in chicago and she goes and you know does all these she's a diviner uh she does devination he said well now that's of satan brother brown said now that's satan he said but now the healing that the people get that's of god right so she had the gift but see she was only 60 right like jeannie dickinson they can enter into a law god's got a law well see god had a law of reproduction but the law of reproduction was that he was supposed to be spoken word so what did satan do he just took that and perverted it because god had already showed the animals reproducing sexually okay but no problem with the male and the female in the animal kingdom because there was no conscience it was just she came into heat every so often and you had babies and that's all it was for read marriage and divorce and it'll explain it very well but we come down to somebody like balaam balaam could hear from god well he did because remember even balaam told bailout said hey i can only say what god tells me to say and he did he said curse israel balaam went to god and did the altar did the sacrifices and he approached god just like just like moses did but in balaam's heart the end of bala was the problem because balaam turned toward money women and popularity which was the money part brother around city with a higher length so satan just entered into balaam because balaam was a he wasn't a born-again believer but he was a prophet but satan entered into that man and gave him an idea i said hey you can't curse israel like this man wants you to curse him right and you can't curse israel because god won't let you curse israel the way you are in in your in the way you you approach god but now watch what satan does say just like he did eve he said oh you won't surely die he told balaam he said off he said i got a way to do it let's take these more bite women let's take these israeli men and let's mingle them together well as soon as they did that guess what god said that's it i'm cutting you off right there so he got his way yeah satan did but it was in a perverse way and that's the same way with with with diviners and people uh fortune tellers they can be right some of them and have a gift because remember gifts and callings are without repentance there's your scripture right there that answer your question right there gifts and calls it without repentance you'd be a rank center and have a gift you have a gift of healing because you're not the one that does the healing right right how could the beatles the beatles had a healing campaign they were a devil himself brother he must have had an open channel with god because when god told him don't go with him sure he did and then he said later on he said let me go back and ask god again see if you'll let me go sure absolutely right that's what i said he see god god in the old testament said okay you do you make seven altars with seven realms which brother brown said that was the type of jesus christ he said balaam knew the approach to god he knew to do those seven sacrifices and then see god under the blood of bulls and ghosts god had to come down and he had to he didn't have to honor that prophet he wasn't honoring balaam right he was honoring what he said balaam just entered into that same law and could get a an audience with god what about the witch of endor there's another example which of endor was just absolutely uh you know a devil she got samuel out of paradise didn't she it's like your dad was talking about brother right homes don't shoot himself oh sure but the gift was protected the freedom of agency was still honored exactly see brother branham could see god was protecting the gift because he knew that man and that gift was going to become one right all right but see balaam and his gift never became one as far as that because there was no blood of jesus christ to clean balaam up balaam was just it was just he can't say he was a sinner but or an unbeliever but he was a center and an unbeliever you know he just wanted according to the old testament what he done was is he got uh he got him to you know remember god said don't marry out of your ranks marry the you know marion israelite married you know in your lineage and balaam took them off to one side and they couldn't ever get back they went in to hoard them and god told them in ezekiel and jeremiah he told him you've committed order against me you've done what i told you not to do so that's why i've said many times and and i don't back down one bit before this thing's over with you're going to see somebody raise up with a gift that's going to be so close and it's going to drag a lot of message people they don't care people let me tell you something people will not this is on the internet people will not care what a man preaches as long as he's got a gift that's right right they will not care if it we're not saying that's balaam ain't that balaam that's balaam he can be black and son inside and have a gift and go around the world and and preach this message and have a gift of divine healing now not the gift but a gift because there's gifts of healing in the bible gifts and callings are without repentance those people will they'll drag them something's got to happen that's going to drag all these people that are that want to look for signs and wonders only i said only if you only look for signs and wonders to know that this message is true you're going to be swept away right brother i believe that brother i really do because in matthew 25 it says false christ false anointed ones they're false the gift they have is true but remember the people in the in the beatles campaign the people that got healed they weren't dependent on the beatles to heal them they inherited a law of faith i believe that those people are have some way to intercede that's what brother brown said about the pope some people get their healing through the pope because they believe he's an intercessor to you know he's a direct contact to god and let me go a little bit closer why do y'all call brother dale to pray for you all right right mm-hmm why don't you call danny sometimes right once you call brother ray sometime no joe brother donny myself why you call brother dale you want him to intercede for you right because you think he's got direct contact to god and that's not saying any and i believe he does ain't no doubt but what are we believing in we believe in him brother dale's going to give us our healing we better not rise right we better believe that he can cut that he's got a you know he's got a uh lift-to-ear relationship with god but you and i should have a religious relationship to god it's okay knowing somebody else they'll believe myself brother claude were talking about this last weekend or weekend for last we have come to a time and it's all of us it's going to slap us all in the face we've come to a point in time to when we have become a catholic organization because what we do is we don't study we don't pray we don't read our books we don't read our bible we come to church one time a week most of you we on sunday and guess what we do brother dale you do the studying for us you do the praying for us you do the rea what is that all right go to catholic mass that's exactly what you do you go to catholic mass and you do this right here and you say you go talk to god right point to the priest of the pope we've become just a catholic organization i mean sure i mean even born again people but it's that spirit of this ages you do it for me you go do it it's that catholic dogma that come all the way down through time and it's worked its way in the message same thing we sit there like a bump on a log we go to georgia game we scream and shout who can't get to church on time and that's all of us that's me too that's all of us i mean it's just it's we cut it i've always told you on people it's gonna come down to the life you live it ain't gonna come down to how much you know in this bible right or how much you know the message that you can physically know in your head quote if we don't believe that we're this book not a part i mean not not not not a or being able to read it but be a part of that book right that's just what i'm saying wednesday night for those who weren't there wednesday night you need to listen that message even though i did preach it but the author in some way if i wrote my commentary of my life i could give it to brother donnie and brother donnie could read that and he said oh well that's a good story but i wonder what he meant about this i wonder what he meant about that i wonder what happened in between all this and that's the same way with this that's what we're doing now but if you some way you can take my persona my being and transform myself we were talking about transformed by bothering you and the mind if i took and transformed myself into brother donny because that's what god wants to do and the new birth he wants to take his mind to give it to you so i'm the author of the book donnie's reading the book as a second person if you read it as a second person you're the devil talking about the bible you got to read this first person's right but you've got to get into the same brother brother never made these little comments for nothing you know if i was beethoven i'd write a symphony but what was he telling us he said if you've got god in you you understand this book because what have you done you've become god all right you've become the author of the book right right and that's what god wants us to be he wants us to be part of the author of the book he don't want just because millions of people read this bible like a commentary like a history like a well it happened back then well and most denominations are that way most people in the message are that way they read this as a good story book but until we see our name and when we read that scripture we see our name and that we're identified in that then what have we done see if i take what i am and i give it to brother donnie and some way he moves himself out of the way remember that book i read uh the word made flashing india trip you need to read that book that is a powerful book from 1954 that the prophet preached but he said if you never get the mind of god he said then you say to this mountain then you say to this cancer then you say to them you say to that all right but if i can transpose myself into donning donnie can move himself out of the way then when donnie reads my book he's living it just like i lived it and that's what he wants us to do in this word of god he wants us to live it just like he lived and if we don't then we miss him if we read it as a second person second person is always the devil right this is why i appreciate this ministry here i thanked and i thank the lord on the way down because we're told the dangers that we're amazing even as bride we're told we're becoming a catholic organization oh if you told people that they run you out of church that's why i never say it in another church so i'm here on the internet that's their business but that's the way it's become we sat down on sunday and we look up at the preacher and we say we're here fill us up yeah study for me okay that's right but we've got to become this new race that we're talking about you know some of us don't even open our bibles when he's reading the scriptures yeah that's to me that's disrespectful but whatever yeah they we got preachers to get in the pulpit now that don't take their bible that's true they read it they take and run it off on the computer and they read but that's little that's just little things that bother you susan if everybody's like you we'd all be like you and that's not pointing at soothing that's not pointing that suit at that point at all tyler settle down i was thinking something a minute ago and he picked up my thought over there but that's what that's why he come down to here from this great person we can't understand that truly honestly back when they first wrote the bible i would say that a lot of people didn't understand it and the latin vulgate had they brought that latin vulgate and they brought it into the that's why the roman catholics have it in latin it's the pure it's what was written off the scrolls and you know brother brown said god preserved that through the catholic church catholic church put all that together well see it got to a point where the catholic church says well you can't understand this we're the only ones that can interpret it well that's satan because that's two people see but we have a group of people called a bride that was that that a lot of them got in the same realm as the composer and picked these thoughts up and let's read revelation 3 14 to the angel of church of the land to see and write these things said the amen excuse me the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now see let me explain something about here isaiah was not the beginning of the creation of god adam was not the beginning of the creation of god abraham was not the beginning of the creation of god jeremiah was not the beginning of the creation of god malachi was not the beginning of the creation of god john the baptist was not the beginning of the creation of god yet jesus told the disciples that the least in the kingdom that's what we're going to talk about is greater than john but john was the greatest of all prophets he preached six months didn't have no healing campaign stood in mud for months teaching teaching repentance eating locust and wild honey he went to cracker barrel locust and wild honey exactly what he got but that's where he ate at he ate locust and wild honey listen he didn't have no church the holy ghost quickened him in the womb of his mother he didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost he didn't have the new birth sorry brother branham will confirm that i actually found a quote the other day where he said that john the baptist didn't have any birth but he was quickening his mother's womb by the holy ghost which is an anointing you have an anointing like that we understand that life only comes after the baby's born okay but it was showing you one thing for sure john and jesus had a connection somewhere they were connected together you know even earthly they were cousins you know by the by the sisters i mean by the mom but see that's immaterial because he wasn't right he wasn't the cousin of nobody right but the beginning of the creation of god was in acts 2 started actually jesus was the beginning and then there was more to come because jesus was the beginning so if there's a beginning there has to be a continuation so now let's read acts 2. acts 2 verse 1 when the day of pentecost was fully come there were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were city they appeared under them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost now this wasn't an anointing upon these people they were filled their cup was running over and began to speak with other tongues that the spirit gave them utterance all right and they weren't cowards anymore they threw the door open and run downstairs and what did they do peter preached them a sermon verse 14 peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of judea and all you that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words and he wasn't a scared coward anymore that's right for these are not drunken it's supposed singing but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions your old men shall dream dreams the same time let's go to verse 37. now when they heard this who the people outside because 120 had already been filled with the holy ghost all right they were pricked in their heart in other words a message was preached there was a conviction and they said well in other words how can we act like you or how can we do what you're doing how can we how can we get this knowledge because actually peter preached him for all the way from joel all the way till the present time because in verse 36 he said that god has made that same jesus whom you have crucified both lord in christ they were preached in their heart what they were convicted in their soul god called they answered they heard a sermon and they had to hear a sermon now why didn't that happen before the day of pentecost holy ghost hadn't been given seed life only comes through the body so you have to hear a holy ghost preacher receive the holy oak right and said unto peter and the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do and peter said unto them repent and be baptized everyone in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what is the gift eternal life for the promise of them to you and to your children and to all that are far off that's us right even as many the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his words were baptized in the same day they were added unto them about three 000 souls now here is the key verse 42. we always stop at 41. and they who those 3 and 120 continued steadfast in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayer that's the difference probably there was more than 3 000 people listening because see that was the feast of pentecost everybody come in from the on the feast of pentecost everybody came into jerusalem from all over the country so what happened to the other ones they didn't stay steadfast they did not continue in the faith remember i read the quote last wednesday where it said why did god pick abraham because he knew abraham would continue down through the generation he would continue what god had told him in other words he didn't count it not probably he spoke to you know john henry is his neighbor and john henry said hey god i believe you but he knew that he wasn't gonna he knew in his heart that john wasn't going to carry it down through right they didn't go on being right being born again exactly all right so there now we start in the book of acts now that was the beginning of the creation of god is when jesus ascended came back on the day of pentecost he was the first fruits he was the one that that said all power in heaven and earth has been given unto me and then if you'll terry in jerusalem i'm going to give that some of that power to you i said son because you didn't give it all to him he gave some of it to him all right but all is all they had all that they needed but it's like i was telling them and like i've used the example before remember you know you look through your hands here and i see brother and sister kathy but that doesn't negate that all of you are not in this room no you're in this room but i'm going to see but as my vision is pulled back i see there's a room full of people that's what god god's word's always been eternal god word's always been salvation god's word's always been perfect god's word's always been for all generations but luther saw this much of it he looked through glass darkly like paul said same way with paul so here started this great creation or this new creation or new race of people started in the book of ice you said in your race yes god started regenerating he started taking sinners um didn't care what their background was and told them like paul said you're a bunch of you know he told the corinthians he went through that whole thing fornicators assemblers thieves robbers all these things he had a man in his congregation that was living with his mother he had to get rid of all that this was in the church this wasn't out in the ghetto this was in the church so he took care of all that but what did he do when he took care of all that the people didn't say bless god i'm right and leave no they repented they got right and they had a church so this started the new creation new race of people the new race of people is there never was a race of people on the face of the earth that had the new birth in their soul like started on the day of pentecost book of acts nobody had been that's why it was a new creation the beginning of the creation of god that's the way god wanted it to happen when that holy ghost fell on 120 that's exactly what god saw from the beginning he wanted that from the beginning and then here it came to pass but now let's turn to matthew 17 because down through the ages this revelation of one god water baptism all those things got eroded like we said the catholic church took the bible and said well we can't understand it you can't either so we'll do the best we can with it and let me tell you something uh if you read things that are to me i believe that's where i was reading brother brown he said i know catholics that are saved now that was back then i don't believe ken now but i believe i was back then there was a time that you could be born again brother brown so you could take an egg and put it under a dog and it hatched but that's what he said but i don't believe they stayed in the roman catholic church i believe he talked about they got converted coming in the message okay so who had her hand up i always said that the catholics that the hierarchy in the catholic church took that word away from the people so they had no way of knowing sure they could tell them what they wanted them today they'd have to be leaving well you had to me you could do the indulgences you can the roman catholic church was in it for the money so they said okay believe on the lord and you'll be see that's what hit luther watch that movie martin luther the the new one it's it was done very well because it was done according to what the prophet said now they probably didn't know that but it was done it was done right according to history and that's where brother brown got history the history of martin luther but martin luther come out with a just show led by faith well martin luther would still lay on the floor prostrate himself on rocks and lay there and just pound his head trying to get those thoughts out of his mind because he had come under such a conviction but he was trying to do penance beat himself on the back you know got on his knees and crawled on you know on the on the rocks he was trying to do penance and even one of the priests told him said luther you're going to go crazy stop it one time i think he said trust in god and then i believe you know that was kind of where that god started dealing with him i believe you say from a catholic priest there was some good catholic praise i mean at least back then they knew what they were talking about maybe some of them did but uh but martin luther was catholic and uh when he wrote those 95 thesis what he was wanting to do was want the catholic church to just quit doing all these indulgences and quit fleecing the people because that's what they do they're going to community if you watch a movie go on a community you've sinned you've done this you've done that you've had a bad thought pay two dollars and we'll sign you a little paper remember the little girl had it you know the had a little girl on her back that was a or something and they said well you know give some money and we'll you know make it better no it was just like a sideshow thing but martin luther finally caught that the just shall live by faith now martin luther had great signs and wonders follow after that so he did come out of the catholic church i mean there was no doubt about that but he was he was still you know sacrament father son holy ghost all those things he was still connected to the church but it was god trying to get the people out it's just like us i mean you didn't come in overnight he didn't come and use that overnight he had a lot of stuff happening still but god as he moved along god had to get that out of it and that's what it you know people say well i'll come in overnight no you did no you had a lot of fun hanging on right yeah yeah we all did even people growing up in the message the same way you got a lot of baggage all right let's read matthew 17 let's let's see how this is going to become to where we have to have the son of man back again just give me a few minutes chapter 17 and after six days in other words after six thousand years something's going to happen a day is a thousand years thousand years a day right in other words in the seventh church age this is what's going to happen jesus takes peter james and john his brother and brings them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment as white as snow now you know brother branham i don't have the quote here but brother branham said he said and behold there appeared unto them moses and elijah there was three of them moses was the law elijah was the prophet right and jesus represented us glorified jesus represented us all right so we were represented there you say well there was moses elijah where were we we were in jesus christ we were standing that we were in him in eternal life if you have eternal life today you were represented there let me put it that way then answered peter and said jesus lord is good for us to be here if that will let us make your three tabernacles one for thee one promoting one for lies when he spoke behold a bright light or a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold the voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were so afraid and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid when they lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only all right and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them tell the vision to no one until the son of man be risen again from the dead now on the rising of the sun brother brown says that that's at the end time because it says tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead again in other words the son of man rose one time easter morning right right he's gonna he's not gonna be killed again they're not gonna put him on a natural cross but they're gonna kill his effect joel same thing with joel joel said he'll pour out a spirit upon all flesh but he did also talk about the palm warm cankle worm caterpillar locust eating the tree down and that's what happened in the church ages and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elise are elijah verse first come and like claude said they're looking for elijah to come and we went through that series they they leave a place for elijah they leave the door open for elijah all right elise truly shall first come and restore all things period now elijah go and get that brother okay well brother joel get it in elijah elijah did not or the spirit of elijah through john the baptist did not restore all things right right he didn't he preached repentance he didn't preach baptism in the name lord jesus christ so lives truly shall first come and restore all things and that to me shall is future right that's now right that's the elijah that we have but i'm saying to you that elijah has come already john the baptist and they knew him not but have done it to him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them god
