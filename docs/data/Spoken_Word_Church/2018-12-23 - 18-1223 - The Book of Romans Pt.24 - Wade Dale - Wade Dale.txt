========================================

I've got several clients all right good main here I don't want to thank y'all for the gifts that were given we appreciate it begin in myself I'm going to yes come on buy me a new murder yeah and that's not a little bitty thing that's one you get in and it turns you upside down yes that it's very good for you back and it's very good for your lamps on how you get in if you strap your legs and your knees in it then you hit the button and it goes back for Jim Carrey where you at that time you get strapped in if she gets upset with you she if you guys upset with me I'll not go near the thing all right let's get start on the other side this is going to cover a little bit about what we're going to talk about stairs v II don't know if y'all watch Wednesday night but you should have and if you hadn't then I'm gonna review it today but still we must see the transgression of Israel so that we can be grafted in and that's the whole point is that Israel committed to Helius sin God didn't kill her he just put her away now that doesn't mean that she can't be the servant just like you know just you look at your marriage and divorce situation just because you have to live in husbands or to limit why that's not going to send you to hell there's a lot of things that you might not get to do but it's not gonna see it's not salvation issue it's a committed somebody changes you if you just want to really get down to the bottom bottom you can't have two husbands you can't - living the wild or to live and husband study if you do then God couldn't do what he did he put Israel away divorced her I read it when Tina he put Israel away but he didn't kill her you don't have a right to kill you why unless you back in the Old Testament you don't have a right to your wife because you commit the daughter but you can't take her back because she's been defiled and you can't receive her back that's why another man can't have reader because it's their defiled and that's in the flesh part of you not in the spiritual part the only one you have that is thinking this other day the only one that you have in a theophany is in your mind you don't have a woman you're you understand what I'm saying we are human as human and human can make but the only your mind is where you receive the Holy Ghost not the womb of your flesh the woman your flesh I said many times before and Paul's covering a lot here the one with your flesh like brother Brown says she can be forgiven but she can't be justified in other words once you leave your virginity let's just be honest once you lose your virginity you can't redo that right okay but you can be forgiven for it yeah that's not a big deal at all you can be forgiven if you're truly honest like that I always think of that poor Rosella and brother branham's meeting you know drunk props up to you and Nene said here she sticks now clean seeing God's eyes she's cleaned now the whole world seen her before there was you up but in God's eyes she's clean yeah alright and and she'd go down testifies and and all that for the Lord the Lord which is wonderful I mean to me that's that's redemption in your soul now we got to work on redeeming the body and realizing that that really you didn't do it is that really is attached in there somewhere that really you didn't do it anyway so to me that's the grace of mention divorce because we were all prostitutes in our spiritual realm we were all prostitute we had a different husband that husband had to die so that we can make Christ problem is as we came divorce Satan came divorcing because he's still alive he's got to be dead in your life and watch what Paul says no we're talking about we'll talk about the fifth seal afternoon but that fifth seal Jew is in the lead group of people set aside but there had to be a min grafting of the Gentiles will look in the dangled 70 weeks afternoon but that in grafting of the Gentiles will the church ages come in on that chart that's the engrafting that Paul's fixin to talk about and that Israel was blinded so that you and I could come in so now adjust God came literally wined his people and then destroy him he's putting him in the fifth seal Jew and giving him eternal life so what a great thing great says that's what I said it Wednesday night no way man can come up with grace no way we are not graceful people it's always you did this I did that and you always hold that mark against whoever it is you can't we can't probably we can forgive ourselves you gotta start with forgiving yourself first but if you can't forgive others then that's not gracious alright so look I like to cover that fish still means a lot more to me than just sold under the altar that are Jews being given eternal life for just being the G but watch what Paul says here I may read this afternoon but since y'all are here I'm going to just read it today I say they have God cast away his people all right last Wednesday we read we read it again in Jeremiah Ezekiel God called them he called them horde them he called him a horsewoman he called him a prostitute he called him everything in the book okay but have God cast away his people no because remember I read that in Jeremiah recent how can this a woman with a suckling child forget the job you can't any woman has had a baby never four kids whether she gives her the way when she never forgets you in there baby so God will never forget it ever forget it alright and not forgiving is well he's got to do something with her or for her which is what we're coming in the fifth silver watch here have God cast away his people god forbid now what's Paul fixing to tell us is that now he is an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin so he is a Jew Paul did you Paul is covered in jury j-wro I jury God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew they've killed you 144,000 all those things you me but right here he's talking about the Jews because watch he says watching not what the scripture says of their lives realizing how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altar and I am left alone remember when Jezebel pronounced it Elisha she was going to kill Elijah he run into a cave and he did instead Lord there's nobody left but me and they seek my life in other words Jezebel is out to kill me that's my favorite scripture Oh have they left me alone well did God reminds you like you did him while you hang your head down for good God God answered live and told him said I'll buddy I got 7000 right just like you okay so you know do they seek my life but what saith the answer of God into him I have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of bale in other words Elijah said I'm the only one gone another one that's message you believe that right God said now I got seven thousand people around the country the bleep same way you did even so then at this present time bringing it up to here there is a remnant according to the election of grace now that we're graced and if by grace then it is no more of works because remember when Christ died on the cross he died once for all so there's no other work involved we just got to believe he did that's our problem we start listing what we got to do yeah laundry list of things we got to do well grace grace never made a list if you make a list it becomes works you just write grace up there somewhere at your house just right grace because that's what it is comes by grace thinning this no more works otherwise grace is no more grace like I just said then but if it be of works then is no more grace otherwise work it's no more work what then he's fix an answer question Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for Israel God's people a range of that wings not Israel is God's people he says he was there he said he was married to okay they did all these things now don't you think he knew they were going to absolutely but he left him going and do it but what but the election hath obtained it now be there is all kind of II legs there's a knee legs to go to hell there's no legs go to heaven there's an electic 144,000 there's an elective sealed you and there's an elect given eternal life at one time judgment okay because what is the election that word actually says the elect hath obtained it and the rest were blinded all right so there's a remnant Paul had to bring a remnant in because remember the 120 a Upper Room and probably close to all the Christians in the early church age were Jews all the ones in the upper end were Jews 120 in the upper room now 3,000 they received there were heathens they were they were Gentile many nations and they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the 120 epigram were called to take that message out so they were Jews and they started in Jerusalem if you read your Bible they started in Jerusalem and worked their way out all right so that's what he's saying right here Israel have not obtained that which you seek depart now Israel knew they were God's people because I've told him everything but they thought they were married to him they were not once they went prostituting herself out he had two didn't kill them he wrote a variety of divorcement and put them away never for them to be alive again but there is a remnant that hath obtained it now see the 144,000 he's in a whole group by itself but they don't receive the Holy Ghost here all right the fish still Jew didn't receive eternal life here or they would be bribed they're not right they received it in another dimension in another time element the cup of water in my name and the foolish virgin they didn't receive white robes here they will receive white robes it's a white throne judgment okay am i right for that so he's got a lot of different people in a lot of different places but we're talking about Israel the rest were blinded God put his hand over their eyes he blinded them but watch he's interpolating according it is written God had given them the spirit of slumber eyes the tissue of not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day I'm bringing the present unto this day and so today the Jews are over there in Jerusalem looking for my side God literally blinded those people's eyes so that you now can be grafted in now God didn't kill the tree he grafted us in you don't kill the tree watch go didn't tell you I mean spirit slumber I hear so should not hear until the two today right here and David said let their table be made a snare trap and a stumbling block and erect a fence unto them excuse me let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back all the way I say then man here's Paul I say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid but rather through their fall our transgression our God putting them away are them saying let his blood be on us and our children all that salvation has come to the Gentiles because they do not we'll look at this afternoon but I'll just give you law we've said this before but in the seventy weeks of Daniel seventy weeks are determined between the beginning to wind God restores the Jews back gives full ghosts 144,000 that's the seventy weeks of Daniel without the in gravity of the Gentiles that's the way it would look this is all Jews right when he grafted the Gentiles in this is what he done sixty-nine weeks one week he grafted in two thousand years with Gentile Church age okay which is all Gentile that started out to you here but hardly any to you now so Saul by Gentile Church age so what is this this is the grafted part this is the olive tree this is the olive tree okay didn't heal the tree you just graphed it in a Gentile bride because she can't be the bride anymore because right that's where she turned him down let his blood be on us in our children God even he back here in the Old Testament them away he knew what they were doing now he's going to restore them back here but not to the same position that we're here because he can't divorce a wife make somebody else and then same live over again hey do that why because the Bible says the land that's been polluted right everybody got that my marriage and divorce is really important because it covers everything Daniel 70 which covers all of the seals that's my brother one had to preach it right correct before you got started okay now watch have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid now see you say well they did yeah they fell from a position but they didn't fall completely in other words God didn't like I said God didn't kill the tree right here no you can't kill the tree even the root the very roots are the tree we live off of because the grass did you can grab any branch you won't do in a tree but it lived off the life of the roots that comes up through that tree Sophia would have killed the whole tree that's why our spiritual heritage in Jewish now I don't bear on where we need to be as you know we're not we're dead I don't try to be something the one God ever speaks for them we need to get the spiritual part it compares our spiritual understanding in a whole Old Testament about how God come in and crafted these Gentiles in cuz it tells us in the Old Testament there was a wild olive branch this was the wild olive branch we've allowed you think Israel was wild well they were pretty wild but we were Gentiles we didn't care so through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy right okay because the Jews are jealous of us they're jealous of everything else but now watch now if the fall of them be the riches of the world boy even though and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness form I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the upon the Gentiles I magnify my office the Lord Hill was the door open till the Gentiles Peter open that door God started and then Paul come in and became the church a messenger to the Gentile age called Ephesus the Alpha bride or the output church if by any means I may provoke to emulation or strive then which are my flesh and might save some of them now what's he saying is he said I'm going to the Gentiles but I don't want to make my friends mad I want to bring them into I want to save some of them no where's what's he saying I don't want you know well this were one more no more and I said you know no he he still preach to the Jews remember all he kept going back to Jerusalem he kept going back to this place kept going back to that place crying stable they just kept stone him and throwing him out throwing him over them you know won't be killing him but he kept going back for him to casting away of them be the reconciling of the world but what shall the receiving of them be but life from dead so in other words I'm gonna cast them out if you cast them away you've killed the tree you still gotta live off the tree so but laugh from the dead for you the first fruit be holy go ahead for him to first root be holy the lump also the public and if the Ruth be holy nor the Branson's nobody over that that's what that scripture said and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree worked grafted in among them and with them for take us of the root and fatness of the olive tree so all this right here this this great tree bribe tree brother Graham talking about it's attached to the roots of the Jews the promises of God okay well we don't have to live think about testing the Old Testament no that's the very root of our Christianity is the ten commandments we just see a higher form of that in the opening the seals and all the word this guy cuz then the ten commandments if you commit adultery you broken one of the commandment Jesus said if you commit adultery up there you've broken one we come out all right boast not against the branch but if that most thou bear it's not the root but the root bear bears thee and that's what happens thou wilt say then the branches are broken off that I might be grafted in well because of unbelief they were broken off so my Jesus and thou standest by faith found no greater faith and is really except what the Gentile be not high-minded but fear no where's he's talking to both sides Gentiles don't you be throwing that now God married us and divorced almond Jews you don't say well we still got people and y'all don't know why talking about because you think this my son already coming and we think he's that guy here yet where if God spared not the natural branch okay take this heed lest he also spare not thee because we didn't when he cut these branches off he couldn't just threw them off and they died you know you can prune branches and throw them over in a pile and eventually you have burning because they died but if you'll take them things and stick them in the ground or put them back into a tree what does it David brings life back again that's what happened because look what happened even this wild olive branch is so wild God's married her but he's not forgot the rest of the branches or the tree he's not forgot that I've got something coming that I want to talk about is the Millennium right see the Millennium is a time for this a Jewish time not I can't town town that's right it's a Jewish time it's just for the Jews they still in the Sabbath church age are of the seventh day so that's a thousand years of Sabbath for the land okay for the land you'll remember we talked about the land when we come back 970 weeks and all those we come up the land well that's why there is has never been a millennium God promised a millennium and yes somebody's going to leave a thousand years but and that's okay that's all right to say that but the millennium is to the Jews for the Jews the son of David is going to sit on the throne with twelve tribes the day that's gonna blossom like a road everything is going to come back to and even like I said even like condition so they won't be eaten until the new city comes but it will be an eden-like condition to where the Jews and the Gentiles are gonna live in harmony for a thousand years on this earth because I'll read it to you and I read it to you Wayne tonight God said I'm gonna disperse you throughout all the nations but one day I'm bringing you back to this lamp wine that little spot over in Jerusalem why that little piece of land because he give it to Abraham he told Abraham wherever the soles of your feet go that's where I'm gonna give you so they all got up in 1949 50 and 60 and 70 and 80 and 90 in two thousand two thousand ten thousand two thousand eighteen the Jews are slowly coming back because the 144,000 has got to be somewhere close they don't have to be sitting around the middle of Jerusalem but they got to be inside that little area they got to give back around now remember anyway I went to Egypt he went to Iraq Iran so I said 144,000 are not just going to beat those Orthodox Jews no it's going to be the children of Israel the children of the 12 tribes Reuben Benjamin dr. Lee and all of all the 12 tribes but because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high-minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee behold therefore let me get that off of there alright behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee in other words that severity would be severe let's see what after tomia rigor roughness he dell roughly with us because they played the part of the Laurita this afternoon again those of you that were named Wednesday night or didn't watch it we're gonna read it Jenna wins these I mean from wayne's people today and then add a little bit to it but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise there I also shall be cut off hmm so in other words don't crow over here in the turn changes because you know what the Bible says I'll put you live out brother it's gonna start the church ages the church age instead you've got a little bit of life but if you keep going like you're going I'm gonna snuff your candle out all right so let's don't boast it while we're in this comfort zone okay no we're not a comfort zone no we still got to alive by God's grace and His Word yes yes because you got to remember God didn't ever grab the denomination anywhere yes he grafted his people it was history did he grabbed it from cause remember it reading a Bible there's there's a there's a part of Bible and things in Ezekiel that he's called the branch okay he's the root and offspring of David now he's the root not spring a day but that's where everything comes from yes but what he's gonna do he took the kingdom away over here but he's gonna set David right back up in the Millennium with the twelve tribes you and I are there for nothing else than just a honeymoon where you know go take a week off take a cruise you know in other words what I'm saying think of vacation y'all have fought through 2000 years I got a deal here just a little while with my Jewish friends all right and when it's all over I'm gonna just wipe the whole world all them kill each each other because remember this is not this is atomic fire this is not holy fire this when we come back into millennium this building could still be here it's not gonna wipe everything off now the new city everything's locked up coming back into millennium know we'll still that still be buildings it's just an atomic destruction before they don't it but now when that new heaven new earth comes down God's gonna refigure the whole earth I believe he's going to refigure it back to where the flood before the flood right back to the Garden of Eden okay cuz remember when the new city is gonna push up front it's gonna push up over there in Jerusalem at the very spot where Abraham milk as he took communion plus eight lanes did not Abraham look for that city all his life and it was right under his feet about 200 feet below it that rock pyramid rock sitting right there blundering right now right now I believe what brother NC I believe doc told you must work with that robber Abraham and Melchizedek met and done communion verse 23 and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed it in another word unbelievable gets you graphed it out Belial gets you grabs it in God is able to graft them in again yes again yes he cut the tree off him and he's David he grafted in the Gentiles he still got life mm-hmm they're over here the ranchers are coming back in for you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and weren't grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more you see you see what he said this was the good on the tree God took the good olive tree took the wild by nature which is us grafted us into that good branch like I said he didn't grabbed it into a dead tree right all right he grabs didn't rot into a good tree right here we're gradually contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branch look be grafted into their own olive tree there's 144,000 grab the drop back in these over here didn't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul but God promised these right here he's known when he grasped it back again these are going to receive the Holy Ghost just like you and I they'll receive the new birth they'll be born again all right yeah by right with that so you see what I'm talking about yes sir you're right what a mighty God we search for I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery what's the mystery that God could take a wild olive branch they didn't care nothing about you make such a wonderful tree out of it but he grafted them into the good tree to start with okay he didn't grass it into a bad dream he grabbed it into a good trip all right well I would not brother that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come that's why God graphed it in the Gentile he blinded their eyes at Calvary so that you and I could come in but he's not gonna forget her he's coming right back to 144,000 NT you gotta do prophets and like I said Wednesday night now we got to remember let's don't be so narrow-minded and I've always said there's only going to be 144 thousand nine hundred four thousand to one I may want to change that a little bit but God said 144,000 that's men that's men the women and children that are attached to that could be can make that double but the landings is always with the male not to female this way the signs of Jada not the daughters of Jacob the sons of Jacob are the children of Israel are the children of Jacob when we say children of Israel what do you think of you think of all no it's the 12 children they take a ladder and then God change Jacob's name to wipe his room so it's the children of Israel is those 12 tribes God's never got away from the 12 tribes those 12 tribes because you know what he's gonna put a rock back in order right here remember remember they're out of order even now history right who is it Joseph in somebody else you got put back in got put in because Dan and somebody else got took out reach the steelbook of a region rich book but when you come back to the Bible right here everything's put it right back in order because you've got you twelve tribes three on each side three three three in the city and then you got to leave on us right here so that would be 13 tribes really but it's 12 tribes 3 6 9 12 and to leave us in the middle me and you mean you cuz in a new city who's going to be there the 12 tribes and the brother and we live in here that's true they bring their tithes into the city just like they did to leave us these would go out and do that do whatever and bring their tithes right back in but the 144,000 are not going to be the bride their servant does if you're reading in you City it says three tribes on this side three tribes that's the way it was sent up when the ark was put in the middle right well that Ark is me and you that's where the Holy Ghost fell right so that's what the whole the dosage is now it's in their City so everything's wonderful top if you just kind of look that way okay wonderful top let's finish this up and so all Israel shall be saved now remember pay attention not all the Israel is Israel so you gotta go back to what he said in Chapter nine ten recent on all these rules Israel so when he says all Israel shall be saved anything may ever person is over there in that city of Israel is gonna be safe no only the elect as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from who Israel Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins now the only time they're gonna take away that stand is what we're gonna talk about this afternoon the six fold purpose day of seventy weeks takes the sand away from Israel makes an industry erectus Aviation for iniquity back okay so he's restoring them back and that's the covenant will be under live what they deliver and you're going to turn ungodliness from Jacob for this is not coming on them when I shall take the winter sin added according sorry as concerning the gospel they are enemies of God for your sake Israel is an enemy of God for your safe but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's day that's the elect for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance for as he in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief through the youth unbelief you've received mercy right but remember grace is still there grace for the Jews are still there because if not then you start doing your laundry list of work all right even so have these also now not believe that through your mercy coming out to the end of the Gentile dispensation that through your mercy they without us cannot be made perfect today they also may obtain mercy 144,000 and the Millennium that's their mercies coming back in for God have concluded them all and unbelief that he might mercy have mercy upon all oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God there's grace how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out because you know what regular world doesn't understand one did you just like what we explained just now if you would have told them tell the world that they would not believe about half of it's me Calise how do you know and all this than that but see we had a prophet to help us put scripture together I said helpless the whole girls are the only one who can put three but he helped us put the scripture together so that we can see that man that wild olive branch was the Gentiles it come from the Jews so God can't forget the Jew there's still life there and then what he's gonna do he's gonna take that wild olive branch and what's he gonna do he's gonna harvest it take it in a rapture leave the tree there for the hundred forty four thousand for the last week of dang Cindy weeks then a millennium that's where you gonna say that tree blossom outta here all right for who have known the mind of the Lord in other words who can figured this out that's right really we wouldn't because we look back at their own dick just like I said Wednesday night there'd be no grace which they kill you know or who has been his counselor in other words God doesn't have to go to a second or third person and go hey what do you think about one of these in today no and God's not that way that's right because he's already saying it you already know you so that's just kind of the way things it's just perfect that one or who has first given to him nobody gives got a suggestion no and it shall be recompense unto him again in other words I gotta redo this thing let me rethink don't rethink that's what's great he don't rethink nothing for of him and through him and to him are all things the case sums it all up to whom for for above him and through him and to him now that covers your home that covers all of them to whom be glory forever amen just watch what he's dis next I'm gonna read this and then we'll go I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God was the will of God his word that's your holy all the will of God is his word you don't know what God's thinking was looking about right all right yes yes he's alive God is the life Israel is not the life of the tree God is the life of the tree they know him as Jehovah we know him as Jesus Christ they won't know him as Jesus Christ when we come back in two millennia there's not gonna be anybody alive do you hear me there's not gonna be anybody alive that's gonna wonder do go to yes don't be no demons they'll be there but they'll brother Ram said there'll be no words you won't be able to work to anybody that's why the millenniums different from the future home the millennium is nothing but man killing each other okay wiping the earth off that's coming back into millennium the demons are still here Satan still alive but when the end of that thousand years comes when judgment comes they're all thrown in the lake of fire where souls will be killed so he'll kill all those imps and and cancer demons and all the things all those things man completely done away with and that's why the future home and the millennium you can use scripture for the same one but there's some time in there you got separated there will be in the millennium not sinners or sin but it'll still be there somewhere because they remember the end of the millennium at the end of the millennium Satan brings his people together and tries to destroy us that's when God destroys those demons so the demons are still there they just have done the work on I mean me and you're standing board by body when they gotta work on it's done been destroyed in you but now it's not being destroyed everybody else there's still questions brother branham can there be with children born in the millennium looks like the can looks like the game so that's what he's it so you know what I'm saying is though and the Millennial there's a lot of things that's gonna go on but in the future home it's pretty cut and dry you see it you'll push up will come down on top of that new city and we'll live there with no all sins don't have things out of here but now in the Millenium you know they might be a little few things that goes on there you know what whatever we gotta get something here first before we can go there so look we're gonna start with chapter 12 not next time you turning sunny so we will be here when you're not going I'll be preaching lychee nuts so but we won't have Turks Sunday and so it'll be the next next year yeah what the hell service Monday night but he won't be able to have pleasure all right young brain for at least equal tears today care home how he's doing Pizza don't quick here this morning daddy's daddy got a miracle he's doing bed one better than he was today be treated today
