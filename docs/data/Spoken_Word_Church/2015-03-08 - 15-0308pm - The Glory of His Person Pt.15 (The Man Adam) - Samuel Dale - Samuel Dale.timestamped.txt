[11:23] the heavenly father we thank you lord
[11:26] jesus
[11:27] that you lord would
[11:30] thank enough about us
[11:33] that you would come to earth and die for
[11:35] our place

[11:39] as to what you would desire for us to be
[11:42] we ask you to just help us now and give
[11:44] us understanding ears
[11:47] as to the things that are spoken
[11:50] and why we look to you the author and
[11:52] finisher
[11:53] of those things
[11:55] each one lord remember the sick among us
[11:58] you said you sent your
[12:00] word and healed us and delivered us from
[12:01] destruction so just have your way
[12:04] guide us now forgive our sins
[12:07] cleanse us and keep us
[12:09] in jesus name
[12:11] amen
[12:14] revelations
[12:18] 1
[12:19] 12 and 13
[12:22] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[12:24] with me and being turned i saw seven
[12:27] golden candlesticks
[12:28] and in the midst of the seven
[12:30] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[12:32] man clove with a garment down to the
[12:34] foot and gird about the palps with a
[12:36] golden girdle
[12:38] now let's go to
[12:41] genesis
[12:44] 2 and 7.
[12:49] try to get all of these together if we
[12:50] can in
[12:52] the message
[12:54] and the lord god formed man
[12:56] of the dust of the ground
[12:58] and breathed into his nostrils and he
[13:00] became
[13:02] into his nostrils of breath of life and
[13:04] he became a living soul
[13:07] now
[13:08] let's go over to
[13:11] the familiar scriptures with most of us
[13:14] when you're talking about chapter 15
[13:17] but i want you to think about it and go
[13:19] into verse 45.
[13:23] not we're not trying to deal with all
[13:25] about the body part and all but
[13:27] to deal with this part of 45
[13:30] through 47
[13:32] and so it is written
[13:34] the first man adam was made a living
[13:37] soul
[13:39] the life's ma diced adam was made a
[13:42] quickening spirit
[13:45] howbeit which means nevertheless
[13:48] you know
[13:50] that was not first
[13:52] which is spiritual
[13:55] but that which is natural
[13:57] and after that which is spiritual all
[13:59] right now that does not mean that the
[14:02] physical occur we know the spiritual
[14:04] come first but it means that when he's
[14:06] coming on over in the flesh all right
[14:08] now
[14:09] the first man is the
[14:12] is of the earth earthy the second man is
[14:16] the lord from heaven you may be seated
[14:18] the lord at his blessing
[14:20] to the reading of the word as i said
[14:21] don't mix that up where it sounds like
[14:24] it's going
[14:25] backwards and forth
[14:28] get the text of what things are doing
[14:31] we were trying last night to
[14:33] uh speak a little bit there in romans
[14:36] of where paul
[14:38] was
[14:39] talking about the things i would i do
[14:42] not the things i do i would not
[14:44] and
[14:45] i told you the background he brought was
[14:47] the first part
[14:48] so when you see the background part and
[14:50] then you get all what's going on
[14:53] then you can finally
[14:55] understand what's being said
[14:57] and what's going on
[14:59] now what was our thought this morning
[15:03] that we were trying to get to
[15:05] when we were talking about the soul
[15:08] man you know
[15:10] we were trying to get the point to word
[15:12] that we could look at it and get
[15:13] understanding
[15:15] how that
[15:18] this man that is created in genesis 1 26
[15:21] and 27
[15:23] is the spiritual man
[15:26] all right
[15:28] then genesis 2 7 was a physical man
[15:31] all right
[15:32] now in getting that together then we
[15:35] understand
[15:36] and we don't try to cross over which one
[15:39] is what we try to keep it in the right
[15:41] place
[15:43] and you forgive me for blowing my nose
[15:45] because i can't help that part
[15:48] because it
[15:50] i can't reach up in there and turn it
[15:52] off and then when you do reach up in
[15:55] there and turn it off when it's trying
[15:56] to run it's going to clog up and you've
[15:57] got a headache so which one's the best
[16:00] all right i may run out of handkerchiefs
[16:02] at a while but i've got a bunch laying
[16:03] up here
[16:05] all right
[16:07] but now remember what our thought was
[16:11] that the genesis 1 26 man
[16:15] even though you can use that as an
[16:18] example of
[16:19] saying that all mankind
[16:22] is a special creation
[16:25] you know everybody in the world
[16:28] and that they you know are in the
[16:30] image form of god in the fact that they
[16:33] are little creators you know and even
[16:36] though they're in the fallen estate
[16:39] they still have those things you know
[16:41] that they can make a better car make a
[16:43] better home do all kind of things
[16:45] but the point was that this man of 126
[16:48] and 27 was a special built man
[16:51] this man was made and it was made
[16:55] male and female
[16:57] right now you remember that created he
[17:00] them
[17:01] male and female created he him
[17:05] all right it comes back to one
[17:08] point
[17:09] all right and see i believe now that
[17:11] this man is
[17:14] the point of what we've been talking
[17:15] about
[17:18] that god is coming down to
[17:21] you know for us
[17:24] to understand
[17:26] his descending
[17:28] and how that he came
[17:30] and you remember how we had the drawing
[17:31] up of showing the things that was on
[17:33] this side
[17:35] over here and then in the line that we
[17:37] talked about eternity and then uh what
[17:39] was on the other side would be over into
[17:42] this part here and and life and uh in
[17:47] doing it see then that was the way god
[17:49] condescended
[17:51] and he came down as to be the word the
[17:54] son of god
[17:56] all right
[17:57] and he then would create and he would
[17:59] create a man in his image
[18:03] in his likeness exactly like him
[18:07] now to me that's not a secondary man or
[18:10] another person
[18:12] you might think it is it's all right
[18:14] that's your choice
[18:16] but as i was trying to explain this
[18:18] morning remember all mankind
[18:20] is not made male and female
[18:23] a little baby born
[18:24] it's not made male and female
[18:27] you know
[18:28] that's not you know
[18:30] that's not the way it is because
[18:33] all mankind even though
[18:37] you could say all souls were created
[18:39] before the foundation of the world is
[18:42] right
[18:43] in the mind of god he knew ever soul
[18:45] would ever come into the world
[18:47] every being every person everything he
[18:49] knew that or he wasn't god
[18:51] all right
[18:52] but just knowing that would mankind
[18:55] would come doesn't put us into
[18:58] any uh special category it just lumps us
[19:01] in with everything
[19:03] and we did after when you come on down
[19:06] after the fall and you're coming through
[19:09] then you see that then all mankind is
[19:13] you know
[19:15] going to come forth and all mankind
[19:17] would have been in the mind of god and
[19:19] by his foreknowledge
[19:21] he would know
[19:22] who would accept jesus christ and who
[19:24] wouldn't we'll get to those things as we
[19:27] proceed a little further trying to hold
[19:30] the point like this morning that was
[19:32] speaking about the creation of one man
[19:35] which was the man
[19:36] adam all right
[19:39] and technically you know
[19:42] i know brother random uses it as that
[19:44] but you go in there technically his name
[19:46] was not given unto him as adam until he
[19:49] was made in flesh it doesn't give a name
[19:53] to this man of 126-27
[19:58] right
[20:00] and we talk about that and we don't have
[20:01] any problem with saying that eve
[20:05] you know that eve never received her
[20:07] name until she failed
[20:10] then she was called the mother of all
[20:12] living because it would not have been
[20:14] uh complimentary to give her
[20:17] the name eve
[20:19] while she was in adam
[20:22] it just says woman
[20:24] right
[20:25] no name all right so now is it with adam
[20:29] that the 126 man doesn't have a nametag
[20:31] to
[20:32] it because the name would signify coming
[20:36] into earth
[20:37] and being you know upon the earth and
[20:40] being uh mankind or man
[20:43] all right so it wouldn't
[20:45] it wouldn't have any
[20:47] relation so you wouldn't be doing that
[20:49] so then i believe the 126 27 and 28
[20:53] going on over into 28 you pick up a
[20:55] little more
[20:56] that that is the spiritual man
[21:00] because that's the way the prophet
[21:01] brought it out so he said well you know
[21:03] we'll read the quote in just a minute
[21:04] where he he put it over in
[21:07] all right but the 126 man then would be
[21:09] a spiritual creation in the image of god
[21:13] the genesis 2
[21:14] 7 man
[21:16] the flesh man
[21:17] is in the image of animals
[21:20] all right
[21:21] see then that would put it into the
[21:23] point but i hope you follow that point
[21:26] in your thinking
[21:27] that
[21:28] you know
[21:29] and it'll help you to understand
[21:32] to see that all mankind was not made in
[21:35] genesis 1 26-27
[21:37] that would have been a special man and
[21:39] really i'm trying my best to get you to
[21:41] see
[21:42] that that's one man
[21:46] we have to start with adam
[21:49] but this man adam that we start with
[21:52] was made different than any other man
[21:54] that would ever come into the earth
[21:57] you know outside the lord jesus christ
[21:59] himself
[22:00] because this man would come
[22:03] as to be
[22:05] male and female
[22:08] all right
[22:10] because in the theophany or the soul the
[22:12] being
[22:13] that was created in 126 and 27 it would
[22:17] be
[22:18] in the basis that once adam was placed
[22:21] into i'll get to that the lord willing
[22:23] wednesday once he was placed in two
[22:26] flesh
[22:27] that flesh man was lonely because part
[22:29] of his being was still
[22:31] somewhere else the way the prophet
[22:33] describes it all right so that would
[22:35] make it uh the word it would give us
[22:38] understanding
[22:40] of what we're doing
[22:42] all right now
[22:43] this man that is created
[22:48] we look at him as seeing him
[22:51] in a very special form
[22:53] because of his creation and the ability
[22:55] of what he was and the things
[22:58] and
[22:59] this
[23:00] person
[23:01] if we look at it correctly i wrote this
[23:03] in my notes where i'd remember to make
[23:05] sure three times
[23:07] and i wrote it one more time or whatever
[23:09] to say but you'd say brother dale
[23:12] you're seemingly trying to make the 126
[23:14] and 127 man
[23:19] god
[23:22] well
[23:24] what can you make it
[23:26] that's right
[23:30] it is certainly not a physical situation
[23:35] right
[23:37] and it's certainly not physical man
[23:42] it's uh
[23:43] you know i noticed this morning that i
[23:45] got to preach in a while didn't blow as
[23:46] much so help pray for me on that
[23:49] all right
[23:53] i know what i can do to stop it but that
[23:55] wouldn't work too good
[23:57] and the lord has always made me kind of
[23:59] funny to differ to everybody else my
[24:01] wife was telling the doctor about it the
[24:03] other day i'm a different person i know
[24:06] all the way but
[24:07] especially in that that
[24:09] if if you have a bad cold and you lay
[24:11] down at night you get sicker
[24:13] i have a bad cold and i'm sniffling and
[24:15] i'm coughing i go lay down we'll put my
[24:18] head down i stop
[24:23] ask boyd about your breathing machine
[24:24] you can't stay on it when your nose is
[24:26] stopped up
[24:28] mine just running like everything i was
[24:29] on it last night
[24:31] because as destroyed maybe god made me
[24:33] where i could sleep
[24:35] i thank him for that all right
[24:37] but now think
[24:41] this man
[24:43] if this man is in the image of god
[24:46] then it's not and i keep emphasizing
[24:49] that where you'll remember it
[24:51] it's not like something in the image of
[24:54] something
[24:56] it's like the creation
[24:59] all right and then
[25:01] the rest of the creation
[25:04] okay
[25:06] see it's the same person
[25:09] in another form
[25:11] all right
[25:13] trinitarianism she won't work
[25:16] but it's the same god in another form
[25:19] father son and holy ghost is not three
[25:20] gods
[25:22] is god revealed in three manifestations
[25:27] uh three offices three
[25:29] whatever you want to put to it to to
[25:31] help your understanding but it's the
[25:33] same god
[25:35] amen well i i believe now that this
[25:38] genesis 2 uh genesis 1 26 man
[25:42] is the very
[25:44] one that
[25:46] created
[25:48] moved over in another form
[25:52] and it would be called the offspring of
[25:55] god
[25:57] that way you remember how i was bringing
[25:59] it out and just a little thought we'll
[26:01] pick some of that up later
[26:03] that
[26:04] all souls being created before the
[26:07] foundation of the world
[26:09] and a lot of that is just in the mind of
[26:11] god
[26:12] but it's not so with the real true
[26:14] offspring of god
[26:18] because that's the eternal life
[26:20] i hope you'll get one point i wrote it
[26:22] in my notes at the end
[26:24] i hope you get one point out of what i'm
[26:26] trying to bring
[26:29] all right
[26:30] and that one point is
[26:32] that
[26:34] if we can get this in the correct order
[26:36] of understanding who we are
[26:39] by the new birth
[26:42] brings our soul
[26:44] back to the position
[26:46] that it should have been
[26:51] now you are following me by the new
[26:53] birth it brings our soul
[26:56] back to the position that should have
[26:58] been
[26:59] had there not been a fall
[27:03] you want me to get that one we're
[27:04] running brother branham i believe it's
[27:08] uh spoken word original seed where he
[27:10] said being born by the word and spirit
[27:12] brings you back like it should have been
[27:14] in the original he said i just caught
[27:16] that
[27:18] if you remember the quote there's
[27:19] something similar to that
[27:21] all right
[27:22] and see think about it now
[27:26] this man is a special man and if it is
[27:30] not god creating something separate from
[27:32] himself
[27:35] then this man here would be
[27:38] what was supposed to have been
[27:40] for all the offspring of god
[27:44] the children of god
[27:46] you see then that way it would be god
[27:49] coming into manifestation
[27:52] you say yeah but that's making us god
[27:55] i wish i could get it to you
[27:58] you know enough to where you would
[27:59] realize who you
[28:00] are and then we can have faith in what
[28:03] we are
[28:05] all right
[28:06] because i'm not putting any any uh
[28:09] glory or anything upon
[28:12] anything else other than god himself
[28:14] because that's where i have to put it
[28:17] all right
[28:18] so this man now
[28:20] of 126 and 27
[28:23] was the part of god
[28:27] that came out of god
[28:30] right
[28:33] part of his being
[28:36] part of his person
[28:39] and part of his very
[28:41] soul
[28:43] our being
[28:46] that's what i believe about the 126-27
[28:48] man
[28:52] then it would be no problem to
[28:54] understand
[28:55] how when we get to it in a little bit in
[28:57] blasphemous names
[28:59] when that that
[29:00] you can take
[29:02] one the 20-26 man put it into the 2-7
[29:05] man
[29:06] and brother branham says
[29:09] he breathed into his nostrils and he
[29:11] became an eternal person
[29:14] with god
[29:21] see that's where we're going in the
[29:22] message so you you listen to it
[29:25] all right
[29:26] the very part remember we covered how
[29:28] that brother brown said a part of god
[29:30] went out
[29:31] he said it's not like an arm falling off
[29:34] it's not like a doing this
[29:36] it simply means god moved into another
[29:38] form
[29:41] right
[29:42] all right
[29:43] see then this is just the expanding of
[29:45] god
[29:49] adam is going to come into being
[29:52] now listen and you think about it
[29:56] adam is going to come into being
[29:59] in the way we're trying to bring it
[30:01] because that's what he did
[30:03] has to be an eternal person
[30:12] that's the way the prophet brought it so
[30:15] now what are we doing because adam is
[30:17] going to be the example son
[30:22] see then the first man adam
[30:25] as we read in corinthians
[30:27] was made a living soul
[30:33] the second man adam which is who jesus
[30:36] christ
[30:38] has made a quickening spirit
[30:40] the god of glory
[30:42] all right
[30:44] it's just defining it and showing it as
[30:46] it would come into being as to what god
[30:48] is actually doing
[30:50] and he shows exactly what he wants
[30:56] in adam
[30:58] right
[31:00] was he not god of the earth
[31:07] god is the god of glory of heaven but
[31:09] he's god demands to be god of the earth
[31:12] all right
[31:13] that's our domain that's why that even
[31:15] the animals
[31:17] the most ferocious
[31:19] of the animals
[31:22] is afraid of the mankind
[31:26] because that was the way it was created
[31:28] he was created to be his ruler
[31:31] his master and his doings all right
[31:33] now
[31:34] so what is the soul of man it's the
[31:36] being the person who he is
[31:41] and this then would not be god
[31:43] uh creating a person
[31:49] he created the body yeah
[31:52] it had a beginning right
[31:56] right
[31:57] and you know if it's got a beginning
[31:58] it's going to have an ending
[32:00] that's right then adam's body
[32:03] where he where he messed up he fell the
[32:05] prophet gave it in the
[32:07] seal book
[32:08] and we'll get to that later he said
[32:11] he fell from eternal life right to death
[32:17] now before we get there and even talk
[32:19] about that are you going to think that
[32:21] god gave adam eternal life and then took
[32:23] it away from him and sent him to hell
[32:25] because if he didn't have eternal life
[32:27] he goes to hell
[32:31] right
[32:34] well you better define what you're
[32:36] talking about
[32:38] adam fell from the ability to come forth
[32:40] into eternal life
[32:44] he never fell from eternal life like
[32:46] having it falling away from it because
[32:48] you can't do that
[32:50] god is not an indian giver do we believe
[32:53] that
[32:54] what so think about this special person
[32:58] and i titled the message
[33:00] i'd always try to title it to get your
[33:02] attention if you're looking on the
[33:04] things or to anybody else
[33:06] and i titled it the man
[33:09] you know lock him into man
[33:13] adam
[33:15] because it's got to be the whole thing
[33:17] of coming into being to see what the
[33:19] original would be
[33:21] and how that original that would be
[33:24] would be what god would want from all of
[33:26] his children that's right
[33:31] you said but brother dale adam fell
[33:34] may i quote the prophet before we get
[33:35] there but when adam fell he had a
[33:37] sacrifice
[33:38] right
[33:39] right
[33:41] so now what are you going to deal with
[33:42] all right
[33:43] now watch the point as we're trying to
[33:45] get into it
[33:47] this then was not of genesis 1 26 and 27
[33:51] i say that to make sure that you you
[33:55] hang on to the one i'm talking about
[33:59] then it's not a creation like
[34:02] god created
[34:05] a man
[34:10] if he gives this man eternal life
[34:15] what was he intending to do to start
[34:17] with
[34:19] is not
[34:21] the point that you and i are supposed to
[34:23] come to eternal life
[34:25] by the new birth
[34:30] then if we are then
[34:34] what's the difference in how we came
[34:36] other than sure the sinful condition
[34:39] right that's that's in there but
[34:41] remember without that sinful condition
[34:43] entering the picture
[34:45] our god our creator would have never
[34:47] been able to display any of his
[34:48] attributes
[34:51] right
[34:53] so he knew what we would do
[34:56] but this first man adam
[34:59] was not made in a sinful condition
[35:03] even his body was made perfect
[35:07] now i didn't say eternal
[35:11] his body was made perfect
[35:14] because that was what it would turn out
[35:15] to be
[35:16] all right
[35:17] but the soul that would be put into that
[35:19] body
[35:22] is going to have to be eternal life
[35:26] or have eternal life any way you want to
[35:28] say it
[35:29] that's your point
[35:31] now remember then that this is not the
[35:34] creation of mankind
[35:37] because you would run into the trouble
[35:39] about having the male and female
[35:41] for every individual that would be
[35:43] created
[35:45] but this is the creation of adam
[35:49] in the basis of the what the part that
[35:51] he would be
[35:53] of this being
[35:55] that we're going to talk about you say
[35:58] this being yes
[36:00] this first son
[36:04] now we brought it down through right
[36:07] the first son of god was what
[36:11] not that god created jesus and jesus
[36:13] created everything else right
[36:15] you remember the first son was god's own
[36:18] creation
[36:19] coming into being that we could
[36:22] understand
[36:23] see then the first son would be the
[36:25] logos the theophany
[36:28] or god made manifest
[36:31] in another form called the word
[36:34] that could create
[36:37] all right
[36:39] then the soul of adam
[36:44] was the second son
[36:49] come on now you're supposed to remember
[36:51] all these things i don't have to
[36:52] repreach so much you remember
[36:55] about the last week or something we've
[36:57] quoted where brother brown said he gave
[36:58] birth to his son
[37:02] the word the logos the creator
[37:06] that was not god giving birth to another
[37:08] person that was god moving over into
[37:11] another into the same form i mean into
[37:13] that form
[37:15] and would be called
[37:16] a son
[37:19] all right or the son of god
[37:22] all right
[37:23] so now this second son
[37:26] what about him
[37:29] what about this second son that comes
[37:31] into being
[37:35] the 126 man come on here with me
[37:39] so if the first son
[37:42] was not a second person
[37:48] you agree
[37:50] it was the person in another form
[37:52] called the sun the word
[37:55] all right now if that be true
[37:58] then this second son
[38:02] would have to be that same god
[38:08] in another form
[38:12] called the son of god
[38:15] is that what the bible says about adam
[38:19] adam there was the son of god is that in
[38:21] the lineage over and probably in the
[38:23] matthews or somewhere when it brings
[38:25] into the lineages and you're going
[38:26] backward
[38:27] and you go back to adam which it says
[38:30] which was the son of god
[38:32] all right
[38:34] see then the very image of god
[38:37] or very person of god
[38:42] would then be stepping over into this
[38:44] man of 126 and 27 or that would be him
[38:48] that would be that
[38:51] and he would be then
[38:53] watch
[38:57] well let's just read it
[38:59] go ahead brothers pull up number
[39:01] one and let's read it
[39:05] see that's where i love to go to the
[39:06] prophet and ask him questions
[39:08] you know i mean here on i'm
[39:10] saying
[39:12] i need to know something on god's power
[39:15] transformation look what he says
[39:17] now this great creator had placed
[39:20] his created son
[39:22] now go back and find out what he's
[39:24] talking about and just go into a
[39:27] garden and a thing
[39:28] now adam was his first created son
[39:36] but but brother dale brother branham
[39:38] said that god was his first creation
[39:44] no
[39:47] now adam was his first created son watch
[39:52] jesus was his only begotten son
[39:57] see
[39:59] he was begotten by a woman
[40:04] but adam was
[40:06] right straight
[40:08] from the hand of god
[40:10] in creation
[40:16] now i'd be real careful there how i
[40:17] tried to handle that very much because
[40:22] remember jesus was begotten
[40:26] he was not created
[40:29] but yet he's called what in revelations
[40:31] 3 14.
[40:36] the beginning of the creation of god
[40:41] right
[40:42] right
[40:43] so he was begotten
[40:50] from a wound of a woman jesus was
[40:53] this man
[40:55] that he's talking about here
[40:58] is his created son
[41:01] the adam was his first created son
[41:08] but jesus was
[41:11] a begotten son adam was straight from
[41:13] the hand of god in creation
[41:16] then he covered how the bride is to be
[41:17] in the things but we don't want to try
[41:19] to get into those things
[41:21] we want to move on a little bit further
[41:22] going down to the next one
[41:25] which is but it wasn't so from the
[41:26] beginning 1961
[41:29] how many knows that god is like
[41:32] and when god became flesh and dwelt in
[41:35] the body that he created
[41:37] which was his only begotten son
[41:41] adam was his son
[41:43] a creative son but jesus was his
[41:47] begotten son he's trying to defy the
[41:49] difference in how that that came adam
[41:51] never came by wound
[41:53] right
[41:54] right
[41:56] adam came by creation
[41:59] all right
[42:00] so then who is this one that we're
[42:02] talking about
[42:07] who is he
[42:10] roll that up let me see if i can find
[42:12] the bottom part
[42:13] uh yeah
[42:15] now he's describing
[42:18] the coming down that jesus the son of
[42:20] god had the spirit without measure is
[42:22] that right
[42:24] but we have it by measure
[42:26] but it's the same
[42:29] spirit
[42:30] right
[42:34] right
[42:37] it's the same spirit
[42:39] what makes him the fullness
[42:42] by a new birth
[42:44] makes us
[42:48] part of that
[42:50] so that's where you're going to start
[42:51] off with adam right
[42:53] you say yeah but that's getting too
[42:55] close brother dale that's
[42:57] that's trying to make us a god
[43:00] well what's the problem
[43:04] right
[43:06] what's the problem with it
[43:08] let's just read a few things the prophet
[43:10] has said about this
[43:11] to see
[43:13] that
[43:13] he's even bringing it down to where we
[43:16] are now
[43:18] so what it would it be to start off in
[43:20] adam is we'll get back to him in a
[43:22] minute
[43:23] look at the next one number three which
[43:25] is progress 77
[43:27] of adoption
[43:29] he's the logos that went out of god that
[43:31] is true that was the son of god then he
[43:34] made man that little god
[43:38] okay and he said if they called those
[43:41] who the word of god came to
[43:44] the prophets they called them gods who
[43:45] the word of god came to and god said so
[43:48] himself that they were gods he told
[43:51] moses and the thing all right he made a
[43:53] man a god
[43:54] made man a god
[43:56] a god in his domain and his domain goes
[43:59] from sea to sea from shore to shore
[44:02] he has diver he has the control of it
[44:06] is it too bad to think about
[44:10] he goes on down in that same one to say
[44:13] verily i say unto you
[44:16] that's
[44:17] little gods
[44:21] you'll say to this mountain be moved and
[44:23] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[44:25] that what you've said will come to pass
[44:27] you can have what you've said
[44:29] amen
[44:31] all right
[44:34] even in the point of coming through the
[44:36] fallen condition
[44:38] do you know that that is the place that
[44:40] you and i are supposed
[44:42] you and i in this day because no other
[44:44] age could achieve it
[44:46] we're supposed to come to that
[44:48] place or are you like some
[44:52] that say
[44:55] and i could quote names but because i
[44:57] heard them say it but
[44:58] no need of it man said that the third
[45:01] pull is the for only brother branham and
[45:03] the lord jesus
[45:08] well everybody just glory glory glory
[45:11] then we don't have to worry about
[45:12] nothing
[45:14] right
[45:16] but i can't help but being able to
[45:17] remember
[45:20] where brother branham said the third
[45:21] pull
[45:23] was for the bride and the church
[45:30] and to the totally lost
[45:35] all right
[45:36] if you need that quote let me know
[45:41] i thought
[45:44] that
[45:46] the prophet coming was to
[45:49] bring the word for the bride
[45:52] to be made manifest
[45:54] i didn't know it was just for the
[45:56] prophet to be made manifest but it was
[45:58] to be
[45:59] for the whole thing
[46:00] right
[46:02] right you say what brother dale i just
[46:05] don't see
[46:07] well why don't you look around the whole
[46:08] world
[46:10] you see it's impossible for the ministry
[46:12] of brother branham to be back i differ
[46:14] with you
[46:15] but it's around the world it's not in
[46:17] one person no more
[46:20] it's not in one person anymore it's
[46:22] gonna have to be in the bride of christ
[46:23] around the world
[46:25] that's no excuse
[46:29] because we've seen what god has done
[46:32] here we've seen the sick healed we've
[46:34] seen the dead rays we've seen the storms
[46:37] spoken out of existence we've seen rain
[46:39] come at the words of someone speaking it
[46:41] we've seen many things
[46:43] that people don't want to credit that
[46:45] they want to put out just in some
[46:48] pentecostalism
[46:49] well that's all right
[46:51] i don't worry about it if you put it in
[46:52] pentecostalism because if you're going
[46:54] to put it in pentecostalism you're
[46:56] admitting
[46:59] that it happened that's right
[47:02] so now you're trapped
[47:05] with your own thinking
[47:07] right
[47:09] sorry
[47:10] just don't let that spirit get too
[47:11] offending at me okay
[47:14] don't let me become your enemy because i
[47:15] tell you the truth
[47:17] look what he goes on to say on the
[47:18] unfailing realities of the living god
[47:23] god always likes to work through men
[47:26] it's god's program to work through men
[47:29] do you believe that congregation says
[47:30] amen
[47:32] god works through men he made man his
[47:34] helper on earth
[47:36] he made man
[47:38] a lesser god
[47:41] than himself
[47:45] what would be a lesser god
[47:48] do we believe in
[47:50] the uh
[47:52] because that's what the word demon god
[47:54] comes to and if i've mispronounced that
[47:56] you put it in the right place and spell
[47:57] it
[47:59] a demon god is a lesser god
[48:03] and that's what they're saying today
[48:05] that jesus wasn't god the people of this
[48:08] message a lot of them because they're
[48:10] saying he become god on the river jordan
[48:12] then it left him in the garden and you
[48:14] know and then
[48:15] he died a man and this and the other
[48:17] that's a demon god
[48:20] that's a lesser god
[48:24] then when you come to the prophet he
[48:25] says no man can die like that man said
[48:28] it took god to hang on that tree and to
[48:30] do the things that he went through
[48:34] but yet that's people and their ideas
[48:36] see
[48:38] but he's a
[48:40] lesser god roll down up just a little
[48:41] bit further
[48:42] to the next part of that quote
[48:45] and when god made man in his own image
[48:48] he put him on the earth as a lesser god
[48:50] jesus declared it when he said
[48:52] is not it written in your laws that ye
[48:54] are god's
[48:56] and if they call those gods who the word
[48:58] of god come to which was the prophets
[49:01] how can you condemn me when i say i'm
[49:03] the son of god
[49:04] he said see they just couldn't
[49:06] understand but man was put here with a
[49:09] dominion over the earth he had
[49:11] everything under his control
[49:15] what about a lesser god
[49:20] what about these things we'll get this
[49:22] out of the way and then we'll drop back
[49:25] to our point
[49:26] of what we're talking about
[49:29] look at the next one which is
[49:32] god's provided
[49:35] way of approach number five
[49:39] the prophets were considered gods
[49:41] man was give give made a lesser god and
[49:45] given a dominion over the earth
[49:47] that's the reason that the world today
[49:48] is groaning waiting
[49:51] for the full manifestation
[49:53] of the sons of god
[49:56] right
[49:58] now if that's what the world is waiting
[50:00] for
[50:02] was not that what it started with
[50:08] are you with me
[50:10] was not adam the god of the earth
[50:15] till even he named the animals
[50:18] the things
[50:22] what about it
[50:25] oh there's a great deep and blessed
[50:27] teaching in that
[50:28] that someday
[50:30] man will still come back into his right
[50:34] place
[50:35] and his domain will be the earth
[50:37] and he will speak to the tree or to the
[50:40] mountain or to anything and it'll just
[50:42] go in place just like it was in intended
[50:46] to be
[50:47] we are fallen creation creatures
[50:50] creatures
[50:51] all right
[50:53] what about it then
[50:56] what about this man
[51:01] that was made there in the garden
[51:04] what about him
[51:06] do you see adam as he was god now let's
[51:09] don't come over the fall and get all we
[51:12] got to get it all you got to run ahead
[51:13] see that's that's just a human brain you
[51:16] got to you got to run ahead and show how
[51:18] smart we are when
[51:20] when a person tells you just stay with
[51:22] me
[51:24] you know i mean if i go so far and cut
[51:26] off then the rest of it you're going to
[51:28] be presuming of what i'm going to speak
[51:33] right right because i'm the one's got
[51:34] the notes
[51:36] so i just stay with the person that's
[51:38] trying to get you to understand
[51:40] well you don't want me to think i said
[51:42] something one time the brother said
[51:44] you telling me i can't write down what
[51:45] you said i said no i'm telling you you
[51:47] can't right fast enough
[51:51] because you can't ride as fast as i talk
[51:55] even the secretary typing has trouble
[51:57] right
[52:01] if you had the typewriter you might be
[52:03] able to follow me
[52:04] but try it sometimes follow writing it
[52:06] down because you see that's where people
[52:08] come to me and see that's why we keep
[52:10] the tapes
[52:11] i've had people to come to me and they
[52:13] said brother dale you said so and so i
[52:15] said no i didn't
[52:18] yes you did
[52:19] i heard you
[52:22] never said it
[52:26] yes we did okay we solved that problem
[52:29] we'll go get the tape and play it
[52:34] see whether i said it or not
[52:38] well i guess because they i guess they
[52:41] realized about that time that if i was
[52:43] willing to pull the tape i pretty well
[52:44] knew i didn't say it
[52:46] because it was something outlandish
[52:48] you're sitting there writing down and
[52:50] you hear me and you're trying to write
[52:52] down and i'm not saying for you not to
[52:54] write write little short notes and do
[52:56] things to keep up to get you back later
[52:58] but when you're sitting there writing
[52:59] and trying to write and i'm over here
[53:01] and i say and and i committed adultery
[53:05] and while you're saying
[53:08] he said he committed adultery
[53:11] well you didn't hear all before thee and
[53:13] what was the reason i was bringing that
[53:15] point
[53:16] that if i had went out and done
[53:18] something wrong with a woman i committed
[53:20] adultery
[53:22] all you hear he committed adultery
[53:25] that's what he said
[53:27] well maybe you should write short notes
[53:29] i write notes
[53:31] you ought to see my my notes i write
[53:33] notes
[53:35] and if you'll notice a lot of times
[53:38] preachers up here can see it you'll see
[53:40] me write it and aaron's shaking his head
[53:42] and i tear that off and stick in my
[53:44] pocket
[53:46] and i'll write something out there that
[53:47] i'll just a little short note
[53:51] all right
[53:52] cause you can't well
[53:54] forget it
[53:58] listen
[54:00] let's look at this man and get the
[54:02] thought and then we'll try to pick it up
[54:03] look at the next one the messiah
[54:06] which is 1961 paragraph 37.
[54:11] now we say in the man the man before i
[54:13] leave that subject the man what is he
[54:15] he's got a hand like god
[54:18] got eyes like god got ears like god
[54:21] got a body like god
[54:23] now you say well
[54:25] well god's not real
[54:28] okay
[54:31] he was fastened after god
[54:34] he was given an earth and a dominion he
[54:36] was made god over the earth to rule the
[54:38] earth a lesser god
[54:40] god rules the universe everything but
[54:43] man was given the earth
[54:45] to rule the earth he was he was a
[54:47] messiah
[54:49] that's what he is tonight if he gets
[54:51] back to god he is a messiah and a little
[54:53] messiah
[54:54] if he had
[54:56] if messiah means anointed one and we're
[54:59] anointed then what are you
[55:01] that's exactly right messiah we call it
[55:05] that just for the word's sake till we
[55:07] get to a little further down into the
[55:09] scripture all right so what's he talking
[55:12] about now
[55:16] why was this man created in genesis
[55:21] the 126.
[55:23] what was he made in genesis let's just
[55:24] read it and we'll let him do it go to
[55:26] the next one number seven which is off
[55:28] of the messiah the same message but it's
[55:30] paragraph 16.
[55:32] now isaiah 9 6 we just won't read it
[55:35] but he was to be the everlasting father
[55:37] to mighty god when god made man in
[55:40] genesis 1
[55:42] 26 it shows if you're putting that
[55:45] scripture down genesis 1 27.
[55:48] it shows that god made man to be a god
[55:52] to begin with
[55:55] he was made to be a god
[55:58] a lesser god
[55:59] he was made in the image
[56:01] and likeness of god
[56:03] he had hands like god he had feet like
[56:06] god eyes ears and intelligence like god
[56:09] his whole fiber because he was a son of
[56:11] god and jesus referred to him as god
[56:16] all right
[56:18] are you with me
[56:21] he goes on in the sardisian church age
[56:23] and said who is the god of the earth
[56:26] he said man
[56:28] that's his domain
[56:32] the earth
[56:34] belongs to man
[56:36] it was given to him and he was ruler
[56:38] over everything
[56:40] all nature's groaning waiting for that
[56:42] time
[56:43] when the sons of god will be manifested
[56:46] again oh my oh my manifestation of the
[56:48] sons of god
[56:53] and if you were only the prophets you'd
[56:55] be running into trouble but that's all
[56:56] right you keep your thoughts
[57:01] look at the breach
[57:03] paragraph 99
[57:07] when adam sinned he heeded his wife's
[57:09] reasoning instead of holding to to god's
[57:12] word
[57:13] that's what made adam sin
[57:16] his wife reasoned with satan and
[57:17] produced the product to adam and adam
[57:19] turned loose the word and sold out he
[57:22] lost all his inheritance when he lost
[57:25] his fellowship
[57:26] and right to life
[57:28] and we'll get back to these in the next
[57:30] message
[57:31] the day you eat there that day you die
[57:33] and when he lost his life he also lost
[57:35] his inheritance in life because he had
[57:37] completely supreme control of the earth
[57:40] he was a god of the earth
[57:42] god's the god of the universe everywhere
[57:45] but his son had this earth under his own
[57:47] control he could speak he could name he
[57:50] could say he could stop nature it could
[57:53] do anything he wanted to see
[57:56] but when he did that he lost his
[57:58] inheritance
[57:59] now adam could say let this mountain
[58:01] here be moved over the earth
[58:03] and it would do it adam could say let
[58:06] this tree here be plucked up and be
[58:09] planted over here
[58:10] it would do it for he had complete
[58:12] supreme control
[58:14] as a minor god
[58:17] under god our father because he was a
[58:20] son of god
[58:23] all right
[58:25] now
[58:26] is that enough to think about
[58:31] the point
[58:32] so we can get back to adam
[58:35] that this man adam
[58:37] was a special creation
[58:40] this man adam was made
[58:43] in the image of god
[58:49] he was made in theophany
[58:55] he was made a soul
[58:59] a person a being
[59:03] and that was what god would want all of
[59:05] his offspring to be
[59:10] it's to be like adam
[59:14] all right
[59:17] and adam would be the ruler of the earth
[59:21] because he's a son of god
[59:23] so it's not a second person
[59:27] it's just not god creating a man and
[59:30] calling him adam and then saying well
[59:32] i'm just going to let him run this
[59:36] if you're listening to what i've tried
[59:38] to bring this morning and i'm trying to
[59:39] bring now then you're seeing the point
[59:42] that this man that we're talking about
[59:45] and 27
[59:47] would have to be
[59:48] the offspring of god
[59:50] which would have to be god in another
[59:52] form called a son
[59:54] right
[59:56] which would not be a second person
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:02] he would be the person
[1:00:07] and that's the way he started his church
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:11] was to be that
[1:00:12] away oh yeah we'll get on the end of the
[1:00:15] fall how did it come out and how they
[1:00:17] were done
[1:00:18] but just i wish you would remember one
[1:00:20] thing too you said but brother dale
[1:00:22] you're talking about adam with eternal
[1:00:24] life how could he fall
[1:00:28] you have eternal life by the new birth
[1:00:34] why do you do wrong
[1:00:38] i don't do wrong bless god i am a son of
[1:00:41] god and i never had a wrong thought
[1:00:46] you might not but you had a lie come out
[1:00:48] of your mouth
[1:00:51] because even jesus
[1:00:54] satan tried his best to enter the mind
[1:00:56] of the lord jesus
[1:01:00] don't think that just because you're a
[1:01:02] christian that you can't do wrong
[1:01:05] that's right
[1:01:07] now you can't sin enough to be lost no
[1:01:11] but you can sin enough to get
[1:01:14] have to answer for it
[1:01:16] right
[1:01:17] there's going to be a correction
[1:01:18] somewhere
[1:01:19] all right
[1:01:21] but are you following me now get away
[1:01:22] from the notes to where i can
[1:01:24] talk about this man
[1:01:28] this man his name wasn't adam
[1:01:31] because he was given that when he was
[1:01:32] put in flesh
[1:01:36] this man would be
[1:01:40] what would make the man adam
[1:01:43] eternal
[1:01:47] once he's put into adam
[1:01:51] this would be a part of god
[1:01:54] an offspring of god
[1:01:58] that's why people can't understand it
[1:02:00] then do you believe any you believe in
[1:02:02] pre-existence or soul i believe in
[1:02:04] pre-existence of one soul that's the
[1:02:06] soul of almighty god
[1:02:10] then i believe
[1:02:13] and i've always tried to teach you
[1:02:15] that soul that i'm talking about
[1:02:20] is constantly expanding amen
[1:02:27] as he gives you a part
[1:02:29] of himself
[1:02:32] don't worry about it you're not going to
[1:02:33] run out of parts
[1:02:36] god i'm talking about with the 7 billion
[1:02:38] people that's in the world today i can't
[1:02:40] even calculate that much we used to talk
[1:02:42] about a million dollars and how big a
[1:02:44] room it would take to put all one dollar
[1:02:46] bills in it that was in school now
[1:02:47] million dollars they need nothing
[1:02:50] i can't even what is a billion it's a
[1:02:52] billion ten hundred thousand million
[1:02:57] thousand million okay we we get these
[1:02:59] scientific
[1:03:00] educated people a thousand million
[1:03:03] i can't even comprehend that
[1:03:06] but there's seven billion people in the
[1:03:08] world you know that god could give every
[1:03:09] person the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:03:12] he would be no less god when he got
[1:03:14] through
[1:03:16] right
[1:03:20] he would have more
[1:03:22] abilities
[1:03:25] right right you remember what is it
[1:03:27] there in the scriptures that that we
[1:03:29] can't do anything greater
[1:03:33] but by having more members
[1:03:35] it can be called more
[1:03:39] because there's more members right
[1:03:42] all right
[1:03:43] simply the plan of salvation
[1:03:47] simply speaking of
[1:03:50] how that god would start
[1:03:53] the man
[1:03:55] in the place
[1:03:58] and of course we want to get a we want
[1:04:00] to get a big story in our mind you know
[1:04:03] we like that don't we we like to read
[1:04:05] love story magazines
[1:04:08] and fantasize
[1:04:10] yeah
[1:04:12] i ain't talking about me i'm talking
[1:04:13] about people
[1:04:19] fantasize in your mind
[1:04:27] we try to figure it all out
[1:04:30] when the best thing to do is why not
[1:04:31] just accept it
[1:04:35] you can't figure out eternal life
[1:04:37] why don't you just accept it and let god
[1:04:40] take care of the rest of it
[1:04:43] you know
[1:04:44] why not just let him take care of all of
[1:04:46] it
[1:04:47] and reveal it
[1:04:49] you know what in all the studying you've
[1:04:51] ever done has never revealed anything to
[1:04:53] you
[1:04:55] or either the prophet missed it when he
[1:04:56] said the holy ghost is the only revealer
[1:04:58] of the word now if you don't read the
[1:05:00] word he can't reveal it to you because
[1:05:02] he can't open your head and pour it in
[1:05:07] faith comes by hearing and what hearing
[1:05:09] by the word and the word came by the
[1:05:11] prophet
[1:05:14] so that's why we ought to hear what the
[1:05:16] prophet has to say in the days of the
[1:05:18] voice of the seventh angel
[1:05:20] and depend upon what he said about it
[1:05:24] and what amazes me so much is the things
[1:05:26] maybe you don't never think about but
[1:05:28] you watch these notes that i bring you
[1:05:30] sometimes that i'll have five six pages
[1:05:32] of quotes and things from brother
[1:05:34] branham from 47
[1:05:37] to 65.
[1:05:40] and he's still saying the same thing
[1:05:45] well i can show you where he was wrong
[1:05:48] come on
[1:05:52] it's on internet
[1:05:54] don't be silly now
[1:05:56] don't come up with 700 instead of 7 000.
[1:06:03] don't come up with a white horse rider
[1:06:05] the way he taught it before because you
[1:06:07] didn't know nothing about the white
[1:06:08] horse rider and i didn't either until he
[1:06:10] came to tell us
[1:06:11] right and god and the man wasn't
[1:06:13] responsible until god opened the
[1:06:16] seals then he could teach the white
[1:06:18] horse riders the holy ghost
[1:06:23] and there was nobody to be able to
[1:06:25] correct him
[1:06:29] remember a prophet
[1:06:32] correction comes from god
[1:06:35] right
[1:06:37] okay
[1:06:38] so this man adam now
[1:06:41] or this man that we talk about
[1:06:46] would be one man but that man would have
[1:06:48] multiple forms
[1:06:55] i'll tell you what i believe
[1:06:57] i believe that man of genesis 1 26 and
[1:06:59] 27 was the christ
[1:07:02] and that one day
[1:07:05] he would come on the earth
[1:07:07] as a human mortal
[1:07:10] and he would give his life
[1:07:16] and that would start what he wanted in
[1:07:18] the garden
[1:07:20] for 4 000 years of man's time
[1:07:24] he never got what he wanted
[1:07:29] for 4 000 years of the old testament
[1:07:32] people he never got what he wanted
[1:07:36] the best he could do was get a few good
[1:07:38] people
[1:07:40] and most of them had plenty of flaws
[1:07:44] right
[1:07:46] what we're talking about last night when
[1:07:48] we talk about law and things
[1:07:50] then we only make the law always be in
[1:07:51] the ten commandments
[1:07:56] that's not what paul's talking about in
[1:07:57] romans when he talks about the law this
[1:08:00] and the commandments came
[1:08:03] because he said when the commandments
[1:08:04] came sin revived and i died
[1:08:08] what's paul talking about
[1:08:10] when the commandments came sin revived
[1:08:12] and i died
[1:08:17] have you ever got into that maybe some
[1:08:18] of you ought to go back and listen to
[1:08:20] what was said maybe or to play last
[1:08:22] night's message to the entire church
[1:08:27] because i enjoyed it
[1:08:31] all right
[1:08:34] because we saw what paul was talking
[1:08:36] about
[1:08:36] right then when the commandments came
[1:08:39] sin revived and i died
[1:08:42] the law didn't kill paul
[1:08:45] paul thought he was keeping the lord he
[1:08:47] was to the letter
[1:08:49] the law didn't kill him
[1:08:51] right
[1:08:53] but when christ came
[1:08:57] on that road to damascus when he was
[1:08:59] struck down
[1:09:02] right there paul became a sinner
[1:09:07] the man that had never done what he had
[1:09:09] never broke the laws right
[1:09:12] because that's what he said
[1:09:15] concerning the law blameless
[1:09:17] you argue with him
[1:09:20] the high priest couldn't have one mark
[1:09:21] against him or he'd be killed right
[1:09:24] paul wasn't a high priest but he was
[1:09:26] studying to be a um
[1:09:28] brother ryan said something about he's
[1:09:29] either studying to be a lawyer or being
[1:09:31] could be a high priest
[1:09:33] you know
[1:09:37] we see paul was looking at it when when
[1:09:39] that struck him down and brought around
[1:09:41] said that that pro man would not have
[1:09:44] called that any other thing
[1:09:47] then the great elohim
[1:09:49] almighty god
[1:09:51] they've struck him down
[1:09:53] and see his surprise was is when he said
[1:09:56] who are you and he said i'm jesus
[1:09:59] whom thou persecuted there's no record
[1:10:01] paul ever persecuted jesus he was there
[1:10:04] he knew about him probably done
[1:10:05] arguments about him and thing but he
[1:10:07] never done any damage until he come over
[1:10:08] with stephen and started with the doings
[1:10:10] of the killing of the church
[1:10:15] paul knew right then
[1:10:17] that all the law he had kept
[1:10:20] was just a school master
[1:10:23] right
[1:10:24] and could not bring life
[1:10:26] the law never brought life to no one
[1:10:32] you could keep it to the letter
[1:10:34] you can keep this message to the letter
[1:10:38] and still die and go to hell
[1:10:42] make a good person
[1:10:44] make a good neighbor
[1:10:47] right
[1:10:49] all right get off
[1:10:51] but do you understand that what i'm
[1:10:53] trying to drive at this man
[1:10:57] that come into being there in genesis 1
[1:10:59] 26 and 27
[1:11:02] would be
[1:11:07] all mankind that would ever receive
[1:11:10] eternal life
[1:11:21] because adam came right
[1:11:24] amen right
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:29] but everybody after the end didn't come
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:32] right
[1:11:34] we're giving them things
[1:11:36] then when jesus came he was the
[1:11:38] commandment he was the law he was the
[1:11:40] whole thing
[1:11:42] and he was that man
[1:11:46] that was doing why did brother branham
[1:11:48] make this statement about he said the
[1:11:50] only way he could be father was to be
[1:11:52] the son of man
[1:11:54] you remember that
[1:11:58] i'm glad to get you the quote i think
[1:11:59] it's the unveiling of god
[1:12:02] i'll find it for you
[1:12:04] the only way he could be the father he
[1:12:06] wanted to be
[1:12:07] would take place on the day of pentecost
[1:12:13] because nobody in that old testament
[1:12:15] except adam
[1:12:18] had eternal life
[1:12:22] he had to give it to adam to make it
[1:12:24] start right
[1:12:25] right
[1:12:27] all right
[1:12:29] so we'd realize who we are
[1:12:31] are you listening
[1:12:36] i want you to understand what i'm saying
[1:12:38] and then you make your mind up
[1:12:42] this man of 126 and 27 would
[1:12:45] be more than just to say the one man
[1:12:48] adam
[1:12:52] because remember eve was a part of it
[1:12:56] we got the quotes for it where she was
[1:12:58] still in theophany
[1:12:59] all right
[1:13:03] so it's not just a one
[1:13:05] man a one tall it's a one man in an
[1:13:08] example
[1:13:10] adam was the example son
[1:13:13] of the old testament
[1:13:16] jesus was
[1:13:18] the example son of the new testament
[1:13:23] right
[1:13:26] but you see this man here
[1:13:29] he is the soul of god
[1:13:37] there's only one soul that comes eternal
[1:13:45] you want to argue that point
[1:13:48] there's one soul that comes eternal
[1:13:50] that's the soul of god
[1:13:56] see then adam got a special impartation
[1:14:00] he got eternal life
[1:14:04] all right
[1:14:06] we're going to have to define something
[1:14:08] right now to word that you'll understand
[1:14:10] so listen
[1:14:15] so when adam was made
[1:14:21] his spiritual being was 126-27
[1:14:24] that would be put into 2 7.
[1:14:29] but a lot of people's thoughts would be
[1:14:31] about adam let's see if i can define it
[1:14:34] that adam was body and spirit
[1:14:40] adam and then he was given eternal life
[1:14:43] why does it stipulate
[1:14:45] that he breathed into the nostrils of
[1:14:47] adam
[1:14:50] and he became a living soul
[1:14:56] all right
[1:15:03] if you take the body and the spirit
[1:15:06] and call it adam and just put the
[1:15:08] eternal life in there to be separate
[1:15:10] from anything else because you see
[1:15:12] you're going to get tricky here for a
[1:15:13] few minutes so you better listen all
[1:15:15] right
[1:15:16] then you don't have adam you have god
[1:15:25] that's what i thought you've been trying
[1:15:26] to say
[1:15:28] no you got to bring the man adam into
[1:15:31] being right
[1:15:35] you got to bring the man adam into being
[1:15:42] and then you got to remember that eve is
[1:15:44] still part of that atom
[1:15:47] and she ain't brought into being there
[1:15:52] she's brought into being later
[1:15:58] what does it take to be a human being we
[1:16:00] had it this morning we didn't go through
[1:16:01] it but
[1:16:02] brother brown says you're a circle of a
[1:16:04] human being said you're a triune being
[1:16:05] just like god as father son and holy
[1:16:07] ghost
[1:16:08] and what did he say he said it's body
[1:16:10] spirit and soul
[1:16:12] that's what it takes to make a human
[1:16:13] being
[1:16:14] right
[1:16:16] body spirit soul makes a human being
[1:16:20] he said without either one of them i had
[1:16:22] a miss mourning to going to you but but
[1:16:24] you ought to know it but he said without
[1:16:25] either one of them you're not complete
[1:16:32] so you're not complete without body
[1:16:34] spirit and soul
[1:16:36] all right
[1:16:39] you can't just have a body in the spirit
[1:16:42] and be a human being
[1:16:44] i'd make you no different in the animal
[1:16:45] we're going to read that in a minute
[1:16:47] that's right
[1:16:48] all right
[1:16:50] because you just have a body and spirit
[1:16:51] of creation you'd be that but it takes
[1:16:54] body spirit and soul
[1:16:56] you see why the prophet would spend so
[1:16:58] much time explaining that
[1:17:01] and explaining what happens to each
[1:17:03] realm and what's going on
[1:17:08] and see then in his early ministry he
[1:17:10] would be explaining
[1:17:12] body
[1:17:13] soul
[1:17:14] spirit
[1:17:18] and beholding that as a way of
[1:17:20] describing it
[1:17:23] placing the spirit as the center rim
[1:17:29] and then from somewhere around close to
[1:17:32] the greatest battle ever fought in 62
[1:17:35] from there on
[1:17:37] he starts describing it as body
[1:17:40] spirit and soul
[1:17:45] well i'd like to know where he corrected
[1:17:47] that
[1:17:51] i'd like for you to show me where he
[1:17:52] corrected it
[1:18:01] if he didn't correct it then
[1:18:04] i don't think you and i have the ability
[1:18:08] to correct it
[1:18:09] right
[1:18:11] but if he was right all the time
[1:18:15] he didn't need to correct it
[1:18:19] he just his wordings was a little
[1:18:21] different
[1:18:23] because i've challenged you to find it
[1:18:25] and see
[1:18:27] he always gave
[1:18:29] outer rim see taste filled smell in here
[1:18:35] body he always gave the second rim of
[1:18:38] mankind whether he called it soul or
[1:18:40] whether he called it spirit
[1:18:42] he always gave the second realm of man
[1:18:45] memory reason conscious affection etc
[1:18:49] he always gave the center realm of man
[1:18:52] whether he called it bod a soul or
[1:18:55] called it spirit he gave it one sense
[1:18:59] faith or doubt
[1:19:01] so did he need to correct it
[1:19:05] i
[1:19:06] think that maybe that was withholding
[1:19:09] from him to were that mankind could use
[1:19:12] those things to try to
[1:19:14] trap the people with it because that's
[1:19:16] where the two soul people got their
[1:19:18] goings from
[1:19:24] but remember the bible says i give you a
[1:19:26] new heart
[1:19:27] and a new spirit
[1:19:28] right
[1:19:31] remember the bible speaks of the soul as
[1:19:34] being
[1:19:35] the real you that will go on after death
[1:19:40] and be
[1:19:42] either given eternal life or annihilated
[1:19:44] one day but god himself
[1:19:48] so did the prophet have to explain it
[1:19:52] no
[1:19:55] if you ain't got enough sense
[1:19:58] to realize that you make three circles
[1:20:01] and you give three circles and you give
[1:20:04] each one of them a nature or point or
[1:20:07] being
[1:20:08] and it don't matter what you call them
[1:20:10] it's still the same three circles
[1:20:16] i put that out in a minister's meeting
[1:20:18] years ago
[1:20:20] and they just went haywire
[1:20:22] yeah but he said but he said
[1:20:25] okay
[1:20:26] you explain it
[1:20:28] you're going to make him contradictory
[1:20:30] one to the other
[1:20:31] and i'm not making him contradictory i'm
[1:20:33] making him to where he's saying the same
[1:20:35] thing
[1:20:39] outer rim five senses see takes field
[1:20:42] smelling here
[1:20:43] second rim memory reason conscious
[1:20:45] affections loving you don't even love
[1:20:47] with your body you don't love with your
[1:20:49] soul you love with your spirit
[1:20:51] that's why you can be anointed on your
[1:20:53] spirit every day of your life and die
[1:20:56] and go to hell
[1:20:57] right
[1:21:03] but what if you took the old testament
[1:21:06] i mean the old form of what he would be
[1:21:08] using and putting the spirit as the
[1:21:11] center rim and then he would say you can
[1:21:13] have the anointing on your spirit
[1:21:19] you'd be in trouble
[1:21:21] you can't do that
[1:21:23] just
[1:21:25] like to lay out a few things
[1:21:27] a tron being
[1:21:31] to what was adam
[1:21:38] was he simply just
[1:21:40] a lifeless body
[1:21:42] standing there
[1:21:44] it's all right whatever you want to do
[1:21:47] you know when god created the body of
[1:21:49] genesis 2 7 was it just a lifeless form
[1:21:57] and then all at once he gave him
[1:22:00] eternal life and breathed into his
[1:22:01] nostrils and he become a living soul and
[1:22:03] automatic right then he gave him a soul
[1:22:06] that wouldn't be adam
[1:22:10] that'd be the same thing jesus was
[1:22:15] all right
[1:22:18] so what about this man
[1:22:23] brother brown said he put
[1:22:25] the genesis
[1:22:26] 1 26 and 27
[1:22:28] into this 2 7 man
[1:22:32] he said it's not two people
[1:22:34] it's the same man
[1:22:36] he said he just put him into that
[1:22:41] but you say well well all right okay
[1:22:43] let's read then
[1:22:46] go ahead brothers and start
[1:22:48] uh
[1:22:51] on number 11.
[1:22:54] that number 10 is the one where he
[1:22:56] explains about the the uh
[1:22:58] what the body spirit and soul and what
[1:23:00] we are
[1:23:03] so look what he's saying here on
[1:23:04] blasphemous names we start in the
[1:23:06] paragraph 184 and we'll read about just
[1:23:08] leave it up leave it down to that 184
[1:23:10] we're going to start our whole thing
[1:23:13] now here's jehovah witness
[1:23:16] in their book
[1:23:18] it says that the breath that you breathe
[1:23:20] is the soul
[1:23:21] now that cannot be right
[1:23:23] the breath that you breathe is not soul
[1:23:27] if it is you're you're one time you're
[1:23:29] one kind of a soul next time time you're
[1:23:32] somebody else has breathed that soul you
[1:23:35] know the the breath the going out that
[1:23:38] they talk about
[1:23:39] look where you'd be
[1:23:41] now the breath is the wind and the wind
[1:23:43] is what you breathe into your nostrils
[1:23:46] now they take the scripture from and god
[1:23:48] breathed breath
[1:23:50] into his nostrils and he became a living
[1:23:53] soul
[1:23:54] now i want to ask you something
[1:23:55] if he was a man what kind of a breath
[1:23:58] was he breathing before god breathed his
[1:24:00] breath of life into him two points that
[1:24:02] you can consider in this what kind of a
[1:24:04] breath
[1:24:05] was he a breathing living man
[1:24:08] well
[1:24:09] to take one side of it to say if that be
[1:24:11] so
[1:24:12] then every animal is a living soul
[1:24:19] if it's just a breath
[1:24:22] there'll be something a little different
[1:24:23] going on
[1:24:25] because they breathe a human soul and
[1:24:27] our soul and all together then jesus
[1:24:29] wouldn't have had to die the animal
[1:24:31] sacrifice would have been sufficiency oh
[1:24:34] brother the argument don't stand
[1:24:36] but what god did he breathed the breath
[1:24:39] of eternal life amen
[1:24:42] then he become a living soul
[1:24:45] a soul that can't die
[1:24:47] now watch now we're going to get into
[1:24:49] honey plum to our elbows notice breathe
[1:24:51] the breath of eternal life into his
[1:24:53] nostrils and he became an eternal
[1:24:56] soul because god breathed now once
[1:25:01] not what nature done
[1:25:03] but what god did he breathed the breath
[1:25:06] of life into his nostrils and he became
[1:25:08] a living soul
[1:25:09] then you say to me
[1:25:11] adam died brother branham but remember
[1:25:13] before adam died he had a lamb that
[1:25:15] redeemed him hallelujah
[1:25:17] those who he foreknew he has called
[1:25:20] he got a lamb to redeem them he was a
[1:25:22] type
[1:25:23] adam failed then the lamb was provided
[1:25:25] for adam because already in his nostrils
[1:25:28] had come become the breath of
[1:25:32] the eternal god
[1:25:34] and he became a living soul
[1:25:37] he was the son of god
[1:25:39] now this breath is a african word you
[1:25:42] know the greek words and the different
[1:25:44] things these sinners breathe the more
[1:25:46] you bring it on up
[1:25:48] then why would we struggle for eternal
[1:25:50] life if that's the eternal soul buried
[1:25:53] into us by breath
[1:25:54] why would we struggle for eternal life
[1:25:56] it backfires brother
[1:25:59] it just can't do it
[1:26:00] but god especially
[1:26:03] upon adam
[1:26:05] breathed the breath of eternal life
[1:26:08] and he became an eternal person with god
[1:26:14] he had power like god he was an amateur
[1:26:16] god he was god of the earth not god of
[1:26:18] heaven no god of the earth and someday
[1:26:21] the sons of god will
[1:26:22] again become gods
[1:26:25] all right
[1:26:27] so now into adam
[1:26:31] he breathed
[1:26:33] eternal life
[1:26:37] now when we are born as children god has
[1:26:40] to breathe into our nostrils life for us
[1:26:43] to live
[1:26:45] but he doesn't breathe eternal life
[1:26:50] and if he breed it into you and wouldn't
[1:26:52] breathe it into me then he's a respecter
[1:26:54] of persons and we lost that thought
[1:27:01] so then there was no one past adam to
[1:27:03] christ
[1:27:05] that could talk about eternal life
[1:27:10] now you've got to bring eve in there and
[1:27:11] we'll bring her into the next message
[1:27:13] all right
[1:27:15] and i believe she had eternal life
[1:27:18] all right there's no quote that says she
[1:27:20] had it because i've run the message
[1:27:23] you know
[1:27:24] but we'll get to the point of trying to
[1:27:26] understand
[1:27:28] if she was a part of adam and theophany
[1:27:30] then
[1:27:32] that's the part
[1:27:34] but get
[1:27:35] get one thing
[1:27:39] something special had to happen to this
[1:27:41] man
[1:27:42] that when he was turned around and
[1:27:43] called adam
[1:27:46] because
[1:27:49] god gave him eternal life
[1:27:53] now that's
[1:27:54] your prophet you argue with him
[1:27:57] i can just see them old things are
[1:27:58] clicking you can't have eternal life to
[1:28:01] calvary
[1:28:04] you've got to be borned again
[1:28:08] yeah that's all right go ahead
[1:28:12] but you're not in back in what the
[1:28:14] prophet had to say about it and none
[1:28:16] whatsoever and i'm glad he said it
[1:28:18] because we didn't know it right right
[1:28:21] we didn't know adam had eternal life
[1:28:23] right
[1:28:26] we just know he became a living soul
[1:28:32] you see the prophet could read between
[1:28:34] the lines
[1:28:36] and see that adam
[1:28:38] started out with eternal life
[1:28:41] but i want to ask you a simple question
[1:28:43] is a thought
[1:28:46] was adam body and spirit
[1:28:49] and then
[1:28:50] no soul whatsoever
[1:28:57] that wouldn't be adam
[1:29:00] that would be christ
[1:29:05] but if adam body and spirit
[1:29:09] was made a man standing there
[1:29:14] and he was
[1:29:16] a soul
[1:29:18] a being a person
[1:29:20] and then god put eternal life into adam
[1:29:25] then it would be adam
[1:29:29] now we'll cover this point this is a
[1:29:31] thought
[1:29:32] see then eve was still in theophany
[1:29:36] then when eve was made was she just made
[1:29:38] a body and a spirit
[1:29:43] she had to have a soul
[1:29:47] whatever you want to think she had to
[1:29:49] have a soul she had to get it some way
[1:29:51] some way adam got a soul or was a soul
[1:29:56] and then god could breathe into his
[1:29:57] nostrils eternal life
[1:30:00] same thing with eve
[1:30:04] because eve was still in theophany and
[1:30:06] had to be taken from that and put into
[1:30:08] flesh before that come into being
[1:30:11] and remember she never got her name eve
[1:30:14] no more than adam got a name as genesis
[1:30:17] 1 26
[1:30:19] he got a name when it comes into being
[1:30:21] about 2 7
[1:30:23] of the natural
[1:30:25] man
[1:30:28] eve never got her name
[1:30:30] until the fall
[1:30:32] because it would be wrong in the
[1:30:34] scripture
[1:30:35] because eve it says
[1:30:38] what does it say the definition of her
[1:30:40] name is
[1:30:42] the mother of all living
[1:30:46] so she brought forth the seed of the
[1:30:47] serpent
[1:30:48] and the seed of adam
[1:30:51] she's the mother of all living
[1:30:54] that's why i say there ain't no such
[1:30:55] thing in outer space
[1:30:58] you don't believe in extraoretrial
[1:31:00] beings no unbelieving
[1:31:02] and we're here
[1:31:03] if there's anybody out there in any way
[1:31:06] or any form he had to come from here
[1:31:08] well how do you know that because it
[1:31:10] said eve was the mother of all living
[1:31:12] okay soft no argument
[1:31:17] right
[1:31:19] i love it that way
[1:31:21] well that just makes you a smart aleck
[1:31:22] well no no it might make me a nellie but
[1:31:24] i ain't too smart because if i smart i'd
[1:31:26] quit preaching sit down and listen to
[1:31:28] somebody else i guess
[1:31:30] but think about it
[1:31:32] this man adam
[1:31:35] because that's the only way you can talk
[1:31:36] brother brandon could you know he
[1:31:38] couldn't come up and say now no name was
[1:31:40] the man that was in 126-27
[1:31:44] and then he was given a name adam and
[1:31:46] and so we'll deal with no name
[1:31:48] over here and adam over here
[1:31:53] he didn't do that he just talked about
[1:31:55] adam
[1:31:56] i can talk about adam but i know what
[1:31:58] happened to adam
[1:32:01] adam means the beginning our red man
[1:32:05] you know earthly
[1:32:08] he had to come into being as an earthly
[1:32:11] part to be called adam which was a
[1:32:14] genesis 2
[1:32:15] and 7 man
[1:32:18] he said do we need to understand this
[1:32:19] what is the new birth
[1:32:21] why do you need the new birth
[1:32:29] what do you need a new birth for if the
[1:32:31] breath of life in a baby's nostrils
[1:32:33] makes it eternal
[1:32:37] why did jesus christ have to die
[1:32:40] so we know that's not true
[1:32:46] and we know we didn't come the way god
[1:32:48] wanted us to come right
[1:32:50] we know that for sure
[1:32:52] that we didn't come the way god intended
[1:32:54] for it to be
[1:32:57] but he's going to use it
[1:32:59] his permissive will and make it his
[1:33:01] perfect
[1:33:03] and to do that it was necessary that he
[1:33:05] have to come
[1:33:07] and die
[1:33:11] now may i ask you a question as we read
[1:33:14] the quote this morning
[1:33:15] that brother brown said when he walked
[1:33:17] here on the shores of galilee
[1:33:19] paraphrasing it we walked in him
[1:33:23] right you you need those quotes is that
[1:33:26] everybody understand the prophets made
[1:33:28] that statement many times
[1:33:29] that when he was on the shores of
[1:33:31] galilee i was in when he went to hell i
[1:33:33] went with him
[1:33:34] when he went to the grave i went with
[1:33:35] him
[1:33:37] do i need to go pull those quotes
[1:33:39] because they can pull them in a hurry
[1:33:40] back there
[1:33:45] but listen
[1:33:48] how was i in christ
[1:33:56] it would have to be a part of his own
[1:33:58] life right
[1:33:59] not physically speaking i mean we didn't
[1:34:01] come here to have enough
[1:34:02] sense to not think about that we come
[1:34:05] here physically in him
[1:34:07] or any form like that
[1:34:13] but the eternal life i have today was in
[1:34:16] him when he walked the shores of galilee
[1:34:19] is that you
[1:34:20] so then that eternal life was the one
[1:34:22] that was put into adam that's right
[1:34:24] so that man was christ
[1:34:30] amen and that man one day came into
[1:34:32] human flesh
[1:34:34] and we called him jesus christ
[1:34:38] and that eternal life that we have today
[1:34:40] was in him
[1:34:42] when he was walking back there
[1:34:47] did brother around and say we was even
[1:34:49] in his side
[1:34:50] does that mean we were physically in
[1:34:52] there you know
[1:34:53] and he had to put a spear in there and
[1:34:55] let the blood run out and when it did we
[1:34:57] all flopped out
[1:34:59] don't be stupid
[1:35:06] right
[1:35:08] we were in him as part of his life
[1:35:13] this man adam
[1:35:16] had a part of his life
[1:35:21] and he was made eternal
[1:35:24] but nobody else from there on down until
[1:35:26] christ could say that
[1:35:30] it could speak in prophecies as thy soul
[1:35:32] liveth
[1:35:34] brother branham will even say see there
[1:35:35] are elijah they were talking about that
[1:35:38] even his soul liveth that it was eternal
[1:35:40] he's not giving him eternal life back
[1:35:42] there
[1:35:47] no
[1:35:49] because from that on it had to wait to
[1:35:51] calvary
[1:35:56] and that would be christ
[1:36:00] brother uh
[1:36:02] henry greene used to quote brother
[1:36:03] branham
[1:36:06] he said brother branham said one day
[1:36:08] that god started his church the way he
[1:36:11] wanted it
[1:36:13] he said and he said
[1:36:15] he wants his church the way he started
[1:36:18] it
[1:36:19] now that's a good statement
[1:36:22] he started the church the way he wanted
[1:36:24] it he wants the church the way he
[1:36:26] started it
[1:36:27] he started in adam as an example son of
[1:36:31] the god of earth
[1:36:34] and we lost all of that rulership
[1:36:36] but even in our fallen estate we still
[1:36:39] have the abilities and the cree the
[1:36:40] parts to to put together to do things
[1:36:43] and and even the animals that said well
[1:36:45] ago are still scared of us
[1:36:48] right
[1:36:49] in their abilities we've been able to
[1:36:51] time every animal that's ever been in
[1:36:52] the world
[1:36:58] right
[1:37:01] he said well what about a big old
[1:37:02] grizzly you take a grizzly bear it's a
[1:37:04] little bitty cub
[1:37:06] and you raise it right and it's it ain't
[1:37:08] no big old big grizzlies
[1:37:11] you take the one up in
[1:37:13] alaska the big old white one
[1:37:16] that when you land there you're on the
[1:37:19] chain of command of food
[1:37:22] he's looking for something to eat
[1:37:24] and you're on that line
[1:37:26] if you get in the way
[1:37:28] but you take him as a baby and train him
[1:37:30] and he's a little bitty pet
[1:37:36] my nephew the other day was looking at
[1:37:38] some cows over terrence come on brother
[1:37:41] we're at terrance the other day and then
[1:37:42] little cows were standing up there and
[1:37:44] that old barbed wire fence was high
[1:37:46] pulled a fart you know and everything
[1:37:48] he's just tuckered down all that he said
[1:37:50] if them cows had any sense they could
[1:37:52] walk through that wire that's right
[1:37:57] that's life
[1:37:58] that's true
[1:37:59] if they could figure it out they'd just
[1:38:01] stick their head in there and keep going
[1:38:03] well you know what some of them does
[1:38:04] that and then you might as well put your
[1:38:06] yoke around his neck or shoot it because
[1:38:08] it ain't gonna stay in the pasture no
[1:38:10] more
[1:38:11] because he's gonna learn about being
[1:38:12] able to get out right
[1:38:14] because we're nothing and we're just a
[1:38:16] bigger animal
[1:38:20] but we are the one that god gave his
[1:38:21] life for
[1:38:24] he never gave it
[1:38:26] for huma for just animals he gave it for
[1:38:28] you man mankind let's stand together
[1:38:30] what do we got
[1:38:36] anybody have a need let's stand together
[1:38:51] i hope you go home and think about it
[1:38:55] what is that man talking about
[1:38:57] i'm talking about that there was a man
[1:38:59] in the garden created
[1:39:02] and that man was breathing his nostrils
[1:39:05] and he became an eternal person with god
[1:39:09] and that that's what god wants now out
[1:39:11] of you and i
[1:39:12] he became a manifested son of god
[1:39:16] that could name the animals that could
[1:39:18] lead them could rule them
[1:39:20] without
[1:39:21] harmful rulings
[1:39:24] he could rule them with love
[1:39:26] and the prophet said that's what god
[1:39:28] wants out of his children
[1:39:33] the manifestation of sons and daughters
[1:39:36] come back to realize who they are and
[1:39:38] what they're doing and what we're here
[1:39:39] for
[1:39:41] now ain't no need to worry about it
[1:39:44] it's not that away we'd walk out and i
[1:39:46] remember a man telling it years ago and
[1:39:48] how many of us has done it but he went
[1:39:50] up to this hornet's nest and he said i
[1:39:52] command you
[1:39:54] and they commanded him all right
[1:39:58] it wasn't long until he was leaving out
[1:40:00] of there
[1:40:02] and one man said he had these yellow
[1:40:04] jackets come up on the tree
[1:40:07] and said he said i command you little
[1:40:09] yellowjacket to get out of here and he
[1:40:11] said he got it right on the end of the
[1:40:12] nose
[1:40:16] all right that don't work that away
[1:40:20] that ain't even safe common sense to
[1:40:21] start screaming and hollering because
[1:40:23] the animal knows better
[1:40:25] but if you'll love the animal
[1:40:30] you might find out
[1:40:32] love can conquer
[1:40:37] well brother tatum was down at brother
[1:40:39] hollins one day
[1:40:40] he had a german shepherd that that
[1:40:41] suckered bit of tire on my car and had
[1:40:43] to pull it off
[1:40:44] because his teeth were so tough
[1:40:48] and that old dog was up in the back of
[1:40:50] the truck
[1:40:52] brother tatum hadn't been down there to
[1:40:53] see the dog or nothing
[1:40:56] we was going down to see brother holland
[1:40:57] and him and
[1:40:58] i told peggy and them brother tatum
[1:41:00] didn't hear me i said that dog's
[1:41:02] is rough i said because we parked there
[1:41:04] and rode to work i said y'all get behind
[1:41:07] me if the dog jumps i'll try my best to
[1:41:09] take care of the dog because we had to
[1:41:11] walk pretty close to the back end of the
[1:41:12] truck
[1:41:14] and old brother tatum come up before i
[1:41:15] could say anything old brother tatum
[1:41:17] brought past right by me and he walked
[1:41:19] up there and he that old dog was just
[1:41:23] you know
[1:41:24] he walked up there and he stuck his hand
[1:41:26] he said now blackie what's wrong with
[1:41:27] you
[1:41:30] that old dog just laid down in the back
[1:41:32] of the truck
[1:41:37] i mean just
[1:41:38] he had love in his heart for that animal
[1:41:41] that animal knew it
[1:41:43] go ahead brother number eight in the
[1:41:45] spiral book

[1:42:50] taped it
[1:42:51] daddy's got one under his watch right
[1:42:54] now when
[1:43:08] you
[1:43:17] we send this in the name of jesus christ

[1:46:22] the one to be

[1:46:42] that if it stays out of rhythm and
[1:46:43] things said blood will form in the body
[1:46:46] because it does not pump in the top part
[1:46:48] strong enough to remove all of the blood
[1:46:51] and said it'll remain in there and said
[1:46:52] it formed in the clots and said it'll go
[1:46:54] to your brain
[1:46:58] brother dale was you scared when he said
[1:47:00] that

[1:50:20] here in a minute to go home
[1:50:24] we've seen god heal
[1:50:27] we've seen god deliver
[1:50:29] when you see a man and his eyes rolls
[1:50:31] totally back in his head and he stops
[1:50:32] breathing
[1:50:34] and you call his name after he's been
[1:50:36] laying there a while and you call his
[1:50:38] name and he raises up and he says
[1:50:41] sam
[1:50:47] when you see those things take place

[1:51:03] you know
[1:51:05] when something's wrong with you i'm i'm
[1:51:07] afraid
[1:51:09] but to me
[1:51:12] death is not my victor
[1:51:16] i'm it's conqueror
[1:51:20] and i've proved it to you over the years
[1:51:21] and years that i've stood here with you
[1:51:24] and you've seen god come on the scene
[1:51:26] and deliver
[1:51:31] i say but
[1:51:32] brother dale if we just we just had this
[1:51:34] out of the other why not accept what we
[1:51:36] got
[1:51:38] you know what
[1:51:41] that's what i asked that doctor when he
[1:51:42] was talking to me about how do you feel
[1:51:44] with your heart out of rhythm i said how
[1:51:47] am i supposed to feel i'm 74 years old

[1:52:08] whole day just come on we'll
[1:52:10] we'll see who lasts the longest
[1:52:16] why
[1:52:17] because i'm not afraid
[1:52:19] went down to deer hunting land the other
[1:52:21] day
[1:52:22] richard he wants to be the smartest and
[1:52:24] help pop out yeah
[1:52:26] he tried to climb up every tree but i
[1:52:27] beat him too some of them climbed them
[1:52:29] trees and took stand loose
[1:52:34] right
[1:52:36] because i ain't give up
[1:52:39] when i get give out then i'll think
[1:52:41] about giving up
[1:52:43] but until then i ain't gonna worry about
[1:52:44] it all right sorry about that just
[1:52:46] remember pray one for another just keep
[1:52:49] waiting in your mind as he's traveling
[1:52:50] and the lord is really seemingly must be
[1:52:52] blessing a lot if they had 600 brother
[1:52:54] danny's church i know i've been there
[1:52:57] unless he's got a new church they will
[1:52:59] stand in room only upstairs and
[1:53:01] downstairs if they had 600 in that
[1:53:03] building
[1:53:05] and this the lord will
[1:53:08] take care of everything
[1:53:10] and give us what we have need of right
[1:53:13] i believe that
[1:53:15] put what you got up on your own faith
[1:53:20] put it on your own faith
[1:53:23] say lord
[1:53:25] you know i believe
[1:53:28] i believe the prophet's message
[1:53:31] and
[1:53:32] you healed people before
[1:53:35] they never even heard of a prophet
[1:53:38] and i put it on his word
[1:53:40] and i believe it
[1:53:43] you know it might surprise you
[1:53:45] what's this like was listening the other
[1:53:47] night where brother brown said you
[1:53:48] prayed for
[1:53:50] he said you don't immediately get well
[1:53:53] when i didn't get it
[1:53:55] he said it might be three months later
[1:53:58] he was telling about the two ladies that
[1:54:00] brother branham had told one of them i
[1:54:01] know thus saith the lord
[1:54:04] about her
[1:54:06] one of them had a quarter and one of
[1:54:07] them had
[1:54:08] ulcers
[1:54:09] one of those two he told him it's not
[1:54:11] saith the lord might have told both of
[1:54:12] them now i'm just saying the best i can
[1:54:13] remember
[1:54:15] and you know it was months later and
[1:54:16] that lady was standing there and
[1:54:19] her husband even said honey said i agree
[1:54:22] with you but said you're making a little
[1:54:23] mockery out of
[1:54:25] of this about that you're healed
[1:54:28] said she's turned around to him and said
[1:54:31] husband said
[1:54:32] that man called me out and told me my
[1:54:35] life and the things that i'd done and
[1:54:37] all about me and said then he turned
[1:54:39] around and says you're healed and said i
[1:54:41] have no right to doubt what he said
[1:54:44] i'm healed
[1:54:47] her husband went to work
[1:54:50] said she looked said the kids had left
[1:54:52] some toast and she said
[1:54:54] i know i hate it
[1:54:56] but said i'll
[1:54:58] i'll eat it
[1:54:59] she ate a little piece of toast
[1:55:01] didn't bother her
[1:55:03] they left some oatmeal and he said
[1:55:05] that's one thing you don't eat with a
[1:55:06] bad stomach
[1:55:08] he said she ate the oatmeal
[1:55:10] said sit around there a little while and
[1:55:13] thought
[1:55:14] got up fried her some eggs and bacon and
[1:55:16] stuff and said just had a jubilee eaten
[1:55:20] well then she decided to go down and
[1:55:21] tell the neighbor that was the other
[1:55:23] lady in the story
[1:55:25] about what had happened since she got
[1:55:26] down nearly to that house and
[1:55:28] said she heard some screaming and
[1:55:30] hollering she thought the lady had died
[1:55:32] or somebody had broke in or something
[1:55:33] you know
[1:55:34] and said she goes in the house and said
[1:55:36] the lady's shaking the sheet in the
[1:55:37] bedroom
[1:55:40] said what are you doing
[1:55:43] she said i went to sleep last night with
[1:55:46] a border
[1:55:47] on my
[1:55:48] face or somewhere on her neck and said
[1:55:50] when i woke up this morning it's gone
[1:55:52] i'm trying to find it
[1:55:56] she turned around and told her her story
[1:55:59] of how this is delivered
[1:56:02] well see it may take three months but
[1:56:03] now let's don't prop it up by saying
[1:56:05] well you know it may take three months
[1:56:07] for this now
[1:56:08] let's believe
[1:56:10] and say thank you lord
[1:56:13] thank you lord
[1:56:15] but you never have thought
[1:56:18] i know what i would not say i guess

[1:56:35] cleans her own house
[1:56:37] works in the yard

[1:56:44] let alone anything else
[1:56:47] brother how he's just a tad over 60.
[1:56:55] but i will tell you some things that's
[1:56:57] happened with brother howell sometimes
[1:56:58] if you want to sit down
[1:57:00] where he had some problems one time and
[1:57:02] he came up here and he said
[1:57:04] i believe the prophet
[1:57:06] i was there in his ministry
[1:57:09] but he said i believe that same god is
[1:57:12] still alive
[1:57:13] in your ministry
[1:57:16] and he said
[1:57:18] i'm going to put my healing on that and
[1:57:20] he was delivered

[1:57:51] been able to
[1:57:52] use a little church to be able to call
