========================================

[Music] four rounds your power and [Music] good to be in the house of the Lord with you my wife couldn't be here tonight because they turned the gas off and she had to wait till they turned it back on and everything I think it's gonna be 27 degrees night so I'm gonna make sure we had some heat so it's good to see y'all Luise family good to see y'all amen let's turn over into Hebrews chapter 7 and I'm gonna read from first Timothy chapter 6 and while they're getting that up let's just go to the Lord in prayer well God was so grateful to you to be able to gather together and bring our little licks of fire together once again Lord Jesus we so grateful for the word that we've heard that in this day you know Jesus not pray God that the things that will be said tonight will be edified and a blessing to your people and Laurel that you'll let me just treat your little lady right God that something said well might be helpful to deliver and to to give us courage and faith to overcome a little bit more in this our Lord Jesus granite Lord Jesus you'll just feel welcome here tonight Lord God as we open the doors of our hearts Lord that you'll come and take up your abode with us Lord Jesus and and Lord quicken the word to us Lord Jesus quicken the word in my lips and then they hears ears or Jesus and that you'll just make this service tonight not just another gathering Lord but something special or that when we leave this place Lord that the the words that we've heard will echo in our hearts and it calls us Lord Jesus too long for the closer walk with you we pray we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Hebrews chapter 7 verse 1 verse 1 to the three didn't bring any glasses with me and it says for this Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the Most High God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a 10 part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made unlike under the Son of God and by the priest continually and then first Timothy chapter six and instead of reading from revelation I'm gonna read from here because Paul's saying some things that that are are really good for this little message I believe so it's verse 13 he says I give thee charge he's talking to he's building up Timothy a little bit he's telling me how he should do and everything he says I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spot unruhe buell until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he shall show and I got that highlighted for a reason which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and holy potentate the king of kings and Lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom the honor and power everlasting amen you may be seated the Lord is a blessing to the reading the word so as you might have noticed I'm gonna read some things about who is no kissing it but I want to title this with this message tonight now who is no kissing it but who is this King of Kings because I believe that that one of the things brother Branham showed us through this message is that as as God unfolds himself he reveals you are revealed along with Jesus Christ and there's some things that that happen through his unfolding I want you to pay attention now that to the things that that we just read there's there's three titles that were applied to this man who this man Melchizedek king of kings king of Salem which is P I'm sorry I missed that back the king of righteousness king of righteousness king of Salem and King of Kings see if you've got these three titles that are applied to this man to help us to understand who exactly this is that that that Abraham met with and that he slowed later on and then it's kind of talked about all down through scripture in a very mysterious way you know you know like a lot of the denominations they kind of probe and prod at who at this who would be this man what is the nature of this man milk is a dick and everything and you know that's something that really never really we never really could understand who Melchizedek was until brother branham the message came and this message was brought to allow us to peer into say the back part of God's mind and see what his great hidden mystery was and to see how it would unfold us so look at this look at this the king of righteousness it begins God begin is unfolding himself king of righteousness king of peace down to king of kings where he comes in authority he comes in manifest to himself in flesh and he has dominion because that's what the King does the King has Dominion he has authority he's not like a king today if he was a ruler of a house a ruler of a city or whatever it might be ruler of a kingdom if somebody were in that Kingdom that he wouldn't that he didn't want to be in that Kingdom he would come along and kick him out he wouldn't allow him to come in so you see that as God the condescends that he's descending what he's doing is he's conquering he's taking over he's booting the devil out of his kingdom that's what his purpose is that's what his plan is to is to overcome and so if you're a king if God makes you a king then he's made you an overcomer as well you see and so when when the word begins to unfold and reveal your place in your part in this mystery that you begin to see that you are an overcomer - and see it says in first Timothy it says which in his times he shall show which in his time as he shall show you know Abraham sitting there talking to Melchizedek as he he came after the defeat of the kings and he's sitting there across the table from him having communion and and you know God had given all of these promises about how all the land would be his and a lot of the things that that God promised Abraham my Abraham never really saw a Abraham didn't really see that all that he could walk through the land and look at it and he's God told him look to the left and the right and all this is yours but yet he had all of these battles and things and he would he would have fight for the whales and fight for the here everywhere he went he was constantly fighting but yet it was his children that he raised up on the admonition of the Lord that actually saw the land become his and then later on as the children of Israel crossed over Kadish Barnea and crossed into the promised land then the land was was finally theirs and they began to spread out but but they didn't Abraham didn't really see those things the things that God had promised him and you know you know the same thing could be said of the disciples where Jesus Jesus promised them he promised them speaking conditions he promised them to say to this mountain be moved but they never really came to that did they he promised it brung Paul promised the Thessalonians he promised them a rock she promised the Corinthians a body change he promised him things that they never never really saw but in the it went which in his times he shall show in the time that he is ready to reveal it to make it manifest that he'll unfold it and make it known and now is the time now is the time when we can look back to that king of righteousness we can look back and see what was written what was promised and we can lay claim to the things that are going to be made manifest in our libel Eve that people that are sitting here right now some of the people are going to be are going to be present when those promises were will be made manifest will be will be visible the body change the speaking conditions whatever you say say to this mountain whatever you ask when you pray whatever you speak speak it but to know but to be able to have access to those things you got to know where you came from and that's what the didn't that doesn't the scripture say that the Holy Ghost when he came he'll show you you know bring things to your remembrance and he'll show you things to come and so that's what the the Holy Spirit is showing us is take letting us Bax look back to the promises of God let us look back to the things that were written let us look into the mysterious things that were hidden through the generations and unfold the scroll and look in and say well it was written it was written of me in this day and you can look and see your life becoming a living reality of what was promised you can see the word being fulfilled in your life and in the lives of others you can see God unfolding his word to the church and that's what the king of righteousness is the king of righteousness what is righteousness neat mean rightness the king of righteousness was is rightness the pattern that everything has to adhere to everything has to match up with that pattern brother Brahim talked about how God that before the eternal was Ella helm was self-existing along with his attributes all of his attributes existed within him and he was the self existing God and a long waiting for those attributes to be made manifest the king of righteousness God along with his attributes you think about what what what what was in those attributes we know what an attribute is like a gene an attribute is like your DNA that says an attribute would be like your hair color or the way that you act the way that you know I can look at my children and see that they carry on might some of my genes and some of my wife's change some of the some of the things that that that the way my family acted they some of them have and there's some of the things that the way of my wife's family have and some of them are a little concoction and everything but we're talking about the genes of God and the genes of God are supposed to overtake the genes of man they supposed to is supposed to it's supposed to what I was talking about a king will boot out all the things that are not supposed to be there and if you've got a temper if you roll back when somebody says something to you if you can't stand ridicule then that that DNA it's got to overtake that somehow that king of righteousness DNA the king of righteousness where those genes in him he and all of these all of these attributes you know you know you know you wonder why I went there when he was offered taking communion with Melchizedek and it says there he paid tithes to Melchizedek and Levi who was not even born yet a long way from being born Isaac and Jacob were not even born yet but it was counted to Levi it was counted to Levi because Levi was in Abraham's genes Levi was in Abraham's genes what about you if you are in God's genes a gene waiting to be expressed part of that word waiting to come forth i'ma let me go ahead and jump ahead if if if you are part of God the things that happen to God the things that being a brother and preached about how you are identified with Christ you're identified with him when he walked on the shores of Galilee you were there with him when he died on the cross when he went to hell you were there with him because you're identified with him you were in him that attribute waiting to be expressed was inside of him so if you know where you come from if you know where you if you know your origin then you know what you've got when it gives you power to know what you've got to do in this age it gives you power to know that you are a living manifestation of God's Word if you take one of those little attributes of God and express it that's the father being expressed if you take if you take those attributes and show it out and express it the word is the as the father expressed and if you are the word living and walking and moving around on two feet then you are the father Express you think about what is king of righteousness king of righteousness is rightness the attributes the thoughts waiting to be expressed the attributes of Redeemer Savior counsellor Prince of Peace everlasting father mighty God all of those things in God waiting to be expressed waiting to the moment where he could be a redeemer sitting back waiting watching Adam try to be a redeemer and fail and then say well I it's part of me to be a redeemer and coming down and playing the part of that Redeemer killing the lamb and covering over Adam and Eve with that blood doing all of these things being a savior a counselor or the Prince of Peace that Prince of Salem the king of Salem the everlasting father but what else was in him waiting to be expressed we're all those of these attributes of a ministers ministers inside of him waiting to be expressed deacons sown leaders prayer warriors somebody that would get down on their knees and call upon God and still something happens homemakers a little people like brother around talk about carrying a lunch box we're the people that work we'll look at them and say that's a real Christian that's somebody that's manifesting the father they might not know who that male kids are their kids but that you nevertheless is being made manifest because they are the manifestation of the Living Word of God walking on two feet with not using their eyes using their hands speaking through their lips using their tongue God walking on two feet again you say well who is this milk is that I got home by the end of this sermon you'll know who is this milk isn't it gets got Christ in you the hope of glory revealed to get in flesh song leaders who worshipers the church filled again with the Holy Ghost power those are the attributes of God in the king of righteousness waiting to be fulfilled and when you see those attributes manifested then you're seeing the king of righteousness you're seeing God made manifest where did Abraham meet Melchizedek brother Branham talks about how Abraham was poor but yet he was spiritually rich he didn't have nothing of this world living in a tense being a nomad going from one to place partner from place to place and you know I often joke about how he goes message believers are kind of like nomads we're all constantly traveling going after that word people want brother branham priest you know people constantly on the road trying to get that word we're still nomads we're trying to try to feed our soul and he was looking why was he in no matter cuz he's looking for that New Jerusalem he's looking for the place where the king of Salem would reign do you think about the king of Salem Raylan reigning over that New Jerusalem the New Jerusalem typifies the bride a bride adorned with adorned for her husband coming down from God out of heaven that New Jerusalem is a city where it's made up of all of these people all of these people living there under the headship of their king sitting there and that's the that's the place that where Abraham was looking for and he he wandered from place to place and finally he met Melchizedek after the slaughter of the kings and you know brother Brown talked about how that that that Abraham went after a lot like a good backslidden a backslidden Christian he went out chasing after him and he and he fought that battle and he and he slaughtered the kings he slaughtered the kings and then brought a lot back to the place that he had left from and he restored to him all the things that he had lost and then he met Melchizedek because you can't milk it you can't meet Melchizedek until you've gone through a battle but you see his gods couldn't God a condescending he's coming down the king of king of righteousness king of Salem King Jesus all the way down and then he begins to go back up and the whole thing is a battle but Jesus on the cross was a battle the Abraham on the way to meet Melchizedek is a battle and you and I are in a battle we're fighting our way back in the fellowship with him you can't meet Melchizedek without a battle I think sometimes we want to have we want it we want things to go we want everything to go just perfectly smooth without any car accidents without any any problems in our life without any any things going going wrong but you know brother branham said the Bible teaches that suffering is what brings character you've got to have suffering suffering suffering in your life mold you into into a character where because you're pressurized on the inside you've got that power of the Holy Ghost on the inside pressing out you it mold you into the into somebody that trusts God and that leads upon here I'm not on your own understanding but you're leaning upon upon who Jesus is the king of righteousness and then he blessed them Abraham when he met mo kids that keep a Melchizedek blessed him that had been delivered of his enemies think about think about what that king of righteousness means in in that king of righteousness are all of your rights and privileges all of the rights and privileges of a believer and it's where you get your confidence from cuz you look back in God's Word and you say it says this it says this that somebody's got to fulfill it it might as well be me you know I believe it's about time we search out what our rights are you know Abraham when he was wandering around he was looking to see what his rights were as he went from place to place throughout the land this is mine and this is mine I own this I own this and one day the children of Israel they they came to Kadesh Barnea and they said spies into the land to search out what their rights were they went over in the case Barney and I set out searching out what their rights were to find out what the word said was theirs I'm talking about speaking conditions I'm talking about a rapture a body change I'm talking about things that were never seen by any of the early church they were never manifested to them but now it's time for that to be manifested and how is it going to be manifested at us unless we search it out and find out whether it belongs to us the only way we can find out whether it's ours or not is to get in dig into the message and dig into the tapes get to church and be a church when you're supposed to be and find out whether it belongs you you search out your rights and privileges you know when when the children of visual then when they finally got to the promised land in the book of Joshua talks about how they sent there was seven seven tribes that had not been given their inherit us yet and they wanted to know what's my inheritance they had come over worse what's my inheritance and so Joshua said go out through all the land go out and and and document where you all how everything at the rivers and the mountains and the streams and all the things the green grass documented in a wood in a seven part book and then bring it back to me and so they searched out the land and they went to find out what was their inheritance and they wrote it in a seven part book and now I believe it's the time when we can look into the seven part book and we can find out what's ours or not we can find out what our inheritance is it's time to look into the open book because it's open we're looking and we're not looking into just any normal book we're looking into the book of the king of righteousness we're looking into the book of the one that where your name was written before the foundation of the world how are you gonna know if your name's written there or not unless you go look in the book and find it you know they sing that song I wonder if John saw me I wonder if he saw me I think it's time but we don't wonder anymore I think it's time when we get into the book and find out for certain if he saw me over there why because it's time for us to get the mind of Christ and first Corinthians it says for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ the mighty were lost how astounding that is to be able to look into the mind of Christ not just the front part the but the back part the back part the thing that he wanted to unveil from before the foundation of the world the thing which is you and I God Christ in you the hope of glory and and you're sitting here now and being able to feast on the word and have the mind look into his mind and and fellowship with him and and oneness and unity let me calm down for a second recent quotes let's look at number one who is this milk is it a brother rap said now the true revelation of Melchizedek comes into view what he was God the word before he became flesh God the word cuz he had to be no one else could be immortal like him see I had father and mother you did to Jesus had father and mother but this man had no father no mother Jesus had a time he started this man didn't do you see what he said and there's a man there's a that man on the inside of Jesus that eternal theophany that never had a beginning one that was one day when when when that little that little germ cell began to develop on the inside of Mary and that had a beginning and then one day when he rose from the grave that body was glorified and it was called up to the Father and and then it had no beginning arena see I had father and mother you did - Jesus had father and mother but this man had no father had no mother Jesus had a time he started this man didn't Jesus gave his life this man couldn't because he was life and it's the self-same man all the time now there's a little mystery right there it's the self-same man all the time it was the self-same man before the foundation of the world it was the self-same man when he talked to milk wood when he talked to Abraham it was that self same man when he walked before Moses and he turned so he couldn't see his front face he could so only see his backside it was a self same man again when he walked on the shores of Galilee and now it's the self same man again veiled in his bride as yourself same man in the same man all the time it's the self same man all the time I hope God reveals it to you I believe I believe he's revealing it to us I believe we're getting something the self same person all the time notice his title king of righteousness now Hebrews 7 - king of right and king of peace he has two kings now watch Hebrews 72 king of righteousness also the king of peace he has two Kings there now since he has come in the flesh and received his body up and in Revelation 21 16 he is called the King of Kings he is all three of them together why is he called the King of Kings after he's received his body hook because now he could put his life he could L on the day of Pentecost he put his life inside of the believers and then they started that overcoming process they became overcomers he had already overcome what like we were just listening on that tape that was playing it before I come out he's already over cooking for us but you've got an overcoming work to do to because you got to believe him you've got to believe that he died and paid for your sins you got it you gotta believe that he paid the price you gotta trust in His redemptive work you gonna trust that he paid the whole price and you know that so it seems like it's so difficult for us we look around and we've got afflictions in our body we've got all these things happening we got turmoil that look around today and there's so many today have have problems in their minds and depression and all these things but I believe we need to look to you know you start getting in your mind that that you've had something so long that God's no longer able to deliver you that the devil has a right to stay there but the devil don't have a right because you could look back into that book of the king of righteousness does he have a right to stay there if you'll just believe he can get kicked out remember brother around hey the Bible talks about how after 38 years that little man at the Pool of Bethesda he was he was sitting there for 38 years and maybe he had got to the point where he thought I'm just supposed to stay like this but then Along Came Jesus Along Came that Melchizedek I remember the little woman that touched Jesus His garment she had been like that for 12 years and maybe she thought well it's too late it's too late for me in my body I've had this for so long I'm just gonna have to live with it but then Along Came Jesus and she reached out and touched His garment and you could touch Jesus's garment right here just hearing the word just by sitting there in your seat just like that castle Cornelius said when the word was spoken they're feeling their heart and they believed it then they were baptized with the Holy Ghost you don't have to you don't have to do all these things all you have to do is just sit there in your seat and hear the word and believe it and you can be delivered and healed and feel the Holy Ghost it's not by works but it's by grace the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that he saved us all where was I now since he has come in the flesh I say he is all three of them together seeking God king theophany King Jesus he is the king of kings it's all met just like soul body and spirit all comes to make one I see see how he put that in soul body spirit cuz look he's coming down and then he's going back up in you after he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost after he fills you with his life then you begin the overcoming process and you think it'll be easy and everything but God's working his way out as you let him as you open up the door as you open up the door to the world and you allow him to have complete preeminence at you and as you allow him to have kingship and authority and dominion over you because what does he do what he's taking over he's taking over your life he took over your soul now let him take over your spirit and then after he's took over your spirit let him take over your body they'll change it he'll make you just like his glorified body when he rose from the grave he's changing us why cuz it's time it's time that's all these thousands of years it's time for a rapture it's time for speaking conditions it's time for the for the sons of God to be made manifest also here's the father which was the first son and holy ghost the spirit king of righteousness the Spirit attribute theophany king of peace theophany and in flesh he was king of kings same person he said why is it important for me to know all these things why is it important for me to have this kind of confidence to know who them who is this Melchizedek and all that seems like just kind of a lot of teaching and everything let's see if you remember that story brother branham told about that slave that when he came over he said after the boat before the bowler war and the Dutch were still bringing over slaves into America and the slave he walked with his head held high not like the other slaves but he was walking around carried himself he when they asked you to do something eating him and Hall he went and did it and he didn't act like a sluggard or a lazy a lazy bum or anything didn't happen like you say this old lay out of spirit they ought to see a spirit on him but he walked with his head held high and they began to ask why did why does he walk like that you know the reason he walked like that is because he knew where he came from he could look back into the book and know that his father was a king one day he was going to be a king - and you can look into the book you can look back into the book and a king of righteousness and know that you are part of that king and would call you part of that king you or a king - because he's King the king of kings I think that's one of the most fantastic things that he's not just a king by himself and not but but in a part of him part of that that great glorious mystical body is part of that the attributes that were in him that were released on the cross when he was when he was pierced to decide and his spirit left and water and blood his spirit out from his side came Kings is what came out and came you and me and spirit was released and it was able to come back into the end of the people on the day of Pentecost the king of kings King of Kings oh my I believe if we get a revelation of that that you are a king that you don't have to put up with the devil you don't have to put up with him causing you all kind of problems in your life and everything I'm not preaching all the sinless perfection like that there's got to be suffering there's got to be persecution there's got to be thinking you know if you think that there being a message of believer will make it all easy and everything listen with being a message believer will make people look down on you being a minister will make people think you're crazy like Paul said the foolishness - the foolishness of the preaching the gospel the preacher things like this talking about the king of righteousness and it was this book it is you crazy but yet it's through the foolish use of the gospel that that's giving us authority and power and dominion over the things of this world listen you don't have to we were used to people would preach about cigarette smoking and all that kind of stuff cuz you don't have to put up with that that's something that gives you authority over there and how do you get Authority you resist the devil and he will flee from you resist the devil resist the devil and all that alcoholism and cigarette smoking and lust of the flesh and all that stuff will leave and that what's revealed in the seals yeah he's left that he couldn't take it anymore then he had to leave he had to get on his horse and get out of there because the word is present and where the word where that king of Salem is he's got to hit the road let's read number three the Easter seal brother Gramps had noticed God's life which is in the Greek called Zoe moving through them and in them quicken their minds to his word now let me say it real quietly now the Spirit of God that moves among the people quick as the mind of the person to the promise of God see it does it look and I'm trying to show you that and let you realize that I'm speaking now of the church and also quicken the life in him although they only was his attributes to begin with they only was his attributes to begin with but if God said in this day back in the beginning John Doe will be my servant millions of years ago now now what happens back there before the foundation of the world if God's thinking in his mind he knew John Doe would be a Christian back there think about let's make it personal he's thinking he thought of you right now right now this morning I believe if one day you will accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and be filled with all he goes he thought of you you were in him not not just thinking but part of him you were an attribute waiting to be expressed alright let's keep going now John Doe was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lot say he's not come to the world when the Holy Ghost already any even though he was attribute in him before the foundation of the world he still he came to he bypass this thing off and he didn't come to the earth with a theophany is had he hit that briefly now John Doe is born and seen and shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lives because he's immortal but maybe he gets a little religious feeling he'll go join a church maybe he'll join Pentecostal church don't know he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of God once whoa what what I'm saying let him get under a good feeling what's the atmosphere of God it's your attitude toward the word the word not just a good feeling or something not just a good church service where everybody's singing songs that you like and everything somebody told me a few months ago they chose the church they went to because they sang the church the song that they liked that people don't go to churches or leave churches because of the word it's always something silly it's because somebody hurt their feelings because they didn't sing a song they didn't like the same song leaders all this kind of stuff what about the word let him get into the atmosphere of God once see John Doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as that eagle recognized who the mother was has got to realize that see only that John Doe is God's attribute they become a word spoken and then the Holy Spirit seeks that word out here it is he calls him gives him everlasting life and brings him into the presence of God God's word and how you think about this now how does God call you how does he call you if there's a little piece of word up there and in the mind of God waiting to be manifested when you hear that word spoken from behind the pulpit for people from off the tape that's God calling you and it falls into your heart and you believe and say that's got to be the truth and then what was that word receive connects back to the Father and now that God has called you back to himself that's what God is doing now he's and you receiving the word he's drawing you back up to himself he colony we jawed you by the spoken word because the spoken word is the original seed that's the original way that's the original way that the world was born was by the Word of God and that's the way that the Word of Life was falling down on the wood the out of the manger on the inside of your heart that word came to life because you heard it and believed it and then you say well I've got a right to go to any other Church because the songs they sing or anything like that you have no right to leave a church you have no right to go anywhere except where the word is preached where the true unadulterated word is preached they come right from the throne of God and when the Spirit of God comes upon you and you truly are one of God's attributes that he's spoken of now if you're not you'll wonder flush straight and running here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth if you are one of those that all things pass away right quick see and you become new and the plan of salvation is finished you're ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you see for you to do they you're ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you to do they never spoke of you cuz you've got something to do in it Jesus had something to do all of these had something to do and you've got something to do you've got something to do and that's not it's not to produce it you don't have to produce it all you got to do is believe it and he'll do the producing I think that's one thing so many people think today they've got to produce it they say well why I don't see nothing happening and they look around and don't see it looks like nothing's really happening but it ain't up to you to produce it it ain't up to you to manufacture something all it's up to you to do is believe it you just receive that word and something will happen I guarantee you something will happen because you can't help it when the word is preached when the word is spoken when the word is received the word will come up that's that's the law of God when the seed is planted in good ground it's gonna come up it'll come up before long and you might not see nothing down under the ground underneath the dirt that's see you down there something's happening though you just give it enough time and you'll see it come up you'll see it made manifest people I don't see nothing happening you know that's the scary thing if you don't see nothing happening that means that your eyes are not looking inward because we're not looking in what I can see I look back like the little woman that testified I sure ain't where I used to be I believe up when I when I look at myself and see I ain't where I used to be no more to see all the old things that I used to do all that I used to have a horrible temper up for years I carry this scar on my hand where I slung a fist and my brother and broke it on the wall I had this terrible temper but you know what I ain't like that no more cuz God will get a hold of you and he'll change you and you look back hanging like that anymore when you look when you look around and say I don't see nothing that happened how can you say that how could you say I don't see nothing happening when you look inward and see that God has changing you from the inside out how is he changing you he's taking dominion over you he's coming in and he's booting out the devil and he's leaving he's leaving himself well that wasn't my nurse your your ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you see for you to do you're submissive to his word the contract exactly the abstract to the contract the title deed belongs to you the debts are all paid it's all struck off and as it was at the day of Pentecost I didn't get through all this and and uh we're talking about that so we remember the king of righteousness the king of Salem which is the king of peace the king of Salem was the Jerusalem was called was was he short that down to Salem Jerusalem New Jerusalem is that Salem and the king of Salem is the king over that New Jerusalem so let's talk about that king of Salem because this king of Salem is that King theophany that came out of God I remember years ago I be I'd be laying on my bed and just devouring the word you you read the old things that the old sermons brother Brown preached about how that God was that fountain of life and how out from him came all all these attributes were in him and then out from him came that low loss that light the logos to the Kings theophany the king the king of Salem came out in the king of peace and and it was that word that came out that was as the way he said it the attribute of the fullness of God the attribute of the fullness of God the attribute of when it was a Nelly I'm waiting to be expressed you could not see you could not understand it but then that word stepped out and you could see exactly who he is if you could look on it with spiritual eyes and then it was that words theophany because brother Graham said God is not like just some kind of wafting spirit or something something without any kind of form or anything but that's the often you had a body and it had two hands and two feet and eyes much higher eyes and IR eyes much higher thinking than our thinking but it was a body a person somebody that you can actually fellowship with somebody the Abraham connect communing with somebody that Abraham could that Melchizedek Nash theophany could share part of himself within that communion that bread and that wine and and share some things about himself with and that's the Alpha knee that's the Alpha he began to keep coming down until they showed himself to Moses and showed himself showed himself to different ones but you finally it was veiled in the flesh of Jesus King Jesus let's read about that King theophany a little bit I can read here let's look at number five he said you shall see me that better all right you shall see me now if Christ and risen from the dead and we are given the invitation of the scripture that he promised that we could see him and that he would be the same yesterday today and forever and would you desire to see him would you if you'd raised your hands with every Christian believe that I would it with my hands up I would love to see him well now how can we see him the way we can see him is by his works now he hasn't coming a corporal body yet among us he's here in a spiritual body you believe that a spiritual body called the holy spirit he's in the form of the Holy Spirit at the beginning God was a spirit and all the fountain of goodness and mercy and all the good things of love God was the center of that fountain and then the logos that went out of God at the beginning become what would we would call a theophany or a supernatural body God is just not like the air but he's in a body Moses seen him pastors said it looked like the back part of a man and so forth and then that same theophan he was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld in the only begotten of the Father Christ now what kind of point are you trying to make brother ba a king of righteousness you were part of that king of righteousness because you were one of his attributes that was waiting to be expressed and when you heard the word preached for your day you received it and you were connected back to that that king of righteousness what about this king of Salem that this king of Salem was a body with hands and feet and you are part of that body when Jesus was when that's he often he was on the cross and that that earthly body that flesh was pierced it allowed that theophany body to come out so that it could come back in the people on the day of Pentecost you are part of that body you are let me tell you how much a part of that body you are you are so much a part of that body when brother Brown said it when Jesus stood on the shores of Galilee when he walked you were in that body you were identified in that body you were there well I was talking about earlier when he when he went down to hell you went to hell with him because the same life that you now having down in your soul that life was there in him that was the same life not a different life you are there as pre-existence of souls but you were there because that same life is now inside of you that same life now let's get it let's get real let's get real particularly here now when you were a kid and you went stole something out of the cookie jar and you put your hand in there and mama got you got in trouble with mama you pulled your hand out of the cookie jar and you say she'd say who stole cookies out of the cookie jar well my hand is no it was you did it your hand didn't do it you did it and so remember when we take communion wasn't it wasn't it Paul that said dessert do you not discern the body dessert do you not know what the body is when one of one thing afflicts one member of the body it afflicts the whole member of the body if one part of the body is spiritually sick it hinders the whole body if somebody's doing something out of place it hinders the whole body but what about when something good happens to the body because I believe when when brother Adam spoke those squirrels into existence he's part of the body so that happened to you and I when brother ran him on the shores of Galilee when he broke the bread and fishes everything that happened to you and I because we're part of that same body don't be looking at me like this is the foolishness of the gospel now when one thing happens to one part of the body it happens to the other and so we can go when when brother Dale called Randall back from the grave that happened to the body because he's part of the body when it happens to one point that's and so that that thereby there's no glorying at us when we lay hands on the sick and they recover and say well look at me look at the great faith I had because that's one great big glorious body God has manifested himself in the body of the church in the body of the believers and when God does something through one believer he's doing it through the body not not so that we could glory or anything listen if if any of these ministers come up here and preach a scathing sermon that'll get us to repent I don't say well goodness goodness me what if I could preach like that because it's the body it's the body there's no glory over here and there's no it's one great big body don't you see that's what this is where he started with his feet in the feet and he's building us up to the head there's one big body and he's manifesting himself and us as you receive the word one body what's he doing this this king of Salem the king of peace he's the king of peace but he's not the king of peace to the devil he's gay let me say this right not peace to the devil not peaceful to the devil to bring peace he's bringing Dominion and power and an authority into the devil's domain because this is the devil's domain and he's the Prince and power of the air he's you know he offered all these things to Jesus when he tempted him or if you bow down and worship Me I'll give you all these things I'll give you this all this domain but God is he's coming down to the Prince of Peace to kick out the devil you know you think well I can have peace in this life if I just ignore that thirst that God has given me I can have I can have peace if I just if I just obey the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and go out and fulfill fulfilled my carnal desires and all these kind of things you know there's no peace and just kind of sitting there in a daze in a fog staring at video games all day there's no peace going out to the bars and the clubs and all that stuff the only real peace comes through a relationship with the king of peace through Jesus Christ because he said I'll give you my peace he had peace when he stood there on that fishing boat and the storm came up when he was down and the bowels of the boat the other disciples didn't have peace but they were wondering how can you sleep through all this but he came up he came up from the boat and he said peace be still but he made that promise to us that I'll give you of my peace what's he giving us he's given us to eat of it to partake of that theophany that's the often in life that's down on the inside of a real believer which is what the attribute of the fullness of God that theophany isn't that's the offer T is they're all and all the attribute every with everything that God is and when he comes and puts that inside of you then he makes you a king I'm gonna jump on here cuz I don't want no it's Wednesday night I thought I'd be done in 30 minutes let's remember eight who was this milk kids day and Hebrews chapter six brother I'm said well this is Melchizedek king of Salem which is Jerusalem Prince of the Most High certainly who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him too also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness that great love that great spirit in the beginning king of righteousness after that king of Salem which is the king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days or ending life who was it he never was born he never will die who is that it was God sure it was in the foreshadow of the Lord Jesus certainly was but he had to come through a woman in the order you come through a woman and he had to come the way you come in order to bring you back to him he had to go see his condescending he come come down from the attribute to word theophany to flesh and he's taking you back he's taking you back now you come in flesh he took he's taking you back to restore you back from where you came from and you say why do I need to know where I came from you need to know where you came from so you can know what to manifest you can hear something you can know what to pray for what to ask for what to what you should be doing in this life that great Melchizedek the manifested word and peace his peace when he gives it to you it brings you joy it brings you happiness it brings you said why why does it bring you joy because you see the whole stuff that all life being chopped away you know you think about the Christian journey when you start you know you start coming to church and and and and it feels like the word and can be biting as it's chopping off things from your life that shouldn't be there and it's hurtful and things and things are saying it might might make a little tender hothouse Christian a little bit hurt a little bit but then one day brother Graham said this is a quote now he said one day you'll feel like the preacher ain't preaching at you anymore Wow cuz that's the actual quote I'll find it if anybody is there one day you'll feel like the preacher and preaching at you anymore why the preacher I'm preaching at you it's the word coming across the pulpit then that's cutting away at you and there's some things in your life that ain't right things that because he's molding you into the image into that perfect masterpiece and and the closer is what it does it brings peace to you because I ain't like that anymore I you see your life being changed you see your life being molded you see sin leaving let me let me jump ahead in my nose to the King of Kings I really don't want to keep everybody late 1st Timothy 6 I'm trying y'all 1st Timothy chapter 6 13 to 16 this is the one that I read when I started I give the chart Paul to Timothy I give thee charge on the side of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spot run rebuke Abul until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ which in his times he shall show he was going to show and it's manifesting time it's time to show all these things dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom the honor and power everlasting amen so he's made us so we talked about king of righteousness king of salem king of kings because when he puts himself inside of you he gives you authority over the devil what what scripture what scriptures is that fulfilling it's fulfilling that scripture where Melchizedek promised Abraham your seed will possess the in the gates of the enemy your seed will possess the gates of the enemy all these other scriptures that that speak of how that the devil would be under your feet and all these things you don't listen you don't have to put up with the devil in your life I think I think now is the time where the devil is it like brother Wade was preaching on all those thousands and thousands of demons that went after the Jews now they're released on the bride if now they're after us how much more should we be in the word how much more authority and Dominion should we have if God has given it to us if it's an attribute that was written in him before the foundation of the world now it's time for that attribute to be made manifest it's time for us to resist the devil and not not giving him because look it's story time I'm gonna get into a story cuz listen there's a lot of kings in the Bible that could look back into the scripture and see what God said about them like Josiah Josiah was written there in first Kings it said just some a profit out of nowhere come up out of the wilderness ran to the altar and said there's gonna be a man a little boy raised up named Josiah that's gonna tear down these offers and burn the people that burnt that burnt incense upon this altar and Josiah later on in second Kings the little boy eight years old were raised up and they put a crown on his head and and I believe now this is just me maybe but he could look back in first Kings look back and see what that prophet had said about him he could look back and see well I'm I'm going it's written to me to go tear down these altars it's written to me to go destroy and to utterly purge all the land and you know he was just a little boy he was just a little eight-year-old boy but you think about you think well you got to be an adult or something you got to be old to be a good Christian no listen listen there's plenty of people Daniel the young people that went down into the Babylon Daniel and all the three Hebrew children they were just young mean a day you would lay before the Lord three times a day and he said when they wanted him to eat all the things that were prohibited it for him for them to eat he said we're not gonna eat that but we're gonna trust in the Lord and you think about Daniel and all the ones that they testament all the ones in the news there were young man you don't have to be old you don't have to be ancient to believe the gospel but the one I want to talk about is David because David was the one that was taken out of the sheep coat and they and they and Samuel the Prophet came and and went through all of his brothers and finally got down to the one where I don't have anymore bring somebody do you have anybody else it looked like even his dad was like now surely not David but they went out and brought David in and they they Samuel anointed him with oil but he didn't quite enter the kingdom yet there was a little bit of time and you because you see David was anointed three times before he took the kingdom one two three three times before he took the kingdom but look look how his attitude changed see we brought around told us how he he went through some things before that anointing oil was a report on his head first team that that bear came to attack the sheep and and he gave that testimony later on God was able to deliver me of that from that bear from that line he was able to do those things for me like God was taking him through justification and sanctification God was able to do that for me but then without anointing oil was poured on his head he knew he was gonna come to his kingship because it had have been spoken for him he was gonna be it was written of him to fulfill the kingship he was going to be a king and so with anything stood in his way he approached it with authority with Dominion just the way a real believer has to today how do you how do you approach when the devil comes at you when the devil comes at you with lies and things I remember when I when their Lord but first began dealing with me and maybe the devil began to deal with me differently than a lot of other people if you might call it schizophrenia or something but I began to hear voices and I would hear a voice that would tell me all day long it would speak to me and say you ain't you can't be a real Christian you can't you can't fulfill this word this is for you you've already passed your that the day in the hour that you could be a Christian you've already blaspheme and it will constantly rail at me it costantly but yeah I ran in the Bible reading the message where brother Brown said you fight back at the gate of the devil with the word you fight back just the same way that Jesus fought back against the devil so I began to quote to him I began to speak to him but you're a liar that God is still able and I remember I read that scripture where it said Jesus told the disciples he said it God is able of these stones to raise up children unto me and I would quote that back to the devil I said if that scripture was true back there and it's got to be true now if God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham so you speak you speak back to the devil and here you resist him and he'll leave you he'll leave you alone eventually and so that's what David did when when he was confronted with Goliath he spoke to the sick of life goliath was own dalish territory david was the king over all Israel and Goliath came in there to mess with his authority with his Dominion and some when he came when he sold when he saw glass railing at all the people all the Israelites he said why why has nobody else going up against this giant and you know maybe sometimes sometimes when you're sitting in message churches and looking around you wonder why why is nobody else going up why is nobody else trying to tack on the devil has nobody else going up let me let me read if I can find it what he said and David said unto Saul thy serpent kept us at Lissa's 1st Samuel 17 and 34 to 37 David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and went out and I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he rose against me I called him by his beard and smote him as fluid that service slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he has to fire the armies of the Living God my and we could God's Word like that if we could take God's Word we have sickness in our members when we have things in our a like I said whatever take God's Word when you're looking at a body change David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out on the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee that same god that was able to deliver me out of the paw of the lion out of the hands of the line sometimes I think we forget what God has done for us I was talking to a Christian recently that he was he was thinking I just can't remember the last time that God did anything for me personally I've seen God do life and so you know what I did I began to quote back to him the things that I had seen God do it is like sometimes we need one another to remind us of the things that that have happened because the same God that brought you out of those things before the same God is able to deliver you from this Goliath whatever that Goliath might be God is able to deliver he listen he's able to restore your children he's able to bring them back you just got to speak it speaking like David did it's got a spoken word as the original seed somebody's got to speak it and might as well be you let's keep reading the first signal 1744 and the Philistines said to David come to me well it's another devil will do this is the devil speaking to David it just like the devil spoke to me come to me and I will give that flesh under the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field listen David answer back with a backbone not a little old wishy-washy where I may be and maybe I'll go to church this Sunday maybe I'll try to do the things that are required of me as a Christian maybe I'll maybe I'll do it but he asked her back with boldness because he was a king and you are a king you are one of the one of the Kings Kings a child of the king thou comes to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the God of the armies of Israel whom thou has defied this day will the Lord deliver the end of mine hand and I will smite the end not hand head from the and I will give the caucuses of the host of the Philistines this day under the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly shall know that the Lord save us not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and He will give you into our hands and we read about how David ran to meet him but look this is how David conducted himself through all those anointings and through each anointing more and more of his den amis died away at the second anointing assal had just died away not at the hand of David but it was God that cleared the way for him to become king at the phial anointing when he became king ish persist had just passed away and not at the hand of David it was a devar that did it it's not you it has to produce it God will do the producing at the end of the end the end of it then all the children of Israel came and crown crowned David and what was their testimony their testimony was said they said you we are bone of that bone and flesh of thy flesh where thy bone and not flesh and that sounds a lot like Adam's testimony of Eve she is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh see you got that you got to come to authority and Dominion but to get there it's gonna take a lot of persecution it takes a lot of trials it takes where people look like people at church talking about you it takes all kinds of sorrow and a long nights of agonizing prayer and reading and studying and getting in the word and then finally you'll come forth victorious through those three anointings the musicians can come because what is it God is making himself manifest in the bride God is manifesting himself who is this Melchizedek who is Melchizedek is the self same person all down to history he's the self same one he was the one that was the word before the foundation of the world the Son of God that spoke the world into existence he was the one that came and walked with Adam and even garden he was the one that killed that lamb and put the put the lamb skills over him he was the one that veiled him said they bailed himself under the badger skins of the wilderness and the one that veiled himself Tavern at Tabernacle in Jesus Christ and now Melchizedek availing himself and you the king of righteousness the king of Salem and King Jesus the King of Kings do gospel ship receive [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] we've got the número and lay everything off same courtesy [Music] see if you'd if you would say is her brother was ministering there thinking about it the other day sit down in the wood a little bit thinking about you know if you say that there's nothing going on if you say there's nothing going on then that means you are blind because it's no work the debt can be brought from the bottom now come and show you show me that could be brought from the Bible talk with the nine because there's no native preacher it can't be done the Bible declares that we are his children the Bible declares is all we got to do is believe it so then what's making us say nothing's taking place is that devil it sure ain't the Holy Ghost you show me the Holy Ghost it tells you any horror nothing's going on come on you can't do it cuz it won't work see you just think little David no David that's English you realize that could have killed him they get garden was dark what about all these flu bugs and the things their buddies had when we was telling you last weekend about the brother down there that that he'd come down with the flu he wound up on life support yes and what we call a flu bug you better believe something's taking place you better believe something is here to take place Cody's always been here I will be with you always now to show you just a little son I'm just saying there's me you think nothing's going on I was sitting down in the woods hung the phone right I looked at the phone I don't recognize that number so I won't answer you know I thought well I better I put it up to my ear and I said hello the voice said poppy I said well I know that voice gotta be somebody that's related you know in some way to call me poppy papa I said yes I said who is this she's this sister Anna but that time voices come in behind we were on a three-way hookup between sister Anna my phone and the paramedics that was on the way you tell me how that happened she said I just called you to tell you to pray for him but she had to be called in at the same time the paramedics was talking to her you understand we think that God is not here he can take care of the other side : as your brother said why can't we say you want stay all night and listen to testimonies I don't we believe it's because of our unbelief at least we could pray lord help down my unbelief that should be at least our prior to believe I see God is real we've seen him in ever form that could be thought of from the dead raised healed of everything signs and wonders whatever when Zach was born come down with this they were what you called it I don't know their towns or what they would call it but he turned yellow in other words and and had to put him under a light and take care of it and they called me I was hunting and I went to pray I prayed for he was Lord you know I believed it I got back in touch with him I said call my wife I said how's he doing she's with us they're still wondering what this is I said do you think I need to come home he said yes for them you need to come I said I don't have to worry he's healed I've said I'm coming home from that very moment God started changing things why can't we believe it how much do you need but to hear a message like we've heard tonight that message is enough because it's his word let's believe it make sure you tell her brother how much you appreciate the message man telling that you appreciate it we do we certainly do appreciate you change all of the ministry believing God's was father we just commit everything into your hands now believing you Lord we know that your word is true and this had been brought to naught to us her brother has given his heart to us and now we just take that and believe within our heart all things are possible to them that believe and thank you Lord why would we doubt anything why would we have any powder take us out of a saying nothing ain't going on if we're taking one breath of air something's going on if we're alive today something's going on we're healed something's going on anything that's in your room it's always true we love you and we thank you be with everybody on the way home give a safe journey and let your loving grace be there thank you for all things we love you in Jesus name you
