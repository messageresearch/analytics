[6:35] christ we pray amen
[6:39] luke chapter 2 we're going to begin at
[6:41] verse 25 and it says
[6:42] behold there was a man in jerusalem
[6:45] whose name was simeon
[6:47] and the same man was just and devout
[6:49] waiting for the consolation of israel
[6:52] and the holy ghost was upon him and it
[6:54] was revealed unto him by the holy ghost
[6:57] that he should
[6:59] not see death before he had seen the
[7:01] lord's christ
[7:02] and he came by the spirit into the
[7:04] temple and when the parents brought into
[7:08] in the child jesus to do for him after
[7:12] the custom of the law
[7:14] then took he him
[7:16] up in his arms and blessed god and said
[7:18] lord now let us thou thy servant depart
[7:21] in peace according to thy word for mine
[7:24] eyes have seen thy salvation which thou
[7:27] hast prepared before the face of all
[7:30] people a light to lighten the gentiles
[7:33] and the glory of thy people israel
[7:36] and joseph and his mother marveled at
[7:38] those things which were spoken of him
[7:42] and simeon blessed them and said
[7:45] unto mary his mother behold this child
[7:47] is set
[7:49] for the fall and rising again of many in
[7:51] israel and for a sign which shall be
[7:54] spoken against yea a sword shall pierce
[7:57] through thy own soul also
[8:00] that the thoughts of many hearts
[8:03] may be revealed
[8:04] amen god bless you tonight and be seated
[8:10] and so
[8:14] i want to look at
[8:16] when looking at the life of
[8:18] of jesus
[8:21] and
[8:23] picking up from
[8:24] kind of background a little bit from
[8:26] what we were talking about last time
[8:29] when we were talking about
[8:32] in in the book of
[8:34] matthew
[8:35] and matthew
[8:37] uses this expression
[8:39] numerous times
[8:42] but he talks about that it might be
[8:44] fulfilled
[8:46] and we go back and and we look there and
[8:48] and matthew the first chapter
[8:51] and when it talks about the birth of
[8:52] jesus
[8:55] and it and it begins to talk about
[8:58] what was to take place
[9:02] and when when the
[9:04] the angel when gabriel came and spoke to
[9:07] mary and told him what was going to take
[9:09] place
[9:10] of what was what was prophesied
[9:12] and he said you shall bring that ye
[9:14] shall bring forth a son and thou shalt
[9:16] call his name jesus for he shall save
[9:18] his people from their sins
[9:20] and said all this was done that it might
[9:22] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[9:24] lord by the prophet saying behold a
[9:26] virgin shall be with child and shall
[9:28] bring forth a son and they shall call
[9:30] his name emmanuel which being
[9:32] interpreted is god with us
[9:36] so when we go back and look and and many
[9:39] times there there are several times in
[9:40] in the book of matthew where matthew
[9:42] says that it might be fulfilled he goes
[9:43] back and talks about jeremiah and the
[9:45] different prophets the different
[9:47] different prophecies that were fulfilled
[9:49] in jesus's life that would and so he
[9:51] began to speak of these things and as we
[9:53] were talking about last time that when
[9:55] we go back to the scripture and we
[9:56] realized that when the when the
[9:59] fulfillment of the of the word when the
[10:01] prophets began to speak you know the the
[10:04] people were looking
[10:06] forward to the prophecy
[10:09] but when they began to look and look
[10:11] ahead to the prophecies of what was
[10:13] being spoken when they looked forward
[10:15] they couldn't see
[10:17] clearly they couldn't see the prophecy
[10:19] clearly
[10:20] because it took a prophet to come back
[10:22] and point them back to the word
[10:24] because they began to fall away from the
[10:27] word
[10:28] and so as as the as we know as the
[10:32] prophets begin to speak you know because
[10:34] that's how god said that he would
[10:36] declare his word to his people that he
[10:37] would he would make himself known in his
[10:40] word and and as amos 3 tells us that he
[10:43] would do nothing except he would reveal
[10:45] his his secret through his servants the
[10:47] prophets so we know that the prophets
[10:49] began to speak and and as they began to
[10:51] make itself known through the prophets
[10:54] yet the it took a profit for them to
[10:57] bring to bring them back to the word
[10:59] because and in time because that was the
[11:02] uh method that god had used
[11:05] and as he began to speak then people
[11:07] began to uh take on their own
[11:10] interpretation of the word
[11:12] and then it would take it would take a
[11:14] profit to bring the people back to the
[11:16] word so that they could see the word
[11:18] clearly
[11:19] and so as as time began to continue on
[11:22] as we look through all the different
[11:23] prophets as they begin brother brown
[11:25] said that they they built the body so we
[11:27] know that as the word went forth he
[11:29] began to uh make himself known in his
[11:33] word
[11:34] but it was a but it was a secret to the
[11:36] people but he because and as it become
[11:39] to as we were talking about as it began
[11:41] to unfold didn't become a mystery
[11:43] because then it became something that
[11:45] wasn't clear to the people
[11:48] as you know as as our illustration was
[11:51] last time when you when you try to
[11:53] express something
[11:55] and
[11:56] and you don't know
[11:58] clearly
[12:00] then and it's a secret
[12:03] but in the unfolding
[12:06] there is a revelation but there's also a
[12:08] mystery
[12:10] as we were speaking of last time you
[12:12] know because you know there was a
[12:14] brother said god had a mystery secret
[12:17] that he wanted to reveal to the people
[12:19] he wanted to make himself known and you
[12:21] know as as we were talking last time you
[12:23] know if if you have something that that
[12:25] you have shared with somebody
[12:28] and nobody else knows that
[12:30] then that's the secret
[12:33] which is exactly amos 3 when he said it
[12:35] because when he began to reveal himself
[12:36] to the prophets then that was making
[12:38] known to that secret because the prophet
[12:40] saw that
[12:42] but then they began to declare that
[12:45] but when it became when it began to been
[12:47] spoke then when they began to unveil the
[12:51] mystery
[12:52] yet there was a mystery there because
[12:54] they didn't understand
[12:56] when god spoke to isaiah and told him
[12:58] behold a virgin shall conceive
[13:01] well when god spoke to isaiah that was
[13:04] that was a mystery that was that was a
[13:06] secret but when he began to declare that
[13:09] well then how in the world is a virgin
[13:11] gonna conceive
[13:13] well because that's contrary to the word
[13:16] because that's contrary to the way that
[13:18] that thing
[13:19] nature was to take place
[13:23] because you know let every seed bring
[13:25] after its own kind
[13:28] and so it's like well this is this is
[13:30] something new this is tough well how's
[13:31] this supposed to take place even if even
[13:33] isaiah didn't understand the things that
[13:35] he said
[13:36] even when we go back and we look at the
[13:38] prophets and the things that they saw in
[13:40] the visions and they began to speak the
[13:42] words even they didn't understand
[13:44] everything that they were saying but you
[13:46] know what they began to express exactly
[13:48] what they saw
[13:51] and and that in their expressing see
[13:54] then then there was a time that yeah it
[13:56] was people were trying to
[13:58] take take what they heard and they kept
[14:00] trying to wrestle with and trying to
[14:02] understand it but you know it wasn't
[14:04] time for that
[14:06] well because god is his own interpreter
[14:08] so when god came to the place god was
[14:11] going to
[14:12] reveal the word he was going to
[14:13] interpret his own word
[14:15] he would make it known
[14:18] but as time we know that that they they
[14:20] tried to um build their own
[14:23] organizations their own denominations as
[14:25] brother branham said you know they took
[14:26] the word and they uh tried to build
[14:29] their own understanding and tried to
[14:31] build it all up to themselves and not
[14:33] waiting on god to reveal the word to
[14:35] them
[14:41] and we see how they
[14:43] built denominations
[14:46] so when the word came to be fulfilled
[14:51] then they missed the word that had been
[14:53] brought to them
[14:56] because here here's the fulfillment of
[14:58] the word jesus of as as as the prophets
[15:01] built the body as the opening of the
[15:03] word came then when the word came forth
[15:05] then jesus became that manifestation of
[15:08] the word that had been preached all the
[15:10] way down through history but when he
[15:12] stepped out there then they said who is
[15:14] this
[15:15] even when even in the scripture when we
[15:17] talk when we look at uh in isaiah
[15:21] even when isaiah 1 when the scripture
[15:24] tells us and we begin to look at the
[15:26] scriptures that relate to the messiah
[15:28] him coming and you know he says that he
[15:31] would send his messenger before his face
[15:34] and he said there would be one a voice
[15:36] crying in the wilderness
[15:38] so when when that when the scripture
[15:40] began to say that there was a forerunner
[15:41] that would be coming that would be
[15:43] pointing them back
[15:45] then when even when when the forerunner
[15:47] came when john the baptist stepped out
[15:51] and here he is standing in the
[15:53] fulfillment of the word and he stands
[15:55] out there and he begins to proclaim that
[15:57] this is the day that these scripture
[16:00] would be fulfilled
[16:01] as as now now is the time that the word
[16:04] would come forth he said he said there's
[16:06] someone amongst us now he said that i'm
[16:08] unworthy to unloose his shoes
[16:12] and he began to speak and he began to
[16:14] proclaim to the people said listen
[16:16] you've been waiting for a messiah all
[16:18] these years
[16:19] you've been waiting for this fulfillment
[16:22] you know many times brother branham
[16:23] tells the story he said you know he was
[16:25] talking about mary and joseph sitting on
[16:27] the porch reading these scrolls and and
[16:29] talking about what the what the rabbis
[16:31] had to say and all these things and you
[16:32] know they were pondering whether this
[16:34] would be true would we see this in our
[16:36] lifetime
[16:38] is this going to be something that's
[16:39] going to take place but you know and and
[16:42] no doubt there were people that as they
[16:44] began to hear these things you know it
[16:46] become goal to their hearing they just
[16:48] become
[16:49] just old wives fables it's just
[16:51] something that we do in a religious duty
[16:53] but there were some people that began to
[16:55] hold on to that and believe that there
[16:57] was one day coming that there was going
[16:59] to be a fulfillment of the word the word
[17:01] would be fulfilled that he would come
[17:03] just as just as as moses as prophesied
[17:06] in jeremiah and isaiah and all these
[17:08] ones that had prophesied that he would
[17:10] come and fulfill the word
[17:13] and no matter how how dark it got and
[17:16] how how lacks the people god or whatever
[17:18] yet there were some people that had the
[17:20] desire to hear the word
[17:22] to hold on to that calling where i don't
[17:24] know where he's going to come i don't
[17:25] know anything about it but i do know
[17:27] that the scripture tells us that the
[17:29] scrolls have told us the prophets have
[17:31] told us these things that he's coming
[17:36] but everybody had their own own ideas
[17:39] they had their own thoughts
[17:41] as brother brown talked about you know
[17:42] one believed it this way one believed it
[17:44] that way
[17:46] when you go back and look and see what
[17:48] the old
[17:49] and when you go back and read history
[17:50] and some of what some of the rabbis
[17:52] talked
[17:54] it's it's amazing that anybody believed
[17:56] anything
[17:57] why because but we see that it was that
[17:59] was to be the time and the day in which
[18:02] they lived that was to be the
[18:04] fulfillment of the word
[18:06] one because there would be a great life
[18:08] there wouldn't be reve the
[18:10] revelation of the word but yet there
[18:12] would still be people that would be
[18:14] groping in in gross darkness
[18:17] in that day when when the greatest light
[18:20] came when jesus came manifested in flesh
[18:23] and then people still walked in gross
[18:25] darkness why because that was the day
[18:27] and hour which they lived
[18:30] and it was prophesied that it would take
[18:33] place
[18:36] and there they are
[18:39] you know couldn't believe what was going
[18:41] to take place
[18:44] so many
[18:46] so many rabbis had argued over
[18:49] what was going to take place would you
[18:51] know there's so many of them that when
[18:53] they talked about the messiah coming
[18:55] they somewhat even even have argued
[18:57] about whether he would actually be god
[19:00] made manifest or not
[19:01] or would he just be a man anointed by
[19:04] god
[19:06] and all of all the scriptures that and
[19:08] so when he began begun when when jesus
[19:10] came and he began to speak and he began
[19:13] to identify himself and then he stood
[19:14] there and he told them and they wanted
[19:16] to stone him and he said he said why
[19:18] would you want to stone me he said
[19:20] because you make yourself god
[19:23] why it was contrary to their own own
[19:26] thinking brotherhood said it was his own
[19:27] denominational idea that they held on to
[19:32] and you know you go back all the way
[19:34] through the scripture and
[19:36] i believe solomon tells us he said
[19:37] there's nothing new under the sun
[19:40] and when you when you go back and you
[19:41] look into the scriptures even and we
[19:44] look at things today of the beliefs that
[19:47] people have of the scriptures and you
[19:49] know there's ten thousand different
[19:51] denominations of people believing the
[19:53] scripture and they all believe believe
[19:54] the same blunderly the same book
[19:59] they all believe the same thing well you
[20:01] know what this is this is
[20:03] the scripture this is what we base our
[20:05] beliefs off of
[20:08] but then there's so many of them that
[20:09] have have taken it and cut it and sliced
[20:12] it and pulled it apart
[20:16] and it's like well exactly what part of
[20:18] it will you actually stand on
[20:21] is this god's word or does it contain
[20:24] god's word
[20:27] so when they begin to when they begin to
[20:29] take these things and they and the
[20:31] rabbis began to study the the old
[20:33] testament and and the prophecies and all
[20:35] these things and and no doubt they were
[20:37] great scholar scholarly men and and had
[20:40] studied spent their whole life and
[20:42] studying the scriptures and knew all the
[20:44] words and and knew every little jot and
[20:46] tittle and all these things and yet they
[20:48] still didn't understand when the when
[20:50] the prophecy came when the fulfillment
[20:52] of the word came they still missed it
[20:54] they still argued over it
[20:57] but you know we we go back and you look
[20:58] at all of these old uh
[21:01] these rabbis and and
[21:04] looking at the things that that were
[21:05] taught
[21:07] you know i mean so many things when you
[21:09] began to look at the prophecies that
[21:11] were in the old testament and you began
[21:13] to look at what they had to say
[21:17] one of the
[21:18] things that stood out to me i was i was
[21:20] doing some reading and i was telling
[21:22] brother joe and them
[21:24] you know we have we have people
[21:27] still arguing in the in the 70 weeks of
[21:29] daniel
[21:30] in the prophecy whether there's you know
[21:33] one week left or is there a half week
[21:36] left is 69 half 69 and a half finished
[21:39] or only 69
[21:41] finished and
[21:43] and you if you don't want to
[21:45] see something that's
[21:47] convoluted
[21:50] some of these rabbis have tried to
[21:51] figure out
[21:53] even from the old writings some some
[21:55] have tried to take and put all this
[21:57] together and i mean they're they were
[21:59] arguing years ago about is there one
[22:02] week left in the in the 70 weeks or is
[22:05] only a half week
[22:07] and it's like you know there's nothing
[22:09] new under the sun there's still those
[22:11] spirits are still here people are still
[22:13] arguing over the same things and they're
[22:15] still arguing you know
[22:18] of those of the scriptures it's the same
[22:21] thing that people had way back then it's
[22:23] not changed any they're still here and
[22:25] they're still are getting the same
[22:26] points
[22:32] and so you know they still argue
[22:35] all of these all these points and yet
[22:38] yet they they still want to hold and
[22:40] still claim these things but yet when
[22:43] when the the
[22:46] rabbis had had taught all these things
[22:48] and the people that heard all these
[22:49] things and yet
[22:51] it would only take a profit
[22:54] that could identify the time the day and
[22:57] the hour in which the people were living
[22:59] and point them in the right direction
[23:01] why because there had been so much
[23:03] denominational
[23:04] mess up there had been so much
[23:06] denominational in injection
[23:10] of all this denominational seed had been
[23:13] injected into the word and all this
[23:15] stuff that that when he began to preach
[23:17] that when jesus came and he spoke to the
[23:20] disciples i mean into the to the uh
[23:23] pharisees and the sadducees and all of
[23:25] them and he began to point them back to
[23:26] the scripture
[23:29] and then when he began to speak then he
[23:30] told you know he began to say to them
[23:33] you know search the scriptures
[23:37] in them you say you have eternal life
[23:39] but they are they that testify of me
[23:42] the scriptures he said he said he as
[23:45] they stood up and said one day he said
[23:47] oh he said abraham is our father he said
[23:50] he said if abe if abraham was your
[23:52] father he said abraham would rejoice to
[23:55] see my day
[23:57] abraham rejoiced to see this day abraham
[24:00] longed to see this day and yet you say
[24:02] that you're the seed of abraham and here
[24:05] you are walking in the day and you still
[24:07] don't see it
[24:08] and you're blind to the word
[24:11] and you've rejected it
[24:14] but he began to speak to him
[24:17] and tell them see he began to show them
[24:19] the scriptures
[24:20] and yet they denied the scripture
[24:23] why because as brother brahma said he
[24:24] didn't fit their denominational idea
[24:29] they had their own uh
[24:31] i did
[24:32] their own teaching their own beliefs
[24:34] about these things so when he began to
[24:36] speak and he began to walk
[24:40] why because it was so humble that it was
[24:42] that it would pass the people by they
[24:43] didn't even see it
[24:45] when the scripture tells us that
[24:51] in isaiah
[24:52] isaiah 40
[24:55] it says the voice of him that crieth in
[24:57] the wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[24:59] lord make straight in the desert a
[25:02] highway for our god
[25:04] he said every valley shall be exalted
[25:06] and every mountain and hill shall be
[25:07] made low
[25:11] and the crooked shall be made straight
[25:13] and the rough places plain and the glory
[25:16] of the lord shall be revealed and all
[25:18] flesh shall see it together for the
[25:20] mouth of the lord hath spoken it
[25:24] so when they begin to see hey there's
[25:26] forerunner is coming this one that's
[25:27] going to be a voice crying in the
[25:29] wilderness to prepare the way of the
[25:31] lord
[25:32] and when john walks out of the out of
[25:34] the wilderness and he comes out there
[25:36] wearing a
[25:37] camel skin eating locust and wild honey
[25:40] looking like a crazy man when he walks
[25:42] out there into the water and he begins
[25:44] to identify this the time in which he
[25:46] lived and he began to tell them this is
[25:49] the hour that we are to make known the
[25:51] christ
[25:53] the messiah is coming and then you know
[25:55] we began to speak of these of this
[25:57] scripture of being the voice of one
[25:59] crying in the wilderness
[26:03] well no when you know how do you how do
[26:06] you place this in the scripture when
[26:08] when you when you have the the high
[26:10] priest campuses and all the different
[26:12] ones that were so uh exalted and and
[26:15] they're teaching and they're learning
[26:17] and all these things and when they come
[26:18] out there then you know why didn't we
[26:20] you know why did as brother ram said you
[26:22] know he didn't come down on a great
[26:24] uh cloud of and at a golden staircase
[26:28] and all kinds of different things you
[26:30] know where he didn't just walk down to
[26:31] the high priest and identify himself
[26:34] but he came such a lowly humble birth
[26:38] and when when here's here's this wild
[26:40] man walking out and the scripture says
[26:42] that you know um
[26:45] you know every every mountain shall be
[26:47] and he'll shall be made low the crooked
[26:49] shall be straight the rough place is
[26:51] made plain
[26:53] when nothing changed it was still the
[26:56] same rocky ground it was still the same
[26:59] dirt it was distill it was everything
[27:01] was the same
[27:02] here we are how are we trying to find
[27:04] you know where is it where is this great
[27:06] happiness going to take place that that
[27:08] the prophet isaiah told us about
[27:12] all we're seeing is a crazy man come out
[27:13] of the woods and he's standing there and
[27:15] he's speaking and he's trying to drown
[27:17] people
[27:18] and he begins to speak of the of this
[27:20] this man coming
[27:24] and here here is this man and the only
[27:26] and the only man that he points to and
[27:27] he calls out says behold the lamb of god
[27:30] who takes away the sin of the world and
[27:32] the only man he identifies is a man that
[27:34] had a had a bad reputation his mother
[27:38] had ill reputation and that's the man
[27:41] that he's identifying as the messiah
[27:45] he's like you know this is crazy
[27:48] and yet it was a glorious thing that
[27:50] that all of the prophets began to look
[27:52] for you know that isaiah and all the
[27:54] different ones and then when it came to
[27:56] pass it was so lowly it was so humble
[27:59] but it was so great one because that's
[28:01] the way god works he hides himself in
[28:03] simplicity reveals himself in simplicity
[28:06] but the people missed it
[28:08] but to the ones that were that were
[28:10] called those that were they were
[28:12] spirit-filled that were called to them
[28:14] to receive that that were led by the
[28:17] spirit those were the ones that called
[28:19] it
[28:27] not everyone was
[28:28] called to understand that not everyone
[28:31] was called to catch that vision not
[28:33] everybody was called to see that
[28:38] but you know what
[28:40] they call
[28:42] what was what was given to them
[28:45] they didn't he didn't answer all of
[28:46] their questions it didn't it didn't it
[28:48] didn't bring everything into clarity but
[28:51] there was something that was revealed to
[28:52] them by god that it caught their
[28:54] attention that they held on to that
[28:58] when jesus began to speak to peter and
[29:00] he told him he said he said who do men
[29:02] say that i the son of man am and when he
[29:04] began to identify who he was that the
[29:07] people said oh you're one of the
[29:08] prophets you know and all the different
[29:10] things as they were talking he said but
[29:13] who do you say that i am who do you say
[29:15] that i the son of man am
[29:18] and see peter began to speak by his own
[29:20] revelation because he said thou art the
[29:23] christ the son of the living god why
[29:24] because it was something that had been
[29:26] revealed to him
[29:27] they didn't he didn't answer all of
[29:29] peter's questions when when when
[29:33] it was a nathaniel
[29:35] was sitting under the
[29:37] uh the fig tree there and you know when
[29:39] andrew come to him and and told him he
[29:41] said come see this man
[29:43] isn't this the one that that we've heard
[29:45] about all our lives isn't this the one
[29:47] and when he came
[29:49] he said is there any good thing that can
[29:51] come out of nazareth
[29:54] he said well listen he said he said
[29:55] don't take my word for it he said why
[29:57] don't you just come and listen to the
[29:59] man
[30:00] why don't you just come and hear what he
[30:02] has to say
[30:04] and when he when he'd come up and then
[30:06] jesus told him said listen he said look
[30:08] here here's a man within whom there is
[30:10] no gal
[30:12] and he said he said rabbi when did you
[30:14] know me how do you know how do you know
[30:16] anything about me
[30:17] he said he said before andrew called you
[30:19] and you sat under the fig tree he said i
[30:21] saw you
[30:23] he said he said see that that he knew
[30:25] something that took place one because it
[30:26] was a a revelation something that took
[30:28] an experience that he had before jesus
[30:32] that he called something well he didn't
[30:34] answer all of his questions but you know
[30:36] what there was something that took place
[30:38] that caught his that he gripped him that
[30:40] he began to follow the things that jesus
[30:43] had to say that he began to walk in
[30:45] after
[30:48] jesus you know there's so many times
[30:51] that when people when people get begin
[30:53] to look into the scripture and they they
[30:56] begin to study these things you know
[30:57] they want everything but tied up in a
[30:59] pretty little bow and they want
[31:00] everything with all of the t's crossed
[31:03] and all the eyes dotted but you know
[31:05] brother scissors that's not the way it
[31:06] is
[31:07] why because you've got to take it by
[31:09] faith
[31:11] i mean when god comes and he begins to
[31:13] reveal things to you and you catch
[31:15] something by revelation but you know
[31:16] that's not going to take you all away
[31:23] well we have to walk by faith
[31:29] so we just continue to walk by walk by
[31:32] faith
[31:36] we can't
[31:38] just
[31:40] hold
[31:44] hold our own feelings our own thoughts
[31:49] you know there's many people in the
[31:50] scripture you know they they begin to
[31:52] hold on to those you know those things
[31:54] where they where they they it doesn't
[31:57] answer all of the questions but you know
[31:59] something began to be revealed to them
[32:04] as we were reading here in the in the
[32:07] scripture in luke
[32:08] you know here's simeon
[32:11] you know here's here's a devout man a
[32:13] just man here's a here's a man that that
[32:15] had walked before the lord all these
[32:17] years and and and and had a great
[32:20] reputation you know many people no doubt
[32:23] loved him and reverenced him but you
[32:24] know god began to speak to him and tell
[32:27] him
[32:30] because you know he held on to these
[32:32] things
[32:33] and was looking for it
[32:36] looking for the coming of the lord to
[32:38] fulfillment of the word
[32:41] it hadn't become dull even even in his
[32:44] old age and and all these things he
[32:46] still held on to the scripture what did
[32:48] what it had said
[32:50] it still meant something to him and even
[32:53] as he got older and all the problems
[32:54] that he had he still was holding on to
[32:56] the scripture that it would be fulfilled
[32:59] and it says the holy ghost came to him
[33:02] and and spoke to him and told him said
[33:04] listen you'll not pass away until this
[33:06] that you desire to see will take place
[33:09] he says you're not going to pass away
[33:10] until you see the lord's christ
[33:14] well you know no no doubt there was a
[33:15] lot of people that walked out there and
[33:17] thought well you know he's just getting
[33:18] old he's just beside himself but you
[33:21] know what he didn't change simeon
[33:23] he held on to that and he still began no
[33:25] matter what anybody said it didn't
[33:27] change who you know it didn't change his
[33:29] idea he didn't why because if he was a a
[33:32] man of god and had heard god speak
[33:34] before then he had already heard that
[33:36] and you know what he held on to that he
[33:38] didn't listen to the naysayers or
[33:40] anybody else or anybody else trying to
[33:42] talk him out of it do you really think
[33:44] that it's going to be in your lifetime
[33:46] seeming that this is going to take place
[33:48] he said well you know all i can do is
[33:50] tell you what god told me
[33:53] and i'm just going to hold on to it why
[33:55] because i i believe what he said but you
[33:58] know he's obligated to fulfill the word
[34:00] all i got to do is believe it if he
[34:02] spoke to me that's all i have to do is
[34:04] hold on to it i can't i can't uh you
[34:07] know figure out all the x's and o's and
[34:09] all the other other things all i got to
[34:11] do is believe it all i got to do is hold
[34:13] on to it
[34:15] and he began to testify to the people
[34:17] and and no doubt there was a lot of
[34:18] people that thought he was losing his
[34:20] mind
[34:21] but he still held on to what god told
[34:23] him
[34:26] and as he began to speak then you know
[34:28] that as the scripture tells us there
[34:30] when when mary and joseph brought jesus
[34:32] into the temple to fulfill the law
[34:36] god was working on the other end and he
[34:39] reached out and told simeon he said
[34:40] listen he said the fulfillment of this
[34:42] word
[34:43] the fulfillment of your desire is here
[34:46] in the temple
[34:48] and you know
[34:49] he being led by the spirit of god no
[34:51] doubt had held on to this and then the
[34:53] spirit of god led him to where the child
[34:56] was and he was able to pick up jesus in
[34:58] his in his arms and look upon this
[35:00] little child
[35:08] and then he says
[35:11] he said lord now let us thou thy servant
[35:14] depart in peace according to thy word
[35:16] for mine eyes have seen thy salvation
[35:19] which thou has prepared before the face
[35:22] of all people
[35:24] a light to lighten the gentiles and the
[35:26] glory of thy people israel
[35:30] and so and it says and joseph and his
[35:32] mother marveled at these things that
[35:33] were spoken
[35:36] you know no doubt they were holding on
[35:38] to
[35:39] you know having having to walk by faith
[35:41] and believe something that was just you
[35:43] know a miracle and and nobody else
[35:46] believing it and and you know had
[35:48] dealing with the ridicule and all the
[35:50] things that they had to face and yet
[35:52] they still held on to that word and then
[35:54] you know when they walk into the temple
[35:56] and here's simeon begin to speak upon
[35:59] the same thing that they knew
[36:02] there was a revelation to simeon that
[36:04] the same thing that they held on he
[36:06] began to identify the same thing
[36:09] and you know it marveled they were
[36:10] marveled by these things and he said
[36:15] and simeon blessed them and said unto
[36:16] mary his mother behold this child is set
[36:19] for the fall and rising again of many in
[36:21] israel and for a sign which shall be
[36:23] spoken against
[36:26] and when we go back into the scripture
[36:28] we know that he said it as a set for a
[36:30] fall why because he would be a stumbling
[36:32] stone
[36:34] he would be a rock of offense
[36:37] but you know there was a rock a
[36:38] revelation that people would be built
[36:40] upon that they would hold on to but he
[36:42] would also be for the falling away of
[36:44] people
[36:48] and a sign which shall be spoken against
[36:52] why because the sign that would come it
[36:54] would be just like every other prophet
[36:58] being the prophet of the prophets it
[37:00] would be the same thing as it was back
[37:02] then why because they they ridiculed the
[37:05] prophets they killed them they stoned
[37:07] them all the things that happened to the
[37:08] prophets
[37:14] that he would be spoken against
[37:19] he said that the thoughts of many hearts
[37:21] may be revealed
[37:24] so we know that that he would come and
[37:25] he would he would make himself known
[37:28] and he would reveal the secrets of the
[37:30] pro of the hearts of the people
[37:34] as he as he began to do the the feeling
[37:37] of fulfilling the scriptures that was
[37:39] spoken of him
[37:42] and and continuing on here verse 36 of
[37:46] the same chapter
[37:48] it says and there was one anna a
[37:49] prophetess the daughter of fannie old
[37:53] of the tribe of astr and she was of
[37:55] great age and had lived with a husband
[37:56] seven years from her virginity and she
[37:59] was was a widow about four score in four
[38:02] years which departed not from the temple
[38:04] but served god with fastings and prayers
[38:07] night and day and she coming in that
[38:09] instant gave thanks likewise unto god
[38:12] and spake of of him to
[38:14] all them that look for redemption in
[38:17] jerusalem
[38:18] and when they had performed all things
[38:20] according to the law of the lord they
[38:22] returned to galilee to their own city
[38:25] nazareth
[38:27] so we see that anna had also
[38:30] been moved by the spirit to speak
[38:34] and declaring the same thing that had
[38:36] that simeon had spoken of in the same
[38:39] time
[38:41] and may you know and it was just a it
[38:43] was a double confirmation of what mary
[38:46] and joseph had had had
[38:48] happened in their life what they had
[38:50] experienced and here it was when the
[38:52] fulfillment of the word fulfilling of
[38:54] the law came then they began to fulfill
[38:57] and begin to proclaim to them the same
[39:00] thing as a confirmation of what they had
[39:02] stood for what they had believed
[39:08] and the scripture says verse 40 says and
[39:10] the child grew and whacked strong in
[39:12] spirit filled with wisdom and the grace
[39:14] of god was upon him
[39:17] now his parents went to jerusalem every
[39:19] year at the feast of the passover
[39:22] and when he was 12 years old
[39:25] they went up to jerusalem after the
[39:27] custom of the feast
[39:29] and when they had fulfilled the days
[39:31] as they returned the child jesus carried
[39:34] behind in jerusalem and joseph and his
[39:37] mother knew not of it
[39:39] and they supposing him
[39:42] to have been in the company when a day's
[39:45] journey
[39:46] and they sought him among their kin
[39:48] folks and acquaintance
[39:53] and they came and when they found him
[39:55] not they turned back again to jerusalem
[39:57] seeking him and it came to pass that
[39:59] after three days they found him in the
[40:01] temple sitting in the midst of the
[40:03] doctors both hearing them and asking
[40:06] them questions
[40:08] and all that heard him were astonished
[40:10] at his understanding and answers and
[40:12] when they saw him they were amazed and
[40:14] his mother said unto him son
[40:16] why hast thou
[40:18] thus dealt with us behold thy father and
[40:20] i have sought thee sorrowing and he had
[40:23] said un and he said unto them how is it
[40:26] that he sought me wishing not that i
[40:29] must be about my father's business and
[40:31] they understood not
[40:33] the saying which he spake unto them
[40:35] but he went down with them and came to
[40:37] nazareth and was subject unto them but
[40:39] his mother kept all these things in a
[40:42] heart and jesus increased in wisdom and
[40:43] stature and in favor with god and man
[40:49] and
[40:51] so we we know with as as they came that
[40:54] you know as as
[40:56] mary and joseph had had this great
[40:58] experience took place in the temple that
[41:01] day and and simeon began to you know
[41:05] i don't know how many people you know
[41:07] but we know that he proclaimed his you
[41:10] know his his uh testimony and made it
[41:12] known that that he was going this was
[41:14] going to take place
[41:16] and no doubt that that anna being a
[41:18] prophetess being in the temple
[41:21] then that she had made no no no doubt
[41:23] she had uh scriptural experiences and
[41:26] and and the different things that
[41:28] happened that she knew what was and had
[41:30] prophesied different things to the
[41:32] people that that people knew who she was
[41:34] that she wasn't just some quiet but god
[41:36] had spoke through her
[41:40] and as they took these things away and
[41:42] yet when the scripture tells us that
[41:44] they went to the went to the feast every
[41:46] year
[41:50] and here they go into the at the
[41:52] passover and here they they go into into
[41:54] the city and they and they go and and
[41:56] and do and do the customs and everything
[41:59] but then all of a sudden you know then
[42:00] they they don't pay attention to where
[42:02] jesus is
[42:05] but you know the first thing jesus they
[42:07] find jesus jesus is in their time in the
[42:09] temple talking to the doctors
[42:12] discussing the word why because he was
[42:15] the word and then he's out there
[42:16] discussing the word with the people but
[42:18] you know they became likes about what
[42:20] was taking place and then all of a
[42:22] sudden they left without him
[42:25] and as and as they you know they were
[42:27] gone and then they decided to come back
[42:29] but the first thing that that that mary
[42:32] says when she comes back into the temple
[42:35] and sees him you know why did you do
[42:37] this
[42:39] why why why have you treated us this way
[42:44] well you know what jesus was exactly
[42:46] where he was supposed to be
[42:49] i mean they were the ones they were the
[42:51] ones that didn't keep up with him
[42:53] they were not the ones that was
[42:55] following to find out what was going on
[42:56] but you know they left
[43:00] but she's asking you know why did you
[43:02] treat me this way
[43:05] you know the thing is is it you know
[43:07] when it comes to whether one you know
[43:09] when you wonder what happens in your
[43:11] life and wonder why things have happened
[43:12] and why things go the way that they do
[43:14] you know the one thing we got to do is
[43:16] stop and realize you know god ain't the
[43:18] one that left
[43:20] god didn't move
[43:23] when things go cold and there's lots of
[43:25] problems in our lives many times when we
[43:27] look you know the problem is it's us
[43:29] we've gotten away from god
[43:32] why because we allow god to be put on a
[43:34] back burner we allow god to be put off
[43:36] to the side we fail to we fail to keep
[43:38] him close by and i keep our eyes on him
[43:42] and all of a sudden he's gone and they
[43:44] wonder why why what's happened and why
[43:46] have you treated me this way
[43:49] well he didn't change
[43:54] no they were
[43:55] excuse me they were the ones that left
[43:58] and she comes into the temple and the
[43:59] first thing that she says is your father
[44:02] and i have have salty with tears you
[44:05] know we're so brokenhearted so worried
[44:07] about you that we've been traveling back
[44:09] to get you
[44:10] you know why did you treat me this way
[44:13] and the first thing he says you know
[44:17] don't you realize i must be about my
[44:19] father's business
[44:22] here here i'm doing i'm doing exactly
[44:24] what i'm supposed to do
[44:28] you know and you know as the scripture
[44:31] says that you know they were astonished
[44:33] by
[44:34] his understanding and everything but you
[44:36] know
[44:37] here she was wondering about him and and
[44:39] the first time that she begins to speak
[44:42] after all this time that she walks in
[44:44] there and you know he had to rebuke her
[44:46] because of her answer because of what
[44:48] over testimonies you know and here he
[44:51] said you know and then she's the first
[44:52] one that comes up there and says as the
[44:54] scripture tells us that he would be a
[44:57] sign that would be spoken against and
[44:58] she was the one that walks into the
[45:00] temple and declares that joseph was the
[45:02] father
[45:06] here he was beginning by her own
[45:08] testimony but you know he you know he as
[45:10] brother brown said you know if if joseph
[45:12] had been his father he'd been in the
[45:14] carpenter's shop but he was not even god
[45:17] was his father he was in the temple with
[45:18] the word
[45:20] declaring the word
[45:23] but you know nonetheless he was subject
[45:25] to his parents and he went with them
[45:29] and so here we see that he would always
[45:31] be uh there was a sign that would be
[45:33] spoken against
[45:40] we'd say all the way through the
[45:41] scripture that
[45:42] many times when we begin to
[45:45] look at the scriptures
[45:50] people began to look
[45:55] but they didn't they didn't hold on to
[45:57] the word
[46:01] you know but and so as as as the
[46:03] scriptures went forth
[46:06] you know there's so many of them that
[46:08] you know that began to speak and when
[46:10] jesus began to speak and and go about
[46:12] and as the scripture tells us that he
[46:14] went out and to do good and to and to
[46:16] heal the sick and and to fulfill the the
[46:19] word
[46:20] and then the people walked out there and
[46:22] they said
[46:23] is this not the carpenter's son
[46:28] you know and it's it's not not seeing
[46:30] that it was the fulfillment of the word
[46:33] but the first thing they do is like
[46:36] well don't we know his mom and daddy
[46:40] and here and here he is out doing
[46:42] miracles
[46:44] and declaring the word to the people and
[46:46] the first thing that they say is like
[46:50] don't his mama got a bad reputation
[46:55] you know i think i think they said that
[46:57] his mom and daddy
[46:59] trying to pass off that he he's virgin
[47:01] born
[47:07] and when he began to point them
[47:09] back to the scripture when he began to
[47:11] declare the word the first thing that
[47:13] people could do is look back at his past
[47:15] and say
[47:21] was he born in bethlehem
[47:25] i don't remember him being born in
[47:26] bethlehem do you remember that
[47:30] you know then every time all it was it
[47:32] wasn't what jesus said to the people
[47:35] but it was it was it was always that
[47:37] accusation that could be made
[47:39] it was always the whispers behind his
[47:42] back
[47:43] that people began to say and it's like
[47:45] you know then they become to stir these
[47:46] questions up in people's minds
[47:50] that as they begin to see these things
[47:52] and and you know then
[47:54] you know when when they begin to
[47:56] question when the when the pharisees and
[47:58] the different ones begin to question him
[48:00] on the on the different things of this
[48:02] of the word and and then they would ask
[48:04] him questions and and you know then he
[48:06] would then he would begin to ask them
[48:08] ques you know as like when they they
[48:10] asked him you know it was john's baptism
[48:11] was it of man or was it of god
[48:15] you know they didn't want to answer his
[48:17] question why because they feared the
[48:19] people
[48:20] but they didn't they didn't believe what
[48:21] john had to say
[48:24] and he began to point them back to the
[48:25] scripture and say well this is this is
[48:27] if this is true then then why didn't you
[48:30] follow it
[48:32] and then when he began to bring him back
[48:34] to the word and point out to him and
[48:36] then they were like well nobody no man
[48:38] could answer him
[48:40] nobody nobody wanted to answer him
[48:44] why because they wanted to hold on to
[48:46] their own denominational ideas
[48:50] when when when nicodemus come to him at
[48:52] night that and you know began to speak
[48:54] to him and said he said rabbi listen
[48:59] he said we know that thou art a teacher
[49:01] come from god and no man can do these
[49:03] things unless god was with him
[49:07] but nicodemus didn't want to come during
[49:09] the day
[49:11] nicodemus didn't want to come where
[49:12] everybody could see him
[49:14] he wanted to sneak around in the middle
[49:16] of the night
[49:18] and come talk to jesus so nobody else
[49:20] had to see what he what he had to say
[49:23] why because you know he didn't he didn't
[49:25] want to give up his prestige or it might
[49:27] you know that he would have to answer
[49:29] why was he out talking to jesus
[49:36] why would he talk you know why why would
[49:38] he want to know these things
[49:41] but there was something that intrigued
[49:43] him that stirred up inside him that he
[49:45] would come to ask jesus these questions
[49:47] and then when jesus began to speak to
[49:50] him and he would tell him he said listen
[49:53] he said except a man be born again he
[49:55] cannot see the kingdom of god
[49:58] and when he began to speak these things
[50:01] you know then nicodemus was there and
[50:02] he's like well how can i enter back into
[50:04] my mother
[50:06] and he said listen he said he said it's
[50:08] not being born by the flesh again he
[50:11] said but you must be born of the spirit
[50:15] he said except a man be born of water
[50:17] and a spirit he cannot enter into the
[50:19] kingdom of god
[50:21] and he began to speak to these things
[50:23] and here here's a great learned man of
[50:26] the day and here he is and he didn't
[50:28] even understand the things that jesus
[50:29] had to say
[50:31] and he began jesus began to point him
[50:33] back to these things and yet he never
[50:35] did he never did follow in them
[50:38] but he did you know he held on for a
[50:40] little while but he didn't he didn't
[50:41] continue in it
[50:45] and all the way through the scripture we
[50:46] see them as they begin to speak
[50:50] as he began to speak to the different
[50:52] ones all through the to the to the
[50:54] people
[50:57] you know he said he said he spoke to the
[50:59] to the common people and they heard him
[51:01] gladly
[51:03] you know as the man that was blind there
[51:06] that day the young man that was blind
[51:07] and he stood there and you know and you
[51:09] know his parents were asking you know
[51:12] you know
[51:13] how did this this man this young man
[51:16] receive his sight
[51:18] and they were so afraid of answering the
[51:20] question you know it's like well he's of
[51:22] age you ask him i'm not we're not
[51:23] getting involved in this
[51:27] what do you well do you know how long
[51:29] your son was blind do you know that if
[51:31] it was really a true thing
[51:34] and then the young man walks up there
[51:35] and they were asking about you know how
[51:37] did this take place and who held you and
[51:39] all these things
[51:41] i know he could testify was this and i
[51:43] was blind
[51:44] i know what it's like to be blind
[51:47] but you know what there was one that
[51:48] came and told me that he could that he
[51:50] could recover my sight that i could see
[51:52] and he said all i had to do was believe
[51:54] what he had to say and do what he said
[51:56] do and i received my sight
[51:59] and you know there was something all of
[52:00] a sudden this man he stepped up and said
[52:02] you know i follow this man
[52:05] why because because all of them back in
[52:07] the old testament y'all said kept
[52:08] telling me that jehovah could fulfill
[52:10] these things
[52:12] he could he could fulfill he could feel
[52:14] and touch people and heal people
[52:18] the the psalmist david told us that we
[52:20] had one that that could touch they could
[52:23] heal all our diseases
[52:26] he could he could do all these mighty
[52:28] miracles we've heard all these things in
[52:30] the scripture and yet here's one that
[52:32] stands in our minds and does the
[52:33] miracles
[52:35] and begins to do these things he said he
[52:37] said do y'all want to follow him also
[52:40] oh oh forbidden
[52:43] oh heaven forbid that we have anything
[52:45] to do with this man
[52:48] this man's bells above
[52:54] anybody in the right mind would know
[52:55] this man had a devil and why would
[52:57] anybody want to have anything to do with
[52:59] him
[53:03] yet there was jesus standing there and
[53:05] said listen
[53:06] he said if j if the devil can cast out
[53:08] if satan can cast out satan and his
[53:10] house is divided his kingdom's divided
[53:15] he said he said this this is not it but
[53:19] he said but look
[53:21] he said it was it was what was spoken of
[53:23] in the scripture that these things would
[53:25] take place
[53:27] but yet and even no matter all that was
[53:29] said and done
[53:31] yet they did not believe it
[53:33] they did not hold to it
[53:36] why because it was they were the ones
[53:37] that would not hold on to it it was it
[53:40] was this um
[53:43] fulfillment
[53:44] of the word
[53:46] that they held on to their
[53:47] denominational ideas and here they are
[53:49] holding on to what god had had clearly
[53:53] vindicated to the people and yet they
[53:55] still turned it down and walked away
[54:00] and many times you know
[54:02] we see that the time and the age in
[54:04] which we we live
[54:08] we know that that that time and and see
[54:12] all these things would
[54:13] would repeat themselves again
[54:16] and we know that uh as we we've seen the
[54:18] day and the hour that we live that you
[54:20] know god is still doing the exact same
[54:22] thing that he's always done
[54:24] what was prophesied in the scripture
[54:26] that he would do these things
[54:33] and yet
[54:34] there would still be those
[54:36] that would not believe
[54:38] and no matter how much how much the word
[54:40] was made known and revealed they still
[54:43] would not believe it
[54:45] but there's only but there is a
[54:47] predestinated group that would believe
[54:54] and this is from the message
[54:58] what was the holy ghost given for
[55:01] brethren says there's only one way to
[55:03] find it
[55:05] he said there was a stone cut out of the
[55:07] mountain without hands that rolled into
[55:09] the world and smashed it out
[55:11] and it became like weed or chaff on the
[55:13] threshing floors
[55:15] he said let that stone the christ jesus
[55:17] that stumbling stone to the world a
[55:20] stone of a fence a laughing stone a
[55:22] stumbling block to the church but a
[55:24] precious and a lodestone to the believer
[55:28] a stone of assurance a stone of rest oh
[55:30] my resting i know that i've passed from
[55:33] death unto life my soul is at rest oh
[55:37] come unto me all you that labor and
[55:40] heavy laden and i'll give you rest for
[55:41] your soul
[55:42] a sign that's to be evil spoken of said
[55:46] the prophet to the prophet to mary it'll
[55:48] be a sign sure it will but it'll be an
[55:51] assurance it'll be a love it'll be a
[55:54] satisfaction it'll be something that you
[55:56] know you've passed from death unto life
[56:01] jehovah god became man took on our stock
[56:05] crossed himself from god and become man
[56:08] there's the sign
[56:11] become he was god and became man not
[56:14] rich men but poor man this is the super
[56:16] sign you've asked for a sign said god
[56:19] i'll give you one an everlasting son
[56:21] he could have come otherwise
[56:24] as i said but a baby why did he become a
[56:27] baby
[56:28] when that first little toothless mouth
[56:30] opened in that manger on the first
[56:33] cr the first christmas morning
[56:36] in his little manger from god and was
[56:38] man ever wit man come to the world with
[56:40] nothing but still man what was
[56:43] he trying to do what was he purposing
[56:46] he cried like a baby in the manger he
[56:48] played like a little boy on the street
[56:49] he told like a man but yet he was
[56:52] emmanuel this is the super side god
[56:54] dwelling in the creation that he created
[56:57] this super sign
[56:58] shall be
[57:00] a sign
[57:01] unto you
[57:07] brother brown
[57:09] continuing dropping down to 60
[57:12] scrolling down to 68 there he said can't
[57:15] you see the real sinus jehovah
[57:17] become one of us jehovah god on earth as
[57:20] a fugitive a pilgrim in the land that he
[57:22] created rejected and pushed and laughed
[57:25] at and scoffed at a stumbling stone to
[57:27] the unbeliever a rock of offense a devil
[57:30] to the religious world but an eternal
[57:33] sign of the believer god with us the
[57:34] super son did you see it
[57:36] god made manifest god presenting himself
[57:39] to the world as a fugitive
[57:41] could have come some other way but chose
[57:43] to come this way
[57:45] listen to this don't miss it i think
[57:47] that god had his
[57:49] head in his mind he it would be
[57:51] appealing to the human being
[57:54] it is to the believer it is appealing
[57:56] when god became
[57:58] becomes one of us but to the starchy
[58:00] ungodly a stumbling block i'll give you
[58:03] the son a virgin shall conceive emmanuel
[58:06] will be with you god thought it would
[58:08] appeal to the human race that our god
[58:10] would be one of us that he would cross
[58:13] himself and become our dust that
[58:17] he
[58:18] would become our stock a human stock the
[58:20] creator who made all things and again it
[58:23] fulfilling prophecies
[58:25] the prophets
[58:27] had saw it
[58:30] he said another thing and the world was
[58:32] and the word was made flesh
[58:34] made dust flesh and dwelt among us the
[58:36] jehovah the word
[58:38] became human became dust and tabernacled
[58:40] with us everlasting fl sign
[58:43] shall never end oh when we think of it
[58:45] an eternal sign the super signs of all
[58:48] sign god becoming one of us
[58:51] and then
[58:52] he must be the seed of abraham abraham
[58:55] of course was the seed of eve he was the
[58:58] woman's seed that was to bruise the
[59:00] serpent's head but abraham if you catch
[59:02] it he had faith in god which re which
[59:05] united the spirit of god with the flesh
[59:07] of man there's where the faith come
[59:10] there's why
[59:12] he could be the abraham seed not all
[59:15] flesh but the uniting of spirit and
[59:17] flesh together god
[59:19] making himself tearing out rooting out
[59:21] all evil bringing into submission the
[59:23] flesh the dust that he created
[59:27] and live with you as a partner
[59:31] amen
[59:35] so
[59:37] here becomes that sign
[59:41] that everybody that was rejected as he
[59:43] said that they would be spoken of but
[59:45] yet he came
[59:46] to fulfill the word
[59:49] that he become one of us
[59:51] that we could become him
[59:53] he took he took on our flesh
[59:55] he took on our substance
[59:58] he became he became sin
[1:00:02] who knew no sin
[1:00:03] that we become the righteousness of god
[1:00:06] and here he be coming and he said he
[1:00:08] said this would be a sign
[1:00:11] an everlasting sign that he would come
[1:00:13] and he would become one of us and he
[1:00:15] would told just like we did and he would
[1:00:17] face all of the things that we faced but
[1:00:19] yet he would he would do it without sin
[1:00:22] and he would overcome
[1:00:24] and then when in the end then he would
[1:00:25] stand up and he would say listen i've
[1:00:27] conquered all of this
[1:00:29] he said he said you know he's i've come
[1:00:31] into the world and he said i've
[1:00:32] conquered he said now you're able to
[1:00:34] conquer through me
[1:00:36] he said he said all that that i have is
[1:00:39] given unto you and so now the same as
[1:00:42] being an heir of god and joint heirs
[1:00:44] with christ then all of these things and
[1:00:46] then as as they began to look through
[1:00:48] the through the scripture then all of a
[1:00:51] sudden then he became what we are that
[1:00:53] we become what he is
[1:00:57] and we still stand today
[1:01:00] and the fulfillment of the word it's
[1:01:04] today
[1:01:07] why because today and the day an hour
[1:01:10] which we live while we become why
[1:01:12] because as all the way down through the
[1:01:14] through the scriptures we realize that
[1:01:17] well in our day we've received a prophet
[1:01:20] why because god never never has left his
[1:01:23] word but he became in our day to reveal
[1:01:26] the word just like he did back then and
[1:01:29] to make it known to the people
[1:01:31] to make it known to you and i
[1:01:34] yeah we you know and yet and all of that
[1:01:37] that was spoken of yet there would be
[1:01:39] people that would come and and ridicule
[1:01:41] it
[1:01:42] and they would stand against it and you
[1:01:45] know ask all these questions and say you
[1:01:47] know why does it say this and why does
[1:01:49] it say that and you can't you can't
[1:01:50] defend this and why why don't we have
[1:01:53] all these different questions and all
[1:01:54] these things and all they do is get up
[1:01:56] and ridicule and discount the word why
[1:01:58] because it was spoken of that it would
[1:02:00] take place but yet there would be some
[1:02:03] that would stand up that god would speak
[1:02:05] to and they would receive a revelation
[1:02:08] god god didn't call us to you know to be
[1:02:11] apologetics
[1:02:13] but god called us to proclaim the truth
[1:02:16] i can't you know you may not be able to
[1:02:18] answer all the questions i can't answer
[1:02:20] all of the questions but you know let me
[1:02:21] tell you something i know what god has
[1:02:23] revealed to me and i can stand on that
[1:02:27] i stand on what god has showed me and i
[1:02:29] stand on that and yes you know what
[1:02:32] every time that someone has stood up
[1:02:34] even back then even when jesus stood and
[1:02:37] walked in the word that he was spoke of
[1:02:39] he was made fun of and ridiculed and
[1:02:41] scorned and you know what we still have
[1:02:43] that same testimony today that we still
[1:02:46] stand up and take the reproach of the
[1:02:48] word that we still have to be
[1:02:52] having to stand and proclaim the same
[1:02:54] thing
[1:02:57] the world the world doesn't like us the
[1:02:59] world has come well because he didn't
[1:03:01] they didn't they didn't like him they
[1:03:03] they stood against him
[1:03:06] he was outcast of the world and we are
[1:03:08] outcasts of the world
[1:03:11] but you know we have we have received
[1:03:12] this word
[1:03:14] and it's going to be evil spoken against
[1:03:17] but you know what it's a great thing
[1:03:18] because you know it was it's a great
[1:03:20] thing to us why because it's a great
[1:03:22] thing to me why because the word has
[1:03:24] made has been made known
[1:03:28] one because when when we pick up the
[1:03:30] scripture it's it's not well you know i
[1:03:33] i don't know how how that that puts you
[1:03:36] know how we put that together and
[1:03:37] everything
[1:03:39] because when when the prophet came and
[1:03:42] we've seen that in the day in which in
[1:03:44] which we've lived and then
[1:03:46] many people have probed at it and there
[1:03:48] was so many i mean great scholarly men
[1:03:51] have looked into this word and and have
[1:03:53] studied the scriptures and all these
[1:03:55] things and yet it takes it takes god
[1:03:57] using a man that had that he had uh
[1:04:01] prophesied that would come that he
[1:04:03] ordained that would come in the last
[1:04:05] days that would take this word and it
[1:04:06] would open up and it would be made known
[1:04:09] and he began to reveal the scriptures to
[1:04:11] the people
[1:04:12] and you have to get into all of that and
[1:04:14] all of the great
[1:04:16] understanding that has been made known
[1:04:18] then people have turned it down why
[1:04:20] because he didn't they're fancy it
[1:04:22] didn't match it didn't match their
[1:04:23] denominational ideas and then you know
[1:04:26] there's all these different ideas and
[1:04:29] different camps and all these things but
[1:04:30] yet there's still a voice being cried
[1:04:33] out that is still speaking the truth and
[1:04:35] there's still people that still have the
[1:04:37] ears to hear
[1:04:43] excuse me
[1:04:45] i thank god for the day in which hour
[1:04:47] which we live
[1:04:50] god's called us
[1:04:52] to proclaim this word to carry the
[1:04:54] reproach of it
[1:04:59] that's that's our that's what god has
[1:05:01] called us
[1:05:05] but you know it's it's not it's not
[1:05:06] whether you understand it all
[1:05:11] and there's people you know that still
[1:05:12] they they they have
[1:05:14] gotten that's that's all they do is they
[1:05:17] they find things to ridicule and and
[1:05:19] things that that don't match up and and
[1:05:22] all this and they just feed on that
[1:05:27] but you know what
[1:05:28] i'm not i'm not worried about all the
[1:05:29] things that i don't understand
[1:05:33] i'm walking on the things that i do
[1:05:34] understand
[1:05:36] i'm walking on the i'm walking into
[1:05:37] things that god has showed me that has
[1:05:39] made that god has made known to me
[1:05:41] that's what i'm rejoicing in amen
[1:05:45] i i want to thank god because all of
[1:05:48] these things even you know even when we
[1:05:50] look at the the life and the christian
[1:05:52] life well you know to be like jesus to
[1:05:54] see the things that jesus had to go
[1:05:57] through
[1:05:59] and all the things that he had to suffer
[1:06:03] and the scripture
[1:06:04] as the song brother i'm talking about
[1:06:07] he said must jesus bear the cross along
[1:06:11] and all the world go free
[1:06:15] he said no
[1:06:18] there's a cross for me
[1:06:22] there's a cross for me to carry
[1:06:26] and i want to carry mine gladly
[1:06:30] i want to be faithful in what god has
[1:06:33] called me to
[1:06:37] you know we can we see all the things
[1:06:38] that have taken place but you know
[1:06:41] the the the scorn and the and the
[1:06:43] ridicule
[1:06:45] and all those things
[1:06:48] you know that comes with it but you know
[1:06:50] i'm not i'm not looking
[1:06:53] at what goes on down here on this earth
[1:06:56] i'm not looking at these things
[1:06:58] i'm looking for an eternal home
[1:07:01] i'm looking for what the end result's
[1:07:04] going to be
[1:07:10] and you know
[1:07:13] you know
[1:07:15] all the way through the
[1:07:16] the history we you go back and looking
[1:07:18] to see what the different ones had to
[1:07:23] the price that each one had to pay
[1:07:29] you know we go back and you start to
[1:07:31] look and see that all the ones that gave
[1:07:33] their lives
[1:07:34] for this word
[1:07:38] you know
[1:07:40] it may not it may not be a physical
[1:07:43] taking of our life
[1:07:46] but it's a giving of our life to god
[1:07:49] it's a surrendering
[1:07:51] of all things to him
[1:07:54] you know we have a lot of people that
[1:07:58] that have
[1:08:01] have to have to face a lot of heartaches
[1:08:04] and problems

[1:08:07] looking at
[1:08:09] what goes on down here i'm looking for
[1:08:10] that eternal weight of glory
