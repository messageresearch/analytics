[1:06] and we fed them they come out yeah
[1:10] very much
[1:11] all right before we get started who all
[1:13] looked up well you don't have to raise
[1:14] your hand you're supposed to look up
[1:15] justification and sanctification the uh
[1:20] homework
[1:23] if you didn't shame on you reach over
[1:24] and take this hand if you're
[1:25] right-handed put it down like this take
[1:27] this hand and go
[1:32] thank you all a lot but if i'd have told
[1:33] y'all you need to been at the doctor and
[1:35] and get a prescription how many of you
[1:37] would have went every one of these
[1:45] so for those of you that did and those
[1:47] of you who didn't
[1:48] i'm going to read kathy's
[1:50] i'm going to
[1:51] use mine or read what sister kathy's got
[1:53] cause she wrote it with her own writing
[1:55] and wrote it by hand
[1:57] he didn't cheat on the computer and then
[1:59] hit prince
[2:03] print look on the internet
[2:18] okay
[2:32] no i didn't but it's just commendable
[2:35] that sister kathy did okay
[2:37] and i'm sure she didn't copy it brown on
[2:39] your nose kathy
[2:46] you want to come sit up here
[2:57] all right let's read kathy's and let's
[2:58] see what because i wanted you to realize
[3:01] what we were talking about in the seals
[3:02] the first seal and second seal being a
[3:04] type of justification and sanctification
[3:08] justification a forensic term
[3:12] i hope you spelled these right
[3:15] opposed to condemnation
[3:18] as regards its nature it is the
[3:24] just
[3:25] just just the
[3:27] file act of god
[3:30] by which he pardons all the sins of
[3:32] those who be
[3:34] loved in christ
[3:36] and accounts accepts and treats them as
[3:38] righteous
[3:42] as righteous
[3:44] as in the
[3:46] eye of the law
[3:48] in other words as conformed to all its
[3:50] demands
[3:56] she's not telling anybody you go search
[3:57] it for yourself she said
[4:05] in addition to the pardon of sins
[4:07] justification declares that all the
[4:10] claims of the law are satisfied
[4:14] in respect that's why i like to i like
[4:16] to read this
[4:17] listen in addition
[4:19] all right conform to all these commands
[4:21] that's justification justified
[4:23] in addition to the pardon of sin
[4:26] justification declares that all the
[4:28] claims of the law are satisfied
[4:31] in respect of the justified
[4:34] is the act of a judge and not of a
[4:36] sovereign the law is not relaxed or set
[4:39] aside
[4:40] but is declared to be fulfilled in the
[4:44] strictest sense
[4:45] in other words you sin you're not going
[4:47] to get away with it
[4:48] but if you go by what the law says
[4:52] the will the word of god
[4:53] then
[4:54] that sin is not counted to you
[4:57] all right
[4:58] and so the person's justified is
[5:01] declared to be entitled to all the
[5:03] advantages and rewards
[5:06] arising from perfect obedience to the
[5:08] law
[5:11] we know we're not we know everybody
[5:13] the law is dead
[5:15] as far as do's and don'ts
[5:17] but still it is do's and don'ts
[5:20] it still is dues and though
[5:23] i don't smoke and drink
[5:27] i do serve the lord now so he'll still
[5:29] do to know that's right but this is
[5:31] because you wanted to that's correct
[5:34] right the law in the old testament was
[5:37] that's the way it was just like
[5:39] today our natural law
[5:41] you break that law there's a penalty
[5:44] and this is see this right here is
[5:46] saying the same thing this is not
[5:48] negating that you did it
[5:50] because in baby form in the
[5:52] baby form justification you did do it
[5:56] you know you did it
[5:58] god knows you did it
[6:00] but somehow he put it in the sea of his
[6:02] forgetfulness but we can't
[6:05] we don't have a seed deep enough right
[6:07] right
[6:07] because the devil brings it right back
[6:09] up he goes fishing and digs it up and
[6:11] throws it at us again all right
[6:13] but now listen let me read this one more
[6:14] time
[6:17] because it says right here claims of the
[6:18] law are satisfied in respect of the
[6:20] justified it is the act of a judge and
[6:22] not of a sovereign the law is not
[6:24] relaxed or set aside in other words
[6:28] we got people in the message that says
[6:29] you know we're already in the millennium
[6:30] it doesn't matter if you have two wives
[6:31] or it doesn't matter if you commit
[6:32] adultery it doesn't matter if you do
[6:33] this it don't matter see that that goes
[6:35] to the extreme on this side
[6:38] the law is still there look the old
[6:40] testament laws are still in this book
[6:41] right eternal word of god
[6:44] never to be taken out
[6:46] but remember they were types and shadows
[6:49] of when jesus come
[6:51] right looking back
[6:52] wasn't done away with it sure it was
[6:54] done away with it just like we talked
[6:55] about paul she'd lay not laying again
[6:57] the foundation in other words let's
[6:58] don't go back and try to build the
[6:59] foundation of this church again it's
[7:01] already built
[7:02] let's just build on it
[7:05] well you know let's go this is not going
[7:07] to ever go away
[7:10] it's there right we're going to build on
[7:12] it if we were to build onto this church
[7:14] we wouldn't tear this foundation down
[7:17] we just build on
[7:18] to the foundation all right
[7:21] the law is not relaxed or set aside but
[7:23] it's declared to be fulfilled in the
[7:25] strictest sense in other words stricken
[7:28] from the record
[7:30] and so the person justified is declared
[7:32] to be entitled to all the advantages and
[7:34] rewards arising from perfect obedience
[7:37] to the law it proceeds
[7:40] on the imputing or crediting
[7:42] good grief katie
[7:45] to the believer by god himself of the
[7:48] perfect righteousness
[7:50] active and passive of his representative
[7:52] and surety jesus christ which is romans
[7:54] 10 3 through 9.
[7:57] justification is not the forgiveness of
[7:59] a man without righteousness but a
[8:00] declaration that he possesses a
[8:02] righteousness which perfectly and
[8:04] forever satisfies
[8:06] the law in other words
[8:08] none of us are any good we did it but
[8:10] christ never done it that's right
[8:12] so we look to him as our perpetuation
[8:15] we look to him as our judge jury and
[8:17] prosecutor so we can't lose
[8:20] because there's nothing held against him
[8:22] and if we are in christ there's nothing
[8:23] held against us that's what we have to
[8:25] realize
[8:26] right right
[8:29] that he possesses the righteousness
[8:30] which perfectly and forever satisfies
[8:33] the law namely christ's righteousness
[8:35] the soul condition on which this
[8:37] righteousness is imputed or credited to
[8:39] the believer is faith in
[8:41] the lord jesus christ
[8:44] that's right it all comes back to that
[8:45] simple thing called faith
[8:48] you got to believe that you justified
[8:50] when you come into that first seal you
[8:52] see the first seal
[8:54] white rice's church
[8:56] opposition what righteous church but you
[8:58] have a true white righteous church
[9:00] that's what this is talking about that's
[9:01] right
[9:03] you got to believe
[9:04] that if you've been justified
[9:06] then you've already been glorified
[9:09] you got to believe that
[9:11] regardless of what happens
[9:13] regardless of how many times you think
[9:15] you fall right right i said you think
[9:18] you fall
[9:20] you get back up and go
[9:23] okay
[9:23] because remember it doesn't do away with
[9:25] the law
[9:26] he doesn't do away with the
[9:28] what we're doing no
[9:30] sisters still don't cut the hat sisters
[9:32] still don't wear makeup
[9:34] brothers don't you know lust for women
[9:36] and smoke and drink do all stuff you
[9:37] understand we'll do it anymore
[9:40] don't do it that's right
[9:42] because that's do's and don'ts it is
[9:43] do's and don'ts but it's not do's and
[9:45] don't i do it out of love that's right
[9:48] but i still fall in this old guy right
[9:49] here this is the one that we're trying
[9:51] to destroy is get this guy changed
[9:54] i believe i've had a change on the
[9:56] inside
[9:58] but i need to change on the outside
[10:00] all right
[10:02] not an exchange
[10:04] that old nature's got to die
[10:06] a lot of our problems are is
[10:09] is even in baby form justification
[10:12] it's not it's not completely dead
[10:14] right
[10:15] the old sin is but brother brown said
[10:17] that old nature the man that made you do
[10:20] that is still there
[10:22] right
[10:24] but now when we come to the baptism of
[10:25] the holy ghost and fire
[10:27] clean this man out
[10:29] guess what's going to happen
[10:31] that old nature's dead not divorced we
[10:33] don't believe in divorce
[10:37] we don't believe in divorce
[10:39] we believe in killing right yeah
[10:43] don't take that to the natural sisters
[10:45] and brothers
[10:46] you don't like your husband that doesn't
[10:48] our wife that does not give you the
[10:50] opportunity to kill them
[10:57] but you'd be
[10:58] justified uh that doesn't you're still
[11:00] covered under man's law then
[11:04] okay does everybody get what
[11:05] justification is
[11:08] clean
[11:10] i'm not clean but your sin is forgiven
[11:13] that's all baby form justification is
[11:15] god has done this right here he has made
[11:17] you just
[11:19] as righteous as he is
[11:21] if you continue on
[11:24] but he did forgive your sins from there
[11:26] back now brother brown covers that
[11:28] emphatically
[11:30] your sins from this point backwards is
[11:32] covered right
[11:34] you did them you know you did them
[11:36] a lot of times they're fresh on your
[11:37] mind at that time
[11:39] because remember one week you were doing
[11:41] wrong things and the next week
[11:43] that old desire was going away
[11:45] so you're still looking back though
[11:48] but what is this justification
[11:51] all right let's read this the soul
[11:52] condition on which this righteousness is
[11:54] imputed or credited to the believer it's
[11:56] faith in the lord jesus christ faith is
[11:59] called a condition not because it
[12:00] processes any merit but only because it
[12:03] is the instrument the only instrument by
[12:05] which the soul
[12:07] appreciates
[12:08] or apprehends christ and his
[12:10] righteousness
[12:12] what you're doing is
[12:16] appropriate appropriate sorry i can't
[12:19] read it
[12:22] you've got a beautiful handwriting i
[12:23] just can't read good
[12:24] i got my contact hands down
[12:27] all right so justification what does
[12:28] somebody else got let's see what's good
[12:30] word for words
[12:41] circumstance or explanation that
[12:43] justifies
[12:45] an act of justifying the state of being
[12:47] justified also called justification by
[12:49] faith which is theological the act of
[12:51] god whereby humankind is made
[12:53] are accounted just are free from guilt
[12:55] repentance penalty of sin all right now
[12:58] though let me see the lessons
[13:08] notice all this that you're reading
[13:11] even goes back to
[13:13] it talks about
[13:16] act and
[13:17] and laws
[13:21] it's all got something to do with that
[13:23] even though it doesn't
[13:25] even though it may not say it verbatim
[13:27] in some of these most of these says
[13:28] something about law
[13:32] and when you justified
[13:34] i remember when i become justified i
[13:36] become a lawyer
[13:40] you become very
[13:42] very
[13:43] do's and don'ts at that time why because
[13:45] it's happening to you
[13:47] you're living through it
[13:49] you're the one that's going through and
[13:50] being justified all right because i'm
[13:52] going to read this and then we're going
[13:54] to talk about justification that we
[13:55] talked about in the first season
[13:57] justification is a divine act whereby an
[13:59] infinite god judicially they go back to
[14:02] judge judicially
[14:04] declares a believing sinner to be
[14:06] righteous and acceptable before him
[14:08] because christ has borne the sinner's
[14:10] sin on the cross and has been made unto
[14:12] his righteousness
[14:13] justification springs from the fountain
[14:15] of god's grace which is titus 3 4.
[14:19] it is operative as the result of the
[14:21] redemptive and propitiatory sacrifice of
[14:24] christ who has settled all claims of law
[14:26] so are we righteous
[14:28] no but god's righteous through christ
[14:33] so it's our faith
[14:35] our faith baby faith will you just come
[14:37] to the realization that god i am lost
[14:42] i'm a sinner i did this i did that so
[14:45] you go back to do no i did this i did
[14:46] this i did this i did this i did this
[14:50] and then you go to the altar or you pray
[14:52] or you talk to some christian and and
[14:54] what are they going to do they can point
[14:55] you to christ because there's nobody
[14:56] else we're not all justified
[14:59] to say that hey you're saved you're safe
[15:00] no it's only you and god
[15:02] all right
[15:04] justification is on the basis of faith
[15:06] and not by human merit of words
[15:09] so it wasn't something you got better
[15:13] than you decided to be justified
[15:16] you can't get good enough
[15:19] if you if you think you're good enough
[15:22] the devil got you that's right that's
[15:24] his trap to say that you think you're
[15:27] good enough and you know i know i'm not
[15:28] good enough
[15:30] all right
[15:32] a justified believer emerges from god's
[15:34] great courtroom with a consciousness
[15:36] that another his substitute has borne
[15:38] his guilt and he stands without
[15:39] accusation before the bar of god
[15:42] justification makes no one righteous i
[15:45] like that just what i said
[15:47] justification don't make you righteous
[15:51] neither is the bestowment or of
[15:54] righteousness as such but rather
[15:56] declaring one to be justified whom god
[15:59] sees as as perfected once and forever
[16:02] and his beloved son
[16:04] of course jesus christ right
[16:06] all right so let me read this other one
[16:08] it all has to do with being
[16:10] in a courtroom just justified law
[16:13] court judge jury
[16:16] justification proved to be just right
[16:18] proof
[16:19] when you do in the courtroom you prove
[16:20] something all right
[16:22] to be just right or reasonable
[16:25] dictionary bible announces a
[16:27] favorable verdict
[16:30] i think going back to courtroom
[16:32] favorable verdict
[16:34] declare to be righteous
[16:37] all right so justification
[16:40] you start your rightness with god
[16:43] your past sins are forgiven you start on
[16:45] your road but now what about this
[16:49] white righteous church that we were
[16:51] talking about in the first seal
[16:53] see you should already
[16:55] be at
[16:57] what i call from baby form justification
[16:59] to the second stage of justification
[17:02] that that stuff it's going to bother you
[17:04] don't let me get don't let me put that
[17:06] in your head that that you're just
[17:08] totally a walking
[17:10] um zombie of christ
[17:13] you're not that's right
[17:16] you're going to have the same problems
[17:18] you had at baby form justification
[17:21] this is my this is my quote
[17:24] you're now able to handle it
[17:27] you couldn't handle it at baby form
[17:29] justification because brother brown said
[17:30] if you were justified truly justified
[17:33] you were forgiven of your sins but the
[17:35] center center was still there so you
[17:37] would do it again
[17:40] now see if we come to that point now
[17:42] that's not baby form justification when
[17:43] we come up to justification we're
[17:45] talking about in the seals
[17:47] that person never done it you've got to
[17:49] realize that through the word
[17:51] through the revelation of your own heart
[17:53] not my revelation telling it to you no
[17:56] that's my revelation telling it to you
[17:59] but your revelation in the first seal
[18:01] that there is a white righteous church
[18:04] that never did it to start with
[18:07] never sinned
[18:09] because if there's a big word if if
[18:11] you're born again you didn't
[18:14] the real you
[18:16] the real you did not do that
[18:20] that person is dead
[18:23] and you like many times you see these
[18:25] examples where you know you dad says you
[18:28] go out to a graveyard and accuse his
[18:31] father
[18:32] of stealing two weeks ago well somebody
[18:34] come up and says sam dale stole uh
[18:36] something two weeks ago
[18:38] and then you would call a witness well
[18:42] the first witness would be the family
[18:44] my dad and his brothers and sisters
[18:47] all they'd have to do is walk in the
[18:48] courtroom and say
[18:50] sam dale died 48 years ago
[18:55] the judge will say what
[18:56] see you
[18:58] call the guy brought him in an idiot and
[18:59] probably put him in jail
[19:02] but how did you come up with it well
[19:03] that's what the devil does the same
[19:05] thing
[19:07] he accuses that dead person
[19:10] i've seen it
[19:12] good right
[19:13] just got that just man
[19:18] that dead person
[19:21] satan walks in the courtroom
[19:23] and he says
[19:24] do you see them two weeks ago
[19:27] of course god says
[19:29] that person has been dead forever how
[19:31] long have you been born again that
[19:32] person did how did he do that
[19:36] that's this that's the white
[19:37] righteousness that god's looking for now
[19:40] we're going to fall we're going to make
[19:41] mistakes people
[19:44] but remember the bible says we have an
[19:45] advocate if you have an advocate
[19:48] you need an advocate even after you're
[19:50] born again
[19:51] we need an advocate till this guy's
[19:53] changed
[19:55] and when this guy gets changed we'll
[19:56] know that the advocate's the one that
[19:58] did it
[19:59] it wasn't your mom and daddy and it
[20:01] surely wasn't you
[20:03] but see god's gonna god's gonna take
[20:05] everything that satan does if you're
[20:07] born again
[20:08] he's gonna take everything that satan
[20:10] does
[20:11] and say
[20:13] it's dead
[20:14] how are you gonna accuse the dead man to
[20:16] do something
[20:18] sam dale couldn't have done it he died
[20:19] 48 years ago if somebody did it two
[20:21] weeks ago it wasn't the real
[20:24] sambal right
[20:26] it did
[20:27] okay
[20:28] everybody understand that yes
[20:30] so the next time satan starts into you
[20:33] say hey you talking to a dead man
[20:36] you talking to a dead person
[20:39] dead
[20:40] justified
[20:42] one of them is yes you did it god
[20:44] forgive you
[20:45] okay
[20:46] then it's as if you didn't do it and
[20:48] then the real you didn't do it
[20:50] if you're born again the real you never
[20:52] did it that's right
[20:54] that real you to come in and vulcanized
[20:56] itself to you at the new birth
[21:00] that person is no more like i said it's
[21:02] dead
[21:04] not divorced our problem is is we we
[21:06] think it's dead
[21:08] but it's divorced
[21:10] and divorced
[21:11] some of you that are divorced you know
[21:12] one thing's for sure
[21:15] that old husband our wife is still there
[21:20] and i don't care how good y'all get
[21:21] along and i don't care how good
[21:23] everything goes
[21:24] they steal a sticker in there somewhere
[21:27] right
[21:28] that's why god said
[21:30] you should never do that
[21:32] because he knew us as humans couldn't
[21:34] handle it yeah
[21:35] as humans i'm telling you as humans we
[21:37] all have problems now i've never never
[21:38] been to morse i can't sit up here and
[21:39] say hey i know what you're talking about
[21:41] but i don't but i've seen
[21:42] families get torn apart i've seen
[21:44] families that it seemed like everything
[21:46] was fine and then all of a sudden it's
[21:48] not one person's not dead
[21:51] you got two lives you got living husband
[21:53] and wife and when you do i know all of
[21:56] you that have living husbands and wives
[21:58] there's always that little
[22:01] i don't care how good you get along i
[22:02] don't care if you're both born again
[22:04] if you're both born again you want a
[22:05] divorce
[22:07] born in people do not divorce you
[22:10] okay am i right brother ray i have amen
[22:12] for that they do not
[22:14] brother brown said you are one
[22:17] unless you're born again
[22:18] i told them many times i told them many
[22:20] times
[22:21] the bible doesn't say
[22:23] cleave to your parents and leave your
[22:25] spouse
[22:26] that's right that's what's happening now
[22:30] they're cleaving yeah they're cleaving
[22:31] to their parents and leaving their wife
[22:33] the bible don't say that genesis says
[22:34] you cleave to your wife and leave your
[22:37] parents
[22:39] come back visit bring your grandkids
[22:40] every once in a while but leave
[22:45] clean to your wife and leave your
[22:47] parents
[22:49] could you could you uh type the old
[22:52] testament boss as training a child
[22:55] because with these little ones and so
[22:57] don't do this do that no don't do that
[23:00] and you're trying to teach it how to in
[23:03] the christian sense you're trying to
[23:04] teach it to be christ
[23:06] because that's what the revelation of
[23:09] those commandments is that's right and
[23:11] then when you get old enough as an adult
[23:13] when when the jews when jesus finally
[23:15] came the jews were mature enough that
[23:17] they could make their own decisions to
[23:19] receive him
[23:21] right come to the
[23:23] to the age of accountability
[23:24] that's the same way with you and i he
[23:26] said well the age of accountability is
[23:27] 12 years old no
[23:30] i think there's several forms of the age
[23:32] of accountability
[23:34] because when you become a justified baby
[23:36] in christ
[23:37] god knows you're going to make mistakes
[23:39] because he's not residing in your soul
[23:42] okay
[23:43] so he's going to have those bumps and
[23:45] bruises and
[23:47] and things like that
[23:48] but now also when you become a son of
[23:51] daughter of god son and daughter of god
[23:53] same thing
[23:54] you're still going to have your ups and
[23:56] downs
[23:57] so but god's going to come one day this
[23:59] is the age of accountability right here
[24:01] when you come to the justification that
[24:03] you didn't do it
[24:05] and satan can't bother you he can bother
[24:07] you but he can't get his greasy hands on
[24:10] you
[24:11] that god has truly i believe that that
[24:14] down through the ages man has been born
[24:15] again
[24:16] and they have struggled
[24:18] to make it and made it
[24:21] but done things like luther smoking the
[24:23] pipe and drinking the beer they we don't
[24:25] do that
[24:26] we do it at justification still if you
[24:29] smoke the justification you can be
[24:30] justified and still be smoking
[24:33] you can't be still smoking and
[24:34] sanctified because remember the unclean
[24:36] spirit goes out at sanctification
[24:39] and you surely better not be you're born
[24:41] again because you'd be fooled because
[24:42] you're not you're right okay just don't
[24:44] fool yourself right all right
[24:47] but still
[24:48] in that justification that white
[24:50] righteous church then that makes you
[24:52] white
[24:53] righteous as righteous is who god is
[24:56] but now that comes like sister trudy
[24:58] says that comes from an understanding
[24:59] that you've been taught to that place
[25:03] it's not just you know people in the
[25:04] message go
[25:06] well i'm in the message and this the end
[25:07] time and this adoption and you know i've
[25:09] been preaching
[25:10] um
[25:11] when dad preached that sermon chosen in
[25:12] him several months ago i haven't got off
[25:14] of that i've been preaching in every
[25:15] church that i've been to because it just
[25:17] keeps opening more and more and more
[25:19] because we got to realize that we were
[25:20] chosen in him
[25:22] before the foundation of the world
[25:24] that's mature people that's not for
[25:25] babies and i tell them right up front i
[25:27] said look this thing this ain't milk
[25:30] this is not for babies when you come to
[25:31] that realization that you were chosen in
[25:33] him before the foundation of the world
[25:35] that's not milk
[25:37] milk is this right here you were lost
[25:39] you needed to be justified you needed
[25:41] somebody to take your place
[25:43] that's milk
[25:45] but when you realize that that person
[25:47] took your place and then come to reside
[25:49] in you and didn't finish it he's
[25:51] continuing to work
[25:53] that's where you start chewing on some
[25:54] steak
[25:56] because once we realized we were chosen
[25:58] in him before the foundation in the
[25:59] world
[26:01] this is not going to matter
[26:04] he didn't choose this that's right but
[26:06] this has got to go it's got to be
[26:08] changed to fulfill
[26:11] this
[26:12] we which are alive and remain
[26:14] that the coming lord should not prevent
[26:15] our hindus something's got to happen
[26:17] to change our body that's what these
[26:19] seals are for they're for the body
[26:21] change
[26:22] they're not just that the seals are open
[26:24] and everybody can read the open book
[26:25] that's good
[26:29] but the highest form
[26:31] is when you really
[26:33] can look at yourself in the word we're
[26:36] not going to get the sanctification so
[26:37] some of you that didn't do your homework
[26:39] you can get sanctification because i
[26:40] gotta go
[26:41] hook brother jewel up and uh make sure
[26:43] he doesn't break our
[26:44] microphone
[26:47] look up sanctification that's the next
[26:49] one coming up sanctification
[26:51] but justification we'll cover a little
[26:52] bit but then we'll be finished with that
