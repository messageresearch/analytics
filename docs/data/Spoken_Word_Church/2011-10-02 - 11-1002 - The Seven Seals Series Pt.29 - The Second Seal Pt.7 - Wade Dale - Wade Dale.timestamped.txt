[0:00] and go our week end is okay and go
[0:03] now the hunting season's up everybody uh
[0:05] open everybody
[0:12] and one more thing if anybody last night
[0:14] if you were not in a bible study which
[0:16] most of you were
[0:17] um
[0:19] this is
[0:21] i'll put this on the internet too
[0:23] that
[0:25] brother bob black sent me this and we
[0:27] were talking about the doctrine of the
[0:29] river jordan doctrine that was going
[0:30] around the message
[0:33] there was a man named cerenthus
[0:36] back in john the apostles time and
[0:39] polycarp and irenaeus's time
[0:42] that preach the same thing he denied the
[0:45] supernatural birth of jesus making him
[0:46] the son of joseph and mary and
[0:48] distinguished him from christ who
[0:49] descended upon him after baptism and
[0:51] left him against the crucifixion so
[0:53] this man
[0:54] actually
[0:57] 30 years 40 years after jesus died was
[0:59] already
[1:01] denying the deity of jesus christ saying
[1:03] that he was just a man he was born a man
[1:05] walked through the earth as a man then
[1:07] god came down and made him god and then
[1:08] he walked through life as god for three
[1:10] and a half years and then god left him
[1:12] and he was
[1:14] crucified just a man
[1:18] and then i'll just read this to you but
[1:20] it is name is serentis
[1:22] c-e-r-i-n-t-h-u-s and you can pull it up
[1:24] on the website just punch in sarenthus
[1:26] it'll tell you all the things there's a
[1:28] lettering page about him it's a whole
[1:30] page here but this is kind of
[1:32] this is something that you and i
[1:35] y'all think that i'm a little brash
[1:37] listen to what john
[1:39] john the apostle
[1:41] said to have so detested surrenders that
[1:43] he once fled a bath house when he found
[1:45] out that cerenthus was inside he went
[1:48] running out the door saying let us flee
[1:49] lest the building fall down for
[1:51] surrenders the enemy of the truth is
[1:53] inside wow
[1:56] go to a church and do that
[1:59] flee
[2:00] the enemy of the truth
[2:03] right
[2:05] and one tradition maintains that john
[2:07] wrote the first two epistles you know
[2:08] john wrote the three little john john
[2:10] one john two first john second john
[2:11] third john they say he wrote the first
[2:13] two johns
[2:15] in
[2:16] count to counter cerethis's heresy
[2:20] but
[2:21] look at the same devil
[2:23] because chris got this from pagan
[2:26] gnosticism and gnosticism is spelled
[2:28] g-n-o-s-t-i-c-i-s-i-m
[2:31] and he mixed them with christianity now
[2:33] what did the roman catholic church do
[2:35] same thing
[2:36] took astor to jupiter to mars and all
[2:39] these and put them into peter paul
[2:43] of saints
[2:44] so this guy this man was the same thing
[2:48] see he said that jesus had a dual nature
[2:50] he was both jesus and the christ now
[2:53] people that's exactly what they're
[2:55] teaching in the message
[2:56] that's that exact same devil right there
[3:00] in the message right here
[3:03] i'm not saying the people are devil
[3:05] the devil's the devil
[3:07] then he gets on people
[3:10] and
[3:11] so this river jordan doctrine that
[3:13] everybody's
[3:15] you know so
[3:16] split over
[3:19] started 2 000 years ago
[3:22] actually started in the garden of eden
[3:26] when jesus went to jesus when satan told
[3:28] eve she'd be like god
[3:31] no we don't want to be like god
[3:33] satan wants to be like god
[3:35] we want to be god man manifest in
[3:37] another form you know i had a question
[3:39] several years ago that
[3:41] i didn't know how many devils there were
[3:44] you go back that far and you've got a
[3:46] devil that was
[3:48] and the way it was told to me
[3:50] and it makes sense
[3:52] once the devil
[3:53] gets on somebody
[3:55] and they believe that
[3:57] that belief will stay with
[4:00] so he can leave that person right and
[4:02] just go to another person right so you
[4:04] can see why it doesn't have to be the
[4:06] millions of people in the world you know
[4:08] you know brother brown said those devils
[4:09] don't die
[4:11] the people die and they just move over
[4:12] to another person like keith always said
[4:15] in jamaica they've got the same problems
[4:17] we do it's just a different name right
[4:20] same devil different name
[4:22] you know different name same devil so
[4:24] same way with this and i'm glad brother
[4:26] bob black pulled this up because
[4:29] we see
[4:31] even
[4:32] one of the other brothers that preaches
[4:34] that jesus was not
[4:36] bodily resurrected
[4:38] he's a message preacher
[4:40] that they took jesus body throated out
[4:41] in the desert
[4:44] well
[4:45] that's exactly what if you keep on going
[4:47] sirensis also said to have taught that
[4:50] jesus was raised from the will be raised
[4:52] from the dead at the last day that he
[4:54] was not resurrected
[4:56] at the time of the resurrection
[4:58] that that body just went away and jesus
[5:00] will come back and
[5:02] resurrect enough and a new body
[5:04] so
[5:05] lady i don't understand i was reading
[5:07] the book on the nights
[5:08] templar and i wanted a it's good
[5:12] story and brings in a lot of facts but
[5:15] when it gets to the last few chapters
[5:18] i was waiting to find out what their
[5:20] thing was
[5:22] well it came to where they found this
[5:24] box that was gold embossed
[5:26] opened it up and it had the bones of
[5:28] jesus
[5:29] okay he didn't resurrect he died they
[5:32] had his bones okay so that's
[5:35] catholic all of it is catholic doctrine
[5:37] covered over in something else
[5:39] sure
[5:41] because everybody and seed message
[5:44] believers are so much you say roman
[5:45] catholic and they go devil antichrist
[5:48] but when you take that demon and you put
[5:50] it over in the message and you slide it
[5:51] in under a little bit different name or
[5:53] a little bit different doctrine see yeah
[5:55] see the message people are not teaching
[5:57] that joseph and mary
[5:59] they know that jesus was born virgin
[6:03] because the prophet taught that
[6:05] so they can't teach like the whole thing
[6:06] that serrantha said serena said that
[6:08] joseph and mary had the body of jesus
[6:11] which we know that's wrong
[6:13] because of the teachings of the prophet
[6:14] so they can't get by those quotes they
[6:15] just say okay well he was virgin born
[6:17] but he wasn't god until the river jordan
[6:19] well they just take pieces of this
[6:20] doctrine satan satan could not take this
[6:23] whole doctrine
[6:24] and hand it to people in the message
[6:26] because they wouldn't believe it
[6:28] but he takes bits and pieces and he puts
[6:30] a little hair and he puts a little hair
[6:31] and puts a little here
[6:32] and
[6:33] you come up with
[6:35] false teaching
[6:37] while teaching makes false people right
[6:40] that's why i don't listen to
[6:42] people i just want to
[6:44] give the lord thanks this morning for
[6:46] our trip down to vidalia that's a one
[6:49] long trip
[6:50] uh-huh and moving furniture in the
[6:52] process too so we didn't get until about
[6:55] 10 o'clock last night but i sure
[6:57] appreciate god's nurse
[6:59] you're late
[7:00] okay
[7:05] hey brother joe
[7:07] how you doing good to see you good to
[7:09] see you

[7:20] your blood count your blood count goes
[7:22] up so your blood count must be

[8:37] well i appreciate all your friends
[8:44] okay all right let's go to the second
[8:46] seal go to chapter six of revelation
[8:52] and good to have everybody here
[8:55] with us today
[8:57] and we have a room full if we get any
[8:59] more we're gonna have to have it outside
[9:02] we're in the building
[9:06] oh no we won't do it outside
[9:13] we'll send it away then y'all stay in
[9:14] here
[9:16] i don't have sister gwen and my
[9:19] fan on this morning
[9:29] okay
[9:30] revelation 6
[9:32] all right
[9:33] good to have sister francine with his
[9:34] wrong way
[9:37] all right
[9:39] second seal
[9:40] when he had opened the second seal i
[9:41] heard the second beast say come and see
[9:43] they went out another horse that was red
[9:45] the power was given to him that sat
[9:47] there on to take peace from the earth
[9:49] and that they should kill one another
[9:50] and there was given unto him a great
[9:52] sword
[9:54] power was given and a sword was given
[9:57] and it's just like we were talking just
[9:59] now about this river jordan doctrine and
[10:01] all this junk that's going around in the
[10:02] message
[10:06] the bible says
[10:08] that god will
[10:10] let you believe a lie
[10:12] and be down by it just like what we were
[10:14] talking about you take that doctrine in
[10:17] any doctrine i'm going to talk about
[10:18] this day any false doctrine you take
[10:20] that in
[10:21] and what's going to happen if you
[10:22] nurture that thing it's going to grow
[10:25] because it's the law that god put you
[10:28] know you say well why did god let all
[10:30] these evil people it's a law
[10:32] man and wife gets together have a child
[10:35] verb and egg comes together
[10:38] really doesn't matter who it comes from
[10:40] but it's the law of god god said in the
[10:42] beginning let each specie bring forth of
[10:44] his kind so that law is continued
[10:48] all right until the law be done away
[10:49] with and christ makes us a new creator
[10:52] and that a new creation and that way mom
[10:54] and daddy didn't have anything to do
[10:55] with this now i can't say mom and daddy
[10:57] made me this way
[10:59] mom and dad didn't make the inside man
[11:01] this way
[11:02] mom and daddy might have helped the
[11:03] outside guy get here but the inside
[11:04] person mom and dad didn't help get here
[11:06] all right same thing with this and then
[11:08] what do we do
[11:10] you feed a kid rotten food
[11:12] he's going to stun his growth or he's
[11:14] going to get sick and that's what we got
[11:15] we got a lot of sick people in the
[11:16] message
[11:17] not physically sick mentally sick or
[11:19] spiritually sick
[11:21] all right especially sick's worse than
[11:22] anything
[11:23] but you take those little girls right
[11:25] there and quit feeding them right don't
[11:27] feed them anymore
[11:29] don't feed them nothing else what's
[11:30] going to happen
[11:31] they're going to stun it they're grown
[11:33] and then they're going to eventually die
[11:34] well that's what why
[11:36] couldn't you quit feeding them
[11:38] same way with you
[11:39] feed this guy in here we know we can
[11:42] feed the outside guy it's evident
[11:49] not more than others
[11:51] except joyce she's an anomaly
[12:09] but that's the way we see that how god's
[12:11] worked in this in this second seal
[12:14] because the sword was given which is a
[12:15] what it's a doctrine
[12:17] you say god give him that doctrine no
[12:19] god didn't give a false doctrine to
[12:21] anybody god can't give false
[12:24] but he can put the true out and let the
[12:26] faults be perverted
[12:27] all right
[12:28] god can't send perverted word
[12:30] god's word is eternal god's word is
[12:33] perfect
[12:34] anything other than that is perverted so
[12:36] satan
[12:37] satan takes the word he can't create a
[12:39] new word because he's not a creator
[12:42] but he can take what god gives
[12:45] and do this right here he power was
[12:47] given to what take peace and kill well
[12:49] that's not what that's not god's
[12:50] characteristic so we know that satan
[12:52] characteristic
[12:53] the red horse was blood
[12:55] combat beast was the ox
[12:58] the church age is the
[13:00] fourth age the dark ages just put it on
[13:02] there just for a minute
[13:04] and get this up because we'll probably
[13:06] go to the third sale after we get back
[13:09] but i want to i want to stop in a few
[13:10] minutes and and then we'll take
[13:12] questions
[13:13] on the second seal if you don't have if
[13:15] you have a question about it only the
[13:17] second seal don't do like brother brown
[13:19] said only on the seals and then ask
[13:20] about
[13:21] riches and pajamas and
[13:24] hairpins
[13:25] so
[13:27] but the first spirit
[13:29] all this is spirits right this is not a
[13:32] literal man getting on the horse these
[13:34] are symbols symbols of spirits all right
[13:37] and spirits working in what the horse is
[13:39] what people power people give them the
[13:41] power satan gets on the horse he gets
[13:44] off one gets on the other horse what he
[13:46] gets on the people
[13:48] he gets on the people and rides through
[13:52] killing the people brother branham said
[13:54] physically killed the people in the dark
[13:56] ages and then spiritually killed
[13:57] billions of people by doctrine
[14:00] so we saw in the first seal that the
[14:02] antichrist spirit was beginning to form
[14:04] just like we read right here from from
[14:07] cyrenthus
[14:08] that little bitty saying
[14:10] well jesus wasn't really christ but
[14:13] christ came on him at the river jordan
[14:15] see that's just a little seed planted it
[14:18] took 300 more years
[14:20] to have a nice in council and then 300
[14:22] more years for them to come at 606 a.d
[14:25] and say that jesus was a separate
[14:27] substance of god now i've heard people
[14:28] in the message say exact same words
[14:30] jesus was a separate identity or a
[14:32] substance than god it's the same
[14:33] doctrine it was at nicea
[14:35] council
[14:37] coming from the catholic church
[14:39] actually it comes from satan right we
[14:41] name it catholic church but it comes
[14:43] from satan
[14:44] but the antichrist spirit remember
[14:46] brother ronald said it was a spirit and
[14:48] so it couldn't be crowned so they put a
[14:49] pope in and they crowned him all right
[14:52] then it becomes what what does the false
[14:53] prophet do that's the second seal false
[14:55] prophet does what he teaches a doctrine
[14:59] but he's false but he is a prophet
[15:04] he's a prophet
[15:05] but he teaches false doctrine
[15:08] thoughts sword
[15:11] but look
[15:13] that sword was given
[15:16] to satan
[15:20] but didn't have any power
[15:22] it had no power
[15:24] until it got on this horse
[15:27] satan has no power unless power is given
[15:30] the bible says resist the devil and
[15:32] he'll flee from you that's
[15:33] pretty simple
[15:35] but it's pretty eternal
[15:37] pretty profound
[15:39] that you can just resist him
[15:41] and he'll flee from you
[15:43] you don't have to do penance you don't
[15:44] have to get on the floor you don't have
[15:45] to
[15:46] you know
[15:48] stay 24 hail mary's and pay the preacher
[15:50] resist him
[15:52] just say no
[15:54] eve just couldn't say no
[15:56] she said no she thought she was doing
[15:57] the right thing
[15:58] that's our problem sometimes we delve
[16:00] into things and me too we delve into
[16:02] things and we go
[16:04] i really shouldn't have done
[16:06] that was the devil i really shouldn't
[16:09] have done that satan you got me on that
[16:11] one
[16:12] if you won't get me a second time on
[16:14] that one you might get me on something
[16:15] else but you don't get me on that one
[16:17] all right so we got a false prophet
[16:20] so the next thing we're going to look at
[16:22] is the third seal
[16:24] and let's just go ahead and let's just
[16:25] read it to get a to get a background and
[16:28] then we'll drop back
[16:29] third seal
[16:31] first five
[16:32] that's fine tim i'm not gonna i'm gonna
[16:34] be
[16:37] and when it opened the third seal
[16:39] i heard the third beast say come and see
[16:41] and i'll be held in a little black horse
[16:44] he that sat on him had a pair of
[16:46] balances in his
[16:48] hand i heard a voice in the midst of the
[16:52] four beasts saying
[16:53] a measure of wheat for a penny and three
[16:54] measures of barley for a penny
[16:56] see that'll hurt not the oil
[17:00] and the wine all right so that's the
[17:02] next one i want you to get that in your
[17:03] thought
[17:04] read the third seal in your book
[17:07] and
[17:08] we'll make some comments on it but
[17:09] second seal anybody have any questions
[17:11] on
[17:13] the second seal any of the symbols or
[17:14] any of them
[17:21] i mean he's a prophet
[17:23] brother brown said he was a false
[17:24] prophet to a fault system well the
[17:26] system made him the prophet god didn't
[17:28] make him a prophet
[17:29] he's not a prophet like in well balaam
[17:31] see balaam was a prophet that was a
[17:33] person one person balaam
[17:37] this false prophet doesn't have a name
[17:40] except pope but it's a succession of
[17:43] people it's not
[17:44] balaam you understand what i'm saying so
[17:46] god made balaam a pope
[17:50] sorry god made balaam a prophet
[17:53] because remember prophets were born
[17:55] prophets but this is not talking about
[17:56] one person this is talking about system
[18:00] a system a hierarchy
[18:02] all right so there's not one because you
[18:04] can say well which one was the false
[18:05] problem
[18:06] the whole system brother brown said it's
[18:08] an antichrist system
[18:10] what is a system consists of people not
[18:12] one person sure they got one head that
[18:15] they look up to which is the pope
[18:17] but
[18:18] being a false prophet brother brown said
[18:20] he was a false prophet to a false system
[18:24] brother adam also said false teaching
[18:25] brings false birth
[18:28] which is the birth but it's false all
[18:31] right
[18:32] so now
[18:34] it's just true that's not a person
[18:36] that's not one that's not balaam i see
[18:38] what you're talking about
[18:48] no you don't know or you'll still be
[18:50] asking the question let's just be honest
[18:52] that you got a question no gifts and
[18:53] callings
[18:54] i could be the biggest devil ever lived
[18:56] standing right here and you'd be just
[18:58] rejoicing over the word of god
[19:01] gifts and callings are without
[19:02] repentance god knew i had an ability to
[19:04] get people to listen to me
[19:07] okay
[19:11] well that was in the world too
[19:13] you understand i could get people to do
[19:15] what i wanted them to do
[19:18] and i could manipulate everybody in this
[19:19] room
[19:20] if i wanted to maybe that's why i
[19:23] stay away from a lot of it
[19:25] not stay away but you know like me in
[19:27] regina
[19:35] because i can manipulate anybody i want
[19:38] to don't fool yourself any preacher can
[19:41] manipulate
[19:43] anybody they want to you watch them do
[19:45] it now they're doing it now look at it
[19:47] look out in the world
[19:49] of the
[19:51] but look in the message
[19:53] how they just manipulate the people
[19:56] well you know just little puppets why
[19:58] they're using the gift people are
[20:00] wanting a leader right so they're going
[20:02] to pull it from that person they make
[20:04] him
[20:06] that's true
[20:07] you're going to get this morning what
[20:09] you prayed for if you didn't pray for
[20:10] anything you don't get anything
[20:12] if you pray for something god's going
[20:14] you know we've kind of not been on the
[20:15] second seal a whole lot
[20:17] maybe we don't need to but it's what
[20:20] you're pulling from
[20:22] because we're truly servants
[20:24] but see if i can get you to believe that
[20:26] i'm the number one guy
[20:28] and you've got to listen to me
[20:30] and i hear straight from god
[20:34] then what anything i say
[20:37] whether it be losing a hundred dollars
[20:39] or
[20:40] anything like that
[20:42] i was trying to make a point
[20:45] you might need to get up that way yeah
[20:53] but listen
[20:55] gifts and callings listen the bible says
[20:58] gifts
[20:59] and callings
[21:01] many are called
[21:02] but fewer chosen god could call me for a
[21:04] gift and if i don't yield myself to god
[21:07] if i keep yielding myself to the devil
[21:09] guess what
[21:11] i'll become a false prophet i don't have
[21:13] to be a prophet
[21:16] don't get hung on this word right here
[21:19] i'm a prophet today
[21:22] for the prophets who the word comes to
[21:25] be it balaam because the word came to
[21:28] balaam because bayley knew exactly
[21:30] how many land how many rounds to kill he
[21:33] knew how to get an audience with god so
[21:35] he was a prophet he just brother brown
[21:37] said he leaned toward three things money
[21:39] women popularity
[21:41] he leaned toward money
[21:43] he was a hiring prophet
[21:49] so this person right here though is not
[21:51] a
[21:52] not like balaam in the sense that he was
[21:54] born a prophet this is not one person
[21:57] this is a system that's not like brother
[22:00] no no this don't get hunched what i said
[22:01] don't get hung on this word prophet
[22:03] did they know the truth
[22:05] do i the false prophets know the truth
[22:07] and just preach well somewhere it has to
[22:10] be presented to them but they have to
[22:11] take that and twist it just a little bit
[22:13] because satan knows what the truth is
[22:16] he was there when it's all started
[22:19] he knows the word better than we do like
[22:21] i said before he's in church more to
[22:22] rest y'all
[22:24] gets here early very early the catholic
[22:27] system knows this message forward and
[22:29] backwards
[22:30] oh sure i mean they you want to quote
[22:32] that quote
[22:34] but
[22:35] this
[22:36] somewhere
[22:37] everything leaned to
[22:39] to the side of the anti
[22:41] anti word
[22:42] because to say that the catholics have
[22:45] all false doctrine it's not true
[22:48] to say that the baptist have all false
[22:50] doctrine is not true
[22:52] brother brown said even part truth and
[22:55] brother branham some of those roman
[22:56] catholics way back when he said they
[22:58] lived the life they were supposed to
[22:59] live
[23:00] everything they knew they lived in
[23:03] it was just faults from the hierarchy
[23:07] they were following the leader
[23:09] but see this is not a leader this is
[23:11] leaders
[23:13] because there's only one pope we know
[23:14] that but there's a whole lot of look at
[23:16] all these other
[23:17] dioceses that you've got so many people
[23:20] over here that's under the pope you got
[23:21] so many that's this and the pope that
[23:23] was now remember he was uh he was kind
[23:25] of the pope over the um
[23:27] the
[23:28] jesuits right you got homes everywhere
[23:30] so you got false prophet system
[23:33] this is not one person
[23:35] this is a system
[23:37] just like the seals are not for one
[23:39] person
[23:40] it's for us right
[23:42] but we're not an organization we're an
[23:44] organism
[23:46] organization is is what they try to do
[23:49] listen to us we'll tell you
[23:51] what we want you to hear right
[23:54] see but if we're truly
[23:56] born again and and we do have the truth
[23:59] of the message of the hour
[24:01] then you draw what you need
[24:05] from god not what i want to tell you
[24:07] that's the difference
[24:09] they tell you what they want to tell you
[24:11] oh don't read the bible it's confusing
[24:14] we'll interpret it and we'll give it to
[24:15] you
[24:17] that's not the way we the bible says
[24:19] study to show yourself approved
[24:21] a workman needs not be ashamed rightly
[24:22] divide rightly divided you've got to
[24:24] divide whether i'm telling you the
[24:26] future
[24:28] okay
[24:29] a lot of people
[24:44] i've always said listen to this exactly
[24:46] listen to this example
[24:48] when they came out with that movie
[24:51] left behind
[24:52] you remember that yes anybody watching i
[24:54] did
[24:56] what they watched what this come from
[24:59] secular or not secular but protestant
[25:02] baptist methodist pentecost or whatever
[25:04] that side not the catholic side but we
[25:06] know the catholic church has something
[25:07] to do with it because they own the media
[25:09] so they let out what they want to let
[25:10] out that's right
[25:12] so this left behind was that this man
[25:15] which was what was his name the boy
[25:17] camera kirk cameron
[25:18] kirk cameron was the star
[25:20] where kurt cameron was a a bad boy
[25:24] scene of the movie opens and all these
[25:27] cars are wrecked
[25:29] follow me here the cars are all wrecked
[25:31] on the interstate planes are falling out
[25:33] of the sky the guys on the television
[25:35] screen saying
[25:36] thousands of people have disappeared
[25:39] the rapture took place so they say
[25:43] at least you know there's no pilot to
[25:45] the plane all of a sudden you turn
[25:46] around look there's no pilot there you
[25:47] know in the planes you know and the cars
[25:49] on the interstate there's no drivers
[25:53] so yeah so
[25:55] so kurt cameron
[25:57] you know everything goes back in his
[25:58] mind where he was raised a little you
[26:00] know a little baptist boy or whatever it
[26:01] was
[26:03] so the raptures took place so td jake
[26:06] everybody knows tv jakes is all right
[26:07] black preacher
[26:08] and he gets on the television he's on
[26:11] the screen on that movie and he's
[26:12] telling the people hey the raptors took
[26:14] place and i thought well you big dummy
[26:20] if you're still here
[26:21] you have problems but now here was the
[26:23] out here was the out kirk cameron was a
[26:26] sinner
[26:27] he realized the rapture took place and
[26:29] td jakes is telling the people hey you
[26:32] need to repent because in the in the in
[26:34] the denominations they believe that that
[26:36] the rapture can take place and that you
[26:38] have a time period that you can be saved
[26:42] which is fault see i told him right then
[26:44] i said see then it went all the way to
[26:45] the end and kirk cameron goes to the u.n
[26:47] and they've got this guy sitting in the
[26:48] u.n and he's just sitting there
[26:50] controlling people's mind one guy gets
[26:52] up and shoots the other guy right in the
[26:54] head
[26:56] and everybody's like oh my god you know
[26:57] what happened well this guy gets up of
[26:59] course he calms everybody down and he
[27:01] says
[27:02] that really didn't happen
[27:05] that really didn't that that didn't go
[27:07] on that did you see did anybody see that
[27:10] you could see the people's mind changing
[27:12] to him
[27:13] and they're looking around they're like
[27:14] well no that didn't really happen the
[27:15] only dragging the guy off you know he's
[27:17] all blown off be blown away well that
[27:19] didn't really happen well see kurt
[27:21] cameron looks and says well that's the
[27:23] antichrist it was a man
[27:25] that he was changing and controlling
[27:26] people's mind well i told you and i said
[27:29] the antichrist started when they when
[27:32] they said that you can be saved after
[27:33] the rapture that's when the antichrist
[27:35] started the whole movie was antichrist
[27:37] right the whole movie was antichrist not
[27:40] the antichrist at the end and all this
[27:42] is real christianity
[27:44] see to me that to me that's
[27:46] that's what satan is doing he has
[27:48] transformed the people's mind to believe
[27:52] that well you know what that makes
[27:55] that makes lazy people
[27:57] lazy christian well i'll just wait till
[27:59] people disappear and when mom and daddy
[28:01] disappeared i'm gonna go to church
[28:04] and get saved you know
[28:07] uh not gonna happen where's the secret
[28:09] in all of this exactly
[28:11] where was the secret
[28:13] the secret
[28:14] oh there wasn't i mean it just i mean it
[28:16] was just
[28:18] the movie was just completely almost
[28:20] fictitious and laughable to me it should
[28:23] have been to the nominal christians but
[28:24] they all had a
[28:26] you know glory hallelujah fit about it
[28:28] they loved it but it was what
[28:30] because of their prior teaching
[28:34] if you can get somebody to believe that
[28:37] and put out a movie they're going to sit
[28:39] there with that same spell that was what
[28:42] got me they're gonna sit there with that
[28:43] same spell that they said that
[28:45] antichrist at the united nations you
[28:47] know this guy real charismatic real nice
[28:49] looking gentleman he just stands up and
[28:51] he says
[28:52] we didn't see that happen did you see
[28:54] that happen you just see the people you
[28:56] know change in their mind you know and
[28:58] he was controlling them well see that
[29:00] was supposed to be the antichrist guy
[29:02] that raises up you know
[29:04] but it was the whole movie it was
[29:05] anti-word
[29:07] so see there's where we get
[29:10] false teaching
[29:12] it's a false prophet system
[29:14] not one person a system
[29:17] we're all born again
[29:19] individually
[29:21] we're not
[29:22] just roman catholics and you're
[29:23] religious or you're roman catholics and
[29:25] you're a christian you know
[29:27] no you're born again individually
[29:30] then you respond to what god teaches all
[29:32] right anybody else you've got about two
[29:34] minutes
[29:50] the second seal i think i mentioned it a
[29:52] few weeks ago and i kind of don't like
[29:53] being gone a lot
[29:55] but it just happened that way okay
[29:58] but
[29:59] this
[30:01] remember what the first
[30:03] the first aid or the first seal was what
[30:05] justification justify all right
[30:09] this one is always blood is what
[30:19] blood always speaks of sanctification
[30:22] and as they
[30:24] were killed
[30:26] there was a group being sanctified in
[30:28] that fourth age
[30:31] and the same way with you and i the
[30:32] second seal applies to a christian
[30:35] is that we see that
[30:38] i preached it one time down at brother
[30:39] keith brown's church and it really
[30:40] helped the people
[30:42] because we always take the seals as
[30:44] something horrible and something awful
[30:46] and it is
[30:48] if you take the natural part you don't
[30:49] want to be here with that natural seal
[30:51] all right
[30:52] but the spiritual part you and i get but
[30:54] you got to flip-flop it
[30:57] because it can't be it can't be judgment
[31:00] to me and you
[31:02] it's got to be something god gives us to
[31:04] change this body
[31:05] so start looking at the seals as for the
[31:08] redemption of your body we went over
[31:09] this when we first started
[31:11] and it's for not to sanctify the inside
[31:14] person if you're born again you don't
[31:15] need sanctification in your soul right
[31:18] paul said i die daily because this guy's
[31:20] the one that does the bad right right
[31:23] i do have
[31:24] almost a dual nation
[31:26] i got the nature of god i got the nature
[31:28] mama daddy gave me
[31:30] which is controlled by the world if we
[31:32] let it right but like daddy said last
[31:34] night brother ryan's question was
[31:37] your glorified body is being built
[31:38] around your born-again experience it's
[31:40] not that your arm gets holy first
[31:43] just for a carnal example your leg gets
[31:45] holy next and you know god's not
[31:47] building a physical body
[31:49] he's already built the body by the word
[31:52] but when we feed off of it it's not like
[31:54] a little piece of us is going to start
[31:56] getting glorified
[31:57] no
[31:58] it's right here that's wrong
[32:01] those who he has justified he's already
[32:03] glorified
[32:04] we just don't believe that
[32:09] if we believed it we'd be gone already
[32:11] right
[32:12] when we realize that god's already done
[32:14] this sign sealed and delivered
[32:17] and that you and i walk into that that's
[32:19] our walk we walk into that
[32:21] when we walk into that
[32:23] the scripture's not gonna have to change
[32:25] we're gonna have to change
[32:27] scripture don't change those who he's
[32:29] justified he's already
[32:31] glorified if you're born again today
[32:34] you're already in your glorified
[32:35] condition going toward
[32:38] change of the body which has got to
[32:39] happen changing the body's got to happen
[32:41] all right everybody understand we're not
[32:43] we're not glorified and and
[32:46] nothing's going to bother us no we're
[32:48] heading toward that
[32:50] but it's like i said about the kids
[32:52] stop coming to church stop reading your
[32:54] bible stop praying
[32:57] you'll die
[32:59] you'll die
[33:00] just like quit feeding the children
[33:01] their children
[33:03] their sons and daughters of god but quit
[33:05] feeding they'll die
[33:06] sons and daughters of god now are dying
[33:08] because they're not being fed
[33:09] spiritually they're dead first then
[33:12] god's got to take them naturally
[33:14] because they can't go on and attain to
[33:16] the change so this sanctification is to
[33:18] make sure that this guy's clean
[33:20] paul didn't say i die daily because my
[33:22] soul is bad one day and good the next no
[33:25] he's talking about oh wretched man that
[33:27] i am this guy
[33:30] not the inside he knew that that inside
[33:32] guy was perfect complete
[33:34] why could he say what he does in the old
[33:35] in the new testament
[33:37] those who he's justified that's paul
[33:39] said that
[33:40] those who he justifies already glorified
[33:42] that's why that they could listen to
[33:45] paul
[33:46] hear him preach about a resurrection
[33:48] paul was talking about a resurrection of
[33:50] this old guy that they couldn't see
[33:52] inside
[33:53] so phillips and hymenius they go off and
[33:56] start them a church
[33:59] and start them a river jordan doctrine
[34:02] doctrine that paul says the resurrection
[34:04] has already happened remember he had to
[34:06] go rebuke him you know what they said
[34:08] i'm sure this is what they said starting
[34:09] the bible they said what preaching
[34:10] weren't you praying for
[34:12] no they weren't
[34:14] paul said i'm speaking of an out
[34:16] resurrection the lord's getting this guy
[34:17] out of dead words
[34:19] not that this resurrection that already
[34:21] passed
[34:22] because they took what he said
[34:25] and done what
[34:27] twisted it and made a new doctrine
[34:30] all right so y'all next sunday and then
[34:32] lord back
