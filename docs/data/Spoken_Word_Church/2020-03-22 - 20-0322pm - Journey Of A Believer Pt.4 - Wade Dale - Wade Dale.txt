========================================

light of your glory thank you Lord pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy hi shiny in the light of your glory and man you're loving tonight hold out your power in love as we say holy holy [Music] holy holy holy I want to see you hey man good to see everybody house with Lord good to be with each and every one of you today and the ones that are listening in from the comfort of your home would say god bless you if you here watching listening for the first time then god bless you we're gonna do the best with what we got amen we've been given an opportunity to use the technologies that the devil you've and devil uses it does his junk with it and we're gonna use it and for God's glory ma'am so we're going to we're going to just continue on and Wednesday night service brother Bob will be here and we'll be conducting it in the same way we are conducting it now everybody got that say ma'am well start at seven o'clock with just the crew that we got here the eight or ten or so a couple of musicians and that's what we're doing so we're we're okay with that everything's fine we're we're washing our hands and doing all that but we want to be like Martin Luther we don't want to cause anything to happen to someone else because we're they've noticed online there was somebody from somewhere not a message believer but they were just you know adamant they were gonna have full church and that's okay but I'm like brother Dale said the when brother Branham said she'll have just that the Lord or beef still well we don't have thus that the Lord that we can put ninety people back in this building not yet okay so we be still and know who's in control Amanda that's the way we're gonna do it from now on and until this thing is over with you know I was I was thinking yesterday about all the plagues and things that's hit this earth and you know even in the time of Moses Moses that's reading in Leviticus in different places how that they would get kind they'd be sinning and and God was sent a plague but he would also send Aaron with the sensor which was too far off the altar but now remember it stayed the plague it didn't eradicate it because there would be seven thousand killed in one day twenty thousand killed before they could get through that and that's the way I'm praying now that Lord we can't do anything about the ones that's passed on but may we as the bride of Jesus Christ all over the world take that fire off the altar which is not a literal fire announced inside of us and take that sensor and go out in don't go out into the world you understand what I'm saying but pray that God will stay this plague and then because that's what he in the Bible the whole Bible has plagues and different things that happened and we had the Spanish flu we were talking about this morning and it happened after the 1906 Azusa Street revival the Spanish flu started in 1918 and killed 50 million people in the world and a lot of our servicemen came home with it and there was 57,000 people in the United States killed but brother Branham tells us he every time we look at this that influenza was one of the plagues that God poured out us in the Seven Church ages 1954 I'm looking at it right now when the mystery was revealed the baptism of the Holy Ghost the people didn't move on when the baptism the Holy Ghost came on the zoo the street 1906 people started turning it down God sent a plague all right so what do we see now people are turning the word down people are turning the message of the hour down I'm not talk about the world the world turned it down when from the beginning I'm talking about two people in our ranks that's turning this thing down and got sinning the plague and it's for the whole it's a plague on the whole earth it's not just a plague on a certain group of people it's a plague on the whole earth so we just pray that God will stay that plague eyes praying yesterday I said God my children need salvation my grandchildren my my the people in this on this wall down below me they need salvation we need to absolutely pray more earnestly because that's why God's sensor sends a plague it he sends a play going to people who reject the word you don't send it on us I mean we're like the children of Israel we're in the lamb big ocean you know the plagues fell everywhere else but the children of Israel the chosen people of God went to Goshen well what's our Goshen the Word of God is our Goshen so we come here to get the word out to you out in the in the on the Internet and for those of us standing here a few of us here today that are just we're just support people that's here alone I want to reiterate that this is not normal but I don't want we're not gonna do away someone sent me a text message yesterday and wanted to know why that we were not letting the sisters play instruments anymore anymore that was the new norm they didn't read Bob's email right so it's just it just wasn't said that way this is temporary we want them to stay home with their children we want them to not not get out stay home with the children I don't have anything if the sisters wanted to come but we're just doing this because this is the pillar of the church this is the pillar of the people the Deacons the elder not even the elders the Deacons the pastors the system preachers deacons song leaders that's your spiritual leaders of the church and we feel that maybe being here that we can get it out to you remember we're still sheep sheep have to be led even even the president told us yesterday whatever you want to think of him I really don't care he's doing a pretty good job how would you like to be up there so don't give him no comment about that that's just a bunch of baloney but he's doing the best he can as a human being but he told the people he said look he said don't forget to pay your tithe don't forget to pay your offerings when you while you're not going to church so he didn't he did realize that that everybody needs leadership so we need to come to a place that we calm down and we do what needs to be done we're not invincible on the outside guy but we need to let the inside guy out because he's the invincible one and then as we were singing this morning brother Joe was singing you know when death and sorrow pain and all that's over with we don't have to worry about it no more when our Lord comes back to earth again all the sorrow pain and death this will all be just won't even be a memory because the Bible says the former things are passed away all the bad things you're not going to remember so we're not going to remember any of this but we got to get there first so that's why we're doing this to help it's kind of funny that being preaching on revival that remember what causes a revival a plague falls or something happens on the earth causes a revival so I hope this causes that revival that we've been looking for I hope this causes that word revival that we'll get back into the Word of God even though we're separated out into the parts of different parts of the earth but we all come together under one roof and that's the roof of the word of God amen so let's bow our heads and pray before we get started then we'll begin on on our subject of a journey of a believer we'll kind of recap Abraham's journey and then we'll get into hopefully getting to the baptism of the Holy Ghost so listen let's bow our heads Galatians 3:16 so we're going to start from the Heavenly Father we thank you for this day that you've given us we pray now that you would be Lord the one that does the speaking we know that we're very very very few in number but you said where two or three are gathered in my name that there you'll be in the midst you know we have different ones in different places watching in Lord may you comfort each one father that we have more faith than we do fear and that we'll take this thing Lord and will as a Christian we should get better because of this and not worse we should get better we should bind together more we should trust you more and pray father and I do pray now that you'll help our government that you'll help the people that are there that will do a job that will do the right job and get this thing straightened out Lord because we still need people like brother Dale said this is not the end but this is the beginning of something so this is something that we're looking forward to that word revival that will bind us all together for that last push to get us out of here Father forgive us of our sins bless this day Lord take care of each one just shield us from all this sickness and not just the coronavirus but all their any other kind of thing Lord you said you heal all of our diseases there's not one that you can't heal Lord we pray that you'd be with us and touch us now in Jesus name Amen Galatians 3 verse 16 through 18 now Abraham now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he said not and to seeds as of many so it wasn't the natural lineage of Abraham or Abraham you might want to say but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and I said this I say that the covenant which was confirmed before God in Christ the law which was 430 years other than other words 430 years after Abraham's death can I dis annul that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise okay everybody got that but God gave it to Abraham by promise let's go to Hebrews 6 and even be seated Hebrews 6 verse 13 but when God made promise to Abraham because you could swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured look after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you made me seated in Warren as blessing to the reading of the word here we've come into allergy season and everybody's hacking in coughing I don't think it's the coronavirus thing just a lot of a lot of pollen in the air and I thank God for that because he's pollinating the whole world and it doesn't matter my bees yesterday I was playing with my bees out there you know and letting the world go by and they were just working away they didn't you know they weren't scared they were doing their job so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna not be scared we're gonna do our job I will do just like nature we're just gonna continue on and we're gonna truly pray that this thing takes an end real quick brother Brown says who is this Melchizedek now we know if somebody maybe is watching in that doesn't know sometimes we quote these quotes from we believe God sent a prophet in the end time a seventh angel message which was guaranteed in the Book of Revelations that there would be seven messengers to seven church ages we believe we're in the last church age and we believe that God sent a messenger in every age Paul from Paul all the way down to this man we call William Branham and please don't look it up on the internet because you can all get all the bad so but you see us quote these quotes we're quoting from a prophet that would believe God's sin in the end time to give us a true revelation that we have gotten everybody got so off on different denominational ideas till Jesus Christ came and brought one message not 1,900 he brought one message all right but we as man have divided it into fifteen or sixteen hundred different denominational ideas and they all think they're right so I think God sent us a messenger according to my life kana for Luke to have Athene 1730 revelation 10 verse 7 that there was an endtime messenger sent and that we he was not God he was a messenger sent from God just like Paul we we quote Paul all the time why can't we part why can't we quote william branham ER or john g lake or the different ones that we do mighty men but we believe that william branham was sent in the end time to bring us the message according to malachi I mean according to revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery when mystery of God will be finished and he told us here in 1965 he said when Abraham met him and he was Melchizedek now remember we're going to read that in chapter 17 here in just a little while because remember chapter 17 is the type now remember Abram never had the new birth Abraham never was born again because he was in the Old Testament and the old custom it was under blood I'll get it out in a minute was under the blood of bulls and goats thank you Richard bulls and goats thanks for the help and and that was he was had his sins were covered not eradicated but now since Jesus Christ come 2,000 years ago died on the cross gave us gave his blood gave his life and that life came back into the believer in 120 in the room now God is residing in us not just with us God is not overshadowing us like he did in the Old Testament he should be inside of us because jesus said I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world so Abraham remembered Abraham never was a child of God Abraham was a friend of God but Abraham's journey Abram to Abraham that's what we're talking about now the journey of a believer we believe that we must go through three processes because three is the number of perfection we must go to three processes of salvation now many people teach once saved always saved that's okay if you were saved to begin with if it was true if God justifies you he'll take you to glorification according to the book of Ephesians I believe in there somewhere it tells you that those who he's glorified he's all he's justified he's already glorified but now remember if you justify yourself not good no that's you trying to justify you and I don't want that I want God to be the just one and then the Bible says the just and the justifier are the same all right so I want the justification that God took my sins put them in a sea of God's forgetfulness but I have a walk that I have to walk now that takes me on through to the indwelling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just an anointing or not just coming into a pew and sitting down or not just beginning to read my Bible when I didn't have anything else to read or you know you understand what I'm saying so when Abraham he goes through this journey and he's coming to where he meets Melchizedek and verse in chapter 17 we'll read it a minute the Prophet tells us he unfolds here what all the attributes now each one of us if you're a born-again Christian today you are an attribute of God you were in his mind before the foundation of the world you were you were a part of God now you didn't know that while you was on earth you didn't come to that knowledge until you get to Abraham's journey when he meets Melchizedek all right that's why you can't you say once saved always say that's okay if you continue with your salvation all the way to the end but don't be saved in 1964 and then now in 2019 you're still smoking and drinking and cussing and doing the things you were doing what you get say from salvation is saving you from something repentance is turning and going in that direction not in the direction you were going in so that's what we're speaking of today through Abraham's journey because Abram made a lot of mistakes but God gave the promise to Abram before he was Abraham right all right so that's what we're gonna look at but brother mom tells us he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end now obviously you and I are in the final in if you're if you're an attribute that's your question if you're an attribute and you believe this is the final end time then every son of Abraham which we are the what children of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing so we're going to absolutely take the same journey that Abram took to have a name change to Abraham have one promise son God told him said take Isaac thy son thy only son now he had Ishmael and seven other kids but they weren't the promise there's a lot of things that goes on in your life that you that God will allow to happen but there's only one promise and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost he promised for this promises to you acts 2:38 tells us with promise repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise see that's what Abraham was looking for but he couldn't find that city you and I are that city he was looking for amen CDs not buildings a serious people amen every start of the faith will absolutely do the same thing so every one of us is going to have to be able to put in your journey what we're going to read here from Genesis 12:2 about Genesis 20 we're gonna see the walk of a man named Abram that Walton has many mistakes and does many things out of the will of God but he comes finally to a place to where God tells him in chapter 17 he says I've come now it's time for you to have the promised child so let's read in John twelve right here and you're under justification we see that what is justification justification is chopping off your past sins that means that God has called you you have accepted his call and you turn and you walk in another direction every sin that you have if you're truly justified every sin from that point backwards has been forgiven what a wonderful thing now the Lord said unto Abram get thee out of thy country all right so he's talkin to like I said before what's the difference in Abram if God's not a respecter of persons what's the difference in Abram and in Abraham's neighbor right God may have called everybody that was around Abram but Abram was the only one that physically got up and left get thee out of thy country that's why are you walking and many of us walked in circles of not gangs and gang members but we walked in in gangs of people we enjoyed being around why cuz we all did the same thing and you don't know if God called them but he had to somewhere down in the life he had to call every person has to be called of God but you're the only one you say why me Lord because you responded you responded and he knew you would respond and being that you responded you got up and moved and started doing the things because what happened he said look Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house and I watch it says from thy kindred yeah but remember what's the first thing he does he takes a lot with him unto a land that I will show thee and I will I will watch this I will I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee not anybody else this is God I the great I am I will make thy name great we still call it now six thousand years after after he's done passed off the scene and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and I will curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed so Abram depart the Lord has spoken unto Him and a lot went with him now that was his first mistake remember what we were saying that when Abram got God called Abram and not his kindred not anybody Abram gets up and you know it's just like we do when we get first get born or first get saved we come to a realization that we're lost well we want everybody else to realize their loss too right hey man you want to talk to you buddies and your friends and your girlfriends and all hey man I found this new and sometimes they go like you going crazy well that's kind of what Abram had to separate and you all of us did I hope none of you run with the same gang you used to run with we found a new game to run with hey man the born again we might have found some more Eagles to run around with amen but Abram departed and he took a lot with him and like I said before it's the play of words but he took a lot with it same way with you and I once we even in justification we still have the burden of sin in our past is gone but the same person that made you do it so in other words a week or two or three weeks or a month later if you're still walking in justification you've still got this desire to smoke and drink and cuss and run around and do all the things you did before but God is still though making you send conscious where you weren't sin conscious before he brings it to you but what would you do is you take a lot with you in every journey you take you take a lot with you all right but he's getting ready to separate from a lot are from mr. light amen he's getting ready to separate for him because something where are you gonna have to separate amen if you don't separate then you didn't get it to start with you just got a good feeling all right so now remember he departed and he went to Canaan verse 5 but now when he came to look at verse 7 I told him just keep scrolling through verse 7 and the Lord capital LRD appeared to Abram now if you look in your margin it talks about the Lord and costs theophanies you see that God God comes and he talks to Abram just like God listen did God not talk to you when you were starting your journey God didn't just save you and then say now later on in the journey he might say you know you grow up child but in your in your beginning of your journey God's always right there he's a daddy that that kid has just begin to learn to walk and he's over there holding y'all Heinen he's holding you up getting you to walk right because he knows you're gonna fall he knows that he knows you're gonna fall so he's right there to pick you up so the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy seed will I give this land and they're building an altar unto the Lord first thing Abel started doing was starting what he started worshiping God he started coming to church he started getting himself into at least into some kind of religious order different than where he was at all right and then remember as you continue on up I want to get my Bible here so we can fly through this we've been through justification but just to just to look at it again because what happened was in verse 10 just like now what does a famine do remember what I said what a famine does a famine makes you do certain things number one it makes you make a decision whether to stay there or to move all right so that's what happened here God never told Abram to leave and go to Egypt which Egypt is always a type of what the world amen so Abram in his justification walk he goes right back down into the world and that could happen to you at justification remember that unclean spirits still in there thereby okay with that but you've come to a place to where you're listening to God more than you're listening to the devil all right but he can't left he left because there was a famine he had to make a decision Abram went down into Egypt and there he got into a lot of trouble first thing he did start lying he lied about his wife he said I'll tell them you're my sister so you saved my it didn't matter if he was fixing to give us what give his wife to the king of Egypt he was trying to save me me Amen that Burt you remember what happened and look how much God was watching over Abram see because remember Abram didn't truly have a revelation at the time that he was going to have that promised child with Sarah right God just told him you're gonna have a promise son and you're gonna do this and I'm gonna do this and he never really ain't listen in your walk with God when you first start your walk with God you don't get a whole lot of details the details come later do you understand what I'm saying you didn't first time you got justified you didn't walk in the church and know about the seven seals and the seven plagues and in the vials and the Daniel 70 weeks and uh you were just struggling to be a Christian because you still had that old black dog in there working on you and it was deep inside and God's out here trying to motivate you to get rid of that one that's on the inside all right everybody got that saved man so he had Sarah now remember it's Abram which is hi father but now God's tell him he's going to be a father of many nations something's got to change same thing with Sarah Sarah means contentious and boy she was there for a while I would have been too if my husband would have said hey I'm gonna lie to save my skin you gonna go down there with that Egyptian guy and you gonna marry him but you know what God preserved Sarah because he knew she couldn't her womb couldn't be messed up until that promised son same way with the womb of your mind the womb of your heart and all the things we did God's preservative we just didn't know it yet we just didn't know it we know it now that's like brother Branham said brother down said the other day there's that was some little something even if you did something wrong while you were doing the thing wrong you had something inside of you to say God why am i doing this why am I continue to go back and do this why because the one motive did you to do it still there we got to get rid of that guy and that's why I Abram had to get rid of lot a lot Abram had to get rid a lot he had to begin to separate himself because this is a Walt between you and God not you and your friend and God because your friends always gonna turn you away from God your other old friends you understand what I mean we're not we're sure we're friends here humanly well but we're brothers and sisters we're part of the same family so we're family members helping family members not friends helping friends they'll be okay with that okay cuz your friends would get you in trouble look all down through the Bible all the friends that got people in trouble all right but we are sons and daughters of God and we've come to a place to where God has revealed itself to us not making us a special people but we are special people because God made us that way we didn't we didn't make us this way God made us this way and man they're okay with that now let's go to chapter 13 when he continues on Abram finally gets out of Egypt there you go just keep scrolling well you got to get to chapter 13 mm-hmm there you go Anderson and Abram went out of Egypt finally the Lord got him out of Egypt but he took lot with him again so he took a lot with him amen a neighbor one was very rich somewhere down the line same way with you and I now we know he was physically rich but you and I are getting richer and richer in God even in our justification can you not remember in your journey you're going man why are all these blessings piling up on me and I know some people going well I never got any blessings well I don't know if you got justified or not because you know what you began your walking God was right there remember that babies right hearing gods walking right here he's not out got you out under yet he's got you right here he's watching over everything you do and he smacks your hand every once in a while and that's okay that's why you come to church get your hand smacked and all that other stuff my brother Dale always says if I'm stepping on your toes move your toes grief kind of simple and Abram was very rich so in other words God blessing Abram cuz you told him I'm gonna bless you he told Abram I'm going to bless thee so you starting your Christian journey God will bless you abundantly ma'am all right so anyway he goes on eternally journey he goes to Bethel which is what house of God so he starts going to church and that's the best thing today okay and Abram called on the name of the Lord in verse 4 what's verse 6 and the land was not able to bear them who lot and Abram that they were both getting very wealthy alright and Abram comes down and says look my angels are fighting with your devils may I say that go labor look it's Abraham's herdsmen is not between Abram and lot it's between Abraham's cattle and the herdsmen of lots cattle the herdsmen of Abram so in other words listen hadn't you ever realized I was think about this so they had never realized so when God started dealing with you the devil didn't leave he was right there with you and he was bringing his abundance of demons and God was bringing his angels with the blessings and you know there's that constant contact I just got a revelation we must tell the devil he's got to practice social separation yeah well the government has told us six-feet we wished but in other words there's a fight going on through your whole journey we know that even now there's a fight going on but I hope it's a lot more angels than a lot less demons amen he said I don't know about God said he'd take care of his kids did you know man joy took care of Abram even during all this and Abram said unto lot let there be no strife I pray thee between me and D in between my herdsmen as I heard well we'd be brethren it's not the whole land before us in other words what did he do he told him he said look you picked the best ground I'll take what's left and then what happened was what lifted up his eyes and Locke looks at the green pastures and the plains of Sodom and this two nice City sitting down there and lot chose him all the plains of Jordan in lot journeyed East and they separated themselves one from another now lot heads down to eat heads down to Sodom and Gomorrha Abram does not go with him Abram there's a separation so in justification during the time of justification when you're walking with God there's things that's got to start being cut off that you even though you may still have that root of bitterness of that or that evil spirit inside of you attached to that soul that you have you still got to have come to a place to where you have to say look I don't want to do that no more I'm going in that direction you going in that direction devil I'm going in this direction so anyway Abram got rid of a lot so then where did Abram what he dwelled in the land of Canaan now that's the Promised Land and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain pinched his tip towards Sodom but the men who sought him we know what happened they were wicked but now what do you do now look and the Lord capital L capital o kept our capital D the Lord centered to Abram that's God speaking directly to Abram and says after that lot was separated so see God's fixing that God didn't talk to him in that forum until he got a lot out of the way and then when he got a lot out of the way God comes look after that lot was separated from him lift up thine eyes and look from that place where thou art northward southward and eastward they shouldn't said eastward because you give east toward the to lot God don't worry about that God don't worry about that God said Abram you're my chosen guy you look north south east and west I don't care if locks down there I don't care sergeant down out start them done I'm fixing to change the whole deal you're gonna possess the whole place remember he told him wherever the sole of your feet for all the which now said to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever not seeds seed and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed be numbered arise walk through the land what is footprints possession footprints of the righteous or ordered of the Lord everywhere Abraham walked Abram at this time and Abram move this removed this tent and came and dwelt in the plains of Mamre which is in Hebron and built there another altar now remember he's building altars to God now remember in Genesis 14 that there was a battle happen and then we just see the jest of it so we'll go to chapter 15 start with sanctification again but chapter 14 Abram goes and saves lot from dying which is the brotherly thing to do but what happens is this God is remember one thing's for sure they kept trying to get a give Abram all this stuff back remember all the kings down at the bottom all the kings says hey I want to give you this I want to give it Abram said nope God has separated me I see old friends are coming back going amen we're gonna have a beer party Saturday night 8 o'clock so you come you don't have to drink you have to stay away from that because you're separating yourself Abram you're not gonna walk like that anymore you're not gonna get caught up in that anymore you're not going to go back into Egypt anymore with the kind of attitude you had when the first time you went so Abram does this great thing and what happens in verse 18 is Melchizedek which is a man not a spirit Melchizedek is a person a man he met Abram coming back from the slaughter of the kings and what happened he give communion to them and he said bless you blessed him and said blessed be Abram even in justification after all the line and cheating and all the lot that you brought with you I'm telling you what God said about John because those who he's justified he's already glorified God knows this whole journey of your own you just don't know it but you better depend on God because if God blesses you blessed be Abram blessed be put your name in there because you're walking in the journey that God has asked you to walk in and he's going to bless you blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the Most High God which has delivered thine enemies into thy hands and he gave him tithes of all and then then the kings have thought him they're trying to give him all this stuff back and he said I'm knowing I don't even want a shoe latch it I don't wanna listen when you start in this Christian walk all you needs God all you need is God you don't need an old friend to come to your house especially on Sunday afternoon right before you read go church yeah had a guy come by the other day and he was a jobber witness I'll say that online that's okay but it's about 4:30 on Wednesday afternoon well I walked out and I couldn't you know I hey how you doing what's your name he told me his name I said what do I say what do we what can I do for you today he said well I want to tell you about the world I knew is Jehovah Witness because he had the pamphlet anything and I said look buddy I said if you can say what you got

would you know the devil does that even God will let the devil text you seeing somebody will house about 5:15 on Wednesday afternoon yeah and I can't believe this things happen you know things happen to right before church yeah 6 days nothing happens Sunday morning something happened well I ain't God that's all them kings of Sodom tryin to give you something and you know what do like Abram I don't need that I'm going on sir I don't need that I'll deal with it when I get home I'll deal with him when I get to when I get back even brother branham remember only one of the services we just listened to that's what he's talking about he said what do you mean they said we're gonna oh we prayed for his mother or somebody was in the hospital remember they sent to knows his mother right he said god bless her and he said but I've got something I got to do hear the words more important now whoever you would say that if your mother was in the hospital brother branham's your example right okay our cat gets the sniffles and we stay home and it's usually on Sunday morning yeah are you kids who come over on Sunday afternoon about 2:00 yeah anyway that's not God doing that though that's the devil we should be enough to know that that's the devil doing that that's not God but you know what that's in our journey because if ascent of Abraham's journey is gonna be an hour journey where the kings of Sodom are going to try to give you all kind of stuff on Saturday and Wednesday hey man but he said all I want is what my young men of Eden and the portion of men went with went with me so what he's he's he's you know he's getting taking care of his people but he said I don't want to know that let them take their portion in other words what God is your portion God is the one that gives you your portion let's read one less now let's go to Roman's 3 if you can brothers I'm gonna take my time this afternoon we usually get out of 4 o'clock then all right because I want to get finished with it I want to get to the baptism the whole ago being justified freely by His grace remember that's not you justifying yourself you justify yourself you're always going to go wrong being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation for picture and through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness not yours the remission of sins that are past remember we don't need we don't need forgiveness for sins for tomorrow we don't know what they are that's Catholicism we don't want that but we know what we did yesterday we know what we did this morning God forgive me of my sins that are past through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just now he's not might be he is just alright that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus so I want the justifier to look at me and say you're just because of me you're just Ezekiel 11 verse 17 and we're going to hang with this one all the way up to the Holy Ghost because this should explain and help us it's explained how God deals with us as a Christian Ezekiel Evans says therefore thus saith the Lord I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries now what's he doing he's bringing us out what is redemption Redemption bringing out right coming out of the world and going into Christ all right mm-hmm and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered and I will give you the land of Israel and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things here we go we're walking not he's taking away all the detestable things in our life thereby got that day man therefore and all the abominations therefore from thence and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you now remember you might say that's the Holy Spirit but I remember we had a prophet of God to help us understand what the Bible is talking about that that is not the Holy Spirit that is a new spirit that we're going to look at in sanctification that is a new spirit to put you in a religious order or to get you higher up with God and to get that unclean spirit out of you because what is sanctification cleaned and set aside not put in service but cleaned and set aside to be put into service there got that and I will give them one heart then I will put a new spirit within you and I will take out what that old stony rebellious sinful heart that was so stoning you know that's like this you can't you can't move it but God said I'm gonna give you a heart of flesh what a heart of flesh is real pliable it's able God is able to mold you as the Potter molds the clay you can't start molding clay out of a rock right you have to have soft clay to mold with so god softens us up and that's what he's doing remember and remember in our Christian journey you remember how that you always feel the sweetness of God he said well don't you know well know as much as I did sorry God just wants you to walk sometimes and believe but you're starting your journey in mind everything made you cry song to make it cry preacher to make it cry you know somebody talking to you about the Lord you just are crying why because God is softening up that old stony heart that you had before same way with Abram Abram you're Abram he's what he's walking us through something that we're not used to because remember we were born in sin shaping the iniquity spousal my mother's womb we came here a liar we came here with that old Adamic nature that old nature that got that Satan gave us because of the fall because of our carnal mind it was attached to us from our birth first thing kid does is lies they'll steal they'll do all kind of stuff as a kid not knowing even you as we're like you walking in God but he's got to take that old stony heart out and put a heart of flesh in there now not a true heart transplant but it is a heart the heart of you is the center the heart of an apple is the core so the core of you or the heart of you is being changed amen so now in sanctification let's go now to Hebrews 2 verse 11 let's read these and then we'll get into what he's talking about because I came across a little something I should have brought out the other I didn't for both he that sanctify and they who are sanctified now what is sanctified it's a compound meaning cleaned and set aside for service alright it has two meanings two cleaned because the Bible tells you sanctified brother Dale ready this morning by the washing of the water of the word alright they who are sanctified the saint sorry let's read again for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are olive one cuts brought you into a closer relationship to him to her in brother Brahim codes a religious order for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying I would declare thy name unto thy brethren in the midst of the church while I sing praises unto thee now let's read Ezekiel 36 and then we'll go to then brothers go to Genesis 15 1 after we read this I will take from you among the heathen and gather you out of the countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water now look we're at Ezekiel 11 it told us he was taking the stony heart out putting the heart of flesh in he goes further now in Ezekiel 36 says basically the same thing in verse 24 24 verse 24 then will I sprinkle clean water upon you he brings in water and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you now back in there now look and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of flesh basically the same thing but now he's saying I'm gonna put a new spirit within you alright and you look in the Bible you see where the Bible says the unclean spirit goes out of a man walks in dry places seek your threat what he's coming out of your inward house out of your inward house out of that heart that we've been talking about that now there's a new spirit put in there and we're gonna read what brother Branham says about that but let's get into sanctification with with Abram chapter 15 let's go see the journey of Abram now remember this is Abram and after these things after you've come out of justification you should know when you enter into sanctification because that unclean spirit goes out you have new desires you have new feelings you have you have more of a want to to do the right thing because all that's gone now you should feel like that and I told you in my journey of sanctification I believe I was forgiven of my sins but I went back to the water to be baptized now the water has nothing to do with it physically if I understand that even on the internet that physical water can't wash your sins away the blood of Jesus Christ is the only thing that wash your sins away but you do like he said in Ezekiel I'm gonna clean you up by the washing of the water of the word in the New Testament but then he says he's gonna wash you with clean water what what is clean water clean water is what you hear did you hear clean this out there no you did not hear cleanness in the world no the only thing you hear clean is here I'm not saying this building but in when you come into reading your Bible studying the message of the hour coming in here and preaching coming in here the messages that's clean water that's water that is washing you and you should feel I felt I had to I felt I need to be read baptized so I went we went to the bar to the water in January which was quite warm but anyway when I came out of the water man I just tingled all over and I felt so empty you said you feel empty yeah I felt empty at that time because your your symbolism of water baptism as you die and whatever goes down there you need to leave down there I don't want if you come back up with the same thing you went down with you just got wet physically but if you say God I'm gonna go and I'm going to that's why how many times have I told you what do we do when we go to baptizing we're going to a funeral something's gotta we're gonna bury them in Baptism and can't bring them up in what the Bible say newness of life and walk in newness of life that's what Abram was doing he started walking after these things the word of the Lord capital L Ord that theophany came unto Abram in a vision now he's showing him a vision he's expanding his sight now he's come to him in a vision fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abram said Lord God what will they'll give me seeing I go childless he's reminding God of what he promised him oh I like that brother Brahma he tells us many times he said God don't mind you reminding him of his promises he likes for you to remind him of what he's already said about us he loves for you to quote the Bible I don't think he likes me to quote anything else you know quote quote the promises back to him what will that give me seeing I go childless because remember in your journey as Abram you become a Christian you start doing the things of God but you theirs you don't understand all the intricacies of of how Jesus came and preached and you just know that he died for your sins right we're not we're not worth theologians when we walk in justification and part of sanctification now words are struggling to stay alive and then we're just struggling to understand that's why Jesus said he said come unto me all ye that labor heavy laden and I'll give you rest I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ the scripture says and thou shalt be saved that's pretty simple but remember Abram has to become Abraham because the promise that was a promise give to Abram but I'm gonna read you here in a minute where God gives a promise to Abraham and at that point Abraham knows the whole story then because God just told him get up and move I'm gonna bless you I'm gonna blot it you gonna have a lot of children he never told him where he was going to end up he never told him it was going to be with Sarah not Sarah Enoch God never told him that why don't want to pile all this on top of you he knows you're human he knows you're gonna have problems in life so you're not gonna load you up with anything but blessings to begin with but now remember that's a certain time in your life that God's gonna come to you and say look take that promise kid that I give you and you take him up on that mountain and you sacrificing that's your only promise son take thy son thine only son Abraham and take him up there what find out if you're obedient enough to continue this journey we'll get into that with with adoption but we got to get through just Fanta fication here it's only two o'clock we just starting service and man we're here too for anyway so anyway and all the people at home are going why does it matter put on some more coffee get the popcorn out and that's really ok as long as you listen and Abram said Lord God want will thou give me seeing I go childless in the steward of my houses this eliazar of damascus memory Eliezer comes up and helps him in the process of finding a bride hello freising so Eleazar he's saying oh I've got this Eliezer I but that's all I got but remember this le ESR is going to find a bride for Isaac later on in the journey so let's don't forget that Eliezer and Abram said Behold to me thou it's given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir but it wasn't his because look he says behold the word of the Lord came to him saying this shall not be thine heir I'm not talking about this one that old nature you were born with that old house that thing that lived in you you gotta get rid of that's not your heir hey man the Bible tells us that you will not be part of the bondwoman you'll be part of the free woman the free woman was Sarah which is going to be turning to Sarah behold the word Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine but he that shook already called him he he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels Shelby's on there so now Abram says it's gonna come from me it's not something born in my house it's not any of my old friends or my old devil it's gonna come out of me what'd I tell you the other day the Bible says out of your belly will flow rivers of living water the one coming out of their own bowels bowel shopping but I remember he didn't say it's gonna be with Sarah either it that's that point so he's given he's given Abram revelation just like he's given to us a little at a time hey man there's a lot of things we don't understand but now we should be able to understand it now in our Christian walk we should be Abraham able to understand what's going on and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven he keeps showing this to Abram that look all this whole world is yours if thou be able to number him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and who is that he that he is God counted it to Abram for righteousness even in my journey of sanctification I'm coming to a place that God is reminding me of all the promises that he started out with amen I am the Lord that brought you how many times has God even now and I hope we do that now even even as we're not all assembled I hope though he has taken you back he has taken me back to my journey when I began to make sure that I'm okay God knows he's okay but I want to make sure I'm okay I want to check up a little bit Abram look back it's okay to look back to see that let's don't look back and want to go back Abram didn't go back he looked back but the Lord said look I'm the Lord that brought thee out of the earth the Chaldees and of course that's the first thing God spoke to him was while he was right there to give thee this land he had to call him out to get him to this land to inherit it and he said Lord God mm-hmm whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old now what's he doing now watch we remember what brother Brown said about this this whole journey of Abram has got to come to a place that when you get into sanctification and we'll read it a little bit but I'm gonna read this that Abram is gonna have to learn to make sacrifices that he didn't learn to make Abram is gonna have to learn and and look what he does he takes a heifer of three years old and if she go to three years old remember if she goat is used for an ignorance offering I've got that in my Bible and I really like that because even if you you plead ignorance God says you still got a sacrifice you got to do numbers verse numbers 15 verse 27 says that is an ignorance offering you bring a she-goat to offer him and a ram of three years old brother Graham said look at the threes Turtledove and a young pigeon a Turtledove and a pigeon was given because of healing you'll hear that brother bran will tell us that it took a prophet to tell us that how you gonna do that for you to keep looking at like that but the healing of the Turtledove and a young pigeon is is they didn't tear it apart now they totally twisted the head off but it was because of healing and we'll look at that in just a little bit and he took him to him all these and divided them in the mist and laid each piece one against another but two Birds divided he not and that's where brother berm tells us - for the divine healing showing divine healing can come your broken body can be healed alright and when the fowls came down now love there's going to be fowls come back into your life can we say foul spirits those were fo ul but with a little play of words this the fowls came down in Abram what Abram being in his journey he drove them away why because remember in sanctification the unclean spirit goes out but now the Bible tells you the unclean spirit goes out walks and drop place seek his rest find its nun that's in Luke I believe it is will somebody help me with it that's in the Book of Luke somewhere in this into Testaments and then that unclean spirit is going to come back that foul old spirit is going to come right back and try to enter in and it says enter into my house because God has a possessed you yet you've been possessed still by the devil but it's going out of there and he divided them into myths and when the files came down Abram drove him away and when the Sun was going down brother I'm sitting in the evening time a deep sleep fell upon Abram and a horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram now this is while Abram is in a deep sleep and he said unto Abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs now we know that he's telling us now that that is Israel there's going to be 400 years in the land of Egypt everybody got that same man but but how can we spiritually apply that you and I your seed shall be in a strange land listen when you get born again everything out there strange so he's heading toward insane - even in sanctification when the unclean spirit goes out you don't act like that unclean spirit no more and all these things are strange in the world they're just strangers ain't that right I hope in your life you know one thing for sure that under when you got sanctified by the washing of the water of the word every Sunday and every winds and every time you match-play and every time you converse with your brothers and sisters that God is washing you and that those fowls are being driven out but now we're talking about the inside guy right now and we're talking about God giving you a new spirit to be able to even talk to God we'll get to that in just a minute where brother BAM tells us now so he's so look you're gonna be a stranger in a land that's not yours there's I mean and shall serve them and they shall afflict in 400 years that's when physical Israel went down to Egypt and within bondage for 400 years and then that nation whom I serve I'll judge and then he keeps going on down but look right here verse 17 it came to pass that when the Sun went down and it was dark and behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed through those pieces remember that light that light from watch what the prophet of God tells us but your brother Brahim tells us and that's true God even in justification but in sanctification God still going well you deserve hell what you've done you deserve help you're not my child yet yeah you're you're my child in my mind I know that but you don't know that seeing God's mind he knew exactly what Abraham was going to do at the end of his journey but Abram did not because Abram standing there going I'm Abram I've got a wife I've lived with for 60 something years she's barren we've had relations for all that length the time when we've never had a kid right and I'm supposed to be that you can't count it for the sand on the sea you can't count my hairs and I've got one heir and this Eliezer and he wasn't even born from me because the way he was looking at his Abram was going to give his ownership till Eleazar because he did have a children that's what he just said back up there we'll be ready my heir that was born in my own house well it was born of a servant I guess it wasn't born of him but anyway look in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying look watch he comes right back and says unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river of the river Euphrates the key nuts and the ice and the ice and the ice and the amur ox and the jebusites and like I said Sundays and the web sites all right so now here's the point that I want to make real quick what does Sarah I mean Sarah means contentious all right she's a contentious woman and watch what happens in your walk of sanctification when the unclean spirit goes out the devil they're still gonna talk to you so we're gonna make Sarah the devil because the devil heard God tell you about a plan right yes right in that beginning he said I'm gonna bless you and I'm gonna give you children and I'm gonna give you this and not in the other well sir I must have got a different revelation then what God had a man because she's going look she had a handmaid an Egyptian now this ain't part of the plan this is the permissive wheel coming in not the perfect will of God perfect will of God Abram didn't know company was still able I'm telling you when you get born again you should know the perfect will of God now whether you do it or not George cause but but now under sanctification you really don't you may say I'm gonna do this and I think this is the right thing to do and I'm gonna go down this path and you go remember God's nose are the best yeses you'll ever get all right cuz if God tells you no he knows that if you go past here you're gonna really mess up so reevaluate what you've been thinking and go in another direction that's physically in that or naturally in spirit but when you're born again we should not have these if you look in this whole bottom line of this look at Abram he just really don't know where to go he don't have a rudder he's got a boat he's got water but he don't have a rudder what's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is our rudder if it moves this way that's the way you move he didn't have that rudder yet he's kind of just fumbling through life and then all of a sudden his beautiful wife says I got it figured out we need to go in that direction and she's so convincing that Abram says ok right so self-centered to Abraham behold now the LORD have to restrain me from bearing she's telling she just like the devil the devil blames the Lord on everything you know the devil don't blame himself listen the devil don't say I made you do that no he said now now listen didn't happen in the garden Eve Eve I know you got a blessing I was there when Genesis one came apart there when God said let us make man in our own image and have dominion over the sin let's multiply replenish the earth same spirit was on Sarah well I got this new program Abram Adam here's the way we need to do it cuz they don't look like we're getting anything done right here and that the way it has been in your life a lot of times my life I know it's been that way you sit there and grind your wheels and you get nowhere why because it's not the perfect will of God if we're look the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord if you go in one direction and you're just sitting there spinning your wheels goes different way that may not be the perfect will of God but like brother Dale says long a long time ago God will let you work under permissive well because you're a free moral agent but there's somewhere it's got to work back to the perfect because this right here works right back to the perfect will of God he uses the same two people he doesn't switch players he uses the same Abram and Sarah to turn them into Abraham and Sarah to bring forth the promise but right here we get a little bit mixed up in sanctification because we hadn't got that rudder the Holy Ghost the guide brother Graham coaches the guide right because the Bible says he'll lead you and guide you into all truth I'm gonna send you the Holy Ghost right mm-hmm and Sarah I sent a neighbor behold now the LORD hath restrained me from bearing blame don't Lord I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I may obtain children by her no that's not the promise but God allowed it to happen what to bring something in called Ishmael because you always got to have good and evil watch and Sarah Abraham's wife took Hagar her made and she was in an Egyptian brought a little of the world back in huh after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan oh he was enjoying it self no of a sudden the devil comes back in because the unclean spirit going out and now he's coming back that was the devil's listen the devil is a master at manipulation a master he says okay I can't work this way out but I got a little gap that's what brother Graham said about Eve he found that little gap he found her little weakness and he went right to it same way with this Dussehra she's telling Abram now look after he'd been ten years in the land of Canaan and gave her to husband Abram to be his wife and he went in unto her and she conceived when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes now look Sarah brings this is how the devil works he brings in his plan and he gives you his plan okay and it works but he's not satisfied with that Sarah outstandings Abraham my wrong be upon thee I think she's listened to be real on it I think physically she's getting back at him for sending her to Egypt to try to marry the Hitchin you know shipping her off my wrong be upon me I have given my maiden to thy bosom in which she saw this she had conceived I was despised in her eyes the Lord judge between me and thee but Abram said look Abram said unto Sarah behold I made as in thy hand do to her as it pleases thee and when Sarah dealt hardly what she did she sent her out she separated hmm but now remember the angel of the Lord didn't forget this Union a permissive will there was a child brought forth and then after a long time we see that Abram become Abraham he even says oh that Ishmael may live before you he still don't have the full revelation of the word just like all of us we don't have the full revelation of the word yet but we're walking right all right so any way to save time that's let's go to verse 12 now this is the promise God God tone said look he'll be a wild man his hand will be against every man that's over there now brother you know this talks about Iran and Iraq and the different ones that's Ishmael's kids they're always against the promise kids or Israel the natural promise his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren and she called the name of the Lord just spoken now Garden City have a okay we're for the well was called whatever that is and hagar bear abraham a son and abraham called his abraham's one and named him Ishmael yes and Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bare Ishmael de Braun for score four to eight eighty six years old when Hagar bare Ishmael Abraham Abram now look Genesis 17 tell you what let's stop breath in let's read what brother Aaron says about this real quiz everybody ok we all right nobody's trying to fall asleep yet if you'll stick a big enough piece of candy in your mouth we may have to pray for you for choking but you won't go to sleep alright look let's go to quote number two you're good there you go what's close now that he's explaining what brother what brother Abram is going through now he calls him Abraham but remember he's still Abram what's close now then when he came down the Holy Spirit to talk to Abram in the garden out there where he was laying on the hill he put Abram to sleep no Abraham or Abram you haven't got one thing to do alright you lay here now and Abram went to sleep you're out of the picture and next thing now what's God to do he's confirming and giving an evidence because remember when he waked sabor him up he still tells him I'm making a covenant between us hey you got to do these things right here listen excuse me listen if you want to be healed how he's gonna do it then Abram then Abram I'm shutting you out of the picture I'm putting you to sleep then before Abraham came a black thickness every sinner deserves to go to hell blackness then after that of smoking burning furnace every sinner deserves Abraham that's what you deserve but beyond that one a little white light now like I said last Sunday that's that little white light that follows you all the days of your life remember redeemed have angels you don't know us there and boy some of the things I did he probably like brother Brown said he blessed a lot but he was there guiding you because God knows what you gonna do God knows you're gonna continue on or he know she's not you're gonna continue on and he'll just leave God we're all were special people but we all came the same way we all had the same experience we all came to so we all had to make a choice to become a Christian I couldn't help but being a Christian some people say uh I was a little different that and if you're really dig down into their life yeah they had them they had that one day Abram had to choose to stay there with life or send that lot out of here same way with right here guard it now God's saying to Abram I'm fixing to do the work you're not gonna your your works or nothing because God's the one that's doing this Abram that's what you deserve but beyond that one a little white light that little white light went right between those pieces of sacrifice because remember a sanctification is cleaned and set aside for service what made is real clean the sacrifices a man the sacrifices is what made Israel clean and that's what he's under now he's showing him though that that white light is still there the white light moving showing making a confirmation and I believe it and you look in your journey of sanctification as God comes closer to you he does confirm a lot of things he confirms the covenant that he made with you all right making a confirmation showing to Abram that he would do someday through his seed Isaac bringing in Christ for the supreme sacrifice everybody got that say man alright number three this is the hidden life in Christ you've seen people that was nice but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around them there's something about them they got a creative power around them it just seems to be different I'd like to stop here if it was possible and tell you some things on that you're a little creator yourself and you are because what he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't God's Spirit that's your spirit God gives you a new spirit then he says I'll put my spirit in him but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit to make your nature a little more gentle now I'm not completely burning down because God hadn't come in there yet remember you're cleaned and set aside not put in service the jar has still got the lid off so that unclean spirit can go right back down in that jar but when God seals you by the Holy Ghost he seals itself in and seals the jar all right then he puts you in service like brother Brown said you see that where brother Brown said a preacher should not be preaching without being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Wow how about that Wow but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you now remember he's fixing to dwell inside of you not with you inside you so he's got to get you fixed up now you can't do that that's what he was telling Abram you can't fix yourself up I'm going to just lay you down and kill you alright so he has to get you fixed up before he can come in I'll give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed so you can entertain him right when you were in the bars when you were all doing the things of the world you weren't entertaining God you're entertaining the other guy all right all right number four Intervale I love this I love this message notice you put a new spirit God had to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him Wow you can't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you we all had one yeah yeah and you got to remember when that leaves - I think you better cause you unclean spirits gotta go remembered Dwight Moody says God will fill those who are not full of theirself all right so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen I will put a new spirit in them and I will put my spirit in them now that's what we're fixing to talk about now in a minute with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said after he's given you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with God's Spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you hmm if he ever gives it to you so that's what you do when you come under sanctification that's okay you can go on when you come up to sanctification you you become brother Graham says it's a religious order what you become more religious or more wanting to do what God tells us to do all right because you unclean spirits driving and driven out but now look it's like brother Dale was saying this morning I've always said this that is the that is the most dangerous place you can be because look if Abram would have said if everyone would have woke up from that vision and said okay God I'm all right I'm just gonna stay right here and I'm gonna keep Sarah and Hagar and Ishmael and this is the promise and Satan's going yeah man you feel good you got the right you know you still got your wife and you're still got you still going to the same church and you still got the same pastor and you believe the message because brother Branham was a prophet and we believe we can recite Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 the devil loves that boy out the devil hates is is that he can't get back in that inner guy God's got it sealed and he can't get back in and then you come to another level of now that God's gonna meet you and you're gonna have to do something that really hurts the bay okay we're all we're all men here today we know what circumcision is and and he had circumcision at 90 something years old so so but but now that's a type of us though coming to a place to where you you got to make a decision all that old skin that oh what a demmick so let's read that now let's go to Genesis chapter 17 that's ok maybe about 30 more minutes is everybody all right we okay we're not not even supper time yet I'm sorry for those of you online we don't eat dinner at 6 o'clock it wasn't called the Lord's dinner it was called the Lord's Supper and it was in the evening ok it's the weave supper o southerners have always been rocked we did hey man we eat dinner in the middle of the day we eat supper at night College it was the Lord's Supper not the Lord's dinner whatever that had to do with anything it just probably made some people mad Genesis chapter 17 verse 1 now look and when Abram was ninety years old in 999 years old you think you're too old for God to deal with you know I don't think so and listen truly why did if he's the father by faith and he's the one that we're supposed to look at why did God let him go ninety nine years before he comes into this new birth that we're talking about why do you let you get thirty years old well I'm just saying what he let you get twenty-five years why do you let remember this and I when I see this I always remember when brother Branham went across the curtain of time and that woman came up and hugged his neck and said my precious brother and said the angel looked at him and said don't you remember her well I mean he really no he didn't remember him remember her because she was 90 something years old when she got saved in his meeting she was a 90 something year old woman probably all you know / but now she was a brand-new young woman I think about that you know that my whole jar yeah come to the Lord he'll give you a new birth and when she received that new birth that 90 something years old she was just as young as she was when she walked across the curtain of time and hugged that prophet's neck at 18 to 20 years old I wish we'd realize that that when we received the new birth that changes us in our soul that changes us everybody back to the same age 18 to 20 years old we're all young that's why we should be vibrant inside whether our body hurts or not we should be inside as brother Dale says a revival now his revival is not in that 80 year old body my 60 year old body the revival is the inside guy denying what the outside yeah but God to show example to all of us he let Abram live a good long life before he brings him to circumcision and when Abram was ninety and nine years old there's bear with me a few minutes the Lord appeared appeared to Abram now remember a capital LRD appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before and they never told him to be perfect before because he cuz he couldn't and you can't but he is now requiring to walk before me and be thou perfect or in other words I'm gonna bring you to come this completion of bringing this promise to pass everybody got that because he told him I will way back yonder when he was like 70 years old he said I I will do this I will do that I will do this but I watch he comes right back in Genesis 17 and starts all over and verse 6 we'll get to in a minute hang right there I will I will I will I will listen if God's not doing this it's not worth it come on people if God's not doing this all it's not worth it cuz he who's doing it there's only two spirits we don't want to be religious at this time now we want to be a boring in son and daughter of God we don't want to be religious religious people are going go to hell because what is a religion mean covering we don't want to make our own cover and that's what got Adam and Eve in trouble they made their own religion of their own covering God took his covering rip the skins off of them lambs and throw them in there said look that ain't enough clothes you got on put this on so I'm when you get born again women and men you'll put on clothes not take them off and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my covenant between me and thee and I will multiply thee exceedingly hoytsman watch him now to me I'm gonna be a little more dramatic because God is listen when you come to the new birth to me that's I believe God rejoices more when you receive him the inward man his spirit then he did when he created the world because he created the world knowing that if he didn't create the world you couldn't be standing here today and receive the new birth so I believe that's his joy tell my somebody screaming and shouting remember the Bible says they rejoiced a man they rejoice and I'm sure he had a good time making all the stars and everything but what was he making them for his motive his last part his whole motive was making that so they can come inside of you that's why one that's why we need to see what brother Dale was talking about he's coming the son of man physically flesh man is not going to be on the earth he's physically flesh man in your earth the son of man is the collective body of Jesus Christ and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us I'm talking about that today so now watch God's gonna get some dramatic here and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee now thou shalt be a father of many nations now he told him that long time before but he's fixing to what reveal how he's going to do it neither shall thy name any more be called Abram hi Father but thy name shall be Abraham in other words your name was whatever it was sinner now I'm gonna make you a saint or a Christian that's our new name brother I'm told us what our new name was we're mrs. Jesus Christ now listen you don't want a different name before this happened to you you were satisfied with people going hey Louise let's go have a beer but see when they picked the phone um says hey Louise let's go have a beer now Lewis goes ain't at home I don't know who that guy in right I don't know who that guy is you and you don't that thoughts not even in your mind a man neither shalt thou name any more be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father what does Abraham mean what father of many nations because look folks when you're walking even in justification and sanctification brother Branham says you don't even preach until you get baptized but he said don't preach until you've had that back side of the desert experience which is the new birth listen and I'm gonna say this and I ain't I ain't gonna back down one bit we got a lot of preachers in this message that are just sanctified that they think they got the Holy Ghost because they got this and that and the other feeling or brother branham I'm just saying because you can't preach and continue on in the life they're in that's what I'm saying watch the life brother Brent says always watch the life the life takes them away more away more away from God all these people to think you can have polygamy and that's what the message is all about and you have all these things that's not they can't be born again that's not say listen now that's not saying though you can't get caught in error but you got to come out cuz God promised you you would walk in truth but I believe people are in the sanctified condition think they got the Holy Ghost and God shows them truth and they turn it down that makes them worse Jesus Jesus and not get anything Lord have I not come and cast out Devils spoken preach the gospel Judas what Judas is gonna walk up and say hey you give me a spirit to preach and cast out Devils and Jesus is gonna say but you denied me you were doing good until that because all these others you know even you know it's kind of strange because the devil always argue so so Judas is gonna say well now you call Peter devil you call Peter said Satan get out of me Peter denied you're three times but you know what God's gonna tell him Peter went to Pentecost Peter went and receive what I was telling you I was going to send you if you would have waited long enough i'ma give it to you same way with all of us that's why the Bible says depart from me I never knew you that word kne w is not knowing that's new as in relationship between Adam knew his wife Eve so that's an intimate relationship of intercourse amen and that's what we're doing we're having intercourse with what's the problem with with us saying we have intercourse with Jesus Christ but what the problem is is people go well I'm making love with Jesus Christ and it's not him it's the devil right that's what they're doing that's why you come up and say Lord if I not cast out devils in other words have I not Jesus said no you never need me you might a knew of me you might have got sanctified but you let that unclean spirit come back in you and drive you in another direction I don't know how I got off on that but not somebody needed it maybe neither shall thy name anymore be called sinner but thy name shall be called Christian because look in Abram how many children did he have one wild kid right one wild kid that's the same way you and me but when you get born again look at the spiritual multiplication of getting born again once you get born again have the right birth have the right child you can stand behind the pulpit preachers you can go to work laity and you can produce children of God but God's not gonna let you do that in sanctification because the seeds not there it's coming but it's not there yet sure you can talk about God but remember I remember a lot of times I tried to explain a lot of things about the message and I knew I was sanctified I knew I hadn't received in your birth but I can't put things together because they'd ask you a question you go I don't got to the Prophet take homework I don't work well in explain this one gun in a prophet no you gotta have your own revelation so Abraham Abram is now getting a revelation from God that I can do it now and he's gonna tell him who is he gonna do it with with his bride the right bride hey man let's brides brides churches hey guards hey guards and a guard but they'll come one bride Sarah and you're gonna have the promised child neither shall thy name any more be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father that just makes me feel good when you see you know Abraham's kind of blunt kind of Abram but when you say Abraham brother Graham said he gave Abram part of his name the ham the am the I am Jehovah and all that you know Abraham one two three four five six seven letters now man now Abram is five that's okay but seven is completion five is Grace listen you walk under grace even still now but you really walk under grace under justification sanctification cuz you make a lot of mistakes and God has grace for you but now there's a time when it's gonna look at you just like your daddy did one time and said son grow up and Ocampo would see that big ol hen go right up inside the backi ahead that's what God does he finally says hey he's gonna do it to you he's gonna hey yeah I got watch what he did to Abram he's hey you're gonna be able to him now listen to me and I will - here comes our Wells again verse 6 I told you 6 7 8 and I will make the exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of them listen I believe the tone of God's voice changed because the tone of God's voice changed when I became born-again his voice was more clear his voice was more precise his voice was more it had a lot more clarity in it and you knew God was talking to you and I will make the exceeding fruitful I'm sure guards over there Wow I'm gonna make you finally come to the place I want you to be 99 years I've been waiting on this two thousand years I've been waiting on this team shall come out of thee and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations I finally got the right people here and I seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after the end I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land we're in you're a stranger this world is not my home I'm just the passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue but guess what where's him treasures gonna fall back to right here I love our brother Brahim said Abraham was looking for a city whose builder and maker of God and he was walking right on top of them where the state is gonna step down and man you know what though he didn't have enough in Revelation he had a revelation of the time but he was looking for that place and it was right under his feet because he had took a little profit to come and say look that mountains gonna push up right where Abraham had talked about a GPS through brother Branham he told him sitting right there were the mountains gonna push up remember the Bible said the mountains gonna push you up cleave from one side of the other he said it's right there in the same spot where Abraham met Mel Cassidy right here what we're fixing to talk about very spot where that city is going to come down and that's what we're gonna live what about what about a positioning system that's God's positioning system not GPS like we have that tells you to recalculate God's never recalculated in this life and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a God unto you as I seed after thee and I will give unto thee in thy seed after thee the land where there are stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God and God said unto Abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and you shall circumcise the flesh your foreskin now remember this had to be a type of what happens in our new birth right because what God is telling them now and we know being males and if you're circumcised or not I don't mind a big difference remember that question popped up in the New Testament and Paul says it's the heart circumcision of the heart doesn't matter if you circumcision is physical or not you know here but what does that do that cuts off the foreskin are the excess flesh and it's something that Abram did God didn't circumcise Abram Abraham circumcised this up now look watch this though we're gonna put you and it shall be a token of a covenant cuz remember Abraham got a promise and then I'm going to be a little graphic here but what happens is is that separated the people all the way to Jesus this time in other words you could say were you frontal they all kind of looked alike where you from they go take them out behind the tree and Oh you're of Abraham's lineage you're of Abraham you're you're separated people right so they could physically show just like you and I now physically show not by that way but we physically showing this thing that we've had circumcision but look when it happens on the eighth day not the seventh day brother mom always explains that we're in we're all in the new birth we're in the eighth day in eternity we're in the eighth day or eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child now we know what all that is but it's the taking off of the foreskin now watch this verse eleven right here and you shall circumcise the flesh your foreskin it shall be a token because remember God couldn't enter them in the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost couldn't enter into the man in the Old Testament everybody got that but to be a separated people he let them do that in their natural foreskins so that they can be a separated people everybody got that I may about I hope everybody sees that that that's why God did that all right it was a physical showing of what lineage they would come from Abraham and his house and the lineage we come from God we show the circumcision by the circumcision of the heart what we're separated people not by the physical body because we can go walk out here in the world if we look just like the world not exactly but we do we are human men and women but what happens to us though when we when we received the new birth we start moving over this way now you don't do it you should never separate your but God separates the people okay God separates the people the excess foreskin amen so he that is eight days old so here we come where it you get circumcised on the eighth day right now it's a wonderful thing to know that that that's after seven days before seven days physically your blood doesn't have the clotting agent in it so God knew and even typed that out in your own human body and that was back then when they didn't have cauterization now they do it now where they cauterize it with with heat but back then they didn't have that well you were circumcised and you were circumcised before seven days you'd bleed out because they had no way to stop it you had no coagulation in your blood or whatever that was if Sarah was here she could tell us vitamin K or whatever that is it collects your blood you don't your body doesn't develop it till after the seventh day so God knowing that but typing everything's in the Bible putting us in the eighth day saying it has to be eight days before the man's circumcise all right every man child he just bought in the house he they just brought bought with our money much needs to be circumcised no word to everybody attached to Abraham now and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting now look it's not an eternal covenant it's an everlasting covenant because when Jesus came and Paul comes up and says look it doesn't matter if you physically circumcised or not you gotta be circumcised inside inside now that had to be an outside showing and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised look that soul shall be cut off from his people they physically didn't let that kid in the in in the religious ceremonies it meant that much to God at that time to separate them from that but look how it shows all the way down to now listen you walk through justification you walk through sanctification we see now that people is walked in sanctification they're now turning away because you can't receive the new birth as in Romans tells us you can't fall away from being born again and if there's Baptist online I'm sorry but this once saved always saying that's not right in the condition they tell you because they just tell you to you've made a decision at 10 years old that doesn't matter if you have 14 wives and drink beer and smoke cigarettes right here swear God no it's a walk god only moved on Abraham after he went through all this journey to 99 years now look they'll be cut off and have broken my covenant so if you're not born again today you've broken the Covenant of God because the Covenant of God is to promise that you will receive the baptism of Holy Ghost eternal life in your soul and God said unto Abraham as for Sarah thy wife he's not forgetting there thou shalt not call her contentious anymore but Sarah Sarah shall be her name Sarah not Sarah now look what he says about him I'm tryin to skip on through here her name is now princess but watching in verse 16 yeah and I will bless her now he's not said a word about her you hear me he's not said one word about putting her in the promise or anything he said April I'll bless you Abram I'll bless you Avery my bless you now he brings the wife in now she's been there the whole time but she was Sarah she needed a name change hey man are we getting a we getting a spiritual application of this and without going through it cuz this 256 now and I will bless her and give the son of her so here we go the promise is now God says I'm going to take you change your name Sarah you're Sarah you're now Sarah and now the promise sons going between be between the both of you and Sarah looks at him and goes I'm 99 I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations the kings of people shall come out of her then Abraham fell on his face and laughed now remember how the story goes Abraham laughs out loud at God and doesn't get in trouble but Sarah sniggers in her heart a little bit later on in the journey and brother Brown said if it wasn't for Abraham God would have killed Sarah you see how much God Revere's his promise his promise had to come through Abraham and Sarah not sinner Lewis Christian Lewis not sinners AK car snuggle brain thing through that the devil is bringing things through that but the Christian that then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is 100 years old and see how Sarah that is 19 years old bear and Abraham said unto God oh that Ishmael might live before the he still got a little bit I mean you know he he's coming to a place of the new birth but it's right it even at your first walk you have problems but God's gonna keep going though and watch God's not gonna kill you he's not gonna kill Sarah for thinking these different things because he knows the end and God said Sarah hey ever HAP remember what I said come fall hey boy listen what I'm saying talking to you that's what brother Dale does every Sunday hey talking to you God says through brother Dale hey talking to you and God said look Abraham I'm all riding down for you he did he's roping the Bible he wrote it down for him look and God said Sarah your wife hope ain't no Sarah right now Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac Abraham I'm gonna spill it all out for you and I will establish my covenant with him always move the cover now from just this to now brother Louise talks to brother so-and-so and he comes in and he shares the message with him and he shares eternal life with him and now the covenants going to this guy brother now started to church 12 people got a little over a hundred now not here today yeah but there's spiritual multiplication he said hey brother Dale I've called you to do something I've called you to be my spiritual multiplier and I want you to come to Lula and preach to the people and that's where the promise sons and daughters of God are going to come from and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for Ishmael I have heard thee behold I have blessed him hmm like brother Ram says he said God even in permissive will God bless you but he's got to work back to his perfect will because watch what he said look as for Ishmael I've heard thee I've heard these people that are foolish virgins I don't forget them and I'm not gonna forget them they're gonna be wild child they're not gonna go through what you're going through they're gonna have a lot of tribulation they're gonna have a lot of problems so Ishmael to me would type the people that get eternal life are the foolish virgin because he's not gonna forget him watch and I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 12 Prince's shall he beget and I will make him a great nation but I didn't make a covenant with him but my covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him because what God had to go get in some flesh he was talking to him in spirit forming the theophany of he's he left him he left off talking with him and God went up from Abraham now we see all these what happens here what's happened what's this and I'm gonna tell you this and let you make your own assumption look at verse 24 we up 20 let's read 23 and Abraham took Ishmael his son and all that were born in this house now this is the natural type because this will had to be he told him here plain his household and all that were bought with his money every male among men of Abraham's house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame I now these were not children these were men and Abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin now not to be so graphic but it's a real good type if all of you were circumcised right now tomorrow you'd walk different you'd have to heal but you'd walk different and that's what happens when you get born again you've walked different because God has given you something he's given you and put you in that covenant of promise when you receive the new birth sure you should have started in sanctification walking different but now that you come to the new birth there is no doubt that you gonna walk different if you circumcised yourself at ninety years old he circumcised itself Abraham did remember right there when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin and his son was 13 when he was circumcised they all walk different you get born again you gonna walk different right and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him they all walk different from that day forward and I think you know what let's just stop right there that's long I'd love to get to where but we'll stop right there it'll give me something else to preach later on but that's the new birth let's read now some of the quotes I'd like to get on to wear because remember you got to meet Melchizedek just like now remember he met Melchizedek and justification but remember you didn't see any of meat and milk hesitating sanctification right but here we come to the end of the journey not the end of his journey but we come to the part where we look go to Ezekiel 36 right where it says new birth Genesis 17 Ezekiel 36 that's what you need where you need to be right there God appears again and he's becoming intimate now we'll talk about that maybe next Sunday or whenever we come back where I will take you from among the heathen and gather you're a ball country now this is what we read to a little while ago but we're gonna go further with it because remember we're into the new birth now then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness from your idols will I cleanse thee a new heart also will I give you in a new spirit now we're talking about that remember that new spirit is not the holy spirit well I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit my spirit now that's Almighty God not a third person of a Trinity that's Almighty God Himself that I will put my spirit in the form of the holy spirit which we know it he's intro unity he is a Father Son and Holy Ghost but he's gonna put that spirit but the same person and cause you see to walk you gonna walk a little gingerly at first you gonna walk a little different that's why he made when he changed jacob's name to Israel he wrestled with God God smacked him on the inside of his thigh and he walked different he became a limping Prince you know whatever where he went I like what brother and he said everywhere he went he's asked what's wrong said well I met Dunn and I walked different after I met God I walked different in same way with you and I we walk different and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them you didn't do that up here you did it right here when my spirit went within you they eternal life the new birth right now if you Baptists or whatever one if you want to go to that part where you walk different and you don't do the things you used to do I'll go with you but not if you continue to do the things you've been doing what do you get saved from it's what I told that guy he's drinking a beer and cussing like a sailor and he said all I got saved not too long ago I said what'd you get saved from what did you get saved from to me if we were in a boat fishing and he was a bank president I ain't care didn't Bank it his bank but but I said look John if I'd knocked you out of the boat I said and you drowning I said I'm gonna save you by taking you from one position and putting you in the boat I said what you're telling me is is that God pulled you out of the water and you drove right back in yeah and every time you drown him huh no no our promise is it will walk different amen I'll put my spirit within you look at Brit number five will read these quotes and then we'll be done we'll really get into the new birthday and we can use the whole section next time hidden life with Christ 1956 now the Bible fitter he would give us a new heart and he would give us a new spirit and many people even Pentecostal people and full gospel people has been deceived in that boy can you imagine how many of them went under the bench but the Baptist is going hot no he's talking to everybody you've been deceived by many times God said I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't his spirit that's your spirit then I will put my spirit in you I'll give you a new spirit then I'll put my spirit in you and many times you get the new spirit and think you've got the Holy Spirit and trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life does it wake up my game well you gotta go okay when your life doesn't PV up to that look that word up with you now that's just a little raw but remember that's the truth many people that spirit I'm warning you the same way don't let that new spirit make you think it's the Holy Spirit God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his spirit well some people so mean they can't even get along with ourselves let alone with God if he'd come in that's right so doubtful and up and down God has to give you a new spirit give you a new nature so you can get along with his spirit when it comes in I man I hope you see that God gives you a new spirit for yourself then he puts his Holy Spirit in there to dwell with you and abide with you alright let's go to number six number six the impersonation of Christianity what a good name for a title now watch the Bible says I'll give you take the old stony heart and give you a heart of flesh tender-hearted then I'll give you a new spirit and then I'll put my spirit in you now watch his spirit was different from your new spirit and many people gets the new spirit and think they get the holy spirit they get feeling happy jump around maybe do a few things religiously and they think that they got the Holy Spirit oh no the Holy Spirit makes you act different like I said about circumcision it makes you walk different the Holy Spirit makes you think different the Holy Spirit is put right in the middle of your new spirit and your new spirit was put right in the middle of your new heart new heart new spirit Holy Spirit three men just like brother man told us we have the three men to the outside five senses middle five and one in the middle so he's putting it right there together the new heart the new spirit in the middle of the new heart and says God said I'll put my spirit in you now then God's Spirit sets right in the middle of your spirit your new spirit and then you don't have to go out a night like Miss Jones does I hope there's not somebody like that in here and like mr. Joe there's just something in you you just got the love of God so down in you to you just live it it isn't you it's something in you alright number seven this is last one and we'll then we'll stop right here number seven we get the right one why some people can't keep the victory now many times we try to make things just say well as soon as you get the new spirit you quit your stealing you quit your line things like that you say Oh hallelujah I got it you find out the first time anyone crosses your path a little bit old mercy what a difference sure you blow up like a frog eating buckshot but let me tell you brother that's the reason you never got God's Spirit that's true oh you say he stepped on my toes I'll just not put up with that alright what shows what you got in that shows what you got in you that's true I'll put a new spirit in you and then I'll put my spirit in you now the heart is the center of the emotions of the human being now not the thumping heart he's talking about the inner just like the core your heart is the middle of you that's exactly right so God puts a new heart in the middle of the old man all right there buddy got that that's the one he gets a new heart the pliable one then he puts a new spirit in the middle of the new spirit or heart and puts his spirit in the middle of the new spirit that explains that your memories and conscience are your see taste feel smell in here memories and consulate effects an imagination the spirit of man and the inside man is either full of the Holy Ghost are full of the devil you can't say it this there's no half there's no medium there's no I think I do I'll promise you one thing brothers and sisters the next day Abraham knew he'd been circumcised he knew it he was reminded of it every day hey man so that's the same thing about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost reminds you every day hey you're mine you're mine you don't walk like that and you're sure we're gonna get slapped on our hands we're gonna get all these there things that we made lean over to one side but you just that that desire of not doing it anymore is gone a man and then he takes that desire of that's why people heavenly days yeah musicians come I hope I don't say this wrong but there was a person in our in our post office and she was showing me the things that they had bought to put up to eat what was their wine beer and liquor I said y'all going on a liquid diet but that was what was important because see that fueled what they they thought they would need that to get through this they need they needed a spirit all right Kelly I hope you're not watching in but they needed the Holy Spirit because what that same desire that you human beings have that when we have fear and all these things that we have that same desire in the world outside is quenched with beer and alcohol or a beer and wine and liquor and they think that's going to take care of it but if they'll get the baptism of the holy spirit the real spirit let's stand our feet that spirit well what lasts for an eternity not for just what one night because look circumcision didn't last for just one day it was for the whole even we'll get into this next week because even when Abraham was changed back to a young man it went in Reverse process he was circumcised when he came back to young because listen if you don't get circumcised the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're not gonna get a new body a man because of the circumcision that you have had now in the flesh not the flesh but in what the baptism of the Holy Ghost then that's going to carry you to your body change and there you gonna be circumcised by the heart not by the other way but Abraham as he walked from then til the day he died he knew he had come to a place that he had made a decision and he had changed and that's what you and I got to come to see that God has changed us he's changing me the song says from glory to glory he's changing me amen we're heading toward the body changed folks and we'll but if you don't have if you're not circumcised you're not gonna have a body change that circumcision meant a lot back then spiritually it means a lot now because it means your eternal destination it meant Abraham's destination of where he was going and it means your eternal destination right now let's sing a song that's worship God for just a little while born again page 492 page 492 born again there's really been a change in me born again just like Jesus's amen Oh born-again it all because of Calvary they manually that again man there's really baby it's your picture they broke Jimmy changing me name on him and gave him a never walk just like Jesus Oh born-again and all because of Calvary oh I'm so glad [Music] let's sing that for 89 there brother Luis right across to top Jesus be the lord of all not okay we test Kiev F if you need worship and maybe when you're there in your in your home Lord we pray if there's anybody that has a fear of this thing is coming on we pray that you would settle their fear Lord and change it into face that we're realized Lord that you've changed this line and that we love you for that Lord Jesus I surrender Jesus eyes [Music] you know we were in the service a long time ago it may have been Louisiana camp and the brother was singing that song and he said you know he says as a police officer he said this that's not surrender I know brother Dale can't lift this left shoulder but but look if you come up and the cop tells you to surrender and you're doing this right here you're gonna have an extra hole because they don't know what's behind here you have not surrender at all but if you got both that's why they tell you both hands up both hands out why because you've surrendered so let's sing it one more time and let's really surrender Jesus I surrender all hiding nothing we're hiding nothing Jesus sir oh Jesus you know the Bible says when that God had to leave Abraham they didn't leave him he's not gonna leave you to birth but you know what he had to do he had to go getting some human flesh and what happened it's a new birth you know one thing's for sure I know I got to get what I need from a man in human flesh standing right here talking outside down to Sunday School class so God just moves over and gets into human flesh and then we'll talk about that later then he meets Abraham in human flesh hey man so god bless you love you with the love of the Lord thank you all for coming and we'll do this like Sid Wednesday night same format same people nobody extra because we're doing it just like the way the government wants us to do at the moment and we will have brother Bob will be with us and like say well we'll have the same will do the same format will start at 7:00 we'll play the tape till 7:00 o'clock start at 7:00 7:15 brother Bob will be out in the pulpit and just pray if you don't feel good please don't come okay because listen sickness can get on this thing right here we're not immune from it but we pray we pray that God will keep that dome over us that protection like the land of goshen and like he did with the children of israel that when the plagues fell they were sitting in in total light and the whole world was in total darkness same God same God and he was just with the people then he's in us he was just with them now he's in us so we carry that light with us that like the Goshen so if all mine's clear let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for the state that you give us we think for the time that's allotted that we've come here Lord to serve you father in spirit and truth and we pray Lord that you would bind us closer together Lord let us look to you the author and finisher of our faith we know the world is trying their best to do what they can and we're going to let them do that they only know of physical drugs and physical things they can do but Lord we know that you work in a totally spiritual realm we know that you can go now to these different countries and as we we pray every day Lord you know that that we we pray the Lord that you'll that the sensor will run through this United States of America in the different countries and that you'll stay this plague Lord that the death toll will go down Lord here at once you get people tested huh I know the different media outlets don't want you to know people to know that you know 90% of the people are not affected and they're just you know hanging on the other things but Lord we pray that we we don't we've already read yesterday's news I mean we've already read tomorrow's news we've already read the news for the next whatever time till the till the end time comes Lord because you gave us a prophet and you gave us the word you gave a spiritual insight so that we can see and understand what's going on Lord so I pray that we not fear that's what's gripping this world Lord that will not fear because we know what's coming next because you told us Lord and we've got that now we've got that spiritual rudder on the back of our boat and we know that Lord when you turn it in one direction that's the way that boats got to go so I pray Lord that you would truly be the Lord of all of our hearts and that you'll put your spirit if somebody today is not born again that you'll take your spirit and put it in their spirit and make them Lord an eternal creature with you probably give us this day our daily bread forgive us of our sins be with us on the way home be with us in our jobs that you'll keep us Lord that that will have good good jobs Lord as we continue through this Lord you've always done it you've always took care of your own father so I pray that you'd do that but I truly do pray that you'll extend that grace to the world and that you'll help them Lord we know they not all gonna be saved but Lord we pray that you would stay this plague that you would help them Lord as they're in pain and agony and all the all the whole world is groaning the Bible says Romans the whole world now truly is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God father give us Lord truth I believe you have I believe you'll keep us Lord till we come back wings tonight with our brother Bob and you'll give him the words of eternal life father keep our pastor safe keep him healthy Lord keep all this away from any of us all the older ones in the in the church Lord brother dick and all the different ones we pray Lord that you'd give them life and if you'll help them Lord in this time of trouble Lord we pray that you'd be with us now in Jesus name Amen [Music]
