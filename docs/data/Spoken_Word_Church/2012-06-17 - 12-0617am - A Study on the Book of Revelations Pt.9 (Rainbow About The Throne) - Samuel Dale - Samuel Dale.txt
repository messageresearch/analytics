on the bank trying to get the fish in and we was had had a real good time a lot of fun you know a lot of good eats everything it was wonderful thank everybody for what you done the cooking and the the fixing and the doings and we had just a just a great time amen amen we do that remember this morning brother Donnie Mo that goes to Brother Richard Wilson you remember he had open heart surgery the other day and he's now running a little temperature so that's not a good thing you know in that class but just remembering that everything will be all right and we got a note now back this was on the 14th when we received the note that sister uh Janice green brother per Green's wife was having a lot of trouble with nose bleeding but there wasn't anything updated today on it that was the 12th I think no 15th got 15th I think all right but just remember her and pray that the Lord would take care of everything all right let's pray together Lord Jesus we love you we thank you for everything thank you for your Gra Grace and your understanding thank you for you and we just pray now that you would come Among Us and Lord not be an onlooker to what we're doing and trying to sa but to be the preeminent one in each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us Lord from all unrighteousness just bless us now as we read your word and we talk about you and you come Among Us and speak to our hearts have your way remember these that are sick Lord remember Sister Green our Lord the request for her we pray that you would just reach down and touch and deliver from that nose bleeding condition let everything be all right we love you and be with brother Donnie Moore Lord take away that temperature CU it's not a good thing in that situation but we pray that you would just bless and guide each one have your way now in Jesus name amen amen Revelations 1 1 through3 that we've been reading as always on this part and just trying to speak about the Book of Revelations and to see you know that we can uh gain a little better understanding and hope that the Lord has blessed you with it I've enjoyed it anyway Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which most must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he s blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated The Lord At His blessing for the reading of the word remember the time is at hand the time to understand the time to understand is here with us and we thank the Lord for that and you know believe that this is the hour that God has given unto us to where we can can read the word and you know see it but not to just see it as we we have been seeing it remember our whole thought is based upon one thing that we were told to stay away from The Book of Revelations because we couldn't understand it but see the devil didn't want us to read it to find out who we are because it shows who we are and where we're at and what's going on and and everything but it took a prophet to come right so then thank God that the prophet came brought the message broke the symbols and spoke to us on these things now we can see ourselves amen and and then seeing ourselves then we can uh you know uh be able to rejoice in the reading of the word and like I've said to you many times to me then the Book of Revelation is really the bride's book amen because it Springs it personally here Peter could say I have a more sure word of Prophecy because he had the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he had been up on the mountain and he had a more sure word by the new birth well see we can say that we have a more sure word amen uh of Prophecy because uh you know prophecy is sitting in order of scriptures so we have a wonderful opportunity to be able to rejoice in the word and see who we are and brother BR said when the bride realizes who she is she be gone amen that's right you be gone that's just what we need to do realize who we are amen and sit back and relax and have a good time and doing it you know and see our day because remember he said arm and devil is not written in the Bible but said what's going on in the day that arm and Nevil is upon the Earth and said that put his name right in the word well all right see then you know we we we rejoice in seeing the word unfold unto us amen all right now we've covered up to and we're over now to uh starting in Revelations 4 and you know we went through the the revelations one by Pastor Church ages because they are self-explanatory uh basically and then getting over into uh the Rapture taking place in Revelations 4:1 the you know John went up as a type and and then from Revelations uh 41 or 4 there to 19 uh the bride is not seen see because she's up in heaven right then you I said and I've covered it and a review it a lot so you say then well what about Revelation 10:7 well what about it right you better leave it where it's at CU if you don't leave it where it's at you won't have anything to go to Israel right amen you know because from 4 to 19 brother around and said is to Israel so they get this message amen that's right they get this message a wonderful thing see but John says but in the days so he looks back and he sees that hey there's an opportunity for me to take this back to the seven to the church ages cuz he were told to write it to the ages he was told to write it to the book to Roman you know I mean to Rome he was told to write it to the church ages amen you know and then when he did then he says there's a prophet that can be brought so it doesn't move anything it's you don't have to change anything in the word it's perfect amen we just believe it and see it Y and just because we know what's going on doesn't mean that we're there that's the wonderful part of it we can stand here yes in a time element things and see things that'll be on P when we will actually even go into a Rapture and leave out of here and and and all and and see the things of what's happening on Earth because God is Not withholding anything from his bride that's right amen he's allowing her to see the word of God or understand the word of God that's right all right but then we got down to this last uh Wednesday speaking on uh there in Revelations 41 and 2 or 4 1 2 that it was speaking of the throne in heaven but we saw that that Throne had to start on Earth in Jesus Christ right all right then he he could go up into heaven another dimension or whatever you want to call it and and remain there sitting on the throne and it was his father's Throne because he said if you overcome you'll sit with me in my Throne as I've overcome to sit my father in his throne see that was not the Throne of Jesus Christ that'll be in the millennial Reign when it comes down to the throne of Jesus Christ you know the promise of the son of man and the son of David finishing and see then it winds up that the one sitting on the throne is the very Eternal almighty God Amen so we believe in one true and living God not uh well this this is one person and that's another person this no no no it's just one sitting on the thr right but the throne represented the you know the point of where that Jesus Christ was on the earth that was the Throne of God was in the Heart of Jesus Christ yes amen all right then he went up on and you know know ascended and sent the Holy Ghost back on the day of Pentecost setting up the Throne of God in the heart of man amen by the new birth all right now when this matches here then what is dire that's right then we're going to have to go there right I mean it's it's not a a horrible point or a thought or something that can't be comprehended when we match he what God sees we're going die that's where else can you go right you know so then the throne represented the in the heart of mankind but there was one sitting on the throne all right and I kept trying to emphasize to us that we say oh but brother Dale uh you know when I got the new birth I understood and I I just saw one God no no you don't do it exactly that way right you see one God when the prophet brought the word to us right amen you know and then we understand it because he brought it right uh sure I was back there in the Baptist believing in one God and would argue you to death but I only knew how to explain it as God in three persons see because that was what we thought the the the truth was all right but we know that's not true person's personality personality is an individual Etc so then we were trinitarian just like everybody else all right but then when we saw the truth then God is brought to the throne of your heart by Revelation or statue of a perfect man whatever you want to call it uh the basis by Revelation he comes to our Throne we had him dethroned down Through the Ages that's right all right he was off the Throne of of man not that he didn't save people not that he wasn't living in their heart that's but he wasn't in their Revelation cuz they were trinitarians all right but see now we see that he can be restored to the throne amen so we don't see but if we see that there's more than one sitting on the throne we still don't have the Revelation right all right and if we get into all of these uh you know he wouldn't go the River Jordan or two Lords or whatever these things are then you got too many gods sitting on the throne that's right so then you know we need to work on that and uh it's kind of like a man told me at work one day he said you know said well uh I thought you believed in three Gods but I see now you don't said you really believe in two and I said well at least we got rid of one of them so let's keep on going you know but you know but see it's a revelation is what we're looking at amen but if it don't start in our hearts on Earth in the New Birth then there is no heaven for us to go to that's right amen all right see but it starts there and then it be builds here exactly the same scene if you want to call it the same picture uh whatever you want to call it uh that's in heaven will be here on Earth all right but brother R said it's got to be the same Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ that's right all right see then you say well I just don't see that will open your eyes that's you're looking for something that will never happen you're looking for uh somebody to be able to do what brother R done that was in one man but now I believe that in the bride of Christ around the world is the ministry and manifestation of God that was in brother of RAM and in the Lord Jesus Christ because it was the same Ministry but it's got to be around the world so we only have our part that's right amen it can't be in the fullness in one person anymore right and that's why I don't look for another Prophet to come see to to try to bring it is because it's already been brought by the prophet amen that's right we need the Holy Ghost to reveal it to us all right now are you you following what I'm talking about then yes see then Jesus Christ when he came he paid the price he ascended and he went to the Father Strong right all right now you know we get into all of that of saying he went up there and the Holy Ghost come back we'll read that in a second you know well that's wonderful that's what happened right but don't get it in your mind that there's a dead body laying on the throne right waiting on something to happen that's right I thought he was building us a future home you know that's what I thought I mean oh yeah but see we we we try to limit to our comprehension that's right Revelation has nothing to do with comp comprehension that's right that may sound odd but it doesn't you don't comprehend a revelation Revelation comes and that is the comprehension itself you don't work it up or think it up or plan it up or study it up or whatever it is you do all of that to get a foundation where God can speak to you but if he don't speak it's still this intellect right and it letter Paul said it letter kill it all right but see what we got that far into to looking at the throne in heaven and the one sitting on the throne all right now then we tied it back so I want you to watch this in a little while when we get down to the the rainbow and and and I mean not the rainbow that'll becep the uh uh beginning and the ending and all like that and watch it all TI together as to one thing and some surprises that brother Brandon will actually make make statements that sounds like that are if you try to do it naturally you'll never figure it out but if we take the spiritual application we can see right amen all right that's right so remember this as we're going in cuz this is the hell that Throne is now in the heart of man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that does not do away with the throne in heaven that's right right that's right all right the Corporal body is not here right amen all right so somewhere the Corporal body the glorified body we read the minute is waiting for something here to happen to be able to come and he still doesn't set foot on Earth no even though we beat him in the a he don't set on foot on Earth until the millennial rain with the bride that's right amen but see that's what we try to get it all figured out you can't do it that's right can't you study you pray and you ask God to reveal that's right that's right and that's why i' run around him and say I wouldn't preach on hell until it's revealed y i study things for 20 years 30 years would not preach on it why cuz I couldn't see it right I could give you ever quote I could give you every scripture I could have made an intellectual speech I could give you my opinion yeah but what good is in opinion that's right I'd rather have a man with Revelation in all opinions in the world right what is to say in the shortest pencil is better than the longest memory that's right cuz you can write down things and keep it all right but now let's think about it a throne sitting in heaven and I want to just make this clear as we go into it we go ahead brother Anderson then and by the way Brother Anderson got back we didn't feed him to the virus no we didn't even see any of this we didn't see one this time we didn't have any trouble whatsoever that's right and he made it back had a good time seeing some of these that that go out and you know in new and all and and some come and be with us that hadn't before that's really great brother Joe Solace has got the record on the fish but it's the smallest one but he's got the record I said well can you cook them no but you greas a fan with it okay look what the prophet has s a message called Faith 1956 427 uh paragraph or e47 Christ died he become a man see he's backward in his statement but he's talking he become a man all right he took our sins upon himself and went there and was nailed to the cross and his soul was rent from him and cast into hell and God raised him up on the third day for our justification and sent the Holy Ghost back to us and the glorified body of his son sitting on his throne in heaven watch what a type it is there amen a glorified body sitting on the throne so you got to deal with that body y right it's got to be somewhere there's got to be a heaven and that's my emphasis cuz I've heard he preach you know that that people of the message that become so spiritual until they just do away with everything we are the Throne of God there is no throne in heaven where did he get that from he didn't get out of the Bible didn't get out of prophet man he must have got it out of Walmart as you're walking around but listen Church there's a heaven to go to amen amen hallu but what we found the key was we may go up there but one day Heaven's going to leave there and come down here all right that's right going to be a wonderful day in it all right but look what he says now the glorified body of his son is sitting on his throne MH what a wonderful position sitting on the throne all right now listen if it's true that the glorified body is sitting on the throne then why would we want to comprehend PR gods or anything you know when not try to comprehend the the truth to understand the truth right right well when we get up part of Heaven is it going to be a you know a son and a father not Holy Ghost and you know or is it going to be Jesus amen what's it going to be amen well your Oneness that's all right I can at least preach from Genesis to Revelation about it right and I can see him in many forms reveal himself but you'll never get a Oneness to bring the life form of God on Earth to the bright we'll find out ask them no Jesus was the life form of God to a Oneness no sir the bride is the life form of God on the earth me she's the final voice to the final age all right but it's Christ in her right because that's how the throne comes forth that's how we become the Throne of I I got myself cannot be the Throne of God see it takes all the bride of Christ around the world to match that that he's sitting there right I can only speak of it John listen John only typed the Rapture right why did he type it because nobody else didn't go the Rapture didn't come right there is that sensible right amen so he was at top of it he he went over but he come back all right see I just got my part and my part is speaking of what's on the throne but you got to have your part am amen then we got to have it all together right so keep that in mind look at the next one this is the message called discernment Discerning of the body of the Lord 19 58818 812 excuse me U page 19 ready the great light the P of fire is the same one today the holy spirit of God the body of Jesus Christ sits at the right hand of God on his throne in heaven but his spirit is here on Earth completing and finishing his work remember brother Brown said Jesus Jesus did not complete his work when he was here on Earth he said he left something for us to do amen right right something for us to do all right now and that same spirit that Liv in the body of Jesus Christ Was the Same Spirit that was in that angel that come to Sodom and gor because there's only one God do you believe that the same one that followed the children of Israel the same God right many forms many ways of appearing amen but the same God they only time look at the next we'll try to get these three readings out then we'll go Jehovah Gyra part 1 62705 paragraph 166 and God was showing there to Abraham that through his seed that God himself would become flesh and then have to be separated at Calvary I wonder about showing this to there and Abraham typing it all of that was back there where do we get this afternoon of the 24 Elders huh Christ being God on Earth he was separated God tore him apart Royal Seed of Abraham and took the life out of him and raised up the body up to sit on his throne in heaven and sent back the spirit of him upon the church that the church has to have the same same Spirit was in Christ to make it come together making Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's what I love confirm confirmation of the Covenant God confirming the Covenant God separating turning the life from Christ his son taking the spirit out of him as he cut these animals in two standing between the animals you remember what happened to Abraham right you know that he went to sleep he saw the thing he saw hell he saw what he saw the light he saw all the things all right see then if there's only one sitting on the throne why do we want to think of comprehensions of anything of understanding of of some form of trinitarianism or any kind of isms right when we've got the truth about it get over in the church age book and I I had it the other day and I didn't read it where brother around said that how many's on the throne he said one on the throne amen it can't be anything else right but now remember then I'm be asking you a question then we'll get off and going the throne that Jesus Christ went to was the Throne of the father right amen yep right that's Father Strong we gave you them the other night all right now where's the father now if Jesus and the father is not the same God right well brother de you just don't understand the son's up there and the father came back down here well according to my Bible Jesus said you might he said I and my father will come back we'll take up our boat in you amen so where's the father at as the Prophet asked the question of if all power in Heaven and Earth Jesus said after his resurrection given on me he said then if you got another God said he's powerless that was simple statement was it but a gospel truth amen so if you got any form in your mind or thinking of these other doctrines that are floating around then I would consider the truth of trying to find the one true and living God Amen in the correct way and and try to get that one on the throne because what are we going to to match right right you remember matching pieces 10 years ago something like that series on it matching pieces if we don't match if we're not matching here what's there we're not going there amen but when we match what's there we have to go there that's right Martin Luther reach what God saw that he would reach there was nowhere else for him to go right sure he hung around a little while and preached on just on the just you live by faith but he to leave right why because God was through with him but he ain't going to be through with us right he's going to be here in Us in his fullness Amen to take us there when it's a matching so where's the father that's what I was trying to illustrate a moment ago see then the throne was made possible into our hearts right so it's Christ in you the hope of glory living in your heart that's right by the new birth amen and that matches what's in heaven that's right cuz it's just one sitting up there amen and that's Jesus Christ right that's right see now you got your One True Living God in the correct order you're not just talking about Jesus the body anybody knows that can read the the body of Jesus Christ was a creation right amen which mean it wasn't Eternal right that's where it had to be made Eternal in the resurrection but now we have an eternal body laying on the throne M now if the blood of bulls and goats people could be healed what about an eternal sacrifice glorified sacrifice oh I love them Parts amen all right now let's go over and and read a little bit in Revelations 4 now take up our thought and continue on so we've been down through verse one and covering that and then in verse two he said and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one set on the throne okay we we've covered that coming down and now watch and he that set was to look upon now he is a a personal pronoun right so there has to be someone sitting there right and he that was to he that set was to look upon it doesn't say he's jaspering sard in stone right it's not stoned it's symbolics right right John looks and sees the throne he sees the one sitting on the throne all right now see and the one sitting on the throne was the one to try to help him just understand you know I'll show you things to come he looks he sees the throne like I told you he sees it in stages he sees the throne he could have stopped wrote the book sent it down to the church then continued it and said hey there's one on the throne cuz it was unfolding to John all right keep it unfolding as you're looking now when he looks the one on the throne is the Lord Jesus Christ himself but he's to look upon right he he's he's that's that's the symbolic he's to look upon what as what now as a Jasper's artist huh now on your computers if you start trying to run it in I give you a little help some of you if you're running in don't run in sard sardin sard let me pronounce it the way I read it sometime don't read sardin Stone don't do that in running brother R he always called it Sardis if you run into the Sardine you're only going to get the quote comes in the scripture he doesn't use it that way he he's just more or less breaking the word down that's just a hecky but look a throne was set in heaven and one set on a throne now how does this person the he remember once and he how does this person look now John is going to see a symbolics he knows who it is but he's going to see a symbolics or a symbol so he's to look upon now forgive me for trying to explain something when maybe sometimes it shouldn't need to be or just go and forget it but I I I always like to help everybody if I can amen don't I like to be hit myself and he's to look upon he's described as now watch from where he came I let that float a little bit the symbolics is describing from where he came you know the reason that Abraham is called a Hebrew well it's not a tribe it's not a f it was a word that meant one from the other side of the river so the man sees Abraham coming walking across the river he said hey Abraham you're a Hebrew and was no words back there of Hebrew and stuff like that Jews and that didn't come on until over in Second Kings even the word Jew right but then what so amazing to me is the Bible said I brought your father Abraham from the other side of the flood he did come from over on the other side the Big River didn't he but that's what it means Hebrew means one from the other side where you come from you come from the other side over to here that means you're a Hebrew the man didn't say Abraham a Hebrew he said Abraham you come from the other side of the river right when they wrote it down they wrote Abraham Hebrew see because that was a word interpreted from the other side all right so that's what it's saying here it's telling you of Jasper and sardin stone that's where this man come from MH that would be his origin or beginning amen so now what did John see see if you tried to draw how could you draw that out what you just draw out a stone you no no you know John understood so who is Jasper and who's the sardine stone and you'll see where he come from isn't that the first son of Jacob and the last son of Jacob MH yep all right we'll get to that this evening with the 24 bring it up into that way but think about it where this man come from this man came that he seeing and he looks at him and he says there's man he said let me describe you that he's a Jasper and a sarden stone y showing that he was what was in Jacob the promise coming down right are you listening yes all right get these little things in your mind just that's why to me it's so wonderful we just read Jasper well I know what that is that's that's Ruben and benjam well we're glad we got that straight no that's where this man came from and I don't care how horrible you think about Reuben wouldn't Ruben the one that slept his um father's concubine amen wouldn't Ruben and them the one that are Ruben that tried then later to make amends I guess and tried to save Joseph you know yeah and they wound up selling him instead of killing him right you know all the things all right but get the point this man this one sitting on the throne is to look upon a description of him all right now A description of him so we're going to approach it just a little different than he generally would so let's just go ahead with number four brother because I want you to get this point with it but remember now we'll get through the rainbow round about the throne in a minute so we're going to talk about Alpha and Omega cuz that's what Jasper and sardine was the beginning and the ending of Jacob's children all right we'll get back to that in a minute the Lord will them try it together but I want you to see this because when once we start reading in a minute now listen you're going to hear Brother brandom relating to the rainbow and relating to the a to the Z then you're going to hear him relating to the rainbow and you're going to hear him relating to the church y right see we just want to come up and get up on a throne sit down and it ain't too good of a place in short take a big old throne for all of the Bride down through all the ages to sit on that's right see didn't all we want in the rainbow all right but this means all the way around right well you're going to see something this evening from it and when you see those 24 Elders they're around the throne right that's why the throne in heaven can be seen totally in circumference when we're here on Earth you only see half of a rainbow right that's right you can't see it down through the Earth come back around now if you look up in the sky sometime that means ever seen a rainbow around the sun see you're seeing it round about doing that because it's showing because it's up in heaven but watch now he talking about Alpha and Omega and I know that's back over in Revelation like 18 or whatever it is in now Alpha is the a in the Greek letter Omega is the Z in the Greek letter in other words if it was translated today I Am A to Z watch it now who else is this now he's putting back scriptures with it see watch it I am the first I am the last I am from A to Z right right we'll get down to one in a minute and then get down to what people are doing in the message with it and missing it going to the next one number five this is taken from patas Vision uh 124 evening service 1960 paragraph 143 he hears the trumpets and thing saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last not announcing of the second part party are the third party amen but the only party amen I am both Alpha and Omega see I've heard people say Jesus was Alpha we Omega that's that's you're getting close but remember when you we a lot you get a problem there right right if you've got the alpha in the Omega you're in the correct order right all right but if you just got an alpha and omega you got us two people right so he'd be one we'd be one you got a problem that's right all come on and watch what he says before I show you in he's the only party before I show you anything I want you to know who I am now that's what Jesus wanted them to know so I drop them down the greatest Revelation is revelation of the godhead the deity right the first thing you have to know is the deity of Christ I am Alpha and Omega I am from A to Z there's no more but me like that I was at the beginning watch I'll be at the end I am he that was which is and shall come the almighty think of it that's what the trumpet said amen now in the message there is a Doctrine of the some people that used to preach it pretty heavily I haven't heard it lately but theyd say see there said he's Alpha and he's Omega and he's nothing in between well there a quote we got it but they point was that he was Alpha and Omega and I've heard it so I don't mind standing here saying he said it right here the man years ago said he's Alpha and he's Omega and said said he said nothing in between you see there Luther and Wesley and them didn't have nothing that's what he said that'll be me in glory any want to argue it but I heard the man say it now his emphasis was that Luther and Wesley and them didn't have anything in Pentecost you know J Street and see then he use this quote right here go ahead and pull it up look number six taken from the Masterpiece go to the next one okay the Masterpiece 705 1964 paragraph 172 173 the Alpha and Omega is the same watch you he said I'm alha and Omega he never said anything in between yep that right quot yep uh-huh I am Alpha and Omega the first in the LI yes sir well brother said it do what brother Brown said it did he that's right see if he's Alpha and Omega that's what I saying if he's Alpha and we Omega you got a problem because you got two two people that's right right but if he's Alpha and Omega there is nothing in between that's right there's not another God to be revealed that's right amen there's nothing in between there he's the same yesterday today and forever right Luther Wesley and him had a new birth for their age right well that was the emphasis the brother made that preached here on it mhm I've heard others beside him preach on it their emphasis was trying to make it to somebody didn't house some now if you read that in what brother R was saying you know he never said anything in between that's right cuz there's not another God in between he didn't say there ain't nothing in between he say see the first Ministry now what's he talking about right that's it the first Ministry in the Life Ministry that's right amen that's what he's talking about okay we're right now we know what we're talking about the first Ministry with the Lord Jesus Christ amen put it in the early church yes the alpha y bring it back in the end times through the prophet's Ministry you got the same Ministry Jesus Christ had now down through there they had the ministry of Christ right but not into manifestation through the opening of the word as it is in the Alpha and the Omega so he's right the first Ministry and Life Ministry is a sign the first message and the second life message is a sign I'm I was in Alpha I'm in Omega there'll be a day that won't be called day or night but in the evening time it shall be light see Alpha and Omega it's become the first and the light oh my brethren we come can stay for hours do you understand that he's not saying that there's nothing down between there because you better get some of your drawings correctly if you going to try to draw something cuz according to my understanding reading in Revelation 1113 this son of man that said one like unto the son of man said is standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks now if we're going to interpret words Miss means middle but if you're going to interpret that wrongly you'll put him more in the Dark Ages than he is here which he was as far as giving his life in the church but not in the message wise right no everybody understand amen you say well that's that's we don't understand that that's not vital why is it not vital I just covered about three things that shows you where this very vital to understand right CU if you think that Luther and wesle him didn't have anything where is your foundation to stand on and if you draw out the candlesticks that you're looking at right here in the bottom of the pull pit part and if he's in the midst that means he's in the middle all right now you know what that means if he's Hebrews 13:8 he's the same in every Church amen that's why it means missed he's in ever Church a that's right right that's correct now see that way then we can come out with understanding to where we can see that the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same amen get the next one then we'll go to our point the Philadelphian Church age 1210 1960 paragraph 135 he said I'm Alpha and Omega in other words I'll be Supreme in the first M watch I'll be Supreme in the last wonderful right his ministry with d his ministry of here wonderful as long as you don't do away what's in the middle the same Gospel Power that raised up here on the one hand at the East has Shone over and now in the other hand at the West Alpha and Omega I am I I am a and I am Z he's all of it right amen so then that brings Christ into correct understanding right and it restores him to the throne of your Revelation brings him back to the position of seeing it as your Revelation all right now we drop to where we want take the point and that's what I hope that'll help you to see because in our Revelation that we we were just reading he said I am the what what to look upon verse three and he that was set was to look upon he that set was to look upon like Jasper and sarden right amen right yep first son of Jacob last son of Jacob mhm now Joseph is in there right next to the last one and Joseph is more of a perfect type of Christ right right he was more of the Covenant type right he received a coat of many colors from his father that's right the showing that he was a covenant one but see he came from that right Jesus Christ came through all all of those prophets we watch it now we'll get back this even and pick this up more all those prophets was Christ am and brother Brown ties together he said even them Patriarchs as bad as you want to read they done it you can't get much worse than Abraham lying and giving his wife away a couple of times or whatever and then Isaac coming along beating his daddy and doing the same thing right you can't put it on any kind of lineage like that you're putting it on the spiritual lineage that was in representation to come down through those Joseph was not Jesus Christ he was only used as a type of Christ he was given the coat of many colors he was raised up and done but he had a flaw remember right he told his daddy he said them Egyptians don't like sheep birders and when you get down there I said you tell them your a h her yeah you know cattle yeah let them think you're cattle hder one they would have been able to hurt a blatant of the sheep coming over the hills but you know but listen Jasper and sarden stone right amen go ahead and pull up number eight brother remember the point now this is where the one on the throne is coming from the Covenant the promise right and there he was standing there what and he was to look upon as Jasper and Sardis Stone what was Jasper was Ruben Stone what was arst Benjamin the Reuben was the Jasper right artist was the Benjamin the first in the last he was to look upon as the first in the last and a rainbow around his head somebody read that next part now that's not mentioned the word revelation 4 right it's not mentioned in Revelations 4 about the seven golden Candlestick what is your Prophet doing no on they showing how to all ties together right listen church if you see one one little flicker of understanding of Jesus Christ and really believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever you have the capability of understanding all the whole the whole pillar fire if you just got a little flicker CU if you can see a little flicker you can see the whole thing right and brother random is not in Revelation 4 right Candlestick is not in Revelation 4 but he's reading it just like he said Revelations 4 y he's reading he's putting a rainbow in the church read it with me see was Ruben Stone Jasper was s stone Benjamin first and the life he would look upon as a first in the life and a rainbow that's in the scripture there first we read around his head over the sil and golden Candlestick so you know what I give you another key Revelations 5 coming up key number 92 okay evidently somebody else is on that Throne y no you just spent time telling us NE but one there I agree with you let's see if you agree with me if the bride sitting on that Throne is any difference in him and her remember we become the Throne of God down here to be able to go there so who's going to be sitting on the throne you see him you see her if you see her you see him thank you Jesus watch that as we go along reading some of the quotes and a rainbow a rainbow a covenant that God had made through Abraham he back in the Old Testament through Isaac through Christ through the Church by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the robe of the seven colors that was upon Joseph that was Upon Jesus is upon the church today to protect right right now watch you keep TI these together look at the next one this is from Lord show us the father and it suffice us 53 3 907 a e52 then I happened to think he was out I forgot what I was looking this morning what he was doing he was out um by himself some hunting and he saw the rainbow you know in the uh you remember the squirrel and the chip and and all I think was in that part he saw the rainbow then I happen to think again that when John on the aisle of patmas turned around and seen this seen J Jesus sitting there to look on as a rainbow is Sardis and jasper stone which was a Ruben and Benjamin the first and the he which is and which is shall come Roo and offspring of David the morning star and over him was a rainbow with the seven golden candlesticks meaning that he had a covenant for the seven Life Church ages now where did the lamb come from to take the book from the throne that's right really brother R is technically because it says it's behind the throne that's just the way I'm saying he walks around takes the book from the hand one sitting on the throne climbs up and sits down that's a revelation right he said it becomes the one on the throne the church you think think that I'm what I'm doing and that's exactly what I'm doing I'm on the godhead I've been on the godhead for 40 something years right amen all of my preaching is on the godhead whether it's marriage and divorce serpent seed um things that are to be uh matching pieces I'm preaching on the godhead but I'm trying my best if you and I to see the godhead correctly right and when we see it correctly we're going to see who we are brother R said quot he is not complete without you yes Lord the bride quote is part of the mystery amen and must be revealed that's right that's what I'm trying to do amen show you where we're at and what we're doing okay look to next one number 10 next ations 54-20 paragraph 10 excuse me 835 oh great Jehovah God who looks down from the heaven the God gave us this rain and gave us this rainbow sign I said I can't see another rainbow sign in I can see EXC I can see another rainbow sign in Revelation 2 but it's really Revelation 4 all right because what he said where Jesus sitting to look upon like Jasper and sarden stone Ruben and Benjamin the first and the last with a rainbow crossing the seven Church ages the Colors oh the same yesterday today and forever alpha and omega beginning and the ending he that was and which is and shall come the root and offspring of David the Morning Star sitting behind me seven colors God's covenant with the church that he wrote with Jesus Christ his son of a perfect Redemption so you're seeing the Plan of Redemption now remember that for this afternoon we're seeing the Plan of Redemption right as it unfolds right now look at the next one this is the seven Church ages preach in 1954 512 paragraph 110 and he looked Upon Jesus had seven rainbow colors above him he was in this which was God's covenant and he was standing in the midst of seven golden Candlestick it was a look upon his Jasper and sardone Jasper was Reuben and sardone was Benjamin that was the first in the life of the Patriarchs that Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending and the Seven rainbow colors seven Church ages the Covenant with him and the Seven golden candlesticks with the Seven Stars Oh What a Beautiful oh what a picture if we get to it after a while maybe the Lord willing all right and he goes Alpha and Omega who is he what's this revelation of that's right Jesus Christ what and here he's not a prophet AB here he is the almighty God manifested the alpha omega I'm from A to Z I am I'm he that was which is and shall come I am the almighty pretty clear isn't it no change of controversy there Lord which was which is and shall come the almighty y bring him into understanding y now may I go back to my statement I've made every service so in the Book of Revelations you do not see Jesus by himself that's right you him in the B that's right you don't see him by himself right he's always with his bride revealing himself in his bride amen you know my wife always get on to me I just made that way I'm sorry I had to get out of it I'm honest I'd be standing around talking to somebody and I just didn't introduce her to my wife I thought everybody know me you man start to pull the good one last night give you a little wake up thing we went to eat and when we ped up going around the table I ped up sitting with sister Johnny giggy on one side and sister Johnny on the other would have seen this guy over there I laughed I sit there laughing this you could me I told my son started to reach over hey honey I mean the guy you just misunderstood I really thought he was going to come over where at you know and I was going to say sir when he walked said I want you to introduce you to my wife K would you stand up what I was going to do but anyhow I I just me and she'd say you you you don't want them to know who I am I said I want it and I con the phras got in trouble with it I said when you got a thoroughbred horse you don't have to brag on the horse she said now you're calling me a horse so I can't bragging the right way but I went to Jamaica years ago and my wife she knew I couldn't handle it and that was first time brother Harris and I went in 93 so she uh she tagged all my clothes cuz she didn't go with me I don't give a hood if it's brown and green I don't bother me and so she put a tag in you know day one shirt okay day one Pants Day they one TR they W socks hold I come to day one I just didn't give a days mixed up I if I got them mixed up I had a problem but told this lady I saw it and I was

said that tag it's said going home shirt going home pants going home socks well it wasn't long after the end she went with me and I told the same sister that was there I said I don't have no tags in my socks and shirts and the pants you looked at me I should said have brought the tiger if anybody in this message don't know who who my wife is and can't see it there's something wrong anyway but I'm just that away I'm just sorry but I'm trying my best to introduce her to everybody I see you and CU I do believe she's my wife if they can't look around and and see her and me you know cuz it wouldn't matter to me she's this morning fixy tie do this She lays out my clothes and I go I say brown socks course it's funny sometimes we got blue stuff you know all laid out blue and I say brown sockt no blue all right now you're awakeing enough for me to finish this a little bit now listen did we get two with this one yeah okay let's go on to the next one and try to get I think there only a couple more my point of emphasis is one thing remember what I'm trying to say when you come to Revelations 4 right there that there's one sitting on the throne but is the look upon as Jasper and sard of stone be the alpha of the Omega and then we read there I didn't read the scripture but we had it up it's a rainbow roundabout the Drone now that rainbow is a covenant right Noah's day a rainbow was given to show that the world would never be destroyed again with water he was given a rainbow a covenant anytime you want to do it you take a water hose on a sunny day you can make a rainbow you ever done that just take us water hose and just fan it up in the air there's a beautiful rainbow just turn it into the Sun and it's beautiful no I just never have found a gold at the end of it you know we get up there and it goes around maybe we can but listen listen church now now this great subject we had last night which he's referring back the first night before life was the church and the church ages how that we seen Jesus standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick to look upon his Jasper and sarden stone it's it's not shown in there are you listening he's putting together Revelations 1 2 3 4 he's done as I said a minute ago went back in the Old Testament to pick up Abraham and him to see a rainbow a covenant which is Jesus Christ amen and then when you do you see the seven Church ages and see them sitting right there with him that's right yes sir now I'd remember too this for later if that Lamb with seven horns and seven eyes y is the right understanding I know you're going to who's going to take the book that's right we might get into something Revelation 5 right to look on a Jasper s it's on the beginning end and Ruben Benjamin Ruben see the seven candlesticks or seven LP stand Standing in a rainbow over it was as a covenant it over it as a covenant and how he was appeared and how he appeared that's how he appeared and his voice was the voice of many Waters right both Christ and the church speaking together y see no wonder if she's the final voice that's right covered over holding again together with a golden girle around about the breast part of the church covered over holding the gospel holding the righteousness of Christ over the church that's right standing on the Bry Foundation R Divine judgment Divine judgment God poured out his Divine judgment upon the on Christ and the and he suffered the innocent for the guilty that's right amen or are you following me yes amen rainbow means a covenant so he's from the A to Z I'm all of it now go ahead and we scan that one 13 dou Church ages 54512 look voice of a trumpet saying to me I'm Alpha and Omega the first thing I want he introduces here the I am the first and the last the first thing when the trumpet of God sounded out he turned and he said I am Alpha and Omega I am from A to Z I'm all of it now stand and listen to me for a while the all of it is standing there now listen to me a while I'm not saying redemption's over cuz I didn't start it that's right you didn't either so we can't end it right someday it will be that's right and in the closing hours of this thing on Earth you can't hear this message from Billy gry on or Roberts right not throwing off on them you can't hear it in the Baptist the Methodist that's right amen cuz you got too much fault inside of it what they're bringing amen you can only hear it from the true bride of Jesus Christ but she will be the final voice you can only hear it from her him and her becomes one I thought we would believe we believe that we were his offspring amen all right do you understand horizontally jump to 15 and let's cut off one and go this is revelation 4 number 261 0101 paragraph 183 what would it be what would he do excuse me remember he made it with the Earth his color but now watch this rainbow only horizontally just covers in a boat one half the Earth amen that's all noise rainbow colored just covered
