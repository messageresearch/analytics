it back home safely and everything was fine but said they it was a lot of problems he evidently got caught into something and he even talks about um where they were sprayed stuff on them and tear gas and stuff then he had to leave in one place earlier so you can read the report if you'd like up here but you know but he did make it back home safe and said to thank everybody for all of the prayers and all of the the things that you know you know and that amen so Philippians 3 uh Wade's got an announcement to make where we kind of when are you supposed to meet again this afternoon or all right he's got something he'd want to say to about the festival for those of you that are making the little Carnival things we need to meet again in my Sunday school class after second service if you missed

yesterday so remember the the Canada family and we don't know of any arrangements yet of anything they'll get all that together I'm sure but we were I was listening to waiting in them because I was going to mention it and they were talking about you know that remember brother Mike brother George uh Canada brother Tatum and brother Moulton him and you know they sang as a quartet one time if I were you I'd make a change and sister Fanny Bell she played the piano for him so you know maybe they're doing that now you know got them all together in heaven appreciate the opportunity of knowing each one of them all right any other announcements I generally missed something uh glad to have Hannah bubbles back with us so let's see her all right so let's just go to the Lord in prayer and then we'll go to Philippians 3. the heavenly father we thank you for this day and the opportunity that we have Lord to be able to come together and be able to Fellowship be able to sit down and talk about you and to fellowship with one another around the word of the hour that we have we love you and we thank you and we pray that you just bless we know there's many missing today and we pray that you'd be with them didn't Gail there on a cruise and we pray you'd take care of them and all of their soul sicknesses and things we just ask you to take care of all of that away from all of the people and others that are traveling today in Lord and just be with each and every one Got Each one now as we read you a word you come and speak to our hearts we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Penny and Brenda are not here today too so Ronald is some missing all right Philippians 3. we'll start reading about verse seven we can read a lot of the others but to get a point but what things were gained to me those I counted lost for Christ yea doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I am for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ and then righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection The Fellowship of his suffering being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already obtained either was already perfect but I follow after if that I may appreh may app excuse me if that I may apprehend that which also I am apprehended of Christ then he goes on counting it all lost but he pressed toward the mark of the prize you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've got a I know there's two or three up here now of these new you know the things the uh come companion and there's three I think laying up here it might be one more downstairs I know there's like three up here um so you know get them and read them and listen to the tape and things and then you know bring them back to where we can pass them about Among Us remember me tomorrow to about one o'clock I've got to go for a stress test well I'm not worried about this test with the stress because I've never been on one of those things and the way my lag is right now I might get about halfway through and have to call a halt and tell them I'll peg leg on the other one or something but you know just keep us in your prayers everything's all right no problem there's something routine all right but now I want us to think on something it's odd the way Paul says it there in verse 11. if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead now that's a that's an odd statement it's an odd way of stating it especially where he's talking about now what does he mean so he goes on making it look like that he's done he said but uh I it looks like he's saying I haven't apprehended these things or come to these things all right but why would he say that you know when we know that he was a born-again Christian right all right we know that he was a prophet of God for the time and you know Church age messenger and why would he be talking like seemingly the it sounds like if you just read that without understanding that he's saying well you know I don't know whether I'm born again or not because I haven't fully apprehended these things you know I haven't reached a goal I haven't done these things but what is he really saying we know that he's not confused we know if anything we're the ones confused all right so now what is he saying to bring that out let's just read what the prophet has to say and let him answer this and then we can move on into the point that I want you to get go ahead and pull up number one which is the uh sardisian Church age which is church age book uh page 277. now he's coming down and explaining about the names and the things up above but then he gives that scripture you know of saying if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the Dead now this statement is most peculiar we all know that we're are all going to be in a resurrection whether we want to be or not all will be Resurrected so Paul could hardly be saying if by any means I might attain to a resurrection of the Dead see because all they did will be ready regardless good bad or whatever everybody's going to be raised he said the truth of the matter is he is not saying that the literal reading is if by any means I might attain to the out Resurrection from among the Dead all right this is not the attaining to the general or second Resurrection but attaining to the first resurrection no look what he's saying of which he said blessed his own is he that part in the first resurrection of which the second death hath no part all right the literal reading there the original says I may attain to the resurrection out of the Dead ones that's your original translation Williams says it like this the resurrection from among the Dead huh uh rockerman I'm just giving you these from different translations to the earlier Resurrection which is from among the Dead now I spoke on this back before but you know years ago I remember it but I want you to think about it the prophet says that this is not the general Resurrection but it has to do with the first resurrection and having to do with the first resurrection we know that he was a born-again believer that is the first resurrection right over which the second death had no part the first resurrection throughout the Bible is speaking of the Resurrection you know from us from Sinners to Christians that's the first resurrection the new birth all right over which the second death can't have any doing but why would Paul talk about an out Resurrection you know out from among the Dead all right when we know as I said I keep repeating that where you'll won't miss it we believe he was a born-again believer we believe that he at the new birth we believe the new birth is the first resurrection all right now that's not talking about physical Resurrection that's talking about the spiritual Resurrection all right the new birth all right now you remember how we were bringing out that what death was the death being unbelief right what's killing us unbelief well bless God brother Dale I don't have no unbelief well all right just keep praying for us here's a man that we would put him at a high Apex of understanding and put him in a place that we would all love to walk in the position that he walked with Jesus Christ and the the word that he walked in but yet he seems to wonder about something you know in the writing it seems like that he's he's talking about but but you know I haven't obtained to this well what is he saying what would that have the relationship to you and I because now I'm going to make the statement and then we'll move on see each and every one of us is standing in this same place no brother Dale I'm born again and I don't have to worry about a resurrection no we know that that's all right that's good but you see let me speak with Paul let me say what he's saying right for myself that Lord I know I've not finished the course I know the race is not over you know and I know that there's problems and troubles but Lord just help me I believe I'm a born-again Believer I believe I have the first resurrection inside of me which is a new birth and Lord help me to be raised out from among the Dead all right now I believe that points to this end time more than anything right you know I believe the situation points down to here because this is where the major thing remember what we were talking about that that the eagle was the one that called it death he was the only one that would bring it up and it would force you know come up under the fourth combat beast and and coming up to the four seal and and things and being the name of death I believe others understood that don't you I believe Paul understood death don't you but yet it was not brought out to call it that give it a name until the end time because it would be in the end time that we would really find out what death is right as I say then death is not dying quit your heart quit beating you go down to the Undertaker you know because that's not the end of the person because the soul lives on somewhere whether you're a Christian or a sinner it'll go on to a time and have to be a resurrection and a general and come forth and you know all right but why would Paul talk about an out Resurrection and like I said if if he talks about it back there that he'd want to be you know an out Resurrection from among the Dead how much more should you and I or how much more would it pertain to this day when everything is really coming to an end and getting in horrible shape all right let's read another statement and then get back to our thought look at number two which is page 356 of the lady will see in church age Church age book let me say this here I don't mean that God is calling only to the false finder repent in this verse he's talking to the elect we have some repenting to do many of his children in these false churches are still in these false churches there are those of whom it speaks in Ephesians 5 14. awake thou that Sleepless and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light now Ephesians is writing to Christians awake thou that Sleepless all right but they're born again Christians all right read what he's saying there are those of whom he speaks of in Ephesians 5 14. await thou that sleep us and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light to be asleep is not to be dead these are sleeping amongst the Dead now remember the other quote to be brought from out from among the Dead all right these are sleeping amongst the dead they were out there in the dead denominations they're floating along with them God Cries Out wake up repent of your folly here they are lending their influence given their time and their money actually they're very lives to these Antichrist organizations and all the while thinking it is all right they need to repent they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn toward truth now when we when I left the Baptist Church I didn't require that my wife leave with me I gave her a choice and at that point I told her I said I will give you money to go to the church you know gas money I'll assure you a way of getting there if you don't want to go with me I told her the same thing when we were at a church first one in this message and I said now if you want to continue there I will Supply you with gas you know your food your whatever you do that way but I said I will not give you any money to put in the offering plate of the church I saw that then that I had put my money in all of the years through the organizational system and even knew that in the Baptist Church back in the in the 50s when I was Dire and on up up 60 that you know that we were sending money to incite rights in foreign countries you say don't people don't do it no it's just sending over there to try to get things started they don't offend it over there to buy guns and do no it's to try to get everything to go and and you know but we think about do you realize that if it's not the truth and we've just read it and we're supporting that with our presence and our uh money we're part of that right all right so then he says await thou that sleepeth he said the people are asleep out there among the denominations well now I don't think denominationalism ended when the prophet came on the scene I think it really came into being as death from his understanding all right and that's why I'm so strong against um doctrinal issues that come up and I want you to understand you know but yet still I do not make you listen to only what is said here but I've always made the one statement as the pastor of the group I feel the the obligation to if I see a Doctrine coming in I'll say something about it why because if it is a Doctrine and it's a wrong Doctrine then it's death that's what I were hoping you would catching on to what I I've been preaching about what death really is death is really the carnality of our mind because that's what's killing us what did Prophet The Prophet say he said unbelief killed Eve that was death to her unbelief all right see then you know I'm trying to put these two together for you to think about something these that he said awake thou that sleepeth he called them bride right chosen people all right he speaks of an out Resurrection from among the Dead and yet we know that he had that Resurrection inside of him right man these that it says awake thou that Sleepless the prophet said to be asleep is not to be dead all right awake now that's sleeping all right you mean it's possible to to do yeah if possible to be sitting in a sleep not physically you know sitting and listening to doctrines and things and be asleep you notice a lot of times I've I've noticed this thing in my life when you try to correct a Doctrine the people automatically defend the one who brought the doctrine you don't understand you don't know what they're talking about you you don't understand you don't well do I need to understand or do I need to just wake up yeah yeah now what I'm getting at if debt is unbelief if death is unbelief then unbelief In You and I his death to you and I as much as it would be to a person has never even born again or anything see that's what's putting us in the grave right now I tried to explain to you the point I was getting at that see sometimes lack of information brings us to unbelief right you know lack of information in other words not having the ability uh when we went over to um the Philippines especially I remember them talking about that you know that a lot of Doctrine especially the two souls and things was really prevalent over there and they said we had nothing to be able to quote back with them so they would come with quotes from Brother random and said we had nothing said we were at the mercy of those who were coming our way but he said you know the people they said but God opened up the gate to where that we could get the message and see then they turned against the doctrines well all right now that I believe is what the prophet is trying to explain about us that we can be asleep you say to a lot of people you tell them well brother so-and-so's teeth he don't teach that why I've never heard him say that well how many times you need to go back and play the last day that I was sitting there listening and they said this right here well I didn't hear it I guess they mean it didn't happen you know something like that because you know but understand what I'm getting at to be asleep even in Lula okay in Lula you can be sitting right here and saying you believe the word and as far as what's being preached you can be sound of sleep and not have understanding of what that's being said I realize that that's why I repeat myself continually to at least to one point that you can have an opportunity to to check it out or to understand I keep repeating to where you'll know what I believe that's to the point would you say well brother Dale you know I believe everything you say well I think we need to wake up in Lula that's the main thing because if we don't wake up see then we'll go right on sleeping thinking we're right in the word now if you understand that point I believe that's what Paul was talking about when he said I want to attain and brother Branham used it see to an out Resurrection because that's the regional translation an out-resurrection from among the Dead all right there were already people back in Paul's time that were perverting the truth you've even got like I think his villages and how many years before I put the wrong words are you doing teaching the resurrection was already passed you know what they were getting at from what Paul said but it was their perversion from what they thought Paul was saying amen because Paul as I said he's talking about a resurrection here you read his writings he speaks emphatically of a resurrection because the day you're born again you're resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus well those two preachers just got the wrong idea what he's talking about it's like the people in the days of Martin Luther when Martin Luther protests the Catholic Church and said get away from them systems that's death we know what a lot of them start doing we're not burning the buildings I thought that's what Luther was talking about he said no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about wake up to the truth of the hour I've got a little message you want to follow this in a week or so about a Revival you know I believe we need a Revival all right he said well the world no no no see there you go all of that not a worldwide sweeping Revival there won't be another one the next one is through the two witnesses and that won't be a worldwide one that'll only be through Israel at the time right right all right but why can't the bride have a Revival I think of anything the people of this message need to be revived more than anything but see I believe that's what Paul is talking about he's not talking about a a resurrection of doing this not the other he's talking about this first resurrection that is inside of me I want to stay with that until I can fully Attain that's right are you with me I want to stay with this truth until I can fully Attain to an out Resurrection well you know what it was not in that age in that time for that to be fully made manifest right amen it would be down here in the end where we're at right see then and out Resurrection but like I say you go out and tell people who's right and who's wrong well you don't understand that brother I never heard him say that you know you're just talking about something you don't know I've been there for 30 years and ain't never heard that I only heard the truth preached well may I uh remind some of you that you did come from some of these places that you finally woke up right you finally woke up and realized that you were sitting there asleep to the people of this message the biggest portion of the people are asleep woe unto them that are at ease in Zion well because they're not concerned with any truth I don't want to hear it anymore I might get confused you mean you don't want to hear truth you know what your trouble is you might find out you're confused it might require that we wake up I am talking to Lula I'm not preaching I'm tired anybody out there is listening to their own account I'm talking to this church I've watched you for 40 years and see a lot of you just going to sleep you know just relax and just not that great desire and Zeal that you had 20 years ago but see you going to sleep just but see I want to be a part of an out Resurrection because now I'm going to tell you what I believe I believe the only way they can become a physical Resurrection because that's the next thing in order right is the dead in Christ shall rise first don't worry about the Rapture don't worry about the change don't worry about to being caught away be concerned with the right of the Resurrection because according to my Bible and the prophet we talk about the resurrection of the Dead comes first all right so if the resurrection of the Dead comes first Paul's right you know I've heard people make remarks and I don't like to make remarks about it but I've heard them say you know well in the name of church you know like and said the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first and said there ain't nothing no deader than that church you know and I don't like those remarks because that's I'm talking here all right an out Resurrection now Paul if you were living in our day what would you be thinking about I believe he'd say I would be thinking about the message that you hear you know from the prophet it brought us to a truth of what death is and what life is and and and the opening of the word to bring all things into view what are we like I was going down the road one day and was going deer hunting and and uh a couple of good old Baptist methodists in the car they got to arguing over marriage and divorce and one of them said you can't tell me I ain't right I thought you know that's true it's set back there we got down there waiting it was in another vehicle or something I forgot to have somebody come by and said come on I said oh I want to sit here and listen now they got a good thing going I want to hear the rest of you I don't care about hunting but see Church you can't tell somebody that don't want to listen right they don't want to hear you can't tell them all right now so then what do they have to do and I'm not de-christianizing anybody Heaven Help Me to ever de-christianize anybody when I told you 30 40 years ago that the most of the people this message would die and go by the grave before the change I never de-christianized nobody and never have I've never put any of these people of of doctrinal issues and send them to hell because of their issues and their doctrines I just don't agree with the doctrine and I try to warn you and I about the doctrine and the ideas he said well that was just well I wish you would have stood there 30 years ago and told me that and I probably would have questioned you but you can say all today yeah they're dying because they're getting older and 30 40 years ago there's a lot of young people in this message wow but you see Church an out Resurrection see to awake out of sleep and sleep is put there because of a um you know I like to read things and I enjoy doing it you know really why why you sleep you ever thought about it one simple little thing you know why you sleep because you're tired that's simple did that pack a big light bulb sister Regina to turn on oh no we sleep because we are tired and now you can be tired because of lack of malnutrition are you following me you granted that other part now were you on the grand malnutrition is because of lack of vitamins minerals food Etc right your body begins to dehydrate because of lack of fluids you know what you do you sleep a lot right the older you get you'll see you need more sleep but the problem is you sleep and then you wake up the next morning too early you got you have to get out of that part of it but but you're following me now malnutrition is a lack of Foods right when I look around to message people and go there and listen you know it's all I say and they preaching the same message they was preaching 40 years ago women's hiring dress and clothes and things you know and mainly getting on what the world's doing and what's happening here and whatever is being done dire and whatever's being done there and Pope coming out of the United States and you know same old things they were talking about 40 years ago well you know you can die of malnutrition but the first things that comes to you is to go to sleep that's a natural reaction from the body these nurses could tell you you remove the energy from the body and it just it just starts relaxing you know I mean there's no way to pump it up without putting more in so that's why you eat and drink I mean you go down to the doctor and you say doctor I'm feeling real bad well what I want to tell you to do just don't drink nothing for the next two weeks let's see if you still living if you are come by but make sure you pay the bill is that you know yeah yeah no they wouldn't do that away but no because you know that's not the way what you see most of the people of this message are starving to death with the books and the tapes at their possession and claiming to believe everything the prophet said and remember I'm preaching to Lula okay remember in Lula you know and how many of you were you used to that you would read and pray and things but you kind of relax and you kind of got a little draw for that you know and your church attendance Falls first because you know a car don't quit it starts missing right cutting off get a flutter foot foot and then it quits and that's the way people are they just start dropping off their attendance is the first thing well now where would you be now you can argue if you want to about this that or the other but where would you be if you come up here and I wasn't hearing you know well you're not the only one somebody preached to us well you'd have to get up somebody that day what was it like the other day when when we had five or six preachers and three deacons and there wasn't one in the building well who's going to get up and do whatever I I'm just talking plain I'm talking about Paul why would he say that why would a man of his caliber a man of his place in God of where he was and what he was doing why would he talk like I haven't attained but then he says but I press let's run on down below there I didn't read it but he said I pressed the word tomorrow for the High Calling see why would he talk like that sound like he's not interested in what's going on no I think he was just honest and straight don't you I was taken this around and he seen the biggest death that there was the disbelief of the people that was around him that now watch not the do it let's see where was that last night I don't remember it was on the tape or I was reading this morning brother Brown said I won't ever believer to raise your hand he stops he said now I don't want no unbeliever to raise your hand that's odd you know he said I want Believers to raise your hand pretty good point then True Believers but what is your goal well my brother Dale I think this that or the other I think we need to do this I think we need to do that well okay we try to do anything we can to help you know but are you awake in the message do you know what's going on you know that really to a lot of people that follow this message if you had a Depression hit they'd go Haywire because they don't believe it's coming because they've been taught that they ain't going to be no more persecutions there ain't going to be no more troubles it we're going to go out of here on a flowery bed of ease one day and just lord it's going to be wonderful and God loves his people and he's not going to let us go through no persecution I didn't say tribulation I put my words right well we don't believe in going to the tribulation no we're above that but we just don't believe there's going to be no persecution well what would he do if it woke up in the OR started home today and put your little credit card in the gluten it don't work oh I guess I better call the credit card people and you call the credit card people and they're not there it can be that quick it wasn't a life's depression that he didn't want the 20s or whatever was in there I mean see at least that these things well brother Dale that's doomsday stuff called God ain't gonna let his bride go through no purse no no no problems he loves her too much well I quote the prophet you mean all of that back through there went through what they do and then we're going out of here on a flower bed of these I think he talked against it but you see most people have never been told those things most people have never went through the message to try to determine a lot that's in the message you remember years ago when I called to stir among you when I began to talk about that California could go under and I'll still be here come on no we kind of want to go to under that we well go back to your profit if you studied the message you know that there was an earthquake at the resurrection of the Lord Jesus is that right you know that it was an earthquake hanging on the tree on the cross you got to get two of them in there you know they can be an earthquake in California can go under and they'll still be here that don't mean the resurrections come but they will be an earthquake at the resurrection are you listening do you have enough of the uh Revelation under the word of God to be able to withstand the day that we're living what if you can't get back home this afternoon what are you going to do what if you have no home when you get there and it's boarded up see people's getting smart and won't call names or states or anything but heard this morning that there was a place where this lesbian lady and got orders to be able to retrieve four or five preachers messages because they had preached against homosexuality and she was a lesbian and she's a big thing all right see I'm getting to where I won't say them so much because they're out there listening to this too you know in anxiety try to be a little smarter than they are all right but think about it are we at sleep asleep is the message well as it woke us up now here's a quote from the prophet if you'd like he said they fail to see or maybe hear or whatever the wording there The Awakening of the Bride well you know what there must be somewhere one of these days there's going to be Awakening of the Bride or something or maybe it's already happened and we didn't see it no well you know what a lot of people thought when the two soul hit oh what up we walk up this is what we've been looking for 700 version this is what I've been looking for people with the same ones that was over here moved over here looking for this right come on are we awake enough to really understand are we awake enough to really comprehend what's going on and I'm not de-christianizing nobody the two quotes I've given brother random is talking about the Apostle Paul with the new birth a prophet a church-aged messenger a great position but yet he said he wanted to attain to an out Resurrection from among the Dead going to give you the one where Paul in Ephesians 5 14 run around and referred he said it's the bride asleep in them denominations well there's no difference in the Baptist that's we're talking about the other day I guess you notice now you know some words just recently you notice now that when a move starts among people they don't put up a Baptist sign Youth for Christ worship sinners hey well because they're getting away from the name part right but now getting away from the name part does that mean they got away from the doctrine no no let's do that same Doctrine and brother moat used to say he said you get your coat and hat and just move houses you know all right you see Church I want to be awake not to looking for Russia to come down after oil I can see that yeah not to look a pope coming out of the United States I can see that we've already had it when you have a pope with what are we Western when you have a pot with Western ideas you've got a western Pope you got to run out of the United States don't go too hard but when you got to these people that do the wife is the head of the United States Kevin said that way without getting in trouble you know that Kennedy said one time he said what president said I just accompany her you remember that statement I just company the First Lady do you have to have a woman president when you got a Catholic President and had them you see what I'm talking about people are asleep they don't think about what's going on the first thing I've done after coming in this message I voted the last time for John F Kennedy found out we put a Catholic in the White House they voted since then all right you know quicker when I found that out you know what I've done I got into everything I could find see how many Catholics there was in relationship to the White House you know what I mean relationship just means Governors that means you know all over it's not just in the White House and I wrote it down one time back at that time which would have been about 19 in 60 869 and there were just thousands of Catholics already appointed to offices because that's what we rode around and said it one day he said you get one in he said don't bring the rest of it in you see then I'm not look for something like that I'm not preaching about that being oh that's death I've always told you I've watched this over and over you get somebody out of organized religion because you're telling them the religion's wrong they'll stay with you for a while but they'll go right back to a higher form somewhere else you watch it but you get them out of the denominations by the revelation of Jesus Christ to see the real truth they may have troubles and problems but they'll at least hang around all right but you see Paul said I want to resurrect out of are from among the Dead churches are dead he would be saying today did your Prophet say that come on he said when you denominate you die is that the words of the prophet all right see but see I want to be part of the Resurrection that Paul was talking about that I know and for certainty that I have not fully attained unto her that I must attain but yet I'm pressing towards the mark of the pride of the high calling at least I'm searching for that trying for that longing for that preaching about that and anybody that's ever here the tapes are there from 82 up or somewhere along in there you're welcome to go back and listen to them maybe 2000 now on cassettes I mean on the internet and see if I haven't always had one desire to preach the word that was preached by the prophet it was what the others had brought you know Foundation Apostles and Prophets and to be able to Proclaim that I believe Christ is here now I've got a little message and Lord will not get to it Wednesday night on Hebrews 13 8. I'll say it this way then come back to it Wednesday you show me one negative point I don't mean a sentence I don't mean I mean one word I want one negative Point thought on Hebrews 13 8. because if you've got one negative thought then he's not the same I'll get to that Lord willing Wednesday listen but when we come up like I did in and and trying to bring out you know go ahead with number three where brother Brown talking about what the Holy Ghost was given for but when we need it the spirit of God raises a standard is that right now he said when we need it what is he he's pouring in his spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave are under the altar of God as the scripture says a crying I won't know how much longer God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection they when the church in Christ becomes so close together until Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into rapture now I've quoted that for 40 something years when I first saw it probably longer than that you know but you say now God is waiting on you and I what's he waiting on us to do number one wake up right right you know it's hard it's hard to to um lose a person that can see you you get me I mean you know you got a person even if they're 40 40 vision they can still see enough to I remember no brother went up to brother would be and he was legally blind and he'd drive from Rogers almost Rogersville to Georgia legally blind you know and there's no way could he write his name he couldn't go by how to spell the letters on the signs but he could still see enough to see the sign that said 25 26 85 441 you know whatever you know are you with me what do you do if you want to hide something you take the night cringe you put it around your eyes and you lead them around you know and do and they don't know where they're at but if you can see you see what wake up open up your eyes I wish you'd defend me as much as you defend others I would be a very happy person but I realize that won't never happen so I'm not concerned about it another one of these days I was preached to you when I see about that I told my wife about it the other day just talk to her and wait a little bit about it something that the Lord's dealing with me about it'll come out one day but what about it the great Apostle Paul and all his doings and everything's waiting on you and I waiting on you and I so there's got to be a connection between him and you and I amen Lord bless God one of these days we go we're gonna we're gonna get that word we're gonna I thought the prophet's message was already here I didn't know we had to get it I thought we already got it you know it's in our hands well I just don't see that now we're looking on Wednesday night on that one I just don't see how that he could be among us and raise the dead when we're going to Rapture then you don't believe Hebrews 13. hey forget it stay on Wednesday nights you don't have to worry about it because you ain't gonna believe it anyway I made an announcement one time I said I wish everybody to be here Wednesday night and this couple came they said well we we heard your announcement I said okay but think about it if God's waiting on you and I when God can pour in his fullness and he can raise the dead we go into rapture I preach to you what I believe I believe the final voice to the final Age The Prophet says is the Bride of Jesus Christ I believe the voice of the Resurrection is going to come from the bride right well now how can it come if we're asleep how can he come if we don't know where we're at you know that brother random said on Hebrews 13 8. he said you say in a way he said if your pastor won't take Hebrews 13 8 get away from him come on at least we're to be like brother Tom was with five bush they come up here for a little while and one day he called the old Methodist preacher up and he said like talk to you know where he was going to church when he was there and he told him a little bit about the truth you know in the water baptism the one God and the old preacher just satire as nice as could be you know and he said well what do you think about that he said I've just got to continue a home with church tradition you know well now how much Blinder or sleep could you be when the truth is presented and we won't take that truth and stand on it to the basis of if he's like Paul at least let me press the word to mark it let at least let me do something to get out from among the Dead all right you know what he done got him out from among the Dead you know what Paul done to get him out from the among the Dead he preached the truth right amen you know what the dead left right am I true the dead laughed well Paul was out from among the Dead because of the way he preached the truth amen amen what brother ran him out of the churches then in these early Ministries and things that you can go overseas and get a big crowd but half a million people in one meeting over there or something within the last days he's preaching to half a dozen in a trailer or something you know what because of what he believed put him out from among the Dead so what do you think about it what do you think about the Dead when it's our doctrines that are killing us I remember preaching years ago and I didn't keep those they were there but well I'm back on the seals in the early Ministry somewhere about 79 78 anyhow I took the Book of Genesis and showing the white horse rider the red horse rider and the pale and you realize that because of the doctrine of Cain that's what killed Abel the doctrine of Cain killed Abel the doctrine of Cain that was contrary to the truth of Abel it brought death you know what then Cain was put out of the garden that brought Eternal separation right what about it think about it he becomes visible among us and we raise the Dead and going to rapture all right see now put to live few messages together about death what it is and how to destroy it how do you destroy this this death we're talking about the spiritually revealed word of God is the only thing that can destroy the death that is within us well why wouldn't we want to hear the word you know that should be our number one priority you know but listen let me just bring out a thought because already had the notes written but I want you to think about something that I said this past Wednesday night and we read where brother Branham said on how can I overcome talking about the ages that the preceding age you know inherits what the next days brings did you follow that or what thought did you have I ended it by saying that I was talking about in the finality in the finality you would see that fulfilled I didn't know Wade would been bringing to the Sunday school class A lot about the things and I hope maybe he'll bring it up here one day but you see your Prophet said it but I just don't see how now if he just said the age after couldn't hurt what was wrong then our minds would click but no he said the preceding age the age behind would get what the next age was bringing now we got enough sense to know that you can't line that up in the basis of saying that the the ox was greater than the man because it was not in that form that the man was greater than the lion it's not in that form I was hoping he was listening to a point I was trying to make when we get over there when this ends down here we inherit everything you know what they inherit too I tried to make my point I said we're not going to get over on the other side or get somewhere you know and look down and you know you don't have what we have this is the age when we have it all that's why I brought it around to the message that I hoped you caught where brother random said as son of David he said that's a millennium he said his son of Abraham that's the Royal Grant which is Palestine in the area sometime he said and the son of man said what did he do he said he lost the Earth and said he didn't hurt it but he said the Son of God in Heritage all things that sounds totally contrary that's the reason I had it written down to bring it out to make sure it sounds like it would be the son of David maybe would inherit all things or even the son of man you could relate to it but brother random puts it back the Bible puts it back Revelations 21 7 he that overcome it shall inherit all things and I'll be his God and he'll be my son do you realize my point was if we don't have the new birth which is the son of God do we have no inheritance you realize the new birth makes you join heirs with Jesus Christ according to the scripture the new birth puts you into that Son of God position so everything will build on top of that and when it's finished it will just be a pulling part that was my whole I didn't get to the license he realized what happens in that that if you relate those ages together and you time together and you just keep climbing higher and higher than when this age over here that sits on his throne do you realize the first church age is going to sit on his throne they said on this Throne back there in the spiritual form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're going to sit on the throne with him just as well as you sitting on the throne why because there's no difference in any of us there's a difference in the word of the age and what God manifested yes what he does during the times yes but I want you to put that in Hebrews 13 8. sure we've got to explain that this age didn't have the fully revealed word this age didn't have this and that or the other but I want you to put that in Hebrews 13 8 because you're negative you just took yourself out you're negative Luther's justification was the Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth of the time so we could inherit all times and he'll sit right there on that Throne he did overcome was hit me in my trunk we're in the millennium right on the throne of David but you know what he'll be son of God's son of man son of David Son of Abraham Son of God you realize today if this message goes to Israel he will first go with Son of God because son of God's a baptism of the Holy Ghost he's got to go that first couldn't go these two prophets walking out those two prophets has got to make those people realize the Son of God is when it paid the price who's the Keystone of it all the son of God that's why that quote I just read to you what he's waiting on you and I where he can pour in his fullness but the new birth makes us join ours with Jesus Christ Son of God is the Keystone of it all right around said the most important thing in the world is whether you're born again or not because it can't be no sort of man unless there's a Son of God first he said yeah he was he's done a man back down that's right and he couldn't give nobody eternal life come on Son of God Son of Man couldn't give nobody eternal life he could raise the dead he could heal the sick he could do everything but he couldn't give eternal life why because he had to give up that life for it to be able to come back into somebody for them to receive eternal life Son of God so brother Randall's right the preceding age the preceding age will go back and I tried to emphasize that to the when the Holy Ghost fell on the death Pentecost that was Son of God and everybody after then can inherit they might not attained unto the word position that some of the other ages would but when that age returns to that position do you realize Luther's just as much a part of the grain of wheat as you and I are you'll remember the two little shoots you see I'm trying to show you what death really is when you take death and don't realize what's going on sure Son of God inherits all things didn't say son of man in nursing and say son of David inherited who will that be that's in it's the rise in the Sun who is this son of man brother Brown said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Son of God and when it started it all before the foundation of the world all these others will come into being and when it is we will sit right there on the throne with him in the Millennium for a thousand years to rule and reign with him but you know what Luther will be there just as well as you are so don't you think he's going to be left out of it don't you think he's going to be well Luther you sat down over there because you're not in this if you're following what I'm talking about there's where you're dying you're asleep and don't know it because you don't know the truth of the word of God ever born again believer is a child of God a son and daughter of a living God and to become the word in the last days that we believe the fullness of the godhead bodily in the bride right amen but you know what that means it's all coming to her and in the end but a random covered this picture twice that the sun would become subject we call it sonship terminating but it was really the scripture son but come subject himself but Iran puts that in the Millennium puts in the future home I'll be glad to give you the messages one of those Christ Mysteries I think the others future home because you see the Son of God in hertz the whole thing that puts us to everyone right in there puts us all right to that basis of where I started off with awake to the revealed word could you just see Paul standing there preaching to those people that had come on over there later claiming to be Christians who wouldn't have been something for Paul go back to Rome and see them people like that you know if he could live when I won't come back wouldn't have been something for him to went over there and seen the Roman Catholic Church the claim to come from his Doctrine I think we need to wake up last thing statement I want to make is where he says from the seed not hour of the paragraph 10 100 and 101 number eight on your notes you want to put it up or anything to read it says the full word is to be born into manifestation again in this day the full word is to be born into manifestation do you know what we couldn't be here if Luther hadn't brought his message so he's going inherit all things with us see somebody's going to raise from the dead spiritually speaking become alive in Christ a wide awake and quit sleeping and well brother Dale do you expect everybody I don't expect everybody to believe because I'm truthful it's not for everybody this end time message is not for everybody it's far that predestinated seed the rest inherit what they get but there's going to be a people that's going to stand on this Earth and look death in the face and walk right up to it and say forget it if that don't happen we've lost the whole thing go ahead and go back to sleep go back to organizations and things go back to these churches that are dead in the understanding of the word and set our Glory Hallelujah all you want to we're in the word people left here one time come ahead me some people left here one time and the sister told my wife she said got to that church and that brother is preaching exactly what brother Dale's preaching you said well he didn't no I just say I don't believe it okay I don't say it ain't right I just say I don't believe it I have no trouble with anybody who's preaching the truth I can relate to the truth what about you I can rejoice in the truth what about you take on these things let's Stand Together from an out Resurrection an out Resurrection in the last days instead of just sitting down we're in the message we're going to church what do you think we're to be doing I know what we're doing I have no problems with that we're dying and we'll continue to die until somebody awaits and stand forth and says this is it now if you can't say this is it then what we get on Wednesday about that this is it let's see if we can stand that this is it I've tried my best to get people to see the truth of the hour and to try to get us an understanding of where we're at to try to get us awake to be able to understand go ahead brother 596 don't forget now there's a couple of books up here on the companions again and read them and then bring them back all right okay the spirit is groaning deep within it must be God here in my soul for I feel the boy I feel the Lord she has the two things Lord she wants to be awake so we condemn that demon under the revelation of the word of God the hour that we're living and we thank you in Jesus name I feel I went to hear the word she's healed we ask you to just touch her take away this pain Satan with Jersey under the name of Jesus Christ is pain it's He commands you to leave the body hey little buddy you've got a problem with sinuses Lord and just make all things well in its physical body and I begin to cry my little sister got bit by bees yesterday we asked you to take away the stinging and the problem in Jesus name some of the sisters come and pray with our sisters oh I feel the poor I feel it's coming from me Lord please bring her to the right place but we believe you we thank you Father let it all be free I hear the cross Lord please listen church is very valuable to hear the truth because it gives you something to stand on into a tape the other night and the prophet he was talking he prayed for a little girl I think maybe he might have prayed twice I know he prayed once her lady and he said now look at my hand said is it still there she said yes he prayed again he said now just look my hand he was holding her hand you know remember the hand assignment she said it's still there did your hand shows it he made this statement now listen to it he said it's not what you pray that caught my attention to me he said it's the faith you've got it's not the words he said it's the faith you got he turned around to her and he said now young lady said close your eyes took her hand that the problem still dark but he stopped and he said now Satan he said God called me to pray for the sick he said my commission is to pray for the sick he said now Satan you can't withstand that because it's the gift of God what was he putting it on not the words he said but the faith in his heart in the commission that was brought he told the lady he said look at the hand she said it's gone did you see the point he said it's not the words you say it's the faith in what you believe you remember the any statement he went on to make said he told me he said you get the people to believe you that nothing can stand in your way not even cancer the church we're on that point right now if you can believe it because it's based on what you believe put it right back into your lap that's what you believe if you believe the person praying for you can contact God you've made your conduct that's what you believe it's based on you in your faith Lord Jesus we just committed all to you now we believe Jesus prayed for us finished it's done we thank you go with us now as we go eat a natural me go bring us back together in you in Jesus name you dismissed the Lord please come and take
