[4:05] by the revelation of your word father we

[4:42] having a real bad headache today we pray
[4:44] that you'd touch each one of them we
[4:46] just guide us now in Jesus name
[4:50] amen Matthew 19 3-9 then we'll go to
[4:54] John
[4:56] 8:36 the Pharisees came unto him
[4:59] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[5:01] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[5:03] forever cause and he answered and said
[5:05] unto them have you not read that he
[5:07] which made them at the beginning made
[5:09] them male and female and said for this
[5:11] cause shall a man leave father and
[5:13] mother and shall cleave to his wife and
[5:15] they twine shall be one flesh wherefore
[5:17] there are no more twine but one flesh
[5:20] what therefore God hath joined together
[5:22] let no man put a under they say unto him
[5:26] why did Moses then command to give a
[5:27] writing of divorcement and to put her
[5:29] away he sath unto them Moses because of
[5:32] the hardness of your heart suffered you
[5:34] to put away your wives but from the
[5:36] beginning it was not so and I say unto
[5:38] you whosoever shall put away his wife
[5:40] except it be for fornication and shall
[5:43] marry another committeth adultery and
[5:45] whosoever Marth her which is put away
[5:48] doth commit adultery all right then
[5:50] we'll go over and get one scripture
[5:53] because this where we want to try to tie
[5:54] in tonight with the the grace that we
[5:57] were speaking on Sunday if the son
[6:00] therefore shall make you
[6:03] free you shall be free indeed you may be
[6:07] seated the Lord at his Blessing to be
[6:09] free
[6:10] indeed means there's no limitation to it
[6:15] now that's a wonderful
[6:18] scripture but I believe it would have to
[6:21] be here in the end time would be the
[6:23] only people that can fulfill that
[6:27] scripture and stand in that place right
[6:30] Amen to where that the sun can set us
[6:33] free and the Sun is the re revealed word
[6:36] right it's not just an idea or a thought
[6:39] or whatever it's the revealed word all
[6:41] right being the revealed word then it is
[6:44] the word is the promise in God's word
[6:48] and that's what we were talking about
[6:49] Sunday that brother brandham said he had
[6:51] the scriptures on marriage and divorce
[6:54] but he said that he would bust every
[6:56] Church in the in the whole world if he
[6:58] preached it
[7:00] and he said what can I do and the Lord
[7:03] told him to go up in the mountain there
[7:04] and he spoke to him and told him to come
[7:06] back and and speak it but he couldn't
[7:09] say that just because that he even saw
[7:13] Moses giving a grace to the children of
[7:15] Israel or saw Paul giving a Grace to
[7:19] those people in his day because if
[7:22] you're doing it like that see you're
[7:23] only taking the um face value whatever
[7:28] you would call it
[7:29] are the fact of reading the word and you
[7:33] say well now that word is speaking so
[7:37] I'm going to believe it's speaking to me
[7:40] well that's good we should do that with
[7:42] the Bible right but still just the
[7:44] letter of the word see the letter will
[7:47] kill you right amen because the same one
[7:50] that would tell you about the the point
[7:52] of Moses and doing it these men that uh
[7:57] had the greatest knowledge of what Moses
[7:59] had said were the very ones that was you
[8:02] know trying to tear down what he had
[8:05] said I guess or or whatever use it as a
[8:09] a tempting F factor to you know to uh
[8:13] tempt the Lord but now we got into a
[8:17] point our Sunday that I want to
[8:18] emphasize over again a little
[8:22] bit you see they had to believe in the
[8:24] days of
[8:26] Moses that that Grace was given unto
[8:29] them
[8:30] now I've always believed it this way and
[8:32] I always preached it this way I don't
[8:34] believe every person Old Testament you
[8:37] know back there if something was wrong
[8:39] you took a lamb you took a d turtle dove
[8:42] pigeon whatever you carried it up to the
[8:44] high priest and he offered it for you
[8:48] but see I don't believe now I've just
[8:50] always been this way I don't believe
[8:52] that everybody that carried that lamb up
[8:53] there or the dove up there
[8:56] whatever was
[8:58] forgiven you said well it was what God
[9:00] Said to do yeah but you got to have
[9:04] faith in God that's what we were trying
[9:07] to talk a little bit in the the uh Bible
[9:10] study the other night about you know
[9:13] that you can just make a totem pole out
[9:15] of something you could take the Bible
[9:17] and do it just like a uh you know cuz
[9:20] every Idol remember I was trying to
[9:22] explain every Idol that there is has
[9:24] some form of a high priest or whatever
[9:26] you want to call it a person who who
[9:30] explains the God you
[9:33] know that you're trying to worship
[9:36] whether it be totem pole or it be a a an
[9:39] animal or whatever and someone tells you
[9:41] about that you know and tells you what
[9:44] that means and how to do it all right
[9:46] well see then you can say well well
[9:49] we've been told about Jesus Christ well
[9:51] that's
[9:53] good but now is it a personal revelation
[9:56] within your
[9:58] heart if not you're only quoting what
[10:01] somebody else says you're only saying
[10:04] what somebody else has said about
[10:06] it and see then we covered then that in
[10:10] the message there
[10:12] that the message of Grace you know
[10:15] marriage and divorce is not for
[10:17] everybody right the prophet said those
[10:20] who followed this message amen all right
[10:23] now How Could An unregenerated
[10:27] person a person is not born again how
[10:31] could they receive the grace of marriage
[10:33] and divorce when they haven't even
[10:36] received the grace of the new birth
[10:37] right
[10:39] amen see we'd be just like the Old
[10:42] Testament people to just take a lamb up
[10:43] say here all for that I'm going back and
[10:45] live like I want to you
[10:48] know well see God said said I'm
[10:53] tired their their offerings had become
[10:56] according to the scriptures a stink in
[10:58] the the nostrils of
[11:00] God where it was ordained and made a
[11:03] sweet smelling
[11:04] savior well right now to one person
[11:07] what's he meaning the when he would say
[11:10] it would become a stink but they still
[11:12] going on doing it see I I believe that
[11:15] was to those who were not sincere their
[11:18] offering was a stinct going up before
[11:20] God but to those that were sincere and
[11:24] right their offering was a sweet
[11:27] smelling savior before the Lord all
[11:31] right so I don't believe everybody back
[11:33] there that said that they believed in
[11:34] Jehovah was as we call it in the Old
[11:37] Testament saved of the Old Testament
[11:40] form because God said said I'm tired of
[11:43] all this but said an honest and a
[11:44] contrite heart right is what I'm looking
[11:48] for someone to be sincere and honest and
[11:51] do see then if you went up there and the
[11:54] prophet actually you heard him
[11:56] say you know go home as you are
[12:00] are
[12:03] well if you wasn't sincere would that be
[12:06] a a Grace from God or letters from A man
[12:10] right
[12:13] see well I believe what the prophet
[12:17] says and I went over and over at our
[12:19] Sunday trying to emphasize one
[12:23] thing how can you take the doctrines
[12:26] that are among the message
[12:30] you
[12:30] know of the people and even now saying
[12:34] brother Brandon was wrong and even
[12:35] saying Jesus was wrong and and all kind
[12:38] of things now how can you how can you
[12:41] claim a
[12:43] Grace but it's like I told you that they
[12:46] everybody wants
[12:48] that especially somebody that's in was
[12:51] in bad shape you know had a problem they
[12:54] definitely want to believe that you know
[12:57] oh yeah I believe brother brandom that
[12:59] that that when he preached on marriage
[13:00] and divorce I believe that cuz that was
[13:02] for
[13:03] me he said I don't believe the rest of
[13:05] the message now where would you
[13:10] be you said well brother Dale you didn't
[13:12] really get down to a lot of Grace there
[13:15] Sunday afternoon
[13:20] you but I got down trying to tell you
[13:22] the
[13:23] truth
[13:26] amen see if you're not born again
[13:31] the Bible doesn't even speak about you
[13:33] other than you're going to be destroyed
[13:37] right right it
[13:40] doesn't you know you can't claim
[13:45] anything see then if we believe that
[13:49] we're born
[13:50] again that would be the basis right of
[13:55] all things in Christian
[13:57] real you know
[13:59] would be based upon whether or not we
[14:01] were born again to start
[14:04] with cuz no man can call Jesus the
[14:07] Christ
[14:08] what except it be by the Holy Ghost a
[14:12] personal experience of the Holy
[14:15] Ghost if we don't have the new
[14:18] birth then there's no need to even
[14:20] talking about the things that the
[14:22] prophet spoke unto
[14:24] us and that's why you see the people
[14:27] they want to go out and give it to the
[14:28] world World they want to tell everybody
[14:29] about you can't do that with this
[14:31] message it's for his followers only he
[14:34] said those he said who believe this
[14:38] message I'm as honest as I can be now
[14:41] I'm not throwing off on nobody I wasn't
[14:44] dire but I'm just saying it I believe a
[14:46] lot of people went home just as bound
[14:49] and messed up as they was when they got
[14:52] there
[14:55] amen because they didn't do it by the
[14:57] correct order of of
[15:01] understanding see the whole point that I
[15:04] made Sunday is if there is a
[15:08] Grace Grace can only be brought by a
[15:12] prophet
[15:14] amen you so the Lord Jesus brought Grace
[15:17] he was the prophet thank
[15:22] you he was the
[15:27] prophet
[15:29] Grace then has to be revealed
[15:33] amen and if it's not revealed what did
[15:35] we give it paragraph 272 marriage and
[15:39] divorce brother Brandon said marriage
[15:41] and divorce had to be
[15:43] revealed if not it doesn't have anything
[15:46] to do with you
[15:49] right he promised it has to be revealed
[15:52] until it's revealed you don't know
[15:55] it
[15:57] well
[15:59] has it been
[16:02] revealed or is it just a fact that you
[16:05] needed something and you was glad when
[16:08] you come into the message that you found
[16:09] a book or a message that a man preached
[16:12] that would explain these
[16:15] things how can we
[16:19] qualify that's why I put so much time in
[16:22] in emphasizing the fact of you
[16:26] know marriages and divorces and things
[16:29] like
[16:31] that because the prophet said he had the
[16:36] scriptures well if you'd have followed
[16:38] what I was
[16:39] doing and really had thought about
[16:42] it I was taking the
[16:45] scriptures and laying them in order now
[16:48] if you can argue those scriptures I
[16:50] brought I want to see
[16:54] it because I was bringing the scriptures
[16:57] and the prophet's message to bring it
[16:59] down to where you and I could read it
[17:02] and see hey there is an opportunity for
[17:05] you and
[17:10] I you didn't get the New Birth by just
[17:13] well I just fell in the message you know
[17:15] I just I just come along in the message
[17:18] no I like the way sister Gail said it
[17:21] she said I come in
[17:27] kicking
[17:29] see those that come in so real quick and
[17:31] things I call it burning like a candle
[17:33] where you at a candle you burning on
[17:35] both ends you know you're going to burn
[17:36] out pretty quick because you're going to
[17:38] meet in the middle as you're
[17:40] gone but if you come in struggling and
[17:43] searching and praying and
[17:46] crying then God can speak to
[17:49] you I'm just still oldfashioned enough
[17:52] to believe in
[17:54] a god-filled holy ghost salvation amen
[18:02] and we have to preach it for
[18:04] everybody right because we we want it
[18:07] that away but it's not for
[18:10] everybody correct
[18:13] amen now why is it that God don't give
[18:16] the Holy
[18:19] Ghost to a lot of
[18:27] people they'll say I've done all he told
[18:29] me to
[18:30] do I've
[18:33] repented I've been water baptized in the
[18:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a lot
[18:37] of people thinks if you get people
[18:39] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[18:40] Christ that automatically puts them in
[18:42] in the message that doesn't do it that
[18:43] just puts them at a place to where they
[18:45] can get started right that's
[18:48] right but you see
[18:52] then have we accepted the grace of God
[18:55] for salvation in the new birth
[19:03] have we asked God to forgive
[19:06] us of our
[19:09] sins or we just come into the
[19:13] message well my pastor says if if I come
[19:15] in the message I got the Holy
[19:19] Ghost I sure hope he's right and I hope
[19:21] you're right but I don't believe it that
[19:24] way amen I like what Paul said hey you
[19:28] received the Holy Ghost since you
[19:31] believe after being in the message about
[19:34] 40 years have you received the new birth
[19:38] right what do you mean I've been I've
[19:40] always followed the message
[19:44] amen so was they good men back there
[19:46] like
[19:47] Nicodemus gamea could you argue the
[19:50] point that they were great men
[19:55] right sincere men who actually he stood
[19:58] up for the Lord Jesus
[20:03] amen see how we been born again cuz you
[20:07] you can't start the bases of thinking
[20:09] about Grace of marriage and divorce
[20:11] until you're born again Christian right
[20:14] because it's not far
[20:18] everybody and then being that way is it
[20:20] just laying the Lamb on the
[20:22] alter you know well got to go back again
[20:26] this
[20:27] year you
[20:29] know got to take another lamb up there
[20:31] I'll go get me under gut another one so
[20:33] they just made it handy for
[20:36] him
[20:38] right you remember the ones Jesus drove
[20:40] out of the temple they just made it
[20:42] handy for them they could just go by
[20:47] them it wasn't no
[20:50] sincerity in the worship or
[20:54] nothing they had nothing into doing of
[20:56] the raising of the animal or the the
[20:58] keeping of the animal or or checking it
[21:00] out and they just go up and buy one go
[21:02] offer
[21:04] it I'm honest now I'm just I've always
[21:06] tried to just be straight with you I
[21:09] don't believe everybody does that is
[21:12] right I don't believe everybody that
[21:14] says they believe this message is Right
[21:18] amen I don't believe everybody says
[21:20] they're born again is
[21:22] right you know
[21:24] what oh that's that question Years Ago
[21:27] by a brother said what do you think
[21:28] about people I said I believe a lot of
[21:33] people don't have the Holy
[21:34] Ghost cuz how can the Holy Ghost be so
[21:38] confused right
[21:43] amen come on how can the Holy Ghost be
[21:45] so confused with so many doctrines of
[21:48] the
[21:50] message but you can go find you a way to
[21:53] heaven you know what I mean you can find
[21:56] you somebody that'll tell you you are
[22:02] right whether are they buil on trying to
[22:04] save your soul or want your money stop
[22:08] your money and you'll find out where's
[22:10] at
[22:12] right just stop the money and you'll
[22:14] find it
[22:16] out like I remember one man fell
[22:19] backslid and stayed gone for a good many
[22:20] years and come back and he told him he
[22:22] said you can't come back in Fellowship
[22:23] of the church you pay all your back
[22:26] tithe
[22:28] that ain't no joke huh that's right I
[22:30] wouldn't tell you that it was I
[22:34] mean it was the person interested in
[22:37] that person's soul or interested in the
[22:47] money how many of you would be
[22:49] interested enough in see a man backslide
[22:51] say brother collie just backslid and
[22:53] stay gone for five years
[22:56] and and he owes a few thousand dollar in
[22:59] tithe you
[23:01] know how many of you be interested in
[23:03] shipping in money to pay his tithe
[23:05] for to see show what your your salvation
[23:08] or even pay it for it how many would do
[23:12] that CU you know the way I am on money
[23:15] so you don't have to worry about it so
[23:17] anybody out there on internet you you
[23:19] think well brother Dale there money man
[23:24] now I believe in tithe paying is an
[23:27] honor
[23:28] that's right
[23:30] amen number one is an
[23:33] honor it finally comes down to be a duty
[23:36] it doesn't start as a
[23:38] duty it starts as an
[23:42] honor an honor to give it
[23:46] amen and God saying thank
[23:50] you then it winds up as we see it as a
[23:52] duty of Our Lives to where that we
[23:54] follow the word
[23:56] amen would you see see what I'm talking
[23:58] about
[23:59] church could we be worshiping idols and
[24:02] calling him Jesus no now brother no no
[24:06] no why Ain you getting upset about it
[24:09] you
[24:14] know you see
[24:17] church we can talk about
[24:22] Grace but now Grace is not disgrace
[24:26] amen we can quote all we want to about
[24:30] it being unmar
[24:35] favor that's what it is
[24:40] amen it's like I've always tried my best
[24:42] to tell you we don't have anything to do
[24:45] with getting saved other than accepting
[24:49] it but after we're
[24:52] saved we got a duty to live right we got
[24:55] a life to live and if we don't live that
[24:59] life then it proves we wouldn't saved to
[25:00] start with why is it that everybody that
[25:03] says Lord Lord don't get
[25:05] saved come on are we playing with a Dodo
[25:08] granddaddy God that doesn't know what's
[25:10] going
[25:12] on you mean he doesn't know that you're
[25:15] going to fall somewhere down the road
[25:17] and prove you're not born
[25:22] again but he is just to gracious God
[25:25] until he'd be like he was with Judas
[25:28] loving him and everything right down to
[25:30] the end right but knowing what he would
[25:32] do all the
[25:35] time see we're not pulling anything over
[25:38] on God this is this is not a point of
[25:40] trying to deceive
[25:43] him and if we're not born again we can't
[25:46] even talk
[25:47] about the message of any
[25:53] form Butz I thought we believe what the
[25:56] prophet said that you can't be saved
[25:58] without a revelation right you remember
[26:02] that I got them laying right here be
[26:04] glad to read
[26:06] them he said you can't be saved without
[26:09] a
[26:12] revelation he said we're on the same
[26:15] basis am that Abel was
[26:21] on and he said Abel got a
[26:26] revelation
[26:29] that it was the
[26:32] blood nobody didn't explain it to
[26:36] him he got a
[26:42] revelation see after we get it explained
[26:45] to
[26:45] us is it a revelation or a head
[26:53] knowledge Paul's greatest fear was that
[26:56] people would take paraphrase and bring
[26:58] it down that as brother brownon would
[27:00] explain Paul greatest fear was people
[27:02] would take what he said and just lay on
[27:04] to
[27:06] that and not go on with
[27:12] God that's my
[27:15] fear if you to come here and say well
[27:18] we've got the word at
[27:24] Lula but is that word
[27:26] revealed
[27:29] I've seen people here
[27:32] that they go out to other places and
[27:35] tell them where they go to church at and
[27:36] I wish they
[27:39] wouldn't you know what that's right cuz
[27:43] you go out there living like the devil
[27:45] and they see you living like the devil
[27:47] and dressing like all of those things
[27:48] and acting like all those things and
[27:50] then claim you go to church at Lula what
[27:53] do they think Lula is made of
[27:56] right
[28:01] amen but you see
[28:03] Church we've got to have that's what I
[28:06] wanted to get you there Sunday to see
[28:07] we've got to have that new birth
[28:10] first come on now it's listen to what
[28:13] I'm saying my carnal ways of doing it
[28:15] it's not believing God sent a
[28:19] prophet that's a secondary
[28:22] form brother Dell boy the main thing is
[28:26] whether you born born again or not
[28:29] that's it if you're not born again it
[28:31] don't do no good to believe it don't do
[28:33] no good to be a child of the Prophet
[28:36] amen
[28:38] right where does it save anybody being a
[28:41] child of the
[28:43] Prophet that's
[28:46] right you see
[28:50] church what do we put our hopes
[28:56] on
[28:58] but then I tried my best to emphasize if
[29:01] we didn't
[29:02] believe that God sent a prophet there is
[29:05] no Grace
[29:08] amen
[29:11] amen so it's totally dependent upon
[29:13] whether or not we can believe God sent
[29:15] that
[29:16] Prophet but the new birth is the main
[29:19] thing amen cuz you can't believe God
[29:22] sent a prophet unless you got the new
[29:23] birth or you can believe it in the
[29:26] head so does the devil believe that God
[29:29] sent a prophet does that save
[29:34] him he knows it a lot better than we do
[29:37] because he stood there and faced him all
[29:39] the time
[29:43] am but do we have the new
[29:54] birth but we say well
[29:58] you
[29:59] know well brother Dale I
[30:03] believe what do you
[30:06] believe as brother WBY used to say if
[30:08] they get you in with a hot dog and get
[30:09] you out with a
[30:12] hamburger you see the people of the
[30:14] message jumping from one doctorine to
[30:25] another when do we go to come down to
[30:27] the bases of doing this brother R said
[30:30] they looked those people in the eye and
[30:31] said you're not saying what Paul said
[30:33] that's
[30:41] right come on
[30:48] church if God sent a prophet then that
[30:50] means that Prophet was God's
[30:56] mouthpiece
[30:59] now look what I'm saying the Holy Ghost
[31:01] is number one whether or not you're born
[31:03] again but that same holy ghost that
[31:05] comes in you by the new birth was the
[31:07] same holy ghost that sent a man as a
[31:10] prophet amen you believe
[31:16] it the same God that comes into you and
[31:18] I and burst us is the same God that
[31:23] promised before the foundation of the
[31:25] world Amen he stand as a lamb
[31:30] slain he promised in Malachi 4 that they
[31:33] would be a prophet sent in the end
[31:37] time but instead of trying to dig into
[31:40] the things that he taught in the nuggets
[31:41] and polish them and and have a wonderful
[31:43] time about what he said over and over
[31:46] they're trying to prove him
[31:52] wrong now if I'm going to say he was
[31:55] wrong I'm going to be like I won't call
[31:58] his name but there was a brother he
[31:59] preached here years
[32:01] ago and he took a statement that brother
[32:03] R said brother R said if you can show me
[32:05] one time where I was wrong he said then
[32:08] don't
[32:10] believe that's a paraphrase quote but
[32:12] it's close
[32:15] enough he said show me one time it was
[32:17] wrong now he wasn't talking about 700
[32:19] 7,000 maray and MAA or this or that or
[32:23] the other or white horse rider before
[32:24] the seals and all he was talking about
[32:27] silly stuff
[32:31] right he said if a prophet tells you
[32:33] something and it don't come to Pi or not
[32:36] real then don't believe
[32:38] him you know what that brother done he's
[32:40] that's what he said he preached probably
[32:42] about his first sermon right
[32:46] here he just quit went back to organize
[32:50] religion well the only thing I say about
[32:53] it is if I'd have been him I wouldn't
[32:55] have went back to organized religion
[32:57] I wouldn't Degrace them that
[33:01] much you say Degrace them
[33:05] yeah cuz at least they're
[33:09] claiming you see me blackside you going
[33:12] to see this boy
[33:13] gone he ain't going to go back to
[33:15] another church somewhere else or do
[33:17] something
[33:19] no why because if I'm backl I don't have
[33:21] no right to go anywhere I wouldn't even
[33:24] make a good
[33:25] Catholic yeah but you can go in and do
[33:27] your penances and do all your things and
[33:29] they say does that make God accept
[33:37] me come on church we talk about Grace
[33:40] but what is
[33:41] Grace we say grace is unmerited favor
[33:45] but does Grace give you a right to live
[33:46] as the devil
[33:48] lives I thought we believed that when
[33:52] the Holy Ghost came into
[33:54] us that it was like Paul said it's not I
[33:58] that
[34:00] liveth but Christ that liveth in
[34:04] me now he wasn't talking about God had
[34:07] to wake him up every morning and get him
[34:08] to eat or to take a bath or to brush his
[34:11] teeth or
[34:15] whatever he was talking about the life
[34:17] that he
[34:18] lived he was talking about we're
[34:21] supposed to be
[34:24] dead we're going into invisible Union
[34:26] with it just I was going into it tonight
[34:28] and I when this kept coming I said okay
[34:30] I'll preach on it I can't I can't bring
[34:33] nothing but what he gives
[34:34] me we'll be in the invisible
[34:39] Union but you'll find in The Invisible
[34:41] Union when we get there that brother
[34:43] Brandon said a woman could be
[34:46] justified but said she can't be
[34:49] forgiven or forgiven but can't be
[34:52] justified let me put it in the correct
[34:53] order the way he
[34:55] bring that's right can't be justified
[34:58] why because he's
[35:05] guilty now we'll get into emphasizing a
[35:08] lot on this with it you know your whole
[35:11] husband's supposed to be
[35:15] dead right amen I mean we claimed a new
[35:18] birth the old husband is supposed to be
[35:20] dead
[35:22] right well what about us being
[35:25] dead
[35:29] you
[35:30] know are we supposed to be alive and and
[35:33] their old husband's
[35:35] dead I thought the new birth meant the
[35:38] killing of all of
[35:40] us you know the whole thing is supposed
[35:43] to die
[35:44] amen and I thought Paul was constantly
[35:48] talking about
[35:51] dying I thought that was brother R's
[35:54] message about dying to ourselves amen
[36:02] yeah we believe the grace of marriage is
[36:06] divorce what you do you say you believe
[36:09] in the grace of marriage and divorce yes
[36:11] brother brandom said
[36:14] it
[36:20] amen what do you base your new birth
[36:25] on
[36:27] come on what do you base your new birth
[36:34] on I know this Ain popular with people
[36:37] but I don't base my new birth on whether
[36:38] God sent a prophet or
[36:43] not my new birth is based on whether
[36:46] Jesus Christ came or
[36:48] not right
[36:51] amen then we know if he came then we
[36:54] know he sent a prophet amen
[37:00] amen it's like brother dick said that
[37:03] time about it they come out now and said
[37:05] brother brandham had 40 wives maybe he
[37:06] might have used a less number than that
[37:09] but he said that wouldn't make me no
[37:11] problem with me because he led me to the
[37:15] Lord he brought me to God you can prove
[37:17] disprove him on everything you want to
[37:19] but I'm going right down the road with
[37:21] he brought me to God Amen you're going
[37:23] to talk to God you're going to answer to
[37:25] God what you believe about it
[37:27] I'm going to answer to God for what I
[37:28] believe about
[37:31] it see then if a new birth is a
[37:37] revelation come on do we believe that or
[37:39] was it just a Doctrine or an
[37:41] idea a concept that we
[37:45] get is the new birth of revelation of
[37:48] Jesus Christ personally the prophet said
[37:51] revealed in you and it could be revealed
[37:54] from Christ of mystery to the most
[37:56] illiterate person amen thank you
[38:00] Lord now how can you explain it then if
[38:03] it can be revealed to the most
[38:04] illiterate
[38:12] person see what are we putting it
[38:18] on well I'm in the message I come out of
[38:20] the denominations
[38:23] brother that's what I said when I left
[38:27] I said I got out of the denomination now
[38:29] I want their denomination out of
[38:31] me and people just looked at me and like
[38:34] more what's the problem you know well I
[38:36] was trying to tell them what I was I
[38:38] wanted the denomination out of me cuz I
[38:40] didn't claim the new birth just because
[38:41] I came in the
[38:44] message I was two years in this message
[38:47] seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:49] before I received it and come out of a
[38:51] Baptist Church as a deacon at 23 years
[38:53] of age so you know I must have been
[38:56] honored for the life I was living and
[38:57] the the things I was doing and what I
[38:59] believed and cuz see I believed in
[39:02] living it back then told you about that
[39:04] old Deacon standing out there looking at
[39:05] some people getting off a bus one day he
[39:08] was old enough to be my daddy matter of
[39:09] fact he was my brother-in-law's
[39:13] Daddy and I told him I said that ain't
[39:19] right he said the Bible says look on
[39:22] God's Heritage I said the Bible don't
[39:25] say lust after it
[39:29] you see I didn't change a lot of things
[39:31] when I came in the message they was
[39:32] already in
[39:37] line we were already
[39:40] SC what what is the word fart we
[39:43] wouldn't let our kids watch certain
[39:45] programs on
[39:51] TV we were already doing that before we
[39:53] left the Baptist
[39:55] Church
[39:59] but you see church we put it then on the
[40:02] basis that that's my whole thing is if
[40:05] the people of this message are are are
[40:08] related are connecting to that God sent
[40:11] a prophet
[40:13] right and all these doctrines that are
[40:16] going every which way in the world to
[40:17] the polygamy to to everything in the
[40:22] world they all say that God sent a
[40:25] prophet
[40:31] right everybody says God sent a
[40:36] prophet well you
[40:38] know I sitting getting my haircut
[40:41] today she's a real good girl we've known
[40:44] her all of her life and
[40:46] everything and she said I said something
[40:49] about the end of the world you know and
[40:51] she said what do you think we're living
[40:52] in we talking a little bit and I told
[40:55] her about lady OA and what it meant you
[40:56] know and the way that things
[40:58] are and I said I'm just Wan the Lord to
[41:01] hurry up and come she said oh won't it
[41:03] be
[41:05] wonderful said I'm just longing for it
[41:07] every day well you know
[41:10] what he said oh no she wasn't because
[41:12] the way she
[41:16] looked you can look to the
[41:19] teeth is it not in the message the
[41:22] prophet said you can have paraphrasing
[41:24] putting together that you can have a
[41:26] long dress Dragon the ground and you
[41:27] hire dragon out your tracks in the back
[41:30] and that still don't mean you're
[41:31] saved is that what he
[41:37] said but you say we believe in the grace
[41:39] of marriage and divorce if we can't
[41:41] believe in the grace of salvation for
[41:42] our souls why talk about this body right
[41:46] that's why we've been here 40 something
[41:48] years after the prophet was
[41:54] gone let reading there this morning
[41:56] morning where brother Brandon was
[41:58] explaining I believe it's invisible
[42:00] Union we were talking about how that the
[42:03] people would have to be calling out for
[42:05] a
[42:06] deliverer he said it happened in every
[42:08] age out way he said the people begin to
[42:10] call out for a deliver and he said God
[42:12] sent a deliverer unto
[42:18] us what do we want to be delivered
[42:23] am are we calling out for it are we
[42:25] crying hang out for
[42:27] a a Deliverance in the end
[42:31] time no I'm in the message I believe it
[42:33] I'm just waiting on the bus to pull up
[42:36] well I hope you're
[42:38] right I just hope you're
[42:43] right because my way of seeing that
[42:46] always has been one thing right if we
[42:49] don't know which
[42:52] bus what does it matter if it pulls up
[42:57] that's all I've ever
[43:00] said well I'm looking for this to happen
[43:05] that all right praise the Lord
[43:10] right but if we're not in what's already
[43:12] been brought what good will that do
[43:21] right you see I I
[43:25] thought that the new
[43:28] birth as I quoted there a minut ago this
[43:31] is a
[43:36] revelation and and you can't be saved
[43:39] without a
[43:41] revelation I talk to prophet and what
[43:43] every other message that he talks about
[43:46] how that the the church is built upon
[43:48] the revelation of Jesus Christ is it
[43:50] just about every other message that he
[43:52] sometime or other mentions about how the
[43:55] the Catholics believe believe that it's
[43:56] built on Peter and the Protestants
[43:58] believe it's built on Jesus and he said
[44:01] I hate to be different but I believe
[44:03] it's on the revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:13] amen you know that he says it like this
[44:15] he said every
[44:18] age gets an opportunity at a
[44:22] revelation of Jesus
[44:25] Christ
[44:27] that's why it's the Holy Ghost in every
[44:29] age see then they come along and tell
[44:31] you the Holy Ghost ain't been down
[44:32] through there well where's it
[44:34] been but it's the Holy Ghost in every
[44:36] age it's in the church age book one
[44:38] whole message there about the Holy Ghost
[44:40] in every
[44:45] age you see if it was the Holy Ghost in
[44:48] every age it would be the new birth in
[44:50] every
[44:51] age and every age would get a revelation
[44:56] of the deity of Jesus
[45:00] Christ and I thought according to
[45:02] Revelation 3:14 which is the Lady of sin
[45:05] age that you and I say we're
[45:07] in the last
[45:11] age it says there that he's the
[45:14] beginning of the creation of
[45:16] God and I thought we believe where
[45:18] brother random was saying it in the
[45:19] church a book that he
[45:23] said this is a special Revelation in the
[45:26] last days a
[45:28] Capstone
[45:34] Revelation and that it had to do with
[45:36] the bride of
[45:40] Christ then in Christ the Myer he says
[45:42] it like this that Jesus is the center of
[45:45] the Revelation
[45:48] right he said he's the center of the the
[45:50] Bible is a revelation of Jesus he's the
[45:52] center he said and you're the fullness
[45:55] of the
[45:57] Revelation paraphrasing it if you want
[45:59] it I'll be glad to read it right
[46:04] here that's why we're not Oneness
[46:08] right see Oneness believe Jesus was the
[46:11] life's manifestation of God I don't
[46:12] believe it that way I believe on the day
[46:15] of Pentecost come into being a
[46:18] manifestation of
[46:21] God that Jesus Christ come to live in
[46:24] the church down Through the Ages
[46:27] and manifest
[46:29] himself and then every age would get a
[46:31] revelation coming down
[46:35] amen and then you and I would be the
[46:37] ones that it would be revealed to
[46:42] us or the prophet would call it in the
[46:44] church age book a special designation of
[46:47] himself were in his
[46:52] church a special designation of himself
[46:55] in
[47:00] Church see then you can see why we would
[47:03] have to have a Grace of marriage and
[47:08] divorce you said well I don't need it wa
[47:11] do we get to with invisible Union and
[47:13] you won't Crow so
[47:20] much see because if you don't believe
[47:22] you need it it's not for
[47:24] you
[47:26] if you believe you're so good then Jesus
[47:28] Christ died in
[47:31] vain if you don't need a new birth Jesus
[47:33] Christ died totally in vain it's not
[47:37] a it's not a Doctrine or an
[47:43] idea when we get in it you'll find out a
[47:45] little bit an invisible Union I believe
[47:47] Grace is a person
[47:52] amen cuz ain't never been but one Grace
[47:56] amen that's a person amen be
[48:00] person
[48:05] right but you see he's revealing himself
[48:07] in his church amen but to do that he has
[48:11] to reveal himself to his church first
[48:13] right
[48:17] amen see we want to signs and the
[48:20] Wonders and we talk about well why God
[48:22] is not among
[48:24] us
[48:28] it's our
[48:31] fault it's not
[48:34] his he's made the
[48:39] way I know that's where I've always got
[48:41] in trouble about it people saying you
[48:43] know God's not here well you still
[48:50] alive
[48:54] right
[48:57] but you see when you start saying God's
[48:58] not here then you're putting it in the
[49:00] minds of the people that God's not here
[49:01] and they won't believe that's
[49:04] right let me say he's here let me be
[49:07] with brother ROM to say that I'm not
[49:08] saying he's coming I'm
[49:12] saying I'm saying he's
[49:18] here 1983 right along in there when I
[49:21] got over that seventh
[49:23] seal from that day to this I've not been
[49:26] looking for the coming of the Lord
[49:32] right I've been looking at his coming
[49:35] haven't been looking for his
[49:42] coming if they in the Old Testament
[49:45] could
[49:47] look and cry out and long for a
[49:53] messiah and then us with a new New Birth
[49:55] can't do
[50:00] that what is this a Doctrine or an idea
[50:03] or another
[50:11] C see they're coming up with all kind of
[50:14] things now that where brother Brown was
[50:15] wrong here wrong on his dates he's wrong
[50:17] on this he's wrong on that
[50:24] wrong
[50:33] I try not to be
[50:35] too uh what is it is it an optimistic
[50:38] pessimistic I never did figure out which
[50:40] one is with one of them looking for
[50:42] something other looking not looking for
[50:44] you
[50:47] know but you know what the more they
[50:50] come up with SH and brother R wrong
[50:52] that's right the more I rejoice
[50:56] because I know that it is hidden from
[51:02] them man have to be blind for to say he
[51:05] was wrong he sure wouldn't say it while
[51:07] he was
[51:11] alive you think them Pharisees when
[51:14] Jesus stood right there and he said come
[51:16] up here and let's see you do what I'm
[51:18] doing come on he said well it didn't
[51:20] Happ well come on the Bible's are the
[51:23] prophet said just come up here and stand
[51:24] with me nobody wouldn't get up that's
[51:31] right but tell fares and things you know
[51:34] they went around the
[51:37] corner I believe he's
[51:41] wrong they wouldn't say it in front of
[51:49] him well what's wrong with telling
[51:51] people they're
[51:53] wrong amen
[51:56] Paul told people they was wrong and he
[51:59] turned around and said have I become
[52:00] your enemy because I told you the
[52:06] truth you're doing your best you can to
[52:08] save
[52:09] people and then spit the medicine back
[52:12] through your fingers that you're trying
[52:13] to hold your hand over their mouth to
[52:15] get them to to listen and believe
[52:24] right
[52:25] brother Dale you you sure did sound like
[52:27] our Sunday there ain't no hope for
[52:29] nobody there is no hope for anybody
[52:31] outside of Jesus Christ none
[52:36] whatsoever I don't care how holy and Pi
[52:39] you are brother R
[52:42] said paraphrase close but he said I'd
[52:45] hate to think that I was born five
[52:47] minutes
[52:48] ago pretty sure it's in the Hebrew Book
[52:51] he said I hate to think that I was born
[52:53] 5 minutes ago and have to stand before
[52:54] God you know some way to try to justify
[52:57] something or be something he said
[52:58] because I born in sin shape and in
[53:00] iniquity spouse my mothers going a
[53:05] liar see the first thing we need to do
[53:08] is just admit we're wrong that's
[53:11] right that's hard to get people to do is
[53:18] it right but you see you try to tell
[53:21] people the truth and then what did they
[53:23] become you know
[53:27] I told you about trying to save that
[53:29] whole church that they done started
[53:32] pointing out who was going home with
[53:33] what girl at night and starting into
[53:36] polygamy and I dug the whole thing out
[53:38] it I become his
[53:46] enemy but you know I
[53:49] tried that's all I can say I tried you
[53:53] know what I'd do again try right
[53:56] I'd do it again I'd
[54:00] try why because we need
[54:03] it but see church we need the New Birth
[54:05] the prophet of God said the the most
[54:07] important thing in your life is a is the
[54:10] new birth
[54:12] right there's no need of talking about
[54:14] marriage and divorce until you get the
[54:15] new
[54:16] birth if you can't get it settled
[54:18] whether you're born again or not how
[54:20] what are you going to do about this
[54:22] flesh what if you could get it straight
[54:29] would it be a great something if we
[54:30] could get it straight we could take a
[54:31] gun go blow our wife's brains out where
[54:34] we get maded
[54:35] again I'm free she's
[54:42] dead Mr see church what good would that
[54:51] do but everything is based upon a
[54:58] revelation Upon This Rock I'll build my
[55:03] church The Gates of Hell shall not
[55:11] Prevail if the son has set you free the
[55:15] word
[55:18] right then you're free indeed
[55:22] right well why do we keep condemning our
[55:25] if we're
[55:32] free the prophet of God said it like
[55:35] this one time he said it's first got to
[55:37] be the spirit of
[55:39] God and then it's got to be
[55:42] revealed and then in other words he said
[55:44] we'll see what it makes manifest from
[55:51] that see if we don't believe it it's not
[55:53] for us
[56:02] you see we're all illegitimately
[56:05] born what great thing can we take before
[56:12] God I never lied that's only thing
[56:14] you're Prophet could say you know can we
[56:17] quote him people don't like me quoting
[56:18] him on the side like that
[56:20] right you remember brother Brown said
[56:23] the only thing he had that he could go
[56:25] before God with the fact he never lied
[56:27] you you need that quote you remember
[56:29] when the little boy and he got shot in
[56:31] the leg and the different things and
[56:38] the and wouldn't that be something if we
[56:40] could all live perfect
[56:42] lives but you know that was the people
[56:44] that Jesus had troubles
[56:50] with I don't have troubles with ly I
[56:52] have trouble with
[56:53] preachers
[56:58] cuz the Lees will listen to
[57:02] you there's probably a lot out there
[57:04] right now that sneaked around tonight
[57:05] and cut on that their Pastor found out
[57:07] about it he'd lambasted them
[57:10] Sunday well all
[57:12] right if that's the only way we can get
[57:14] the word out we'll do
[57:19] it CU at least that way you got to
[57:23] change
[57:31] Christ in you makes you the center of
[57:34] the
[57:35] Revelation that's right you realize that
[57:37] he's saying we are the Fulfillment of
[57:39] the word
[57:42] right the new birth makes that Soul so
[57:45] wonderfully perfectly totally pure until
[57:49] there's no marks against it or any
[57:53] form
[57:56] Jesus said neither do I condemn thee to
[57:58] a woman one day go and sin no
[58:03] more but do we believe we're born again
[58:07] right do we know we were born again what
[58:10] can you put it
[58:17] on the only thing I can put my salvation
[58:20] on is is one thing that I've always
[58:22] based it
[58:23] on
[58:25] is that whatever started in
[58:28] me has never stopped revealing his
[58:35] word I thought the prophet said that was
[58:37] the evidence of the Holy Ghost whether
[58:39] or not the spirit and you agrees with
[58:40] the
[58:43] word now agree is one thing agrees is
[58:46] more than
[58:50] one see if what I have inside of me ever
[58:53] stops believing God's word or will not
[58:56] accept the Revelation from God's word
[58:58] then order to know immediately that
[58:59] there's something wrong with
[59:01] me I don't care who brought
[59:04] it who brought it had got nothing to do
[59:06] with it dumb donkeys or or roosters
[59:13] crowing but you see we want all of the
[59:15] grace of marriage and
[59:18] divorce we're
[59:22] free it's like I tried my best to tell
[59:24] you have for 40 something
[59:27] years a lot of people believe the new
[59:29] birth is taking care of their marital
[59:31] problems well then why did brother
[59:32] Brandon preach marriage and divorce why
[59:34] did he not just say your new birth
[59:36] taking care of
[59:40] it see that's why I've always tried to
[59:42] tell you what the prophet was what he
[59:43] come to bring he come to bring us the
[59:46] revealed
[59:49] word like I said a while ago he saw in
[59:52] the word Moses gave a Grace he saw Paul
[59:55] gave a
[59:56] Grace well I'll just take it on the
[59:58] basis of the word then I'll go out and
[1:00:01] say it now what would that
[1:00:02] be you want an illustration of what that
[1:00:05] would be if he' had done
[1:00:07] that there was a group of people pulled
[1:00:09] up in an upper
[1:00:11] room waiting for the Holy Ghost to come
[1:00:15] right and you remember the emphasis the
[1:00:18] prophet put on it he said they said one
[1:00:20] of them come up and said hey I think
[1:00:21] we've got it let's just take it by faith
[1:00:24] and go
[1:00:29] out he said but one of them said Peter
[1:00:33] or John or whatever it they yeah but
[1:00:36] it's not fulfilled what Jesus
[1:00:39] said you see what what I'm talking about
[1:00:42] if brother Brandon would have walked out
[1:00:44] there and said it's in the Bible it's in
[1:00:46] the
[1:00:47] Bible I say
[1:00:50] it that's exactly what would have been
[1:00:52] happening in the upper room they were
[1:00:54] saying the Bible is
[1:00:57] fulfilled we've seen the Messiah we've
[1:01:00] seen him die we've seen him raised we've
[1:01:03] been with him here and we've seen him
[1:01:10] ascended let's just take it by
[1:01:14] faith let's just walk out and
[1:01:17] believe
[1:01:20] no somebody had enough of God or
[1:01:23] whatever in them to say no we don't have
[1:01:25] it
[1:01:29] yet what about the grace of marriage and
[1:01:31] divorce what do we need it
[1:01:36] for we need it for these old bodies that
[1:01:38] we're living in right the old spirit
[1:01:41] world that we live
[1:01:43] in that is polluted by
[1:01:46] Satan and the best we can do by the new
[1:01:50] birth is to say the soul is
[1:01:53] pure and and
[1:01:57] clean but what do we get into invisible
[1:01:59] Union where the Prophet said you can be
[1:02:01] forgiven but can't be
[1:02:06] justified now what's he talking
[1:02:11] about but brother de if I'm forgiven I'm
[1:02:14] Justified well evidently it's
[1:02:16] not exactly right there something's
[1:02:19] wrong because that's the way the prophet
[1:02:20] said
[1:02:23] it
[1:02:30] but what about
[1:02:33] it do we believe God sent a
[1:02:38] prophet is our whole
[1:02:40] life and another salvation we talked
[1:02:43] about salvation through Jesus
[1:02:46] Christ New
[1:02:49] Birth but then could that Prophet that
[1:02:52] we would believe come bring anything
[1:02:54] contrary to that new birth that you
[1:02:57] already
[1:02:58] have or some did you know when he came
[1:03:01] and time because he said he met people
[1:03:03] with the Holy Ghost exactly like the
[1:03:04] book of Acts 50 years before him or
[1:03:07] something like that
[1:03:15] quote but yet you see a lot of people
[1:03:17] that have great signs and wonders and
[1:03:19] miracles and and Ministries and all kind
[1:03:21] of things but won't come in this message
[1:03:24] amen but you can't deny that God is with
[1:03:27] them right the signs and the Wonders is
[1:03:32] there well brother Dale they're just not
[1:03:34] dare to come not there for
[1:03:41] what I thought Jesus said the Holy Ghost
[1:03:44] will lead you in all things and teach
[1:03:46] you things to come that's
[1:03:49] right the prophet said he not only
[1:03:52] brought to them remembrance what he said
[1:03:54] but said he taught him furtherment on
[1:03:56] the Revelation
[1:04:02] amen do we say God sent a
[1:04:08] prophet who was it men on the radio try
[1:04:12] to get away from calling names but he
[1:04:15] said them people of brandom followers he
[1:04:17] said they're not
[1:04:18] ult yeah y'all saying it they're not
[1:04:22] ults because they don't follow the
[1:04:24] prophet you know the
[1:04:27] messenger but if you going to tell him
[1:04:29] he's wrong you know if you going to
[1:04:31] prove brother R was wrong don't tell me
[1:04:34] you're following
[1:04:36] it what I told a man in my house one day
[1:04:39] he come down he started talking about
[1:04:41] something I said why don't you get in
[1:04:43] the message or get out
[1:04:46] one he said you're not be that
[1:04:49] sarcastic I got an amen out of his
[1:04:53] wife she never did have much to do with
[1:05:00] him she said you're right brother D
[1:05:02] needs to get in or get out I said all
[1:05:05] you guys are doing is using Brother
[1:05:06] brandham as a foundation to pounce
[1:05:08] around on for you to bring your great do
[1:05:11] well that's what we doing we he swept
[1:05:13] off the foundation and we're building
[1:05:14] the building I said you can't build a
[1:05:16] building contrary to what the foundation
[1:05:21] is of course
[1:05:24] I'm an arrogant hateful old
[1:05:31] dude what's wrong with telling the
[1:05:37] truth I got hopes if I tell the truth
[1:05:39] what's what is it if you tell a
[1:05:43] lie he must hold you to
[1:05:47] that but see grace is what it wrote down
[1:05:50] Grace
[1:05:53] revealed
[1:05:54] now if the new birth is not a revelation
[1:05:57] then you can argue about all the other
[1:05:59] things but if it is a revelation and
[1:06:01] it's a revelation of
[1:06:03] what well it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:06:06] Christ it's revelation of
[1:06:12] Grace now if it's not a revelation of
[1:06:15] Grace I want you to explain one
[1:06:17] thing down to the ages when they had
[1:06:19] dethroned him off the throne and was
[1:06:21] believing in a trinity and yet God still
[1:06:23] saved him
[1:06:24] right you
[1:06:30] agree all right your you're Theory just
[1:06:32] went out the
[1:06:37] door see it was it was revealed to
[1:06:40] Luther that the just shall live by
[1:06:45] faith you know what that
[1:06:48] was what is a
[1:06:52] revelation what is your definition of a
[1:06:56] revelation well it's something that's
[1:06:59] previously
[1:07:01] unknown but then the cover comes off and
[1:07:05] it's made known that's a
[1:07:08] revelation what is what is the
[1:07:09] revelation
[1:07:16] of Paul said we're saved by
[1:07:21] what by grace through
[1:07:25] am I right now is that scripture do we
[1:07:27] need to look it up by grace through
[1:07:32] faith through
[1:07:36] Revelation so
[1:07:39] Grace is a
[1:07:44] revelation right Grace is a
[1:07:51] revelation has it been revealed to you
[1:07:54] the prophet said Christ The Mystery of
[1:07:55] God revealed had it been revealed to you
[1:07:57] this great
[1:08:06] mystery Grace is a
[1:08:10] person no brother that is this UNM
[1:08:12] merited favor that he gave to us well if
[1:08:15] it's unmerited favor like that he gave
[1:08:17] it to
[1:08:20] everybody well that's right he he just
[1:08:22] laid his hand down there
[1:08:24] body now you're going to mess up your
[1:08:29] predestination instead of going by for
[1:08:31] knowledge you're going to
[1:08:35] predetermine Grace
[1:08:43] revealed how then could it be summed
[1:08:47] up in the Bride of Jesus Christ as I
[1:08:50] preached 90s something sermons on the
[1:08:52] Book of Revelations
[1:08:55] and trying to sum that up with
[1:08:57] understanding
[1:09:00] that the Book of Revelations is the
[1:09:03] bride's
[1:09:05] Facebook or whatever those things are
[1:09:07] called that you all of you blabber
[1:09:19] on and the whole
[1:09:22] thing was revealed one
[1:09:25] person 90s something sermons to reveal
[1:09:28] one
[1:09:30] person and that was Jesus
[1:09:33] Christ but then to see where he come
[1:09:37] into the
[1:09:38] church on the day of
[1:09:43] Pentecost and then the Book of
[1:09:45] Revelation is truly the bride's
[1:09:50] book revealing the person of Jesus
[1:09:53] Christ
[1:09:54] and where he went to on the day of
[1:10:00] Pentecost sure he went
[1:10:02] up but he come right back
[1:10:07] down and he's in his bride that's
[1:10:10] right that's why in The Book of
[1:10:12] Revelations I kept emphasizing it what
[1:10:14] that you never see him without her and
[1:10:16] you never see her without him they're
[1:10:22] inseparable
[1:10:24] if you can't believe in the grace of God
[1:10:26] then what are we going to
[1:10:28] do but see he's already revealed
[1:10:33] it don't you think the prophet could
[1:10:35] read the book of
[1:10:38] Revelations and see that the bride of
[1:10:40] Christ is shown in beautiful
[1:10:43] perfect
[1:10:46] completeness with no flaws against
[1:10:51] her then truly he could say say I had
[1:10:54] the
[1:10:58] scriptures
[1:11:02] right but he was waiting on something
[1:11:04] like a personal
[1:11:08] revelation for two
[1:11:10] years I sought
[1:11:16] God for the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:22] Ghost
[1:11:24] reading constantly till I was called a
[1:11:27] two-year
[1:11:35] Theologian before I ever receive the new
[1:11:43] birth why brother all you had to do
[1:11:45] believe that's what a preacher told
[1:11:48] me when I made that statement about it
[1:11:51] he said well brother Dale all you got to
[1:11:52] do is believe
[1:11:55] you believe message don't you I I
[1:11:58] believe
[1:12:00] do well that means you're
[1:12:06] saved see that'd be the same as the
[1:12:08] prophet going out there and preaching
[1:12:09] the grace of marriage and divorce before
[1:12:12] it was a personal revelation unto
[1:12:17] him right he said I had the scriptures
[1:12:21] on it he knew and those scriptures go
[1:12:23] back to 6 4 in conduct order and
[1:12:24] Doctrine where he says if you'll catch
[1:12:26] it go on as you
[1:12:27] are the same W almost wordings that he
[1:12:30] uses when he gets to marriage and
[1:12:36] divorce when he says he told me to tell
[1:12:38] you to go on as you are and he'd already
[1:12:41] said back there don't do nothing till
[1:12:42] you hear from
[1:12:43] me he said there's been ways made before
[1:12:46] on these things read conduct order and
[1:12:52] Doctrine he
[1:12:55] knew but it had to be something
[1:13:03] personal you can't say thus sayith the
[1:13:05] Lord until it's the Lord speaking
[1:13:06] through you thus sayith the lord it's
[1:13:08] not you speaking it's the Lord speaking
[1:13:10] through you right you're saying what he
[1:13:14] says to
[1:13:17] say surely then how could he come out to
[1:13:19] say I say unto
[1:13:22] thee
[1:13:26] a revelation what is
[1:13:31] it see we must see
[1:13:34] first that by the new
[1:13:38] birth now this is the only Channel I
[1:13:40] know to go by to find out anything on
[1:13:42] the grace of marriage and divorce and
[1:13:43] I'm sorry this is just my ways all right
[1:13:46] if I can't see by the new birth that my
[1:13:48] soul is just as Eternal just as pure and
[1:13:51] just as holy as almighty God
[1:13:56] himself I said my
[1:14:00] soul if I can't see that as being
[1:14:03] totally perfectly pure how could I ever
[1:14:05] receive a Grace for the
[1:14:08] body and that's the very foundation for
[1:14:10] it
[1:14:12] amen as to whether or not we can believe
[1:14:14] God's word
[1:14:17] amen no wonder people believe then that
[1:14:20] that the new birth takes care of
[1:14:22] everything and I'll go along with you if
[1:14:24] it's what you're saying this way
[1:14:26] but if you're saying when that new birth
[1:14:29] is fully completely
[1:14:32] done I'll go along with
[1:14:35] you but if you mean it was a day you got
[1:14:37] the Holy Ghost 40 years ago or something
[1:14:40] and didn't know nothing about this
[1:14:41] message I ain't going to agree with you
[1:14:43] at all that's right
[1:14:47] amen cuz I've always taught you when we
[1:14:49] go out of here in a change of the body
[1:14:51] what can you say I am said I am born
[1:14:56] again Body Spirit and
[1:15:02] soul but I got a start in a soul to
[1:15:04] cleanse a
[1:15:06] place it's got to be thy first by the
[1:15:08] new
[1:15:10] birth it's got to be Christ in
[1:15:14] you before you can believe it so the
[1:15:18] prophet said the marriage of the grace
[1:15:19] of marriage and divorce what did he say
[1:15:22] it has to be revealed
[1:15:24] until it's revealed you don't know
[1:15:27] it now that's paragraph 272 marriage and
[1:15:33] divorce but he said it was promised but
[1:15:36] he promised in the last days in this age
[1:15:38] that every hidden
[1:15:40] Mystery in the Bible would be
[1:15:47] revealed that's a good quote to write
[1:15:50] down and keep with you all the time
[1:15:56] and say that it must be
[1:15:59] revealed not just take the words of
[1:16:02] somebody
[1:16:03] right he said well I'll take the words
[1:16:06] of the Prophet brother Dale you can't
[1:16:07] take the words of the Prophet unless
[1:16:09] you're born
[1:16:10] again if you do you're just taking the
[1:16:12] words of a
[1:16:17] man you see he had the baptism of the
[1:16:20] Holy Ghost you agree with that you
[1:16:22] believe he had the new birth
[1:16:24] anybody would know that and agree with
[1:16:26] it right well then the only one that can
[1:16:29] understand what he's talking about is
[1:16:30] one with the new
[1:16:36] birth if not you like
[1:16:38] Einstein they said there's only one old
[1:16:40] drunk Coots up there in the every where
[1:16:43] Einstein was at was the only one could
[1:16:44] ever understand Einstein
[1:16:52] talking yeah we all believe
[1:16:55] Einstein let me show you turn on the
[1:16:59] switch I believe
[1:17:01] Einstein and he talked to a finite
[1:17:06] Universe
[1:17:08] right infinite is that the word for it
[1:17:10] infinite I get my word you get it right
[1:17:12] out there and he said you look out with
[1:17:15] unlimited
[1:17:17] eyesight you see the back of your
[1:17:21] head that's what I'm
[1:17:23] said brother BR said I would have loved
[1:17:26] to been there when he preached about
[1:17:31] that you know the amazing thing was that
[1:17:34] that
[1:17:38] Einstein's theories and thoughts and
[1:17:40] ideas you know where they come from
[1:17:45] mathematics
[1:17:51] mathematics he said in that fourth
[1:17:53] dimension you can turn a baseball inside
[1:17:55] and out and never break the cover you
[1:17:58] take one solid object and send it
[1:17:59] through the other object and never make
[1:18:01] a hole that's
[1:18:03] right there Einstein's
[1:18:06] theory what if he could have got the new
[1:18:14] birth you know that Jesus came back so
[1:18:16] fight brother ROM said till he never
[1:18:18] made a hole in the
[1:18:19] wall you ever noticed him saying that he
[1:18:23] said he came back so fast he went right
[1:18:25] through the
[1:18:33] wall think about
[1:18:35] it they were talking out our Sunday
[1:18:37] about it we're in a day of such modern
[1:18:42] inventions until some of these preachers
[1:18:44] now that you turn on your your uh
[1:18:47] screens and things or TVs or whatever
[1:18:49] you're watching them on I don't
[1:18:51] understand all that so you put it all
[1:18:52] together
[1:18:53] and they got what what is that word
[1:18:55] hologram hologram and the guy ain't even
[1:18:58] there but yet he's walking all over the
[1:19:00] place
[1:19:02] preaching one lady went so many years to
[1:19:04] church till she finally found out it was
[1:19:06] one of those Holograms preacher wasn't
[1:19:08] even
[1:19:12] there come on folks don't look at me
[1:19:14] like I'm a dummy talk to these that know
[1:19:16] about
[1:19:17] it that they can project your picture
[1:19:19] until you can actually be standing there
[1:19:22] you you just can't feel the
[1:19:25] guy that's how close it is
[1:19:28] to
[1:19:32] Eternity brother M him in the in the 40s
[1:19:36] they were already dealing with being
[1:19:37] able to decompose a human being and send
[1:19:39] him to California and put him back
[1:19:41] together they said they could decompose
[1:19:42] him and send him and just couldn't get
[1:19:44] him back
[1:19:45] together that was in the'
[1:19:48] 40s he said what are you trying to sell
[1:19:50] us like using illustration like that
[1:19:52] talking about how close mankind has got
[1:19:55] to
[1:19:56] Eternity that's
[1:20:00] right and you know that all of their
[1:20:03] things listen all of their inventions
[1:20:06] all of their mechanical isms or whatever
[1:20:09] you call
[1:20:12] it
[1:20:16] Einstein had a
[1:20:21] revelation
[1:20:27] now he didn't get that from God brother
[1:20:28] Dale I didn't say he
[1:20:33] did Brother BR said you broke into God's
[1:20:38] laboratory
[1:20:40] Satan can give you those
[1:20:46] things if he can project a h a body and
[1:20:49] put it right
[1:20:51] here beside of me that you can't tell a
[1:20:53] difference sitting out
[1:20:56] there they getting pretty
[1:20:58] close
[1:21:00] amen think on these things what we need
[1:21:03] is a revelation
[1:21:05] am a revelation of the grace of God
[1:21:07] because everything we get is by
[1:21:10] Grace by grace are you saved through
[1:21:13] faith
[1:21:16] amen no wonder it's amazing grace no
[1:21:20] would it would it drop Moody then he
[1:21:22] would run out into the streets and said
[1:21:24] do you know
[1:21:25] Grace they said Grace who he said the
[1:21:28] grace of God he saw it
[1:21:32] amen marriage and divorce is a higher
[1:21:36] order now listen we're going to get to
[1:21:38] these when we get in the invisible union
[1:21:41] he said invisible he said that Paul in
[1:21:43] the in Romans in The Invisible union he
[1:21:45] was explaining he said this is not
[1:21:47] marriage and divorce he said this is a
[1:21:49] higher
[1:21:51] order
[1:21:55] all right now let's go with that new
[1:21:58] birth that new birth you receive the
[1:22:00] grace of marriage and divorce in the end
[1:22:02] time is a higher order of Grace that's
[1:22:05] right
[1:22:07] amen because Grace is a
[1:22:11] person took all of the years for the
[1:22:14] parts to be put together each each age
[1:22:17] getting a
[1:22:19] revelation of his Supreme deity go back
[1:22:21] into church and study that how each age
[1:22:24] got a revelation of the Supreme
[1:22:27] deity but you see church we get them all
[1:22:30] amen each age you go down through those
[1:22:33] ages and look and each age coming up
[1:22:35] they get more than the other when they
[1:22:36] just keep climbing climbing climbing we
[1:22:38] get it
[1:22:40] all this is the Capstone
[1:22:44] Revelation this is a revelation of Jesus
[1:22:46] Christ
[1:22:48] revealed which is
[1:22:51] Grace
[1:22:53] but we want it for the
[1:22:56] body we need it first for the
[1:23:01] soul because if a soul is not born again
[1:23:03] there's no need to worry about the grace
[1:23:05] of marriage and
[1:23:06] divorce there no need to worry about
[1:23:08] whether you can get things straight or
[1:23:20] not do you know Grace
[1:23:26] has it been revealed to
[1:23:35] you Einstein sitting there one day and
[1:23:38] something
[1:23:39] clicked he wasn't the first one that
[1:23:41] come up with the Adams and the ideas of
[1:23:43] the Adams he he he come into all that
[1:23:45] and understand it there were a lot of
[1:23:47] people back in there before he came
[1:23:48] along that had already dealt with how to
[1:23:51] do this and how to do this and how how
[1:23:52] to do this and how to do that and what
[1:23:54] was to makeing those machineries and the
[1:23:56] things that came down he wasn't the one
[1:23:57] that came up with all of this at one
[1:24:03] time you couldn't do Einstein unless you
[1:24:06] done what's his name that come up with
[1:24:08] the light
[1:24:09] bub
[1:24:12] Edison go without Edison you wouldn't
[1:24:15] have an Einstein see all of those was a
[1:24:17] revelation of the age of the time to
[1:24:19] bring it down to where Einstein could
[1:24:21] stand our and say yes we've got this we
[1:24:24] got this we put it together here it
[1:24:29] is can't you see that's what the prophet
[1:24:32] done I thought that's what he said he
[1:24:34] done he said he didn't come to bring no
[1:24:36] certain mystery he said he would come to
[1:24:38] take all of the Mysteries that was down
[1:24:40] through time and bring them
[1:24:43] together and to speak to
[1:24:47] us that was his
[1:24:51] message
[1:24:53] there's Grace this message is
[1:25:01] Grace because see when I see the message
[1:25:03] I'm talking about a person amen I'm
[1:25:06] talking about Jesus Christ come on
[1:25:08] Brothers I'm talking about Jesus
[1:25:11] Christ any of these quotes you want I
[1:25:13] got them laying here for you
[1:25:16] want but listen church if we can't see
[1:25:19] that we've got to have the new birth
[1:25:20] first then there's no need of talking
[1:25:22] about out of these other
[1:25:25] things because that's the basis of it is
[1:25:29] to be whether or not we're born
[1:25:35] again Grace is a person the person of
[1:25:38] Jesus
[1:25:39] Christ
[1:25:43] revealed
[1:25:48] revealed
[1:25:51] Grace
[1:25:54] do you know
[1:25:57] Grace let's Stand
[1:26:00] Together Grace
[1:26:03] revealed now I will tell you this a way
[1:26:05] ahead of time way my thinking is we may
[1:26:08] be about 6 months talking about
[1:26:11] Grace because that's my
[1:26:14] thoughts we need to know about Grace
[1:26:17] more than anything in the world
[1:26:21] Amen
[1:26:23] not just a quote or an idea or a
[1:26:28] thought but to have a
[1:26:35] revelation you know that brother Brandon
[1:26:37] was talking about
[1:26:40] David when he was facing
[1:26:44] Goliath you know what he
[1:26:48] had he had a
[1:26:51] revelation
[1:26:53] he had a revelation he said I killed a
[1:26:56] buer and I killed a
[1:27:01] lion said I'm going to kill that
[1:27:04] giant he had a
[1:27:08] revelation Samson had a revelation all
[1:27:11] he had to do is reach back and get his
[1:27:15] hair long as it was there he didn't have
[1:27:17] no
[1:27:19] fear you know when you got a revelation
[1:27:21] you don't worry about it
[1:27:22] if it's a true Revelation you're not
[1:27:24] scared of
[1:27:25] anybody that's why I preach with a with
[1:27:28] a not a challenge to the world but
[1:27:30] preach with an understanding say if I'm
[1:27:32] wrong come and show
[1:27:35] me but don't come with some little
[1:27:37] sissified baby
[1:27:42] Doctrine let's sit down and talk about
[1:27:44] the word of
[1:27:48] God see don't come along tell this old
[1:27:51] boy that brother brand was was wrong
[1:27:52] here and he needed to be corrected there
[1:27:54] and this needed to be done that way and
[1:27:57] I ain't got
[1:28:04] time see grace is a
[1:28:07] revelation or turn it right around and
[1:28:09] say Revelation is
[1:28:11] Grace you realiz sister Gail for him to
[1:28:14] speak to you one day you were in your
[1:28:16] kitchen and said that but that ain't
[1:28:18] nothing but one
[1:28:20] God that's Grace
[1:28:23] amen now you tell me it wasn't that was
[1:28:31] Grace
[1:28:32] Grace is a revelation of a
[1:28:36] person that person is Jesus
[1:28:41] Christ you know without the grace of God
[1:28:43] we couldn't believe that God sent a
[1:28:45] prophet we couldn't believe in Jesus
[1:28:47] Christ being our savior CU you know what
[1:28:50] you're asked to do
[1:28:52] in Salvation you realize you're asked to
[1:28:54] believe something that you can't
[1:28:59] prove you can't prove D that you're
[1:29:01] saved there's good people in the world
[1:29:04] you can't prove you're saved that
[1:29:07] way now somebody that maybe knowed you
[1:29:10] before and then send you now you sure
[1:29:12] have a lot of convincing to it but you

[1:29:43] works
[1:29:44] and when Abel had a revelation it was by
[1:29:48] Faith by the

[1:41:56] hold over and typ and this and that the
[1:41:58] other I'm sorry I made that mistake but

[1:42:03] mistake I said Lord I said don't blame
[1:42:07] the people that's there in the church
[1:42:08] for this it was my
[1:42:11] mistake there's any problems you blame
[1:42:15] me well that sounds good don't
[1:42:18] it good old holy r just fell her on
[1:42:24] it the Lord spoke to me as audibly as

[1:42:31] said if I done
[1:42:33] that said where would there be anything
[1:42:36] I
[1:42:37] done oh I
[1:42:40] cried cuz that old self-righteous
[1:42:42] hypocrite

[1:42:49] help
[1:42:51] he said if I let you do that I I
[1:42:54] couldn't claim it i' done
[1:42:55] it I said you're right forgive me Lord
[1:43:00] for being an ignorant
[1:43:02] person and you just put that to the
[1:43:04] point of saying that through the blood
[1:43:06] of Jesus Christ we I messed up now you
[1:43:10] make everything all
[1:43:12] right cuz see we're supposed to be
[1:43:15] serious it's not a play pry we don't
[1:43:18] drive and come to church and do all the
[1:43:20] things and dedicate our life to the Lord
[1:43:22] just for some
[1:43:27] silliness but we believe that God is
[1:43:32] real he can take care of
[1:43:36] us one more step we could be turned back
[1:43:39] to a young man and a young
[1:43:41] woman no problem one more
[1:43:46] step but until that time comes what are
[1:43:48] we going to do grip and complaint

[1:44:00] Lord I'm
[1:44:02] Healed you know if you want the
[1:44:04] revelations I got to lay them on my day

[1:44:08] front of me brother R said that's where
[1:44:09] we mess up on healings and
[1:44:12] things he said we need to thank God for
[1:44:15] that healing and accept it by faith and
[1:44:18] believe but ask him to reveal to us that
[1:44:21] we're healed he said when he shows you
[1:44:23] you're healed by Revelation he said
[1:44:25] you'll challenge the
[1:44:28] world you care not what the doctors or
[1:44:31] anybody has to
[1:44:35] say because you
[1:44:39] believe I told you about the doctor when

[1:45:06] it's
[1:45:08] revealed Butz it's just vain vain
[1:45:10] jangling of words it could be
[1:45:11] identically the truth we read the Bible
[1:45:14] before we found the truth that was in it
[1:45:16] didn't we we believed it was telling us
[1:45:18] the truth didn't we but then we found
[1:45:20] that our reading was what was wrong not
[1:45:22] the words on the page it what went in
[1:45:25] our ears as a
[1:45:27] hearing that God said it
[1:45:31] right thank Father dismiss everybody
[1:45:35] Lord and give us a safe journey on the
[1:45:36] way home and let your grace be on the
[1:45:38] wheels of all the vehicles Lord and let

[1:45:43] us and give us understanding we love you
[1:45:46] and we thank you in Jesus name amen you
