TRANSCRIPT
========================================
level right we all come from the same place born in sand shape of their iniquity now listen it's not that uh you know you can get dogmatic about certain things about life and all these things but like me and Jim was talking about yesterday we we all live in permissive wealth all of us live in the permissive will of God God never intended for us number one to come by saying right number two he never intended us to get old all right he never intended for us to sin in fact Genesis 1 26 man never did Sin right so we got to look to that image um and we were talking about you know some people are real dogmatic about this flesh right here is what's going to be redeemed well that's correct but my flesh at 20 years old and your flesh at 20 years old had earrings in it some of you had tattoos do you understand what I'm saying so let's not be so dogmatic we got to go back to that exact 20 year old body that we lived in when we were 20 years old because if you do you're in trouble some of you yeah we had long hair guys girls Jim's hair was the shortest mine when she was 20 years old so we're not going back to that we're going we're going to that Genesis 1 26 man because when God picture you before the foundation of the world at 20 years old like you probably said he didn't take a picture you at 20 years old right here if he would you'd have short hair you'd have had tattoos you would have had earrings you'd have had it you know they got piercings everywhere now but was that what God saw there's no way you could see that right so brother Brown said you're being you were being built into the image of the one that's inside of you right that's right that picture brother that picture that God took of you that brother Brown told us about that God saw come straight from his mind which was perfect right so brother Brown you could say brother Brown said well not exactly the same gases well you know what his labor lahanta said one time and I don't know how I'm gonna get in with this but there's more of you in the septic tank than there is standing up right here My Flesh when I take a shower is proven every seven years your body goes through a change your skin cells come off with you and go into the toilet I mean into the sewer and out into the water out into the ground now is all that going to collect back and let's don't be so dogmatic this don't be so dogmatic about that that boy this right here is you know if I was just flesh and blood will not enter into the kingdom of animals right 16 elements of the Earth absolutely I'm gonna look the way I look but remember what brother Brown said brother Adam said God took this one and bred them to this one this one to this one right this one to this one this one to this one to get you here why because he saw you before the foundation of the world he knew what your genetic makeup was going to be so he he had the picture so we put this one together to make Bob black look the way Bob black is and he comes right down here he is on the Earth to make his choice but let's don't be so dogmatic when somebody you know says well well it's not exactly this body or somebody says well it's got to be this Exotic Body well if you're standing here for the change this body is going to be changed now I promise you one thing sister's not gonna have holes in your ears that's right so what is it is a new body that's right but it's this body made new not throwing this body away and picking up a new one there's no way because this is redeemed right here this is the Redemption Genesis 126 man don't need to be redeemed he never needed Redemption he always was eternal right he never was born on a certain day he never did Sin that's right but we did in this body this flesh this is what needs Redemption yes now he's going to redeem me back to the 20 year old I was no he's going to redeem me back to the 20 year old he saw that's right that I was that's right did God take a picture what we will be when we are changed really the picture listen the picture is that that's what I've been trying to preach to you about that Genesis one man if you ever see that you're going to see full Redemption because that Genesis 1 26 man never changed right it come genetically from the mind of God and the DNA of God is exactly that Genesis 1 26 man what God had him in his mind it will not ever change how can God change his mind so when he said I will create man in my image he created that 20 year old well that's good you want to share them while it's fresh well I just saw what when brother Dale says God is a you know he's a man I mean he's a person when you say that I thought you said and remember God's attribution male and female you said he was made in that when everybody was made in the image of God I thought well the image is like a picture I mean that's right so that meant God was right right God's always been a human God's always been young God's not some great-headed like the world thinks it got some gray-headed I don't want a god like that if he's going to change me back I want him to be young yeah yeah you see that's why Mary Magdalene didn't know Jesus had never seen Jesus at 20 years old right that's why Mary looked and said what have you done with my lord well she thought he was just a little old Garden a little 20 year old guy why do you think the disciples had a problem believing who he was he didn't say look at my face he said look at my hands and my feet that was the to show them Hey listen we may get awful let's get off on this for a second he appears to Peter Peter was his right hand man he said Peter you got the Keys of the Kingdom right right did he tell him he said whatever you're buying on Earth I'll buy it in heaven whenever you lose Peter sees Jesus after the resurrection and read your Bible Peter gets up and goes fishing read the Bible Peter gets up and goes fish did he really believe who that was if he really believed that that man had been there raised from the dead and now we're standing among them I'd be around that man so much you couldn't keep me away from him right Peter didn't have a revelation because it he wasn't looking at the Jesus he knew everybody understand what I'm saying because Jesus was 20 years old he wasn't an old man yes yes he wasn't 33 he wouldn't didn't look 50. he was a young man that's God was young when God walked through the garden with Adam and him here's Adam and he's standing in their profession and here's God going good to see you all this morning y'all had a good day no he was down there rejoicing with him Adam could look at God and look at himself and said hey I was made in that man's image I don't believe Adam was a 40 year old man I believe he's a 20 year old man my brother around 820 Prime of Life all right that's your Prime of life and if you're not born again that's the whole thing when brother Branham says when a sinner dies he resurrects in the body he sinned in right now wait a minute we stand in this body what's the difference in me and them what's the difference in you and the Sarah you had a change from the inside right that's right that Genesis 1 26 man came and connected with you that's right that's why you're molding into that image everybody get that you're molded into that Genesis one image like Jim and I were talking that you know you don't I was going out on the internet but you don't want to preach it but you are actually two people you're the person your Mom and Daddy brought here okay and if you're born again you have the person of almighty God in your soul brother said it's you and him together as persons right right because remember this is my eye God gave it to me so this is my new birth when God gives me the new birth it's mine right because God's not an enemy giver's not gonna take it back that's right but what's happening is now I'm gonna am I going to be changed to a 50 year old man no there's one inside of me that's 20 years old that's right and it's not up you under somewhere my theophany is not wading up yonder it's waiting right here amen everybody believes that we believe that in this church the theophany is right here it ain't over under it ain't brother Brown says 20 feet from you but what is he talking about dimension dimensional change but then Genesis 1 26 man that came to me at my new birth it's a 20 year old man that's why I tell old people they look at me and they look at me kind of funny then I say you're younger than I am because he's had he or she is heading toward that new body that's right and if I live on in the world you know the world doesn't come to an end if I live on I'm going to get older and then head toward that new body but a lot of people that are you know in their 80s and 90s I'll tell them I say you're younger than I am because it's inside that's right it got trapped brother Brown said we were trapped into this what we were trapped in the best everybody understand that we were trapped in this yes this is the Trap is that we came by sacks yes and then we have to die and go by the grave sure we don't have to you understand what I mean we take a body change here but for most of the ones that went on and I'm sure listen I believe in an empty grave I believe they're gonna the graves are gonna be empty because if Jesus had an empty tomb you go by the grave you're gonna have an empty tank but listen it's not going to be like the World shows mounds of dirt coming up that's right Jesus proved in a glorified body he could walk through the wall so there's people those people are going to be changed brother Ryan's going to come up out of that grave and it's not going to be a mark left there's not gonna be any dirt have to be moved my Lord why he has become what the Creator he said he was going to be that's what we got to start believing in whether death takes us or whether sorrow sickness whatever we got what's inside of us is eternal that's my brother answer the new birth is the most important thing in the world that's right not just having a good feeling that's right not just having a good you're a good atmosphere and don't get born again get to where God is your desire right exactly and that's your desire is to serve him and your desire right your desires to the word the word of God because what that's what this right here doesn't this right here doesn't feed off of this we have to make this come under subjection that's right that's why we're talking about the Statue of a perfect man once we get born again we're still fighting this old nature that Mom and Daddy brought her body into the world we got a fallen nature that's right you gotta fall in nature so even when we get born again it's like that capsule I was telling you about God is encapsulated in your body if you're born again and he's trying to get out that's right well now he's not going to get out as a 50 year old he's that 20 year old that God saw before the foundation of the world he saw it perfect and that's what God's looking at that's true remember God can't see us that's right he sees the blood covering he hears our voice amen because brother Brown said if he saw you for one second he'd have to kill you why because this right here can inherit the Kingdom of Heaven right as I'm standing here today this can't inherit this won't go in another dimension that's right I have to be changed because that Genesis 1 Came From Another Dimension that's right and if it came from another dimension it can go back to another dimension that's why Jesus said I come from God and I can go back to God right because I came out of that Dimension into this Dimension and now I can take this Dimension and what I'm going to do is I'm going to pick up the glorified body this is being changed it has to be changed I do not believe in getting a new one as some people say this thrown away and then appears a new body no I'm connected to this thing right here right but let's don't be so dogmatic that it's going to be this body when it was 20 years old there's no way right does everybody understand that yes there's no way that can happen because brother Brown said not exactly the same gases because if you die gases are released like I said you're going most of you is in the septic tank right now so God can gather all that back up but that's just natural living that's just life and and the things that we do of this of this flesh um you know have a relations with your wife and your husband that's you know it's permitted by God and except you know God tells you the bed's undefiled so don't worry about that but we must keep this thing right here under subjection to the things of the world that's right okay we live in the world but not all of the world that's right social truly is correct and that was my next point it's got to come from but you got to take it from that mental concept that's what this is this is you got to get it mental first mental concept down to a spiritual revelation because this can never live it remember Satan chose this God chose this right right why but it's not your heart that's beaten and thumping no no it's the heart of you that Genesis one man I'm trying to tell you about because if you don't get that man changed first don't worry about what we're going to talk about Statue of purple man you get that man's inside you get that soul burn out the things of the world and get God inside there and then let him do the work do you have a hand that yeah yeah people say to you uh in your body right right so you're not this was somebody redeemed that's right not a lot of people in this message but you're gonna throw this body yeah nope it's not and I got a quote but I don't didn't bring it around said I'll raise in the body I lived in okay that's good enough for me right well what's good enough for me is that Jesus wrote now remember it wasn't the 33 year old looking body he came out of the ground with you understand what I'm saying it was 20. so it wasn't the same body you see what terminology will get you you say well it was exactly the same well no it didn't look like 33 year old with the with the I mean man look at what he went through yeah look what he went through at the cross the beaten they pulled his beard out now listen that one didn't come out of the Grave that's right that was changed his face would have been bleeding he'd have bruises all over his body the only thing he had was those sign of redemption he paid the price that's right he had died amen he had Rose he had paid the price but that body had been changed back to a 20 year old you know what if Adam would have been standing there in the garden that day he would have said hey daddy okay that's good is that okay he would have said hey Daddy because he knew that man at 20 years old gospel often he doesn't change that's right he stays the same all the way down through I I I'm telling you God don't have a Gray beard and need a walking stick he's not that way I'm not going back to that everybody understands the same man hey man Mr Marvel I just wanted you know that I lost my oldest son when I was 21. that's correct and a few years ago my oldest brother is a couple years older than I am had cancer and it was terminal and about a month before he passed away I had a dream and I saw him with my son and he was 20 years old and they were just horse playing converting around in my tree and I watched him and I called my son and said Kevin Kevin he said Is it true is it his time is going to pass right and whenever Kevin would talk to somebody seriously about something I put both his hands on his shoulder yeah so that's what he did in my dream and he said yes so when I woke up I called my job and I said I need a month's leave because my brother's got it and three weeks later he passed right so far what I wanted to say is that I saw both of them as 20 year olds sure and brothers Sam's been preaching that your soul is the real you that's right so your soul and your spirit is the body absolutely different kind of body did this but good good point yeah picture that he had of you it's in you right now that's crazy that's right that's my next Point your body's gonna match what that Genesis 126 person in see I'm telling you you listen to Holy Ghost Phil woman sometimes she's better than most preachers and I say that to all you that are listening that was well said sister absolutely but read what the prophet says you're being molded into the image that you are are because God's never present he saw you before the foundation of the world he's not going to see any different now that's right and like sister uh Barbara said now Ask Gary Atkins now his wife died and Margaret was in her 30s and that am I okay with she was in her 30s close to it she had to be 30. 17 years sorry it was 17 years ago about 17 years ago she was right at 40. she was right at 40. yes all right now Gary had a question about did she make it or not remember and she don't mind me telling so Gary has a dream he said God I need I want to know and she's okay did she make it because Margaret was just a real quiet unassuming just really making my own you know and all that and Gary wanted to know well he had a dream and as far as I know let me get part of it right she was like on a balcony she was climbing up a ladder and he looks over the ladder and he sees her well now he knew her at 20 years old he said that's what he saw he didn't see the 40 year old that went in the ground right he saw that 20 year old girl that he knew when they were young so see God's if God shows you something he can't make it different uh you know you say well I had a dream and I saw my grandpa and he would he looked like my grandpa well okie dokie then ain't saying no more about that but God's got to be scriptural if you want to know about something and he gives you desire of your heart and if you have a dream about somebody that's passed on they got to be in that 20 year old body they got to be in that form of the image that God saw him because that's where they're at remember brother Brown went in the sixth Dimension he all in his hair when I wait a minute he'll have his hair laying on the bed you see how this is something and it may play with some of you new people's mind but some of you older people we all start realizing that God's preserved this thing that's right and he's preserved you that's what I said about the pickling process the other day you went through the Cucumber but once you got pickled you can't go back to be a cucumber but you look just like a cucumber right and do you know actually pickling the word baptized and baptismal comes from the word pickle pickle I mean how oh gee it comes from the word what were we talking about the other day anyway it's the pickling process so that's what you go through when you're baptized and not just in the name of Jesus Christ but when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost God pickles you that's right he turns you you still look like a cucumber but you being pickled and you can't go back to a cucumber but you look still look like a cucumber good point y'all y'all want to do this all right the Lord's blessing us this morning or something so so just uh that we've been tough we've been taught that's correct we've been taught by the best teacher in the message I believe no doubt about it in my mind so so and the Bible's been put together and the prophet's message has been put together there's really um you know a lot of people have questions about certain things well one thing about brother Dale if he believes something you're going to know what he believes whether you believe it or not amen you're going to know what he believes so that's what I appreciate about um about him that um that we don't have to walk does he believe we're going to get does he believe it no he'll tell you what he believed and he spritzed it for 40 something years what he's preaching now like he said he's been preaching since 1969. which is a lot better than some people in the message I know but uh ain't got much more time but does everybody understand about the about the body and just remember one thing this was boring seeing such an iniquity this can't enter into the kingdom of heaven like it came from your mom and daddy because it's flesh it's flesh and blood it's human it's natural it's but it's okay to be that that's the way God wanted it to be because I believe God what's a human for eternity because if he was not a human and then he changed into a human God changed right so God can't change he always was a human being right he never was like you said he made man in his own image well sure I don't know why I didn't do that before but now remember listen to this though if you caught what I was trying to preach in that Genesis 1 26 man that Genesis 1 26 man was made in the image of God but now that 2-7 man is made in the image of animal right you understand that in Genesis 1 26 man was made in the image of God but now when he put it in the 2-7 man it just molded right in you understand which was Adam but that's animal flesh somebody had a question one time and I'll just try to explain it without being we don't have a lot of young people in here but the reason we have sex organs you say well God didn't want us to be born by save we weren't the 126 man is born by the spoken word of God right but God created Hollywood frog cow donkey horse mammal lizards whatever and we're the highest form of creation brother Branham says this is animal flesh do you know what he said that's right so that's why we were created with the organs that we have because we came into this world as in Creative Evolution they may understand that right we come in Creative Evolution then when God put that 126 man into the 2-7 man there was a molded image of God called Adam there wasn't nobody else I mean he had the rest of us that's why Adam was given the ability to reproduce me and you not sexually brother Brown's preached the spoken word is the original seat right right the spoken word is the way we were to come Adam wants to speak right we were supposed to be humans we were supposed to live on the Earth right we were supposed to rule and Reign on the earth we were supposed to subdue it we were supposed to multiply we were supposed to replenish we don't been through all this haven't we not yes right right but what Satan said is okay I can't get into the soul of man but I can pervert him so much until then I can interject myself in by Nature so he takes a beast that has a organ got it yes because remember Satan's not a man that's right here sayings of spirit he's not a man he doesn't have seed he can't reproduce himself that's why Satan is a bluff he can't even reproduce yourself he perverts what God already made so he takes Eve through the Beast and perverts what God wants to be spoken I'm sure the Beast walks up to even says Eve you're supposed to reproduce God told you that because remember Satan's standing there in Genesis 1 26. you believe it or not he was standing there because he was God's right-hand man remember he created angels and Satan and any angels and then come down let us make man in our own image all right so Satan's standing there and Satan's like multiply the dogs and the cats are multiplying the horses and the pigs are multiplying all these people are multiplying even the Beast was multiplying sexually because there's nothing wrong with them that's right right they don't have to cover themselves up and the cows do their business out in the field you know you understand there's no we don't go up they need to go in the bedroom no they don't do that that's nature that's natural I mean do we really it's like Trudy said if you if you live on a farm you want to know about conversion to me yeah real quick but remember that you say well how do you know they were they were reproducing because if God killed a lamb that's right did he not Bible says in Genesis God killed the lamb pulled the skins off threw him to Adam and Eve so it must have been two of them and if it would have just been two left over they'd have been no more Lambs so they were reproducing sexually right okay nature they were reproducing sexually so all satan had to do was it says hey I can get into that be stress there and I can talk to Eve see Satan's a great scientist he understands the principles of life that's what the prophet said he understands the what was the principles of life this goes in this and creates this that's the principles of life right so he says hey I'm getting that Beast because that Beast doesn't have a soul I can I can in other words I can manipulate that creature because he can either coincide with the man with the the Beast or the animal kingdom or he can coincide with the human they're so close so Satan walks up to him and says hey you see those animals out there they're reproducing and inside the Beast the Beast can say look I'm reproducing what's your problem I only see you and Adam God told you to multiply I heard him yeah and leave gets in her mind remember brother Brown said she tried to help God you know what he said she tried to help god well what was she doing she was trying to fulfill that Genesis 1 26 that's right but she was trying to do it carnally not by the word of God brother Brown said she got out from behind the word right because a word would have told her multiply and replenish like we are now by the spoken word of God by the children of God being born by the Breath of God not through the loins of man all right so they may understand we kind of had a little education class this morning but yeah is that all right I mean that kind of tells us where we're at and and the things that we've done and you know you look in the Garden of Eden and you know there's one thing for sure it wasn't an apple bag it was that hello world all right I mean if if Darwin would have just looked in the Bible he'd have found the missing link the one that stood between monkey and my ankles genetically somebody had to know that something was in there that could coincide either way right that's why everybody gets all weirded out in the world when you say it wasn't an apple it was a a beast well the Bible calls it a beast he was turned into a serpent so that he couldn't produce like that anymore actually God just took that whole line and destroyed it off the face of the Earth I was looking at stuff because I like to research things and uh found out one day that all snakes in the world go back to that Wednesday but when you look at the skeleton of Ebola you can see appendages where it used to have arms and legs and no other snakes amazing wow yeah it's pretty amazing so you see there that when that when that man asked brother Brown said well where's the Beast today he said God help me what's in that serpent he just changed it so much to where man doesn't see any shoulders or anything like that so man goes it's an apple now if you've eaten an apple and had to cover her private parts up why don't we when we eat out yeah when we eat apples like brother Ernie villanue said why didn't God give them a glove and something to go over their mouth but it wasn't that because remember the first thing Adam said was we're naked and God said who told you that right because remember they walked around naked the whole time and it didn't bother him but what my point is too is when we start when we go back to the image of God it's not sex anymore it's going back to the spoken word of God just like I explained the other day daddy started with 15 people in 1971. now we got almost 100 or a little more than 100 that go here that is spiritual multiplication that is the Fulfillment of Genesis 1 26 to multiply and replenish the Earth see you know what God just took Satan's plan I said okay buddy you may have stopped the Son of God from being born in the garden but I'm going to bring him down into your reading and I'm gonna raise them all up and then we're gonna destroy your kingdom right in the same thing that would destroy us if we'd let it this because this will destroy you if you let it right go down we have a couple of questions on the water pipe body when we look at Jesus when he was come back and was talking to the disciples he ate food that's correct and he also said this flesh and Bone he didn't mention blood right he mentioned flesh and Bone crap didn't Jesus have blood that's going to be dead yes I think we're maybe he was trying to tell them that the structure of man which is bone and flesh because blood's not a structure you understand the reason he was eating that and he didn't hit the floor there was some structure there that was holding it together you understand what I'm saying because remember brother went across a certain time right brother Rand went across the curtain of time into that sixth Dimension and they didn't eat and drink over there why they were not in their right condition you said boy that's pretty right yeah it is but you know what God wants them back here this is where we have dominion he wants us back here in our flesh bodies all them people in the sixth Dimension said we don't eat or drink here right right we're waiting to come back there because remember when the Rapture takes place they're going to be standing right here are you saying we'll eat throughout eternity oh absolutely no doubt we will absolutely not to recreate not to not to recreate sales or anything we're going to do it because we want to Hallelujah and there's not going to be Weight Watchers and no cats somebody ought to sing a song there's no calories in glory we're coming back here to eat and drink and enjoy ourselves just like we enjoy ourselves now with all the sin gone amen Garden questions I might go away hey Trudy the first one would have been Jesus yeah
