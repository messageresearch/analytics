[45:53] this morning that we running to obtain
[45:55] the great price Paul said I've run the
[45:57] race I've kept the pace amen and there
[46:00] is a crow of righteous laid up before me
[46:02] I'd like to talk about when we start out
[46:04] this race we know that we come when we
[46:06] was born into this world we was born in
[46:09] sin shaping in iniquity we come into
[46:12] this world speaking lives but I'm
[46:14] thankful this morning that there's a
[46:15] there's a greater way I'd like to call
[46:17] that this first light this first birth
[46:20] that we come to is a sack that we all
[46:23] was given a saw we was given this sack
[46:26] to car to running this race and you know
[46:29] in this sa we didn't ask for the things
[46:31] that was put in it we put in the things
[46:33] when we was born in this life you know
[46:35] and the first thing we had was we we was
[46:37] born a liar we was born a thief we stole
[46:42] we we had those Natures in us because
[46:44] even it's small children we see that
[46:46] when they're little that you don't have
[46:48] to tell them how to lie they already
[46:50] know it right because we didn't ask for
[46:52] this s we should have come a Divine way
[46:55] we could should have come through the
[46:56] spoke word of God so we didn't ask for
[46:59] this sack to start off with this morning
[47:01] I want us to look into our sack this
[47:03] morning and see what's holding us back
[47:05] that we may run this
[47:06] race run this race and that we will be
[47:10] able to stay in keep our keep the pace
[47:13] this morning we want to look and see the
[47:15] things we started out with in this
[47:17] life a lot of times we start out in the
[47:20] Life maybe as we come to maybe as
[47:23] maturity as a you know from a small
[47:25] child we go into school and we add we
[47:28] had rocks into our sack you know that
[47:30] makes us wait us down things that we've
[47:32] had in our lives that happened to us and
[47:35] Satan has added these rocks you know a
[47:37] lot of times you know we we come we went
[47:39] to school and we want to be the smartest
[47:40] kid in school you know and it just
[47:42] wasn't meant to be for that a lot of
[47:44] times maybe some of us did you know some
[47:46] of us accomplish those things but you
[47:47] know a lot of times maybe the the people
[47:50] made fun of us or they or they done
[47:52] something to us and know and that added
[47:53] a rock in our sack that we didn't need
[47:55] you know l times it took God's grace for
[47:58] us to overcome those things you know
[48:00] when I was a young kid in school you
[48:02] know they like to make fun of because I
[48:03] was born with a club foot they said I'd
[48:05] never walk but God created ankle bone so
[48:07] I'm standing here by the grace of God
[48:09] even though I just come out of surgery
[48:11] about 8 weeks ago but I'm doing very
[48:13] well by God's grace but God has given us
[48:16] the ability this morning but we look at
[48:18] that you know and a lot of times you
[48:19] wanted to be the you want to be the
[48:21] first one picked you want to be the
[48:23] first one when they had a team or
[48:25] whatever the thing was you want to be
[48:26] the first first one picking you a lot of
[48:28] times you was the last one picked you
[48:31] know Satan had that to he was trying to
[48:32] build a complex in your life he was
[48:36] trying to add something to your sack to
[48:38] make those that weight so heavy and so
[48:41] heavy and weighted down that when you
[48:42] run this race brother said when we have
[48:44] all these weights that's so easy to
[48:46] beset us in this bag you know it's
[48:48] trying like trying to run a race with a
[48:50] backpack full of rocks oh yeah we're not
[48:53] going so good sometimes we feel like
[48:54] we're just running and getting quick
[48:55] sand yeah but a lot of times I'm here to
[48:57] tell you this morning that God wants to
[48:59] empty your sack this morning God wants
[49:01] to take out all those things that we've
[49:03] carried around for years in years and
[49:05] years you know a lot of times we come up
[49:08] in school you know then we get into
[49:09] church you know a lot of people have
[49:11] become Church hurt oh yeah you know we
[49:13] went to certain churches and certain
[49:15] preachers hurt us you know what we come
[49:17] to church for deliverance but you know
[49:20] what a lot of lot of times we come to
[49:22] church and the minister has not come to
[49:23] the place of few maturity I'm not
[49:25] talking about here but you we set under
[49:27] a certain headship and you wanted to
[49:28] leave the church let set free but you're
[49:32] left with a heavier weight than you did
[49:33] when you come in but this morning we're
[49:35] not going to leave with those rocks in
[49:37] the back you know what you come to such
[49:39] a place to where you couldn't trust
[49:41] ministers anymore and Satan said well
[49:43] I've added another rock to them you know
[49:45] I've added that rock of complex being
[49:47] last and I've added them another one
[49:50] where they don't trust nobody you know
[49:52] we come through this life and we realize
[49:54] that God has given us the ability to
[49:56] unload that sack this
[49:58] morning because he wants to put rocks in
[50:02] our sack of Revelation peace Joy
[50:06] longsuffering all the great things there
[50:08] are our benefits there are the things
[50:10] that God has given us and we need to put
[50:12] those in our CL those rocks are so
[50:14] they're light amen he said come unto me
[50:17] all you that he weary and heavy laden
[50:19] and I will give you
[50:21] rest you know a lot of times we try to
[50:24] start this race we try to start this
[50:26] race and we come into this race and we
[50:28] don't even start the outset of the race
[50:30] right you know a lot of times we hear
[50:33] that even out into the church world we
[50:35] heard it so many times you know they
[50:36] preach of prosperity I believe in
[50:38] prosperity I believe in spiritual
[50:40] Prosperity I believe in the natural
[50:42] Prosperity but I believe I believe what
[50:44] the Jesus said in Matthew chapter 6
[50:47] verse 33 he said but seek ye
[50:49] first the kingdom of God and all his
[50:53] righteousness and all things shall be
[50:56] added unto you right amen you know a lot
[50:57] of people that come out there say well
[50:58] Lord I want you to save me but I got
[51:00] some things I want you to give me I want
[51:03] you to let me have these things but you
[51:04] know what if you can seek you first the
[51:08] kingdom of God Amen and all his
[51:10] righteousness everything else will be
[51:11] added unto you so a lot of times we
[51:14] begin to worry and we begin to threat
[51:16] over things maybe financial troubles but
[51:19] let me tell you Satan has added that
[51:21] rock in Us in this age that we're
[51:23] worried about things but the Bible has a
[51:25] commission a covenant he said if you'll
[51:27] seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
[51:30] his right then he'll add everything else
[51:32] to you right he not provide all our
[51:35] needs I don't look like any of us has
[51:36] been
[51:38] starving no I don't look like any of us
[51:40] has been poor we we're not living in
[51:44] shacks and all those things you know we
[51:46] might not have everything we want but I
[51:48] tell you what when we've got God we've
[51:49] got everything a lot of times we might
[51:51] not understand I've had in my whole life
[51:53] had not understand how you might pay the
[51:55] light bill yeah how you might not be
[51:57] able to pay your house payment but let
[51:59] me tell you what we serve an all time
[52:02] God I've seen you meet my needs every
[52:05] time every place everywhere under every
[52:09] condition
[52:11] amen GL he's not a god of
[52:15] poverty no but you know what when they
[52:18] teach those things they get you to
[52:19] looking the wrong way and you know you
[52:21] like to use that prayer of jbz yeah that
[52:24] increase my borders and grab all these
[52:26] things but they fa to use that part
[52:28] where J has prayed and said Lord if it's
[52:31] a hindrance to me if it's an added Rock
[52:34] in my sack that I don't want I don't
[52:37] thank God for unanswered prayers a lot
[52:40] of times we pray for things that God
[52:42] given to us and he won't give it to us
[52:44] because we don't have need of it it
[52:46] would be an added burden or an added
[52:48] weight to our
[52:50] back we see that a lot of times if we
[52:53] don't talk the Christian race the right
[52:55] way
[52:57] then we're already
[53:00] disqualified or we have to come God's
[53:02] provided way right right you know what a
[53:05] lot of people have depended have Satan
[53:07] has deceived a lot of people because
[53:10] they think it's just been a change of
[53:12] mind oh my come on a change of thinking
[53:15] or turn over a new Leaf oh my come on or
[53:17] made a better decision in life come on
[53:20] but let me tell you here this morning
[53:22] just a better decision or a change of
[53:24] mind won't take you out of here
[53:27] right it must be a heart changing this
[53:31] thing that happens in your life must be
[53:32] a born again experience with God I'm so
[53:35] glad that God took that nature away a
[53:37] lot of times we started out this race
[53:39] when we was in sin we had
[53:42] pits bad habits oh yeah you know I want
[53:45] before the Lord got a hold of me I
[53:47] smoked cigarettes I drank I done all
[53:49] those things I shouldn't do but you know
[53:50] what I'm glad that God emptied my sack
[53:53] you know and people said how did you
[53:54] quit smoking you know what brother
[53:57] brother Dale what I didn't what I didn't
[53:59] I come to understand is that I didn't
[54:01] quit he took it from
[54:04] me heed that
[54:07] sight and you know when he he begin to
[54:09] take those things away from me you know
[54:11] and they say you know they think well
[54:13] you know you just turned over you did it
[54:14] by self-will and I begin to ask God one
[54:17] day I said Lord how come I always tried
[54:20] to do those things within myself how
[54:23] come I tried to do them and I couldn't
[54:25] never accomplish he said because if it
[54:27] was by your own power then by your own
[54:30] power you could go back and get it he
[54:33] said because I took it I took the want
[54:35] to away so you don't have that desire
[54:37] anymore I bur every bridge I throw out
[54:41] every Rock I'm so thankful that the Holy
[54:44] Spirit has that ability to take those
[54:46] things
[54:47] away you know what a lot of people base
[54:50] their confession as a Christian on the
[54:53] five
[54:54] sentences you know I felt something
[54:57] and I believe you do right I'm not
[54:59] against feeling I'm not against emotion
[55:01] and I tell you what that's all we got
[55:02] was emotion then one day we're going to
[55:05] begin to cry and weep because look at
[55:08] let's look at Esau even through all his
[55:11] emotions and all his desires he weeped
[55:13] and he cried and he still couldn't
[55:15] receive what he hadn't because he had
[55:17] already sold out his birth right back
[55:20] that rock that he needed and he was
[55:22] Glory he had it he he had the right that
[55:26] right but he sold it out for for a you
[55:29] look at many others have done it we look
[55:31] at we have to be careful as ministers
[55:33] the prophet said it's money women are
[55:34] proper land but you know what we preach
[55:37] on money and women a lot but what about
[55:40] proper land you know a lot of preachers
[55:42] like to car up they going to rock in
[55:44] their sack they look out I have preached
[55:46] for this brother and I have preached for
[55:47] that brother and I've been here and I've
[55:49] been in this message so long but that's
[55:52] good and that's fine but if it's just
[55:53] that rock that you got if you're not
[55:55] built upon the rock of Jesus Christ it's
[55:58] not what we've done or what we could do
[56:01] it's what God's already
[56:03] done all we're doing is walking in the
[56:06] vision right we're walking in the light
[56:09] this morning yeah you know what the the
[56:12] main sense then the only sense that
[56:15] makes any sense is the sick
[56:17] sense you know what because he says this
[56:19] what the word says He agrees with what
[56:22] the truth is the other sense is you
[56:25] can't make no sense out of
[56:27] them you know when I was out in the
[56:29] world you know I was in the racing so
[56:30] much brother D that I if I depended on
[56:33] my senses i' have thought I had
[56:35] something special from God oh yeah a lot
[56:37] of them doing they saying they have
[56:38] something just because they cry I would
[56:40] have never thought that a man would cry
[56:42] over the death of a race car driver yeah
[56:45] but you know what when dve Allison got
[56:47] killed I cried yeah I felt something but
[56:51] it wasn't God right it was an emotion it
[56:55] was a stimulation from one of those
[56:57] other S one these senses but it wasn't a
[56:59] divine revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[57:02] but when Christ came in my heart Glory
[57:05] let me tell you when he come he changed
[57:08] everything I'm glad when he put that
[57:10] Holy Ghost in there and he fed my heart
[57:12] with the Holy Spirit you know what when
[57:14] you say well I'm afraid to let you know
[57:16] lot of people say well I'm afraid to let
[57:17] brother so and so go here brother so and
[57:19] so or go to this church or that church
[57:20] and we should stay at our post to you
[57:21] but sometimes when we're on vacation or
[57:23] something we were to go to church you
[57:26] know but like you go down there that guy
[57:30] teach you something you know it might
[57:32] might capture my people a lot of people
[57:33] think he good to cist at their crowd but
[57:36] hey if they if anybody can take your
[57:37] people they wasn't yours in the first
[57:41] place I mean cuz if you take their
[57:43] people then somebody take yours I mean
[57:46] it's that way we got so many people
[57:47] tossed about we need to have stability
[57:51] we need to have the assurance that God
[57:53] is able to keep us I'm glad that God s a
[57:56] in a certain town right to lead us and
[57:59] guide
[58:00] us but when we lean on these other
[58:03] senses these other rocks they love to to
[58:06] us any that's why we got so many people
[58:08] all these strange doctrines yeah return
[58:10] Ministries oh Two Souls five Souls you
[58:13] might as well have five you go let's go
[58:15] with a good
[58:17] number let's go with a good number we
[58:20] don't have all them we don't have all
[58:21] them rocks at least give me five rocks
[58:23] David had five rocks in his smooth rocks
[58:25] in his back
[58:27] but we have to be careful of right you
[58:29] know what those people are sincere right
[58:32] but they're sincerely wrong so the
[58:34] Hindus they're sincere but they're
[58:36] sincerely L we shouldn't walk by and
[58:38] think we're better than them but we
[58:39] ought to pray for them exactly you know
[58:42] what he said he'll know that you're my
[58:43] disciples that you pray ye one for
[58:46] another that's the way you get healing
[58:48] right to pray one for another Glory that
[58:51] ye might be healed I'm so thankful for
[58:54] that that God gives us that we depend
[58:57] upon what we have felt and what we expen
[59:00] and what we experienced in our feelings
[59:01] a lot of times instead of uh on what the
[59:05] real divine revelation of Grace is you
[59:07] know Jesus has got rocks he wants to put
[59:09] in our bag too rocks of Revelation Glory
[59:13] I believe there's a stimulation with
[59:14] this exactly I believe I believe the
[59:17] stimulation of the word of God causes
[59:19] something to happen in your body in your
[59:21] soul in your spirit right you know a lot
[59:24] of times we accept the Rock of a new
[59:27] spirit yeah and we think that's just
[59:30] good enough but brother said let's don't
[59:32] stop at a new spirit that was the nature
[59:34] that that you was able to be able to
[59:37] worship and to be able to talk with God
[59:39] come on but a lot of people say I got
[59:41] the Holy Ghost but they've only had
[59:42] they've only had a new spirit come on
[59:45] because they still have those things in
[59:46] their heart they still have those
[59:48] desires the Holy Ghost don't have no
[59:50] desire to lie the Holy Ghost don't have
[59:52] no desire to cheat the Holy Ghost don't
[59:54] have no desire to steal
[59:56] right only the Devil by that wrong
[59:59] nature that wrong sack of rocks we
[1:00:02] started out with I like what Deuteronomy
[1:00:05] says in 2513 he says Thou shalt not have
[1:00:09] in thy bag divers
[1:00:12] weights of Great and
[1:00:15] Small that's what about that's that's
[1:00:18] diversity of things in our lives that's
[1:00:20] why the prophet that's why the prophet
[1:00:22] here Paul said let us lay aside every
[1:00:25] weight is so easily Bes set us and let
[1:00:27] us run this race I like what Proverbs
[1:00:29] said too in Proverbs 1611 says a just
[1:00:31] weight and a balance of the Lord's all
[1:00:35] of the weights of the bag are his work
[1:00:39] right all the weights in that nature
[1:00:42] that he has given us you know why we got
[1:00:44] so much confusion around the message
[1:00:46] because we haven't had a blood
[1:00:48] transfusion the DNA the blood of God
[1:00:52] when you got confusion that means you
[1:00:54] don't you haven't had a trans conf usion
[1:00:56] you haven't had a you Haden had a born
[1:00:58] again experience with God that's right
[1:01:01] God is not the author of confusion right
[1:01:04] Glory he has
[1:01:07] never come to confuse right but he's
[1:01:10] come to give wisdom and knowledge and
[1:01:14] understanding I like what Hebrews 12:1
[1:01:16] says is wherefore seeing we are also our
[1:01:19] compassed about with so great a cloud
[1:01:21] and witness he said let us lay
[1:01:24] aside every weight and sin which that so
[1:01:29] easily beset us and let us run this race
[1:01:32] with patience the race that is set
[1:01:35] before us you know what a lot of times
[1:01:37] we get impatient because our bag is so
[1:01:39] heavy and we're not moving as fast as we
[1:01:42] think we should but I'm here to tell you
[1:01:44] this morning he said come unto me all ye
[1:01:47] that are weary and heavy laden and I
[1:01:49] will give you
[1:01:51] rest we have to reach forward with
[1:01:55] persistence
[1:01:56] right you know brother my brothers and
[1:01:58] sisters this morning the kingdom of God
[1:01:59] is pressed into right it's not just it's
[1:02:02] just not something that we can that we
[1:02:05] we have to wrestle we have to press
[1:02:08] oursel even when we begin to pray we
[1:02:10] understand that when we begin to pray a
[1:02:11] lot of times it seems like our prayers
[1:02:12] go no higher than this ceiling but you
[1:02:14] know what that don't stop us right we're
[1:02:16] going we got to press into this Kingdom
[1:02:18] we just keep on praying and say God I
[1:02:20] know because your word said over in
[1:02:23] Peter your ears are always open
[1:02:26] to the cries of your children and your
[1:02:28] eyes are upon the righteous and your
[1:02:31] face is against the wicked one I'm glad
[1:02:33] we have that promise this morning right
[1:02:36] I like what Paul said to us in
[1:02:38] Philippians 3:13 he says Brethren I
[1:02:41] count on myself to apprehended but this
[1:02:45] one thing I do forgetting those things
[1:02:49] which are behind and reaching forth unto
[1:02:52] those things which are before he said
[1:02:55] verse 14 he said I press toward the mark
[1:02:58] of the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:03:00] in Christ
[1:03:01] Jesus you know what a lot of times we
[1:03:04] can't forget the things that we've had
[1:03:06] in our past amen a lot of times Satan
[1:03:09] brings those things up our past failures
[1:03:13] our past mistakes and a lot of times we
[1:03:15] carried those things down and we live a
[1:03:17] defeated life brother said we live so
[1:03:18] far below our privileges exactly you
[1:03:21] know why cuz we're so weighted down with
[1:03:23] the things we our
[1:03:24] mistakes our heartaches our troubles but
[1:03:27] you know what we can say that like Paul
[1:03:29] said he said brother and I count on
[1:03:31] myself apprehended because he was
[1:03:33] wanting the new body yeah a lot of
[1:03:35] people have the rock that we're in the
[1:03:37] Millennium but let me tell you I'm
[1:03:39] disappointed he said I was going to have
[1:03:41] a new body not this man amen not a man
[1:03:45] with a club foot not a man that gets
[1:03:47] sick not a man that feels sorrow and
[1:03:50] Agony and defeat right but a man that is
[1:03:53] Victorious right and newbody in Christ
[1:03:56] Jesus right he said I do forgetting
[1:03:59] those things which are behind and
[1:04:02] reaching forth unto the things which are
[1:04:04] before he said I press toward the mark
[1:04:07] of the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:04:09] in Christ Jesus so we see
[1:04:12] here I imagine when the Lord come to
[1:04:16] Paul that day and spoke to him when he
[1:04:18] was riding down to persecute the very
[1:04:22] Church of the Living
[1:04:24] God he had done stood there and held the
[1:04:26] coat as they Stone Steven yeah and when
[1:04:30] God spoke to him and said Saul Saul why
[1:04:34] persecuted thou
[1:04:36] me he said Saul it's hard for you to
[1:04:41] kick against the PRS a lot of times God
[1:04:43] is trying to get us to move forward he
[1:04:45] was wanting to press toward the mark of
[1:04:47] the high calling in Christ Jesus but I
[1:04:50] can imagine through Paul's life at the
[1:04:52] things he had done to the church I
[1:04:54] believe there was a lot of way in his
[1:04:56] life oh yeah in his sa that he he had he
[1:04:59] he had took and he had carried through
[1:05:01] his life I imagine a lot of times when
[1:05:03] he said when he said there is a minister
[1:05:05] of Satan that has come to Buffet me oh
[1:05:07] yeah I imagine that minister of Satan
[1:05:09] come to talk to him said now Paul we
[1:05:12] realize and I know God has spoke to you
[1:05:15] see Satan will never deny that God is
[1:05:17] God oh yeah but he said but Paul look at
[1:05:21] here how can you through your emotions
[1:05:23] or maybe so he said you're just probably
[1:05:24] worked up Paul because you think God
[1:05:27] would have allowed you yeah to have let
[1:05:30] those people Stone Sten yeah and I
[1:05:32] imagine that was a heavy weight to be on
[1:05:34] Paul's mind can you imagine that right
[1:05:37] how many people would have voted him in
[1:05:39] to be the pastor of the
[1:05:40] church right look at the resume of Paul
[1:05:44] right you know a lot of people we think
[1:05:45] we had to have a resume to be a preacher
[1:05:47] no we have to have the Holy Ghost right
[1:05:49] we're going to have a gift but I'm
[1:05:52] looking at Paul and that begin I I I
[1:05:55] believe that kind of weighed him down in
[1:05:56] his life a lot of times you know because
[1:05:59] when you go through you know brother
[1:06:00] Dale when you preach on Sunday morning
[1:06:02] or and Sunday afternoon when you preach
[1:06:03] and then that next day see Satan's there
[1:06:06] oh yeah he says I remember when he was
[1:06:08] under the anointing yeah but now I want
[1:06:11] to see you live that life right you
[1:06:13] talked a good talk but I'm glad there's
[1:06:15] something on the inside that can help us
[1:06:16] that can make help us accomplish that
[1:06:18] life for it's more than just preaching a
[1:06:21] sermon brother said leave me a sermon
[1:06:24] you know for your action speak loud than
[1:06:25] your words you know a lot of people have
[1:06:28] the ability to preach but they don't
[1:06:30] have the ability to live the life right
[1:06:32] you know if you hadn't been born again
[1:06:33] you'll never be able to live the
[1:06:35] life so I begin I imagine when Paul said
[1:06:38] I went to the up into the third heaven
[1:06:41] and he called all those Revelations you
[1:06:42] know Paul could have had a big old rock
[1:06:44] of he could have got a big head oh yeah
[1:06:47] I mean because God showed him things he
[1:06:49] said I can't even
[1:06:50] speak you know and he begin to break for
[1:06:54] the word and he begin to give him the
[1:06:55] revelation of Jesus Christ God in flesh
[1:06:59] yeah and he begin to work on him he
[1:07:01] begin to show him those things he begin
[1:07:03] to open up all those Revelations to him
[1:07:05] all those things that just shall live by
[1:07:07] faith all those great things that he had
[1:07:09] all those wonderful sermons he preached
[1:07:12] and I I believe Satan said now look at
[1:07:13] here Paul we know that you have you have
[1:07:15] a lot of head knowledge but really has
[1:07:18] it been Revelation To You Paul come on
[1:07:21] you know a lot of us around the message
[1:07:22] we got a lot of head knowledge but has
[1:07:24] it become a revelation to us has it
[1:07:27] become a divine revelation from God L
[1:07:30] have we just been taught a lot of things
[1:07:31] I think we've been taught we've been
[1:07:33] taught a lot and we shouldn't have a lot
[1:07:36] of things but Paul said he had taught
[1:07:37] those Corinthians a lot of things too
[1:07:40] when he said I come to you that I might
[1:07:41] give you meat oh yeah but I found out
[1:07:44] just still on milk right you know
[1:07:46] because they still had weights in their
[1:07:47] life they had fussing they had back
[1:07:49] biting they had arguments they had
[1:07:51] troubles in the
[1:07:52] church we should be going beyond all
[1:07:55] those things we should press toward the
[1:07:58] mark of the high calling if there's a
[1:08:00] brother having trouble in church you
[1:08:01] shouldn't go tell everybody about it
[1:08:03] exactly you should pray for that brother
[1:08:05] or that sister amen but a lot of times
[1:08:07] we get in trouble we pick up that old
[1:08:09] rock of foam and we begin to talk to one
[1:08:13] another say well you know brother sww
[1:08:15] he's a good brother but but that rock
[1:08:18] but is a big old rock and you know what
[1:08:21] we a lot of times we make we we get in a
[1:08:24] lot of trouble with that Rock right you
[1:08:26] know we come into the house of God and
[1:08:28] we should have good things in our sack
[1:08:30] but a lot of times we'll take our the
[1:08:32] things that God has shed us and we use
[1:08:34] it on one
[1:08:35] another that's why we've not come to
[1:08:37] full maturity yet that's why we've not
[1:08:39] come to the full place of adoption amen
[1:08:42] is because we have we've still got those
[1:08:44] rocks in there and you know when it's
[1:08:46] just just because you might know a
[1:08:47] little bit more than another brother or
[1:08:49] sister doesn't like you any greater than
[1:08:50] them right cuz look at you would have
[1:08:53] never thought Luther would just a little
[1:08:55] simple Revelation he had could have
[1:08:58] turned the Catholic Church upside down
[1:09:00] he didn't have what we have He Still
[1:09:02] Smoked a pipe he still drunk beer I'm
[1:09:05] not condoning those things but you know
[1:09:08] he had to come to maturity
[1:09:09] too and you know what they without us
[1:09:12] cannot be made perfect right so we need
[1:09:14] to go strive on into Perfection right
[1:09:17] coming into perfection in God's word the
[1:09:20] only thing we have had received the
[1:09:22] perfect word to take a perfect WRA
[1:09:26] there is rapturing faith in this
[1:09:29] message so we must lay away all those
[1:09:31] rocks when we take those rocks a lot
[1:09:33] times we see a lot of times that
[1:09:35] somebody might know a little more a
[1:09:37] preacher thinks he's a little better
[1:09:38] than another preacher or maybe more
[1:09:40] mature but he is if he is that's great
[1:09:43] yeah but don't be little your brother or
[1:09:45] your sister because he's not come to
[1:09:46] that place yet but strengthening Paul
[1:09:49] said I become all things to all men that
[1:09:53] I might win some to Christ
[1:09:55] I was talking to brother Tim's Dad one
[1:09:58] time when he was able to talk and he
[1:09:59] said you know what made brother rown
[1:10:00] such a great man he was able to come
[1:10:02] down to their level whether it was a man
[1:10:04] with a PhD or it was just an old farmer
[1:10:07] you know what how can you how do you if
[1:10:09] you come to a farmer and you start
[1:10:10] talking all these things you load his
[1:10:12] mind right this message is an atomic
[1:10:16] bomb we must win them through love right
[1:10:20] but you know what that's the rock that
[1:10:21] we need more of and it's probably the
[1:10:23] smallest rock yeah in our bag until we
[1:10:27] come into perfect love we're not going
[1:10:28] to get out of here right I like how the
[1:10:31] brother brand worked on the Infidel by
[1:10:33] the little apple tree he didn't come to
[1:10:36] him and say look right here in
[1:10:37] Revelations look over here Romans
[1:10:40] 8 he said well L you know my mother
[1:10:42] always taught me to give a cow enough
[1:10:44] run you'll hang there it's the
[1:10:47] Simplicity of the Gospel it's the simple
[1:10:50] things you know we sometimes I think we
[1:10:52] we make it so hard that the people can't
[1:10:54] apprehend it yeah
[1:10:55] you ever had somebody say some things
[1:10:57] and you're like I like what brother Cal
[1:10:59] said he said some of them guys come in
[1:11:00] they preach so deep said my my church
[1:11:02] they has to have a dictionary to keep up
[1:11:04] with the great big words they
[1:11:06] speak that don't show God God was simple
[1:11:09] he come in the simple way he the the
[1:11:12] what was the great about Jesus Christ is
[1:11:14] that he was able to take them he never
[1:11:16] went down to their level but at their
[1:11:18] level he was able to bring them up to
[1:11:19] his
[1:11:21] level there is the key to witnessing
[1:11:24] gory and to being able to win people in
[1:11:26] Christ just live a life you don't have
[1:11:29] to preach to him this guy working told
[1:11:31] me said man I like you he said a lot of
[1:11:33] preach a lot of lot of uh Christians
[1:11:35] they they want to preach to you cuz
[1:11:37] you're a sinner he said but you don't
[1:11:38] ever say anything I said well brother I
[1:11:41] figure you know what condition you're in
[1:11:44] you don't have to tell me I don't have
[1:11:46] to tell you what you're doing wrong
[1:11:48] right I said because you got a
[1:11:50] conscience yeah but I said one thing
[1:11:52] about though if you ever get the Holy
[1:11:53] Spirit you wouldn't do the things
[1:11:55] anymore I said but I'm not here to make
[1:11:58] myself better you know that's what I
[1:11:59] liked about my pastor brother de when I
[1:12:01] first met him when the I wasn't I wasn't
[1:12:03] living right my mother said I want you
[1:12:04] to meet my pastor he's painting across
[1:12:06] the road there he's painting some
[1:12:07] apartments and went over there and
[1:12:10] there's another brother you know had
[1:12:11] long hair and you would never think that
[1:12:13] me now people say man that guy yeah
[1:12:15] ain't the same guy that's true I'm not
[1:12:17] right but that's only by his grace and I

[1:12:58] we had to we had to understand you know
[1:13:00] we're supposed to judge judgment begins
[1:13:02] at the house of God well we got to be
[1:13:04] careful with that rock who we throw
[1:13:06] at and he said judge not least you be
[1:13:08] judged
[1:13:09] yourself he said go and restore such a
[1:13:12] one amen and the faith least you fall
[1:13:14] into temptation yourself a lot of people
[1:13:17] that fell into temptation their s look
[1:13:20] at Jimmy swager when he begin to tell on
[1:13:22] the man the pressor instead of going to
[1:13:24] him and trying to keep it quiet and try
[1:13:26] to restore him back to Faith and if he
[1:13:28] wouldn't he could have exposed it but
[1:13:30] yet he blasted him and guess what the
[1:13:32] same thing happened to
[1:13:34] him we better be careful how we
[1:13:37] broadcast one another's faults somebody
[1:13:39] might me broadcasting mine and yours one
[1:13:41] of these days that old rock is awful big
[1:13:44] when it comes back your way it feel it's
[1:13:47] pretty light when you throw it at
[1:13:48] somebody else but when that thing hits
[1:13:49] you boy you know what that thing about
[1:13:52] so you better be careful how you throw
[1:13:53] that rock
[1:13:55] lot of times we just put that rock back
[1:13:57] in our sack say Lord you if they be any
[1:13:59] Rock

[1:14:04] ones when he come out there and they was
[1:14:05] going to Stone the woman and she was C
[1:14:07] into the very Act of
[1:14:09] adultery he said ye without sin I always
[1:14:12] think about that brother de you without

[1:14:26] I know I made a mistake I know I've done
[1:14:28] things brother said we sin daily that's
[1:14:31] and the Christian's the only one that
[1:14:32] sins she was a sinner man
[1:14:35] exactly see it would have been a sin for
[1:14:38] them to Stone her cuz where was the man
[1:14:41] that should have been both of them where
[1:14:43] was he he was caught to right they let
[1:14:46] him go they judged him all right yeah
[1:14:50] they Jed her wrong yeah they was both
[1:14:53] gifted right Sin Sin no matter what it
[1:14:55] is ain't no white sins no black sins
[1:14:57] ain't no big sin little sin sin is
[1:15:01] unbelief brother say smoke is not a sin
[1:15:04] cursing is not a sin he said unbelief
[1:15:07] that's the attributes of it that's the
[1:15:09] action that you got sin in your life if
[1:15:11] things like that you batt through things
[1:15:13] in your life that you want to talk about
[1:15:15] somebody and you want to do things and
[1:15:16] you want to always want to judge people
[1:15:18] that's the wrong Rock that's the wrong
[1:15:21] Rock to have in your sack this morning
[1:15:23] right Jesus come
[1:15:25] he said I come not to destroy the world
[1:15:28] but I came to save them I'm glad he
[1:15:31] didn't come with a back full of rock
[1:15:33] from judgment come on all he had to do
[1:15:35] was move one finger and he could
[1:15:37] destroyed and change the whole thing
[1:15:40] right but he was obedient oh yes to the
[1:15:43] death of the Cross even humbled himself
[1:15:46] to the death there right he went there
[1:15:48] he didn't complain and murmur like me
[1:15:50] and you do when we go through
[1:15:52] things what kept the women the the
[1:15:55] children of Israel in the wilderness for
[1:15:57] 40 years they're murmuring and
[1:16:00] complaining right we hear lot that well
[1:16:02] you know my pastor he's not that deep he
[1:16:04] don't go that deep in the word yeah be
[1:16:07] careful old cor right old Dayan you
[1:16:11] better be careful what you say about
[1:16:13] your pastor better be careful what stone
[1:16:15] you pull out you know what that's that's
[1:16:18] where we make mistakes you know what
[1:16:20] then we start to be
[1:16:21] judge uh ministers who's the deepest
[1:16:25] who's the greatest I can I can answer
[1:16:27] that very simple Jesus Christ right he's
[1:16:31] the deepest amen he's the simplest he
[1:16:34] became all things all you know he laid
[1:16:38] aside every weight you know what he had
[1:16:40] Desires in hisself said he could had a
[1:16:42] wife I know they got that out now with
[1:16:44] the through the D Vinci Cod that he had
[1:16:46] a wife Mary magdal all that's just
[1:16:49] worship of woman exactly we know that
[1:16:52] yes he could have he had the right to
[1:16:54] but he did
[1:16:55] he forsook all things are we willing to
[1:16:57] forsake all
[1:16:58] things that we might do the will of
[1:17:01] God do you realize that Jesus
[1:17:04] died in the garden of gend before he
[1:17:07] went on the cross he died to his own
[1:17:09] will he said nevertheless father not my
[1:17:12] will but thy will be done but you know
[1:17:14] what the greatest rock in our bag I
[1:17:15] believe a lot of time is self- will our
[1:17:18] desires our motives we got to check our
[1:17:21] motives and our objectives with the w we
[1:17:23] still have a year of thermal
[1:17:25] oh yeah we still have the prophet's
[1:17:28] quotebook the Bible right you know we
[1:17:31] still have the word of God but said
[1:17:34] anything in anything that the angel
[1:17:36] spoke to me that wasn't in this Bible I
[1:17:39] wouldn't believe it exactly it's just we
[1:17:41] didn't know where to look because it
[1:17:42] took a Divine interpreter of the word of
[1:17:44] prophet sure to come to us and show us
[1:17:47] these things to open the word of God to
[1:17:49] us well I'm thankful for that you know
[1:17:52] what and the greatest thing is we have a
[1:17:55] Rock of undis in our
[1:17:58] life undecided where don't we really
[1:18:01] have I do I have the holy ghost or don't
[1:18:04] have yes that's the greatest thing we
[1:18:06] battle a lot of times that in self will
[1:18:09] is look Satan says well you know if you
[1:18:11] really had you wouldn't have done this
[1:18:12] you wouldn't have done that but you know
[1:18:14] what it's what this it's it's your
[1:18:17] desire to serve God right it's not to by
[1:18:21] we're not rap rap by how many mistakes
[1:18:23] we've made in this life even Elijah said
[1:18:26] he was a man of like passion he had
[1:18:28] mistakes he made F he had faults he had
[1:18:31] failures but when he prayed right he
[1:18:34] knew who he was talking to Glory you
[1:18:36] know what he prayed for three and A2
[1:18:38] years it didn't rain right he believed
[1:18:41] in who he was praying to right it's not
[1:18:43] the we if we s we sin willfully I mean
[1:18:47] if we just do it because well that's our
[1:18:49] desire we're in trouble we haven't had a
[1:18:51] birth yet right that's the wrong Rock
[1:18:54] but once you get that rock once you get
[1:18:55] the Holy Spirit living inside that soul
[1:18:59] that old man is dead and you become a
[1:19:01] new creature in Christ
[1:19:03] Jesus all things have passed away all
[1:19:07] things you know what brother de I didn't
[1:19:09] know you know what I was raised around
[1:19:11] the message but you know what I never
[1:19:13] knew how precious the Bible was until I
[1:19:15] had a born again experience oh you know
[1:19:18] what even though we've been raised
[1:19:19] around the message and we s in message
[1:19:21] churches young people that's not good
[1:19:23] enough you know what I was depending
[1:19:25] upon Daddy and Mama's religion right oh
[1:19:29] and they had it they had the goodies I
[1:19:32] never got it well until God who's rich
[1:19:35] in Mercy gave me the same experience you
[1:19:37] know what I thought I'd be all right you
[1:19:39] know what the prophet God say God don't
[1:19:41] have no grandchildren right just because
[1:19:44] Mom and Daddy's got it that's not going
[1:19:46] to be good enough right they can be your
[1:19:48] Holy Ghost till you get to a certain age
[1:19:51] but then you're going to be accountable
[1:19:52] for yourself right you know what but I
[1:19:54] believe the the Holy Ghost is so rich to
[1:19:55] us brother that even While We're Young
[1:19:58] it said in John received the Holy Ghost
[1:20:01] while he was in his mothers right I
[1:20:03] believe we can pray and ask God to do
[1:20:05] that for our children Amen to fill them
[1:20:08] with the Holy Spirit they might come
[1:20:10] into this life knowing who they are
[1:20:13] they're a son and daughter of God
[1:20:16] glory I like the scripture my mother had
[1:20:18] in her bag she carried around all the
[1:20:20] time brother de she went to Brother Tim
[1:20:22] she said the more I pray for that boy
[1:20:24] the worse
[1:20:25] get brother Tim said praise God sister
[1:20:29] one of these days he's going to get so
[1:20:30] bad he'll hate himself and that's what
[1:20:32] it took I had to hate myself but you
[1:20:36] know she held this one rock train up a
[1:20:40] child good when it gets old it won't
[1:20:43] depart from you might depart from it but
[1:20:45] it won't depart from you you know what
[1:20:47] that's what when everybody else is going
[1:20:48] to do something brother they was
[1:20:50] something condemn me I said man we
[1:20:51] shouldn't do that stuff man they said
[1:20:53] man what do you mean ain't that R said
[1:20:55] man it just ain't right you know what
[1:20:57] the one would get in trouble they do it
[1:20:59] and I'd get to
[1:21:00] blame because I was with the wrong
[1:21:03] crowd the other guys are way by while I
[1:21:05] went in the police
[1:21:08] car I said
[1:21:11] look that was hey they was giving me
[1:21:13] their
[1:21:14] rocks I was guilty because Association
[1:21:19] you know what when we're born in this
[1:21:21] life this natural birth we're Guilty By
[1:21:23] Association
[1:21:25] we come through the wrong desire through
[1:21:27] an act of man and woman coming together
[1:21:29] inste the spoken word we're Guilty By
[1:21:32] Association the first qualification of a
[1:21:35] Preacher is to be blameless amen and
[1:21:38] without the Holy Ghost there's none of
[1:21:39] us blameless I know there are certain
[1:21:41] things that we have this qualifies them
[1:21:43] to but the main thing is the Holy
[1:21:46] Ghost he forgives us of all things he
[1:21:50] changes Our Lives I know we can mess
[1:21:52] oursel up and disqualify our
[1:21:56] but I'm thankful that God kept me right
[1:21:58] he kept me cuz I was going to boo boo
[1:22:00] boo and he kept me right he kept me in
[1:22:03] his hand I mean I still had smoked and
[1:22:05] done those things should do but he held
[1:22:07] me cuz he had work for me to do I'm glad
[1:22:10] he's able to do that right he kept the
[1:22:12] prophet didn't he but the prophet need
[1:22:15] the Holy Ghost too didn't he right he
[1:22:17] was going to kill him oh yeah he was
[1:22:20] going to kill him boys with the 22 rifle
[1:22:22] oh yeah and the man that pours this dog
[1:22:24] he said I was going to kill
[1:22:27] him see why we need the Holy Ghost oh
[1:22:29] yeah the only thing control this desires
[1:22:33] but said you're never going to perfect
[1:22:34] this man he's a cuckle bir people get
[1:22:37] around you know a lot of people get head
[1:22:39] and I know God use lot and some of us in
[1:22:41] different levels of maturity people I
[1:22:44] get people they say man I I'm already
[1:22:46] perfect oh yeah I'm like woo and that's
[1:22:49] a powerful Stone that's right that's a
[1:22:52] powerful Stone right I don't know no one
[1:22:54] that was perfect that walked on this
[1:22:56] Earth that was Jesus Christ we're coming
[1:22:59] to Perfection the only only thing
[1:23:01] perfect about us is his blood his blood
[1:23:04] was the perfect atonement for me and you
[1:23:06] his blood cleanses us from all sin he
[1:23:09] said though your sins be as scarling
[1:23:12] they
[1:23:13] was people say well you know you
[1:23:16] know I never done all those things I
[1:23:19] never done all those things I'm already
[1:23:20] there but you know what a lot of people

[1:23:22] right just like they are no you ever
[1:23:24] went out the World never done you just
[1:23:25] sit right here in this on this Pew and
[1:23:27] die and go to hell right exactly oh yes
[1:23:30] it's a very dangerous thing right am the
[1:23:33] thinking that your own righteousness is
[1:23:35] good look at the Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:23:37] they thought their righteousness was
[1:23:38] good enough look when they went down and
[1:23:40] the one went down to pray and the other
[1:23:41] one the old siner was there yeah he knew
[1:23:44] how to pray right we got to watch how we
[1:23:46] pray he said I'm glad I'm not like this
[1:23:48] man
[1:23:49] come Wonder a lot of times that we not
[1:23:51] think that way a long brother I'm glad
[1:23:53] I'm you know what and I had the Lord he
[1:23:56] was dealing with me I went and seeing
[1:23:57] the guy brother Aaron and he's a good
[1:23:59] friend of mine he had a breakdown Lord
[1:24:02] it just got a hold of me started moving
[1:24:04] in my life and changing things I went to
[1:24:06] visit him and he had had a mental
[1:24:08] breakdown you know what humbled me is
[1:24:11] when I went to see that guy the Holy
[1:24:13] Spirit spoke to me and said that could
[1:24:14] have been you
[1:24:16] right that could have been me laying out
[1:24:18] there drunk in that gutter when I ride
[1:24:20] by and I see that drunker or that
[1:24:21] homeless man or that prostitute right
[1:24:25] that could have been us it's not for
[1:24:28] Grace I'd have been nothing more than
[1:24:30] the empty space if not for Grace a
[1:24:34] wasted
[1:24:35] life a wasted life is a life that's not
[1:24:38] lived for Christ Jesus amen you know
[1:24:41] what he bring us in this life that we
[1:24:42] might live for
[1:24:44] him I'm so glad that God has given this
[1:24:48] us the ability through the born and
[1:24:49] again experience of God glory you know
[1:24:53] there's a lot of shapes and sizes of
[1:24:55] rocks in our lives you know just because
[1:24:58] it's a little Pebble of
[1:24:59] sand we think that might not be but you
[1:25:01] know what if there's enough sand in your
[1:25:04] sack pick up a little old bag of sand
[1:25:06] that's about 3
[1:25:09] lb and pick up a bag of rocks is 3 lb
[1:25:12] they weigh the
[1:25:13] same they're just bigger there's more of
[1:25:17] them it's just a rock pulverized down to
[1:25:19] the size of sand right A lot of times
[1:25:21] we're carrying around a big old bag of
[1:25:22] sand and we don't realize we have Ro
[1:25:24] rocks in our bags we think those little
[1:25:26] he said last side he said what the
[1:25:29] problem is is we have the little foxes
[1:25:32] yeah that small spoth the vine it's the
[1:25:35] little things says it's the little bitty
[1:25:37] things we left undone right and they add
[1:25:40] up and they add up you know what every
[1:25:43] time we come to the house of God every
[1:25:45] time we come to the to the house of God
[1:25:47] we either leave Better or Worse exactly
[1:25:51] we have to be careful what we pick up at
[1:25:52] church you know a lot of us in this
[1:25:54] church and we leave more weighted down
[1:25:56] than we did when we come
[1:25:58] here you know why because we pick up a
[1:26:01] lot of things that other people are
[1:26:03] letting go of we go down and pick up our
[1:26:05] brothers and our sisters rocks oh that
[1:26:08] God has delivered them from we end up
[1:26:10] when we don't come to the house of God
[1:26:12] with the right M attitude we don't come
[1:26:14] with the right expectation then we leave
