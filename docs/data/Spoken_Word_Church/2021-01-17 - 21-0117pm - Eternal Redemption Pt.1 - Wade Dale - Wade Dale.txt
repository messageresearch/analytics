it more clearly because they're proven what they are but we're also going to prove who we are so yeah your brother kern let us watch that last night it was a pastor of a methodist church prayed over the house and sent it and he prayed to several gods one monotheism and one other one and allah and the other one and then he said amen and a woman at the end of the service how horrible that the place we've come to used to it meant something you know brother brown said our nation was founded on christian religion but boy somewhere she got off the path but we knew she would because she turned him down in 1956 she turned god down in 1956 we believe what the prophet said she'll never come back amen and he said i believe she'll either take it or turn it down well you know what happened she turned it down she being this nation so um but you know what god's still blessing us i wouldn't live anywhere else wouldn't let sorry you can say him i wouldn't live anything i'd like to go to alaska maybe live in different parts but uh bro chris it'd be nice to go up there for a little while always told that i said you know if if the lord said now brother wait i need you to go to like nicaragua or somewhere i'm like well lord let's pray about this but but now if he said now once you go to alaska i'd be like that was you lord yeah but luis would be different he's cause he's going nicaragua yeah we'll get ready to go so it's just different i don't speak the language down there i can't speak their language so but good to be in house of lord good to be back we're going to start a new series i notice you if you'll notice i've got these little uh we will not be using it today because we're going to be before creation all right uh we were at the colleges last night and that we were talking about how that hey brother lewis brother bob brother william we seem to can't get out of genesis in revelation we can't seem to get out of the mind of god because when i started the series on the two spirits we went back in you know when satan was created or lucifer was created and so now we're going way on back and we're going to talk about eternal redemption and we're the only people in this world that know the right plan of redemption the bride of jesus christ taking the message of the hour from the prophet that said let's go back into the back part of god's mind and unveil it today in christ the mystery of god reveal i had already picked out the same quote brother louise read that long when he read wednesday night and i'd already picked parts of all those out so we're we're kind of all uh we're rowing in the same yeah it's hot jim can you turn the air on just push it all the way down where it says fan yep right over right there you have a new job now you can't say i don't know what to look for but we're all kind of rowing in the same direction i hope but we're always actually in the same water so listen it's for somebody it's got to be for us to keep circling around the same place i told y'all back in june or july when we when the a lot of new ones were coming in and being baptized and the kids have started young adults and started paying more attention to the to the message or to the to what's being preached i was remember i was praying and god i would say god we we can't leave these people behind and remember what the lord told me he said he i'm coming back to get him don't worry well listen you can only come back so many times because there's one time when god said that's it he played with them for 400 years they got to cadence bernie and god said you either are going to go in or are you going to die right here and a lot of them died so please don't die god has come to get us all he has looped back to get the ones that maybe i don't mean say slow in in in um man's knowledge but we're all slowing god's knowledge there's revelation we still need all of us brother dale's been 50 60 years in the message and they still revelation he needs so you know i'm not saying that i'm just saying some of us though some of us though come in kicking and screaming something comes in like you know when i i took math classes in school and man i love math and i could just get in it's like brother joe and i were talking about chess and i'm just going to say this is it's just it just came to me he said boy you get in the chat playing chess he said you know man it i said yeah luisa get into it he'd miss church to play play chess so but i mean every time there's a chess game going you know i go out and start doing something else digging a hole or working on a car that i don't know nothing about but brother luis will say yeah let's play chess we'll see that's the way it is with the word of god some are like that some wouldn't miss an opportunity to read the word of god listen to a tape fellowship with the brothers others would just say yeah i'm part of that but you'll go do something else okay so you just got you who's got to decide that you decide that amen so when it comes to the word of god it's the same way but today we're going to start on this redemption now we did this in a part i think brother joe i looked way on back it may have been like even 2005 or six or seven i did this and we we renovated this chart a couple of times since then but we're going to try to go through the complete plan of redemption but we're going to go and pull it out in pieces instead of just running through here because you you know we're going to take at the very end we'll run through every bit of this but when we get to the church ages we're going to see what paul taught irene has taught different ones we're going to see what moses did with the ten commandments as we were talking last night where the prophet of god called them the seals to those people and we're going to look at the old testament because listen every piece is a plan of redemption the old testament is part of the plan of redemption whether it didn't redeem one person like we are talking about redemption it was part of the redemption process amen because it was jehovah it was christ in moses christ in david remember and then we come to the fullness of the godhead body this brother dale's talking about we're going to just all intertwine again today too as we did this morning but you know what it does it keeps your mind fresh keeps your mind fresh when one brings it one way and one brings it another we're all going the same direction so also i'd like to announce that brother uh aaron will not be preaching for us anymore because he's not preaching on wednesday night and i gotta preach so he ain't preaching tomorrow this week no he's working late and i understand i told him i said well he said well i might not get there at 7 30. i said you don't start preaching at 7 30 anyway but he'll want to come in in this dirty clothes so bless his heart so i'll be doing sunday wednesday service pray for june and i we're going to south carolina as soon as we leave here and going to visit her dad for because i'm off tomorrow because it's a federal holiday so i'm off tomorrow and we're going to go see him for for a little while also next sunday brother chris long will be here with us and he will be speaking on that both services on that sunday's everybody got that say amen on february the 6th don't forget the banquet it's pretty parents are telling you about sign up downstairs we've got some young people that are going to serve for us that will be serving for no ain't nobody younger than you look behind you buddy sorry all right i'm looking at you and also before we forget it this comes up on people just like christmas june the 17th through the 19th we have the lodge rented again you say that's in june don't worry a lot of you'll come up three days before and go oh it's father's day it's on the calendar but june the 17th through the 19th we'll be having our father's day fishing trip just like we did last year so just keep that in your mind and put that on your calendar also i will be doing brother chris long's gonna have a weekend uh easter service uh april the second third and fourth and i'll be doing it for him so just keep us in your prayers that kind of gets gets you caught up with everything so let's go to hebrews 9 11. and let's look why you know when you say eternal redemption boy you it really you say well you think of everlasting and all these different covenants redemption is not temporary now we won't need redemption as far as the new birth once you get the new birth but there still is it's going to carry with us the whole time we're going to realize brother chris that we were lost we're not going to get a future home and go oh i can't remember nothing no you're going to remember who you are where you came from but now the former things will be passed away the old things the things that hurt you the things that but you're going to remember all the good things amen and you'll remember because you know what when jesus when he walks up to us and holds his hands up like this you're going to see that that's eternal redemption because that body that's being made that has been made eternal is going to have scars still in it for an eternity amen so we're going to start with eternal redemption the plan part one let's bow our heads the heavenly father thank you for the day thank you for the words you give us already lord i pray that you would now anoint us for this journey for a little while lord that you would speak to your people you'd be the active participant in this service father you'd be the one that does the speaking father says anyone needs healing we pray that you'd heal their body lord number one though we pray that you'd heal the soul that you would take someone lord and take them through that new birth through justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost and and bring them into your kingdom because we still believe the plan of redemption is going on lord until you get to the day that you take that even when you take the gentiles away there's still going to be a plan of redemption for the jews and then the plan of redemption for the earth which we'll cover uh far from here but lord just keep us in the center lord where we can we can see what's going on and and and not be worried about what's going on in the world lord but when we come together lord let us talk about you and let us let us say things that are pleasing to you father let our conversation be about you lord just lead us and guide us by your holy spirit bless us lord take care of us be with brother chris as he travels here lord next week about friday and be with him in his travels there we pray that you just touch him now in jesus name amen and good to have brother chris reynolds back with us amen he he's lost a little hair since the last time we've seen him but he has a new job but it's closer to here it's right around the corner at kubota and he's living in cleveland so this is where you ought to be hebrews 9 verse 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building in other words paul's talking about what went on back in the old testament as far as the the bulls and the goats and the hanging of the badger skin and all these different things holy of holies he's saying it's not there now it's more perfect tabernacle it's like brother dale's name flesh now all right neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered it once into the holy place and here's my point having obtained eternal redemption for us now that comes from the bible can't be changed but he obtained remember you can be seated the prophet of god told us he said jesus didn't come to bring in your inheritance that's kind of strange because we all thought no that's why jesus uh he came to what he said i am the way the truth and the life i am the way back to your inheritance brother i'm saying your inheritance was before the foundation of the world so i want us to see that that god has when this plan developed i can i want you to do something for me even today i want you to go home and just for a few minutes sit down and say i am god and just sit down and just let the plan of redemption unfold in your head now it doesn't have to be that's what i'm trying to break it down really intricate and get the little the little uh minute details but just be god and know that like brother dale said he he couldn't be the fullness of the godhead bodily at 12 years old yet inside of that man potentially was that part of him he didn't change persons you didn't change persons brother brown said when you got the new birth it was you and god together as persons amen so here we are we see a man standing and he was a man before the foundation of the world and he was as you would say like brother branham would say taking the picture but i would like to see a a man standing here a young boy and he's standing here in front of a desk floating out in eternity no no star no earth to put his feet on he's just right out there in eternity and he's just he's standing on something what he's standing on his revelation he's standing on his eternal foundation and brother chris he goes okay this is the way it's going to be we're going to put that over there we're going to put that because this whole thing that you see right here this was already in the mind of god before there was anything right before there was anything brother brown tells us how many people have you heard in any i say denomination in any form go on youtube go on different ones they never say let's go back into the back part of god's mind let's go back into eternity nobody ever does that they deal with what's right here they can't without the new birth you can't be in the mind of god you can't know what god knows but if you do have the new birth folks that's what i'm telling you you can go home today and say well now brother wait i don't understand it like you do you can understand it like you do right you got the same new birth i do you got the same holy ghost that wrote the bible you're just not letting him work that's our problem brother brown said the holy ghost is a gentleman glory if you don't want him to go through that door he's not going to bust that board that door down and go into whatever door in your heart or door something you harbor and it doesn't have to be sin it just has to be maybe i don't like to do this or i don't like to do that or something back and forth but let god in your house first you get god in your house right get god in your house and you have obtained an eternal he obtained eternal redemption what he got it from what before that he got it from the father amen amen but he was the father made manifest that's the son amen same person because listen we'll go to this first quote but listen that having obtained eternal redemption for us he didn't remember again it was a shocker when i read this quote jesus christ never came to bring you your inheritance that's right that even proves it right there having obtained eternal redemption for us his body he had to obtain redemption of his body amen amen it wasn't eternal it wasn't eternal until the death burial resurrection but he's the only one who could do that right because remember we'll get into it when we get into time because we're not going to be in time this is all the time and the seven dimensions and all that we'll get into that a little bit later but this is before as brother brown says before the eternal but now remember remember an eternal covenant or an eternal redemption never had a beginning and it'll never have an end right thereby got eternal but now there's many times that god has made an everlasting or a conditional covenant first thing in the garden don't eat of that do eat of that you'll live you'll die all right that's not unconditional though that's if adam didn't do that but now remember that's why i love the scripture we'll read it a little bit of genesis 3 15 he said i will put enmity i will many times we're going to read to when abraham during his journey we're going to read in genesis 12 where god says i will i will i will i will it's not abraham if you will he didn't ever say now abraham if you'll believe what i said no no he never said that it was many though everlasting covenants because god made an everlasting covenant with a rainbow but that's everlasting it's not eternal he'll make he made an everlasting covenant with different people down through time but that that everlasting covenant is done away with but an eternal covenant you can never do away with when god says i will so god in the beginning as the man i said is standing in his at his board here and he's already a creator because he had to create the board brother chris you got what i said nobody else did but anyway um so you look at god he's sitting here and he's going and listen i like what brother dale said and i hope he gets on the the um predestination because that's what i'm gonna cover a little bit but see god didn't just say this is it come on right because it's depending on your choice i thought so what you chose god knew if you had let's just say you had five choices in your life just say if brother louise had five choices in his life god knew all five how they would begin what would happen in his life who he he would not marry and marry and not have kids and have kids and if he did every one of them god would know why that you say oh brother wait no he's infinite an infinite god knows but by foreknowledge by what we're talking about right now this is for f-o-r-e for knowledge god could stand at his big booth here have you ever thought about this and every person that breathed a breath of life he knew when they would come what their choice would be and what would their choice be if they chose something else standing right here every person there's 7 billion people in the world now there's probably about 20 or so billion people in the ground that come from back from the flood back to here and he knew every one of them and what they would do and every choice that could be made every variable brother brother joe and i he didn't know i was going to preach on this but he got back there talking about chess he said in the first four moves of chess after the first four moves of chess there's not billions so many billions of different moves that you can make and that's just playing in a little board about this big much less an infant god you understand what i mean whatever move you made he knew that and if you didn't make that move he knew what was going to happen but to be god that's the way it had to be but listen you and i can't sit here though and fathom that in our brain it would drive us crazy right so he condescended yeah so that he could say let there be now we can understand that so we can say i'm going to create a ball call the earth i'm going to put it just far enough from the sun and i'm going to put my people on it let us make man in our image right so we take this god we can't understand down to a god now that we can understand but he doesn't change he didn't leave he didn't leave the father because the son did to create him but who did the speaking the word did the speaking but it wasn't it's like we were talking about last night but you got to remember one thing when you take jesus in the father when he says i only do that now you and i we have arguments in our brain every day with our self and you know what sometimes that might be god that you're arguing with hello but jesus never had a day when he got up and eat breakfast in the morning that he said something and the one inside of him said that's not right because he but remember he was the fullness he came without a carnal mind he came without a sex veil over his face amen our problem is is we got a past and it's kind of sorted because we don't know what but jesus knew his past that's right it was back there with the father he in john 17 he said oh pray father we'll get into it i'm way i'm moving on down this way through the message he said i want to have glory with you like we had before the foundation of the world it wasn't two people right but his plan of redemption was unfolding because he had to stand at his desk one day and say i gotta go save those people because this is the choices they made right and i go i'm going to have a group of people i'm going to have children there's lucifer you're not even in the picture buddy he helped fulfill this but remember if lucifer hadn't come there would have been none of this there would have just been god right up here at the top the seventh dimension and it would have been all of his bride spoken into existence and we'd lived in need and that would have been it i wouldn't say that was boring but there would be no plan there would be no your choice there would be no judge there would be no uh there would be no savior i'm going to read that quote to give him purpose to give god the ultimate purpose of all these different titles he had to put man in human flesh but before he did now here we go now here's number one before he put us in human flesh remember he's already know he already it's already he's already in the future home knows what's going to happen knows who's coming on the scene know who's going to do what no hitler was coming when he did this one was coming you you moses and you pharaoh and you everybody was coming in these places and he just wrote it out in the plan of redemption in the bible before the foundation of the world right and we're going to cover that because keep that in your mind keep the book in your mind amen now not a physical book everybody got that say amen not a physical book what's this old saying is i can read you like a a what i can read you like a book then that must be who you are you are the book that book of redemption that was open it's not a physical book that was me and you he opened the seals and revealed you the full plan of redemption so let's just read this number one right if i don't get through this i'm going to stop at 3 30 and we'll continue on wednesday since this ain't gonna nobody preach on wednesday night i guess i'll do it that's a good song that's good did a good job job the oldest book in the bible was supposed to even be written before moses wrote genesis but the oldest book in the bible was speaking of redemption and yet redemption was far way before that hold on a minute look redemption was way before job wrote it in a book redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even before the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of that god foreseeing now there we go for knowledge he foreknew all things glory and what did it matter if it took him billions of years to see it all unfold he's eternal it doesn't really matter he probably saw it in an instant god foreseeing we might get into that a little bit with dimensions do you know when they talk about dimensions they all if you travel fast enough even in a a spaceship that when you come back you're not as old as you were when you left because your body is either speeding up or slowing down we'll talk about that a little bit later but it's already proven and that's what they're trying to do with with the uh moving people around you know taking them from one position put them in another like they did on star star trek oh star trek yeah i didn't you watched it didn't you you watched that on hulu didn't you think of that well you know i really think about though man has tapped into god's library that's what we've been talking about they know that there is a way to transport ask phillip asked phillip phillip was right here for one minute with a eunuch and all of a sudden he's over here in a revival and he didn't even say beat me up scotty y'all know what i'm going by now don't you but they would show them in that transporter room and what all of a sudden they'd get real fuzzy what breaking the atoms apart and send them in another and that's what they're doing but you know what that's what god did when he came back when he came back and walked through the wall and appeared to the disciples same thing happened he just broke his he just broke his atoms up walked right through the wall and put him right back together that's why you and i will travel like i thought because we'll have a same body like he had and he was walking on this earth and it was just still old felt the earth planet of redemption was not finished yet physically now when i say physically we know the plan of redemption i'm telling you was finished way before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain we'll read that in a minute before the foundation world but it had to physically happen on the earth right so god foreseeing and making a way of redemption before he even made the world for the bible plainly says that christ was predestinated for ordained and was the lamb of god slain before the foundation of the world that's right way before the world was made god had a plan of redemption that's why adam could do what he did and not get by with it but not be destroyed by it got it first corinthians two verse six well when i started doing this i really enjoy this so if y'all don't enjoy this i'm going to enjoy it right here i'm going to get in my little eternal bubble and i'm going to enjoy it right here i told brother kern and emma that we're we're just in this we're in this bubble we're into the if you don't get in god's bubble you're out in the world there's a protection that you can walk into this redemptive plan this eternal plan of god and be part of it or you can stay out there in the world that's right howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that what come to naught do you know one day as brother dale was talking about we see how that the bible tells us that just fear the second death because one day the soul if bill gates or whoever never gets born again he's just going to go away the greatest men in the world we've seen all the great people the great great leaders great minds of this world one day they're just gonna vanish never to be remembered again yeah that'd be hell enough for me to know that one day i was just gonna go completely out of distance and they're just not gonna be me no more but boy thank god for a plan of redemption that you can get inside that plan of redemption and you can just what eternal redemption it doesn't end amen nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained look now before the world unto our glory not his our glory titus 1 verse 1. paul a servant of jesus christ and an apostle a paul servant of god an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness watch in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began promised remember the bible said he could swear by no other so he swore by himself but how did this but how does this develop but hath in due times manifest is his word through preaching so in other words there's a plan of redemption out there but somebody's got to get it to you right some's got to accept it somebody's got to live it so through preaching which is committed unto me paul now be careful according to the commandment of god our savior and we've read this scripture many times go to ephesians 1. we've read this scripture many times but i've never read it like this before this is the plan of redemption in about 11 verses give me ephesians 1 and i can explain the plan of redemption from ephesians 1. paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus so it's not to everybody it's to the saints and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world but now wait a minute that's not the whole plan that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ what to himself according to the good pleasure of his will i i've always said if if you were to see that young 20 year old god i hate it when the world pictures god as a 80 year old man they can't hardly walk this is god no god's a 20 year old kid but he's standing there and he's going stop right there don't you think god's got a sense of humor he made you didn't he he made you didn't he that's what somebody says god got a sense of humor look at the platypus you know what platypus he's got like four different identities of four different animals in one but no look i think look according look i'm joking but look according to the good pleasure of his will his pleasure wants to have me and you here in all of our inadequacies and everything when david is the apple of god's eye yet he had his best friend murdered because he had committed adultery to the praise of the glory of his grace now remember god doesn't need grace we need grace god is grace but we need grace so if this is all this and all this blessing is being heaped on me and you wherein he has made us accepted in jesus christ who is the perfect one and to whom we have what redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now watch wherein he hath abounded that's heath on we have to bound it toward us in all wisdom and prudence oh man i paul listen if brother branham could go back in the back part of god's mind he couldn't write the bible again but he could tell us what the bible said but now paul i believe went back in the back part of god's mind and god said this is what i want you to write down sorry paul wrote 80 of the new testament which is what the eternal word of god glory wearing he hath the bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence look having made known unto us the mystery of his will and christ the mystery of god revealed you were the mystery that was to be revealed which is christ in you the hope of glory right amen according to his good pleasure there he is again which he has purpose in himself in other words like i said his eternal covenant i will it doesn't abraham you can give your wife away twice i don't care i know at the end you're going to have a child i know you're going to believe me i know you me all of us are going to go out in the world for 20 years and do what we want to do but i know that when i come to you and say hey buddy this is it that you're going to respond in the way that you that god saw you respond before the foundation of the world folks let me tell you something god wrote every word of this bible for the people that are reading it glory that's right he did not write it to the whole world because he had you and mine when he wrote it now the world can read it and to some people it's a good story but to us it's god speaking to me and you i like that song i think zach williams sings it before i was made you wrote down my name and we're going to read the scripture a minute it's going to prove that before you were even made before your mom and daddy even before your mom and dad's mom and dad and mom and dad mom and dad was ever born god knew who you were and wrote you in a book right this whole bible is developed because of what christian people chose right i just believe that i just believe that have he made known unto who us not the world the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure when he has purpose in himself look that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that's right now in the 2000 years that it took for us to see there was a redeemer come on earth to this day here right here in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him now watch in whom also we have obtained an inheritance oh no i was born before the foundational world though i had to see it inside of me when i come forget it yeah right you got to obtain you got to fight for your redemption we know it's already set in god's mind no doubt but you and i don't even know what the next 10 minutes is going to bring he does and we don't go through it like this either nope you're a free moral agent until the day you pass away or we take a body change amen in him also we have obtained an inheritance now who do we obtain it from not jesus christ remember he didn't come to bring you an inheritance but if we connect ourselves to the way the truth and the life there our inheritance was before the foundational world you and i got to realize it and when brother branham come i mean that's a great thing when he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal yeah no doubt right but you got to receive it right he'll go on and people will just go right over the statement the little thing that he says he says now abraham lincoln this man goes to abraham lincoln and he says my buddy didn't shoot that guy but they're going to kill him tomorrow abraham lincoln writes down pardoned abraham lincoln the buddy takes it and says hey buddy look this is he didn't accept it right right right a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received or accepted as a pardon that's the same way with me and you you've got to accept that now once you become and you become quickened as paul says by the word of god then you realize then you know by when you read this right here when you read you predestinated and somebody like brother wade walks up and talks about eternal redemption having obtained eternal redemption for us you know that before the foundation of the world it was god that did it but it was god that saw what you would do oh i wish people could see that even people in the message can't even see that they just think i always was i'm going to tell you people something that's a lie the devil just like a father son holy ghost baptism let that soak in for a minute because a lie is a lie and it becomes the worst lie when they bring in the message and tell people they always was it doesn't matter you believe brother brown was a prophet yeah sure i do brother well you're well you always was eternal what about all this obtaining people what about all this striving what about all this fighting jesus even said he said the kingdom of god is taken by force not a flowery bread a bed of ease what take all that overcoming out of the what makes my righteous thing the nation get up take all that overcoming out of revelations then if you just always got it what you got to overcome come on all right let's get off of that and also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according what to the purpose that purpose before the foundational world that purpose he purposed i am going to have children on the earth that are my children right and i'm going to make a way for them to get back to that amen but i got to put them in human flesh so they make a choice listen let me tell you something that genesis 1 26 man don't make the choice now it always was eternal right but remember it wasn't in you you had to remember we bypassed that to come by mom and daddy to come by carnal knowledge to come by the fall to let this catch up to us yes then when they come together oh then you can say i always was eternal oh lord fill me up i've been waiting you've been waiting for an eternity for me to get here boy talk about patience being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things because remember you say well no you just said that we had a will listen i'm telling you though when god says i'm going to have a group of people i'm going to have a bride then that means he's going to have a bride devil can't do anything about it you can't do anything about it except get in it accept it and get in it then god saw that you did accept it and he had a scripture for you and a scripture for you and the scripture for you that quickened listen all of us didn't come the same way some would have come by by here at the altar someone would have come by laying on of hands some would have come by like i did was sitting in a in a camper in in lake malone in texas i mean uh texas kentucky yeah amen but i was caught i was reading the word of god the bible says while the word was being preached the holy ghost fell on the people amen amen see that's where i accepted it i've heard it for years i've heard it since i was a little boy right but look what did it do it put me into his perfect will this is all permissive we were born permissive because you know what god when he said genesis 1 26 he said this is my plan this is going to be my kids they're going to come to adam and eve right that's it but it didn't but he knew that amen we'll get to that in just a second let's go to revelations 13 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him who the beast whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world that's right and it doesn't stop me when brother branham says if you weren't there you're never going to be there that's all right you know why because god saw you'd never want it that bothered me for years you all know that it bothered me years that that that god would let maybe somebody just go a certain point in life or let somebody like adolf hitler come into the world or let let them continue on if i was god if they started messing with my kids i'd be just like but god allowed him listen by his end just because of his infinite mercy that that that donny comes to christ he knew that adolf hitler if he let adolf hitler live 1 million 2 million 3 million years adolf hitler would never come to the knowledge that he needed jesus christ as a savior but i'll guarantee you though when adolf hitler walks up to the day of judgment christ is going to say i came to you in 1935 or 36 or 32 and i came to you on this day and you turned me down that's what made you who you are because you accepted the demon and you didn't accept me amen but now remember see god foresaw that knew what was going to happen so he didn't have to give him eternal life because he knew he would never accept it see to me that makes everything plain that makes it that god's not a judge he's not a i had a preacher one time in the message said that god was a respecter of persons people well see he had to build his case that we always were eternal that was his case building i said brother your prophet about 85 times and i don't even need the prophet i got 16 scriptures in the bible that said god is not a respecter of persons if he what listen if god respected one person above me and you we could walk up to the day of judgment and say you treated him different than you did me you can't judge me for that but see we can't do that he's not a respecter of person he'll he would have saved adolf hitler he'd have saved cain we know that it was in the bible right he would have saved judas oh no yes he would have brother branham said judas's problem was he didn't make it to pentecost but see god knew that and that went into the plan of god that he was not and listen and i know listen see you got quotes from brother man said he was born the son of perdition no he was born judas he had a choice but god knew though before the foundation of the world what his choice would be so therefore he could call him the son of perdition same way with satan he said i created you perfect we read that yeah all right here we go number two christ the mystery of god reveal he has showed or revealed in every type that's in the bible now when we start through this we're going to start into the old we're going to start in the old testament all right because you have to old testament's just as part of the plan of redemption as the new testament is all right that's what gets me about these uh men and women you start talking about dress and hair and all this stuff oh that's just old testament well you got 10 commandments out there in your yard don't you where'd that come from i come from the old testament kick it out like you kicked the other stuff out right but not it's just as important it's just as important he has showed or revealed in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible thank god for a prophet is the revelation of god's mystery in christ now i'm going to give you a definition of the word christ because remember jesus the flesh doesn't come into existence except two thousand years ago everybody got that say amen those of you that are asleep you can just keep on sleeping okay but this whole mystery is not wrapped up in one you say well now be careful but listen christ was before the foundation of the world jesus the flesh was not that's our savior that's our lamb that's the one that had that what took my sin because christ can't sin christ is not a sinner that's why i said that genesis 1 26 man's not a sinner we became a sinner because we didn't accept it that way our adam and eve sold us out we'll get to that the entire bible look is an expression of what now one goal that god had right but it's it it encompasses all this we're going to talk about but it's one goal the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type now listen you and i are not a type oh yeah we we we could be a type of christ that's okay but listen everything in the bible types the bride right right everything that's why he said look every type that's in the bible type in what christ where's christ christ in you not christ up in heaven like brother brown says like and that really he's true a lot of denominations can't get jesus off the cross he died for me two thousand years ago and that's all they say and they accept that no they ain't all of it he had to come back and get inside me and you and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it glory and god's help well you'll see it right here this morning wow how positive what the lord has had in his mind all along you know a man couldn't say that unless he knew what he was talking about remember the box car was sealed up and it was just presuming we're just presuming unless that thing's open but when the seal's open remember what he said he said if you're missing the seals come back to this message right here the great expression of the seals is christ in you the hope of glory that christ is not in heaven christ is not in denominations christ is not even in the bible that's written words yeah right christ is an anointing amen now when he anoints what's in the bible that's him but you can read hey they read the bible and make him a trinity that is not the christ amen no false doctrine can be christ he can allow things to happen we know that his permissive will he allowed it to happen but now right here in this last day he has revealed it and shows it what a great thing let's go to revelations 12. no i'm sorry i'm sorry you're you're right i'm wrong i missed the page somewhere what am i doing here what am i doing you got me all messed up thinking about you singing that song with that pretty girl up here greek lexicon told you i'd get it in luis all right so let's look this is the definition of christ now i want to show you something here we know that christ is the anointing but we know that christ is the one that created all things when they were talking to jesus they couldn't understand the flesh standing there but peter says darth to cross the son of the living god which was spoken of he said my father revealed that to you but then in the bible it says we know you created all things well now they weren't they they had a they had a mystery there that this flesh guy that they saw several of them saw him come from a baby all the way up they had a problem with that even the pharisees had uh wait a minute before abraham was you what before abraham was you were what he said before abraham was i am what was speaking that was the one inside doing the speaking amen because jesus was lying if he was talking about this guy you the flesh guy right but he was talking about he was talking from within glory like brother we were talking about the other night hattie wright said the right thing it did not come from her persona it came from what was inside of her the holy ghost spoke and said the salvation of my two children because no one can give salvation except jesus christ that christ that was speaking back to what brother brown said that's why i'm telling you when you get the same when you hit the same spot that she hit when you say that ain't nothing but the truth in your revelation not hers that's a good story you understand what i mean but it's got to be personally to you when you stand one day and say when you stand up one day in this service and you say brother dale that ain't nothing but the truth you'll see things happen because what it done was it moved two people that were not born again i don't care what they say happened to them in that afterwards them two kids got eternal life y'all believe that i believe that i don't care about what nobody else believes but she said the salvation of my two kids and she got what she asked for and that's the same way brother dale's you're gonna have to keep saying my body's gonna be changed my body's healed my body's going to be changed i'm going to be changed in the moment in twinkling i believe what that bible says i believe what that says i don't care if i keep getting stooped and i can't say my words without breathing heavy you didn't have to laugh that loud i'm in better shape than i have been before but look i don't see how these preachers can run around all over the building for an hour and a half but this is the christ this was what was standing this was the guy that was standing in eternity the anointing the anointed person but what look consecrating jesus to the messiah office and furnishing him with the necessary powers for its administration right what brother braham say when you get the holy ghost he said god equips you for your journey that's what the christ is it equips you for your journey that's why i'm telling you we don't know what's going to happen this year but if you'll let that man talk to you inside he'll tell you what's going to happen this year and he will give you supernatural instruction on what to do but look i like this part enduring christians with the gifts of the holy spirit christ in you the hope of glory glory now look i want to show you something too though remember look by the revelation we see that christ was the one that was spoke through moses we're going to look at just a second a few of these examples christ spoke to abraham christ spoke through isaac he spoke to jacob but it was furnishing them for their journey so what is it doing for you it's furnishing you for your journey but moses journey was not my journey right i am not commissioned today to lead two million jews to a promised land but he was so that was christ brother brown said christ in moses right now not when he killed an egyptian not when he done the things wrong he did not when david went and had his best friend killed but when david stood up that day and he said i'll not leave my soul in hell or see my holy ones brother said a backslidden prophet jesus raised on a backslidden prophet's message but it was god that spoke that message that's the difference you got to remember you got to remember is it christ speaking or is it you speaking so let's look at a few examples in doing christians with the gifts of the holy ghost but now look let's go back to this this right here we know in the river jordan we know he got an anointing but that was anointing that was an anointing to create that was not an anointing to create things that was before the foundation of the world that anointing before the foundation of the world that christ he was anointed to create glory but now that anointing though had to come into human flesh so that the flesh could die for you that's right christ can't die christ can't sin christ is that genesis 1 26 man that's right but he gives you furnishes you with the necessary powers for what the administration it needs for the time adam let's go let's look at adam now here's adam adam's not a creator but adam takes creation and moves it around he has power over creation right brother brown said just as christ broods over the earth is what led the animals well that was through a through adam that was through adam because adam was was the ruler of the world right right so he was endued with that christ but now not when he did there at the end and that's what we were talking about last night adam couldn't be anything but the first adam he couldn't be the second adam because the second adam is one that could die for us and come back into us but the first adam he thought he maybe could save eve that's why i can't stand the doctrine they have of adam having to place a natural seed into eve to save her sex don't save nobody texas what's killing us all right now you understand what i mean but adam couldn't be a savior that was not in him it was in him to be a ruler it was in him to be what to be christ on the earth at that time to rule the animals and the wind and the storms and all whatever right but when adam walked out with eve brother brown said though that was christ he said because christ took on our sin as adam took on eve sin and walked out of the garden with her now see i can take that i'm not gonna take that he had sexual relationship with her to savor no adam seed natural seed is what's killing all of us now but being that that anointing was on adam right he wasn't the fullness of the godhead bible he was part of it maybe but when jesus walked on earth he was the fullness of the godhead body he wasn't he didn't just have the holy ghost he was the holy ghost [Applause] and being the holy ghost he could come back into me and you because he said out of his own mouth he said i'm going to send back the comforter which is the holy ghost and i'll not just live with you i'm going to be in you adam couldn't do that though adam be the god of the earth though adam named every animal though adam moved to trees adam could not say eve if you die i can come back and save you no because 900 years later adam died and he went somewhere he didn't come back into this world but jesus christ died 2000 years ago folks and he came back three days later and he ain't left the sins he's the only one who can do that abraham same way abraham we'll just go through these real quick then we'll close moses brother brown said what even the bible says that the people had to veil moses's face he was so close to god you know all right you're god because you're a lot older see what the world says you just old man but you're god though but look at but look at me and you though at the uh the situation if we would have been in that situation you know listen without the holy ghost in our soul all right got it because moses didn't have the holy ghost and his soul he was anointed but that anointed man though spoke to god one day and said god if you kill them people right there you're gonna have to kill me and you know what god said god didn't say okay bye he said okay moses i'll not kill them brother brown said he threw himself in the gap just as christ threw himself now see that's moses a man but he was anointed and equipped and furnished for the job he had right and part of the job was was try to save them ignorant people and god said okay moses okay abraham i know your wife just lied to me to her face i know your wife just lied to me straight to my face but i can't kill her because that'd have to kill you showing that god will not ever kill his bride god has never killed his bride you say oh no no we don't have the second death remember we may die one time but we'll never be part of the second death because we already died here we died in christ amen that moses veil his face so close to god to when he spoke god backed it up and joshua son you need to hang on just a little while i got a battle i need to fight physical joshua couldn't do that it had to be christ because christ had to speak through joshua he was in an urgent position the prophet said he needed he knew that if that sun went down the the people he was fighting would get back together it was an urgent cry from a believer it didn't have the new birth in the soul but he had an anointing for his time amen for his administration and you know what god did god said i'll do that sun stand still right here moon don't you move in your place who could have done that joshua didn't do that christ through joshua did it same way with me and you listen you get in an urgent position you stand and say god you stopped the son for a man in the old testament so he could finish his job you stopped the moon lord do something because i need you my kids need saving amen everything just keep this just stand there like joshua david wrote all those psalms about christ and the ethiopian eunuch he was so writing about christ till the ethiopian eunuch says this man speaking of himself or is he speaking of another that was christ speaking through david but when the anointing came off of david he didn't furnish david for the job of going finding somebody else's wife that was his humanity speaking but now remember this is where it gets unbelievable we'll close right here after we get to elijah and then we'll take up next sunday remember if david he had a bunch of wives right a bunch of them bunch of wives hundreds don't know how you got anything done but the promised son could only come through it bathsheba our mind that god would use an act like that but it was to show that he's going to have his plan it's going to be just like rahab why in the world would you bring rahab in any of this a woman that had had many many many men in a city she was a prostitute yet god brought that man david through that promised jesse oh bad all the way down obed jesse boaz the type of christ i left him out boaz all came through an israeli general doing what god told him not to do yeah he married a gentile prostitute he didn't just marry a gentile woman he married a gentile prostitute we can't figure god out but i can see the redemption part in that though i can see how god saved her you and i had many husbands drinking smoking gambling yeah we were married many many times and if god hadn't done away with them you and i couldn't have christ goes remember peter paul says i give to you a chaste virgin when you receive the new birth you change back to a virgin not you went not physically see that's where the catholic church gets so close with all that changing you back but you're you're a chaste virgin you have no other husband then all your husbands should be dead that was what was happening with rahab the bible says all of jericho was killed so every one of her accusers were dead that's what jesus said to the woman when she said throw her down and say woman where's your accuser she said i have none he said well i didn't see you do it either right that's right he hears our voice through the blood yes amen and there's elijah how in the world can a man stand up and say it'll not rain until i call for it right that wasn't elijah that was christ and elijah that was christ breaking the airwaves and said they'll not even do fall on the ground now listen we've been through some droughts right we've been through droughts not three and a half years of it but what about a drought that because here in georgia i mean you get a good dew on the ground and you can survive for a little while because it's really wet but he said not even dew will touch the ground for three and a half years that wasn't elijah so what are you saying brother wade me and you are gonna have to be like those people but we got the new birth our purpose in life is is that you know why he wants us to speak right he wants us to speak it he wants us all right musicians get ready to come we'll read this one quote and we're going to stop right here i told you to be 3 30. all right let's read number three and then we'll now god seek great secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and going to achieve remember god is going to say i will and it will not come any other way and he had a motive in doing it remember brother brown talked about you he said whatever decision you make let it be the right motive and the right objective all right and he had a motive in doing it and what in order to let himself be healer savior redeemer he couldn't do it when there was nobody nobody was lost that's right in order to let him be expressed because first there wasn't even a moonstar at a molecule or anything he was god but he exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship there was nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love and him was to be father and him was to be son and him was to be savior and him was to be a healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed see we're seeing them already expressed now they were in god so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels then they worshiped him and that made him god and he started from there now that's what we're going to start with wednesday as in previous messages i've tried to explain break it down and now then when angels began to worship him that was before there was even a molecule on the earth we covered this that was the first thing created with angels lucifer and the angels there was nothing it was all darkness there wasn't no sun no moon no star no nothing he was god as he asked job where were you when i laid the foundations of the world right the sons of god shouted to go for joy the morning starts saying to the other sons god shouted for joy see now where were you see that was way back before the earth now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever began now watch and how it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living all right then you will understand clearly then you see on i believe what is being done that's why musicians come that's why we're covering this we're covering this so that we can all understand the perfect plan of redemption the eternal plan of redemption because folks you're not going to ever forget it you're going to know how you got there remember what brother branham said on that we were listening to just now he said oh he said you know old brother brown i made it when now you hear me sing an amazing grace how sweet the sound down on the curve of the river there somewhere you know he he made it pretty uh pretty clear where he was going to have his little cabin at let's stand to our feet god bless you but this eternal plan of redemption and you know what you say well brother wait it's eternal planner yeah it's an eternal plan redemption because you and i are going to continue to talk about it and continue to talk about it and continue to talk about it and continue to talk about it and continue to talk about it because it's not going to have an end we're going to get a piece of it here but if you don't get a piece of it here you want part of it back there and you sure ain't going to be a part of it that way think so [Music] praise the lord for the original life the original light the original sea the original world is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seven seals unveiled the original life the original sea listen to this we are the word made flesh today this is what the scriptures say and our names are seen within redeemed and perfect without sin yes we are anointed and inspired by our god who's the original life singer in the original life the original seed the original word is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seventh seal is unveiled the original line think about that the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the original sea the original word is what i believe the son of the man is revealed the seventh seal is unveiled the original life [Music] in [Music] [Applause] the original sea the original word is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seventh seal is unveiled the original [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] in this earth gentile days soon will be over glory hallelujah to our god whose original life the original life the original seed the original word is what i believe the son of man is [Applause] [Music] you know the world is looking for christ to come back he's already here he's already here they're going to miss that part why because their traditions [Music] has told them in the book they read that christ is coming back either on a cloud or on a horse or something eastern skies are going to split this is going to happen that's going to happen but we know one thing's for sure he's already here equipping us and getting us ready to take us there not that he's coming he's already here and that's what we look at the bible and we see that's why it says the original life the original seed the original word everything in it that what we're talking about is original [Music] the son of man is revealed in a bride because this what it's christ in human flesh called the son of man that's what jesus was jesus christ the son of man and i like that too i want you to realize one thing i hope we do something for july the 4th this year i'm putting this out here real quick because july the 4th 1971 on a sunday we had our first church service this year july the 4th 2021 falls on a sunday and it will be our 50th jubilee the golden jubilee the one that gets us out of here the golden jubilee july the 4th of this year on a sunday brother chris it just happens to be on a sunday it cycled 50 years and now it's back on sunday july the 4th 2021 who'd have thought it we thought the rapture was going to take place in july 1976 or january 1st right or 1977 but it didn't because we didn't understand what a prophet was telling us i believe since then we've unders we've understood a little more about what the prophet said i believe we are i believe we're though in the final countdown though i believe god has equipped us the finality he's equipped us to take this journey because listen folks we know this eternal redemption is eternal and we know that when we leave this redemption goes to israel and then it goes to the world and then it goes to a white throne judgment there's still redemption going on but now listen for the gentile church folks we're at the door we're like right here we're not looking we're it's right here the end of the gentile bride age is just within minutes of being over as far as god's time is just and if it was three minutes till midnight back when brother adam was here it may be just seconds but remember what i told you god said i'll come and get you but remember he'll not always strive with man he's going to be gracious and he's going to have grace and he's going to have patience but one day though that door is going to close and remember mo i mean noah did not close the door of the ark god closed the door god said that's it no more that dispensation is over you didn't listen to my preacher for 120 years this is your last day he said noah go get in the art within seven days he said i'm
