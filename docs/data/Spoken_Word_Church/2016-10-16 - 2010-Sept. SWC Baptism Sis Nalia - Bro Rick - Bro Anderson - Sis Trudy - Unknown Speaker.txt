========================================

brother how much will you ask the Lord's blessing baptism Church bless dear father thankful this afternoon just gather here this special occasion people Lord pray God word of God take hope into their hearts multiply might be a bless pray Lord that you bless each and every pray that you guide each one of us and let us be encouragement unto them Father we have three already so if anybody else decides while we're at it be glad to baptize anybody else I always like reading scripture in in Romans to kind of express the things and you know where we can put it into the scriptural part never nobody should have any problems about what we the way we do because we're going be baptized to fulfill you hear me say to fulfill what the Lord Jesus said to baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost the only way you can do that is baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but father son and Holy Ghost is not a name that's that's just titles so then it's Lord Jesus Christ see that is father son Holy Ghost so it fulfilled I like to read what Paul said in Romans here Romans 6 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein now that's what your baptism means you're dying at a water grave and you're coming back up to walk in newness of Life That's what example as far right know you not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been canted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is CR CR ified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin see that's what it means you're going to die to yourself and be raised to walk in newness now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies No More Death has no more dominion over him or in that he died he died under sin once but in that he liveth he liveth under God now what likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen that's what our what our examples are for baptism don't save you it's an answer of a good conscience in other words you're doing what God Said So we let the little girl come first being she's number one we got a little little Nala wants to be baptized anybody else that wants to be then you come on go ahead brother on Jordan stormy bank I stand and

you the reason I did it toed in9 the reason I did it because I had just come into the message and I knew we were moving to Georgia and I don't really know how I was bed I had no pre at the time I wasn't sitting under a Ministry and I wanted to know that I was bed thank you Father I baptized a lot of people over that were baptized before the only thing that I've ever made a stipulation to anybody is a lot of times and I had to baptize one if you were in a inational church that baptized under regeneration which a lot of the the Jesus name people they did do that and they would baptize under regeneration in other words believing that your baptism was your regeneration and I've always encouraged people even though they were baptized correctly to go and get make sure you're baptized because you don't want it to be under regeneration you want it to be under the truth of the word of God Amen okay amen vo would you dismiss precious Lord has been a blessed day we thank you for Souls

changing their lives and I just thank you for the word in Jesus Christ name amen
