the day I thought right that's all right that's right good to be around this time of the day hey brother Richard Robert asked my own best brother-in-law right there it wasn't funny but they were laughing okay alright Richard said it really went funny but they you know went ahead and laugh that's good everybody had a good day today so far good day so far hey I hid this thing in here today we're gonna get it from the back good look hahaha now I gotta figure out put together no I don't need no help I'm a man I don't need an airplane I don't even need a instruction manual well they put them pieces of paper in there for us we were putting something together yesterday at the bee school and I looked over to the guy and he had rattling a piece of paper I said it was the instruction I said what is that strokes the manual yeah I got all this up here now how about that see Jim didn't like for me disappearing back there in the in the back so anyway got it up here today and one fell swoop so good to be in house of Lord you got your Bibles let's turn to Book of Revelations and get started I promise you we will not be two hours today hour 45 but 2 now the last Sunday didn't seem like 2 hours did it if you really I really enjoyed it myself sometimes you know you sometimes we're just human we don't enjoy preaching dad I heard one yep yeah sometimes you don't enjoy both they sometimes that you really enter in and you really enjoy what what you bring so and it's not for us anyway it's for you guys so it's really not I mean it's not for us it's for it's for you so regardless of how we feel I always ask the Lord to give you something whether he ever speaks to me again give you something that you can take and that you can fight with because I can't fight your battles but I can help you I can help you fight your battle but I can't find your battles for you so let's turn to we go we're in part 6 now we're going to look a little bit more of justification because we're going to maybe go over some things that we were talking about last Sunday and maybe add just a little bit to it so they want to bring in one more aspect of justification because listen you can take justification that's my brother and say you can take one ceiling tile the entire Bible together you ought to solve that last Sunday you can tie it to everything you can tie that first seal to everything everything all right so we're going to try to add a little more to it today so we can see what's going on so let's turn revelation 6 verse 1 in tune let's bow our heads to hell me father we thank you today Lord for a another chance we have become in your house worship you in spirit and in truth and stand before the greatest people will ever be on the face of this earth the bride of Jesus Christ we thank you Lord now for the morning that you've give us all the singing and the playing and all the things that we've done to get ready now we pray Lord that you will be the active participant in the service you take over Lord and you do the speaking you'd be the one that does the healing you'd be the one that does the revealing because without you Lord it's just we're just meeting like a lodge but lord we know that the bride of Jesus Christ is not sitting at large the bride of Jesus Christ is sitting in a tabernacle of flesh that we have Lord the greatest message on the face of the earth and now what do we do with it Lord we bring it and we believe it we are going to manifest a body change we're going to manifest a resurrection come what may doesn't matter what these writers do or it doesn't matter what all the Devils in hell is gonna try to do you will have a church you will have a bride that will stand in the end time and say death you are destroyed Lord but it's only by the revealing of your word what you've already said so we pray Lord that you do that today just be with us be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor forgive us of our sins Lord in our many mistakes that we make against you the the things that we do that's not pleasing to you father just bless each one give us all strength we ask these things in Jesus name Amen revelation 6 verse 1 says when I saw and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts say come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer and you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word but today we're going to continue our thought on we're going to back up just a little bit if you want to bring that back up brothers and show every time we're going to show this because it'll it's going to take your take your mind to what we're talking about Redemption Redemption Redemption we are talking about the the thinking the other day I think we're going to call this the super plan of redemption because we're alive I mean the plan of redemption has been since the beginning of time amen but all those people are passed on we're alive we're actually the ones that are taking this plan of salvation and a plan of redemption and we're the ones that's taking it on a step further and we're taking it on a step further we're the alive and remain to the coming of the Lord all right so you and I are going to be the recipient of the greatest event that ever happened on the face of the earth to a group amen it happened to one man Jesus Christ but it's gonna happen to a group of people never has this ever happened never will it happen again to a Gentile dispensation so you and I are here for a purpose you and I are here that's why we come and we listen and we sit and we endure why because we're supposed to overcome I was telling the church the other day of in Minnesota you got to overcome there's an overcoming he then over cometh he that overcometh and then you get over there in Revelations when it's all finished in the cities coming down it says bless he that has overcome all things and man overcome all things so you overcome everything because you know we can overcome one thing here and something else bothers right or you can overcome one thing and that same thing they'll come back if you don't have that thing dead it is gonna come back so we look at these breaking of the seals though is Redemption Redemption is what bringing us to like what we're talkin about the other Sunday Adam was not in justification he was not in sanctification he received an impartation of the bat of the Holy Ghost and made him a son of God amen okay all right so what we're okay with that then but he did not go through justification in sanctification because remember at the time that he was given that he was not a fallen individual men I have to go through justification goes I have past sins I have to go through sanctification because I have to get cleaned up the things that I had done right ma'am I haven't didn't have to do that but in dirt but now what is that going to bring if Adam fell then we've got to get back to the condition that Adam was in restore Eden back to its original condition but it's God to take that's why these seals are so important it's not just like brother Dale said sure we read it in the Bible you can read it where this the Antichrist is to be revealed this wicked one will read it in I think I brought a portion of second Thessalonians for the mystery of Nick we don't let until he'd be taking another way you understand so he adds to be revealed but remember the whole Bible is the plan of redemption and there's only one man one man that is considered in this plan of redemption Jesus Christ only one who can justify only one who can sink to find only one that can bring a fallen people back up so I have to I have to put my faith in that man that he's not going to do it he's already done it okay he's already done so the seals then are Jesus Christ not the Antichrist so then because remember Satan is not considered in Redemption Satan's kids are not even considered in Redemption brother branham said what only the elect are considered in Redemption because remember Redemption is bringing back but now if you're just a sinner out in the world and and you never make any act of confession there's no redemption there sure there is redemption but you haven't accepted it and then that's the same thing over topic is out of court in the court Holy of Holies longer talk about in just a few minutes when you come back out even born again we remember we read those quotes brother Brown said you do things wrong it's why you got to come back out into the outer Court where everything is and go back through that now you don't go back through the same thing again you don't get the Holy Ghost and come back get the Holy Ghost again and come back you know now once you're sealed in you have the Holy Ghost and in other words this is what happened and we'll see if we can draw and for those of you that can't see this is the Ark of the Covenant so this is the outer court enter court in holy of Holy's once you get into this Holy of Holies and you're sealed in with God remember I asked like I said last Sunday you don't stay there because you're in there alone with God and yes that is a Holy Communion between you and God Almighty but how you gonna show that how you're gonna show that you've been redeemed how you gonna overcome you you don't you don't have to overcome when you're in here uh you know they always say they tied a rope to the priest to drag him out if he died if I went in there and that's your kind of glory they'd have to drag me out man I'd be so full of gone I wouldn't want to come back out they'd have to you're not being there doing this I'll be trying to you know pull them in but that's what it is now but didn't what brother Brown said he said when you get the Holy Ghost what do you wanna do you want to give it to others and that's are you so you I know the priest couldn't do that he knew that can you it was death for somebody else to go back in there but now that that's all been done away with you go behind the Holy of Holies you want to pull everybody you know in but you don't want to have a crowd in here you want to come back out and show what God's done for you that's your witness and that's your testimony that's why you said all this that's so simple listen the seals are the simplest thing in the world you just gotta walk through it remember algebra was really hard at one time well to some of you it probably still is hard but to those of us I met Deanna's teacher the other day and it was her math teacher and she said she really understands math you tell her one time and you don't have to tell her again she Bill's on that see that's the way we are with the Word of God that's what I was thinking I see if you really understand what God has already said you build on that and then the simplicity of that just carries you right on through because once you understand algebra you continue on once you understand one plus one is two two plus two is four yeah remember what I told you the other day there's only ten numbers zero through nine it's just a conglomeration or a configuration of all that and such the same thing with alphabet there's only 26 letters an alphabet and all the millions of words that we say is out of that 26 letters the alphabet so the seals then is not something and don't get me wrong it's not something that we need to set aside and say oh that's only for a that let me put this right that's only for a scholarly group of people that's only for the the the college-educated people no Peter was Peter was working through all this no not here he was working through all this and couldn't even sign his name so there's hope for all of us somebody in sign your name and it still doesn't look like anything but out of court into court and Holy of Holies everybody got that you just stay right with the simplicity of the message and you walk right through these things and it's not something that you're gonna have - yes it requires study yes it requires that you have to know what the message is but most of us have been in this message you know 20 30 even ten even five years we should be understanding that there's a baby form of justification it's like brother Dale said it you need to know you went through these and you need to know and be able to tell somebody how you went through these did you just one day show up in a message church and then said this sounds good I think up there well the devil beat you here before you got here he said that sounds good I think I can pervert that you know what he said at 29 that's the soonest the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost say you said I think I can imitate that I think I can pervert that you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna make them believe a lot did me what he done anyway done that's why today once we get through this we're going to talk a little bit about one God in that first seal because to me that's the basic foundation of all of our doctrine is that one true and living God and Jesus Christ is his name he has a name amen because most Trinitarians and most people either either our oneness or Trinity and let me add most people in the message believe in to two Lords two lords Jesus one God to the River Jordan so it was something over here anyone is though most people in the message or Tunis so you got oneness and Tunis and rhiness somewhere in there that's true oneness which is what I believe that the seals opened up when they opened up to the prophet and he saw that something happened and there was something going away from him something leaving yeah you say a prophet yeah I leaving the Prophet it was leaving him not in this soul do you understand what I'm saying so I said once you're born again once you're sealed in here you can't take that holy of holies out of you so we're safe in that aspect the man we're safe in that part of Redemption but rather quote here I'm going to read it out they don't have it but I was looking up just looking up justification where justification is absolutely a walk it's not just well I'm justified no it's a continuation sanctification is a continuation the baptism the Holy Ghost is what being born again I die daily mmm but you got to start here with this let's pull this back up and and read it again so so you've got to understand one thing like brother Dale said you put this in your hat this is this is we're not talking about your soul when we're talking about justification in the seal because it was justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost that got you into the body you can get into the body of Christ without understanding the seven seals right but you can't take a body change without understanding that part of the seal that all right so you say well why are you wasting your time where this born-again world somebody's got to come to a body change somebody's got to realize that they really didn't do it that's what we were talking about last Sunday to a degree and then a little more this Sunday but the breaking of the sails then it's not necessarily for the Soul I said not necessarily it feeds your soul because once you get in that holy of holies you want all the word you can get or you can stop like Ron will still about this morning the Holy Ghost is a gentleman you can go just as far as you want to go and you can stop all right but the breaking of the steel is not necessarily for the soul the soul is redeemed by the new birth shed blood of Jesus constant Calvary but why wouldn't you want more once you've got that once you get in that hole if I'm I mean I'm trying not to be sacrilegious but I if I was that priest I wouldn't want to come back out I'd be like brother branham going across the curtain of time why am I gonna go back out there I mean you got the Shekinah glory God is standing there in front of you in a cloud in a pillar and he's accepting listen to me he's accepting that sacrifice that I'm taking the man he's accept and I'm therefore what all of Israel I'm there for the whole nation of Israel one man walking in that holy of holies man I wouldn't want to get out of that thing for nothing cuz remember when he come out this your kind of glory didn't follow him he stayed in the holy holy amen but now you see by the blood of Jesus Christ that veil was rent remember the temple veil was rent from top to bottom so that they could see the holy of holies and now in the day of Pentecost all that to take talk about because remember the Holy of Holies consists of the Word of God the law of Moses remember was the few tablets it was inside that inside that Holy of Holies the two tablets were inside this Ark amen so the word it was the word that was there it was a word that brought its own with the words only going bring Redemption nothing else can bring Redemption and if Jesus Christ is the word of God excuse me the word made flesh you and I now are the word made flesh so we're not behind the holy of holies we're out here and we're telling people about the holy of holies I'm sure that priest tried his best to tell people about it had no clue but now since all of us that are born again it went behind there we can commune in one thing we've been to the Holy of Holies we've been before the Holy of Holies and now that Holy of Holies has disappeared inside of a group of people that Holy of Holies is not something that's a physical place you got to go to it's the Word of God and then you feed off of that but look but it will bring full fellowship in the manifestation that's what's been lost Adams fellowship with God is what separated him the curtain came down in the Garden of Eden so God said Adam I can't talk to you like I used to but I'm going to make a way because I'm going to put enmity see that was to me genesis 3:15 is one of the second greatest scriptures in the Bible Genesis 1:26 is my favorite but 3:15 and there tells how he's going to do it and there is a way back that he did not destroy Adam and Eve after they did what they did but the earth fell man fell in flesh the near fell now everything's got to come back through you and I so there had to be a message though to bring that how are we gonna get somewhere if we don't have a way back a roadmap a way to get there cuz man had probed at it Wesley Luther all the the denominations had had said well it's this way well it's this way well I brought down said and he and that's the truth think about it they're not preaching non salvation in these churches everybody has their the Methodist has a way for you to come to God it's wrong but they have a way for you to try to get to God the only thing they know the Methodists the Baptist the Catholics everybody has their billboard this is how you get saved by the Catholic Church this is how you get oh did you see the other day on the news the Pope told the world he said the United States and Russia must be governed by world government because we're getting out of control now when the Pope says that it's going to happen he says the United States and Russia even said China they're misbehaving so they must be governed by one-world government you ever heard that word one-world government I told him downstairs although that the Pope the now watch Steve we know by the message of the hour and by the Bible who is the image to the Beast which is the United States so what's he saying he said the United States needs to be governed in other words so I can go over there and get them to do what I can't do is one man I can do as a nation it's had enough people but remember when it all happens we're out of here hey man we don't get that we don't get none of that covenant stuff no and then the Pope is gonna go to Israel you know why he's gonna tell them same thing he said y'all need to be governed look at all this out the world is being governed by one-world government we need to include you and you know what they're gonna sign a treaty for seven years to see if it works there's gonna be 144,000 that's gonna protest that but you and I are gonna be in glory enjoying the glory of the Lord but we got to get through this first all right so let's go to court number one and just read a few quotes then we'll get right back on to I thought we will move all the way over into one guard but I think I'm gonna go back to this justification one more time but look revelation chapter five further Brown says see what it's doing this the seals opening up just begin to reveal the plan of redemption I don't need re anymore I've read that quote six times the plan of redemption so thank the plan of redemption when we start talking we don't like the plan of redemption whatever we're talking about we're talking about this these seals are beginning to reveal the plan of redemption all right that bow okay with that so then you started out we did with the mystery of iniquity let's go to second Thessalonians 2 verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work now remember according to what we were talking about a couple weeks ago that mystery is now history that mystery there is no mystery where Satan is there shouldn't be any mystery and I'm not talking about just history in our in our thinking and our ideas we know what the seed of Satan is what he's trying to do we know that so there's no mystery anymore that's been made known prophet of God said the mystery has been made what history all right so let's put that out of the way we don't listen the only thing that's going to deceive us is what's coming in this message the perversion of this message because everything out hey Diana my baby girls here but everything else that that's there's not a deception the deception is here how was the baddest going to Seaview house the Methodists going to deceive you but somebody's jumped in the message it may deceive you it may deceive the very if it were possible so the mystery of iniquity we gotta start shaving this off we know where the seed of Satan is we know what Satan's doing he's perverting everything God he is not an original he's perverting everything he's a wild horse rider he looks like sometimes he acts like God amen for the mystery of iniquity doth already work now that's Paul probably about twenty years after the Holy Ghost filming today at Pentecost he's writing to the Thessalonians 20 years after the pure Word of God hit the earth Paul is saying the mystery of iniquity doth already work he talks about Grievous wolves John says Antichrist goes remember he saw him over there on the Isle of Patmos and admired him remember he admired that thing to let angel shook him and said hey I'll be looking at that thing for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he God who now letteth will let until he'd the bride and I'm quilting brother branham be taken out of the way so he let he's gonna let this thing go on and you and I are gonna be taken out of the way so that this man of sin can what fully manifest yourself the Pope can't fully manifest what he's going to do with us here oh it's working I remember the Catholic Church they have like a thirty year program so they're already into the 2040s 50s almost into the 2050s with their program that they've got I hope it don't make it to let people know maybe some babies will be around but we won't but the mystery of iniquity just already worked only he who now letteth will let until he be taken away because you know what happens like the Baptist let's just take the Baptist for example because we know their doctrine once saved always say well once inside the holy Holies I agree once inside the whole once that whole Holy's is inside of you you're sealed until the day of your Redemption all right but now if you just walk up to this court and you just start feeling good right about here then you start feeling a little bit better in this second court because because you know the the waters of separation and you come in here you got the candlesticks and you get to feeling a little bit better but you're never going to holy of Holy's you're not saved a man well then see that's a mystery that has been that's my brother Branham when he gets into these seals he says now I see why I hated that thing why he hated that organization because Satan was riding right in that organization telling the people there okay what do you do you believe what they say you believe what's going on and that's what Satan wants you do because he's gonna give you so much lying lying wonders and all true you're gonna believe that God said you believe a lot and be damned by it alright now let's go to Titus 2:14 but remember the mystery of iniquity it's not something that we're you know we're out we're left out we can't get in here we're barred oh no we can't get in here who Christ gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works proverbs 16:6 how by mercy and truth why mercy by the Holy Ghost and the truth of the word collect you've got to have both of them combined mercy of God is that God filled you with the Holy Ghost and you still had problems you still had problems but you accepted what he already said by mercy and truth iniquity is purged in other words you have it to purge the line you gotta have water in it you wouldn't need to purge a water line if you didn't have water in it you're purging that water line cuz there's water in there or sewage or whatever you want to say well our case would be sewage by mercy and truth iniquity is purged all right rolling it and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil show mercy and truth by the Holy Ghost coming and giving you something to fight with and giving you a sword which is the truth of the word iniquitous / so in other words the iniquity is not this big word that we can't we can't handle you know we've come to a place to where we can even handle death now Paul did post the death where is your sting now he was lying if he what didn't say that death where's you staying grave where is your victory we have all things through Christ who strengthens us they are into justification so the mystery of iniquity to me to me the mystery of iniquity has done away with when we see that that God is not three that like brother Dale has been preaching how this all marries together the Father Son and Holy Ghost all come to you at the new birth not just a father sending the son that I just want to say that Trinitarian doctrines from the pit come from the pits of hell and man they did come from God never did never will all right put that back up there justification Strong's justification is what righteous justified and vindicated by God you can't justify yourself you can't pull you you can't pull yourself up by your own bootstraps that's a prophet said one time look and vindicated by God God will vindicate every situation that you have he'll vindicate him being there if not then you're not born again because remember he's only obligated to keep his children not somebody else's alright it's a part of God's attribute because God's attribute is what a redeemer and to be redeemed you must go through justification amen and then justification means of God as covenant keeping in Redemption God said he's going to do it and then of people enjoying salvation I enjoy justification my past sins are gone listen I I'm telling you when when brother branham told me he'd tell you when brother mom told me I don't have to go through the tribulation or I don't have to stand before the white throne judgment I am so justified I didn't do it or they would be a mark because the people that are standing at white throne judgment they have a mark they have to be judged by their own words that's why the the height of salvation the heights of justification is in these seals the height of redemption amen that Alright isaiah 53:11 he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many now he didn't say justify all justified meaning only his children man for he shall bear their iniquities so we know who you know listen we know who we know who this mystery of iniquity is but we know the guy that banished it he's my father he's my husband hey man he bore my iniquity he took my iniquity and put him in the sea of God's forgiveness acts 13 38 be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through this man it's preached unto you the forgiveness of sins who Jesus Christ and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses that's why this holy of holies had two law of Moses one man went in one man come out but the sin was still there but when Jesus Christ became the holy holy the part that come to come in you all this others you don't have to worry about so I said once you get in then that Holy of Holies like we're in the Holy of Holies the Bible says come boldly before the throne well that's where the throne was and then come boldly to the throne because you can be justified by that law that was in note that was in that arc that's why when Israel finds all this and starts putting this temple back together there's 144,000 group that's going to say he's not in there he's in here and they Israel is gonna kill them 144,000 you know I mean you guys stay single care well I mean you know even the people in the Middle East think okay listen Syria wants them all dead anyway Jordan wants them all dead anyway Iran and Iraq they want the Jews dead anyway with them Israelites they're gonna say we got this all together our messiahs coming then you go have 144,000 standing around it going he's already here and you missed it because remember they're gonna get a revelation that that man that they crucified was the Holy of Holies they man all right Romans 1 verse 16 not gonna get finished for this phone get off the rabbit trail for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ whereas the power of God unto salvation to everyone that what believeth to the Jew first and also to the great for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith at it is written as it is written the just shall live by faith you know Martin Luther's just shall live by faith didn't die it's still true today [Music] how do I live by faith if I'm not just if I don't know that somebody's made me just I couldn't live you couldn't come to church and understand God the just still has to live by faith because remember it says the just shall live by faith you got to be just first so Martin Luther in his what we call it even brother Branham I got the quote right here brother Graham called it in his weakness his weak doctrine Martin Luther's doctrine according to our doctor in this week but he put him in the body it put him in the body why was it wheat because it only put the people he's in his group and only put there just got them in a man because remember he could smoke and and drink and you know I don't think he was an evil man when we say that was the you think well he was in a pub where they played rock'n'roll music and you know no no he was a German Germans drink beer they drink beer light reads we bring water but he talked about guarding God justified Martin Luther by the faith that Martin Luther had and what God said amen so the just he was just first then he lived by faith then all right all right Louis that good you okay bless his heart didn't I know he gets you weak when you when you've been sick all week Romans 3:19 says now we know what things soever the law says it says to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in the sight for for by the law is the knowledge of sin that was here first first time tackle alright but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference but we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus now this is why I told you last Sunday will probably be brother branham cuz remember brother Brown comes out and he says okay justification it's like picking up the glass I picked up the mug out of the dirt it's still dirty it's still gommi it's got stuff all over it but it's the glass he was just in picking it up he justified that glass though it still be dirty he was going to use that glass he had a purpose for that glass all right whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past cuts off your past sins picks you up out of the mud forgives you of the mud that you were in amen doesn't think the mud off though no we thought this is baby form justification to declare I say but now we remember we got to bring it up like we did last Sunday to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of womb of him who bewitched believeth in Jesus that's me and you all right what is the boasting then is it excluded by law of works nay but by the law of faith therefore we conclude this is the whole conclusion of the whole thing we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law all right going down a little bit further seeing it is one God they brings him one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith all right we were talking about that last Sunday all right now remember Romans 8:29 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified all right so it's all done by him but remember those who is justified he's already glorified alright so you and I must see that and that we must realize that our baby form justification begins the process but it's not the end of the process it won't like said it won't even what Martin Luther preached in and set the world on fire won't even get you in the body of Christ because what the progression of God's Word the revelation that has been brought through Luther Wesley Pentecost and then into this message that it's brought us to where now it's not just that we are justified it's we if we're justified we're already glorified if we're truly justified and you know what God's one only one that knows that but I'll promise you he'll tell you somewhere because you got to know your position and to know your position you God has to tell you that brother Dale can't tell you your position brother dig myself we can't tell you your position you have to find it out and you can only get it from God so whom he is justified he's already glorified and I'm not gonna add to the word but I'm gonna say he'll tell you this he'll let you know where you're at remember brother Brown said you should know where you're at with God at any time is that right now who's gonna tell you that devil no God you only ones gonna let you know where you act all right let's go to number two that's our word now seeing that Paul was justifying Abraham by faith James justified anybody's works and he spoke of that up at the top a little bit Paul said Abraham was justified Romans four by faith and so James comes over and says that he was justified by words now both of them one confirmed the other now Paul was speaking what God saw his faith James is speaking what man saw his works they're bad guys that's a man because remember God sees all this but like I said last Sunday when you get in that Holy of Holies you've got to come back out to here to show it that's your works this is your works to god that's not knowledge to know 2+2 4 that's knowledge to know about God's Word maybe we don't been through all these that's not man's virtue or man's nice oh god that was the actual attribute of that man standing on earth every way he acted that's how you and I are supposed I Amen virtue has went forth from me temperance patience godliness to love people that don't even love you Christ got on a cross for people who didn't even love him amen that's what you and I got to be so to show our faith and to show our works we got to come back out like we were reading last Sunday we read it again let's pull up number number three why my people so cost about because brother I'm like brother down said brother around looks like he puts you in the Holy of Holies and then he brings you out well he does yeah and I want to emphasize this one more time if you get inside these holy Holies and stay there the whole Christian life is white like brother that's it living for others and how you gonna live for others shut up inside of the box you can't you got to come out oh if that priest could ever got the Holy Ghost in his soul you wouldn't had to had a rope he to pull his head down getting out to tell them finally finally it sit here not just something I gotta put in front of me so Paul is telling us how God is doing this work James is telling us that we got to come out and go and our works has got a show that's what he said before and that's in that scripture before or in that quote before now number three why my people still Pop's talked about I want you to notice another thing about this peculiar of the light the believer walks him when he's in Christ look the walk that the believer walks in when he's in Christ peculiar arity of it now the three course the justified man out here he walks by daylight some days as gloomy days you get it out here remember out here this was open if you're looking your picture out there this is open if it rains you get wet it's hot you got sunshine you know but in here it's not but remember how you going to how you going to overcome without coming back out here and bringing that that got you in here the holy bring him out here and put him on display a man to me that's what the statue of a perfect men it man is is a display of God Paul Peter comes out and said silver and gold have I none but such as I got when I was in the Holy of Holies I'm going to give it to you you get it all I hope you see this god bless you some days are glooming some days you do not know whether it's really worthwhile to serve God or not you never had those days before right you're walking in the outer Court see you're eating manna sure you are a believer sure you have eternal life sure if you die you go to heaven truly but what kind of life are you living every day you get out oh I got my dandruff up today I told him about our custom on I couldn't help it God forgive me sure he will certainly he will you're his child but what kind of life are you living let me interject a little between the lines what kind of whipping are you fixing to give because you're fixing to get a whipping a man that the children of the world they're not gonna get a whip until the white throne judgment you not get our whipping now amen what kind of life were you living my don't you hate to live that kind of life ups and downs trouble poor day and night back slidden back to church back slidden back to church this that apologize to this over here this other fellas just bloom and run along bone not a thing see you know why because he lives he takes this and brings it out here sure he's gonna have ups and downs but he's living in the light all right see what kind of a light he walking in according to the weather it gives the light outside the gloomy the foggy the halfway and a brighter day just been gloomy for two days outside but as a Christian that we supposed to let that bother us when I supposed to let that hinders were supposed to go out and and I love what brother Brett said one time you know somebody asked him a question he said now cloudy days don't mean that God's against you he said sunny days don't mean nothing for you either yeah no that's just the weather that's just what happens out there but I'm nobody in here and in here a foggy in a cloud over the Sun that's the way any regenerated justified man lives so the second form of justification that we're talking about the unclean I mean the wild horse rider leaves listen you're white if you're born again you're white that ought to settle it if you're born again you're white you're Stuart you're as white as you'll ever be you never get no more white in your soul you never will there's not little spots you're either black or white in that soul right here you're either black or white now when you come back out here you're gonna have some black days he just said that you got on some days you feel back slid back slid back to church back slid back to church but once we know what that man of sin is doing it's him that's giving you them gloomy day it's him that's giving you those foggy days it's him that's giving you that backslidden condition but look folks brother Branham said a child of God can get knocked down but the difference in a child of God and a child of the devil the child the devil stays there a child the God gets back up a man picks up the sword he might drop the sword he might lost his sword he's looking around for it but if you ever get that sword pick back up go back in the bottle number four this is when we read last Sunday now that what he had anointed prophets sexual born men but it wouldn't work no one time then God became man and Jesus was that man and he was the expressed image of the Father see in other words all this great purity of love great purity of power all this great thing was manifested in him now therefore he went down to the grave and died for us for our sanctification I love this pull it up so they can see that um brother okay he went down to the grave and died for us now remember the Bible says he rose for our justification listen Jesus Christ could have rose left and not come back he's God he do what he wanted but he didn't the reason he rose in human flesh was to come back into your human flesh look he died for us for our sanctification and justification then brings back the Holy Spirit see for us now therefore we are the justified Christ was the sanctification of God we are the justification because remember we are the ones that have sinned only Christians have seen did y'all know you let me read that quote but we're justified you got to believe that we are the justification Christ the sanctification and the father's the head now there's justification Satan kid's baptism the Holy Ghost because who comes to you at the Holy Ghost the head the head comes Christ the man like brother Bob was gone but the man comes to you not yet sure you sure you start as a baby but guards no baby when he comes inside of you you were baby because you listen you and I don't know how to handle God unless God gets inside of you hey man you won't know how to handle God you look look what you did out in the world please please just let you mind wonder for a second it's wandering now let it wander for a second of the things you did totally contrary to God and now the things that you did the things I used to do I do them no more why he justified you he what he clean went down to the Washington part yet he justified you you're just that's why you're just as righteous as God is if you're justified true justification amen done alright we went over this last Sunday but we just go down again a little bit more go down the road a little more number five Christ the mystery of God revealed I think y'all put the number on the next one but that's actually number five in the continuation of it so leave it right there look brother Branham says we stand justified in Christ before him because he cannot pass judgment for he's already judged that body now let's look at the onion peel he's talking about the body he was in Christ body that he was in but now that body doesn't need justification but his bride body needs justification a man his bride body needs justification and sanctification to keep us clean he we stand justified in Christ before him because he cannot pass judgment he's already judged that body in which I am a part of what how am i a part of it here it is it's in me pretty simple in it if if you abide in me and my words abide in you then what you say ask the Father anything in my name it'll be done because it's there justified glory to God alright continuing down oh if I could get the world to see that alright same thing oh if I could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of Christ living standing or named redeemed oh my justified in this side why are we justified where his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this last day with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory then we see him coming living down in the church that's his victory his victories me and you amen number six invisible Union this is what we got - last weekend do you mean to tell me that my old bug no look now your old book is gone with your old Union now your name and your old has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the Lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold Amen we believe that now you're not only forgiven because remember forgiven is baby form justification you forgive your past sin justification is chopped off your past then we have been through that that's baby form that's not what we're talking about in the seal and ma'am we're talking about you really see it really seeing by faith that you are sinless because remember when we get to the fifth seal in about a year or so we're gonna see a group of people that's given eternal life never wanted it right and listen neither did you God come looking for you so you say while them fish sealed you they just gonna be giving eternal life they'd say well yeah they are but so were you you were a Gentile you were out of the economy of God you were gone but God give eternal life to you so don't think it's so much that God's gonna give you eternal life to a group of people that didn't believe in him because he gave that he gave it to you you started believing that true germ took hold now you're not only forgiven but you're justified glory justified Romans five said yeah therefore being justified by faith the whole thing though this whole thing's faith amen this whole thing is built on faith look up the word the word don't mean forgiving the word means justified it don't mean you're forgiven for instance you hear I got drunk and done some evil thing and everything then you come around say to me you found out I didn't do them then you come around and say brother am i forgive you forgive me I ain't doing it to verse right now if I did it I'm guilty we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God that's what the Bible says right but you could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty that's just in that's just in our form right but yet I'm not justified because I actually done it but the word justified is though you never done it it's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book in marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of God what sins are you talking about we bring them up every day God don't remember I'd be a nervous wreck if I was God I'd be a nervous wreck what you thought about but in that the truth we keep rehashing all this stuff that God don't even don't even remember that's why we got to have faith that it's done we got to have not just baby for them just to forget I believe God chopped my past sins off I believe God give me the Holy Ghost I believe he's saying to find me but I also believe I got problems then I gotta work on in my spirit realm to connect back to my soul remember I said before you were detached from that that soul is white if you're born again that soul is as wide as it ever will be but inside that that second rim memory memory reasoning conscious affection that's not a godly love that feel you look imagination boy that will get you but that's where God works and the devil works but saying can't work in your soul if you're born again that's why we gotta realize greater is he have you ever heard that before there's a song but greater is He that's in you than his son okay if there's not somebody ought to write one if you laugh you might wake up a little bit I'm hollered as loud as I can the legs got his hearing aid I'm gonna go earplugs in I'm still blowing him away right I'm sorry man that's why stand over here don't say no blood just for you I said oh we're mark Mark's ears ring for three days but that's all right he hears me the old union is in the sea of god's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with remember we were trapped into this he the bridegroom boy your shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are the predestinated seed now continue on invisible Union you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know when we gonna start believing this it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God listen if God can bring up one thing against you one thing you're not born again one thing but when he bursts you into the body he washes all that out but by the washing in the water of the word like the water that came out of the pyramid and sister Sheppard's dream he had trash in it now sister Sheppard soul didn't have trash in it her spirit realm had trash in it because you can forget the body the body's just holding all this together okay my hand don't sin my eyes don't sin but what's inside me does what's inside me does and it comes out but we gotta also remember though we were trapped in this thing I wasn't supposed to come like this what is Redemption bringing back so we got to bring it back and we got to let God bring about you're the virtuous Bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless son of God where's the negative in this standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the Father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God called love amen so what sins are you talking about you walk him back through here heading back to get another dip not to get a not to get a new birth not to get a new new birth because you're born again amen born again right but what we're heading toward is this guy right here that's gonna seal this thing in seal it in then when this comes down guess what we've got to come right back out here we hadn't done that yet but we don't come right back out here and do the same thing always three there's three forms of justification there's three forms of sanctification and there's three forms of the baptism of the Holy Ghost are three stages that we have to go through is that all right because remember we truly get the love of God agape love in our soul when we're born again we get that love right up there but we don't know how to use it we do not know how to use it we are ignorant and unlearned because we were born with a carnal mind on this side but once he comes in though he's got to drag us up to that spot and you know what he's if he and I'm telling you yeah Jim saw a thing on Facebook the other day you remember the remember the thing it says um there was one set of footprints said that's when I carried you they said there was another sign that had some drag marks on it he's asked God says what's that he said that's when I drug you because listen if you're a child of God you gonna get drug I done told you I've been I was drugged and when I was a little kid I drove from one church to the net I judged you church every Sunday we gave me about five minutes so let's get into this and then we'll talk about one God because let's go now to Exodus 20 now we have always said that the seals and the and the the Ten Commandments were intertwined because if this is my thought whatever was in that Old Testament we get that plus we get that plus a greater understanding because remember Paul tells us I believe it's in Corinthians or maybe in Galatians he says these are all given to us for examples to whom the end of the world has come to so we've come to the very end of the world and there's really no other man am i that loud these things are going off but there's nothing else we're at the end of the book so we can turn back and we can use every resource from Adam even past Adam Genesis 1 goes back into eternity comes down to right here we can use all them for examples but remember in the New Testament those are not examples that's people with the Holy Ghost that's people with Christ in their soul but still they were looking forward to a time when a group of people it's gonna take the full revelation and God's make all these words saying I am THE LORD thy God which you have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage thou shalt have no other gods before me thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God there's that word again visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me is that all right say Amen so that's your first commandment amen so now we got a first sale was a hot white right was a white horse and we don't talk about it much but there was a man on that horse right now we said before in the law of contrast there was a white righteous church on the earth in the time that this white horse or white horse with a man on it developed his doctrine what was his doctrine to divide God into three pieces a man he took the first commandment he took the first commandment and said I'm gonna destroy it I'm gonna make it look good cuz you can't this guy didn't come out with some hideous looking something no it's beautiful the doctor was beautiful well if you deny the father you did another son you see what I'm saying so so they divided him up what is that that's not God God never wash three amen God never watch two he was 1 Deuteronomy 6:4 through five here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord Satan said if I can get them to see an image of three and still be a white righteous Church I've done my job because listen and we'll stop it right here save time and then we'll continue this is what will be startling next Sunday but to that first seal shows one true and living God because remember when brother Branham goes over to Matthew 24 what does Matthew 24 say take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many those remember that that tops your seals matthew 24:4 through what I just read four through four and five Jesus told them take heed that no man deceive you listen the biggest deception is two things Trinitarian doctrine and Father Son Holy Ghost baptism and that all developed right at the end when he was getting ready to get off this horse in that thirst third Church agent get on that other horse the next one which is read right all right white red black when he gets ready to get on that red horse he has already formulated an idol an image amen that's what the first that's what the first commandment says don't have no other God before me don't have no other Idol or image that you worship now the whole world worships the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism they embrace it kill you for it same thing with the Trinity honestly go talk to somebody go out go out and talk to somebody ask the Methodists or Baptists there no dick there and just ask them saying what is this about a Trinity and they'll give you all the way back to what grandma saying but it's a lot it's a lot of that white horse with that man riding on it it's a lie it's a bluff remember the property guard let's stand Allah come we're gonna do communion so we won't if anybody needs anything we'll pray for you but I tell you what I've seen people heal taking communion amen so to me that is a that is one of the ordinances that we we are commissioned to keep and I tell you if you keep it God will honor it but see brother Branham walks up one day and he remember he that table come up off the ground that table comes up starts floating the demons or floating tables around the room prophet of God walks and he said in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he said fall never paid him any attention why that's an idol right that's that man of sin the mystery of iniquity but when he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hit the ground that thing hit the ground baton doctor knocked the legs off of it why there's power in sin that this is the Antichrist because he's standing here one God with a book in his hand and there goes the man of sin there goes the man this give you trouble all of your life oh he doesn't I've tried to get a new alarm clock they doesn't like the devil up sometime I get up can't find one true I tell you what it did though for this sermon though the other morning I was I was tired but the the alarm went off at five o'clock we had a I mean no the alarm was gonna go off at seven I woke up at five o'clock just as wide awake and I just went you know what I let the devil started on me about this and that any other how I felt and how I did and how this wanted on I went in there and I got sermon boot devil I went in guys sermon for about two hours i sat there and I read quotes and I read the Bible and I said ain't wasting time on this one I'm gonna go ahead and get my sermon so but tomorrow I mean next Sunday we'll talk more about this one God because remember that's where everything turned in that in those first three ages when that Trinitarian doctrine came out that not was not of God now listen God winked it to ignorance of people he's going to save those who believe a man and he had children in there he had children that were about under that false baptism but remember if he justified you he didn't count it against you right amen hey man if he justified that group of people he didn't count Martin Luther's drinking and smoking against him now you better not do that call this counted against you once you get in that holy hose you won't won't ever do that again that all rights a man but we'll talk about one guard next undies for just a little while under that first seal we'll see how it ties in but you see how beautifully it is fixed it's tying in to the even to the to the Ten Commandments first seal first commandment don't have no idols don't have no graven image now how many of them we we lived under an image there wasn't it was an image to the Beast that's why I live before the gut before God saved my soul I live for that image and you know what you can call it whatever you want to call it drinking smoking gambling cussing run around pornography television whatever you wanna call it that was your Idol before you came to God amen but now look let's bring the deception a little higher bring him into church and you better get rid of that three-guard thing you better get rid of that father son Holy Ghost baptism that's why repent of all that just you've done and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive that holy of holies god bless you let's pray before we take communion dear Lord Jesus thank you for the day thank you for the time we've been given thank you for the Word of God that we've heard today Lord thank you for the people they've come to sit and listen and to hear from you father we pray that as we always say that you'll give us revelation because well without you there is none there's just an image image to a beef not that not that image you saw Lord you saw an image in Genesis 1 and it had nothing to do with Satan it had nothing to do with sin that Genesis 1:26 man stood perfect clean no problems Lord may we have faith that that same man standing here today at Genesis 1:26 man never died never fell he came to us and give us a birth inside of our soul and now we pray Lord that you'll continue to birth of birth to virtues birth that perfect love all those things that that we know that we're coming to Lord we pray that you would birth us into that forgive us of our sins Lord we're getting ready to take communion father just cleanse us we stand complete in you and justifying but we still have our Democrat old carnal mind that we got to contend with that reminds us of all the bad things that we do well father maybe we're once we run that through the filter of the word once we run that through the filter of that Holy Ghost that all just goes away sin less than our mind Lord said less than our spirit father that you'll give us revelation Lord now more than ever all the new ones coming in and the young ones man they're just they're just coming in so fast that levinthal worker is doing his job and I pray Lord that you would just give them fruit for their labor - father just be with us now Lord in this communion time and take care of us we love you we love what you've done for us but we most thing we love what you've done for your people that you've given them revelation of the Word of God just be with us now Lord take care of sin Jesus name Amen go ahead I'll get that going amen enjoy the message let's give our brothers good I believe it I believe it amen just keep your eyes and thoughts from what's taking place and then you can see truly the message of the hour reveals Jesus Christ I said on the revelation there is it's Jesus Christ because anywhere you put it even if you put it into you it's Christ in you the hope of glory so what's the revelation of Jesus Christ amen let's go into our scripture and first Corinthians 11:23 or I have received for I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me first often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but a little man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another anything a man hungrily to hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation the rest I said in order come let's just take a moment and just have a silent prayer praying one for the other and print the Lord would take care of things and all for we're going into this part and ask the Lord to make us worthy to be able to take the communion you
