[3:51] together for good to them who them that
[3:54] love God to them who are the called
[3:55] according to his purpose for whom he did
[3:58] for know he also did did predestinate to
[4:01] be conformed to the image of his son
[4:03] that he might be the firstborn among
[4:05] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[4:08] predestinate them he also called and
[4:10] whom he called them he also Justified
[4:13] and whom he justified them he also
[4:15] glorified what shall we then say to
[4:17] these things if God be for us who can be
[4:21] against us amen all right let's go to
[4:23] Genesis
[4:27] 3 and we'll begin reading with verse
[4:31] one now the serpent was more subtle than
[4:34] any beast of the field which the Lord
[4:36] God had made and he said unto the woman
[4:39] ye hath God said ye shall not eat of
[4:41] every tree of the
[4:43] garden the woman said unto the serpent
[4:46] we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of
[4:48] the garden but of the fruit of the tree
[4:50] which is in the midst of the garden God
[4:52] has said ye shall not eat of it neither
[4:55] shall you touch it lest you
[4:58] die and the serpent said unto the woman
[5:01] ye shall not surely die for God doth
[5:04] know that in the day you eat thereof
[5:06] then your eyes shall be opened and you
[5:08] shall be as Gods knowing good and
[5:11] evil and the one the woman saw that the
[5:13] tree was good for food and it was
[5:16] pleasant for the eyes and a tree to be
[5:18] desired to make one wise she took of the
[5:20] fruit thereof and did eat and gave unto
[5:23] her husband with her and he did eat and
[5:26] the eyes of them both were open and they
[5:28] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[5:31] fig leaves together and made themselves
[5:33] aprons amen you may be seated Lord had
[5:37] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[5:40] now we've
[5:42] been speaking for a while or quite a
[5:45] while now
[5:48] on how does God
[5:52] predestinate and we spent a lot of time
[5:54] covering for knowledge getting that in
[5:57] the straight way because you know see
[5:59] being that for knowledge is first and
[6:01] then by his forn knowledge he could
[6:03] predestinate so we laid those things in
[6:06] order then we went through the the uh it
[6:09] going back into the Eternal mind of God
[6:13] and and coming this away in his
[6:17] thoughts and knowing then that uh really
[6:21] predestination which means Destiny set
[6:24] beforehand it didn't come into view in
[6:28] in heaven predestination came into view
[6:32] as the were were coming down this way it
[6:36] did with Lucifer and that he knew when
[6:38] he made him that he would make the wrong
[6:40] choice all right but it mainly
[6:43] predestination determin is the destiny
[6:46] determined of mankind and Mankind was
[6:49] not into being back
[6:51] there so then when you come and bring
[6:54] mankind into being then you can start
[6:56] talking about predestination all right
[7:00] so that's what we we've been uh trying
[7:03] to speak about
[7:29] you've got to cover it by forn knowledge
[7:31] first amen sir right
[7:36] amen so then what would be a
[7:38] predestinated
[7:41] seed would it be a
[7:46] physical does it have to be those
[7:49] things and keep that in mind because
[7:51] that's what we're trying to cover now we
[7:53] spent this last Sunday afternoon talking
[7:57] about the seed of the serpent
[8:03] and how that that seed of the serpent
[8:06] was Satan trying to get Eve to reason on
[8:11] what God had said amen all
[8:16] right because the seed of the serpent
[8:18] now follow me through tonight's message
[8:21] real carefully in the way I'm bringing
[8:22] it now because you'll see what I'm
[8:24] talking about the seed of the
[8:27] serpent h
[8:30] Cain was not the seed of the serpent
[8:33] physically
[8:35] speaking physically corporately speaking
[8:37] he was the seed of the
[8:39] Beast all right but he's called seed of
[8:42] The
[8:43] Serpent and that's why that when we get
[8:46] around to it and I know people then will
[8:47] hear it on the internet now and you'll
[8:49] know where I'm
[8:51] headed all mankind then in the fall
[8:54] winds up
[8:55] being physically
[8:58] speaking
[9:00] the seed of the
[9:03] serpent because we've come both ways so
[9:06] now watch tonight as we go through the
[9:08] message the seed of the serpent is a
[9:11] spiritual condition right because the
[9:14] serpent does not have a physical
[9:17] seed to plant amen right you know when
[9:20] I'm talking about the devil the serpent
[9:23] all right but you start off with the
[9:25] seed of the serpent being spiritual now
[9:27] tonight we're going to have to take it
[9:29] bringing it from spiritual into a
[9:33] natural uh thing and then we'll still
[9:36] call it in the prophet will and the
[9:38] Bible will speak of it as the seed of
[9:40] the
[9:41] serpent because it'll wind up being that
[9:44] so now when we go through it you
[9:46] remember what we're trying to bring that
[9:48] we've got to bring first the seed of the
[9:50] serpent as the reasoning factors and
[9:54] everything to be
[9:56] perverted then we go to the physical
[9:58] part heart which would actually bring in
[10:01] the seed of the
[10:03] beast but it'll still be called a seed
[10:05] of the
[10:06] serpent because that way you go from a
[10:09] spiritual to a natural all right now
[10:11] keep that in mind don't lose me in the
[10:13] message when I start going
[10:16] through now you
[10:18] remember that Adam in his original con
[10:24] creation being part of the original
[10:28] creation
[10:30] he could not
[10:32] sin right he could not be
[10:35] tempted in that state that he was
[10:38] in so he had to be brought into another
[10:43] condition or state of being to bring in
[10:47] the physical things that we'll talk
[10:49] about later all right but just remember
[10:52] that RMA gave it to you on the flashing
[10:54] red lights of his coming paragraph 114
[10:58] Adam could not not be tempted he was in
[11:01] the original right all right now the
[11:06] original creation was what male and
[11:09] female male and female male and
[11:11] female all right the original condition
[11:15] then coming up to Adam was male and
[11:18] female in one being right but at that
[11:22] position or a situation the prophet
[11:25] would tell you
[11:26] that original creation came from
[11:29] fall the animals don't fall they're
[11:32] under the fall because of us all
[11:37] right so then the prophet says on
[11:39] marriage and divorce paragraph
[11:42] 162 I gave these Sunday so quoting them
[11:46] the original creation of God could not
[11:49] sin right so you're going to have to
[11:52] watch Adam coming into a position or a
[11:55] situation that will lower him from his
[12:00] highly
[12:01] office now watch what I'm saying listen
[12:05] very carefully just because Eve was
[12:07] taken from
[12:08] Adam that's not the
[12:12] situation right that brought about a
[12:15] condition of existence but that wouldn't
[12:18] Adam
[12:20] situation you mean she was in him and
[12:22] taken out of him and then he could fall
[12:26] no you got to remember the all
[12:32] comes through the spiritual and the
[12:34] natural to Eve then you fall back to
[12:38] Adam right that was not deceived right
[12:42] he knew exactly what he was
[12:46] doing he wasn't put into a sinful
[12:49] condition because of Eve being taken
[12:51] from
[12:53] him no that wouldn't
[12:56] work Adam in the original still couldn't
[12:59] fall
[13:01] right so what did he
[13:04] do and you'll see then why that that
[13:07] there's so much in it that the Bible
[13:09] says then Adam all die y right see he
[13:11] sold
[13:13] out amen the human
[13:16] race now to try to explain
[13:20] that is one situation don't think just
[13:25] because you have the new birth that's
[13:28] right
[13:30] that you can't do wrong right and you
[13:32] ever get that in your mind you are on
[13:35] the devil's grounds headed for a
[13:38] horrible
[13:41] pit because you've taken his lie right
[13:45] so let's get it in the right order now
[13:47] and bring it out all right see sin never
[13:52] originated on
[13:54] Earth sin originated in
[13:57] heaven
[13:59] all right then came down to
[14:02] earth and the greatest ever battle ever
[14:05] fought we were covering
[14:06] it and begin in the human
[14:11] mind paragraphs 6768
[14:16] 6970 of the greatest battle ever
[14:19] fought and when it
[14:21] did Satan meets you now here's something
[14:27] I want to explain
[14:30] and it'll help
[14:31] you if you go listen to like the
[14:34] greatest battle ever fought or any
[14:38] message you find brother brandham
[14:40] explaining something of an overall
[14:44] picture the greatest battle ever fought
[14:46] he spins and I what I'm preaching now
[14:49] just a
[14:50] background I'd invite you to read that
[14:53] message over and over and over I've done
[14:56] listening to it twice this week s on a
[14:58] deer stand yesterday listened to it my
[15:00] wife and I listened last night besides
[15:02] all the
[15:03] reading because see there's a whole lot
[15:05] more in the book where he's dealing with
[15:07] you and I to be able to conquer these
[15:10] things that the fall has brought upon us
[15:14] that's right right yes sir see the
[15:17] greatest battle ever fought is still
[15:19] going on amen amen it wasn't just with
[15:22] Eve and then that ended it no the
[15:25] greatest battle ever fought the prophet
[15:27] said is still going on right now right
[15:29] that's right and that's why I've
[15:31] constantly
[15:33] Used 2 Corinthians
[15:37] 11:3 where that we would not be deceived
[15:40] like
[15:42] Eve we now Paul's speaking to Christians
[15:47] right what do you think's putting us in
[15:49] the grave right
[15:55] amen what is taking us down
[16:00] right it's not in the basis of sin like
[16:04] sin like unbelief a lot of it there's a
[16:08] lot of that but a lot of it is the the
[16:11] people in the lack of
[16:14] understanding so you don't want to put
[16:16] it in a class of
[16:18] Sinners right you put it in the class of
[16:21] lack of
[16:23] understanding lack of knowing these
[16:25] things you know the not not knowing them
[16:29] we've had 40 something years to to come
[16:32] around to knowing it but still you know
[16:36] amen I see the
[16:39] the message as a whole and I'm talking
[16:43] about what I
[16:44] know as being to worse or shape than it
[16:48] was in the late 60s and early 70s amen
[16:52] at least people had a
[16:55] desire a
[16:57] drive uh
[16:59] uh wanting to go
[17:01] forward but you see it now is
[17:04] just dropping down just all right and
[17:09] see sight and time wouldn't that what
[17:11] the prophet saiden God's two worst
[17:15] enemies s and time is let thing go let
[17:19] it go for a
[17:22] while and you just become
[17:24] relaxed become at as at
[17:27] ease and not
[17:29] as not as
[17:32] uh and I don't use the word dedicated as
[17:35] to the point of of not going to church
[17:38] and
[17:39] doing I'm talking about what is our
[17:41] desire in our hearts that's
[17:44] right we talk of a Rapture that we wish
[17:47] would take
[17:48] place I was asked the other day to look
[17:51] up some things where the Prophet had
[17:53] said something one time about somebody
[17:55] said it now I've never read it I don't
[17:56] know but said that they had a place up
[17:59] in Alaska for us to be sent to you know
[18:04] well you know it might be a good thing
[18:07] to send us all there right that's right
[18:11] right it might change things a lot y the
[18:14] prophet did say the church does better
[18:16] what under persecution amen we're not
[18:20] looking for no tribulation no no we
[18:23] could every one be sent to Alaska and go
[18:25] up to Rapture from there that ain't got
[18:28] nothing to to do with it but that's
[18:30] where the reasoning factors of mankind
[18:32] has got in it and the worst thing today
[18:35] is you know and this is a point I've
[18:37] been trying to past a couple of
[18:40] messages is we reason about
[18:44] things you know and we we're we're
[18:47] taking instead of it being the word
[18:52] says we're trying to reason that
[18:56] out and when you do
[19:00] you can get in a trap with the devil
[19:02] just like Eve was all
[19:05] right see you might wonder why would I
[19:08] spend so much time trying to express
[19:12] something to you but you know it hasn't
[19:15] been no accident that all of these
[19:17] visitors has been
[19:21] coming you
[19:23] know to where I'd have to back up amen
[19:27] right well you didn't have to back up
[19:29] for
[19:30] me that's about right cuz some of you
[19:32] wouldn't he to back up you
[19:35] know all right that's just the
[19:39] truth but you see you get offended at me
[19:42] for telling you the
[19:45] truth what would it been 40 years
[19:49] ago well brother Dale you're just not
[19:53] like me CU yeah I'm 73 I'm like some of
[19:57] you
[19:59] but you know my desire has never been
[20:01] but one
[20:03] thing move on Amen in the word
[20:08] right move
[20:11] on
[20:12] why the prophet said with the
[20:14] restoration of the
[20:17] word comes a restoration of power amen
[20:21] now did he mean that with the
[20:22] restoration of the
[20:26] computers all though that's a part of it
[20:29] and a wonderful thing
[20:32] amen the ability to get the message when
[20:34] we used to scrs to try to get one
[20:40] book see we would go to Jeffersonville
[20:43] just to get a
[20:45] book you
[20:48] know but do we value those books and
[20:51] things
[20:52] now like we did to begin
[20:56] with that's the point amen CU you see
[20:59] with the restoration of the word will
[21:01] come the restoration of
[21:04] power and I spent a lot of time past
[21:07] couple of
[21:09] messages talking
[21:11] about where brother brandham and his
[21:13] early Ministry would say
[21:15] Body Soul
[21:20] spirit and in his last part of his
[21:22] ministry would say Body Spirit and
[21:27] soul
[21:29] and in doing that I've tried to get you
[21:31] to remember one
[21:32] thing no matter what he called the
[21:36] position or placing or whatever you want
[21:38] to call it he always gave the body five
[21:42] senses see taste feel smelling here he
[21:46] always gave the second realm of mankind
[21:50] memory reason conscience affections he
[21:53] always gave the third real of man one
[21:57] sense either Faith or
[21:59] doubt just go see what he's talking
[22:02] about in the
[22:03] senses amen and you'll see what he's
[22:06] talking about you said well he never
[22:08] corrected that he didn't have to right
[22:14] right but I'll say it this
[22:17] way maybe that's God's way of blinding
[22:20] the eyes of people now I do not believe
[22:25] that brother random could blind
[22:26] anybody's eyes and be
[22:30] right I don't believe
[22:33] that I know the quotes where he said
[22:36] there's too many following this message
[22:37] and he preached serpent seed did he
[22:39] preach serpent seed to drive them off
[22:40] the M no he knew when he preached it he
[22:42] drive them
[22:45] away he knew that that when he spoke and
[22:49] nailed it down that it would drive
[22:50] people away he gets over to the seal
[22:52] book and he gets to the seventh seal he
[22:54] said this will drive thousands of my
[22:55] friends away from me but did he do
[22:58] something wrong to drive him away or did
[23:00] he preach the
[23:03] truth amen see I know preaching the
[23:05] truth is drove my a lot of people that
[23:07] were my friends away from
[23:10] me that I used to be the number one guy
[23:15] that everybody called and wanted to know
[23:18] what the prophet
[23:21] taught but you
[23:25] see the truth will drive you to a place
[23:28] to walk
[23:32] alone all
[23:35] right but you see I've tried my best to
[23:37] get you to just look at
[23:39] things we went through the Daniel 70
[23:42] week series looking at what the prophet
[23:44] had said taking everything he said and
[23:47] see how perfect it come out but how many
[23:49] people wants
[23:50] it no but it's like I said the other day
[23:54] they
[23:56] say I I don't believe what you believe
[24:00] but I don't know how to explain it or to
[24:03] tell you how wrong you are now how do
[24:06] you know I'm wrong right yeah I
[24:11] mean well I just know you're wrong well
[24:17] how that's I'm stubborn but that's
[24:21] stupidity that's right all right but now
[24:25] listen to just think about what we're
[24:28] talking about
[24:29] tonight to just think about that body
[24:33] Spirit soul body Soul Spirit just get
[24:36] the senses in the correct order right
[24:39] and when you read your Bible go read it
[24:41] I'm ask you
[24:43] to study the word spirit in the Bible
[24:46] and see it even take your strong
[24:48] concordance to get to definition even
[24:50] take your your uh emphatic diglot your
[24:54] your uh the ones to to bringing it down
[24:57] take it and use the word spirit and see
[24:59] if there's any difference between the
[25:01] spirit of man and the spirit of God As
[25:03] far as the definition of the
[25:07] word look at the word
[25:12] Soul it says there one time that all the
[25:15] souls in the
[25:17] sea well there must be people living out
[25:19] in the
[25:23] sea the word Soul comes from life right
[25:28] and can be used and I'm quoting from the
[25:30] definition of it it can be used as
[25:33] animalistic
[25:37] life if you want to use the word
[25:41] Soul all right go look it
[25:44] up it means
[25:47] life but now when you read in the Bible
[25:49] and Jesus said my soul is
[25:53] troubled was that just
[25:55] life no you know what's right you
[25:59] remember the prophet saying that our
[26:01] English language was so hard to keep
[26:06] straight and you remember the definition
[26:08] I gave to you of what I
[26:12] think see when you say
[26:14] Bor you know plank board
[26:19] board you say well our definition of
[26:22] that can be a lot of things that's
[26:26] right cuz we can say come on
[26:29] board stand on the board cuz I'm bored
[26:32] with you all that spell the
[26:36] same but I just gave you the
[26:40] definition of what I'm
[26:42] meaning read the before and the
[26:45] after and you'll get the understanding
[26:48] of what's being said
[26:51] right Jesus was hanging on the cross
[26:54] when he said into thy hands I commend my
[26:56] spirit
[26:58] that shouldn't be no problem of
[26:59] understanding what was fixing to take
[27:00] place
[27:06] right see that's what I'm trying to get
[27:08] you to do is read for
[27:12] yourself and let the Holy
[27:15] Spirit give you the right answer because
[27:18] of the situation you're talking about as
[27:21] I said I could say come on board stand
[27:25] on this board pay your board cuz I'm
[27:28] bored with
[27:29] you well there's nothing no problem with
[27:32] anybody what I say it is
[27:35] it I used the same word three four times
[27:38] there there's no problem with what I
[27:41] said see that's the way I see the
[27:44] message amen we read it and instead of
[27:48] trying to get the context or the
[27:52] thought of what's being said we just
[27:55] read it y
[28:00] well that that won't give you
[28:02] anything that this Mass confusion to
[28:06] us but now think about it this is what
[28:09] we saying what we talked about
[28:12] Sunday we talked about the seed of the
[28:16] serpent all right and how that that seed
[28:19] of the serpent
[28:21] was the reasoning factors of the
[28:25] devil trying to reason with
[28:29] Eve and that's still going on right here
[28:32] tonight today
[28:37] amen see the body of Cain never came
[28:43] from the
[28:46] devil no it came from the
[28:49] Beast
[28:51] right but see then that way just don't
[28:53] forget when we start going through it uh
[28:56] there's a quote somewhere I've got it
[28:58] laid on the desk but brother R says you
[29:00] think that the the seed of the serpent
[29:01] is just
[29:02] spiritual I forgot to bring that and had
[29:04] lay on the death he said
[29:06] no it's
[29:10] literal cuz he says every nation in the
[29:15] world he said the seed of the serpent
[29:17] has went into every nation of the world
[29:20] and said every nation of the world is
[29:23] controlled by the seed of The Serpent
[29:25] and you know what he's talking about
[29:26] physical
[29:28] people
[29:30] right so I don't lose me tonight if I'm
[29:33] going through and I I don't backward and
[29:35] for it I try to do that to keep it lined
[29:38] up you know that if I'm going from
[29:40] natural to spiritual I try to tell you
[29:43] or vice
[29:45] versa but just remember the seed of the
[29:48] serpent was first e reasoning factors
[29:53] working through the devil talking to
[29:56] her the literal part came later no
[30:00] telling how
[30:01] long before it came into
[30:04] being all right he said well we know
[30:06] these things that's
[30:08] good but sometimes we need visitors
[30:11] where we can go back
[30:14] over remember
[30:18] now 2 Corinthians
[30:21] 11:3 but I fear lest by any
[30:24] means as the serpent begil Eve through
[30:29] his
[30:33] subtility so your mind should be
[30:36] corrupted from the
[30:39] Simplicity that is in
[30:41] Christ can I say it this way that our
[30:45] minds would become corrupted from the
[30:47] Simplicity that is in the revealed word
[30:51] or the word of
[30:54] God is that all right
[30:57] because see that's what he's saying
[30:59] right Christ the revealed word amen what
[31:03] happened to the church back
[31:07] there come on what happened to the
[31:09] church back
[31:12] there I know they tried to change the
[31:14] wording in the seal book later to make
[31:16] it work out but it won't it won't do it
[31:19] even my brother tried to change mine and
[31:20] I told him leave it alone but he went
[31:21] ahead and changed it on my computer and
[31:24] I said don't don't do it you know that
[31:26] brother brandham says and I know I said
[31:29] this here
[31:31] and couple of Brothers differed with me
[31:33] about
[31:34] it that's all
[31:37] right I still believe that that early
[31:41] church under the line l i o
[31:45] n Ministry of Jesus Christ went to
[31:51] NAA because the first four
[31:55] ages was the complete
[31:58] word that's your Prophet now right amen
[32:02] all right see they went to n yeah with
[32:05] the intentions of trying to
[32:09] help oh yeah that's
[32:13] fine but the prophet said they shouldn't
[32:15] have never went down there amen they not
[32:19] have went down there why because it
[32:22] already getting the false doctrines in
[32:24] into amen right and they came out of
[32:27] there with those ideas in their mind
[32:28] remember I told you 325 ad they was not
[32:32] arguing over one God or three read it
[32:35] they was arguing over whether Jesus was
[32:38] God or a like
[32:40] substance the first Nan Creed declared
[32:43] that he was the substance of God read it
[32:46] in your go home and run in Nan
[32:49] Creed but then he had done laid that
[32:52] word into the minds of the people and
[32:55] they took it home with them
[32:59] the church went into the ground
[33:02] right under the line ministry that's
[33:06] right you know what I mean line line the
[33:07] ox man the eagle remember the combat
[33:09] beast and things that's right amen and
[33:12] they wanted to change it and call it
[33:16] lying lying spirit I told him I said
[33:19] leave mind
[33:21] alone cuz that's that's line that's the
[33:24] ministry there's
[33:25] under so somebody lied to him but the
[33:28] lying didn't lie to
[33:31] him they took somebody else's
[33:34] lie the line was the ministry of Jesus
[33:36] Christ all
[33:39] right so see then it's so
[33:43] easily that the same situation is
[33:46] existing as I said Paul is
[33:50] saying through his
[33:52] subtility like he did
[33:54] Eve he wasn't talking about physical
[33:57] adulterous
[33:59] acts he was talking to Born Again
[34:01] Christians
[34:04] right that were
[34:06] listening to the
[34:09] devil and
[34:11] now let me emphasize that a
[34:17] little when
[34:19] uh when brother Randon said that the
[34:21] white horse rider was a holy
[34:25] spirit right
[34:27] he taught that in his early ministry
[34:29] right before the seals broke white horse
[34:31] rider was holy
[34:35] spirit all
[34:37] right but then when the seal broke he's
[34:39] seen it was the
[34:41] Antichrist all right now suppose you
[34:45] only had the
[34:49] tapes of up until 62 or
[34:53] something and you're preaching to your
[34:55] people that the white horse rider is the
[34:58] holy
[35:01] spirit oh bless God let me in I'll bust
[35:04] that up you know well let me
[35:09] go you know that in the book of Acts I
[35:12] believe it's 19 I think when Paul goes
[35:15] over to the people you
[35:18] know and they were teaching that Jesus
[35:20] was the Christ you
[35:22] remember coming from the baptism of John
[35:26] the producing of
[35:29] Christ Paul didn't I tell you what y
[35:32] bunch of
[35:35] heathen Paul simply said let me tell you
[35:38] a little something because there's been
[35:40] further advancement since
[35:42] then and we have more
[35:44] clarity and said that was a day your
[35:46] people are fine you're wonderful you
[35:49] existed under that you're believing that
[35:51] Christ is right I said now let's go a
[35:55] little further right
[35:57] he's already died John's dead now
[36:01] too and said the Holy Ghost has come
[36:04] back do you get what I
[36:08] mean some
[36:10] people they don't understand this
[36:12] message because that they're hindered by
[36:15] the preachers that preach to them
[36:17] am because they don't have the ability
[36:19] to receive
[36:21] it when I went to the Philippines I I
[36:24] told you I said you just cry when you go
[36:26] and those Brothers had had begin to get
[36:29] an ability to argue about the the two
[36:32] Soul
[36:33] Doctrine because somebody had sent them
[36:35] a bunch of
[36:36] books well you know what before then
[36:39] they could just you could just quote
[36:41] brother R said so and said what are you
[36:42] going to
[36:44] say you know what are you going to say
[36:48] right but you see church we don't have
[36:50] that reason here
[36:52] to say that we haven't had the ability
[36:55] to at least receive receive the
[36:58] message and we've tried to to you know
[37:02] bring it to the clarity and get us into
[37:04] the place of understanding
[37:07] amen but get us to a place of like what
[37:09] I said we're doing
[37:11] tonight I can say see to The
[37:15] Serpent and I can be talking about Eve
[37:19] and talking to the serpent the snake but
[37:23] yet the devil inside of that snake was
[37:26] getting H to reason right you know that
[37:29] Beast it was know
[37:32] right that's right then I can say but
[37:36] you know what other things
[37:38] happened and it's the seed of the
[37:42] serpent cuz see there's only two seeds
[37:45] amen the seed of God and the seed of the
[37:47] serpent amen
[37:50] right I won't have enough time tonight
[37:52] and I won't get to it Sunday so we give
[37:54] you a little time to think you know that
[37:56] brother talks about the two trees and he
[37:58] calls Eve the
[37:59] tree
[38:01] amen but he you better read him real
[38:04] careful I can give you a direct
[38:07] quote that
[38:11] Eve would be the
[38:14] seed of a tree of knowledge of Good and
[38:20] Evil let me recorrect that that Eve
[38:24] would be the wrong tree
[38:27] and said man was the right
[38:32] tree you believe I can give that
[38:34] quote but you know what he ain't talking
[38:38] about you come on he ain't talking about
[38:42] no man like me and you he's talking
[38:44] about the man Christ Jesus that's
[38:48] right you can say well I got a quote the
[38:51] man was that other tree look at that
[38:53] he's tree of life and she's tree of
[38:55] death that's send the message
[38:58] sure people
[39:02] y you see brother randam never called
[39:04] The Man a physical man
[39:08] Adam he always called the man that I can
[39:11] find as to be
[39:15] Christ because those two trees are still
[39:18] here
[39:20] right
[39:22] right but think about it
[39:24] now through the simp licity of the
[39:27] revealed word even with the day and the
[39:29] hour that we have the ability to
[39:33] search what does the prophet say we have
[39:35] the ability to search
[39:40] it but yet where is the reality of of
[39:45] Truth you know where does it
[39:48] dwell let us start cuz I've had these
[39:51] and I give them and Highway give them or
[39:53] whatever let's read a little bit from
[39:56] the greatest battle ever fought and just
[39:58] listen to the prophet show you what
[40:00] happened to
[40:02] Eve all right but
[40:07] remember he's talking about what's
[40:10] happening to you and I right now we're
[40:14] going to read
[40:16] it is still taking
[40:18] place it didn't end with Eve and the
[40:21] whole thing's over with oh bless God we
[40:22] don't have no trouble no it's got worse
[40:25] amen the devil is more deceiving today
[40:28] what is it the scripture where talking
[40:30] about uh in the the children of
[40:35] Disobedience brother BR said look how
[40:37] deceiving it was in a child he said what
[40:39] about when it's in a man right right
[40:43] right so you and I are facing
[40:46] Satan with everything that he's got to
[40:49] pour on to us amen that's right quoting
[40:51] the message to
[40:55] us yep but somebody's going to overcome
[40:58] it am look what he
[41:01] says
[41:03] explaining what happened to
[41:06] Eve and remember he said draw you out
[41:09] three
[41:12] circles he said the outer real is see
[41:16] taste feel smelling
[41:17] ear second real is memory reason
[41:21] conscious
[41:22] affections all of that you
[41:25] know let third real is either one fa one
[41:28] thing Faith or doubt it's not faith and
[41:30] doubt cuz that's a two Soul doctrine
[41:33] that the devil was in your soul God was
[41:35] in your soul your soul was already
[41:37] Eternal but the devil is there you had
[41:39] to drive the devil out I said you don't
[41:42] have to do that is hit the man in the
[41:44] head you see that's being smart elic
[41:47] it's a
[41:49] truth
[41:52] right why worry about salvation and just
[41:55] hit him in the
[41:57] head they're going to kill Old
[42:01] Devil he said yeah but you don't make it
[42:04] you know that's what inter terance was
[42:06] talking about the other day and he said
[42:09] I don't understand how come
[42:12] anybody could believe that you come with
[42:14] eternal life when Jesus Christ had to
[42:17] die right now I don't understand that
[42:20] that's just plain language Ain it he had
[42:22] to die to give us eternal
[42:25] life that's just plain simple you know
[42:28] it takes away a lot of the problem then
[42:30] somebody just preach all they want to
[42:32] and you just sitting there saying run on
[42:34] I'll catch up we in a little bit I've
[42:36] enjoyed so far but I'll catch that we
[42:38] after a while cuz I don't agree with
[42:40] that right like one brother came here
[42:42] one night he was just preaching
[42:45] away and all at once he hit something
[42:48] and when he did everybody in the
[42:49] building just
[42:52] went we got down to the house he
[42:55] said
[42:57] y'all was really with me up so far said
[43:00] when I brought out so and so said
[43:02] everybody said I said yeah we don't
[43:03] believe it I said we don't believe that
[43:07] he said I thought everybody believed
[43:08] that I said well you know we
[43:11] don't amen so you
[43:14] know why you shall know the truth right
[43:17] amen and the truth shall set you free
[43:20] amen all right let's talk about Eve now
[43:24] but remember we're talking about us
[43:27] that's right right amen this is taken
[43:31] from paragraph 62 I mean paragra 109
[43:34] starting there 110 of the greatest
[43:36] battle ever
[43:37] fought preached in 62
[43:40] 311 your conscious has even gone to
[43:44] that and that's not talking about Eve is
[43:49] it you see what I'm telling you don't
[43:52] listen to the greatest battle ever
[43:53] fought or read it to just find out what
[43:55] happened happened to
[43:58] Eve yeah you got a lot in there what's
[44:01] happening to you and I what's he saying
[44:05] your M your conscience is even gone to
[44:10] that why CU brother R said he said if we
[44:14] can get this this little thing fixed he
[44:16] said there won't be a sick person in
[44:18] this building or a person seeking the
[44:21] Holy Ghost in five minutes he said if we
[44:23] can get it fixed you know what and never
[44:26] got it fixed
[44:29] right
[44:33] right so where are we at your conscience
[44:36] has even gone to that the flu is so
[44:38] clean it shouts
[44:41] Hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle
[44:43] glory to God it shines out certainly
[44:47] just is clear Clean and Clear for the
[44:50] word of God to work through the power of
[44:52] God see and that's the main thing right
[44:55] so there's nothing wrong with see taste
[44:57] feel smell and
[44:59] hear if it stays on faith do you want
[45:02] that it's in this message there's
[45:04] nothing wrong with memory reason
[45:05] conscious affection and love or whatever
[45:08] the five you want to
[45:10] name as long as it's with God's word
[45:14] amen that's part of our doing that's
[45:16] what he's working through he's got to
[45:19] work through the same factors that Satan
[45:23] Works
[45:24] through to take us
[45:28] down right all
[45:31] right he said there's your background a
[45:34] Battleground your Battleground is back
[45:36] here at the beginning back here in the
[45:39] soul now watch him oh but that's in the
[45:42] soul back in your mind it opens to the
[45:46] mind is the gate to the soul watch him
[45:49] the gate to the spirit rather that's
[45:52] exactly
[45:54] right your mind open opens up and
[45:56] accepts the
[45:58] spirit or it rejects the
[46:02] spirit your
[46:05] mind brain do you need that quote from
[46:08] back what he says your mind is your
[46:10] brain your brain opens up to accept the
[46:13] Holy Spirit or to reject the Holy
[46:16] Spirit your brain does Satan Works
[46:19] through our brain God works through our
[46:23] brain no God just Pours Down in my
[46:27] soul now the Bible says faith comes by
[46:32] hearing all
[46:35] right now watch you can have little
[46:39] consciences little feelings little
[46:41] Sensations and all these things that has
[46:44] nothing to do with
[46:46] it that's just a little Sensations and
[46:48] things but when it comes to reality your
[46:52] mind opens it up your mind either
[46:56] accepts it or rejects it that's it
[46:59] friend he said God let none of them miss
[47:03] it see it's your mind that opens up the
[47:05] door or closes the door and listens to
[47:08] your
[47:10] conscience now you're inside coming back
[47:12] out right mind brain out
[47:18] here God trying to get
[47:21] in but there something got to work
[47:23] coming
[47:24] out
[47:26] right the
[47:29] channels it's your mind that opens up
[47:31] the door or closes the door and it
[47:33] listens to your conscience where's that
[47:35] second rim or do you want to call it
[47:38] Soul or you want to call it Spirit
[47:40] listens to your affections second real
[47:44] but when your mind closes itself to
[47:46] these things and let God the spirit of
[47:48] his word come
[47:50] in what it blows the rest of the stuff
[47:54] out
[47:58] now when we let the spirit of God come
[48:02] in the spirit of his
[48:05] word the revealed word is the only thing
[48:08] that drives out
[48:10] unbelief the letter of the word don't
[48:12] drive out unbelief right
[48:15] no come on the revealed word drives out
[48:18] unbelief okay and what blows the rest of
[48:22] the stuff out every doubt is gone every
[48:24] fear is gone ever since ation of Doubt
[48:26] is gone every feeling is gone there's
[48:29] nothing standing there but the word of
[48:30] God and Satan cannot battle against
[48:34] that you remember
[48:36] Jesus get behind me S
[48:39] right no sir he cannot battle against it
[48:43] now he knows that's true what about the
[48:46] devil knowing what's
[48:48] truth so these battles has raged since
[48:51] the day of the Garden of Eden the battle
[48:54] in the human mind
[48:56] Satan started it what did he do when he
[48:59] met Eve he didn't deny God's word he
[49:03] white wased
[49:04] it right he stopped up some little
[49:07] channels here
[49:10] somewhere okay he said but surely go
[49:14] Genesis 3:1 surely God all these things
[49:18] that that he he
[49:19] promised he know the word was right but
[49:22] he know he could he couldn't just come
[49:25] right after and blast it out blur it
[49:27] like that but he he he sugarcoated it
[49:31] remember what I was bringing out Sunday
[49:33] afternoon I hope you recorded that
[49:36] one the devil wasn't trying to tell Eve
[49:39] who he was oh no that's
[49:43] right uh-uh
[49:46] no he was trying to tell her who she
[49:49] was that's what got
[49:54] her t
[49:56] tantalizing
[50:01] information
[50:03] right smooth
[50:10] talking I've seen old
[50:13] boys and I don't mean this wrong now so
[50:15] I always get in trouble saying what I
[50:17] mean so just go ahead I've seen old boys
[50:20] Sugar talk big old fat
[50:23] girls see them do it to a lot of others
[50:25] too
[50:27] but you know what they got them in just
[50:29] a little bit they just what is what
[50:32] they're the they're the tops
[50:35] man no still a fat
[50:38] girl you say you shouldn't say those why
[50:41] not it's
[50:46] true but you know if he can do it with
[50:48] the fat on what he can do with the
[50:49] skinny
[50:51] ones it's the same thing sugar Co
[50:56] it like I
[50:58] said guys at work every day they don't
[51:02] come in stinking like a
[51:06] horse women at work don't come in
[51:09] stinking like everything
[51:11] else but then they get together and they
[51:14] pour out their petty little things you
[51:16] know my husband's not good to
[51:21] me well he ought to be as pretty as you
[51:25] are
[51:25] a beautiful girl like you your husband
[51:28] ought to be happy to have somebody like
[51:35] you now don't tell me you don't know
[51:38] about
[51:41] flattery flattery will get you by where
[51:43] you want to go absolutely right
[51:49] amen but you see
[51:51] church we don't want to think about
[51:53] those things do we no we want to get on
[51:54] to something else okay let's go ahead
[51:57] then look at look at paragraph 115
[52:00] number two
[52:08] brother the battle rised when Eve opened
[52:11] up her mind to listen to her reasonings
[52:14] that's the flu it come in now what real
[52:17] is he talking about
[52:20] reasonings second real whether he called
[52:22] it Soul or whether he calls it spirit
[52:25] second real I keep saying that over and
[52:28] over because I know the human mind and
[52:32] how it
[52:33] slips you know especially when you go to
[52:36] sleep and wake up and can't figure out
[52:37] what somebody talking
[52:40] about that's the channel that run down
[52:42] her reasoning she in her soul she
[52:46] reasoned she in her second real she
[52:49] reasoned
[52:53] right her eyes
[52:56] was s she saw the serpent he was
[52:59] beautiful handsome far better than her
[53:02] own husband he was the most subtle of
[53:04] all the Beast of the field and it was
[53:07] probably a fair man than her husband he
[53:09] looked like a great masculine Beast
[53:11] standing there how great he was and he
[53:14] was trying to tell her what a great
[53:17] thing it was and first thing she did she
[53:21] opened up her mind and when she did
[53:24] human
[53:25] reasonings caught it why wouldn't that
[53:28] be a thrill that's the same thing he
[53:31] does to a woman today some woman with a
[53:34] lovely little husband finds some great
[53:36] big masculine
[53:39] man this man will try to open up the
[53:42] reasons remember that's Satan that's a
[53:45] devil or vice versa man to woman right
[53:48] woman to man either way what does it do
[53:51] working that reasoning power the
[53:54] conscience are something begins to move
[53:58] through that's why a lot of you don't
[54:01] like the way that our hammer it but you
[54:04] are just born again in your soul you're
[54:07] not born again in your body and spirit
[54:10] your body and spirit is only under
[54:13] subjection to the soul but remember it's
[54:16] under subjection to the guy that's
[54:18] coming in from the outside also
[54:21] right now you don't like that no
[54:25] but you tell me if that ain't right
[54:28] right
[54:30] right when you get into the reasoning
[54:32] memory conscience
[54:34] Etc of
[54:38] mankind you're going to reason it
[54:41] out and you're going to
[54:43] reason against
[54:46] truth all
[54:48] right let's go ahead and look at number
[54:50] three the contest 1962 1231 paragraphs
[54:55] 16-
[54:57] 18 now Eve be to stop to reason and when
[55:01] he quoted the word she quoted the word
[55:03] to him God said you should not eat
[55:07] thereof for the day you eat thereof that
[55:09] day you we die and Satan never disagreed
[55:12] with her he said certainly that's right
[55:16] but he said you see you need some new
[55:20] light something a little different from
[55:23] what God Said
[55:30] why is
[55:31] it that you always see these young ones
[55:33] come in the message preachers and they
[55:36] come out with these new doctrines and
[55:37] everybody runs after
[55:40] them new
[55:44] light
[55:49] right something a little
[55:52] different from what God Said you know I
[55:55] think brother Rand should have said
[55:57] this or already have said
[56:00] that
[56:03] right and if you do do it you'll be just
[56:07] a little smarter your eyes will be
[56:09] opened but she said well God said we
[56:12] would
[56:13] die he said oh surely see there you come
[56:17] just that much surely you won't
[56:22] die but God said you would and that
[56:27] settles it and that that broke the great
[56:30] tug of war then and pulled the whole
[56:34] human race into
[56:36] death because Eve listened to a Reas a
[56:39] reasoning against God's work that's a
[56:42] shame that she did it but it's done ped
[56:45] but now we're still
[56:48] fortified amen and that link was made up
[56:52] in Christ Jesus we know that G God gave
[56:55] us our best
[56:57] defense just simply to trust his
[57:01] word that's just too simple though is
[57:04] it 40 something Years brother Dale you
[57:06] just been preaching the same old message
[57:08] and you ain't run after these two Lords
[57:10] Two Souls seventh under vir brues all of
[57:12] the no I didn't
[57:14] why because something told me it wasn't
[57:19] right
[57:20] amen well who do you think you are I'm
[57:23] me who Do You Think You Are
[57:25] what does that
[57:26] solve that's
[57:30] right you see
[57:32] Church you can't say that I've been off
[57:35] the
[57:38] message you might not agree with my
[57:42] Approach and honestly speaking sometimes
[57:45] I probably don't agree
[57:46] myself but I try my best to stay with
[57:49] what the prophet is talk amen and put it
[57:51] in the
[57:53] Bible to where that is it's anchored
[57:56] there all right look what Eve done the
[58:00] way of a true
[58:01] Prophet
[58:03] 6319 paragraph 173 176
[58:07] 177 and Eve let down the bars she began
[58:11] to
[58:12] reason Satan said like this now year you
[58:16] don't know you haven't had any schooling
[58:20] yet I'm the professor of the Seminary
[58:23] out here his own
[58:25] and I tell you we've learned some things
[58:27] out
[58:28] there we've learned that God is good we
[58:32] learned in our Seminary that God is so
[58:34] good he don't expect you to do all he
[58:36] wrote there he doesn't expect
[58:40] that now that's what the devil is
[58:43] telling
[58:44] Eve but is that what he's telling us now
[58:48] she made a good preacher watch oh yeah
[58:51] but she said the Lord God said now she'd
[58:55] have made a good preacher if she'd have
[58:57] stayed on that if she'd have stayed with
[58:59] what God Said but that's why he put her
[59:01] out wouldn't let her preach right keep
[59:04] her away from it all
[59:06] right but you say with brother
[59:10] Dale what I don't like about you and
[59:14] what I don't like about the preachers in
[59:15] this
[59:19] message is you won't you tell us that we
[59:21] have no right to
[59:23] think
[59:27] well I didn't tell you
[59:29] that the prophet
[59:33] did you get mad at me for finding it go
[59:37] ahead and run to next one
[59:38] brother the world falling apart
[59:41] preaching 62 1216 paragraph
[59:47] 159 the church wants one they want their
[59:50] pieces about waved about with every wi
[59:52] of Doctrine to everything sweeps around
[59:54] one of them say oh I think all we have
[59:57] to do you
[59:58] think you ain't got no think
[1:00:02] coming if you think that's the only time
[1:00:04] he said that run in there you ain't got
[1:00:06] just put think coming in your computer
[1:00:09] he said it about three or four times he
[1:00:10] wouldn't play with words he wouldn't
[1:00:13] just you know think coming that's look
[1:00:16] God's done expressed his thoughts you
[1:00:19] ain't got no right to
[1:00:21] think now if you're going to be a
[1:00:23] Christian right right now if you're not
[1:00:26] you can take all you want to Y
[1:00:29] right but if you're going to be a
[1:00:30] Christian all right why why is it you
[1:00:34] don't have a right to
[1:00:35] think let the mind that was in Christ be
[1:00:38] in
[1:00:39] you let him think and he purposed and
[1:00:43] done the will of God he said if I do not
[1:00:46] the works of God then don't believe me
[1:00:47] see you ain't got no think coming he's
[1:00:50] the one does the
[1:00:53] thinking now that's
[1:00:57] Christians but oh how we love to sit in
[1:01:00] that little part of reasoning memories
[1:01:03] and conscience and
[1:01:08] affections but don't you think that
[1:01:10] brother so and so is a good preacher
[1:01:12] well praise the
[1:01:15] lord it's like my wife there's a lady
[1:01:17] said to her one time talking about a man
[1:01:19] over in India and said boy we would have
[1:01:22] watch not say nothing about him
[1:01:26] don't don't say nothing about that man
[1:01:28] she said is he off the message does he
[1:01:30] believe brother Brown's said no he don't
[1:01:31] believe brother Brown's she said well I
[1:01:33] can talk about
[1:01:35] him that's right
[1:01:39] right why because it's it's either Truth
[1:01:43] Or Not truth
[1:01:44] amen see look what he
[1:01:47] said let his mind be in you you just
[1:01:51] think the same and that's his word how
[1:01:54] how you going to think
[1:01:56] different he's done expressed his
[1:01:58] thoughts to us but we want to do our
[1:02:01] thinking I think they ought to do this
[1:02:05] we have no right to
[1:02:08] think
[1:02:09] why because you enter right straight
[1:02:11] into the Realms that
[1:02:15] Satan wants us
[1:02:17] in when we try to reason out
[1:02:23] things
[1:02:25] we try to figure it
[1:02:28] out I've tried to tell you many times
[1:02:32] about a simple Ministry God has given me
[1:02:36] I Don't Preach nothing until it's
[1:02:38] revealed
[1:02:40] right and when it's
[1:02:42] revealed it's open to the
[1:02:46] world if it's been revealed to me I
[1:02:49] don't worry about it that a lot of
[1:02:51] things ain't been revealed to me sounds
[1:02:53] real beautiful
[1:02:55] I ain't going to preach on it when I
[1:02:57] preach on it you can Bank it and say
[1:02:59] it's revealed to
[1:03:01] him you say well everybody says that I
[1:03:05] agree with you I never heard a preacher
[1:03:07] yet say that God didn't reveal the word
[1:03:09] to him have
[1:03:11] you I mean have you ever heard one the
[1:03:13] devil told me this but I'm going
[1:03:15] preaching no no no it don't work that
[1:03:18] way folks everybody thinks they got the
[1:03:21] truth
[1:03:23] right right but will they stand the test
[1:03:28] amen what was it brother R said he said
[1:03:31] I'll be glad to see the day that you'll
[1:03:33] stand up and say that's not what Paul
[1:03:37] preached
[1:03:40] right glad somebody will do
[1:03:43] that but think about it
[1:03:50] now let's jump
[1:03:53] over I wondered today and it word all
[1:03:56] day trying to figure out how to present
[1:04:01] things so let's just read what happened
[1:04:04] in the garden I'll get back to these
[1:04:06] other quotes Brothers
[1:04:08] later so we read when we started out in
[1:04:12] Genesis we read what happened and the
[1:04:15] things you know
[1:04:18] and let's start on Genesis 3 and 8 which
[1:04:21] will be number eight
[1:04:23] brothers
[1:04:28] and
[1:04:31] watch after the situation had
[1:04:34] happened the things had been
[1:04:38] done look where we start
[1:04:40] off and they heard the voice of the Lord
[1:04:44] God Walking In The Garden in the cool of
[1:04:47] the
[1:04:48] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:04:53] from the presence of the the Lord God
[1:04:54] amongst the Trees of the
[1:04:57] garden now why did they
[1:05:00] hide if they was
[1:05:03] right you know what brother random
[1:05:06] said he said Adam and Eve was back in
[1:05:09] the bushes having Church what he said
[1:05:12] you want to take go said they were back
[1:05:15] in there having church that's
[1:05:19] right you know
[1:05:21] what Eve was still trying her best to
[1:05:24] tell Adam that she was right now I
[1:05:26] didn't quote it brother Brown was one
[1:05:27] that
[1:05:28] said and she still thinks she's
[1:05:35] right all
[1:05:37] right
[1:05:39] now they hid
[1:05:42] themselves from the presence of the
[1:05:50] Lord they must have been must have know
[1:05:53] is
[1:05:57] wrong
[1:05:59] but let's bring that over to
[1:06:04] here let's bring it over to our
[1:06:09] day people walk right up in the presence
[1:06:12] of God we're going to read about a man
[1:06:14] doing it but what about
[1:06:17] today we got the truth you got to come
[1:06:20] to our church you got to come to our way
[1:06:22] of seeing the message
[1:06:26] right well brother Dale that's what you
[1:06:28] say show me the
[1:06:33] tape I've said we got to stay with the
[1:06:35] truth right yes sir re but I ain't never
[1:06:39] said you got to come to
[1:06:43] Lula
[1:06:45] right
[1:06:47] now but get my
[1:06:50] point when it first happened
[1:06:56] they were
[1:07:00] hiding but after a
[1:07:06] while things starts
[1:07:10] changing Cain right in the presence of
[1:07:14] God he said am I My Brother's
[1:07:19] Keeper right in the presence of God that
[1:07:23] he had just killed the
[1:07:28] man didn't take long for the
[1:07:31] embarrassment to wipe off did
[1:07:34] it that's why the best thing to do when
[1:07:37] you feel embarrassed or you feel bad
[1:07:39] about something you've done best thing
[1:07:41] to do is get rid of it right then cuz if
[1:07:43] you don't an hour later it's going to
[1:07:46] start being the other person's fault
[1:07:47] instead of you how many times have I
[1:07:50] expressed that
[1:07:52] okay just looking at the
[1:07:56] scriptures what
[1:07:59] happened and the Lord God called unto
[1:08:01] Adam and said unto him where art
[1:08:05] thou instead of brother Brown said
[1:08:07] instead of Adam and Eve running hunting
[1:08:09] God it was God having to hunt Adam
[1:08:13] right and he said I heard thy voice in
[1:08:15] the garden and was
[1:08:17] afraid why was he
[1:08:19] afraid because I was
[1:08:22] naked
[1:08:26] right I was
[1:08:28] afraid because I was
[1:08:32] naked and he didn't know he's naked
[1:08:36] before so he surely wouldn't eat an
[1:08:39] apple right some fruit we'll get to that
[1:08:43] more in a
[1:08:45] minute I was naked and hid
[1:08:49] myself and he said who told thee that
[1:08:52] thou was naked
[1:08:55] that's what God Said to Adam look hast
[1:08:58] thou eaten of the tree whereof I
[1:09:00] commanded thee that thou should us not
[1:09:01] eat truee of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:09:04] would let them know that's
[1:09:07] naked
[1:09:09] right Tree of Life lets you know you're
[1:09:12] clothed
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:21] right and the man said the woman he
[1:09:23] didn't need say wife now we had done
[1:09:26] read back up here before there that it
[1:09:28] talks
[1:09:29] about uh where was it uh verse
[1:09:32] 8 it says Adam and his wife hid
[1:09:37] themselves now when he gets down to hear
[1:09:41] he's backing
[1:09:42] up
[1:09:44] right and what does he
[1:09:49] say and the man said the woman whom thou
[1:09:52] gavest to be with me
[1:09:54] she gave me of the tree and I did
[1:09:58] eat the Lord God said unto the woman
[1:10:01] what is this that thou has done and the
[1:10:03] woman said the serpent beguiled me and I
[1:10:06] did
[1:10:10] eat she was defiled right
[1:10:14] begal we got some scriptures in a minute
[1:10:17] on
[1:10:19] it and the Lord God now watch
[1:10:21] immediately as quick as Eve said she's
[1:10:24] what the serpent
[1:10:28] begal
[1:10:30] her he doesn't jump onto her and onto
[1:10:37] Adam
[1:10:39] right he turns right to the
[1:10:42] Beast right now watch this a little bit
[1:10:45] about the
[1:10:47] Beast and the Lord God said unto the
[1:10:49] serpent remember he was a beast he gets
[1:10:52] to be a snake by belly and all that
[1:10:56] remember the serpent was the most subtle
[1:10:57] of all these you remember the
[1:10:59] scriptures the Lord God said unto the
[1:11:01] serpent now I'd like for you to think
[1:11:04] about one thing I I'd like to preach
[1:11:06] about an hour and a half tonight right
[1:11:10] there on the Lord
[1:11:15] God because no matter what they
[1:11:19] done now I know why that couldn't go on
[1:11:24] no matter what they
[1:11:28] done he never went back to the title of
[1:11:35] God right how much how long have I
[1:11:38] preached it start off in Genesis one you
[1:11:40] got God all the way through 33 times and
[1:11:42] then you start off as quick as you start
[1:11:44] talking about man and the coming into
[1:11:46] being of man he goes to lord god Jehovah
[1:11:50] Elohim Jehovah f um father with his
[1:11:57] family now I won't ask you the question
[1:12:01] so I just won't mention let get to it
[1:12:04] all
[1:12:04] right the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:12:08] because I has done this Thou Art
[1:12:12] cursed I want you to show me where he
[1:12:14] ever cursed Adam and
[1:12:22] Eve
[1:12:24] I got brother randam said where where he
[1:12:25] said he
[1:12:29] didn't you said look like it it does
[1:12:32] look like he' curs this a poor old
[1:12:36] animal and you know what brother Rand
[1:12:38] said about the animal we'll get to it
[1:12:40] next time I preach on it he said the
[1:12:44] animal was used to bring the fall he
[1:12:48] said the animal had to become the
[1:12:52] sacrifice
[1:12:53] amen and the poor old animal's a dumb
[1:12:55] animal they couldn't have what it done
[1:13:01] right do you know I'll get to it in a
[1:13:06] minute you know for a man or a woman to
[1:13:09] lay with a beast is
[1:13:15] death
[1:13:17] let's it's in numbers I'll get to it in
[1:13:19] a
[1:13:21] minute and the Lord God said unto the
[1:13:23] serpent because thou has done this th
[1:13:25] curse above all cattle and above every
[1:13:28] beast of the field upon thy belly shalt
[1:13:30] thy crawl and thus shalt thou eat all
[1:13:33] the days of thy life watch and I'll put
[1:13:36] enmity between thee and the
[1:13:39] woman between the Beast and the
[1:13:45] woman he talking about the Beast and
[1:13:47] where he gets the
[1:13:49] curse right switches right back to
[1:13:52] talking to to the
[1:13:55] Devil he's talking to the animal here
[1:13:59] talking to the devil here I'll put
[1:14:01] enmity between thee and the woman and
[1:14:04] between thy seed and brother R said then
[1:14:07] you tell me that serpent didn't have a
[1:14:10] seed and her seed and it shall bruise
[1:14:14] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:14:15] that's just speaking of Jesus Christ
[1:14:17] coming right he turned right to the
[1:14:19] devil talking to it now watch him roll
[1:14:22] on that where we get it now he turns to
[1:14:24] the woman and to the woman he says I
[1:14:26] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[1:14:29] conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring
[1:14:32] forth children and thy desire shall be
[1:14:34] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[1:14:36] thee now remember they were coequal to
[1:14:39] start with but now he's her ruler
[1:14:44] why and remember if it had been eating
[1:14:47] apple roll it back down just a little
[1:14:49] brother first if it had been an apple
[1:14:55] why and watch now he never cursed
[1:15:00] her that's in the future home I'll get
[1:15:02] it just a minute I'll give you the page
[1:15:05] on not now but 3:25 326 of the future
[1:15:12] home and unto the woman he said I will
[1:15:14] greatly multiply thy
[1:15:16] sorrow now that ought prove enough to
[1:15:18] know what
[1:15:19] happened she ate apple she already got
[1:15:21] the belly ache
[1:15:25] right but he multiplied her sorrow and
[1:15:31] childbearing why
[1:15:33] because that's what she'd
[1:15:36] done and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:15:39] husband and he shall rule over
[1:15:42] thee kind of perverted today to now so
[1:15:44] they got women and men and all that
[1:15:46] doings but don't worry about it
[1:15:49] what no
[1:15:52] curse you say that's a curse because she
[1:15:55] was put no that's not a
[1:15:57] curse a curse would have been to death
[1:16:00] that's what I'll get to it in the minute
[1:16:02] if EV had got what she deserved she'd
[1:16:03] have been killed right
[1:16:06] there because the Bible
[1:16:09] says woman to lay with an animal kill
[1:16:12] her and the animal It also says if a man
[1:16:19] does not a curse he never lost a Lord
[1:16:23] God that's what I said I love to preach
[1:16:25] on that they never lost the Lord God it
[1:16:30] was
[1:16:32] Daddy there was Daddy standing
[1:16:38] there he didn't say Eve you'll
[1:16:44] die he didn't say Adam you're dead
[1:16:47] you're going to
[1:16:50] die he just told him what life would be
[1:16:56] like never cursed
[1:16:58] Eve never cursed Adam you only cursed a
[1:17:03] beast what and unto Adam he said because
[1:17:07] thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy
[1:17:10] wife and has eaten of the tree of which
[1:17:12] I commanded thee saying thou sh shalt
[1:17:14] not eat of it cursed is the
[1:17:18] ground not cursed Adam cursed is the
[1:17:22] ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt
[1:17:24] thou eat of it all the days of thy life
[1:17:27] thorns and cyles shall it bring
[1:17:30] forth Thou shalt eat the herb of the
[1:17:32] field in the sweat of thy face shal th
[1:17:35] eat bread they thou return unto the
[1:17:37] ground for out of it thou was taken for
[1:17:40] thust thou art and thust thou shalt
[1:17:43] return still didn't leave him and Adam
[1:17:47] called his wife's name
[1:17:49] Eve she never had a name until then
[1:17:53] her name was
[1:17:55] Adam because Eve was the mother of all
[1:17:58] living
[1:18:01] okay Eve's the mother of Cain Eve's the
[1:18:04] mother of Abel
[1:18:07] right she's a mother of all living
[1:18:12] amen CU that's the only
[1:18:15] two two lineages you can run
[1:18:18] right and unto Adam also and unto his
[1:18:21] wife that the Lord God
[1:18:25] make some peptic AC's and put in their
[1:18:28] stomach because the apples had messed
[1:18:31] him
[1:18:34] up not exactly
[1:18:38] right but get it and unto Adam and to
[1:18:41] his wife did the Lord God make coats of
[1:18:45] skin and clothe
[1:18:47] them and the Lord God said behold a man
[1:18:50] has become as one of us to know good and
[1:18:54] evil and now lastest he put forth his
[1:18:56] hand and take also over the tree of life
[1:18:59] and eat and live
[1:19:03] forever run that in your translation and
[1:19:06] see it doesn't say
[1:19:09] Eternal because they would be Sinners
[1:19:13] you can't have eternal
[1:19:15] Sinners
[1:19:17] righten
[1:19:19] right forever is a space of time
[1:19:25] right therefore the Lord God sent him
[1:19:27] from the Garden of Eden to steal the
[1:19:28] ground from whence where he was given so
[1:19:30] he drove out drove out the man and he
[1:19:33] placed at the east of the Garden of Eden
[1:19:35] cherubims and a flaming sword which
[1:19:37] turned every way to keep the way of the
[1:19:40] Tree of Life little brother said that
[1:19:42] sword was placed in the side of the Lord
[1:19:46] Jesus and said from that time the angels
[1:19:49] are now running us to the Tree of Life
[1:19:53] right the church a Messengers the angels
[1:19:56] are running us to the tree of
[1:19:58] life but not cursed Adam
[1:20:03] right and not curse
[1:20:06] Eve curse the
[1:20:09] ground curse the snake the serpent the
[1:20:13] Beast look at number 88 which is the one
[1:20:16] I was quoting 325 3:26
[1:20:20] 27 of the future home preach 4
[1:20:24] 802 but that was the closest thing see
[1:20:27] they can't find that species between a
[1:20:30] chimpanzee and a man see each one as
[1:20:33] it's evoluted up from the birds and on
[1:20:36] up to the monkeys and so forth up to the
[1:20:38] chimpanzee then there's a lost that was
[1:20:41] the serpent not a snake every form is
[1:20:44] lost from him because he
[1:20:47] was
[1:20:50] cursed right now God God didn't curse
[1:20:53] Adam he might have done the same
[1:20:56] thing but he cursed the Earth thorns and
[1:21:00] thistles run it on it to make sure they
[1:21:02] get this on the internet cuz people
[1:21:04] don't want that one he didn't curse
[1:21:08] Eve but said Adam would be her ruler
[1:21:13] now she ain't trying any preaching or
[1:21:16] anything Adam is a ruler all the days of
[1:21:19] your life and it's Sor you shall bring
[1:21:21] your life bring your life into the Earth
[1:21:24] but he said I'll put enmity between your
[1:21:27] seat didn't curse
[1:21:32] her why because Lord God is still
[1:21:39] there that animal didn't have a
[1:21:44] soul and Adam and Eve did
[1:21:48] amen and he never cursed
[1:21:51] him
[1:21:53] he stayed the Lord
[1:21:55] God never went back to God self-existing
[1:22:03] never done
[1:22:09] it I go any further I have to take up
[1:22:12] more but I will give you these
[1:22:13] scriptures what it's in Leviticus let's
[1:22:15] go with 8 B and then we'll
[1:22:19] stop Leviticus 20 and 15 and 16
[1:22:24] and if a man lie with a beast he shall
[1:22:26] surely be put to death and you shall
[1:22:28] slay the Beast and if a woman approach
[1:22:31] unto a beast and lie down there unto
[1:22:34] Thou shalt kill the woman and the Beast
[1:22:37] they shall surely be put to death their
[1:22:40] blood shall be upon
[1:22:44] them but
[1:22:48] remember that scripture wasn't
[1:22:51] applied
[1:22:53] right somebody kept it from being
[1:22:56] applied oh that was written over there
[1:22:58] hundreds thousands of years
[1:23:00] lat uh John 6 3:16 was written a long
[1:23:03] time ago you believe
[1:23:08] it you see what it would have been had
[1:23:11] he cursed
[1:23:14] them they would have been
[1:23:19] dead you say well Adam never went with a
[1:23:21] beast no but he went with a woman that
[1:23:25] had had the
[1:23:31] beast but he didn't curse him I love it
[1:23:36] may not mean a thing to
[1:23:39] you but God never kept never backed on
[1:23:42] his
[1:23:46] word when he made Man In His
[1:23:50] Image and put him in flesh
[1:23:54] flesh he made him in his image he was
[1:23:57] self-existing under the word
[1:24:00] God but when he made him in flesh he
[1:24:02] become lord god Jehovah Elohim like a
[1:24:05] father with his family and he never left
[1:24:08] his family
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:15] now there's where predestination comes
[1:24:21] in God would know that mankind would
[1:24:28] sin he could set everything in order
[1:24:30] remember the message of the day to bring
[1:24:32] out to
[1:24:37] P but he didn't predestinate by his
[1:24:39] desires because if he had he'd killed
[1:24:41] Adam and Eve
[1:24:44] both so he just curse the animal curse
[1:24:47] the
[1:24:48] ground put Adam and Eve under a
[1:24:51] condition that shows what happened
[1:24:55] shows they didn't eat an
[1:24:58] apple CU an eve would be the Sorrows of
[1:25:03] childbearing childbearing is a wonderful
[1:25:08] thing of bringing into life but there
[1:25:11] sorrow that goes with
[1:25:14] it you
[1:25:17] know sister Anna is getting around to
[1:25:19] the place now to that little baby in out
[1:25:22] of there I'll just start kicking the
[1:25:24] Daylights out of
[1:25:26] her and the first time you may rub it
[1:25:30] and say praise the Lord but right in the
[1:25:32] middle of the night and it kicks and
[1:25:34] wakes you up you ain't going to harder
[1:25:36] praise the Lord you're going to say
[1:25:37] honey go back to
[1:25:39] sleep
[1:25:42] Sara makes her to where she had to have
[1:25:46] a 28 day
[1:25:51] thing
[1:25:53] right wound up to be called in bleeding
[1:25:56] of the
[1:25:58] wound but you
[1:26:00] know God would still take
[1:26:04] that that
[1:26:06] wound and he would bring
[1:26:08] Christ through that
[1:26:12] wound because he kept his
[1:26:18] word he loved Adam and Eve he knew
[1:26:21] they'd fall
[1:26:24] but he knew that they would want to do
[1:26:26] right we'll get to it
[1:26:29] later he knew Abel would want to do
[1:26:33] right but he knew Cain would want to do
[1:26:40] wrong so he could
[1:26:44] predestinate not too bad of word is it
[1:26:47] come on Brothers not too bad of talking
[1:26:50] about predestination you get it in the
[1:26:51] right way
[1:26:54] I hope you understand what I'm getting
[1:26:55] at just to read the scriptures and just
[1:26:57] talk about them a little
[1:27:04] bit and that God never did curse Adam
[1:27:07] and
[1:27:09] Eve if he'd have cursed him that would
[1:27:11] have been the end of
[1:27:18] it he didn't curse
[1:27:21] him
[1:27:23] you know what brother random says at the
[1:27:25] point happens that where he talking
[1:27:27] about that they were going that they
[1:27:30] were let's see how what is the scripture
[1:27:32] now
[1:27:35] uh and I'll put enmity between thy seed
[1:27:38] and the seed of the woman you know where
[1:27:39] brother R said that was quoted as
[1:27:43] being when Adam and Eve was leaving out
[1:27:46] of the
[1:27:48] garden see we put it over
[1:27:51] here
[1:27:52] he said when the going out of the garden
[1:27:55] with the bloody skins flapping against
[1:27:58] her legs and it looked horrible because
[1:28:02] it looked like it was no
[1:28:04] hopes said God screamed out and said but
[1:28:07] I'll put
[1:28:09] enmity between thy seed and the seed of
[1:28:12] the
[1:28:13] woman I've made a way that's right
[1:28:17] you're going to be in trouble and you're
[1:28:18] going to have life and
[1:28:21] sorrows
[1:28:23] going to be
[1:28:24] horrible but I've made a way amen I'm
[1:28:28] going to
[1:28:29] come and I'm going to
[1:28:35] die but you see church we get into those
[1:28:39] reasoning
[1:28:42] factors and people will say my God can't
[1:28:45] die my God can't feel pain my God can't
[1:28:48] do this this my God can't
[1:28:51] that
[1:28:53] you better
[1:28:55] remember God must have been real back
[1:28:58] there in the
[1:29:00] garden because you know what he
[1:29:03] done he pulled the skins off of those
[1:29:07] animals amen he
[1:29:09] killed the
[1:29:12] animals he no he's just a spirit he just
[1:29:16] he ain't that he's just a spirit brother
[1:29:18] Dale he tore them skins off of that
[1:29:21] animal
[1:29:23] amen and put it on Adam and
[1:29:27] Eve must be pretty
[1:29:31] real I keep getting them little flickers
[1:29:33] and every once in a
[1:29:36] while I'm getting closer to being able
