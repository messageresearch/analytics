holy you are holy holy holy holy and I want to see you amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you good to see about in the house the Lord if you like turning your scriptures turn where we've been reading last couple of messages from the first Peter one and then the second Peter one never pray for Nana she's really out of a bad case of strep throat you know just keep her in your prayers because she's not able to hardly even drink anything he's having trouble doing that let alone try to eat you know remember that remember brother I all he said they told him that he had a trach your narrow tract infection you know and said it was affecting him real bad so to remember that break the Lord would bless we got a little note from brother Quinn and he was going to leave out to go where was it going to anyhow he was leading you on a trip and he wound up got a flu bug and he wound up in bed for a good week or so in the lost city lost eight pounds there in that time and all of us who just prayed the Lord would bless but any what he wants to do is according to what he's saying he wants us to pray the cause of his applying for you know the tickets and things he's hoping to try to get it where he can go this year on finishing up in our trip later on this year and said for us to pray for that so just remember him any priors and if you love brother Quinn loves to go and travel

so we believe you have your way with us as we read your word you just come and manifest yourself to each and every one of us we love you forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us clean in Jesus name Amen had a good time this past weekend with a fellowship meeting brother Ernie ministering for us and and I also pray for him as he travels along ok first Peter 1 going to verse 18 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as it a lamb as of a lamb without blemish and without spot Hoover lee was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory and that your faith and hope might be in God seeing you how purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see if you love one another with pure with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever now to me there's only one thing that there's no way to corrupt it and that is the word you said well look what they've done no they didn't corrupt the word you can't corrupt the word now your thoughts and ideas can provide all of what you're thinking and confuse people which you can't mess with that word it's forever settled okay now then that way we can stand on it second Peter one Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and oh Jesus our Lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge you may be seated the Lord added his blessing to the reading of the word now we've reached kind of a place and you know I've been heading toward this for months in the message but we reached a place that the we're going to have to make our own commitments you know within ourselves you know to find out and see what we believe and see the words the truth or what it is time is fastly running out we don't have enough time to start over and try to do anything we've got to move on in God all right now I've always taught you to believe it that you can take the Bible and make it say what you want it to say now you take it you make it it doesn't change the wording right and all of doctrines in the world is only one Bible there's not all not a thousand different Bibles there's one Bible that mankind has taken that Bible and you can prove anything you want to by pulling out quotes you know thoughts and make it say what you want it to say you can take this message and do the thing at the same time and you can make it say anything you want it to say but it don't change the letter of the word the word is there it's it's dark you know to be studied and you know but you can make it according to your thinking applied to anything you want it to be all right now that has caused in a vast difference in the people of the message all right and then like I gave you the quote where brother Branham said the baptism of the Holy Ghost had been so incorrectly talks that they had about 900 different ways of seeing it of one little thought or an idea how about in the message and all of the people and the thoughts of the people of this message and you know anything you say to me I don't mean this wrong what I mean it's it's the way it is done that you can take and make a quote you can pull a quote you can pull it out and you can run real good with it you know and try to make something say what you want it to say but now the Bible doesn't say but one thing there's one faith one Lord one baptism right all right now in the message there's one message what it's laid out the way it's supposed to be and you can't question why a prophet would say things in a certain way I said a certain way now I don't say saying it wrong now I know years ago some of them said what c-virus did you know the Prophet said he's too many following the message so he come up with something doc no you can't do that not to run people all that's not God in his wife he just comes on the scene and by coming on the scene contrary to mankind he'll automatically confuse mankind right so you can take the message you can make it say what you want it to say and you can can prove your point as I said by oh I've got these quotes I've got this I remember one brother said one time he said I told my wife said I only got about 2,000 quotes on this I don't know where to preach it or not well it's not quotes there's only one revelation in the Bible that's the revelation of Jesus Christ all right there's only one revelation in this message and that's the revelation of Jesus Christ okay now we may pervert twist turn do whatever we do with it to make it say what we want it to say try to prove our point with it but remember we'll answer for the things that we do in any form of that way okay now in in talking like that I'm trying to get you to think about something because you know I have my ministry has always seemed to be the I don't know how to explain it but it's always been in that realm that what was has been confusing to the people you know it's always seemed to be something within me wants to express it and try to get it correct you know and you say well everybody wants to do that I know problems I'm not saying that I'm just saying that the things that other ministers would not tackle or bring out into the open then you know that this seems to be my ministry that - worth it that I want it to be right because I believe it's right I believe there's just one faith one Lord one baptism I believe there's just one message that the Prophet has brought them to us but yet look at the splits the pools the divisions and the things and everybody says we say what he says and you know to the degree that's true you know there's I say in our moment ago where the Prophet said there's 900 different ways of seeing the baptism of the Holy Ghost by mankind you realize each one of them has so much word each one out of 900 they have so much word it may be a small amount but still they have so much word all right and see then you can't just lay it on well well I got this quarter I got that one all right see then the way I do is when I see something that looks contrary I won't approach that until I see it in a satisfaction maybe okay no problem you know I don't claim to be the only pebble on the beach I mean they were a group they're worried about it I just hope I hope I'm on the beach the pebbles ain't worried about all right but I've always just said looked at something and said well okay now if there's so much wrong about this surely there's a truth some work you know if there's so much wrong well we don't need to know this we don't need to know that that's what I was making this statement the other night you know the other day about it I asked you a simple question how do we get the virtues we say well it's the opening of the word all right I hope you hold that point for a little bit opening of the word all right I believe that that's exactly what it is but the Prophet said 3:27 church age book this messenger of Malachi 4:2 Luke 1730 would do two things one turn ogress or the children back to the faith of the fathers to reveal the thunders which was a revelation contained in the seven seals and he said it would be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back all right darted me is the key that's the key that I've always preached since about nineteen and eighty when the Lord showed me that from the scriptures of DARS the key if you want to know how to get to virtues you got to go to the seals well I don't think you need to know about to seal well how are you gonna get diverges if that statement is true now I mean simple as that statement if it's true if the Prophet meant that if he said that and he meant that see then we have no right to question and like I asked how many people has even read a sealed book all the way through the biggest problem is is the ones that ain't even ever read it - ooh can you tell you all about it you know I mean argue were you like crazy and they ain't even never read the book well see but that person is popular because they have an argumentative point of trying to make their point so we don't have to understand well now why is it in the Bible to understand I mean I thought one of the virtues was knowledge I thought it was whether or not acts 2:38 contradicted Matthew 28:19 I thought that was the kind of knowledge if you understand what I'm saying see we can take it and make it say what we want it to say well I think if God wants me to have them things here let's give them to me yeah I know how to quote a little bit of that I know where the quote is there that if God's obligated to give us the word and that if it's needed he'll put somebody on the pulpit to bring that word I know I know what the message says but what if the person he puts on the pulpit is bringing what we have need of but yet we don't know that's what we need and see that way then it's always to work that people think well you're just trying to be this you're trying to be that no I'm trying to do one thing I want to know we've been here 50 years since we're leaving of the Prophet I mean what's gonna happen well we got to figure it out this way though okay I pray to God that something will happen very quickly you know because if not then you know a lot of us is getting too old to try to worry about it tomorrow we better be worried about the rest of the night right you know when you when you pace that 70 mark you're downhill and you quit thinking about anything future and you start trying to think about what was the paste then after a while you get to the vices you can't remember and when you can't remember where you're at he saw you silly well that's true but it's true and you know no but listen Church all I'm trying to say is one thing that to me the Bible the message on the Bible and the message shows one revelation I've never believed it would not be a body of Christ to say everybody has got the same little parts you know or whatever you want to say it wouldn't be a body of Christ I've never taught nothing like that quarter don't believe it and I never have believed it it's only at Lula I've never taught nothing like that I believe it's around the world you know and around the world God is dealing with his bride I'm just interested in finding out I got a little note the other day on something that I'm I'm really going to give some emphasis because you know it came through and and and I read it and you know the man's got a real good talks about the new birth I want to find out some more about it of what he's saying because from what I read I couldn't find anything wrong with it well if you can read a whole lot like I did it's a full book it's about 70 something pages and I'm interested in hearing what somebody else has to say because I've always believed one time faith don't come by preaching now somebody's got a priest you understand get the point but faith that doesn't say comes by preaching it says faith comes by hearing right that's why did I've never understood the people about it color you know they say tongues is evidence well it was never tongues it was the hearing right it was the hearing not to talk not to speaking you know I don't get to help but that's alright but still think about it so you'll see what I'm trying to drive that I've told you what I believe I went through it this past Wednesday I kind of covered all the way through covering into seeing what to expect and what to do you know and and and I believe the message is right all right but I believe that if you don't make a statement see that's working mostly ministers they won't well I believe it but didn't you tunne say something they just kind of they kind of bounced around you know a little bit they don't want to just be put right on that spot that's why I've always say it I believe in one true and living God I believe in water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe the things of the Bible is true all right and I don't mind putting my life behind that point of interest to say that's what I believe you saw brother Dale what do you believe you you asked a lot of people why they believe you're gonna get a bypass answer or a halfway answer or I don't know answer or some kind of something but you ask me I'm gonna tell you you know now if you don't want to know don't ask me because when you ask me I'm gonna tell you what I believe to the tee because that's what I believe I want it I want to be honest and sincere with you the word at least when it comes to the last days and we're all standing there I want it to be whether or not that I tried to help you to get to that place is my desire all right and see then in doing it just like I said or any face 900 different ways of seeding the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right then I think it's serious matter for us to find out what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what the truth is but I can take the Bible and the Prophet and make it say anything you want it to say about the baptism but that's no good but it's true you ought to know it's true and when I look at his things I look at it and when I'm reading and studying it now I'm looking at what I believe will be helpful for me and you all right and you say well brother Brown said this brother Dale why did he say this why did he say that well I at least want to be able to be familiar of what you're saying you know to study that thought and then wait on the Lord to try to get an answer don't claim all the answers but at least I'll study the thought to try to get the right answer because my concern is you you know and I don't have to worry about it because I'm like what brother around him said and I love that point he said don't matter where I preach or not he said I'm saved and that don't have nothing to do with it I'm not preaching to try to get saved I'm not preaching to try to go to heaven that's already saddled what I'm preaching to try to help somebody else you know to where they can I thought we believed in Christianity was living for others I thought that was the point of eternal life was to live for others and and trying to do like that and in doing it then trying to help all right and see then we're heading now to in the next message the Lord willing probably the next or the next somewhere right in there we're going to start dealing in the message that was taught by the Prophet that was called adoption all right so if you want to read a lot in those times there's one book dard it's got four in it you know the different things of adoption you want to read that listen to the message here um there's about 20 or 30 of them listen to the hose whatever you can do I'm asked sometimes with what should I read or study all right read real careful Romans 8 read it over and over and over to you well familiar with it read Galatians 3 and 4 especially Galatians 4 that when you come in to your tutors and you go of nursing or different things read those things and you'll be familiar with it and then when you do you'll understand why I'm saying this or that or the other about it because we try to follow what was brought to us by the Prophet we've got what he says but it's not a jumbled up mess of an argument from one to the other you know it's the truth and I admit that sometimes you got to wait a long time to find the right answer you know I don't have no problems with that you know you ever heard right around said he wouldn't preach on hell and talitha till he found out what it was you know until it was revealed to him he wouldn't preach well I've held off many a thing that I wouldn't preach on because I didn't have a clear understanding and then sometimes you have to move out into realms to get understandings you know and wait on the Lord then as of what to do and we spent quite a while talking about salvation talking about how this on vote unveiled before us - all the way through the Old Testament come into the New Testament then with it and we start now on the day of Pentecost speaking about the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right now I have made myself clear and straight of what I believe about the new birth okay we've taken some things that brother branham has said that you could take those things and make him say what you wanted him to say you know and just do what you want to be could twist it but trying not to - but trying to believe it and trying to accept him why he would say it all right as I was bringing our moment ago I don't believe brother branham you know he said there's too many following this message all right but did he deliberately go out and catch up a doctrine or an idea to try to confuse people or did he just go on with the truth I believe he went on with the truth I don't believe he had to worry about none of it yeah he didn't have to make up something you can't have the Prophet you can have God deliberately blinding the eyes of people without a day of grace to be given there has to be a grace to be given like the field field you yeah God blinded the eyes are those shoes where we could be brought in but he's going to give him eternal holiday okay see then he's wonder what bringing the grace all right I've talked to you in this series over and over one thing that I believe and then we're going to make some statements when we get to the end of the message didn't hide a little bit that's gonna sound contrary to what I've said well let's wait and see you know find out what God has to say about the situation could I believe that your new birth according to the Prophet starts when you believe didn't say complete it didn't say it was done he just said it stars when you believe because everything's got to start when you believe huh accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior believing in him that starts your Christian journey better known as repentance our justification you know whatever you want to bring it to the point of see you believing and then when it comes to the day of the quickening of what you believe if that's right it'll bring forth of birth when that word that you've received is quickened or made alive it'll bring forth a birth unto you all right see then I believe the new birth the being born again according to Jesus and John 3 you must be born again I believe it takes justification st. case the baptismal goes to make the new birth it takes justification sanctification baptism with hold ago to make the born-again experience to be into reality then it takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost to seal all of that off then I believe the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and being born again it's one in the same it's not one thing coming out to make away for another where do we get to that one when the Prophet says it and he quotes to Charles fuller and somebody else and he said I didn't never know that anybody else believed like I did he makes a statement there that his sounds like he don't even believe what in the world he's taught yet we believe it's the truth but I can take the prophets message and the Bible and try to show you the new birth is this something over here or the born-again is something here or the baptism is something here but why would it be any different if the new birth is justification same case in the baptism of the old God if the born-again experience is justification sanctification the baptism in the Holy Spirit if the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the baptism in the Holy Spirit and we don't have to - you remember that quote we don't to have have two baptisms of the Holy Spirit prophet said there's only one Holy Spirit yeah but there's no no no don't try to jump on anointed one to try to make it to different spirit it's the same spirit I didn't teach you - anyway your prophet did it's the same Holy Spirit it's just according to what's on the interior part that could be quickened we're the anointed one is on your spirit but it's still the same Holy Spirit may I quote the Prophet the Holy Spirit the baptism of those quicken or justifies you it sanctifies you and then the baptism is the Holy Spirit the very person itself see then you can pull anything apart to make it say what you want and it sounds like that sometimes even the Prophet doesn't have understanding and listen I do believe honestly he groped in Grayson knowledge I do but then once he begins to make his statements once he settled down on something from then on that statement is correct you may have something to fight with or argue with as to dis and I believe he said this and I believe he said that but I thought it was to be one message and one understanding and see then it would fit all the way see that way you don't have to worry about even just you believing on the Lord Jesus Christ without it coming to eternal life you realize when you come to the white throne judgment you have something to help you that God could then give you eternal life because of your confession while you was on earth so don't stop we went through messages of that right we went through things to try to bring it to something and with the last few messages we've dwelt heavily on that what is the new birth it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the Spirit of God baptizing you into the body and it's a revelation of Jesus Christ right it's a revelation of Jesus Christ I didn't give these to the brothers he's on one but I didn't give him so I'll just read him often but listen in the church age book 144 you remember we were giving this and we're talking about the you talking about the different things and he says now people say that receiving Christ is being born again all right now to receive Christ is to receive His Spirit to receive his Spirit is to be born again well to receive the spiritually baptized with the Holy Ghost why can't we believe it that away look what he says on that was paragraph 144 let me get it 154 no go on tell okay 154 somewhere in church a church what is the baptism with the Holy Spirit it's the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the Spirit of God coming in and filling you after you've repented having heard the word when baptized in water huh so what's he saying what is the baptism when holder it's a spirit baptized into the body it's the new Bond he's saying here that you receive Christ who received Christ to be born again to receive the spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost see then why wouldn't we accept our that to me see makes it to work I can say this is what I believe and it's up to you to decide what you believe I've never tried to convince nobody I've never tried to convince my family or anything and I can - daughter-in-law sitting back there our son-in-law you asked them if I ever tried to overload them with them what I believe as a matter of fact I'm in the opposite direction right I got $2 long shaking their head I don't know where the son-in-law is you in the back room oh yes but those two daughter-in-laws will tell you I've never tried to influence them about it I'll answer their questions yes but I never try to influence I've never tried to influence my wife I've never tried to influence my boys or the kids the grandkids reason I want them to make their own decision but I want them to have an opportunity now by I didn't run them all over the country and take them to all kind of places and everything else you know to let their minds get infiltrated with doctrines and ideas I didn't do that that's up to you and your children you're raising your children let's see I'm just saying it that way go be careful what you're taking your children's to here children to here well there and they they they believe the truth over here well some of you have come back and told me that they didn't believe it too much huh okay I'll take your word for it cuz I wasn't there but now listen season I believe that no man can come as the scripture says to Jesus Christ without the father draw on him and that no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be by the baptism of the Holy Spirit not to just say it anointing come on mind spirit in me say it that's still not correct even though it might be the baptism of the Holy Spirit may not you know baby the genuine what I'm talking about something from an inward experience why do you believe what you believe you've got to have your own personal experience that's wild well so heavily from cross the mystery on the message of what did the prophets say what is the new birth brother branham it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's not written to everybody it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus it opens up to you because you have accepted Christ and seeing that then it's a revelation I've tried to emphasize that over and over though we say well brother Dale I didn't get no revelation when I got born again what was what was he doing I mean come on did you just walk in church I want to be born again they told me I need to do this I need to do that I need set Creed I need speaking tongues I need to shout I need to let me do what I got to do so let me just be saved now that ain't according to Scripture now that kind of confession I'd say you didn't get the new birth they worried about it because it's not on that basis if God is calling you he'll call you through somebody right no I got his voice out of heaven yeah you never had been to church and heard nothing I guess okay do you know what I'm talking about it's true somebody brought to you a truth and you've seen that truth and they began to burden you and as it did that's God calling you and then when he when you accept him as your Savior and he accepts you brother Branham said he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and said if you're not accepted of God he won't give it to you so then it could be a young child what what does it say in Christ the mystery to the most illiterate person here give me a young child but they don't know what that means that's why people don't understand you when you say it when you read something to the people they but I didn't get a revelation they don't think about what revelation is they what they think you're saying is and there's in no way am I saying it or you know do you know about the seals you know about the file you know about the plague go over to the over there you ever got a revelation each time well I doubt were you born again cause you ain't got that now I ain't never talked nothing like that and I'm against that and any of these ministers gets up here and start telling it that way you'll find me in a hurry saying hey back off because it can't be something like that it's God dealing personally with you he doesn't deal the same with any you know what he deals different with each one of us but can you remember when something begins to working in within you and you begin to feel different we call it coming under conviction we call it reaching the age of accountabilities we call it no sign but it's God calling you if you answer that call he can give you eternal life there's the revelation see we think it's got to be some revelation some great big thing no it's the most simple thing that there is is accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior and then when he accepts you he'll give you the new birth and that new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ that maybe the church he was in never taught nothing about Jesus Christ you know not a whole lot about it maybe they didn't teach the way the truth of it is but still God can bypass every bit of it and go right down into that heart and speak to that person and convict them then got them right you remember well see I'm not doing away with your experience I'm believing your experience because everybody's experience would be the same experience and I believe that way codasyl revelations Jesus Christ but it's degreed two different ways and thoughts and ideas you'll get far tonight I wanted to go on bender something if I do I'll just jump them in it take off what did brother branham say about this being born again we went to spoken word as regional seed paragraph 151 and then to 161 where brother Brown is talking about the birth of the word is Christ and how God took that word and planted it and the Holy Ghost coming quickened it all right Road ran him on paragraph 161 of spoken words at Regionals see he says now one of them that's the one in the tube so he said it brings you right back again unto the place where you should have been at the beginning you mean that that simple little new birth that you receiving eternal life by accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior brings you back like you should have been in the beginning like you was in the beginning we went through all of that right Adam and Eve had eternal life in their soul the new birth brings you eternal life into your soul that's the way you should have come to start with this is one we didn't give but a random says let me let me read this one we didn't read it they don't have to pull it up I'll get it when spoken word is reading the seed paragraph 2 16 through to 18 he said you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning now listen your prophet but being that you come the way you did you're subject to the following but being that you're predestined did you hear the word it brings you right back where you were predestinated Amen now listen what he said never saw that before he saw something he'd never saw before that's what he said brings you what what makes you believe the Word of God and didn't turn down these other things predestination brings you right back to where you should have been to start with he said never saw that he caught something right to see what it is to be who you and me we were supposed to be in here right to start with but how long did we spend I'm gonna place a lot of this now what is the new birth it's revelation to Jesus Christ if you believe that you can be saved off a mystical faith of substance if you don't believe it you can't be saved now that's how serious it is if you believe it you can be saved if you don't believe it you can't be saved so it's not what you believe right earnestly continuing to the faith he's accepting your faith he's accepted your faith your revelation your point of believing him sure the biggest portion of our faith is mental faiths but lastly be ensigns you remember we went through we said when that Holy Ghost coming down through he said it will bright make your mental faith a spiritual revelation there's a new birth is a spiritual revelation there's the baptism to see that's the hard part I've said baptism we look at baptism we think something's got to be coming down it's got to be something crawling all over us and happening I was looking at one today where bread around said we he said we've had the thunder we've had two lightnings we've had the thought but he said we didn't listen to the steel small voice vennett what the Prophet done the steel small voice we think the baptism has got to be a Baptist why don't we baptize in water the word baptize mean to submerge we say well I was just submerged with the Holy Ghost well why don't you go out and baptize in the water and call it out no it's not that well it's not that either what I've said upper room sure when sure all kind of things happening but where was the birth when that liquor file little each one of them in quickened within their their heart what they had heard darzee baptism when the Holy Ghost that's why your prophet could say you believe in what the baptism goes without a sensation now he never said you without an experience without a sensation but see Church on the statue of a perfect man he says the Holy Ghost coming down true Christ Holy Spirit welding these things together what'd he say blaspheme his name he says all of this gets finally welded together and see when it's all finished as we walk off this earth we can say we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost we can say we have the new birth we say we can say we have the morning and experience but each one will be a little bit speaking of it a little bit dividing I liken it in my thoughts to the five times of coming of Elijah when John gets over there and it emphatically seems to deny the very words of God when they said are you Elijah he said no am i right is that in the Bible John says no go see he was not all of Elijah there was for others to be tied up into that so he didn't have all of it so he said I'm not Elijah they said well who are you he said I'm a voice of one crying in the wilderness he made his statement right in the word and see that's the way it is with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new Merck the born-again experience it's all of the same bringing us to a place to where that is Christ living in you we haven't started up the pyramid with the adoptions in time we're just laying this to the point of understanding of getting us to see what's taking place all right well that number 10 up if you want to brother cuz we didn't put that on the others are you getting to number 10 I'll be with number 8 number 9 where he's talking about blasphemous names biggest portion of our faith is mental faith and this coming from above oh brother what's coming what's drawing you is it true now that you can't be saved unless the father calls you know mariah is that Bible well worse the father well where's he at right he's drawing you he's drawing you and wind that Holy Spirit watching biggest part of my faith is mental faith that coming from above if it ever strikes this there's a godly spiritual faith right now watch what he says off the statue of a perfect man right in here right in here you see I got in between all these works in here and here are these little light waves come what is it listen at him listen to your prophet say something that to the world would be mass confusion listen to what he says the Holy Ghost coming down through Christ to see Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is above all this I thought the Holy Spirit was the whole that's what I'm saying you could take anything you want to make him say the Holy Spirit is above all this welding this together building water perfect church for the capstone to cut off that sounds like two or three different persons you've got one holy ghosts up here you got one Holy Ghost in the middle and you've got one Holy Ghost down here but our three Holy Ghost know you only have one holding up that's three manifestations of the same Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost to justify the loser sanctified the Methodist baptized the Pentecostals it's now sitting in order the coming of the Lord is that what the Prophet had to say but see we've got to make it to understand I can take it you can you can make it say what you want to with brother down there he taught three of them cuz he taught Christ and he taught the Holy Ghost and he talked to Holy Spirit if you make him say anything you want him to say by twisting what you're talking about all right now let's get this Feist we went through the message there the other day talking about it the statue of a perfect man you've read it over and over brother Branham says Peter says I have obtained this like precious faith and I'm addressing it to those with like precious faith now told you there the other day making the statements about it to know Holy Ghost people then she didn't have the Holy Ghost and right they say you got turned upside down because you got to get you know you're trying to get it lined up mechanically and it won't work the truth is the truth it's been the Holy Ghost in every Church age it's been the new birth in every church age it's been Christ in every Church age but he said I've obtained paragraph 38 and 33 3 through 37 I have obtained this faith and I'm addressing this to those that have obtained this same faith I'm speaking this to those that are in Christ Jesus born again born-again Christians what's the foundation of all Christianity brother branham we're about 131 through 134 it's the foundation of faith 143 right in there he says he lays the foundation we went through these life wins t he lays the foundation what is the foundation of all Christianity faith it's laid upon your faith what did the prophets say about it he said you got to be born again you've got to be born again and said you're born again at faith now if you want me to read these I've read about a river life's Winston you're born again at faith but remember now I've went over it and over it for all the years you think well I don't mean thing to be you explain two phases two things at penny well you explain it you explained to me how brother Branham could say he met people with the baptism of the holy ghost 50 years before him that was exactly like the day of Pentecost then that's why I came up with that thought many many years ago that God helped me to understand it she then added up a room experience they had been tutored now not ever one of them don't just play with me with words I know how to talk and the 120 a Upper Room I 120 wooden with Jesus for the three and a half years they was only with him for short periods of time in the life some of them coming in but at least they did here more than one but that when that Holy Ghost fell nobody they got the Holy Ghost outside with the 3000 was used to write the word show it to me no no war it was only the one in the upper room when that Holy Ghost failed remember the pot the disciples had been tutored for three and a half years no they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they had God with them that taught him the word when the Holy Ghost failed look were placed him that's hurt the faith of the fathers called brotherly kindness and Holy Spirit faith of the father's that route we'll cover this on another message later that way was lost until the Prophet came to bring it back to us lost in the ages when the word was eat down the way to understand the statute of a perfect man was lost and you come up with the Pentecostals the best you could do and brother Brennan said born into the body of Christ I said not realizing there were just babies now realizing they were just beginning said they thought they had everything right we see that one hundred and twenty three and a half years a lot of them was tutored and trained by the Lord Jesus himself when the Holy Ghost fail look workplace but the 3000 outside heard one Sherman the house of canoe use heard one Sherman I'm not kind of years which one um yeah I guess it is can use it not heard one Sherman and the Holy Ghost fail and the Bible says can we forbid water to seeing the baptize day and they've received the Holy Ghost that we did at the beginning what you see the difference I mean look at it and just think about 120 they had the message planted when the Holy Ghost fell it quicken these to them but around said stature forgive and they had these ruptures what he said the headstone hadn't come yet all right now but ones that were born again of the 3,000 just finally got into the body across that's the best way of saying it because they couldn't have been nothing out they didn't know anything else they didn't even know about Jesus they heard the message and we're quickened and said men and brethren what must we do to be safe repent every one of me baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and 3,000 receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you read statue of a perfect man over and over and over we read around said see there he says you're born again at faith you're in the body of Christ you're converted read the message you've got the new birth and he talks about people of like precious faith Peter said I've got this faith what was he doing Peter had the same Holy Ghost right he's writing to those that are in Christ Jesus who have the Holy Ghost right cause it's not written to the world surely it's not written to the world to try to explain adoptions and and all of these things and headstones and things like that to the world come on at least give the opportunity to get the baby here and let it grow a little bit all right it's based upon your faith and remember what I've said over and over it says add to your faith now it doesn't come on then and say add to your virtue add to your knowledge you better do it add to your faith you don't mean a thing to most of you but brother Branham note exactly what he said he said there are seven adds to the pyramid count them behind me these eight things come on nine technically one two three four six seven eight nine technically but the Holy Spirit is there to weld it in and seal it he says there's seven I adds because see you don't add faith faith is a birth it's your faith quickened unto you and it brings it to his faith that's why I've told you this well it was seven rayher time brother Brown says how faith in God you see there's a lot of difference in having faith in God and having the faith of God the faith of God has eternal life having faith in God is just your faithfulness to believe it how faith in God right we're supposed to but have the faith of God and see where do we get to it and you'll see how it ties together that Peter is taking it to add add to your faith that's like precious faith and he said add virtue and knowledge add tempers to work to your experience because when you are born again you have that new birth in your soul which is the life of Almighty God right which is the new birth which is the born-again experience which is the baptism of the holy spirit to give you eternal life in your soul but now we're going to read something just a minute so hold on listen to the point you must be born again and the born-again experiences faith when your faith your faith to believe God is accepted of God it becomes eternal life read blasphemous names and statue of a perfect man together it becomes eternal life in your soul then you can add virtue to that but it only makes you a baby when we receive the Holy Ghost there's none of us receive the Holy Ghost as the Apostles did it was never after then even the great Apostle Paul to come to where the disciples were he had to receive the new birth and go to himself birth three a ninth years same amount town to the stop of God right and when he comes out of there and watch him Paul doesn't preach the stature of a perfect man that was Peters message Paul preaches adoption now don't you believe they were both saying the same thing Paul's preaching adoption Peters preaching statue of a perfect man now how do you get adopted stature of a perfect man tells you how to get adopted right so Paul comes out preaching the same thing Peter was preaching but preaching it on the basis of what God give him to show the growth development in their and the lives of mankind after you're born again then you're being born again as you're coming up through faith virtue knowledge temperance because all that is holy ghost' added to you it's added to your faith your faith in has become a spiritual revelation which is eternal life so then it's not your faith anymore but it's your faith go God has given it to you it's his faith it's his faith making your faith alive giving you the new birth the Paul and Peter Bowe is explaining the new birth now watch pipe Peter Peter says having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and all this coming to like precious faith I'm addressing this that and he says that you've escaped that of corruption and all through the world and he says add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance what does Paul say Paul says Romans I'm in Galatians 4 Paul said a son is no different than an heir though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors Peter is saying the Holy Ghost is your tutor or governor Paul is saying the holy the tutor the governor is the growth development of the statue of a perfect man do you understand Paul and Peter we're not teaching different they were both teaching the one thing the growth development of Christianity into the hearts of mankind to bring us to an adoption 'el stage and the last of it all is Paul in Romans 8 the adoption to wit to understand the redemption of these bodies why because Paul could not take you to the redemption of the body he could only speak of it he couldn't take it to the moment in the twinkling of an eye he could speak of it he couldn't take it to the point of corruptible putting on incorruption he could only speak of it because it could not be made manifest back there it was to come down to this day I'm not gonna ask for a raise of hands somebody's gonna continue the message because I'd wonder how many of you have called it now to where we can read something brother Branham says and listen to it now remember what I'm saying what I'm reading here is right he just don't sound I don't know how to say it he ends up the last quote that I gave you first thing you got to do is be going born again this is from statue of perfect man paragraph 94 to 96 you've got to be changed and when you're changed you become a new creation now you're getting right now now you don't have to worry about the feathers it can take care of itself when you're born again now notice you must be born again that is changed there's got to be a change jesus said except a man be born again you cannot understand the kingdom alright I'm not asking you for a raise of hand I'm asking you for a simple understanding within your sale do you see the statue of a perfect man and what it is that your faith is when God gives you the new birth and that's at the bottom of the pyramid and ever born-again believer the Apostles came to this part Holy Spirit called the faith of the father's that's why we got to be turned back to where they were but we start our down here as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby we started off with babies as with an earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession I'm quoting scriptures now let's see if we can hold on a minute let's read some things go ahead brothers were gonna jump all the way over to 19 okay never who's on the pole back turn you jumped to 19 the message called key to the door so communion is for Christians that's born again of the Spirit of God and born again does not necessarily mean now that you got the Holy Ghost now remember our now many teach that and watch him I don't know anybody that teaches it like this watch him now as old brother organ right said that not from the pulpit here is he but new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit the scripture doesn't support it I don't think see to my way of seeing it I believe that you're born again no brother Brad what do you say it well brother out of sure hid that one because you you said all the whole time that the born-again experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the new birth is one in the same that's exactly what he just said he just said that short don't sound like it well let's go some further then beings you think that much of it let's go some more number 20 that was the key to the door priest is 62 this is why I'm against organized religion piece of 62 and this is after the the statue of perfect man was preached now listen let's that thing that other one was to be able to keep through the doors after it - is that right I believe that's right we'll get it in a minute he's bringing it down and trying to explain something and look what he says I never thought there was a person believed that like me till this morning I heard charged fuller as I was going down he believes too that the new birth is not the baptism of the holy God the new birth is being born again the Holy Ghost is the baptism brother branham's just say it that's what I'm saying you won't read it you read it little brown just said the baptism when the Holy Ghost a new birth and the born-again experience is all the same he just said that but can you read that go ahead questions and answers on Hebrews 1957 and by one spirit we're all baptized into one body that's correct the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different is a different act from the new birth one is a birth one is a baptism one brings you eternal life the other one gives you power it gives power into eternal I see to operate now you got it he just said the new birth the born-again experience the baptism when hole goes and one more sign can you read it go ahead you must be born again 1961 this would have been before the stature of perfectly come here 62 I think 318 ugly that's right now I want to say this to the pastor's that will perhaps receive this tape I suppose maybe just a little different from what the regular Church teaches it I teach and believe and believe can sufficiently prove by the scriptures that you're born of the Spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit again he's saying the new birth the born-again experience the baptism with the Holy Ghost is the same can you read it man you got us okay go ahead to the next one this is still over you must be born again 23 I remember what he said I teach them to believe that you're born to the spirit then baptized into the body not the Holy Spirit that's exactly the statue of a perfect man that's exactly what he's taught in the message the statue of a perfect man go ahead to the 23 you must be born again he's talking about you couldn't pull it back no matter what happened that Souls got to be changed here born again you say what about the Holy Ghost brother branham the Holy Ghost baptizes you into the body for service but you believe unto eternal life he they hear of my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life then you're baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body for manifestations of the gifts and so forth but you believe to eternal life he that believeth has eternal life and you believe when you're dead and are born regenerated a new creature that's when you really believe I still saying the same thing statue a perfect man this is you're born again at faith that's what he's explaining you're the next one the back to the key to the door I think yeah you believe in to eternal life and are born again by your faith jesus said in st. John 5:24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life not the Holy Ghost just has everlasting life he's born into the family of God and then baptized into the Holy Ghost with power of the intelligence of faith to believe the gospel and put it to work and make it act then he acts like the Son of God then he can cast out Devils to the next one questions and answers no when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you then have the new birth when you believe on the Lord you receive a new thought a new life but it isn't the baptism of the Holy Ghost see you got the new birth when you believe you got eternal life it's a gift of God this gift to you through Sovereign Grace by accepting the gift that God is giving to use it he that here at my words and believed on him that sent me hath eternal life has everlasting life that's the new birth you're converted it means you're turned around but the baptism of the Holy Spirit puts you into the body of Christ subject to the gifts for service what it doesn't make you any more of a Christian I know that's floating hard through the mind so I'll back up and say it the new birth that you receive right here at faith the headstone don't make you no greater Christian I don't mind saying it just puts you into the body of guilt now why one spirit were baptized firstly into one body that's it Paul gar different gifts and then this body is nine spiritual gifts in this but look you have to be baptized into a body and remember you Bab gets into the body with the baptism in the Holy Spirit right is that what he said over here now watch him you have to be baptized into the body to possess one of these gifts that was born again scarlet about repentance well guess is he talking about how about this quote the gifts without the virtues is a stumbling block to the unbeliever brother branham must have knowed what he's talking about because he says you got to be baptized into the body you really have one day yes outside of that it can be anointings it can be anything under the National countdown priest after statue of perfect man and the new birth is people taught that the baptism with Holy Ghost is the new birth now that's wrong the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the new birth he's still explaining the new birth the baptism when the Holy Ghost the born-again experience it's all the one thing you just st. reading look the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the new bar the new birth is when you're born again oh the new birth is when you're born again and he just explained you're born again at faith the new birth is when you're born again but the Holy Ghost is when power comes into that birth for service any times do you need this scripture you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you not before what but the Holy Ghost is when power comes into that birth for service that's the exactly see the Holy Ghost is baptized into the Holy Ghost the new birth you have the new birth by being believing on the Lord Jesus Christ see by having faith and accepting him as your Savior are we on the statue of perfect that's birth see because you PI's from death under life if you want to back that up take st. John 5:24 he that believeth in him that sent me has everlasting life he's got life because he believed and that same group had to go to Pentecost to be baptized with the Holy Ghost now it doesn't mean that they had to do it they had to go there to get to holy hood the Holy Ghost is power for service so when talk about you got to be born again and applying that to the Holy Ghost he's saying other people does it after the Holy Ghost is come upon you you already believed into eternal life so forth but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power what about it what about it either brother branham is teaching the same thing or we're massively confused either he's teaching the statue of a perfect man that you're born again at faith and then when you receive the faith of the father you receive the baptism when the Holy Ghost the father's did which is the word revealed and then we can be waiting on the headstone is why sure don't sound what I'm saying is reading I read them you can make him say anything you want him to say but everything I read just staying the same time well brother I sure didn't get it maybe you need to pray a little bit and say Lord was that prophet so massively confused that he taught us that the new birth the born-again experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost is one on the side then he turns around and says I can emphatic ly prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body see that's why we've got it all figured I'll look at the statue of a perfect man you're born again at faith each one of these is a virtue that you are baptized in to that sealed into you by the Holy Spirit from above welding it together bringing it down we remember the statute of a perfect man is not the statue of you it's the statue of the perfect man which is Christ Jesus in you so you're born again at faith and you're baptized into all of these things and what will be the headstone as we end it come on musician what'll be the headstone the prophet said one day they'll come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost from heaven that will feel every fiber of our being and take us in the rapture what are you looking for our brother Dale I'm looking for the faith of the fathers and that brings a baptism that brings it to word that we've gotten a word revealed and we're back to the faith of the fathers and even then it's just a place to be waiting for the headstone now I don't mind go ahead and tell me the way I believe it because you see folks I'll never believe at one time the headstone to the church you can believe it's this you can believe it's that you can put it here say if this but you don't tie it all together in one place I believe the headstone to the church is the opening of those seven seals because we remember now you say yeah but I believe in that this has got to happen and this has got to happen we got to get this message there ain't gonna argue with you I'm gonna just ask you where you got it because according to my understanding when I asked a man is sitting in my house one day and he was lambasted in the message and I said you believe that y'all going out beyond brother on him I said brother I won't ask you one question what can you preach to me pipes brother Brown I said because he's already preached to the future home right the prophets already preached this to the future home what can be passed to future home sure there's a message of here to be brought down to the endless of Ages all through that so we're not going to end it all but the point is those seals now my quoting brother Randall marriage and divorce was revealed in the seals what else was revealed in the seals and he said serpents he was revealed in the ceilings in serpent seed was preached in 1958 I'm just full hearted enough to believe what he says those seven seals contain the complete full plan of redemption so now if anything else you're expecting to happen it can't be redemption I'm sorry I'm blunt statements in fact if you're looking for something else in redemptive plan where are you going to get it from because the seals is the full plan of redemption I didn't say that your prophet said it I'm not against anybody in their beliefs and their thoughts what this is going to be no I've never been against anybody in that college I've always been the same line the same thoughts I don't mind even being blunt so you say well I'm expecting brother Branham to come back amen because he'll be the first one to resurrection I believe that always believe that well we're gonna have this we're gonna have that I've always believed we've got a 30 40 day time after the resurrection of the saints I guess you think for 30-40 days we're gonna call off two or three services because well we're just too tired or not Wingo house services I mean after the dead raised any come on you know I mean the dead raised and you're happy and rejoicing well I don't know where we'll go to church or not I'm too tired I just don't feel good now we ain't gonna be that way it's going to be 30 or 40 days or the greatest rejoicing that has ever been my brother branham said you'll look no then those people made it and what a happy time that'll be that's why I believe the same thing I've always believed I had to change it I just believe in a progressive understanding there won't make it a statement again so now everybody working huh I believe read a random talk the stature of a perfect man before he came to 62 he said himself he had just got up in the woods that scripture of faith virtue or knowledge temperance patient he said I just got this up in the woods on what I was going to preach on you want to stay to a midnight you want to go in to the old message called Intervale or why my people so talked about her what the title that changed its a much better Branham said in that message looking for a walk in instrumentalities maybe the words as a people that Jesus Christ would be living in before the change the statue of perfect man he says these virtues will have to be in the seven church ages as the church that will go in the rapture he said in these virtues have to be in the individual that will go in the rapture I didn't say that he did well brother Dale I just don't understand you've confused me because you read some statements that are totally contrary to what you stated over and over to us that the new birth the baptism with old ago in the morning an experience of self thing but the Prophet said it's wrong let's go out going to the Prophet so long I told you when I get through we'll see whose anchored in tomorrow I'll go see who was anchored you sure honey try to do no correction I read to you what he said yeah but he said that listen I believe the baptism believe you're born into the body across and then baptized in the body don't you realize what he's teaching adoption adoption that when a child has grown up and become to the maturity of the manifestation of the sons of God Romans 8 adoption is what he was teaching in his early men history go back and run it in your computer the first one I found was 1950 that he's preaching adoption I believe he grew up in grace and knowledge but I don't believe he was wrong when he says I can prove that you're born into the body and in baptized with the Holy Ghost I believe that's exactly right that's 1000% true because I believe in adoption that's down oh yeah number 6 in the sperm of anybody have an 8 there is a name I love to hear I love to sing it sounds like music in my ears a Swedish name I love Jesus oh how I love tea please oh how I love
