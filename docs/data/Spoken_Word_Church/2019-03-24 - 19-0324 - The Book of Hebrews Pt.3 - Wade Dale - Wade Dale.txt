========================================

all right now let's go to whatever gun he 20 Bruges once-daily Hebrews 1 Hebrews 1 we kind of got down to here so thank you brother Joe and Louise before taking over the last two Sundays I really appreciate that y'all get a great job Bob did a good job link did not last week so Aaron did a good job daddy what not that but thank you everybody for taking over and your prayers and your support because we had a good time over there too it was not playtime that's for sure we have a few days of rest but we did a lot of work so we right here before we stop we were talking about hmm the Sun God and son of man who were talking about here being made so much better than the angel that he F by inherited some obtained a more excellent name today so by inheritance he obtained a more excellent name than day so what name was that we know that was Jesus Christ I hate it right here no [Music] now the Bible says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever which is exactly the truth he always was but he didn't develop in our part of the country and I think in our funny story just went through my head about what they were interpreting for me about in dimensions dimensions they were interpreting as denominations I was saying dimensions they were saying denomination Oh dimensions so that your there's your bank there's your bank huh there's one for me yes [Music] for me no you just give forward one for your family don't be on Bobby all right what does MVP mean yeah that's that old to college oh well anyway okay okay but we're talking about Jesus Christ because it says as he has by inheritance by inheritance he obtained a more excellent name Sunday night so who is this name if Jesus Christ we know all heaven and earth to hold a family his name Jesus Christ but now I I don't think the Angels are named Jesus Christ they're created beings for worship but they are not the family of God and to have a family you got a family name Jesus Christ is our family name all having a nurse named that Jesus Christ with the Angels but since born to which of the Angels said he at any time he didn't say to the angel for unto which of the Angels he that's the question that Paul was riding under which of the Angels did he say that on my son he didn't never say that to an angel to a lot of flying angel that was created now we know that there's angels in the Bible that are messengers ministers but that's not what that's talking about could read the context for under which of the angels and he said in any City and many times aren't my son this day of our garden they know that's not for an angel right angels not begotten being you and I are begotten by the whole bottle of baptism with the Holy Ghost no man we are begotten by the new birth angels are not this day have I begotten thee what's Paul doing Paul's establishing that Jesus Christ is the head of all things and you and I are there with him and the angels he's so much better than the Angels but now remember with the scripture that says being made lower than the ain't well he was he became a flesh man he became lower than any angel to bring us up amen we know that that sucks that's just good old boy oh it's just good ol evangelistic preaching talk about salvation and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son he never looked at an angel and said you're my son he never not to an angel does he say then he says that to us but he said that to the first the first fruit good job good job good job because he was the first fruit what he was the he was the beginning of the creation of God he was the way God had to begin with that had they not been fall he came spoken word child Jesus Christ came spoken word child Christ was named Jesus when he was here on earth then you can say Jesus cook and then you here brother ground said well he never had another name that's he's actually true but you got to remember that name didn't develop here in this dimension until two thousand years ago when he was born because there was making dog so - that was me how bad I'm back - come brother oil was getting up attached from a brother hey Suz and he said ah Jesus is talking to me he hope don't were never saying that word right there hey loose till they have a Spanish background - so I said what Jesus talking to you an alien see ya Jesus is talking to me now so he taught me but people say suits hey-zeus Cristo is Jesus Christ there was a lot of Jesus's hey listen there was a lot of geodesy you reading the Bible there was a Judas not Iscariot right there was not a bad guy so it's what you're associated with anyway it's what makes the name bad so that's why the Lord Jesus Christ is we give Jesus all the titles that he needs the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we baptize and that family that puts us in the family of God not just Jesus but you can't baptize them Jesus only because there's many other jesus's but their Lord Jesus Christ right okay so he was made much more he made better than the Angels but remember he came down here became lower than the angel this flesh man the son of man but what to do bring us all back up because remember Jesus didn't come to bring us an inheritance he can't protect us back to our inheritance he had the inheritance inside of him but for him he had to die to make a way for us to get back all right he didn't develop down here and he was born Lord the Christ he was born Emmanuel God will see so he didn't gain hmm he ain't gaining gotcha he gained a name that the whole family of heaven and earth is named and that's the redemptive name of God yes see even Jehovah's not a name right remember one brother best and all them was having that argument in the 50s you know brother the old oak tree but the Bible says well what about the seven compound names at your home do they not directly affect you you know if you're talking about Jesus Christ and they have to say yes cuz any Bible scholar knows that that's not Jesus's name Jehovah is not God's name this is God's name okay but how clear that for us now that we see that to make sure that we know that and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son see the question mark called asking these questions and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world first begotten first fruit for a first person first begotten into the world this is the first time anybody was born the way they should have been born even Adam was not born at all he was a created me he was created a big man you know 20 year old guy Jesus had to come a baby to be our brother so he could take us back all right so Paul still asked asking these questions because the first part of that says God who is sending time to die with matter space time past the prophets had in these last days spoken us by son who has appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world so we know that Jesus Christ was the creator would know that but he didn't develop that name until he came here on earth to get all the redeemer Clark because that's how we and I are identified were identified by Lord Jesus Christ where I just identified by Jesus cuz they're from millions though but there's only one Lord Jesus Christ and now it's Christ in you the hope of glory that doesn't make you Jesus but I'm gonna read you a quote this afternoon where brother Branham makes it real close it needs to be because if not then you know you got a separation of people while we were they really caught all the little bits especially the ministers in the Philippines who were talking about that not being enough a second person of the Angels he said who made is his angel women and again when he brings in at first we got into the world he saying that all the angels God worship them and they did remember many times in the Bible Jesus Christ when he came out of his 40 day wilderness angels ministered to him he was provided by angels to tell him what was going on and that's the same way brother Branham was issued an angel whatever you want to say you but you were issued an angel and that angel sure is you know and I've already called everything in the world I've heard he called me if they ask me which I don't agree with that you are here at the often in your Angels knocked-up theophany that's a separate being that's near the help you because I'm gonna read it right down here are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation who are heirs of salvation all the redeemed okay all the reading I really thought somebody would have said I am me I am I am and they were present me mystic all right yes meet me is to know what use that terminology and again look many brands have personally got into the world all the engines were got a worsted member when he remember when he was born on earth what happened brother Brown said angels went to shepherds and announced the birth all right of who Jesus Christ and again when he brings in first one in the world said all the engines were sermon and on the angels he says who make this his angels spirits and his ministers flame a fire but unto the son he said say because the angel didn't get on a throne an angel is a spiritual being that God created for worship alright alright that killed some Yellowjackets but anyway but into the son he saith thy throne O God is for ever and ever alright died thrown a scepter which is the staff of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom good you're talking about Jesus Christ know about honor an angel alright ain't you good habit from the internet now the one devil the devil wants a throne yeah alright he's an angel to it but I hate to create a being he he cannot be redeemed he's not a he's not a human person say it's not human he's an angel right now he takes on forms like the Beast and all of different ones but he can't create a being and step into it that's his problem when Jesus came on earth God created the body and he just you just just I mean God just stepped right in the body and say it was like what in the world went on what happened here I can't do that I can annoy people but I cannot get my life in them you know thou has loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows are above the people I think what that means above the companions and thou Lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the worst now this is Paul expounding on who this person is and that award in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth because Jesus Christ remember his theophylline he doesn't ever look any different than what it was it's like a you know if he's eternal that's the f4u if he's eternal he's not even one second that's why that I am is so important if we continue on with the I am it's not an I was or I'm going to be yes I am ever-present for eternity when he said let there be light this man standing in theophany wherever you want to say he was standing now in the blackness of whatever having the I don't know but when he said let there be light that's the same guy that's living on the face of the earth you're right here or he's or he's two different people so he's not-- he's not a second older because when this man came down he came to be born in sin man blood born in sin Shaymin in iniquity no that's us he was born in a way we were born in other words through the wound but not by not my say but what did he do he came here to get us back to so he had to give this life that was inside of them and what's that like this inside of him he said before Abraham was I am yes okay so that's do that I am in it was inside this person and he never looked that's why when this guy that's when this guy comes out of the tomb his body has changed to the theophany is on the inside of him and that's when he was a 20-year old person god never has been gray-headed in the old and stooped over he's a twenty year old man never has he been [Music] okay yeah there is also something so you need to start thinking back in this room get back in the room I saw you you far-out look when you're looking through that wall like you're not even here let's pay attention to what we're doing here anyway that's why we have people come up to three weeks later and go I never heard that before brother Bill preached on 14 times and now the word in the beginning that's laid the foundation of the earth and heavens are the works of thy hand now this is Paul telling thou Lord thou Lord are the one that made all this right they shall perish but our maintenance heaven earth pass away my word see you got to remember when says in the beginning was the word he was though he was the embodiment of the word that's like I sell them in the Philippines all of all of Jesus's ministry was only three and a half years but look at the thousands and millions of sermons this came off of that just three nine years that this man lived on earth but you got to remember though the Old Testament every scripture talked about it right entitled n even in reality because there's one coming coming off it locked him to me that's going to come and do this thing but when he comes here now what what do we do now this week we go well Jesus is here and done his work you know we got all his old testing but we gotta know they said we're the continuation of that you and I are the only body as in this dimension yes did you see any of that that was over in the influent any of them did I show any of that because the brother was we were talking about dimensions for a few minutes and I was saying dimensions and he was saying denomination they taped it I think but anyway the brother was that was interpreted he kept saying dimensions he kept saying I heard him same denomination coach denomination is in every language is pretty much like hey man it's all this everybody says blah blah blah denomination but then I looked any brother else's now that's not it so I go through about five more minutes of dimensions and he goes denomination and I go stop hold on this is not a bit on that this is the main dumb vain chance and I finally figured out a word that everybody can understand so but we have a good time with they shall perish but our Manton and they all shall wax old that done the garment Paul saying in the beginning that I laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens of the works of thy hand they shall perish but our remains because he is literally the body body month of the word he was the Word made flesh right when he was standing against the ice why hits the often ease our word theophany that's why when you get born again you're theophany it's part of that come off of that atom second atom yes come off that second atom and now your bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh not a saying a person he was not a second person from Adam she was the same person right so that's what you're not gonna see that we're not there's not a separation we do what people have done separation to us the denomination has divided that's what a division is a common denominator being when they shall perish and as they fester or what piece of cloth right cloak shalt thou follow them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same with the years you'll never Jesus Christ this night this is the same man later on Hebrews 13 it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday them for everything went right but to which of the Angels said he at any time now he's back to this question again he's been asking questions he's been expounding on who God is now he's asking the question again but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies how close those he never felt said that to an angel he said back to Christ all right are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation so there's ministering spirits that come to you and I to help us do our life yes I believe that I really do you see the things that happens in your life and you go man but then other times you look and you go through things and your life you go man where'd he go I really needed a moment flap on Korean air when I five hours and it was no air conditioning at all it was just a heat bath I was sweating in places I've never swept for five hours sitting in one place yeah you know they always tell you to read the little pamphlet of how to get out when it's and nobody ever picks up reason I fan for five hours with him so I did have a purpose I won't never fly Korea an area and Delta lost my luggage there he's got tore up when I got my luggage day for you they a little like they grow you through the airport on this side Oh nobody's gonna take me anyway it was there was no there was nothing up here they said he came to a slim in the wall it was a little slit right down the side of the wall and I was sitting in a window seat something came through that one day what get what cold I started a school cream girl can i crack a window but anyway right there for now watch Paul saying that look I love Paul watching their forward now when if you know that he's a scholar and he said therefore so what he's done is all of verse one he is made of summation he has said what he thought about this person here all right went through a Street for questions and answered them and then he says therefore because if you we must read this without that number two they read that in a letter that he's roped so he's just continuing to write the scholars had broke these things off into chapters because he says therefore so what's he doing he's talking about one hang one he broke the first ever how many verses was that fourteen verses therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any times we should let them slip in other words for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression disobedient received a just recompense of the reward he's making a statement how shall we escape now what's he saying now here's the part that I'm good it's going to be a little tricky because angels are not redeemable we know that right but they must be able to make a choice because Park choose to go with the devil and vark choose to go right so they do have it the words spoken by angel with steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense recompense of reward in other words they're also going to be judged they'll have to be Bible says will judge angels right so now Paul what are you saying how shall we escape how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation no words if we turn it down it's far worse on us because we're human beings and we've got a choice to make then how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord when he was here as Jesus Christ and was confirmed unto us by them that heard he comes remember Paul did hearing Paul wasn't no Paul wasn't a part of Jesus's life in other words but he was confirmed to us by them that heard to him heard him God also bearing them witness who do come out the early disciples 120 in the upper round the ones that come down and James and Peter and all them because he wasn't a part of that he came on Luke you know several years later probably 20 years later before Paul even comes on the same and he's getting this information from the disciples but now remember too he's going to interject in him a little while that he went to the backside of the desert and God spoke to him and when he come back him and Peter was saying the same thing see that's the Holy Ghost bang witness God also banged them witness talking about the early disciples both with signs and wonders and with many miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own well foreign to the Angels has he not put in subjection the world to come you go back to what we were talking about Paul said unto the Angels what's Paul different Janey's first two chapters an angel Christ in you Christ was made better than the angel the angels are over here and then you're here you're the heirs of salvation let me just just read that because he never said it to an angel he never put the world under subjection to the act to an angel the world under subjection to Jesus Christ and us yes amen we're far into the angel angels he has he not put in subjection the world to come wherever we speak but one in a certain place testified Sam what is man so we get the man that thou art mindful of him or the Son of man that thou visitest him not an angel man thou madest him a little lower than the Angels so here we are he's telling us now thou madest him a little lower than the Angels now why because of us the only reason Christ came as a baby flesh baby person is because of us it's because of the sin curses because of what we did alright cuz I didn't have to do that look he was eternal he was the I am he was Jehovah honey he didn't have to do that but to bring his children back he had to do that and not angels he to put an angel 72 the work he put us but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him question work or on the son of man that thou visitest him so to become the son of man he had to be made Lord right there we put that eternal maybe we put that line up there blew this down here is dimensions this dimension wherein he came into this dimension as the son of man hmm he was not the son of man in the beginning the title cause he wasn't guarding human flesh yet this flesh the flesh he picked up he inherited a flesh that inherited eternal life hey man I've been reading the quotes 100 times gonna know exactly what I'm talking about he inherited eternal life in his flesh so that you can inherit eternal life you flex go we get what he gets if he gives somebody change we definitely get a body change alright yes what is man that thou visitest him thou madest him a little lower than the Angels what he brought him down here because remember an angel cannot just step into human flesh and becoming human no now God can take the two angels to Sodom and he can put flesh over room because he was one in control member male character that he was there he said come on Michael come on Gabriel you know what brother Graham gives us an example and he puts the body flesh on but they were not people they were not persons they were in human flesh because God put him in human flesh even God put a little human flesh but he wasn't this human flesh it wasn't milk Cassady that priesthood had to change because remember male calves today we don't see milk anything anymore we see who Jesus Christ the Melchizedek is not he's the high priests but he's not one this was made lower so that he could come into me and you Jesus Christ flesh is what we we hang on the son of man because that was the word make a leg that's right she wants the same with us yeah the word listen the word made of flesh in the Old Testament you understand the difference the word made of flesh called Melchizedek in the Old Testament but that wasn't the word made black this is the word made flesh but that was that was a word that created the flesh and then when he stepped out of this dimension the flesh just he just went right back to dust hey man but this one did indeed even see corruption all same time he hiding he planted him in the earth dead brother Brown I was reading last night cold dead in the grave brother Brown said Jesus and body was cold and dead not a specialised in it but when that the off break the off and he came right back in there he just stood right back up and every cell inside of his body literally changed to a twenty year old person that's what's gonna happen to mean you yes that's why Mary Magdalene didn't know who he was she never seen him at 18 20 years old right but when he but the voice she knew that voice when he said Mary she knew who he was that's why they have a problem isn't that's the whole secret that's why they have a problem with Jesus when he when he returned nobody in the in his full an inner circle of people remember that he was 30 years old when he started bringing this disciples in so nobody had seen him under 30 years old his mama was the only one of me today was already dead maybe his brother James about it but it wasn't the James in the Bible or the disciple James so no I had seen this man in 20 years of no one he was the secret life that what they call the solid years but remember a twenty years old when he stepped out of that tomb Peter didn't really know who he was I mean they really even come walk in the enemy says who are you you no need to give me some fashion and they still didn't believe you reading reading the Bible they still why cuz they see this 20 year old lamb this young guy where they saw this old man this guy looked 50 years old the Bible says he looked 50 all right look your brother branham I mean he was 56 when he died if you look at some of the pictures he looks so old because of the wear and tear of hit the ministry that he had then deep-set eyes it was the ministry that really broke him down you know in same way was Jesus Christ and brother Branham was not even respected dirt considered considering Jesus Christ when he was on earth he died for all but everybody sins he took the whole world on its own oh lordy look so old yeah but when he came by young that was to me that's the revelation that's so that's a hidden mystery that he came back a young man yes not an old guy right that was the mystery and then that's the same things gonna happen to us change us back thou made him a little lower than the Angels but now he gets a crown crowns him with glory and honor now what is the glory of Jesus Christ we are the glory of Jesus Christ was where his body yes okay and didn't stand him over the works of thy hands little urgency when he come out of the tomb he said all power and heaven earth given unto me he would be was on his way excuse me to really shift but he had to come back on the day of Pentecost that was a real rulership that's why I Pilate never had a problem with Jesus the king we're gonna this guy's a king we're gonna kill him we're gonna kill him before he becomes our king and pie looks like you don't look very kingly to me you know looks like we just beat him to pieces and you know he was a Roman guy he says I don't think probably all bony and skinny and everything else and he said hey he's no threat to me and Jesus even told him he asked Jesus he said are you gonna establish a kingdom here and he said if my kingdom was a this was no word of my kingdom not of this world my kingdoms of nowhere I was like hey you haven't any more else you just trying to have it here you know so he just really turned him loose but you know what the Jews did they didn't want him to be the king so they want to kill your honor these secular works not him now let's put all things in subjection under his feet now what's Paul saying everything is put under Jesus Christ now we've got everything we need right here this is the man he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not all things but under him now what was once Paul saying he's still matter buddy yeah because Paul knew his body was getting old but now he knew he's the very preacher that said we plant them in corruption and we raised him in in corruption so he knew there was the body Tang's coming but we don't see all things put under him we don't when he took a body change and came out of that tomb that was for all of us the whole 2,000 years of Christian Dome of the seven churches that changed everybody's body but if brother Graham remember brother Graham said it wasn't applied yet it's not applied for the end time when the son of man comes back in human flesh to do want to change the body all right that's the whole key people think people things that were just in a message that one day our bodies just change it's not it's the word that we got inside of this is what's gonna change our body the man believed in Paul I mean I'm sure Paul long before man he was getting on up there he was getting beat 39 stripes - one several times so I guess he was ready for it - you know he was getting ready to go to the chopping block not too far after this so but now we see not all things yet all things put under him in other words Paul of doubting them in the field it's all great great markers but he knows that this guy this guy took care of all that when he come out when he resurrected everything was studied under his feet because Jesus said all power in him when there's been given unto me in other words boom everything was put but where's the feet of Jesus right now thank you thank you I am the feet of Jesus now you and I it's what's got to come to that place then all the things except you cook left when we take a body change what's left when we come to a place that we can call and speak in the dead come out of the ground and they come among us and then God changes our body what's left all things then have been put under his feet and he's not here right now he's walking in our feet okay so he's doing it through us because watch what did Paul say Paul said I know something's coming he said but let me sum all this up right here but we see Jesus he knows Jesus came out of that tomb and ascended and came back on their Pentecost because he was a recipient not at Pentecost but he was a recipient of the same Holy Ghost they received on the day of Pentecost so he could speak this but we see Jesus who has made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death well who suffered death this man right this man didn't the often II God never suffered suffered death but when Jesus came on earth he had that the often inside of him the offering of God inside of him and he couldn't get out because it was there was a shell it was it was something like a capsule that was that was encased around that eternal life so he had to break that at Calvary to release the life to come back only in you so Jesus didn't come to Branson inheritance he brought the inheritance with him he made us a way to get back to the inheritance all right cuz remember if he developed an inheritance down here it's not eternal we're looking at an eternal inheritance all right now but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it and come him who Jesus for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering anybody okay with that perfect through suffering come remember he was perfected let's see what that says complain because really brotherbrother said jesus is not what complete without you so this Jehovah person up here was not complete without a bride yes he wasn't complete that's why he went through the Old Testament doing all he could through the prophets trying to get people to see him but there was a barrier there of blood of bulls and goats not a man's life that was keeping him away you couldn't even open the holy of holies and if you looked at it you died but they looked at it for 30-something years they look this is a very man that was inside that right inside of the Holy of Holies I was looking around at him he became flesh that's why now we can go bowmen to the throne cuz where's the throne the throne Jesus Christ Rowan's not a throne he set up the throne of Jesus Christ for it became him for whom are all things about número things in bringing many sons and the glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering from both he that sanctifies alright and they who are sanctified are all of two well that looks like two he and they read your Bible he and they but the Bible says are all of one that's right for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren and the heads of the church will I sing praises unto thee we'll stop right here and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me a man for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same what flesh and blood that through death he might destroy him that had the death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage everybody was put under bondage of a thing called death and it has conquered temporarily everybody until the day were standing here so and that's let's go see what it says shoved you to slavery Wow that word cuz look verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of Abraham who you and I are all right let's stop right here will actually stop [Music]
