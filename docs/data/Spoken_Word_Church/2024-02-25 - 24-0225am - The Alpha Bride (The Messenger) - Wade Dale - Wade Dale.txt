Saturday we appreciate everybody that participated and and uh help put that thing on we we're um appreciative of everyone um brother Lis will be speaking for us Wednesday night where's Sister Christine she sick oh man pray for themen uh also brother John dared will be speaking this afternoon and um then this coming Saturday we'll be doing questions and answers I have two more two questions but uh if you have any more bring them uh we'll start at 5:00 with the prayer service and then um remember Mom and Dad that getting over I know all of you know that uh about the whole family except me and and uh Terence and Lisa and their family in June didn't get covid but we've been around it and swimming in it so uh we appreciate you prayers for for Mom and Dad that uh and I think he's going to be able to come home today uh his white blood cell count's still up but we're still praying we still believe in a miracle working God we still believe that God's on the scene he hadn't left us he said he'd never leave us he'd never forsake us even in the darkest hour you know sometimes you can think we think back and what happened with with that and different ones and last night we were watching uh brother Ron Spencer I know most of you all know him and he's been fighting cancer now for they told him two years ago he had four months so but he stood before his congregation last Sunday night and told him he had two months you think you got problems that's what's facing him but you know what they said that two years ago that's right but it's Advanced into his eyes and and he just looked at his congregation and and and the way that same way that I feel that we watched a lot of you grow up he W he dedicated a lot of babies and then he dedicated a lot of babies of the babies that he dedicated he buried some he brought some in and he over he looked them looked at him and he said when you think you got problems just remember me but he preached like he never preached before he preached on the duel u e l The Duel guess who wins The Duel every time you can rewind it as many times as you want to God wins you rewind it again it's like the turtle in the hair you can read every book you want to uh of the different uh different writers or different copies of it and turtle always wins God always wins he will not be defeated uh it's a dark hour for for a lot of people but God's still on the scene and God's still in control sir and we believe that God's here to answer your prayer today and we're going to talk about that first church today we're going to talk about a little bit about the messenger but we're going to talk about that first church how they stood persecution uh they stood um the religious group of the day that wanted to kill them and they killed all the all the uh all the disciples except for John they died very shortly after Jesus after Jesus went off the scene because of their stand for God Amen so now if the alpha bride's that way then the Omega Brides coming to a time that where even brother Ry says that they will kill your influence they don't have to kill you and you you know die or personal death but but you can have your influence killed but you can also have your influence raised up as with John and different ones that come went to the aisle of patmas and and God wanted him to write down and send it to the churches so we're part of that church I mean we're we're in lay of see I know we're not part of it but we get the good and we get the bad that's right all right so we're here today to um to tell you that we love you we thank him next Sunday you pray you pray and you pray some more if you don't have a prayer closet build one all right serious serious for all of us but we love you with the love of the Lord and thank you so much I I ask U I ask Dad in March we were sitting on a porch and this was before that uh he became a little bit uh incoherent and and um we were sitting there and and and I I looked at him I said hey look at me he looked at me and I said if you're ready to come back I said you let me know if you're ready to come we'll open everything we can open up to get you here he said no I'm not ready and I'll not tell you what he said after that that was personal to me but he said I'm not ready he said I'm not ready to come back so and and listen we pray all the time God raise raise him up we need people like that we need the the older group brother collie brother Dy and different ones that stood in in the in the the bushes and kick back to bushes just so that we can have a a better place and a better opportunity to serve the Lord amen think about it we've had a lot of Warriors leave the place too you know a lot of Warriors have left and the Warriors that have left they had something to do with yes sir everything that goes on in the whole functioning of the church the whole function of your life and my life we live together yes amen a real true Ministry like us we live with the people we don't just pop in and preach that's an evangelist Brother David Gman popped in he preaches does a real good job did the best job I ever heard him last Sunday actually I told him that but he goes off and does that somewhere else but but when you take the other part of the fivefold ministry you have to live with the people you have to be here with you and and be sorrowful when you're sorrowful be happy when you're happy and then be happy when you're sorrowful okay so um just remember all that also on the 10th and I want to appreciate uh the song leaders uh brother Joe Canada um we had a last week they had a meeting with all the musicians and the song leaders and I believe that as brother Joe said the first of the year that whatever we've got that I said to let it out last year let's show the world let's show let's show worship now let's worship God the Bible says in spirit and in truth all right you got two of them you got to put together spirit and truth I believe we have those now now let's use them use your gift God give you a gift no I don't he give you a gift right he gave you two hands if you can't say a word you can lift your hands to the one that saved your soul and baptize you with the Holy Ghost and give you a part of his own life those people in the first church age they weren like you guys come on now they didn't come driving up in a in a Cadillac right and and if they didn't want to go to church they could sit and watch it on the internet if they weren a church they didn't get it what' Paul say well you weren't there I ain't telling you go listen go listen go listen they had to listen Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God I know some of you can't come some people can't come to church but but the ones that can you remember them people back in the early days and you know what they survived and they you know what they they pushed that message all over the world without any internet without a cell phone without a computer they got it to the whole world God's going to have yes sir his way he's going to get to his last seed he's going to get to me and you whether we don't want to or not he's going to have his group of people and I just we're one of them amen uh remember we won't have communion now next Sunday because that'll be first Sunday but we'll have the the process that brother Bob was talking about you give brother Bob and brother Terrence and brother Ryan a good hand and the ministers here for U for coming together but we'll have communion on the 10th which will be the second Sunday not not next Sunday but the next Sunday all right it'll be on the 10th and also remember on that same day we'll have a service the second service will be a I'll speak for a little bit about what brother R said about worship and what the Bible says about worship and then we will um get with brother Joe about songs and things that you want want to work on musicians and song leaders we we have to have worship it doesn't take precedence to the word come on but it is absolutely important absolutely important to have that worship to I you know I'm sorry you're standing but David Saul had some bad spirits on him right Saul turn around and look at somebody and say Saul s had some bad spirits on him see there got y'all and what happened was David didn't come in and say now Saul blessed God you shouldn't be doing this he came in and sat down with a harp and he started playing heart Maybe started singing some of the Psalms that we that brother collie and and the responsive reading uh brothers and start playing the harp and what the Bible say those evil spirits left Saul all right Saul turn around look at each other and said those evil spirits left Saul all right God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord thank you so much for uh for being part of this so let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we we love you Lord and we thank you for the opportunity to stand before the greatest people that ever hit the face of the earth oh to the world we we're insignificant we don't mean anything and we're just quacks and Cs and we believe this different Doctrine and we have this different idea and we live different we act different we talk different praise God that we are separated that you separated us from the world and the things of the world that will not come into that condemnation that the world is going to have Lord that we'll be carried away from this place in a moment in the twinkling of an eye father that's what we're heading toward lord it's not something Lord that's that's too far away I don't believe Lord I believe it's coming Lord in in in fast fast manner and father I pray that we not get left behind and as brother Dell always said I hope we're not at the train station with a plane ticket Lord I pray that we're at this place that we need with the ticket that we need to get on board to get out of here father forgive us of our sins bless us Lord be the ones that are sick dad different ones mom and Lily and uh all the ones are sick Lord I pray that You' touch their body Lord You Are the Healer you're doing it anyway you're healing through the body and people don't even believe you and you're still healing them Lord thank you for that father thank you for being merciful thank you for grace and thank you for the love that you bestowed upon your people father we ask these things in Jesus name amen and we'll try to get to the messenger but the alpha bride I've kind of got a little something I want to I want to bring to you because remember that Alpha bride whatever that Alpha bride is that's what we are supposed to be Mirror Image but now remember we have a plus plus the opening of the seals plus the body change that we're requireed ired to come to that they weren't required to come to all right so we have everything plus not plus another messenger plus another Bible plus another no it's more Revelation being revealed to us than it was to them all right Revelations one ver10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest right in the book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia the Ephesus Smyrna pamas thyra Sardis Philadelphia and L out a sip and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the paps with the golden girdle Revelations 1:16 you can be seated and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword as we were talking about the other day God is going to make sure we get the right right message amen from the right person because he holds those seven stars in his hand not in a bishop hand not in an Elder's hand he holds not even in an angel's hand that's right he holds it in his hand and we're going to see in just a minute that truly when God unfolds himself through those prophets or Messengers it is the logos or the speech of almighty God coming through them that's why we call it the voice of God in the end time all right well we could call it the voice of God if we needed to back in Paul's time irenius Martin Columban all the different ones all right but he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth with a sharp two-edged sword so in other words he didn't just have the stars in his hand he had them there for a purpose there was something going to come forth from them which was a sharp two-edged sword which we know is the word of God all right not man's ideas but the word of God for the people that need it for the day and hour that they're living in all right cuz remember Luther's message will not do us any good we love the Lord we we we love justification but justification in its baby form won't even get you to be bride but it did for hundreds of thousands of them back in Luther's day but remember God comes on through as we were reading the other day the life comes from the seed to the stop to the shook to the tussel all the way out to produce corn again well we at to producing corn again to look like the original ybody with me Revelations 1:20 the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou saw us in see God thought so much of this mystery he didn't leave it open-ended he told you what they were right the Seven Stars are the Angels and the Seven candlesticks are the seven churches so he pretty much took all man's ideas out and said this is this and this is this all right and I've got them all in my hand I'm standing in the midst of them I'm going to do this there's nobody else going to do now Satan's going to come in and try to muddle it all up and he knew that but he's going to have a bride everybody with me so that means he was in the midst of the church or the middle or amongst the church Amos 5:8 even tells us that seek him that maketh the Seven Stars and a now we see the Seven Stars is who he hold in his hand and there's a message behind that with with oy but we'll wait a little bit later on with that and turth the shadow of death into the morning when God sends a messenger on the scene it's life amen it's it's light it's to get rid of the darkness that come in from the people and maketh the day dark with night that calleth for the Waters of the sea and porth them out upon the face of the Earth the Lord is his name so the seven Church ages remember is a complete and final revelation of Jesus Christ to the Gentile Nations now he's not the final Revelation to the Jews he's not the final Revelation to the foolish virgin he's not over there yet that he's got to be revealed to them yes all right but to you and I as a gentile Nation when the seven Church ages are complete for us the bride takes her last call we're sealed in everybody else is sealed out and we're going to a marriage supper all right and that's the nation that you and I are in right now we're in God's Nation today by the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right and it started all new and I I was thinking about this the other day it was a new concept you know I say concept Loosely but it was something new when when when even when John the Baptist stood and said Behold the Lamb of God well the the priests were going they were looking for a lamb right cuz that's what they're used to they weren't used to God being in human flesh come on somebody so it was all new to them that's why John had to be so adamant he said hey you vipers you snakes yes you're holding this from the people there's your Messiah the one you're asking for he's standing right there plain view so it was new that's why there had to be a new as Paul says in Hebrews 10 a new dispensation or a New and Living Way there had to be a a New and Living Way coming from Luther coming from Wesley coming from Pentecost to this end time all right which he has cons consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh so there something came on on the scene called The Flesh of God right the Flesh of animals was before I was telling them at work they were talking about Jesus and and the new movie called Chosen and and and I like it cuz it it kind of humanizes the Lord and um I appreciate them doing it that way but they were talking about the New Testament New Testament I said you know me I said that movie wasn't made in the new test that movie was made in the Old Testament and they're like you know how they go I said let's read Hebrews 9 verse1 14 amen cuz there's something new when Jesus held that cup up he said this is the New Testament in my blood so the book of Acts would be your first book of the New Testament Matthew Martin Luke and John is a commentary or a or are a um um I guess you might say a story not a story it's true but it's four different people telling you four different things sometimes come on now all right that's right right all right all y'all I believe all of you today got the Holy Ghost all right we're going to use this in the in the uh when we get to the uh Alpha bride everybody's in here I believe F filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost how many of you drove a Chevrolet to work to church today don't be ashamed you Chevrolet drivers Ford there's prayer Toyota Nissan but you all came to the same place we had one common goal they had one common goal in the old test in the in not Old Testament in the first church age was to get this new testament or this new way this New and Living Way uh man I think about the Ethiopian unit he's he's sitting on his Chariot and they what I mean he was a man of status he wasn't in a buggy or or or o cart he was in a chariot and he had picked up a message book somewhere and he was reading it and what did it take it took somebody that had the Holy Ghost for God to send Phil and he says tell me is this talking about this guy or is it talking about this guy he was in the Old Testament pH let me explain to you just like what Steven did now but Steven Steven's a little bit different we'll get to him a little bit later but remember Steven got killed for what he preached but when he started out he was among all the Sanhedrin and he's telling them hey The Ten Commandments didn't come right here the Ten Commandments was out in the desert he's telling them all these things were out here out here out here and we've missed a lot of things in there and they're going you know like most of you you going yeah that's right praise the Lord amen amen but you killed him you killed him you crucified him and you killed him what the Bible say they nasted at their heart and they got so mad at him they killed him right they physically bashed his head in because of what he was different he was showing them a New and Living Way but praise God before he died died Steven looks up in heaven he says father don't lay this to their charge because there was a guy standing there his name was sa he was holding their coats he consented to what was going on but God was going to use that guy listen go through the Bible there is not one of you would pick anybody that God picked in the Bible to do his work would you pick Moses murderer run away from God HD for 40 years huh would you P David murderer liar a doter would you pick shamgar would you would have picked anybody you want would you pick Paul we're going to read here just a little bit about the messenger when this messenger first started out he Pur persecuted the people he preached to and I'll promise you when anas when God said anas there's a man coming to your house his name is Saul and is like oh hold on a minute but you know what he obeyed what God said that's the key I want you all to see in that first church age they obeyed what God told them and they did what God said listen even though ion was looking at at when Saul comes in and he looks he's he's thinking in his mind that man put my mama in prison that man had my grandmother and grandfather killed but Saul you've been chos and he laid his hands on him and he got filled with the Holy Ghost Hebrews 9 ver14 how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience and their cons ious could not be purged in the Old Testament it can only be forgiven they reply they you know they they just the lamb was it and then you just went out and did what you wanted to not anymore but it C it couldn't Purge your dead your conscience from dead works and for this cause he is a mediator so in other words of the New Testament that by means of death because remember he had to Die the testator has to die before a New Testament comes into force all right is everybody with me so the first testament was what the Old Testament uh for the Redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost we know that for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead so Jesus had to die to start a new testament all right everybody with me it says look it is it is of no strength while he's here let me tell you something Jesus didn't save one person while he was walking on the Earth but he's a savior of the world Amen they didn't understand him he had to come back in this new way through a group of people called his bride and called as we are looking now at Bishops Elders Paul set the church up the way God wanted it set up not the way he wanted it set up all right so each age had his message and his messenger all through the times every age has packed his message with a messenger god in every dispensation has sent forth someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age every time and I want to reiterate for all these idiots that are on the internet that are saying brother random was not him he was not Mali for then God you got to send me somebody and you got to send him to me quick before the great and dareful day of the Lord because you promised it well I declare to you today he's already sinning Jesus came and they never who knew who he was and they were looking for him here's the plan of it here's what I want to break this down for you a little bit before we get get into it the first thing happens there's an announcement in heaven brother r on the first seal he's telling you how each Church age is set up now listen I want to ask you one more time does God ever make a mistake God ever lie does God ever have to say oops does God ever redo he's perfect the first time so whatever he says that's what we do all right so now look what happened a seal is opened what is that a mystery is unfolded see when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds and we know what a trumpet is it's a message it declares a war as brother Ron was preaching last Sunday a duel between right and wrong as brother Chris Long preached a couple years ago go about the conflict between God and Satan well the conflict between God and Satan is not God and Satan it's you our plague Falls and the church AE open listen why did God send a messenger cuz he had bride he had bride sent out there in the world he had bride sent in churches he had bride that were that were blinded as he was blinded that's right or a plague falls in the church age is open what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery and I want you to put that in the back of your mind when we get to Paul and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him he goes forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to declare that message and what does it start a war it starts a spiritual war as also like Paul did the same thing and so did stepen Paul got up before griin all the different ones right and he preached him a sermon well listen brother Brandon was the same thing he went to the Pentecostal people people they pulled on the signs they pulled on the gift they pulled on the Wonders but when he turned to the Pentecostals and he said you've lost your first love you've got away from this that speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost what happened they nashed at their teeth and they did what they did what they did with Steven they killed his influence and they killed the man same thing it's the same Spirit folks I'm telling you the same spirit says here today as it was then then God takes his message with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep then he drops a plague upon them who rejected it a temporary judgment and then after that is over then he goes on and they denominate bring in denominations and start off with that man's work of Luther and the rest of them it gets into scrapple again in other words false Doctrine and then another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on Earth for a church age now listen we're not looking for another one this is it and when he arrives the trumpet sounds he declares war then what happens finally he's caught away and when he's laid away a plague Falls destroys them spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group now let me break that down for you real quick right here there's an announcement in heaven now we don't hear this announcement God has one person picked out Paul arenus Martin Columba Luther Wesley and William brandom everybody with me all right he knows that they don't yet listen Saul like I said before would you have pick Paul to write 80% of the Bible of the New Testament he was making people blasphemed he was putting them in prison he was having them put in there where they were put on The Gallows and killed he was making them do it right he was zealous oh give me that piece of paper I'm going to Damascus and I'm going to tear that church up well he got tore up for before he got there praise God he got blinded God smoted him blind and said hey you you're going to have to listen to one of my people you going to have to listen to anas to get them scales off your eyes so there's an announcement in heaven so out of the mind of God comes the logos a sealed up message is open in other words God's got it in his mind he knows he's going to have the church ages he knows that he's willing and able to do that but there's a group that's willing and able to receive it there's got to be work on both ends right that's like you pulling on the gift of God if you don't pull today that we're just going to muddle through and and plow as much as we can plow but if you'll pull on the gift of God and Saul get rid of them demons that you brought in here hello somebody I did too might as well be honest a sealed up message is open Paul steps on the scene he goes man I persecuted him but now I love him that's right I drove them to blaspheme now I'm trying my best to preach every day The unsearchable Riches of Jesus Christ so a mystery is unfolded to the star of the age in other words the messenger picks up the logos of God all right brother brandham he comes and and he's sitting in a cave and this Angel steps out of the light and he says I've been sent from the presence of God to bring you this message that you're going to do this and that and the other right that was a messenger sent from God and brother R fulfilled it he was not disobedient as Paul said to the heavenly vision praise God for that so the messenger picks up the logos of God in other words picks up the T the mind of God see what these people are doing when they're saying brother ranam was wrong they're saying God was wrong I don't want to be them on Judgment Day I do not so then a trumpet sounds so the messenger steps out and Paul declares and I'll read you in a few minutes he was pretty bold in declaring who he was if a messenger or an angel comes from heaven and preaches any other thing and you hear from me let him be a curse he said that twice he said you've come and you've you you've spoke these great beautiful words he said but it's added nothing to my Revelation we'll read that here in just a few minutes but it starts a message is proclaimed a church age begins in other words the people that SP supp to hear it start to hear it all right a church age begins a distinct and declared message for your time all right and it starts a spiritual war what Satan FS the pull of the righteous and he said I got to get into that I got to get into that and let Him worship me I want him to worship me not worship him they're worshiping oh my goodness let me just add a little bit in here a little bit in here and that's what happened right but praise God that's not going to happen in this age somebody's going to be the true word of God no false Doctrine so then the messenger brings his message he's laid Away Paul got his head chopped off all the different ones uh some of them were abruptly uh you know taken off the scene especially the 11 of the disciples were taken off the scene by hanging them upside down and pulling them apart and cutting their head off and all these different things we think we got problems yeah right to be killed for what you believe you have not done that yet so The Messengers is laid away or taken off the earth now look when they're taking off the Earth thank God we've had a prophet in the end time that when he was taken off the Earth we still have his voice amen we still have his 1100 sermons that he has that we can listen and we can go back but it's not just the books and tapes that's going to save you the books and tapes are not going to make you a mature Christian that's right it takes a five-fold Ministry because look if people didn't accept what Paul said because Paul would preach and then he would leave he was an apostle he set up a church and he well what Paul say by the word of the Lord I tell you this is what Paul said and by the Holy Ghost they had inside of them they believed it or if they didn't have the Holy Ghost they were pricked in their heart and there was a connection and that the way okay never mind so people accept it or reject it in every age there's people that accept it and people that reject it and then a temporary judgment or a plague spiritual death to the ones who reject their messenger so when brother randam was taken off the scene abruptly he was 56 years old but listen and I say this lightly when God's finished with somebody he don't dilly dally around he takes them off you prove me wrong he's never let people go like Paul didn't continue on into Iranian his age no he don't bring two messages at the same time remember he stops one takes them off the scene brings one right on the scene and continues right on that's the way God said it and that's the way I believe it so spiritual death to the ones who reject their messenger well now brother R stood and he said there's 969 different denominations you've heard him on the tape if you've listened 969 Google how many there are today 13,000 and I did this several months ago so there's 14,000 maybe 13,000 different ideas to this right here that's right 969 when he was alive when God took the messenger off the scene and laid him away the people accepted it or rejected it when they rejected it what' they do they went into denominationalism they went into their own ideas they dead Bible says twice plucked up by the root my brother brand he didn't hate the people he hated the system that had begun but remember the system if you are part of the system you're part of the system that's why we don't want to be a part of that system we want to be a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ set apart from that spiritual death so then what happens then the messenger now the messenger goes off the scene and we'll realize here in the Middle Ages that Columba died before his church AE started so the message of Columba had to be preserved where and maybe a little bit writing down cuz he was in the middle of the Dark Ages maybe a little bit writing down what Columbus say well he said and the message continued on they didn't need a book or a tape don't get quiet on me do we need a quote for everything we say we need need the Bible but we don't need a quote like brother George Smith I was watching him uh he was down at brother Jason Watkins and Lord he pulled that stinking ruler out I mean that level and he laid it on the thing you know it's about this long cuz he preaches balance and he's you know what he's about the only one left this brother Jason was talking about he's about the only one left that was old enough to know brother brandham cuz remember he married his daughter but brother B Paul's gone Brother Joseph was a little bitty boy he was the only one of the only adult that really saw and and brother George told us many many times he said soon as brother Ram left the Earth he said those people were a bunch of quacks and they just started right and left started leaving why it was for us it was for the people that would listen to the voice of God not the voice of William brandom but the voice of God to me and you behold I sent you Elijah the prophet I didn't send him to the world I sent him to you and I rever that he's not my God but listen without brother random we'd be in deep trouble deep trouble what would we do drive a Chevrolet drive a Ford but we go somewhere else we be driving I think we need to go over this way that's why I'm sorry folks that you need leadership in the church why would you bring somebody like you watch a movie about Robert El Lee he comes up you know and he's got 50,000 men out there in front of him getting ready to go to Gettysburg he's the captain they are going to battle knowing that probably 30% of them are not going to make it back and he knows that probably 30% of them is not going to make it back they actually were sewing their they sewed their names inside their coats in case they died they didn't know who they were because there's no such thing as a driver's license social security card and all that other stuff so if you died on the battlefield they had you had to to know your name there was no other registry maybe they had a registry in Washington or somewhere but here he is standing what if what if 10,000 said well now I think I'm going to go over here and me and and pick it we're going to go oh and we're going to go over this way and then Long Street says no no no no no no no don't listen to him we're going over this way well they really got their rear end beat they got it beat pretty bad anyway but there had to be one General and he know what he took the blame I love that part of the movie when they came back through the woods and and and Robert El Le is this he's just distraught he just knew he could go right through that right through that wedge of the front people of the of the north and he believed that cuz he sent people to their death but them guys come back and they didn't point up and say I told you this wasn't going to happen no they come back and said Captain give us one more time give us one more chance we'll go we'll go one more time now that's a real group of people amen that's a real group of people that believe so much in a cause do you believe so much in a cause today that you give your life for it I do so next day it's come there was an announcement in heaven same thing out of the mind of God comes a logos a sealed message is opened up a mystery is unfolded to the star of that age the messenger picks up the logos of God and what does he do he proclaims that message and then it takes a five-fold Ministry according to God according to the Bible it takes a five-fold Ministry to receive that from the messenger and break it down to the people not break it off amen break it down to the people Revelations 1 ver8 says I am Alpha and Oma the beginning and the ending sayith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty so the day of Pentecost started in 830 the day of Pentecost I like what brother Donnie Ragan said the other day he's kind preaching there's about four people preach preaching on the same thing of the early church and um he said now God didn't God didn't say well I'll just pour out the Holy Ghost any time he had a distinct time to do it now God said Jesus said go to Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high amen right remember brother Brown said about 10 days into it or five days into it they're like I think we got it I think I think no no we don't have it cuz we still act the same way we did before for come on somebody that's how you know if you got it or don't got it so the day Pentecost Penta 50 days on the day of Pentecost there was a feast there was a feast of the Holy Ghost falling on 12 120 people and what a feast day that was there hadn't been a Pentecost since that but we're now living in that Pentecostal Feast so ad30 now the church age didn't start till 856 so there was a Pentecostal age or the beginning of the alpha Church in that called Ephesus but it began with a day of Pentecost then they took the message and I'll read it to you in just a little while where where Paul he he he says I should have been back there I was born out of due season brother R said the same identical thing 1950 on that movie that they made he said I was born out of due time to you Pentecostal people in other words I should have been born and been in your 1906 isua Street no he was just Desiring to be that way but that's not the way God wanted it all right so the alpha Church started with a day of Pentecost where the Holy Ghost fell no Messenger to the age the Holy Ghost fell Peter listen Peter was the spokesperson he wasn't the messenger right there's a difference everybody with me all right God didn't pick Peter he picked Saul but by the time he had Peter out here to have the keys to open up the door Saul was closing the door and killing him would you have picked him I didn't think so we would have probably pick Judas hello somebody I'll wake you up you say the word Judas and they go we would have pick Judas he was the Slick guy the guy that's always got the money here and he's always got this in control and that in anyway but here's Peter naked half the time cussing fighting cutting people's ears off lying to the Lord would you have pick him didn't think so I'm glad I'm not God cuz they were the perfect pick for the perfect time for the perfect AG that we're in cuz remember God don't make a mistake okay if he picked Peter to do what he did he picked Peter to open the door but he sent Paul to be the messenger to the church age all right and we'll look here right here now look on the day of Pentecost here in this age 1906a Street he did not pick a messenger he picked a spokesperson the one ey black man all right read read it read it it'll tell you he was the spearhead but he wasn't The Messengers of the age right the messenger of the age actually wasn't even born yet brother Ram was born in 1909 so see they started that isua street Mission with the oneeyed black man and then they continued on and then brother brandham was born and from 1909 to 1947 we don't hear anything about brother brandham not much we know he preached some but we know one time for sure he told us and I thank God for a prophet that's honest enough to tell us that he waxed his car and washed it on Sunday and watched it them church people go to church but boy when the Holy Ghost got a hold of him he preached against them people that was washing their car not going to church but the day of Pentecost in our age though there was no messeng to the age we'll read that in in the uh Church in the seal book way away from now when we get to lay out of sea so the first AG the alpha age started with an day of Pentecost during the age of Pentecost with no messenger but a spokesperson all right then the messenger comes on the scen 1906 Isa Street the gifts come back the Holy Ghost fell in 1906 Isa Street and that if y'all don't know that that's in California started in the East ended up in the west and isusa Street do you know what that you know why they named it isusa street I'm not going to charge you for this one they had everything from A to Z in the USA come on ausa look it up they had everything from A to Z in the USA they had everything in the world out there cuz remember we started out here in the East and then it trickled went all the way to the west and then it stopped oh yeah there was a few went here and there but they it stopped on the on the west coast in theza Street on the mission the Holy Ghost fell on a bunch of trinitarians but he was pleased to dwell in them at the moment he was pleased for for bar and different ones to open up the word of God to the group of people that he had but the messenger of Malachi 4 was not on the scene yet cuz he was to turn the hearts of those people back to original Pentecost that we're talking about in ad30 everybody with me so the beginning and ending of the dispensation of the Gentiles started the same way it ended the same way all right it's ending up now with a Pentecostal blessing First Alpha Bride Comes in they they were bride but there was no messenger of the age then ad 56 Paul steps on the scene he's a messenger establishes um the Church of Ephesus brother BR said and that's our marker from 856 well brother Brown was born in 1909 1906 zuda Street Mission started they were trinitarians but God said I'm pleased to dwell in them I'm going to send the real true baptism of the Holy Ghost but that's not all I got to restore the gifts according to my I mean restore the word back according to Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the children those 1906 Babylon Pentecostal babies he was turning them back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers that had this working in their life and had this working in their church right everybody with me so you got the book ends he was both Alpha and Omega of course he was in between all the other letters but he specifically said Alpha and Omega he had a rainbow over his head which is covenant now if you notice the light now watch the light of Pentecost what did I just say there was a Pentecostal age over here right right there was a Pentecost age 1906 now if you notice the light of Pentecost where it started gradually smothered out H you've lost your first love these men ireneus polycarp all the rest of them sealed their testimony with their blood until it finally squeezed Christianity into the darkest of days Philadelphia and church age brother Brown said he had his hands out in the form of a cross I'm Alpha and Omega in other words I'll be Supreme in the first and I'll be Supreme in the last now what did he do in the first chapter of Revelations he revealed his Supreme deity to the first church in Ephesus is that right well now notice every one of these churches coming down through here he revealed himself in deity look only in his glorified form if you don't understand that I'm going to explain it to you he revealed his Supreme de the first church age had no problem with one God they knew who he was they knew who that he had all these compound names but he was that Jesus Christ that walk to the Earth they didn't have a problem with that until people like sthus and different ones got sitting around going well you know I saw him cry I saw him he had to go to the bathroom he can't be God uh maybe he's just a like person of God maybe he's kind of a little bit like oh he's his son so now let's split him now he said I'm going to send the Holy Ghost back so now let's give us another person over here do you understand you see how that see how easy that would be but now remember he revealed himself in his deity on his glorified form down through the other ages because they believed the father son Holy Ghost Doctrine but now remember if they didn't believe it we had to be restored too right the Omega bride had to come back to where your first seal and your first three Church ages correlate with each other because of what's the first seal the mystery of iniquity what that God's not three he's one same thing in the church age one God so it had to be restored back here so the first seal when it opened it wasn't that that rider was riding off and this is this and this is that no there was two the two forces right brother Bram said here stands the Lamb with his book in hand there goes a wy's riter in other words if you got two people on the scene one's got to be God the other one's got to be the devil there's only two Powers one's permitted and one's the big man all right so everybody had a little bit of Revelation but on this last one he becomes Z back to the original beginning again the first and the last the first age now the last age priest said I am the first and the last and then the Masterpiece we talked about the other day the seed is back to its original condition listen that's us there's no life in the shook anymore there's no life in the stock anymore the life is only in the seed right and the seed's the word of God and must have all the word in order to be seed now you can't have half a seed it won't grow right you can't cut a seed in half and plant it yeah you can plant it you won't get anything the word has become flesh exactly like he promised in Luke 17 Malachi 4 and all these others a true life that all true life that was in the stock tassel and husk Luther Wesley and Pentecost was true they was true Holy Ghost they were True Believers in their age ready for the resurrection ready for the Harvest This Is Us is now gathering in the seed the alpha has become Omega amen the first come last and the last is first the seed that went in has come through a process says and become the seed again that's me and you the seed that fell in the Garden of Eden and died there come back for that imperfect seed that died there comes to the perfect seed the second Adam which is Jesus Christ which was not born of a natural seed he born of a spiritual seed a creation of God the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the last message is the same I was in Alpha I'm in Omega there'll be a day that won't be called day or night but in the evening time that's where we're at it shall be light see Alpha and Omega has become the first and the last did everybody understand that because it proved its point right here when brother rown saw the vision of the church and the bride remember the bride comes into view beautiful of all Nations they're dressed right they go off the scene then here comes the American Church naked twisting everything going in every different direction if you know what I mean he was ashamed of it he turned turned away from it he said oh is this all I produced and the angel said no no no don't don't worry Here Comes Your group amen you know you and I were in that group spiritually we were in that group but the Bride come into view twice so it was one time then the church and then the bride comes into view again the seed fell in the ground at Nia and it had to come up that's why brother Brandon preaching the spoken words Original Seed I believe he really what his message was I mean yeah he did down through he would hit not hit and miss IND Doctrine but he he'd Proclaim something and then say well but boy when he come to spoke Original Seed he said look it's come back to grain now this is grain we're talking about here this ain't no stock this ain't no shook this is grain and then when God told him said pick up your pen and write man he poured it on yes sir and I'm sure people left him then listen that's the only reason she was in view reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time then she was reviewed the second time and she is perfectly the second time like she was the first time Revelations 2 vers1 to the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things which sayith he that holdeth the Seven Stars and his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor listen God knows everything and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil right and thou H has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and H has found them Liars amen wow and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from when thou art fallen in other words remember Pentecost remember when I fell on a group of people that were scared to death and those people came out and and by this time he wrote this they've all died except John every one of them had died except John remember from when thou are fallen and repent do the first words go back do the first words or else I'll come unto thee quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate yes Believers God hates cuz he said he did ever tell you God don't make a mistake okay so God don't make a mistake if he wrote this right here and said I hate him too then that's something he hates he hates the Deeds of the nicians which is people as the Catholic church has done has conquered the leoty and give them no voice no power nothing all right they may have been identified identical with those who held the doctrine of balum and I told you about a hirling prophet and all those different things we praise God we know that brother Ram come back and he he did as he Elijah did in at Mount Carmel excuse me he put everything back together he put everything He restored the the rocks on the altar He restored worship He restored everything as Elijah did there on the mountain so God hates that he hates ncismelanie and is not for you to know the times of the seasons which the father hath put in his own power this is Jesus talking is in red letter not me putting it in there that's red letter but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses to Jerusalem Judea Samaria and Lula Georgia can somebody say praise God he was thinking of me when he was saying that I hope he's thinking to you yes sir I'm going to send I'm going to send up there the Holy Ghost to that group of people and I'm going to burst some children and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received in my other sight listen that's why people hate the cloud in the end time they hate that thing amen cuz he left in the cloud he's coming back in the cloud and a cloud received him out of their sight while they looked steadfastly toward heaven in other words they were going where'd he go what happened I thought he was going to rest Jerusalem every kept they kept asking they had no Revelation are you going to restore Israel at this time are you going to fight our battles for us are you going to like take that big old spear you're talking about run it through them 10,000 Romans that are persecuting us and we're just going to have a an absolute Millennium that's what they were believing that's why a lot of people didn't believe listen he was seen a 500 people after his resurrection a glorified Jesus walked on the Earth 500 people saw him and only 120 made it to the upper room where the other 380 go well maybe not oh he really wasn't a prophet oh oh no that message I can't believe that you know I'm going go back over here where I was at M you men of Galilee other words there was two men stood in white apparel why are you gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven so shall come in light manner as you have seen him go into heaven and we know in 1963 he did not physically come back I want y'all to understand that when we say he came back 1963 he came back in word form in his bride in the fullness of the godhead bodily in The Headstone not his personal being everybody with me his personal being will not return and put his feet on this Earth till the Millennium so we got a little time remember we meet him in the air praise God for a prophet Luke 24:46 he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and rise from the dead the third day this is Jesus talking and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but car ye in the city of Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high what's you talking about what is the promise of the father it's a promise of the Holy Ghost to come back in a group of people and be the Holy Ghost dispensation down through the church ages everybody with me say Amen the Son of God dispensation listen Jesus is not on his throne right now remember everybody saw him standing on the right hand of the father standing making intercession but one day he's going to sit down but not until he makes his enemies his foot stol not until we get to the Millennium when he becomes in dispensation he'll become the son of David and he'll sit down on his own throne but the father's Throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why I totally disagree with the people that say well I'm not taking communion because Christ come in 1963 and we don't have to take it anymore well I got something for him Jesus told him said I'll not drink this with you till I come in my father's Kingdom well when did his father's Kingdom Come just a few days later on the day of Pentecost that's why the book of Acts is full of people going to church and taking communion listen if it's good enough for them good enough for me I'd be lary of any doctrine that takes stuff out of the Bible sorry I would CU Revelations over there in about 20s something over there said something about plagues and names took out and yeah let's just leave it like it is Jesus said do this till I come that's right all right and I believe he meant physical form okay everybody with me because he did not come in 1963 in physical form so he could take communion with us he came in spiritual form and the opening of the word to open the complete word of God The Headstone came back what to the church to the bride to the El lady he's at me and you now doing the work now his body when nail scars in it has not come back yet is sitting at the right hand of God he says sitting but he's standing he's sitting on the father's Throne now which now look but when he comes back he's going to sit on his own Throne the Throne of David look that he inherited that's when he comes in physical form but see he's here now in spiritual form working through your body and my body body all right everybody with me the breach it comes from the father's Throne where he has been seated now he is Seated on the father's throne in your heart where's the father's Throne at the moment it's in your heart where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised again he raised up and sat on the right hand of God look making intercession who is that that's Jesus Christ in intercessory form called the Holy Ghost that's why so important for you to have the Holy Ghost Acts 2 verse1 when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were with one mind and one Accord in one place praise God they might have drove Chevrolets and fors a few backslid Toyotas where Danny and backslid Nissan but they came for one thing God told him to go somewhere and wait to be endued with what power power that you had never had before receive the Holy Ghost today folks it'll be a power you've never had before Oh I it looks so bad it looks so weak you're not looking at the right Jesus he never ever fails it's like brother Ron said said I ain't never seen him lose one he enters into a battle never is there any odds of him losing right he wins every time so let's let him fight our battles enter in with him and let him fight for us and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting they appeared on them clothing tongues like a fire do y'all remember that tape there's a tape somewhere I know maybe probably sister C knows that where there's a tape where brother brandham when he's up he's getting ready to to end the service and you hear this he said that was the same thing he said it's the Holy Ghost ghost coming into the room oh praise God I I pray that if it don't ever happen here that's okay but I sure would love for it to happen and they were all filled well if you desire listen if that's the desire of your heart if you're if you're ashamed of it you'll never see it and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there was dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now what' they say they said how is this miracle that we're listening to every man and we're hearing him in our own language that's where the Pentecostals got him wrong tongues is the evidence no tongues is not the evidence listening is the evidence faith comes by hearing not by speaking in tongues they heard everyone that was the mystery that they heard them all in their language so Pentecost means 50 we know that keep going now this is Peter with the keys got the keys in his hand so whatever he unlocks down here is God's got to unlock up there now when they heard this they were pricked in the heart and said un Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Father the gift of the Holy Ghost for that promise is unto you and to your children all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words he did testify and exhort saying save yourself from this wicked or untoward generation they don't even know anything about Wicked according to us then they gladly received his word they were baptized and brother George Smith you know he knows about Jerusalem he knows everything he said now where they had this upper room he said it was about a 100 miles from the nearest water he said I'd like to ask Peter where he baptized 3,000 people and it wasn't a water hole nearby I think God may have just created one gave them a flood and said here baptize these 3,000 people we can't go 100 miles you baptize them right here y'all going to understand that when we get in the glor get to glory and we look at those people that Liv in the book of Acts there's going to be more miracles That Never Was Written that you're going to go wow that happened under the power of the first church and you know what they're going to look at us and say hey what happened in your age we barely made it but we watched you guys we watched the Holy Ghost fall on the original Believers and we became that we didn't copy it Satan's a copier no the same holy ghost that fell there we realize it fell on us right but but your age was wicked hey everybody's dealt their age we were number seven but God put every one of us in an age that we can make make it and overcome so you're in the age of the Overcomer in your age The Darkest Hour you'll ever see on the face of the earth is right now but it's the most glorious time to be here we're going home this is not this is not your house then they gladly received his word were baptized the same day and added 3,000 souls and look and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship y boy if we could do that in a message you know if you get two preachers in a room there's three opinions and they continue steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship that was an old thing that come from beekeepers they said if you if you ask 10 beekeepers uh one question you get 11 different answers and they contined steadfastly in Apostles Doctrine in fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayer they took communion I'm bring something out maybe later on make it a little bit solemn for right now but if it happened then it's going to happen now brother Ram said there was an anany and saf Fire Spirit in that age there going to be one in this age that's right amen you know I got a revelation today brother Bob after you walked out of the room for some silly reason I did do you know if they were on if they were like they they had all things common right everybody with me the reason anas and Safara got killed by God was that they withheld some of their money that they had pledged right what if they missed the church service that Peter said you got to give it all there's a day of visitation and if you miss it it's your fault right God's here every service what if ananas heard this great sermon by Peter that says Oh we must give all and and and and stopped his sermon right there and then the next week Ann and sa fire went out tried to make some more money that's a man and a woman if y'all don't know that that's some husband and wife and they went out to make some more money and so Peter has another sermon the next the next uh Sunday and he says now if you withhold you've done it against the Holy Ghost you've done it against me cuz remember he told him specifically he said you didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy Ghost and an I fell over dead and you know what they took him out and buried him his wife walks in they must not have communicated very well and she said the same thing so they were both in the same boat but just be careful if there's one there brother R said there's one coming here and that's lying to the Holy Ghost remember the Bible tells us that they'll come a day when the The Sinner won't be able to sit in the congregation of the righteous folks God's going to weed the weeds out we don't judge who the weeds are we preach the gospel he's a one he's the one that separates the tears from the wheat all right but remember what what what God say let them grow though let them grow so we can tell the difference cuz listen one's going to grow this way one's going to grow this way I'm sorry God is a segregationist I am sorry brother Brown said he was and God said he was I hate that thing will you do you go somewhere that you hate I hope you don't hate us I hope he loves us he loves everybody but you and I make the choice whether to be one or the other everybody all right Peter on before the day of Pentecost was given the keys to the kingdom we find out that he opened it to the Jews on the day of Pentecost so he opened the door he was a spokesperson as as the oneeyed black man I'm trying to think of his name um param daddy Seymour all right opened the door but he wasn't the spokes I mean he was a spokesman but he wasn't a prophet we had to have a res praise God that just hit me we had to have a restoration Prophet on the scene he didn't restore he just brought the gifts back but they still were trinitarian God hated that right when they preach that God had to go with brother R coming he hates false Doctrine right but he's so gracious and so merciful to take the part that they were supposed to play and he said I'm pleased to dwell in that group of people right listen daddy seyar will and is in that sixth Dimension he's waiting on me and youly right he not lost no way I believe that he was a born again Christian that's right but he was in that Pentecostal age that didn't have a messenger but we got a messenger in this age yes and the final voice to the final age under her messenger is sitting here today that's right so Peter was a spokesperson he opened to the Jews waiting on Paul as brother Brown said a little short stooped over hook nose high-tempered Jew that's pretty much a direct quote would you have picked him no you wouldn't have Hey listen they ran from him could you imagine the first time Paul steps out and says hey ho hey come back come back come back I'm not here to kill you but what did the Holy Ghost do those people that he persecuted had the Holy Ghost everybody with me and when he got the Holy Ghost it brought them together right it did not separate them we ought to put that in there mouth and chew on that for a little while the hly if you got the Holy Ghost and I got the Holy Ghost whether you drive a forward or chevolet right doesn't matter it brings us together under the word of God Amen so it brought them together under the word of God Paul he took what brought the logos of God he brought it to the people and the people that had listen he was preaching to people a lot of times that that had the Holy Ghost already they got it in ad30 he start preaching 056 they had established a couple of churches maybe between now and then between 830 and 56 but then there was a group of people that he come to that had never even heard of the Holy Ghost oh praise God then they got it so then they sent up for him they had the keys and he laid his hands on talking about Peter Acts 2 verse 46 and they continually daily with one Accord in the church we can't make it without each other we are sheep and he's a wolf and we have a great Shepherd amen that keeps a sheep that's right and they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart now that doesn't mean that Peter ate chicken and the rest of them ate chicken because Peter did but they had one singleness in heart what is the heart the Holy Ghost that's the inner that's the soul of you cuz remember we're going to get to a part here people where where where Paul now the Bible specifically tells us Barnabas full of the Holy Ghost powerful man in the Bible Paul Church age messenger obviously full of the Holy Ghost they get together and they do some work but all of a sudden they have a little difference of opinion right one goes one way one goes the other way you don't hear Barnabas no more and you hear Paul now was Barnabas lost or back SL no one drove a chevet and one drove a Ford but Barnabas didn't deny the word of God because he had a word of God inside of him what am I telling you we may have our differences but we need to be singleness inside of oursel in one heart I want to see this church full of Holy Ghost fill people not just people and then I want that Holy Ghost to mature into a statue of a perfect man to where we don't have to listen we don't have to call the preacher find him every time you got a toothache Lay Your Hands on the sick lay your hands on your children Hannah is not going listen to this but she's fixing to have some hands laid on her I'm tired of her being tired I'm tired of me being tired of her and I ain't tired of her because you know what I mean but I don't touch her much you may think it's a silly but how many times have you we won't even get to Paul we'll get to him next week how many times of you told Brother Dale that your back hurt or your shoulder hurting right and sometime during the day he can bring you up here and Shake you and throw all all over you right right he said God bless you brother good to see you you know what he's doing he's making a contact and he's praying in his heart for that shoulder without him going oh bless God he's going to be healed because I prayed for him God you feel that brother no he probably didn't feel a thing but you know what most of the time it went away sister Gail she's she's probably watching online now she same thing I was preaching one time this been 10 more years ago and I saw her kind of sitting cockey over in her seat over there she finally straightened up and she just raised her hand and you know silently I thought well okay what had happened was she had a back a she couldn't she couldn't hardly bend over she you know how you get when you get a back eight you either like this or you over like this and she said she said I just believe what that man said right I believe what brother W said didn't I mean we was from here to to where Sister Mary sitting now where her and Dick used to sit healed just like that that's what a mature church I'm talking about you I ain't talking about me I'm talking about you a mature church should be run if you want to say that God runs his business different than we do but he gives us his business that he runs right here and this is the Playbook this is the whole thing don't need another opinion this is it right here cuz remember the Pentecostal they always now Jamaica boy was over in Jamaica and they was you know W this place that Daddy was preaching out they weren't they weren't message Believers but brother Keith had um brother SCS and him had been friends so Daddy went and preached a wonderful week of messages on Oneness and uh oh they were trying to get them to speak in tongues they and then they shake them and then and Daddy's over there he's dealing with a couple of people he just dealing with them dealing with them silently dealing with them when the service was over and everything got quiet down they had a guy up there his name was Clark and he's big he was bigger than Michael and had a wingspan of several feet big old black guy and they called him the prophet Prophet Clark he stands up he says oh deep voice I mean man you're like he said I want to tell y'all something he said I've watched all week y'all trying to get people to get the Holy Ghost by beating them on the back of course they're like they're all like he's a prophet we consider him maybe not anymore he turned around he said Daddy was sitting over there he said but that man right there has been telling us the truth all week never had to lay his hands on anybody never had to slap anybody or beat him on the back in other words he said that man's been telling he took that finger and it looked like it went all the way to Daddy's nose he was he was 20t away but he was like that man told us the truth all week and I watched him tonight and that's the right way to do it and boy they a get no clapping either it was just like dead silence cuz I mean they've been Ian they really because we sit in the back me and brother Harris was stood we actually we stood in the window looking in they was so packed full of people and they would try to get them to speak in tongues and they go and you could hear them well all they was doing was that was it and I don't say they wasn't any God in there but that's not a way to get God into somebody right and that's what brother Ram tried to explain and they got mad at him because see most of the people in that church based their whole Christian experience on that thing right there and beat him on the back take him in the room no you just deal with them Jesus never dealt with anybody that way he dealt with them quietly unless he was dealing with the devil but he still told the devil he said go just go but look right here this is the people of that age they continued daily with one according to Temple breaking bread from house to house they did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily as should be saved we know what Peter did Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give thee in the name of Jesus rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones receive strength acts 7:57 here's where all comes into view where they they Steven got him so upset they stopped their ears and ran after him and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul we've all been Saul but he had a name change and they stoned Steven calling upon God saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin what a Christian listen it wasn't a sorry to be graphic it wasn't a you're dead they stoned him with stones that means they kept hitting him in the head and in the back and in the arm until he died they bludgeoned him to death and it was a slow agonizing death but he looked up and said lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep he die the first martyr the first martyr he fell asleep he die that's right can't kill me can't kill you so the age of Pentecost started with a messenger of the Holy Ghost let's stand our feet come on musicians and then we know that continued on the day of Pentecost and we know what happened I remember we'll give this right here real quick Peter was the spokesperson and had the keys to open the door of the Gentiles until Paul come on the sink because then you got Peter Peter says hey Paul says things really hard to be understood in other words Peter's Revelation was good but Paul's was different as far as Paul was a prophet to write 80% of the New Testament but you see that right there on the day of Pentecost there was a Pentecostal Revival started before the book of Ephesus or before the church age of Ephesus started and Paul comes at the end of the Pentecostal age you see that everybody see that say Amen all right then you come over here to brother brandom now there's another one we're going to look at later on see where says holy ghost the Holy Ghost came from Wesley before brother Ram came on the scene there was a holy ghost Revival no Messenger to the age the Holy Ghost came himself through a oneeyed black man param and different ones and then brother Bram comes on the scene and starts his message we thank God we're a part of it thank God look he comes and condemns the world he rebukes the previous age who brother R rebuke he rebuked the Pentecostals but he didn't continually do that he said said all right I got a message to bring I got a message to bring and he brought it to who me and you amen you love the Lord thank you for for His blessings he he just blesses us and gives us stuff and and sometimes we don't realize that God is really on the scene and we don't we don't realize it let's don't miss our day of visitation let's don't miss that God don't let me miss that day cuz remember I'm telling you you can miss your day of visitation by not being at the right place at the right time right you love the Lord let's sing a song If you need have a need pray for Brother John here will we coming back listening to him on listen the ground is not what is Holy it's the people standing on the ground it's what's [Music] [Applause] [Music] holy all [Music] [Applause] around
