i amen amen yesterday we opened well i've never you know had a problem with uh recognizing people a lot of times anyhow anyhow sister mcnally doris mcgowan she was sitting behind us and they turned

and i thought i'll live if uh looks and kelly god be dead you know her sister's saying yes to everyone uh sister mary beth was up behind the pulpit you could see from her nose up i was able to get out behind but she didn't hear me you know but anyhow probably on the internet y'all i want to see i want to see the eyes of my heart is oh that's right amen good word to see you man good to be in the house of the lord good to see everybody out loud brother bob mom and dad with us all right the lord would bless and guide each one as well the dick said we had a good time at the fellowship meeting yesterday and the lord willing the one in marx will be at brother pageants so remember that you know we've had many sick among us and many have gotten back in and and gotten over kind of the bugs yeah things you know we appreciate that appreciate the lord being with each one uh remember brother richard marlow was sick this morning and brother al and brother gary so we know those are are not feeling good so just pray that the lord would be with each one remember brother howell he's sick the lowest i've seen him in 19 years he's fallen out remember brother brother just lord blessing brother and sister thomas i mean um most of you remember that brother bill york the kind of tall guy that came a time or two back under a few months ago uh he passed away this past week so just remember the family and everybody you know the big tall blond-headed guy that came with brother ray and him really you know also remember that revelations one revelation eight i believe that's all the announcements that's to be made just pray that the lord would bless each and every one of us father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us yes thank you for the day that we have the time that we can lord in a hustle and bustle of life and all kind of things but to be able to just gather together and sit down lord and wait upon you and in doing that then we know that surely you will come and speak to our hearts because that's our desire it's for you to have your way with each and every one of us forgive our sins lead us by thy grace and love remember the sickling lord among us and you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we just committed all into your hands now as we read your word we ask that you would come and speak to our hearts because that's our desire we love you and we thank you hunter committing it all now into thy hands most of all forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and just have your way now in jesus name amen revelations 1. we've been reading this scripture and one of these days we'll get over far enough you'll see why i've been reading revelations 1. says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his angel and to his servant john and by record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand so one of these days we'll get over there i think it's about 21 or 22 he comes back to that and says the time is at hand right so we appreciate that okay revelations eight one and when he had opened the seventh seal there were silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we have been quite a while on this and just getting everything down and you will understand maybe a little later on when we we we try to get on over pisces chapter 10 because we really got up to the reading eight one but we're over basically in chapter 10 in our studies in the book of revelations and you know after this part that we get through with this dealing with the uh the 11 12 13 14 i don't know how much we'll put into each one uh as understanding but i want you to think about it and i wish you would go back and read the book of daniel and and read that and then and think of that in relation to what uh we will try to be covering because to me the book of daniel is uh it's not many different visions now i know he had him covered over a period of time like john was writing two years on patmos you know it only took him two days to write the whole book you know if he was just sitting down writing but he was two years and getting it and writing it down and see the book of daniel the end of me i've always loved it because it's a continuation of opening up of things to show you after the prophet has brought us the understanding showing us the end times showing us the journey of life and things in the book of daniel and it's a wonderful story but it just to me it's like you see this and then you see more and then you see more and then you see more and it's all one vision then one uh thing that's or transpiring one uh whatever you want to call it uh scenes or whatever and to me that's the way i see the book of revelation because especially as we'll get on over now a little bit later and you'll see that like showing you for instance what i'm talking about in chap in the sixth chapter where the opening of the seals especially say the sixth seal and it just talks about an earthquake it talks about things that are transpiring and and we know that the prophet brought us those understandings of it to see those signs but then when you read the 11th chapter or something like that that's actually just a repeat of the sixth seal because what it is it's just telling you there about this hundred and forty four thousand that's where the prophet got the understanding to preach on the sixth seal you know and then preaching on the sixth seal he would carry it and bring in all about the 144 000 the ceiling and the foreheads and the different things and see you'll find out then basically from chapter 10 on over to uh the white throne about the 17th chapter that is actually a three and a half year period right now you know it it will trans it will tell about how these begins and ends but it's dealing with this tribulation period is what it will be dealing with and that's what i said that's where the prophet then when he preached the sixth seal see he knew already the story behind the two witnesses and so he brings that out and he tells you about this and he brings that out and and things and if we can get there this afternoon i want to make one um message kind of showing you uh what i think that he saw and why he spoke the way he did and and covering the things that he saw and then see if we can see ourselves amen now because we're going to start moving up some in our we've just worked basically been grinding to get the foundation all right and that's just my way of doing it but now we want to pick up a little and we'll be repeating a lot of what we've said but i want us to pick it up into what is what does it mean to you and i yeah right you know i mean we can study the book of revelation it's like i told you uh anybody today uh they say oral roberts university has a complete set of brother brown's message well you know what they know what brother brown said you know you could call them up and if they see anybody studied that right you know you could call them up and say well what did brother brown say on the first seal well that's that was the bible's writer and they would tell you the things that he said all about it and give you verbatim the statements of what it is right and you can say well what did he say about this and they could tell you that why because they have it right but because that we have it doesn't mean we have the revelation that's what i've been trying to drive home and i want to drive that harder and harder because people are saying we have the message yes well anybody that wants to go on the internet that's right that's right right can search the message right man it's not just because we've got it in our hands everybody's got it once it was made public domain see then anybody can download a sermon anybody can do a search thing because you can go on their internet systems and and and it's not just that you can search to see what brother branham said anybody in the world today can search to see what the prophet had to say there'd never been a day like this even in the days of the lord jesus there was no way that the world could have seen everything it was only just a a small group of people right around one said something like one-tenth to one percent or so maybe like that so small a number of people that actually knew that jesus christ was on the earth but you realize that whether they want to agree with it or whether they're looking up to argue about it or trying to to whatever that anybody in the world today that has a computer can right get the message and tell you exactly what brother brown has taught and if they don't even have a computer they can get the mp3s the cds the cassettes and you know any kind of thing to to do and all they got to do is just write them and people send it to them so it's not the distribution oh we're wonderful people because we have the message that's true amen that's true but we can't rest in the basis of just saying we have the message the world don't have this message now that's where your people are wrong today the world has this message you don't believe me go back and turn the computer on anybody in the world that has a computer has the ability to tell you what run around saying right man that can be a good thing or it can be a bad thing because there won't be no argument when you if you're called into judgment there won't be no excuse of saying y'all don't know what we're talking about if y'all just knew this message they said what do you want to know about it yeah you know what you want to know what right around taught on one god throws you all the quotes you want to know what he told a marriage in divorce there's the book yep it's a wonderful day amen but yet they can take the message down twist it earn it do whatever that's right and make it say what they want to do and they'll ask you to say well did he say this it kind of reminds me i remember a story seeing it that when they were asking martin luther you know he said will you recant for what is written you know he said what i've written i won't right no yeah go see there was a lot of other people done added a lot of things to what he said but he said well what i've written that's right i am no way can recant from that what did you say is all right to burn all the catholic churches he said no i didn't say that that's right well we got a book here that says you sitting there i didn't say anything see they couldn't argue the point that's like i told you years ago was up in indiana and i remember it this is probably about 1970 might have been a 68 and brother bill paul said that the world council of churches ordered a church age book when anybody could get a true i mean all you had to do was just go to somebody said believer and they gave you a church they were just all over the place but you see they ordered one which means they can use it as evidence because you could claim well we didn't write that and so here is your publication you see church we're living in a wonderful day but we're sitting here facing the things that can destroy us right out of the message itself by being out on the internets and the things like that but what a wonderful day all right thank god but it's the same time i can search to find out what brother brown said anybody it's not just because we've got the message it's whether or not it's been revealed see then with that in mind i've tried to make that point over to us see we used to say we we have the message people don't know what we're talking about right now having the message in it being revealed is too different right all right it's not something that you don't know about right it's whether or not it's been revealed right amen there's the main thing right brother said we need a revelation more than anything now we've been as i said in this talking on the seventh seal found the prophet said a lot of things about the seventh city and we say well it's just silas in heaven for space a half hour but we found he said a lot of times he's told us what it was he said it was the end of all things he said it was those seven thunders of revelations 10. which is a revelation containing the seven seals he's told us that this messenger of malachi 4 will do two things one turn the hearts of the children back and other reveal the revelations of the seven thunders which is a revelation containing the seals he's told us it's the coming of the lord now those things we went through right you know to look at it but he's told us that you cannot add to the word you cannot take away that's right then you say well well then my idea the seventh seal or someone what does it make you different what your idea is my idea whose idea what did the prophet say even oral roberts university tell you what he said they wouldn't say this is our idea about it you ask us what he said we give you we'll give you the but you see in the message we're revelated people we're always looking for some form of of a great understanding that nobody else don't have you know and in doing that see then we wind up come find out most time we wound up not having it or sailed but still listen after something that the prophet said and the bible says that they're silenced in heaven we've had over the years emphasis placed upon by a lot of preachers and things that and using quotes from judge brown that would say that see there are the seven seals not even written well it says there's solace in heaven there's not a blank in revelations 8 1. he says there's silence in heaven right amen all right then we went through where the prophet would say this is my revelation of it program 245 of the seventh seal he said this is my revelation of it well that is like i told you then we we we we say well out seal one two three four five six you know then it comes at seven he said well this is my revelation he told us what his revelation was on seal number one i have to be dependent upon him to to be able to understand what seal number one is don't you but he said this is my revelation right when he come to the seventh seal it wasn't his revelation of a revelation of a revelation and had no revelation all right i hope that come out right i'm trying to put enough points into it when it says a silence in heaven that's written in the bible amen so that means the seven seals in the bible amen right there was a problem with the brother brown coming along then and we gave the quote where he said he said this seven seals even spoke up from genesis all these seals that spoke of coming down from genesis well it's not an addition to the book that's right you remember they said to it run around with your abilities and you could write a 23rd chapter of revelation he said they're trying to trap me he said no he said you can't add two well those seven thunders brother adam won't that be something that will be given to someone he said watch what you're saying right right see because you're saying that someone is going to receive something that is not written that's your implication and then that way you can make it anything you want it to be i can say my big toe is a seventh seal what you can say is yours is well that's being silly no it's just i have no scripture for my big toe being god but we do have a message that is the message is perfect amen sure the messenger had flaws in his human abilities in the speech and that but the message is perfect that's right but it's just written in all this in the same basis to me that's why it's so wonderful to read and study is because it's just like the bible was written that's right then we have the people in the message say you know and it's fine line these up and get them lined up well that's good but if you don't know how to get this one lined up with that one all right man i mean you guys all you want to about the two sides on the gun thank you yeah and if you lay that gun down in the vice and clamp it down and buckle it down and right get down there and look down through there it's going to show the same thing every time right but if you hold it up in your hand it's going to float around right and you ain't going to be hitting at a harsh breath at 100 yards you're going to be lucky with iron sights in a 2 inch group at 100 yards or something you know but you see that's the way we try to make it something why worry about making it something amen that's right if we're going to depend upon one two three four five six of the seals for you know the prophet to reveal it then we're going to depend upon marriage and divorce and we're going to depend upon this the serpent seek the one god the all of the things then why can't we depend upon what he says about it but yet they're arguing whether the seals broke or not the bible says it didn't matter right yes but we just don't know what we we know what them other signals are that's right now how did you know what they are right how did you come to the ability right of understanding seal number one because of the quota i'd love to give to you brother reynolds said they'd be a prophetic gift yeah we've been over at and overnight on questions and after it on the seal he said the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything right what's going to happen to it because at the end of that church age has become a prophetic gift to reveal this time so we're totally dependent upon him for everything well we better be totally dependent upon the seventh trim to the seventh seal to tell us what it is right that's right then when he says this is my revelation of it all right amen and then he'll say it's no seventh thunders of revelations 10. then he'll say it's the end of all things then he'll says the coming of the lord the thing that even jesus didn't know when he would return now we can go through the message and understand and see what is being said to us to help us to understand what does it mean to you to find out what it meant to him we must do that and we'll deal more that this evening with what it meant to him but if we don't find out what it means to us amen yes sorry no no different than oral roberts university with the tapes and books live in front of me that's right you certainly don't get to message reading grier's almanac faith truly must come by hearing amen and hearing by the word of god i kept emphasizing something to you the other day that i want you to get this morning he says there's silence in heaven perspective i know that what the prophet has said and can quote with you about it so the reason i say that is just for not to be smart ethically but to be truthful i know that brett around covers when it comes to seal number one he kind of drops back to earth and brings things but remember seal never want number one never broke on earth it broke into heaven amen was given to john brother branham said right and then was handed down he said to the seventh angel to proclaim all right so you're not on an earthly journey just because that you can see that's right that's why then it turned out to be as we've been over to chapter 10 chapter 10 you find this mighty angel standing on earth amen which is christ right right around said that seventh angel has to be on earth at the time of this coming talking of revelations 10 1 and through there now you're dropping back to earth because dropping back to earth means we're dropping back to the point of where that can be revealed to us amen that's right john went up over in revelations 4c 5 6 7 8 9 10. it's things that are transpiring in heaven we want to get to earth on a lot of it when i said what it did a moment ago that chapters when you get into the sixth seal it just says there's an earthquake and this happens and that happens this happened when we run around covered what happened he said this is the tribulation period and he said this is where the 144 000 is called out well it doesn't lift 140 one thousand in chat and the sixth seal is riding out he's giving you his revelation amen but he's got scripture for it right it's not just his thoughts he's telling us the scriptures the seal breaks in heaven chapter 5 is in heaven chapter 4 is in heaven amen the breaking of chap in chapter 6 of the first seal is in heaven preach your bible see then it's revealed and brought down to us by way of the seventh angel amen right to tell us about these things amen how many years have we preached to where the prophet said in chapter four of the book of revelation that the bride goes up amen and not seen until chapter 19. you see we're seeing by revelation what transpires in heaven now remember we were trying to bring out about the the prophet said that was silenced in heaven he goes right over to revelation 10 and he brings out it's those seven thunders then you back up to a message called is this the time just prior to the seal he said those seven thunders don't sound in heaven amen people said john was translated up and heard the thunders right fine sure but brother ryan said daniel heard the thunders that's right but daniel wasn't translated into heaven he was on earth writing about divisions that was coming to it see those seven thunder sound on earth amen why is there silence in heaven and where would that silence be related to in the scriptures you remember how i was bringing out and i hope you've listened at least you snore or not or whatever you know you have just to hire enough to understand i keep repeating things because it's very valuable to me the sixth seal has no mention of 144 000. there's no mention of two prophets in the writing of the sixth seal it's an earthquake it's things that happen transpired upon the earth right but the prophet goes over into the 11th chapter 12th and on through and picking up that two witnesses and 144 thousand right so that he's tied with the scriptures so when he comes to revelation 8 1 he says they silence in heaven because i'm going to tell you my revelation jumps right over to revelation 10. come on read the book 245 of the seal book i'm sitting or looking at if you want me to read it he goes immediately to chapter 10. all right what because it says the silence in chapter eight in chapter 10 it says seal up the things that the seven thunders said and write them not so then the bible is sealed with the seven thunders no no no brother daley seven seals the boy you you really oral roberts can say that right i hope they don't mind me using those terms you know because anybody with a book can read that i can ask you anything and you can go in there and sit down on the computer just type in thunder that'll come to you eventually and you can read it that's right right but listen he goes right straight to the thing that there's related to silence what if something is sealed up it's silent the book of daniel it comes to the end and daniel says he's told by the angel to seal up the things and write it now will not be made known until the end time when the prophet would come to bring us the message amen then we can understand the book of daniel in the book of revelation you see why the prophet would immediately go to that what's that this afternoon now when we tied together the lord willing when we come down to the tent vision the throne in the hand the third pull the things and and watch that again be repeating that's what i'm saying so it'd be good to write it down then when the prophet comes over to revelation 8 1. and it says silence in heaven he immediately goes to chapter 10 because he knows by chapter 10 the seals have already been broken by the lamb amen come on read your bible eight one comes before ten okay i'm not good in math if i get above that i'll take my shoes off but i can't at least get the pin but listen why would he immediately go to something that is sealed up right that's right brother adam what is revelation 8 1. you said revelation 10 yeah it's the thing that's sealed up those seven thunders the book is sealed with the seven thunders remember he said no no no no no you don't understand that we got a quote here we're good just keep quoting you'll find a good one where the prophet said the seals are sealed with their seven thunders sure he said until those to understand we don't know what these seals are he even said that if the seventh seal wasn't broke and all week long he had said this is thus saith the lord right come on and he said it throughout the week of the seals and all you know this is not saith the lord he gets over to the questions and answers he says if god don't come and break that seventh seal we're only presuming amen right what about having that said the lord and you're only presenting me yeah come on you explain that now if you if you want questions you know people got questions what is this and what is that i got a lot of good ones i don't mean yours ain't a good one i just mean i got a lot of good ones but why would you immediately go from revelation 8 1 over to revelations 10. he said there's silence in heaven for the place a half hour to seal up those things which is seventh underground and write it not right but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the prophet said not in his years of preparation as he was restoring the faith of the fathers but he said when he begins to sound his message amen the brother around his message began with the opening of the seals right he preached about three years the other was a restoration back to the faith of the fathers that was written in the book seals is not an addition to the book or he would be the false prophet amen to try to tell us his revelation of something is not even written at all he just says they silence in heaven brother adam if they silence in heaven i can understand and go with you and believe you jump over to revelation 10 to find and show me something there that is sealed up that nobody don't know anything about and that would make definitely a silence huh a lot of blabbering about what it is i hope i get down to the description in a minute but you know but that brought around i want to know one thing when you got to this part of explaining it and you said all in heaven stood in all you remember that he said they didn't move because he did said he'd give away the secret i'm brought around them where are you at certainly not on earth because there's too much blabbering going on right i think you see this i think is that blah blah blah blah blah you know so he's certainly not on earth who is in heaven now i ask you a simple question where is there silence in heaven where's your scriptures brother branham that you're going to you're a scriptural prophet where are you going to tie it to he said all them cherubims and all them angels i'm paraphrasing but i'm quoting him come on almost 24 hours standing in awe now where's he at he's in revelations four and five right come on you understand i hope you're catching on that brother around had scripture for things we must have scripture by way of him see not our own but our own's gonna twist it like crazy so if i'm gonna depend on him to help my tell me his revelation i'm certainly gonna depend upon him tell me the scripts right all right i may be dumb but i ain't stupid all right but you go to chapter four and five like i said i got a lot of questions what is the bride does she go up in revelation 4 1 is that the words of the prophet well i want to ask you a simple little question how can there be 24 elders in chapter 4 and time a simple question right around who are those 24 elders he said to 12 apostles and the 12 patriarchs that's right right now i can understand because of rapture in chapter 4. bringing it in john type in the rapture to be able to go up to heaven to see things but how can those 12 patriarchs be there i got questions too right but also like something else that was said one time about me you know we were speaking one time on marriage and divorce and a certain man he was up speaking and i got up behind him and i asked a few questions and he raised his hand and the end of it and he said uh i hate it when a man asks a question when he's the only one in the building's got the answer i said i wouldn't ask the question if i didn't have the answer you want to sit down and talk we talk i don't ask the question that i don't know the answer you say well i ask questions because i don't know them you don't study long enough if you study a long time you'll find out there's an answer all right just like brother branham now there's silence in heaven for a space of half hour where have you got a scripture for that he said well okay he says all those elders and all those angels and all those chirpings and things are standing in awe now where's he at he's in chapter five he has a scripture he knows where he's at but still brother branham i want to know one thing because in chapter 5 all at once it becomes a from a situation of standing in awe it comes to a time of a highly glorious elated wonderful shouting glory hallelujah time in chapter five right even john said everybody in the world heard me hollering that's right amen right but you better read your bible john wooden hollering until the lamb took the book all right are we in the scripture do we need to read chapter five for you to know what i'm talking about is in there john sees actually all lost without a lamb to come forth amen is that chapter five he sees all law without a lamb pull it up brothers we might as well get all this out of the way while we had it brother joe pull up chapter five i know you can do that in hurry while i talk a little bit see there's a silence in heaven for a special half hour then there's a rejoicing in heaven i don't really know how long that lies do you ain't going to worry about it right but look i saw on the right hand of him and said on the throne book written within on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book in the loose to seal thereof proclamation goes out is there anybody that steps up and tells you now wait a minute you don't read them down here but just stay with me where i'm at okay brendan said we'll pull it up just read it when you see a book and a proclamation and he says no man in heaven nor on our earth neither under the earth was able to open the book needed to look their own right okay jordy much going on and i went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither through the god now you know what the prophet said happened there was he said and this is a man that's had the baptism of the holy ghost for 60 years he's not wondering about whether or not he's saved right right he ought to know by now pretty well that he is saved because he wouldn't be taken up to where he was if he hadn't been saved and you know he didn't use somebody else he used john but when john comes to this point of seeing things he knows there's something about the plan of redemption that is not complete yet right he has already written his gospel come on he wrote john right we you're with me same one that wrote john the same one went to pat my scene 1995-96 right right he's already wrote about the savior he's already even said and wrote that john the baptist said behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world amen so he knew he was a savior he knew he was god he explains him in john 1 1. in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he's writing this somewhere around 80 50 according to the records it wasn't actually pinned as they went along somewhere close to 80 50 the four gospels were written you remember luke and mark was not even one of the originals and john has already written about these things he's already seen maybe millions saved under his ministry right or either two wouldn't make a difference right two or two million don't matter to god just get the point that's what you say you say something to people how did he know they were familiar then you're buying dumb gone and you ain't heard nothing else i'm saying you're gonna erase it all out your computer went blank your brain hold it back up and i say those things that make you think i'm talking brother ron spencer last night about something i said he said something about your smart man that's no ain't smart i said a smart man is not one you think knows everything i said a smart man is not the one who knows everything cody's got his brain full of junk a smart man is a man that knows where to go get what he needs you've heard me explain that a lot of times you know what he said einstein said he said einstein said why to try why try to remember what you can write to him i didn't know he said that i said well he's a pretty smart guy me and him get along a little bit don't put me in that gotta go with it but what but listen and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book needed to look down so there wasn't nobody running around screaming and hollering it's in a quiet mode nobody's saying i know who can do it you know that brother random said the sages were there the prophets and things was there right now you take over 24 elders and get down in there with it and you'll find out there's a lot of things in there they were there but he said they wouldn't worthy so that get pretty quiet if i said around here is anybody worthy to take the book that's right i wouldn't raise my hand and you wouldn't do yours either because you know you'd be wrong that's right so things was pretty quiet in heaven but then he wept much and watched one of the ever said to me we not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book in the loose the seven seals thereof okay a proclamation is made of one that can do it and watch the next verse and i'll be held in lord in the midst of the throne into the four beasts and in the midst of the elders instead of lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spiritual gods set forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne there's your deadly huss silence right there even though the lamb has the book in his hand he hasn't said a word i asked a person a question the other day which was not even a christian they just come across not derogatory to anybody and i just asked a simple question i said why would there's silence in heaven first place a half hour there's no answer we'd be able to reply i said what would cause you now first we've got to get to standing all then we get to rejoicing okay everybody understand how we're going to divide the book of revelation this is off the message i need during page two so we'll get to see but what can you think about what can you think about that would make you stand in oh no the about it you think with me you know write it down if you want to whatever what would cause you to stand in total all in reverence for 30 minutes in heaven which that could mean i'm telling what on earth because that's what everybody's trying to figure it out they got it down to 21 years and they got it down to this and they got it down to that oh my lord it says silence in heaven don't say unto about earth what's silence in heaven when heaven has no time right ain't no days and times and seasons in heaven nobody tried to figure out 30 minutes on earth well it's about 21 years so it ought to be well it's over with by now about the 21 you had figured out yeah but listen what could happen robbie that would cause you to stand in awe and afraid to move a muscle afraid to battle an eye what could happen well now what it is brother david i i just walk up to him and i hand him a million dollars he's smart enough to know that ain't right that's right because you know what to do if i started handing out million dollar bills this day there'd be a stampede up this way and they'd be screaming and hollering are you getting the point sure wouldn't be silence would it there won't be no afternoon service yeah because there wouldn't be nobody here everybody be gone to pay the bills to buy the car to buy the home to do the what surely wouldn't be silence the woman calls you what would cause you because remember in chapter five you are supposed to be there that's right maybe not in a corporal body because i don't personally believe revelations 5 is physical corporal believe it's john in heaven seeing the future that can become physical and corporal what would cause you to stand standing on remember those in heaven must be looking down the earth i made a little point a moment ago i didn't know where you followed it or not but the seven thunder sound on earth that's right what would be that would cause you to standing on okay brother dale you tell us what you think it is the thing that would cause me to stand in perfectly all in a condition would not be no materialistic nothing or any form you realize that a revelation is eternal you ever noticed that god revealed something to you especially say you preachers you know to think about it god revealed something to you it takes you five years to preach what he showed you in a split second right right what about something sister gail when you were standing in the kitchen there and he was mopping or whatever he was doing and you know what happened something spoke to he didn't you said that ain't nothing but the truth but you're just one god you know that time stood still sure amen now that was only a blink between we try to figure out all those things you know twinkling of an eye or this twitch or what whatever how long that is or what it is it's a wink or the but i've got something in my eye revelation is eternal amen amen there's no beginning has no ending when you saw this message was true you believe that right around with the prophet god sent a prophet a split second was what it was right right i heard people tell about you know that god told him to do this and i heard a man one time saying and he said god told him go fish over here and he said no road i'm gonna get you over here because there's water over here ain't nothing over there he's god just kept god kept telling him he said go over here and fish now you don't argue with god if you think you do you're arguing with the wrong one you got the guy with the horns talking to you god don't argue with nobody run around and say come down there in that room and meet me and tell me this and he said the rest of the day i spent it checking out to see whether it was true or not am i quoting from the syllabus you realize when something is revealed to you you're in heavenly places in christ jesus you agree how long earthly time only a split second now i know god deals with the rest of the day we're doing it but get what i'm saying he deals with you for months he does with me and i'm preaching on something that he spoke to me one split second right am i talking about that i'm talking about how long it was when he revealed it to you you saw one god you saw water baptism it was just that was it are you catching on what would cause you to stand in all i think i can say this about everybody here amen at least i'll say it for myself and i'm going to say it in a way that's a question if god would drop down right now and reveal to me in a split second that i'm just as righteous as he is by being in jesus christ you can have all your money you can have all your shoes out and hooplas you can have all the things i burned a million dollar check right but even by telling you okay we're going to give you a million dollars this morning when everybody here take a check million dollars i said you need to come back to see me it might be something else how many would come back i said your only condition is you got to burn that million dollar check you'd think about it i just talked i'm trying to get a point cry john saw the one that could take the book was he screaming and hollering no he waited till he got through taking the book then he started hollering that's secondary right i thought we believed the seals and the things was his prophet's message it was the plan of redemption that's right and even though they were back there and as they were bringing out while ago that the disciples they preached those great wonderful things but yet they never brought this into manifestation or an opening of the scenes and times it was left for the end time to be here with the bride of jesus christ and a prophet of god the plan of redemption now remember those that are in heaven whether you want to make it literal what you want to do with it i ain't going to argue with nobody i'm done i've already flushed around horror of all these years and they've done no good i'm going on down the road i preach what i believe you want to know what i believe go back and get the tapes when i bleed just don't accuse me of saying things that i don't say the tapes are there i'm going down the road one time this message has brought us the plan of redemption and you don't understand what you're doing if if you don't believe that seventh seal is open then you're not even into the silence right you're not even capable of understanding the plan of redemption amen that's right now how many of you been around here for quite a while heard me about 82 and 83 79 we don't have the tapes but we have the 82 and 83 where i preach what i believe those seals were never chose to go back and try to preach them over again did during 2005 just as a review for people here but i don't believe in arguing about anything i believe in preaching it and then going on down the road look to god to whether it's true or not but how many of you remember all down through there brother gary was here he could tell you the tape it was on and the day i preached it that these seals revealed the plan of redemption and that the disciples understood the plan of redemption for soul and spirit right but he didn't bring a dot bring it to an adoptional form to where that it would be to with the redemption of our body to understand the redemption of the body it would take this end time message to bring forth and review the whole entire plan of redemption but then the prophet's message would start and he would bring us the message to take to the change of these bodies the seventh seal then doesn't reveal anything about redemption the six seals to redemption what your prophet says six seal book of redemption how many measures of barley did he give ruth amen how many seals did jesus preach amen in matthew 24 he didn't have to preach the seventh because he was the seventh come on you want to argue the point he was seven he didn't have to preach it right he was just standing there amen so i told you over and over when i read the seal book the first time when i got over to the seventh seal and all i could see that brother around were talking about himself and that throwed me for a look and i said lord i don't understand what the man is doing all he did talking about himself he supposed to be telling me about you yeah come on so i better back up because i don't understand i backed up and went to the church age book stayed in it for years studying and then finally came forth and preached it and could see you know what he was doing he was talking about himself i was right all along i just didn't have it lined up in revelation but he was telling us what happened in his own life right right amen now what about in my life in your life amen amen prophet said it in the first paragraph for the seventh seal he said have we heard the voice of god speaking to our hearts through the opening of these seals he said have we heard the voice of god see church the thunder's the voice of god yet all we want is some kind of a thunder or some kind of a great revelation that nobody else don't have and try to if you think that's what brother dale's done i'm sorry for you amen i only try to preach what god reveals to me but you see the thunder is the voice of god that's what jesus said when he said it is this thunder now i've got these all written down your brain if you want them you can read my notes you know the story a voice from heaven spoke and said i'm glorified thy name and will glorified again they that stood by john 12 said heard it under it he heard a voice elijah one day was pulled back in a cave and he heard lightning wind he hurt thunder but he wouldn't get up walk out of the cave until he heard the still small voice am i right is that scripture the still small voice the prophet said that's what we need to hear he said that's god speaking in authority to you and i right a still small voice what does it matter whose voice is being used at the time are we listening to the voice are we listening to the still small voice that speaks with inside of us but remember voices are speaking outside of you can always be questioned lord spoke to me brother now told me is it contrary to the word that's right if it is then it wasn't god amen i don't care how much loud it got it thundered at mount sinai it scared the people to death but moses heard the voice of god they may have heard of lies going off out there in tucson have we heard his voice yes speaking to us by the revealing of the word are we just still listening for thunders and loud things and so and so elijah heard a still small voice right brother random heard a still small voice and then tried to tell us what that boy said to him thank god for that right but have you heard his voice speaking sister one time here years ago had a dream and she said brother dale said there was a voice in my dreams that it was speaking about the sick seal and bringing it down in the dream and telling what it was she said then i realized it was your voice well you see does that make anything out of you no if it did the donkey got just as much and the rooster too right are you in the bible you know a donkey spoke to a prophet one day it don't matter about what's speaking that's what's revealed that's why i asked the man i said what would cause you to stand in law for god to reveal the plan of redemption to me because you see the prophet didn't say he said they silence in heaven he didn't say they were silenced on earth if you go ahead and read the rest of what i was there in chapter five you'll find out in a few minutes they started rejoicing that all of those people are screaming and hollering and they're having a glory hallelujah time what after the lamb took the book right not before right after the lamb took the book heaven went to rejoice that's john said everything on earth hurt him yeah so it must have been transmitted down right so it must be right that the prophet said it was given to john and john handed it down right amen come on you say no i said i ain't your which one you want and the angel give it to john and john give it to an angel how many angels you want what do you want to deal with it just get the point if john hadn't wrote it down it couldn't have been transmitted to earth right but then once it comes to earth and just for a split second god revealed something to you you're standing in heavenly places amen think on these things what do these seals and things mean to you what about the rejoicing see i've been in a revival ever since i came in this message i hear everybody else talk about revival no you just don't know what you're talking about you ought to say as far as i'm concerned or revival don't say it's over with for everybody i just got started in one when i heard this message because revival to me is not shouting glory hallelujah and hoopla that's wonderful that's after effects revival is when god is revealing his word and i'm saying thank you lord so there's silence in heaven when he looks down those in heaven are looking down right now come on do you want me to get in the prophet's message with it he said mom was looking over the banister this morning he wants to do that they know the thunders will sound for the thing pretty soon who's he talking about amen i know we'll do it with the two witnesses to the israel and i know we've had a rejoicing time bringing it to the gentiles don't you but what about you and i receiving the same message by way of the prophet that the same voice of god is speaking right amen see they took where brother around and says thousands of little voices thundering out which is in the church age book right and they made a doctrine called the seventh under virtue but you see that was before the seal never broke over the thousands of live forces i think there ought to be thousands who live foreign if god ever speaks to your heart my revelation you'll know that's right see what does it matter about the vessel that's used amen as long as the ultimate end is reached that's right a good old baptist brother preached all you do and word indeed do all in the name of jesus christ and i said thank you lord i'm going to the water because i can get there as quick as i can get with brother molten say i'm ready come on let's get in the water the good old bag is creepy what does it matter about the dumb donkeys and the things you know as god spoke to our hearts go ahead what are we gonna we're gonna try this little pores standing somewhere anybody he's the only one you will find you the is maybe is oh bye well is is is he's the only one okay is uh is is remember our brother-in-law peggy's sister's husband he had to have a crooked bypass the other day and so you just remember to pray he's still in the hospital there in north carolina just remember his name is damon just keep him in your prayers oh you love me oh hello oh oh foreign
