TRANSCRIPT
========================================
y'all doing all right today wonderful warm day outside yeah yeah turn the proverbs somewhere fifteen sister Regina's brother prayer request coach so let's just pray over that now about our heads Heavenly Father we pray Lord that whatever the situation is that our sisters come upon Lord that you would intervene Lord we know that the prayers of the Saints will be heard quicker than the angels so Lord now we come to you with the petition to go to that situation and take care of it Lord we know you're the one that can soothe all the anger and shoot the hurt you're the great healer you're the great Redeemer you're the great one that does all things for us and Lord we pray that you take care of that situation be with us today morning keep us safe keep the Wilds of Satan away from us Lord so that we can learn more about you let our thoughts be upon you father and nothing else let your words be made manifest in our life we ask these things in Jesus name amen Proverbs 15. good to be back thank brother Bob for taking over thank all these brothers for stepping in and um taking over and doing a doing a wonderful job amen so we're still on Christianity we're just going to kind of go through the Book of Proverbs we're going to kind of read some quotes from the prophet and our theme my theme this year is live me a sermon okay so Proverbs 15 verse 32. he that refuses instruction now he wasn't that it's on going on just one time but refuse it over and over again he that refuse it the instruction despises his own soul because remember if we don't take correction guess what we're a bastard child we're not even in the household of God we're up we're we're a child that was that was formed from not the creation of word and spirit right okay you get many amens out of that it's a true dating him he that refusesth instruction despises his own soul amen okay but he that heareth reproof heareth every Sunday every Wednesday at home listen to tapes reading your Bible but he that heareth reproof geteth understanding amen the fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility all right so that's a that's a big amen to that but now look at verse 6 of chapter 16 and see how this happens by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged because iniquity is known to do better and you don't do it or knowing that you're doing something wrong and you continue to do it everybody understand that if you know you're supposed to do something and you don't do it that's just as much iniquity as you going out and sinning knowing that you're sinning because you're withholding that's and I think that's our problem is we don't we withhold a lot of things that we should be speaking of or acting upon or or in our daily walk or our daily life sometimes you know them and the footsteps of the righteous or order the Lord but you've got to walk the footsteps right he's not gonna walk them for you you gotta walk in the footsteps the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord but by Mercy and Truth not a lie but Mercy which is Grace by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged we've been preaching on purging all right um they really enjoyed the story of the catfish out and I mean the Crawfish out in in Kansas because it's a really good analogy or an example of a Christian Life where we got to purge all that old stuff out by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil Evil's there we depart from it all right when a man's ways pleased the Lord he maketh even his enemies you remember what Abraham Lincoln said oh uh one of his cabinet members stood up and said there are enemies in the South we need to we need to stomp them out we need to to go down there there are enemies they don't think like we do they they're just they should be they should be governed and you know martial law and all that and Abraham Lincoln stands up and I believe the words of wisdom came from that man he said let's make them our friend yeah and the guy was so blown away he said how in the world should we make him a friend there are enemy there he said if we make them our friend they're no longer our enemy see that's the way we look at it is we want to cry if somebody's against us we want to crush them don't crush them try to project God to them right or or you know even in just human life just just trying to project positive to somebody that's negative you know but it's things that we do in in Abraham Lincoln I'm sure reading the Bible he got that from scripture because he was a very merciful man he could have really you know he could have really done a lot of bad things to the South but we know that that he started reconstruction and got down here and and built this thing back up but you see the better listen verse 8 better is a little with righteousness then great revenues without right better is a little with righteousness everybody know the song little as much when God is in it labor not for wealth or fame there's a crown and you can win it if you'll go in Jesus name there is a little with righteousness than great Revenue without great without right a man's heart devises his way see but I quoted this here that's why it's coming to but the Lord directed the steps all right a man's heart divides his way but the Lord directeth his stats and that's why I think we've I'm just going to be honest with you I think we've become as message Believers we throw the Bible out we throw the Bible out and quit reading it and just start being a bunch of quoters nobody understand that that brother Brown had to walk in a in a world that was different from anyone else we know that but was it was an example for us to walk in in our ability we none of us are going to be prophets like he was a prophet or have the gift like he had but take the gift away he was a good preacher take the gift away he was a good preacher he lived a good life it wasn't that the gift covered everything he had no he was uh because remember what the uh what the what was it Danny Henry got up and prophesied and that was the Lord speaking through Danny Henry they said it's the hard way but it's the way you chose which is my way so so brother Brown had to make a choice he had to make a choice which way to walk and he chose to as we were talking about last night it was you look at some aspects in his life and you think well man here he is on his on his uh wedding anniversary he's always out hunting thinking of me then then one time he does take her and he almost killed gets him killed by leaving them in that Shack you know to freeze to death and God put them back together but he would run in and grab his hunting clothes and leave well you think well that's not a model husband that's that was his gift that was his operation of one man I was telling said Street he said well that was one man out of 100 million that could act like that and be formed that way but you and I still have to look at the life that that man lived that's what the people in the Pentecostal World said they said we can't touch his life right we don't believe his Doctrine which is we know that's wrong but said we can't touch his life his life was an exemplary life and that's what you and I that thing right there that statue of perfect man that's an exemplary life Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but stretches I have what in other words what I am what what the building I am because remember they have the faith of the fathers right they had all these virtues working in their life now that's what we've got to get to until we until we get to that you can forget adoption you can forget learning about the seals because you've got to come to a place sorry to the faith of the fathers where these virtues are working in your life right then the seals will open to you I'm sure you can get them in a partial form sure you can get them in a in a minute form in a small detail but brother random had to come to the faith of the fathers before God could open anything else to you yeah because you know what God's not a respecter of person he's not a respecter person brother Brown had to come to a level yes go where when he went across it beyond the curtain of time remember when he said if you watch he's positionally placing himself because he preaches adoption in 1960 but he goes across the curtain of time and he says well where's Paul or did Paul make it and the angel said yes Paul made it he said well if Paul made it I know I'll make it because I preached what Paul preached well Paul was at the faith of the fathers so he was positionally placing himself showing where he was in the scripture if Paul was a Son of God that would that had the faith of the fathers then brother Brown was at that in 1960 well then God could open then the spoken words Original Seed he could teach him Daniel 70 weeks he could start teaching him into the seals in 63 but it was a growth process we don't just automatically because we go to little George I understand everything about seals now you got to understand about Statue of perfect man first you got to get the new birth first before you start getting these virtues now see some of these virtues could be working in your life and you'd be walking in justification and sanctification that's true because and I appreciate our brother claude's about the former latter rain because in Joel it says you get the former latter rain in the same month well the former Reigns the teaching ring right you this is where you get in your you get in your water you're getting your teaching all right then you're going to have a ladder aim which is a harvest rain it's going to be a harvest of what was taught you it's going to be harvested and one day we're all going to be harvested off the Earth if we're born again we're either going to be buried in corruption and raising incorruption or we're going to take a body change right here one of the two there's no in between or either you're going to stay in the grave and you're gonna have to go to the white Throne judgment and give an account for the what you've done and I don't think I'd want to I want the merchants here I don't want to have to wait and try to get it over there all right but you see that that purging time and that is a purging time either either death is going to release you and Purge you or you're going to have to be purged while you're standing here or you're going to have to be purchasing the tribulation somewhere along the line we got to be purged and and then the foreign latter rain then you take the former ladder rain in the same month it's it's impossible to plant corn the first day of of April and harvested on the 30th of April in the plant world it's totally impossible to do it in 30 days you've either got a 60 or a 90 day or even 120 days for some crops to come to maturity but Joel is promising us that in the end time that we will have a form of rain and a lot of rain in the same month so it's going to be a very short work so we can come to maturity a lot faster see it wasn't required that Luther what required that Wesley come to maturity as what God's talking about here with the prophet anybody understand Luther had to come to the majority of justification the just shall live by faith jury come to that maturity but that didn't that didn't Harvest him off the Earth in a body change right he had to go to the Grave he's waiting took his purging time in the ground in the grave buried in corruption and then he's going to raise when we call him out of the ground he's going to be raised up in incorruption and there he'll stand in the glory of what he was taught and what he believed for his time but you and I can't do that you we can't throw it to another age we don't have another age we don't have another time to say well if we don't make it if we don't make it that group will no we can't do that anymore we got to realize we're the only ones left and if it's a requirement like when Richard first come down here um Richard Roberts he didn't Daddy was preaching on statute of a perfect man hey brother Brian I mean it's actually perfect man book says this is a requirement this is required to have these virtues working in your life well Rachel said nobody ever told him that was a requirement he just thought that was something brother Brown priest and it was a good sermon and you know you understand what I'm saying but that's gonna be one word off right well there you go you got to have the whole thing one word off got us out of the garden that's why all these people say well we don't need Daniel 70 weeks and we don't see they start parting this out well what they're doing is they're taking their part out of The Book of Life they just don't know what they're talking about God if you take a part out the Bible says You Take A Part out so if we take down to 70 weeks say well that's just to the Jews and throw it away and we don't have to understand it right then we're taking part out of the buck and I thought John eat the whole book he didn't even pay his land on the floor he didn't leave crumbs laying around he eat the whole book right so we got to eat the whole book so we do have to understand Daniel 70 weeks we do have to you don't have to understand it like maybe um that does but you gotta understand it for what you can understand I think our problem is and that's where we get to this iniquity part because it is inequity to know you're supposed to know that and do that and don't do it that's why the Bible says in the end time that iniquity the iniquity will abound the love of many will last cold because the first seal the mystery of iniquity man of sin sitting in temple of God show himself to me as God message Believers that ain't born again that don't live a life out there that's worth anything we're going to manifest and brother Pinkston really like what he had not really read that scripture in John where Jesus said that um as John 5 I did it in a sermon where you had to prune off the branches that were not any good he says so you can bear more fruit not just bear fruit I can leave my I can leave my plum trees along or tree alone at home and it will bear some fruit but there's so many limbs right there's so many cares of the world kill I'm just gonna have a little bitty Plum on my tree but if I go out there and prune off that's why circumcision is the type of the Holy Ghost it's taking off the excess skin that you really don't need the world all right and then you bear more fruit so you take it that's why you prune a tree you prune a tree so you can bear more fruit you say well that don't well it's the Bible right it's nature it's the Bible Jesus said he said bear more fruit and I just fruit bear more fruit and that's the end time we've got to Bear more fruit than anybody else in in any other age so my my point is I look back at Peter James John and all those back in the book of Acts and if I'm not living to that standard then I'm still down at the bottom of the pyramid nobody understand and that makes me want to my desire is is to walk by a man and him him be um you know sitting in a wheelchair and just walk by and let man just look at you with compassion and you look at him and go man I can't pay for your hospital bill let's let's take it up to the 21st century because that's what that's what Peter was saying Peter was telling that man that's that was sitting at the at the wall there gay called Beautiful he looked at the man and said silver gold silver gold have another in other words I can't pay for you to get better I don't have the money to take you to a hospital all right man in the wheelchair I don't have I don't have money to take you to Shepherd's spinal clinic and let man make you better silver and gold how about none but such as I do have I give unto you rise up and walk you can't you can't buy that with money that's right but if they can do that we should be able to do that right we should be able to come to the place and we don't have to be message zombies sure we got lives to live we got life we got every day everyday works and things to to live like we were talking about last night we're talking about subjection if the last not under subjection to her husband brother Brown see she's out of the will of God sorry that's what the prophet said that's what the Bible said so if you go against that you're committing iniquity you commit iniquity so you know better that's a hideous sin and you're gonna have to get that fixed but two remember we were talking about the men on the other side we've got to give account for for you you ain't got to give an account for us but we got to give an account for you I got to give an account for June and what she does even if she does something wrong I have to give an account for it she and I have to clear that thing up same way with God God's our husband we're the wife and there are things that we do in life that God's not pleased with I don't know about you but there's a lot of things in my life I'm not even pleased with unless that's what God's not pleased with okay so take it to my point if I'm not pleased with it I know God's not pleased with it times a billion all right so there's things in life that you and your wife are not pleased with each other sometimes and that's okay but you work through it just like God he works through these things by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged and what does purge mean cleanse or get that thing out and don't let it come back because the Bible said the worshiper once purged in Romans has no more conscience of sin you think man my conscience is full of sin that's where my conscience comes from is in my I'm sending him that conscious Realm but is it a sin against death or is it just a sin because you're falling human being living life right that's what Dad was trying to say last night that's what I was trying to say sister truly made a point good point but but but look at this you got these over here in this extreme that says my wife shouldn't be barefoot and pregnant keep all the you know wash all my clothes and keep all my you know blessed God shoes dog meat on this side that's true all right on this side over here you got the strong-willed women that they control everything and they want to control everything and their husband lets them control everything that's not good over here either but if you bring them both in here like this take a little of this and a little this and put it together brother random always said about going down the middle of the road right always take and like these life lessons that we're trying to learn and I hope we're learning to be better Christian all right I want to be able to live a sermon I've set up and tell you all day long how to be good but if you see me go you know say something bad or or excuse me or or you know not be good in Life or not pay my bills and stuff like that then what am I doing I'm doing a very thing that I'm telling you not to do I'm committing iniquity because I know to do better and I do it anyway and we do it all the time there's a lot of things that I don't want you to get discouraged but there's a lot of things that we do do that we know we shouldn't do but repent repent turn around that was just a simple sermon um watch night that brother Jason preached but it's very profound he said repent means if you're going in this direction and you're doing things wrong and you got things wrong and it keeps getting wrong and wrong and wrong he should turn around and go in that direction is sin right quit it turn around go in a clean Direction a different direction okay and we as human make mistakes a lot but that's very profound because you know what we do you know what iniquity is don't you we keep going in that direction insanity doing the same thing over again and expecting a different result a drunk does that you talk to an alcoholic an alcoholic says no I won't get drunk this time I won't get sick but at least barfing into porcelain toilet saying God I'll never do this again and then the next day guess what same thing happens he's expecting a different result and that's what the devil wants us to do in everyday life and all these things if we're doing things wrong go in that direction try this try this way what I'm saying with the Bible read The Book of Proverbs The Book of Proverbs is just wonderful for life lessons and and you know God didn't leave us to where we did not have a way to learn to live in this world God didn't it wasn't surprising that we were in laodicea and this is where it's going to happen no he equipped you to be in this age Lutheran Wesley I'm like that I don't believe Lutheran Wesley are probably even Paul could stand it in this age well brother random said Paul will be in jail before the morning that's right he tells the place Parks what'd he'd do but see we have more grace and truth now where we understand the age you understand the age that we live in we have cell phones when we have computers and but it's like brother Pinson and I were talking about we've got all these things to make information faster we've got all these things to we've got microwaves and we've got uh now we've got uh um closed washing machines that takes 15 minutes instead of 30 and starts cutting all this time down but where's our time John Wesley's mother had 17 children she sat down for two hours every day and you know what she done she washed 17 kids clothes probably by hand by hand yes oh no they wouldn't they weren't in the Westinghouse back in the 1500s sorry there was a Westinghouse but it was a place where they sat down and Western that was about it there was no refrigerator she had an ice box somewhere that definitely Hoover was not invented at the time or or you know vacuum clean Electrolux or anything that wasn't so she had to sweep the house 17 kids she had to raise 17 children two hours every day she sat down and taught them about the Lord they didn't want to take a while be like a buffet line you'd have to start at 11 and get finished by 12. technology took more than two hours to do that laundry yeah but she held her sanity and she uh John Wesley a church age messenger and Charles Wesley one of the greatest songwriters of Christian songs ever known those two brothers came out of that and they were just fine so what I'm saying now is God knew that our time would be taken up but he also knew that we'd have time to to to study on the Run that's what I call it study on the Fly driving down the road even if you're washing clothes even if you're taking care of the baby you're studying there's things coming to your mind that how God does this and how you know you see God in this and you see God in that and go to the airport and he looked at all that heathenism going on down there and and you start any but you see God right but you see the grace of God coming to you and you sat there and you and you see those people and and you wonder how are they surviving in this age we're barely surviving knowing our end right knowing what's going to happen we're either going to take a Rapture are we gonna go to sleep and then come up in the resurrection but we've gotta we we've got a an eternal destination they just are there they're just there most of them are just there they do not know where they're going where they came from it's just a and to me that's Insanity they're insane because they're living a life and then everything that they've got is just going to be like job said a vapor here what is 70 something years do you know I know some of y'all are older than me but I just turned 53 Saturday 20 years from now I'll be 73. just 20 years I'll be 73 years old in just 20 short years so where's time went where's time went time has just went and some of you young ones need to think about that I know we know that the end time's coming close but you still need to think it what if this thing does I would have never thought I'd been 53. I mean Joyce was not even talking about graduating because in 77 the Raptor was going to take place you know so we weren't even going to graduate high school but how did you leave that re-graduated and we got kids graduated and we got grandkids here all right dude did it make you leave a Christian Life knowing 77 no that's what I said that's why I no man knows that they are ours it didn't it just made us have fear yeah right instead of prepared hi George I mean we lived through that it just made us have fear then you know when it didn't happen we continued right on here it is 50 years from it almost now and we still the people during that time probably half the people that thought 77 was gonna be it they're not even the message anymore they went off and gone into something else thank God that that um that he preserved some of us to make it and to be 53 years old but what I'm saying is about life we need to open up a little bit more and say look God you knew where I was going to be I know I'm in this but like Junior and I was talking about coming up the road a few minutes ago we when we were doing the Dave Ramsey thing we sat down and saw our finances well two years later after we were in our first class our finances have changed so we got to sit down and redo it well the same thing with God say God well my path is not the way I wanted to go we sat down and look and just see what see what God says I think we talk too much and don't listen we talked sometimes it's best to listen to God just listen and let things come to you right that's right I mean really just just in the United States and God I need this and you know I need this and I need this well he knows you need that right right he knows you need that just sit down and listen sit down and listen remember what we're talking about today listen I'm telling myself today but listen listen to what God has to say that's why I wanted to kind of drop back and just do and we may start back to the Statue of a perfect man because sister Regina made a comment about going back through it so we may do that but do you have someone do you have your quotes we're going to read just one if you don't we'll uh we're gonna read it anyway it says lend me a sermon we're going to read we're going to raid second page earn a certain sound 1955. I've got some here I got one we didn't have these I'll make some more copies but everybody should have them and eat and bring them or either just stack them over here and you can leave them here but 1955 uncertain sounds Jeffersonville Indiana brother Brown said look at the underlying part every man and woman that ever had it come back to Holy Ghost knew they got it no uncertainty about it every man that's born of the spirit of gods knows when he passed from death and their life knows the place the hour the minute when death changed to life when unbelief of the Bible changed to believe every word of it when haughty high-minded things passed you know what the word high-minded means you know the Bible says we'll be heading high-minded lovers of pleasure more high-minded means know it all that means you can't be taught anything that's the worst right can't help it that's the word no you can't help them you're right they've cut theirself off but but that's why I say open yourself up and and sometimes we think we got things figured out yeah come on I'm one of them I think why I got this figured out and that figured out and maybe that you'll find out you ain't got nothing figured out right how minded things pass to Humble Christian they know when death casts to life amen every man that had it had something different the world knew it you know sometimes you don't feel like a Christian but you know somebody walked up and said hey I appreciate you I appreciate your stand for the gospel I appreciate the word that you brought I appreciate this or appreciate the the testimony that you give well that's God telling you through somebody else he ain't got to say it in all the boys he can take you through somebody else I was telling boss this morning who told Moses he's going to be a deliverer his mother told him that read your butt read the prophet yeah said from the time that remember Moses was put back into mother's his own mother raised him inside the well see his own mother was in the Palace of the Egyptians the world but she wasn't out of the world she wasn't Egyptian right but she raised her kid in Egypt but she kept telling him you're the deliverer you're the one sent to deliver Israel You're the one that's gone what God was telling Moses drew his mother that he was a deliverer all right then God spoke to him when he got older but raised up a child the way it should go and when he's older you'll not depart from it the world knew it every woman had it had something different in the world knew it the world can see it your actions prove what you are you can say you got it but your actions speak so loud that they can't hear your voice your life speaks what you are somewhere we're going to manifest what we got inside of it we're gonna have to because this is manifesting time we're going to manifest one way or the other so I just want us to this is why I want to do maybe another couple of Sundays and then we'll start on maybe stack you a perfect man you know why because security that's correct that's what we were talking about in Kansas I mean in uh yeah clogged Sunday night they had a new girl there that had been just coming so I dropped way back and started with the corn of wheat coming up with two shoots then the stalk you know justification about the Holy Ghost but you know what you go out in the field you go out in the cornfield because the corn the corn when it starts looks just like any other weed see when you're Justified you look just like any other person you still have that same spirit in you but you begin your characteristics begin to grow because see you don't cut it down right here because you cut this down and the bad stuff down but you just wait a little while let it grow up a little taller it will have the characteristics in it and it will look different than the weed plant somewhere it will evolve into that corn plant which looks totally different from the weeds because most of the weeds are going to be short and here this big old corn stalk starts coming up and then guess what at the very end you're going to find that one thing's for sure if there's corn on the end of the stalk it was a corn plant to start with but if it wasn't it's not so let's go
