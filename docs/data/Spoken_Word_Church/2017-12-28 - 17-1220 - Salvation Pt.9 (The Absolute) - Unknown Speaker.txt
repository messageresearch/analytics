contacts and they're trying to do the best they can so if things don't work out too good it'll be all right to them we can get it back up and pull it up and at least get a audio out of it maybe if we have to do the things but we hope everything will run in the right direction they men we appreciate everything my wife and I want to thank you very much for all of the gifts that you gave us and the things our Sunday it was really nice and doing things like that and we certainly do appreciate it Terrence has made all the announcements we'll be meeting this coming Saturday one o'clock and that would be our Christmas time there'll be no service then on the 24th because Christmas and your time together with your families and all like that and then we'll be coming in to the watch night service and getting all of that into order so just remember these things if you sisters want to you always do I know Terrance it's nothing about if you fix food or what you want to bring it in and if you want to get your a little bit of early you can come in and kind of snack around a little bit before we start the service and then we'll get down to really some good eating after the service is over with but looking forward to brother long and the message and the Lord would bless us and we've had a wonderful year so to bring it to a close would be a great thing but now we appreciate it amen but if you like turning your scriptures turn to Jonah two and nine and then we'll go to 1st John one we're already getting phone calls and things that this ain't working well sorry about that do the best we can to get everything to working you know that John will go to - Jonah first and we'll go to first John one you have any father we thank you for your grace Lord and your love unto each and every one of us thank you for all the things that you've given us Lord this has been a marvelous year wonderful timing you Lord and we're coming down to the gaining of the closing of the year but we're looking for whatever a moment to seeing that the coming of the Lord and all the things that we Lord know that I right ahead of us we look forward to it we praise your great name just bless all of those that are not here tonight I know sister Esther still having problems with their operation and everything so just reach down and touch these all the others all the ones that are not here Lord we pray that you would bless each one forgive our sins and guide us in Jesus name okay we've been on Jonah 2 and 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the feast and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land let's go over to John and kind of pick up this and I hope to get this far to where we can deal with the two parts it will be but would be in John 1 and we'll start reading at verse 4 of John 1 then we'll go right on into reading in John 2 okay and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message now once this this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you the God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from what from all sin well I thought we Christians didn't have no sin I thought that's what everybody thought maybe we've missed a point right all right now watch if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us going to chapter 2 now my little children these things write I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for our sins only but also for the sins of the whole world you may be seated unless they would go ahead but just go ahead that'll be far enough if we get there anyway but now we've been talking about salvation and saying what it means and looking back in the Old Testament that salvation coming to the new I thought that the day would be the ending of the services you know on that say the Old Testament we begin into the New Testament but I want to make sure you don't misunderstand me and what I'm trying to express unto you so it shouldn't be any problem for me to repeat myself you know bringing it on into the right thing and all these cell phones are sure hidden or denied no problem yeah we talked about an unconditional covenant in talking about salvation you know an unconditional covenant now ask the question and repeatedly ask the question there the life service about what is an unconditional covenant he said well it's just a covenant with no conditions well that's does that leave it then I'm repeating back over to make sure you follow me does that leave it then that we can just live like we want to you know and still say that we're saved I thought the way we lived and the things that was in our lives had a reaction or action back upon God and his ways and and things and I don't want you to get lost in thinking about something and so you just say well well it's an unconditional covenant we'll just remember now first off see you can break it down and watch our point now he made an unconditional covenant with Abraham and his seed all right but that had nothing to do he made no covenant Darr about eternal life it couldn't come forth right eternal life could not be in question in the Old Testament form because how could it be how could you have eternal life before Christ had ever come to pay the price I mean is that sensible or there's a common thought that should have been in our thinking all the way through that surely we wouldn't in any way think well well you know I know that I have problems now and we all have problems and and and you think you don't have problems and and you think you don't do wrong well if you're going to say it that way may I agree with you because that it puts you in two classes as you order sit down and listen if that's the situation you're trying to condemn me with you're admitting where you're at I'm sorry that's brother to hell you you're admitting where you're at if you're trying to condemn the other person or bring that person to a position of thinking about well none of us are perfect no we're not perfect but if we're forgiving then you never done it and what's more perfect can be where do we get down to the little word righteousness and see what it really means but think about it now remembers I said he made the Covenant Adam in the land and the things and Adam failed he's picking up showing it toward the seed comes over into Noah and it's not a promise about giving a certain amount of land or anything that's done been saying it was from here to here to here and then when he comes back to Abraham he just refers to that because if you read in Genesis you'll see that this they had that place and it was set aside and the way whether it's the river Euphrates run out and went down and all of that land all right so it's not talking about salvation it's typing salvation it's the type of salvation for you and I we're not interested in land we're not interested in all the seed doctrines and ideas we're interested in the Word of God all right so all of that just a time coming down to where we are all right is everybody with me now all right see now we talk about and we say quoting it did Adam had a coven of the conditions that bug stays up there and has Noah had a covenant with conditions who we say well Abraham had a covenant a broom or whatever you want technically he said well he never had no conditions would didn't could he live just in any life in any form and still be alright I will remind you that the children of Israel which comes down from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob then he's changed to Israel the children of Israel were sent into bondage a lot of times am i right I thought it was unconditional the come on they lost the land to get it back they'd lose Atlanta get it back now just remember they never lost your covenant they lost the joy of it the happiness of it the dwelling of it but yet they were in bondage constantly and even prophesied in the Covenant that we talked about to Abram in Genesis 15 and told how long they were going to be under bondage brother dado I thought I understood a lot of things until you start talking what do you know what that means my brother al said one time he said why don't you look over and let brother Dale talk you out what you believe this is because we can talk you out of it it's not a revelation right good point but think about it now was Adam and Noah on a conditional Abraham unconditional so yeah that's what the Prophet said amen see they love stur part of dwelling but they never lost what God told them they would have which was the land number one they might not have it right now but when they were down there under bondage in Egypt they could say Abraham our Father says we're going out of here and we're going to get that land well you know what they did it they might have lost it because of sin right but they got it back they will get it back knee in time right there's our nail and our president just made it to her Jerusalem would be the capital no other president no were would attempt to do that if I differed with him and everything in the world I'd hug his neck for that I'd want him to twist his hair Oh decide where we get stuck with it but that's all I see is her ain't got none you don't want to worry about all right now listen it was never made with Abraham and them as a point of salvation are you listening it was typing salvation you know until my eternal life coming in time the end it was a promise of the land and the seed all right and under that promise that kept emphasizing it under that promise they had a place to go to when they died the place go paradise right all right but now did you catch the point of trying to emphasize the life service that the code that was never made with nobody but Abraham and his seed hey come on now listen don't think I don't know the scripture you know I said thank to the Bible says you know that the nations will be blessed because of you they are the nations of the world today are blessed because Israel is here but that don't save them and that don't make them part of the Covenant all right so don't just run out ahead then you sit down and listen I'll cover that when it gets because I like to pick them things out because I can see them you know I'm kind of get to contact with the people with it with that okay so it's not made with everybody because salvation is not made for every now whatever come on salvation is for everybody right but how come nobody how come the people won't have it right we're gonna get to something in a minute let's think about why did he make it only with Abram and really technically he takes it from Abram now if you want to go through the scripture we don't have moanin internet we kind of put everything we can on there where somebody else could pull it down but we're not gonna use the board as much all right but just remember he made the promise to Abram and his seed right specifying that his seed would be Isaac and not a small Abraham but around said we gave it there only makes each other day he had 11 children sons and daughter our sons it's more than that there was no problems today it was only to Abram the Isaac to Jacob and kept coming down to Joseph coming through and coming out to Christ right we'll get to that later they're true Nancy it's not promised to everybody you said you don't know it's far everybody but everybody won't have it right anybody can have it if they'll it accept it but now my emphasis has been one thing why did he give April now to say Abram because it technically was Abram until they bruh happen why was that given to him and no one else I come up there with a whole world full of people don't you think there's some good people in that time why did he not choose to give it now listen okay here comes another one of them little truth why was it not chosen to give to one of the prophets well he could have moved he couldn't okay why was it not chosen to give to one of the prophets now we believe Abraham was a prophet right because the Prophet said he was okay that's what I believed it because I can't read the Bible that he was but I believe it but why did he give it to Abram and not to nobody else in the world you don't mow those things through your cranium cap that's the reason I like to hunt because I'm not listening to this and listening to that and everything else I can sit down just think and just sometimes have a good time Lord spoke to me Tuesday going down let's see what's a Monday and I got about halfway down the road I said Lord I could turn around drive back home go home visit happy I'll go down there and sit and have a good time I don't care what kill anything or not this helped me a good time because I've already got what I wanted it's what he spoke to me about alright then we'll put that together the Lord willing this coming Saturday and try to bring the point all right but listen why would God give it to Abram there's some reason I mean is that right there's some reason that he gave it y-yeah why didn't he give it to Noah you know the Bible says we don't like Noah too well but you know the Bible said that he wasn't up just an upright man he was a truly believer in God why didn't God give this unconditional covenant to Enoch I'm just asking a simple question I just want a simple answer there's got to be some reason right now God never does anything without a reason we'll get to it we're brother Branham said you know if God ever repeats his step so when he said that verily verily I say unto you you know what brother Owen said you better listen there's something right there that when he repeats itself Lord spoke to me and he said I thought well that's in the scripture I checked it out is exactly four of them you know but why did God give to Abram an unconditional covenant and we've already our should have already established within our thinking if not we won't establish it anyway so that's all right then he's not saying Abram I'm gonna save you I don't care what you do is that the kind of is that what we think that's a good old Baptist once saved always saved now how could it be on that basis when if I'm quoting brother Branham you've got error - for one person anything another person receives it reaches that same position he's to give it to them RS he done wrong to start with huh now if he gives it to apron why didn't he give it to a nook if he gave it to and why didn't give it to know why didn't he I just want you to think to get away from our dollars you say yeah I never thought we could just get by with anything well why would you want to talk about an unconditional cousin what was the reason that God chose Abraham or Abram what was the reason you know God never does anything without a reason but why does he do it - what he does it I thought the reason that God does everything the same all the time - word that his word would never you know mess up her cross each other or whatever and it would come out into perfect order that was what I thought about it I thought that way then whatever he says one time if we put it on free moral agency of a covenant and I'm looking to quote and we put it in the wrong way then what are you gonna do with Adam what are you gonna do with Noah brother Brown says if he gives one something and don't give it to the other one see your work you're one of these days you'll listen to what I try to say to you without trying to figure it out grace was before Adam Grace was before Noah and grace was before Abraham and if there was ever any salvation old or new God before the foundation of the world could predestinate that to take place for the time and how does God predestinate not by desires now cuz he deserted everybody B say anything predestination according to the scripture that says those who he for no he did predestinate I like know better than you you know because that new means like something evident but no means a personal I know I love that whenever a funeral joke said I know my Redeemer liveth do you know are you just knew about a redeemer he's just heard the story he's just listened to the tales that's been told you or do you know the charisma God and did he cannot cross his word that's right he can't tell one person one thing another than another one we said what what he did without a brother and he did what would know of them know because grace has done to her come on you didn't listen to the message grace was already there before Abraham come on the scene so Abraham say by grace through faith what snore saved by what was that him saved by my grace through faith conditions of Noah in Adam the condition was to stay away from the tree did you listen stay away from the tree of knowledge and by the time he comes to April he's a neighbor I want to give you an unconditional cousin and we're gonna put up with that old tree of knowledge they'll take care of that but me and you going down the road without it okay how does God did predestinate does he predetermine something to take place or does he know what will take place now which is this which is the story does he predestinate it or does he know that it'll take place and then by knowing that it will take place he can turn it around and bring it for his own honor and glory right he make it work out so the Covenant is an unconditional what Israel you still got that land you just gonna have to wait a little longer and Israel your seed he's over that right now and there's not just one hundred and forty-four thousand of them gonna be taken out and brought in to the point of did you you got to feel feel Jew you got a lot of Jews that are gonna be dealing with salvation somewhere down the line I hope you followed the message I didn't know the thief killed you well I thought your prophet said it was Israel from Calvary to down here and what about that group Paul was talking about that we're blinded so you and I could come in they haven't lost anything they've just lost the joy of their covenant now if God predestinate by foreknowledge you agree with that you need how many times you need brother parents say that now look what ago I forgot what it is but it's somewhere around fifty something times yet he uses almost that direct quote and they're probably about a hundred on top of the attitude an interline with it that called predestinate before knowledge then Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated oh he loves her he loves Pikmin he hated he so that's what he said that's really good you know he knew that Jacob was not gonna stay Jacob he knew he'd be Israel and he knew all the covenants and everything would come and he knew that seed of Abraham would come through there but he knew exactly what he saw would do okay so something triggered God ever what you want to use the word for between a hey Jacob and Esau something triggered God to choose Jacob and the hate he saw what was it what caused it how could you just don't understand brother Dale which chosen why did he choose you we'll get to that we're not in the New Testament yeah we're headed in a way why did he choose you if he predestinate spy for knowledge then he would have some reason and basis to put Abraham right there what is your predestination oh I just believe God predestinate certain people this way certain people that way then you're exactly in the line of all organized religion and things that's predestinated my god choosing what he wants and rejected what he don't want why did he choose Abraham I said you talk about all but brother then would he instead Abraham an unconditional covenant will want to give it to it come on we supposed to establish the point that he surely couldn't give it to him to just say go live like you want to Abraham everything's alright and your descendants Israel he's gonna follow that mine first time they get in trouble they're put in bondage gives you listen in a minute ago the children of Israel would put in bondage because of their sin why would the commandments deal so much I know the story no children visual chose law okay they chose loves they didn't get what they thought they thought they got a book of Rouge they didn't get a buckaroo they got a revelation Jesus Christ that's what your prophet said us now all right ten commandments what is the commandment say says it's all right for you to steal what I ain't gonna count it to you are if you cheat lie sorry I'm here to commit adultery Rock if you do all these thing cut angle account it to Yuma I'd like for you to tell me why God didn't account David's sin or any man cinder what didn't he account the sin of Abraham mmm-hmm why was it all into Abraham and his seed if it was unconditional that would put God choosing Abraham and his seed and rejecting mankind right how does God predestinate anything he predestinated about his foreknowledge didn't he knew what Abraham would do alright that the words of the Prophet I gave you three quotes off of it last week or the other day he said Abraham I know him he said he'll teach his children why did he choose Abraham they must have been something about Abraham that he liked but ran him on the message Shepherd of the sheep fo he said and I thought of that about sheep and Shepherd why did he choose David David non-reading was always talking about steel waters in green pastures he was the psalmist that wrote songs and played on his heart to the glory of God and he must have been something about David tending sheep he must have been a real shepherd why did you save it he said yeah if your unconditional covenant I'm trying to get that to you to the point why did he do it Abraham an unconditional covenant he didn't give it away our thoughts and ideas of unconditional exists that's what I've been trying to prove to you he didn't do it he had a reason for choosing Abram see we can vote with what God just chose me I didn't choose him why did he choose you there's something about you you don't never think like that there's something about you that God likes we just quoted he liked David because David said on the heel and sung to the Sheep you know God loves music good music I do too David would always talking about steel waters and green pastures maybe when these days we'll figure out why the Bible said that David was a man after God's own heart and God ain't no adulteress and ain't no murderer so he surely ain't that so it ain't an unconditional covenant like we think it's unconditional in the basis that can never be taken away now are we here it doesn't mean while you're at it in it that you're not gonna have trouble it means it cannot be taken away I never took away Adams God never talked away to no us goes grace it already entered the picture he never took away her Abraham of the promise of the land he's tired he never took away his promise of his seed it's unconditional not in the basis and she can live back to devil and get violated but it can never be taken away I don't care what the world does I can't take away that man that God promised him we walked over there in places and in that that Israeli God he told me they had found his new place that they had led Jesus when they were leading him up too after taking him and whipping him and gonna put him in the tomb and he said Sam he said we just discovered these things right here and he said this is where they walked with the Lord Jesus everybody else is looking around at the trees and paying attention to everything I went walking up in you know what I said I said the devil you woke my master this way what that but I've gotta promise so I'm walking on you ever were the footprints coach is going to be mine and I'm walking on you tonight oh boy I had a lot of good times in Israel saw the sit healed it's all kind of thing are you listening you can't take away a covenant that God gives you said yeah but you can lose it no you can only lose if he gives it to you you're only gonna lose the effects of what it is now are the points you know it's what I'm trying to get you to see this rule was put in bondage many many times but they always came out that's an unconditional covenant to me that God can't lie he said that's girl and that girl and he said that's his feet and that's his seed we'll get to Christ one of these days you City Christ has kept his covenant it's got to be all right how does God predestinate back at foreknowledge so for some reason he looked down through and looking at Abram he's seen him one of our problems but looking at the end of the story you ever heard this one said wouldn't it be nice to be like Abraham and said I'm quoting Greta said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief it was strong and believing yeah I like to way that Gerson Solomon rabbi rich when I guess one he said talking about Abram and all of those things of in line and something like that to a message he was talking he said ain't no way that a Jew would tell that story like that if he wasn't led of God to say it because he'd never put Abram in that line why is it only to Abram and his seed if it was unconditional there was some reason that God chose Abraham maybe one of these days you'll look up and you'll see sometime how many times that we've talked on this how many sermons have I preached that there's a certain scripture related to each one of you you can't pull that out into your thinking and think about the scriptures that are related to you you never had him to speak to you a personal point about of Scripture and it be related to you what are you doing here today why are you here why are you in this message why are you an outcast a scum of the earth yeah we don't fight nobody we don't argue with nobody we don't first with nobody about what they believe right we'll just go on believing right you don't ever think you don't ever sit down some down and they say Lord why did you save me what fit Wow LeBron said God knew Abraham would teach his children so what did Isaac get teaching from his father kind of hard huh it's been hard to be an Isaac to lay down on that ground like that now I've come and ask you it but then when it was finished all the way back there's what 25 miles back in the woods 25 miles three days running or something what about Abraham explaining all the way about Jehovah Jireh to his son that has just been laying there with his throat very and open he says daddy you really love him don't you Abraham said yes so he said daddy you loved him enough to kill me than you yes son they'll remember the rest of Scripture don't just throw him away remember the rest of the scripture says because he knew that he had received him as from the dead and that God could return that again I like the way brother Richard Wilson says it years ago I remember him say it he said what if Abram later Abraham or Abram had to went ahead and just burnt Isaac slap-up said the scripture still rhymes he's got more than he had before cause before he had a dead woman and a dead man no hopes or whatsoever if he had a spoon full of Isis that was left in that fire he had more than he did to start with the Bible said he didn't worry cuz he said if he was killed him he said he's gonna raise him up now remember if you want to scripture you were to read some time go back to where he told Sarah are the people that was thorough ever said it is and what'd he say the lad and I shall go and I'm coming back with Isis in a part know what that wasn't exactly what he said he said the lad and I shall go in the lad and I shall return so ever were somewhere if he had a spoon full of Isis tommy walked 25 miles he's gonna have Isaac that's God's promise why why did he do that with Abel God made an outstanding statement about him he said now I know you love me you could've said before night Abram Abraham everyone he said woman yeah I guess you love me cuz you went through a lot of time but he said now I know you love me because you're willing to put your own son to death to fulfil what I said to do I'm glad he's never requested that again cuz I wouldn't have a problem I guess wouldn't you but listen God knew what Abraham would do that's before the foundation of the world right so then his choosing had to do what Abraham would do after he got here uh-oh we struck something on predestination that don't ring a bell to good you're saying that something we do or don't do I didn't say that I said it's something that God does through me and you you don't think why did God choose you you know that brother random talk about how that he had to breed this one to this one to this one to this one - that one to this one and all to come down with a blonde hated had he said blue-eyed little girl what about God breeding all this together to bring it down to a little people called a bride you realize that you're sitting here to not prove predestination you had a choice of being anywhere you wanted to I know some of you know you don't know your mind and what you think you'd like to have a pastor that is more powerful and explosive and dynamic and glowy well that's good if you want it with you find this one and we'll stick him in somewhere we got these other brothers going we'll put him in somewhere I enjoy those things too but you know what a lot of times I enjoy just sitting down thinking yes what brother Dale you make it to the basis that we think that we're doing something good about if it's done automatically what are you worried about it all right and I thought all the Christian are supposed to do everything automatically I didn't think that we had any problem then we got to Christianity but sure is good how does God predestinate by his foreknowledge he knew what Abraham would do statement for later on he believed God nobody else wouldn't believe was anybody in the days of Noah that would believe that was gonna rain Oh world Bible says as it was so is it now seven trillion the seven trillion they're all kind of fancy different this that the other and the only one man would believe it was gonna rain and he looked down into Noah and he said no I told you that a hundred and twenty years ago and said not one day since then have you just believed me oh that's change the time for three times I started out to preach on the seed of Abraham you know put a clean conditional covenant explained marking that out then I put an advocate because that's where we read down John if you don't think you do wrong what do you need an advocate for the president ale I don't think we've got it explained now we know that it's not me it's this it's this body and spirit we got it all explained now thank God it's the truth with that me does that mean I just let this body and spirit just run any which way I that the new birth is on the inside I thought Christ in us is what keeps the body and spirit under control I don't that was what Paul was saying when he said two things I would not I do he comes through a long list of things talking about a Christian walk not someone if we bad this used to teach that those guys were and explain how it would be to get saved they wouldn't explain in salvation I'm sorry that doesn't work Paul was talking to Christians and explaining himself not as the Baptist t-shirt or did that Paul in Romans until he got to the seventh eighth chapter and I like that was not born again he never heard those things but then he finally comes to a place did he get saved in their things age chapter now the books written to Christians Paul is explaining that every day walk he explains it perfect because in his finality of finishing up his story he said then it's not I from the inward man he said I served the law of God he said but from this outward man he said I served the law sin said that is in this flesh was Paul a sinner yeah no you don't read the scripture where were in John one and it was explaining that if we say we have not sinned and we're not a sinner and there's just that the other jump over to the third chapter and you'll find it'll say this whosoever that's born of God does not commit sin because his seed remaineth in any minute cannot sin who cannot see in the seed not the parson right the person can do home I wasn't when it wrote the book the Prophet was talking about in the Hebrew series about that man you know it was a preacher and he quit pretty soon him sat down and started drinking beer he was talking about a Christian he said Godhead take his child home he said coach wouldn't let him ours not what about some of those things see we don't want we want to hear a soft soap Pat had it on the head kind of a doll or something we don't want to listen to all things we want to just take what a little bit we won't we want to follow it just the way we think about it you know that might be the thing that God is looking at it he don't like you've got a choir what if he's looking at what we thought all of this time was salvation to us and says it's not salvation we'll get to those things as we cover along a little further but I hope you following the unconditional covenant it means it can never be taken away from you once it's given unto you right that's what makes it unconditional it don't cover the sin you do because you're gonna reap attack for is that what's your prophecy he said sent us in as a Christian Reaper doubtful yeah but you didn't scratch me Kay not saying well then your prophets wrong so let's turn off the message forget it is that the way you want what about when he gets on the adoption he said the Christians is the only one that sins yeah but I don't worry said see you're fighting you're not listening you're only fighting to refute do we sin every day run around him Hebrew series chapter 6 ergo 262-264 knew we've seen every day yes Paul said he died daily now what is Paul mean he died daily - what - that one that was making him do what he was doing oh listen Romans seven in you see him every day but what about it what about it okay if you got that until jump over to number five can you pull that up in a hurry weary continuing for the faith if you could pull that that far if don't now quote it hey the worse at it is in e6 but made the statement at the carpenter kills the whole body coming down trying to find one thing to bring the human adam sinned destroyed the world come on up and see if we can find it down I guess we get this off there's none without sin every day you sin Oh said he had to die daily if we say we sin we have no sin we say we sin and have no sin then the Bible says we make God to lie and we could not do that so we sin daily in its grace God's grace that saves us and as we confess our wrong yeah the Bible says to confess our sins right that's what the Bible says well we don't have it do you realize what you're doing see then you say that's not a Christian so you're moving that out of this picture if we confess our sins he's honest and just to forgive them yeah but I I just don't see how that you can stand up there and blatent lycée that a Christian sins I didn't do it your prophet did the Bible did I'm just quoting what I say because if we say we don't see and we make him a liar Paul explains it come on I did a second ago so to a Christian where is sin I've always tried to preach it to you for 50 years to get you to see it a Christian cannot sin with their soul it's truly born again Joyce their body and spirit that descend Wells within but to say I don't seeing that I'm a liar because I am a sin in that point but just remember this one now if you have the inside one that cannot sin then you've got an unconditional in the right way in the right way you've got it right now if what if you believe that in that soul it's sealed off from Satan and truly eternal by the baptism when the Holy Ghost and that one that's within there can't lie cheat steal etc but the outside man can do wrong and if we do wrong what is it in the communion we do wrong we do wrong every day no brother dad I'm a Christian I never do wrong okay well right ahead I'll only say one thing and then try to finish the thought you know what's keeping us here what's keeping us here fifty years after the Prophet won a little word called unbelief we can question that with that starts all right we want to argue with you about it we just leave it on one time why has God not come and honored his word wide it is rolled state 40 or 30 technically it rolls on over a little bit more over but why were they 400 years according to what he said to Abraham and then 30 years it's technically if they're closer to 40 was added for them to study why because they didn't believe Moses to be the one to take them out they rejected him right and thereby they got at least 30 years going on the word forty years because of their unbelief do you know what God never run off and left him you just let him pout it out and put under bondage for 30 40 years he sent Moses right back down why because he had already said in his word he'd do it they'll come out with a mighty hand and a nation that does these things will be annihilated look at Egypt when they walked out of that they had everything they could get on the Bible said they raised it which means that would just they just totally annihilated Egypt as a country why because God kept his word if we do no wrong then why do we need an advocate you know what it is to say that you have an advocate it means one who stands in your place or takes your part you know really what you're saying the Lord I won't this advocate do you say that I don't need to raise a hand I might asking you do you really need an advocate the Bible said which is Jesus Christ the righteous now no see and he don't need one and you realize if you do away with an advocate you do away with part of God you're denying him the right a full manifestation of how that he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a redeemer he wanted to be an advocate because he knew we'd needed so when you say you don't need an advocate look what you're saying you're doing away with it now watch though there's a reverse to the store remember then if you say you need an advocate and you won't advocate just take it means you've got a reason for it state it means you're admitting that you need a Savior what about it yeah but I just don't know if that korabik I've been taught all my life that a Christian cannot sin you ain't never studied this message sinners condemned on a higher level he's a sinner only Christians can sin that's what's your profit see it we're the only ones who need an advocate we're the only ones that needs a comforter with the only one that needs those things go today doing the center no good I like things that the Prophet will say sometimes it really amazes you until you think it over you know you know that you're not saved by the blood now that's a you come down from the Methodist and they'll shoot you about that because you're saved by the blood blood saves you work show me the Bible the blood save you alright the Prophet made the statement I admit it took a while to get that old Baptist thought out of there but you know what once he got it out I could have a little understanding a little understanding of salvation that could be imparted to me that would follow it I would see it I'd understand I don't understand the Bible the Bible doesn't say you're saved by the blood the Bible says you're saved by grace through faith [Music] that's the Bible then I like the way the Prophet said it he said you're not saved by the blood he says you're kept saved remember that you're kept saying because that blood incorporates every dipti blessing that that son of God had within him while he was walking the shores of Galilee was because there was the blood of Almighty God healer Savior Redeemer advocate comforter what about it cap saved by the blood what I said imagine this would hang you for that because everything they had in their day was built on the blood and I ain't throwing off on the one of them because that was the day of the time all of your songs about the blood was written in the day not all of them come on you know what I'm talking about the days of John Wesley it was the other one Charles wrote the songs everything in that day was about the blood the songs of the age was about the blood brother Brennan says we're not saved in any way by the literal chemical blood he said we're saved by the life that was in the blood then I got to life it's in the blood now listen close the hole taught off then we'll start a little better later an unconditional covenant God's not gonna take away what he said he'd do thank God for that he's not gonna give it to you and let you live like a devil and not because I don't let's see what is it other scripture whatever Sunday come with the garden must be what chastened Oh why he's the sort of car chasing it he might not die with the sins of the world right right why are you chasing your children why do you correct your children to get them to live right and what the prophets say about Abraham he said all them things had done wrong which said when Paul finished his commentary about the life of Abraham said he staggered not at the promise of God that was God looking at Abraham that was not Paul looking at Abraham that was guard looking at him now before the foundation of the world what was garden looking at ended right here what was God looking at before the foundation of the world was he looking at all of the problems and heartaches and trouble to the world sure that's it for knowledge he would know that with that pleasure but he was looking at the end of the road when it would all be finished in Jesus Christ unconditional not to go out live like the devil you are the devil but unconditionally and it can never be taken away from me we'll get to that on the baptism when the Holy Ghost come once you do it what is receipt of Abraham brother one said it's the baptism with the Holy Ghost which there's more to the seed of Abraham that's why all these people got these seed doctrines you don't never hear him talk about Abraham and what that seed was you just try to make it something that makes me to where I'm okay instead of making it what the word says God kept his covenant with April changing to Abraham change his body brought him forth brought all of the things they would show salvation to the Gentiles possession it would bring him forth and he'd manifest all of these things why would you a human mind want to think about that he could get Bible sin oh I didn't see that I didn't see that in him why would anybody any thoughts ever want to develop in your mind I pray every day Father forgive me forgive me Lord well you were to get to the place you don't need to pray so much but I hadn't got there yeah then I don't worry about it either every prayer I begin in the end is with Father forgive me because I know I do wrong I know out problems but I know you said what you do and I'm glad you're not looking down here at what I'm doing through life as I said he didn't look down to see what Jesus Christ would do on earth sure that was there he knew but he looked what it meant before the world he's gonna save Abraham and his seed after him now how do we become the seed of Abraham he said by faith that's wonderful how do we become the seed of Abraham what classifies you and I as the seed of Abraham what would classify us is the seed of a pariah no are we right that's what it's got to be oh come on folks we talked to this new Baptist Church that we would have seat of Abraham by faith right now I mean you sitting around now don't know what to see the vapor around the edge I thought the seed of Abraham was to do the works of God we got a lot of scripture a lot of topics come on is this you a lot of thinking about it why do we need these things if we don't do wrong why did God put him in his word if we don't do wrong why would we not want him to fulfill his attributes and display all of those things when I know I needed Paul said I die daily so if he died daily that meant they was wrong in his life you can do what you want to what you're thinking he had something wrong in his life or he wouldn't have been dying I die every day - Father forgive me cleanse me Lord forgive me no trouble when you get down to the river I wanted everything to be right but I want it to be right not wrong go ahead brother what we got listening do you need an advocate then these Jesus Christ the righteous do you have an unconditional covenant that means there's no way into it so when he started that with you in the new birth you don't have to worry about it does that mean I can just get by the ain't got to get new birth why would you think that why would you even want to think that when God has done so much to make you and I to the place that we need to be and why would we think it's okay with God you know he knows I'm having problems we said he had problems too he did but he never let them problems get in his way what about you go ahead brother well with all the flood [Music] he surf arm in their ears just remember Hannon richer than all the sickness and they won't get on the kids and thank me well what we believe [Music] God gave him [Music] all the way amen [Music] remember the message about six months ago I'm trying to preach you back [Music] the Bible said it's not whether or not I'm chosen it's whether he's Joe and I went around joking it's whether he's chosen it already whether or not he was chosen because then it can be transmitted to me I'd say who i predestination God before the world sat down and looked and seen our lives see where we would go and what we would go through to come to the place that we are listen any knows nobody can take your place [Music] now that's a word you know but ain't nobody can take your place he chose nobody can take your place [Music] we just make him believe in you if you have to take care of it what he's asking for you babe we'd like it in Jesus [Music] Oh I hate wasn't far god [Music] by the father [Music] on the way [Music] requested a prayer cloth for his neighbor's artist a lot of problems the year the problem solver you're the one that will take care of every time we believe it so we send this burner phone Pro to be done no matter what the devil she is it's a finished product we love you Father thank you in Jesus anybody else [Music] when rejected from Network Oh [Music] I hope you understand what I've tried to say an unconditional covenant it's not something that you can just get by with anything and do what you want to live like the devil and everything be alright but it means if God gives it to you he can't take it back that's what I mean by an unconditional covenant if he gives it to you you can't lose it but just remember as the man in the Hebrew series God won't let his child Mars name you may get taken off the scene if you won't straighten up Dhar is what we need to be concerned about if we won't follow after him we may lose in a short journey and you know what if we don't follow after him we're all going by the grave I don't care if we're Christians or whatever we're going by the grave somebody has got to believe it and stand here and call for it before it can be made manifest it's done been saying the promises are dire we don't need another message we don't need another Bible we need to believe what the Prophet is brought to us and he Curtis all the way that's what that man sitting in my house that day he said brother Branham laid the foundation he said we build a church we do something I said well I ask you one question you know simple little question you say brother Branham laid the foundation and you gonna build the rest of it right I said what according to the Prophet brother branham priestess all the way to the future home the eighth day now if you gonna tell me something tell me pi-star you get it if you gonna come and build something it's gonna be pi-star then and you know what he didn't say no more what would you say it there's no way if somebody comes to straighten him out then he wouldn't right we ain't go we're about that far in RV we're gonna rejoice in what we've got and believe it and just think about it those children of Israel I remember Wade preaching on that one time about years ago and they would come down to that night of the communion the Passover thing and everything had to be set in order aired this had to be there that had to be fair they had to go through all of the young the cleansing the situation and when they got through they left one chair at one place in one cup you know who it was far it was for Elijah and they'd get up and they'd open the door he didn't come in they'd say I forgot how the term was it another year you know another time he's not here yet well I think we ought to be thinking about this a kind of the end of all things in order to be finished and believed in it because you know what we're running out of time whether you like it or not old age is gonna get a lot of us I thank you another day I said lord thank you for these young guys coming in I said these ministers is raising up these people the Deacons are people of the church the young people that are coming along they can take this thing home I'm not saying that I'm through that'll be the day he finishes it but I'm saying there's one thing about it we can't keep going long it's gonna be something has to happen pretty quick if you don't you know what we're going by the great I mean that's normal that's not decreased you know nobody when I said that back to 40-something years ago 50 years ago that the Lord showed me the biggest force of people this man's gonna die and go by the great people got upset with me about that still get upset with me saying I had no disrespect to nobody no thoughts of nobody but there's one thing about it those that have died are in the ground waiting on me and you we can get upset have our feelings heard about some little something they just won't stay in that ground until we get to the place do we say Lord come quickly come quickly and get us out of here does you know what they died in faith those that are sleep in Christ Jesus any brain with it they died in faith ain't be Christian out of nobody if I say God told me and 40 50 years ago the records proved it was told you shouldn't get upset about me saying it now what you ought to be concerned with one time am I ready am I ready or do I need to go by the grave got out one of the other that's sensible that's didn't need a revelation you don't know how yet or whatever that's plain common sense and I don't mean cause you were young that you gonna live a long time I don't do that it's just the basis that God always raises up somebody to carry it on father we thank you Lord we praise your great name and your honor and glory we thank you for the understanding Lord Oh an unconditional covenant means you're gonna finish it means it's not over with means it's not on the basis what we do or don't do yeah it's on the basis what you've already done but then if we don't line up what you've already done then we prove who we are then we're now late ourselves from the hope of glory because we don't believe it's what you said is true be with everybody on the way home give us a safe journey that everything be all right in you we committed to you in Jesus name [Music] freedom we are now in a stay over your hearts to God saves from the chesty seek to wait headwinds drop Bridget away [Music] many will me [Music] [Music]
