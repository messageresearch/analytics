[4:59] she's she's laughing at it she's gonna
[5:02] get me there
[5:03] all right you Brothers help me out it's
[5:06] Paradox to me I was listening to brother
[5:09] Brandon some time ago he was talking
[5:12] about he and his wife went shopping
[5:15] and he said after about an hour or so he
[5:18] said
[5:18] my feet started to hurt me and I I
[5:22] thought I said well now hold on just my
[5:24] own brother
[5:26] this is this is
[5:28] a man with the spirit of Elijah
[5:32] who who goes into the mountains this is
[5:35] a man that walks 30 miles a day yeah
[5:37] yeah and yet just one hour with his wife
[5:41] his feet were hurt
[5:43] so I told my wife I said sweetheart if
[5:46] brother Brown 30 minutes
[5:49] five minutes in Walmart my feet are hurt
[5:53] but she she know that's just you know I
[5:57] I like the teacher that's all right but
[5:58] we're certainly thankful to the Lord I
[6:01] a couple weeks ago I know you had your
[6:02] sweetheart banquet and Brother Joseph
[6:04] was telling me by the way you did a
[6:06] wonderful job and I guess many of you
[6:08] all were there with your sweethearts
[6:10] so wonderful and I understand he started
[6:13] on a series on relationship and marriage
[6:15] and how beautiful that is and how needed
[6:19] that is in this hour that we live in
[6:21] that's right but we we don't get too
[6:22] religious to that's right to give out
[6:24] our families and to to to know our
[6:27] position right that's it and we're
[6:29] thankful to to the Lord that we've had a
[6:32] message that has come to positionally
[6:34] places
[6:36] so we're thankful to the Lord for those
[6:39] things well it's been a few years since
[6:42] I've been by and uh
[6:44] uh you know 16 years ago the lord gave
[6:48] smoke to a Brother Joseph Canada my
[6:51] heart we were down in uh we're over in
[6:54] the sunset Mountain we've been praying
[6:56] about missionary work
[6:58] and the Lord spoke to our heart
[7:00] not going to Venezuelans and you know
[7:02] the last time we were here and we showed
[7:05] the videos and things we
[7:06] uh we didn't know if that was the
[7:08] country or not because we found out
[7:10] later that they spoke Spanish in
[7:12] Venezuela and we we didn't have any
[7:15] Spanish and so we thought well surely
[7:17] God wouldn't send send us to a country
[7:19] where we don't know the language right
[7:21] but his wonders to perform
[7:25] God you you can't figure out God
[7:28] his thoughts are higher than our
[7:30] thoughts all right but we're so thankful
[7:33] uh brother give me God bless you I see
[7:35] you there too we're so thankful that
[7:38] after 16 years of missionary work in
[7:41] Venezuela God has not only a Venezuela a
[7:45] few years ago we were over in Guyana
[7:49] Georgetown Guyana and we flew up to the
[7:52] Northwest Territory of Guyana and was
[7:55] there for about a month and worked with
[7:56] the Indians there with a brother named
[7:58] Desmond Ross
[8:00] we were also been going back and forth
[8:03] to Colombia for Bayonne Bogota those
[8:07] places we've just come from uh bull
[8:10] Vista and manaus Brazil and uh brother
[8:13] Dale's just in Brazil not too long ago
[8:15] and so we we see that God is he's
[8:18] Gathering his people come on man but I
[8:21] can tell you after 16 years of
[8:23] missionary work God has turned the
[8:25] corner amen and God is as brother around
[8:28] him said once he said the move is on for
[8:30] the bride that's the strength and so
[8:34] over the years I remember brothers and
[8:37] are we going down the Orinoco River
[8:40] there and we still go down the river we
[8:42] got two uh message church and the Deep
[8:45] Amazon jungle Juan Pierro one Yana mommy
[8:48] Church there we work with those and
[8:50] brothers I have constantly going back
[8:52] and forth
[8:53] and then not so deep in a place called
[8:57] Puerto ricuchi and uh Southern Venezuela
[8:59] the state of the Amazon when we first uh
[9:03] started there when I first started going
[9:05] back in 1998 99 with Brothers there were
[9:09] about 30 or 40 tribes that we would
[9:11] visit but now over the years uh that
[9:15] kind of
[9:16] kind of dried up
[9:18] and and God began to separate
[9:22] and now I'm out of all those tribes and
[9:25] those 20 groups that we used to visit in
[9:27] Puerto ricocha actually the Indians the
[9:30] cost of civilization and transportation
[9:32] that's come in it's preventing those
[9:34] Indians that believe this message to
[9:37] actually come to the church there for
[9:39] brothers I have pastors and so we see
[9:42] that God he's it's not
[9:44] running
[9:46] without a message that's right right
[9:48] it's not being enthused
[9:50] uh over the years
[9:52] it's more than that amen and God has a
[9:56] five-fold ministry that's right that's
[9:58] led by God I see it amen God is not a
[10:01] hit and miss this message is not hit and
[10:03] miss that's right this message is
[10:06] directed demand to a predestinated
[10:09] people
[10:10] that that happened near to here you see
[10:13] and so now we're the we see that God is
[10:17] really dealing now with the maturity of
[10:21] the Bride yeah exactly and that's the uh
[10:25] on the mission field that's what's going
[10:27] on with us really teaching brother Brown
[10:30] says teaching places the believer
[10:32] positionally what they are in Jesus
[10:34] Christ amen and how important it is in
[10:36] this day to know what you are in Jesus
[10:40] Christ who you are and what you've been
[10:43] raised up for and we're thankful that uh
[10:46] so when we look back over the years of
[10:49] the missionary work and seeing how God
[10:52] has uh blessed us over the years
[10:55] open doors we're thankful that we can
[10:57] look back and see evident fruit of the
[11:00] ministry right and that God has I
[11:03] remember going uh maybe a year a couple
[11:06] of years ago
[11:08] and we're missing at a certain place and
[11:10] they said brother Andre you remember the
[11:13] brother here said no he said he was one
[11:16] of your first converts I said no he
[11:18] wasn't my convert he would have been my
[11:21] comfort he would have fell away a long
[11:22] time ago
[11:24] yeah but we see those over the years
[11:26] that have been steadfastly minded and
[11:30] the broadcast to every woman in the
[11:32] Bible that represented the broad had to
[11:35] be steadfastly minded right and had to
[11:38] make a clear-cut decision amen all right
[11:40] and we see that in the life of Rebecca
[11:42] Rebecca she had to make a decision
[11:45] brother round preseason time of the
[11:46] decision right
[11:47] and God had been grooming her sure man
[11:50] working on her building character in her
[11:54] before Eliza ever got to her you said
[11:56] and so when the message came to her she
[11:59] had to make a clear-cut decision right
[12:01] Ruth had to make a clear-cut decision
[12:03] when the prophet preached that message
[12:05] Kim's one's Redeemer he said now Ruth
[12:08] her very life is in four stages like a
[12:11] Believer she had to she had to choose
[12:14] she had to decide and she made a
[12:18] decision and she told Naomi where you go
[12:22] I will go where you Lodge I will Lodge
[12:25] amen your people will be my people if
[12:28] your God will be my God Amen and where
[12:31] you die will die she had to make a
[12:34] clear-cut decision right because she was
[12:36] only a type yeah right and the type is
[12:40] never greater than the answer type and a
[12:42] greater than Ruth is here tonight
[12:44] and so we see Esther and the different
[12:47] women of the Bible because God uses
[12:49] these women of the Bible
[12:51] it might be Sarah
[12:53] it might be as we said uh Esther a ruse
[13:00] Rahab or Tamar or Hannah or Hattie
[13:05] Wright yeah right man God uses those
[13:09] women right time of the church all right
[13:11] amen and so we're thankful that people
[13:14] have made clear-cut decisions and and we
[13:16] see on the mission field now uh some
[13:20] just genuine articles of God right right
[13:23] there you go and that's so wonderful
[13:24] amen not in not in quantity but in
[13:28] quality
[13:29] and as I heard the brother said and we
[13:31] were speaking this weekend
[13:33] oh Jesus asked the question will the son
[13:35] of man Find Faith right when he returns
[13:38] to the Earth I'm thankful that he'll
[13:41] find Malachi for things right right when
[13:43] it returns to the Earth because it's
[13:45] Malachi 4 faith is the very Faith Of God
[13:48] himself it's translation Faith right
[13:51] it's rapturing Faith right it's it's the
[13:55] faith that when Jesus saw that Roman
[13:57] Centurion
[13:59] and he came to Jesus and he said
[14:02] now Master Lord I'm not worthy to come
[14:06] under your house
[14:07] said but I've watched you I'm a
[14:10] centurion
[14:11] and I have people under me I say go they
[14:13] go I say come they come
[14:16] and I've seen you speak to Spirit
[14:19] sicknesses yeah death right
[14:22] and your minister is different than the
[14:25] Pharisees or the Sadducees or the
[14:28] herodians amen
[14:31] he said if you'll just speak the word
[14:33] yep right that's Malachi for Faith speak
[14:39] the word amen and God speaks that word
[14:42] and so we're seeing that kind of quality
[14:45] of faith on the mission feeling amen
[14:48] amen that's just so wonderful when you
[14:51] see that there's no headquarter around
[14:53] the earth there's no organization by man
[14:57] it's not man LED right man handle it's
[15:01] all God and how beautiful it is when God
[15:04] is in the business and when God is
[15:07] taking care of those things amen and so
[15:09] we we still continue our work in
[15:12] Venezuela all across Venezuela I've been
[15:15] able to minister and and all of the
[15:17] states the 23 states there in Venezuela
[15:19] and that's just for the glory of God you
[15:21] understand all right God would take this
[15:24] insignificant negro and send them to
[15:26] South America and all these countries
[15:28] and things that's for his own good
[15:30] purpose he said right and so we're
[15:32] certainly thankful that we can report
[15:34] back
[15:35] and not just us I Wish Brothers would
[15:39] come it would be different he could tell
[15:40] you some of the great testimonies and
[15:43] that way when Jesus said if I bear
[15:45] witness of myself my witness is not true
[15:47] not that he was saying anything false
[15:49] right but he said the father he will
[15:52] bear witness exactly and so I love that
[15:55] that those other missionaries can come
[15:57] and share with you but I will share one
[16:00] thing with you that over the years have
[16:02] been
[16:03] have been very special to me and that's
[16:06] to see the people our Spanish book
[16:09] brothers and sisters
[16:11] have access to the message right when we
[16:14] first went down to Venezuela they had so
[16:17] many books so many tapes
[16:19] then after some years of going and me
[16:22] and different missionaries seen false
[16:24] Doctrine come up and different
[16:26] missionaries representing their ambition
[16:30] or right or their pet Doctrine and and
[16:33] our wonderful Spanish brothers did not
[16:36] have that the the access to the message
[16:38] as it were to to respond to that right
[16:41] when people would come down and say you
[16:43] know brother Robin said this and rolled
[16:44] around and said this and we believe this
[16:46] and that and too many times they say
[16:48] those things not placing them in the
[16:52] scriptures this message is script to it
[16:55] amen it's in the scriptures you see amen
[17:00] everything that the prophet be just
[17:02] right there in the scriptures Glory it's
[17:04] identified God identified all right
[17:07] right
[17:08] and so when we see those things and our
[17:11] precious Brothers not have that the
[17:13] access to that you have here with all
[17:16] the material and the resources that God
[17:18] has provided
[17:20] we should be very thankful right right
[17:23] and we are you know and so that has
[17:26] always been something very important to
[17:28] me one of my heroes was a man named
[17:30] William Tyndall yeah and when your
[17:33] Tinder was a great man
[17:34] then the 1500s he spoke seven different
[17:37] languages and he could speak those
[17:40] language so fluent that no one could
[17:42] tell exactly what his native tongue was
[17:45] you see right and so one day William
[17:48] Tinder was looking out the window
[17:50] and he saw the the farmer plowing
[17:54] and he knew the curse of Rome and the
[17:58] Nickelodeon how they would refuse the
[18:00] people to have the language the Bible in
[18:03] their language but something struck
[18:06] William Tyndall amen and William Tyndall
[18:08] said if God gives me the strength I will
[18:12] translate the Bible that even the farmer
[18:15] will be able to read the word of God
[18:18] and he did that
[18:20] he surely did and the Catholic Church
[18:23] tried to stop him but not until he had
[18:26] made so many copies when they finally
[18:28] called him
[18:30] and there in Belgium they took him to
[18:32] the stake
[18:34] burned him at the stake yeah and I say
[18:37] we're burning him he was singing victory
[18:39] in Jesus
[18:41] amen so what what opportunity we have
[18:45] right that Bible that you have did not
[18:48] come without price
[18:50] exactly blood lives were given amen that
[18:54] we have an opportunity to read the
[18:56] scriptures and know who we are
[18:59] and recognize who we are right
[19:02] right and so to make make this long
[19:04] story very short
[19:06] brother Luis chirago
[19:08] he asked me said bro Andre I'd like for
[19:11] you to come to Mexico with me
[19:14] it's been about how many years ago with
[19:16] Seth Rollins
[19:19] around 2004. and we went to Mexico and
[19:24] we met a wonderful Pastor brother
[19:25] Australia then Monterey Mexico
[19:28] and while we were there brother brother
[19:31] Luis was speaking to brother Australia
[19:33] and brother Estrella had all of these
[19:36] messages
[19:37] of in Spanish and I think it was a word
[19:41] word form
[19:43] and uh Word document form and so I said
[19:47] brother Lewis get all the messages you
[19:48] can get
[19:49] get everyone you can get yeah and so he
[19:52] got all the messages but they had
[19:55] translation errors you understand
[19:57] because the just the quality was not
[20:00] there but he got all the messages
[20:04] and I told I call Brother Carl harms
[20:07] who's been a sponsor of us and and our
[20:09] mission work I said brother Carl
[20:13] there's something on my heart he said
[20:15] what is it brother Andre I said brother
[20:17] Carl you know our Spanish believers they
[20:21] don't have the opportunity to look up
[20:24] quotes the way we do in polio View
[20:27] he said well what do you
[20:30] what are you thinking what's on your
[20:33] heart brother Andre
[20:34] I said maybe we can get these messages
[20:38] in the same format of the folio view
[20:41] right and so he said I'll contact the
[20:44] companies it called talk to Brother
[20:46] Joseph Brother Joseph Canada I talked to
[20:50] Brother Joseph and talked about putting
[20:51] them on the PDF format I think
[20:54] different things and so
[20:56] we brother Carl said I tell you what
[20:59] we'll we'll get the same company that
[21:02] built the folio View for the spoken word
[21:04] the voice of God
[21:06] and we did and he did and he sponsored
[21:09] that and we had 600 messages on folio
[21:13] that the Spanish Believers can look up
[21:16] quote but there are so many there were
[21:18] so many errors so I asked brother George
[21:21] Smith
[21:22] I said brother George what do we do he
[21:24] said take the hundred and sow good
[21:27] messages that we know are clean
[21:29] and you're gonna have to start from
[21:30] start over
[21:31] and so we got brother Antonio Velasquez
[21:34] our interpreter and and Venezuela real
[21:36] Caribe and a couple other brothers
[21:38] brother juancho another brother out west
[21:41] and and Venezuela and so we went to work
[21:47] the brothers went to work and then they
[21:50] would send the
[21:51] uh brother Antonio when because
[21:55] of the translation so sensitive you
[21:58] don't want to get it wrong you see
[22:00] because this is the work of the Lord and
[22:02] you don't want guesswork yeah see and so
[22:06] brother George Smith would permit
[22:08] brother Antonio Whenever there was a
[22:10] question
[22:11] would send these quotes to brother
[22:14] George and he would prove them send them
[22:16] back so after that after a few years
[22:20] we were able to
[22:22] bring a new disc
[22:24] with about 400 messages all the folio
[22:28] View and we're able to spread those all
[22:30] throughout South America and the status
[22:32] speaking countries of South America by
[22:35] the grace of God
[22:36] and so
[22:38] what happened how tremendous it was
[22:41] because I think two years ago or three
[22:44] years ago we had a call from Brother
[22:46] Ernie Venezuela Venezuela from uh from
[22:49] Brother Mitchell's church he said
[22:51] brother I know y'all have these Spanish
[22:53] messages we need those for the tape uh
[22:56] for the uh oh watch this for the message
[23:00] I thank you run away he said we need
[23:02] this for the message hub
[23:04] so I call Brother Joseph and I said
[23:06] Joseph send them all the messages that
[23:09] we have to put on the message Hub and so
[23:12] it gives me great
[23:14] uh uh privilege to say that this work
[23:19] that God had placed on our hearts to do
[23:21] we're able to hand it off to our
[23:24] brothers and Marcus Samantha brother
[23:26] Freddie pattis and sweetheart what's the
[23:28] other brother's name that works in with
[23:30] brother Freddie the Young Brother
[23:35] and these men are just on fire for God
[23:38] Amen and they've taken over this folio
[23:40] View and they're working very hard and
[23:43] so we were thankful that we could hand
[23:44] it off to them that means so much to me
[23:47] amen I'll tell you why
[23:50] the first Spanish-speaking Church
[23:53] started in marked with Samantha
[23:55] Venezuela there was a brother named
[23:58] Oscar or Oscar galdona who came up when
[24:01] brother Brown was preaching anointed
[24:03] ones at the end time several messages
[24:05] and he came to see brother Branham but
[24:08] brother Branham uh was very busy and
[24:11] brother Perry green came to brother
[24:13] Brown and said brother Branham there's a
[24:14] gentleman from Venezuela he's here he
[24:17] wants to talk to you about baptism
[24:20] and brother Brandon told Brother
[24:22] Peregrine you go and baptize him and so
[24:25] brother Peregrine did he went and
[24:27] baptized brother galdona and after that
[24:30] evening brother Brandon said now did you
[24:32] baptize him he said brother Peregrine
[24:34] said yes sir brother Brown brother Brown
[24:36] said now go preach for him yeah and that
[24:39] was brother Peregrine's First Missionary
[24:41] trip was down to Venezuela and he can
[24:43] tell you all about it but the thing was
[24:46] even though brother Brown had preached
[24:48] in Mexico and different South American
[24:50] countries they never knew about the
[24:53] message they only understood about the
[24:55] healing the first pool and those things
[24:58] but after brother gal Dona had been
[25:01] re-baptized in Christian baptism in the
[25:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ then he
[25:07] began to get the messages and God just
[25:10] changed his heart and the light came on
[25:15] and brother got Donna he had went to
[25:17] Trinidad and and when he was a young boy
[25:19] it's there was uh his father needed work
[25:22] and the economy was very low in
[25:23] Venezuela at that time so his father
[25:25] when I was returning that and then
[25:26] Trinidad he learned his English and and
[25:29] and his English was just outstanding I
[25:31] had the opportunity to meet brother
[25:32] y'all doing and preach for him and and
[25:34] go to his home and and one of the most
[25:37] homeless man you'll ever meet but you'll
[25:39] never know that this man what's the god
[25:42] used this man to take the message to
[25:46] Mexico and he went to the Mexican
[25:48] brothers and they said yeah we know
[25:49] about brother Brown he came here in
[25:51] Mexico City there's a woman whose baby
[25:53] was dead that morning that was raised up
[25:56] there was a blind man you know
[25:58] Miracles but brother gal Donna said but
[26:00] yes but there was a but but there was a
[26:03] message that followed that and so they
[26:06] were able to take the message to Mexico
[26:09] and all the way down through Central
[26:11] America and all the way through South
[26:13] America and I thought Ma how wonderful
[26:16] this is that now how brother God used
[26:19] brother galadona to take that message to
[26:22] the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin
[26:24] America and now that same bark is
[26:27] Samantha God is using young men amen
[26:30] with this technology right to take this
[26:34] message to give the photo of you out to
[26:38] pastors that when people come down with
[26:40] their false Doctrine or their ideas that
[26:43] they and say oh brother Branham said
[26:46] this they can say where did he say that
[26:49] and how thankful we are that we can
[26:53] combat that right that always has a
[26:55] comeback he's done amen Bless the people
[27:00] all right
[27:02] let's always say those things for the
[27:03] glory of God and and and and now
[27:07] you know I I was just thinking uh here I
[27:11] am God it's giving me a wonderful
[27:13] Venezuelan wife and and I'm not fluent
[27:16] in Spanish I I I like for you to think I
[27:20] am but I'm not
[27:24] but we're learning and I speak a lot of
[27:27] Spanish but we're we're learning and and
[27:29] so Lord Lord give us the opportunity
[27:32] Brother Joseph and I and brother Louise
[27:33] we'll be working on some uh a little
[27:36] something with some slides some videos
[27:38] like we did here a long time ago and uh
[27:40] show that to you so pray for us we we'll
[27:43] probably be getting back toward the end
[27:45] of April or the beginning of May we'll
[27:47] be headed back to Venezuela so just pray
[27:51] for us we'll be making some trips uh but
[27:54] a brother Marcio de Yama uh he's a
[27:58] brother from uh manaus and we'll be
[28:01] doing some work over in the the jungles
[28:03] of manaus and also through the city
[28:06] there of announcing both Easter so
[28:08] remember us if you don't have anything
[28:10] to pray about
[28:12] you have something to pray about right
[28:15] so we we thank the Lord for that amen
[28:18] well I'm not going to keep you long but
[28:20] certainly we we've come to glorify the
[28:24] Lord and come to hear his word Heaven
[28:28] and Earth will pass away that's right
[28:29] and we're looking I'm looking at a
[28:32] people like Joshua and Caleb yeah yeah
[28:35] and I'm sure that you've been taking
[28:37] possession because Footprints is
[28:39] possession and
[28:42] this is the time where the bride comes
[28:45] into her full inheritance of the word
[28:48] all right and we're moving there we're
[28:51] moving there by Revelation and by
[28:55] understanding and I'm thankful as we
[28:58] were saying this weekend we're not just
[29:00] preaching a message where we can just
[29:01] come and say amen and your finances are
[29:04] not right your marriage is not right
[29:06] your home is not right this message has
[29:08] come to transform
[29:12] too many times we I saw a sign the other
[29:15] day it said not change transformed and I
[29:18] said Amen to that that's right we've got
[29:21] too many people that I'm going to change
[29:22] but we we need more than that we need
[29:24] power transformation
[29:27] and changes in his likeness Amen to make
[29:30] us like what God had in his mind of us
[29:33] to be before the foundation of the world
[29:35] and I'm thankful that a people in this
[29:37] end time hour have recognized their
[29:39] positions right recognize their calling
[29:41] recognize the the anointing that they're
[29:44] under right and that ego has been
[29:47] released that anointing has been
[29:48] released upon them and brother random
[29:51] says ego that number four living
[29:53] creature that means that means relief I
[29:56] mean that's Earthly Deliverance I mean
[29:59] we how can we do anything except the
[30:02] anointing that dictates our lives and
[30:05] moves Us in the scriptures we find
[30:08] ourselves in the Bible like brother
[30:10] Brown himself in the Bible he didn't
[30:12] understand about his life he doesn't
[30:14] understand about his calling but one day
[30:17] when that angel of the Lord came and
[30:19] said you're a prophet like Moses you'll
[30:22] bring an exodus you're a prophet like
[30:24] Joshua you'll take them into the
[30:26] Homeland your Prophet like Daniel you'll
[30:29] have dreams and Visions you're perfect
[30:31] like Jeremiah your prophet's
[30:32] artilleration then he saw his name in
[30:35] the book he saw his position right and
[30:39] he was able to move and the revelation
[30:42] of who he was and that's what brother
[30:44] Brandon preached when he preached
[30:45] perfectly Faith right he says now Jesus
[30:47] knew the scriptures that was written
[30:49] about him right and he earnestly sought
[30:51] the father that he would fulfill those
[30:54] things and that's that's that's all
[30:57] that's the hour that we live in even
[30:59] with social media destroying churches
[31:02] destroying families in this age there
[31:06] will be births Sons
[31:11] we see how Satan the God of this evil
[31:15] world the god the prince of the power of
[31:18] the air how he's come down through the
[31:20] social media and through this technology
[31:24] and has destroyed families marriages
[31:28] churches relationships right
[31:31] that's why Peter said
[31:35] that our conversation in this age of
[31:38] conversation in this age of
[31:41] communication right Peter said that our
[31:43] conversation and our communication
[31:46] should be holy
[31:48] because God's going to destroy all of
[31:50] this right amen and the Vera eat their
[31:53] ways and the Very radio waves because
[31:56] Peter said that even the elements would
[31:59] burn up with with such great heat amen
[32:03] and so we see these things coming in
[32:07] has loosed these things upon them
[32:14] on the P Revelations chapter 9.
[32:17] John said I saw a star fall from Heaven
[32:22] I saw him fall
[32:24] just saw him fall
[32:26] John saw him fall and brother Bradham
[32:28] said what how Thou Art fallen from
[32:31] heaven or Lucifer but he was given a key
[32:35] and a key gives you access
[32:38] it's knowledge
[32:40] and he was given to him right to unlock
[32:44] the bottomless pit yeah
[32:47] and he had lost the bottomless pit
[32:50] and smoke Rose from the pit what was
[32:53] this this was the Mulligan flux that
[32:57] saint has tried to baptize our children
[32:59] with that tells our family with it but
[33:02] I'm thankful by the opening of the seals
[33:04] to let the spirit of Truth has been
[33:06] loosed upon the bride amen
[33:10] I'm a standard has been risen amen
[33:14] and you're that standard amen amen
[33:17] that's right brother let's just take a
[33:18] few moments let's stay in once more and
[33:20] turn to First Peter chapter one
[33:23] First Peter chapter one
[33:30] these were about about 15 minutes or so
[33:49] First Peter chapter one we're going to
[33:51] start reading it verse two

[34:22] scriptures Lord

[34:30] we are the scriptures this day
[34:33] the very manifestation Lord
[34:36] of what was in your mind
[34:38] and Lord as we see the world falling
[34:41] apart again the world is falling apart
[34:44] and we see the handwriting on the wall
[34:47] and all of these
[34:49] destabilizing other countries
[34:52] because Rome
[34:54] is taking her position on
[34:56] and all these kingdoms Lord are falling
[35:00] like dominoes because it was prophesied
[35:03] to be
[35:04] Lord we see all of these things working
[35:06] their place in order
[35:08] and father we're so thankful that it was
[35:10] prophesied in the end time there would
[35:13] be abroad Lord
[35:14] the prophet saw that preview
[35:17] and he said if there is not abroad then
[35:22] every Vision that I've had in the past
[35:23] has been wrong but Lord in 62 you begin
[35:27] to change
[35:29] the prophets his very view as that great
[35:32] Eagle looking down

[37:27] For Your Glory in Jesus name we pray
[37:29] amen
[37:31] in First Peter chapter 1 starting at
[37:33] verse three I'm I'm sorry two First
[37:36] Peter chapter 1 verse 2 elect
[37:40] according to the foreknowledge of God
[37:44] the father through sanctification of the
[37:46] spirit
[37:48] unto obedience and the sprinkling of the
[37:51] blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you

[37:58] His blessings to the reading of his word
[37:59] keep your Bible you may be seated we'll
[38:01] continue to read
[38:04] we see here
[38:07] Peter he is addressing
[38:11] A peculiar people here all right amen
[38:15] this greeting is not to the world
[38:18] this greeting is not to the unbeliever
[38:21] right
[38:22] screening it's to the elect amen Lori
[38:25] amen those that had journalized engulfed
[38:28] from the foundation of the world right
[38:30] those who even though in their first
[38:33] birth
[38:34] they would have to come through unbelief
[38:38] because of our first pair of Eve adult
[38:42] tricks we would have to come listen now
[38:45] born in a bloodline right
[38:49] of the serpent all right
[38:53] and your natural bloodline they call it
[38:56] hereditary heredity and say well you're
[38:59] of this race and because if you're in
[39:02] this race you're you're you're more
[39:04] susceptible to getting this disease or
[39:07] having that disease that's bloodline you
[39:10] see right right man and you and I
[39:13] we were permitted to come through the
[39:17] bloodline of the serpent right right
[39:19] that's where sicknesses and disease and
[39:24] all of these things are passed down but
[39:26] we're thankful to God that there's a
[39:29] holy ghost there's an abstract title
[39:33] deed amen and they're holders till that
[39:35] title deed here tonight right that can
[39:38] break the bloodline of Satan you see and
[39:42] and that's the elected right this is not
[39:46] the foolish virgin right this is the
[39:49] verb wise version Glory this is the
[39:53] people that the scripture says that they
[39:56] shall not die but they shall be changed
[39:59] this is the elect amen thank you Lord
[40:02] this is those as we said that had
[40:05] representation by predestination that
[40:09] God was going to have them amen and he
[40:12] has them tonight
[40:14] he was going to bring them to maturity
[40:17] by the word and they would recognize
[40:21] that they an inheritance in God Like
[40:24] Father Abraham and we don't have time
[40:27] tonight but Abraham God never revealed
[40:29] to Abraham that he was going to change
[40:31] his body all right he just told Abraham
[40:33] to fall on him and even when he met him
[40:36] as Melchizedek and then an important
[40:39] righteousness to him he still did not
[40:41] reveal to Abraham that he was going to
[40:44] change his body right he was a mystery
[40:47] right amen that was going to be unveiled
[40:50] that was going to be revealed right and
[40:52] it's the mystery to the bride in this
[40:54] last day also you see
[40:56] right and so even even when El shadia
[41:00] the breasted God came to Abraham
[41:05] and when he came to Abraham
[41:08] El shadia in the breast of God he
[41:12] changed his name from Abram which means
[41:15] High father right
[41:20] chained to Abraham Abram
[41:23] Melchizedek priest and King of the most
[41:26] high God he was representing the god
[41:30] Elion and Elio needs the most high God
[41:34] and the most high God came to the high
[41:38] father Abram
[41:40] he was revealing himself right even in
[41:43] his son Abraham right but then as God
[41:46] began to unfold himself down because
[41:49] Abraham by election had an inheritance
[41:53] in God and you and I have an inheritance
[41:56] in God even though like Ruth we did not
[42:00] know that we had an inheritance
[42:04] but blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[42:06] the word has come amen and we have and
[42:10] and as you and I know Jesus did not come
[42:13] to give us an inheritance you've had an
[42:16] inheritance in God before the foundation
[42:19] of the world that's right but he came to
[42:21] redeem us to atone to bring us back to
[42:25] that inheritance in this hour
[42:28] and you and I
[42:30] by being born again
[42:33] it connects us to our inheritance you
[42:37] are by your new birth you are connected
[42:41] to that theophany amen and you begin to
[42:45] be you begin to be brought under an
[42:48] influence not us just trying to come to
[42:51] church well I'm just trying I'm just
[42:53] trying to make it you're not just
[42:54] hearing brother Wayne brother Dale and
[42:57] the brothers preach that message it's
[42:59] it's more than just that was a good
[43:01] message we're talking about inheritance
[43:03] now right
[43:05] we're talking about a people that says
[43:07] look
[43:08] I've been called to this I have an
[43:11] inheritance in God Amen and the Holy
[43:14] Ghost begins to draw you to that
[43:16] inheritance amen exactly that that that
[43:19] that word that you bypassed right
[43:23] begins to begins to make its way by the
[43:27] hearing of the word right because faith
[43:29] comes by hearing and hearing by the word
[43:31] of the Lord amen and that's why the
[43:35] ministry of Jesus Christ was not like
[43:37] the Pharisees because the Pharisees you
[43:41] know they were so pious
[43:43] I was ready to condemn yeah they were so
[43:46] righteous
[43:48] and the Sadducees I didn't even believe
[43:50] in the Supernatural right and the
[43:52] heronians were connected to the politics
[43:55] of the day all right but Jesus ministry
[43:59] what's different than their ministry
[44:01] right man and the disciples saw this
[44:05] different Ministry in the land
[44:07] it was not like just reading the
[44:10] scriptures right and yet it was reading
[44:13] the scriptures
[44:15] but when they saw Jesus
[44:18] and you know the story of the testimony
[44:21] on the sea these are fishermen
[44:24] and they're on the Sea of Galilee
[44:28] and the storm Rises up
[44:30] and Satan says I'm going to destroy this
[44:33] bunch of Holy Rollers
[44:36] I'm gonna get rid of them
[44:39] and the storm builds up greatly and
[44:43] these fishermen
[44:44] who knows they know about storms oh yeah
[44:48] they know about waves it's not the first
[44:50] time they've been in a storm yeah but
[44:52] they've never been in a storm like this
[44:54] storm yeah
[44:57] and they knew we're going to perish
[45:01] they knew that they had no uh there was
[45:06] nothing they could do to control this
[45:08] right that's what they knew by the
[45:12] corner yeah
[45:16] but Jesus who was there for Redemption
[45:19] purposes and his first coming was for
[45:22] Redemption purposes mathematically for
[45:25] the son of mankind to redeem that all
[45:28] right call them back those that have
[45:30] representation
[45:33] and so when they said go away Jesus and
[45:36] he stood up and he spoke to the weed
[45:39] into waves they looked at themselves and
[45:41] said what what manner
[45:44] what manner of man is this
[45:48] I could not understand it oh man they
[45:51] hadn't sit under a Ministry like this
[45:53] before right
[45:55] I had learned this by going to the
[45:57] synagogue Bible study systematically did
[46:01] not bring this to them you said hey man
[46:03] amen they saw a supernatural life
[46:08] and another time
[46:10] Jesus walking by the Fig Tree cursed the
[46:13] fig tree
[46:14] it wasn't even time for the Fig Tree to
[46:17] bring forth
[46:19] it was untimely right yep but Jesus
[46:22] cursed the future he said no meaning
[46:24] from you from this day forever
[46:27] and the next day
[46:31] Peter says
[46:32] how is it
[46:34] that you just spoke to the tree and
[46:37] already it's withered right
[46:41] and his answer was to them was have
[46:45] faith in God all right
[46:47] all right you said what are you talking
[46:48] about brother I'm talking about your
[46:50] inheritance amen right listen now read
[46:53] between the lines Jesus was trying to
[46:57] bring an inherence to them
[46:59] and he was saying to them listen now
[47:04] what you bypass made flesh
[47:09] you should have come this way if you
[47:12] would have come this way you would have
[47:14] done the same thing
[47:16] but I'm here for Redemption purposes
[47:21] because this all belongs to you right
[47:24] that's right listen now
[47:26] we don't know all that Adam had in the
[47:30] beginning
[47:31] we know as Prophet said oh that Adam
[47:36] lost
[47:37] Christ restored right amen
[47:41] and we know that there was a time
[47:43] because Adam was God of the Earth
[47:48] and he can speak the word yeah
[47:52] he could speak
[47:55] and whatever it was it would obey right
[47:57] amen God would bring the animals to him
[48:02] and he would say
[48:06] mom
[48:08] you're you're a lion yeah
[48:13] yeah and
[48:16] that meat creature beside you
[48:20] that's a lamb right
[48:24] because the names is character right
[48:26] right
[48:31] that's the eagle yeah
[48:33] right
[48:36] sure hey who is this that just landed on
[48:39] my shoulder
[48:41] I'm gonna call you the dub amen
[48:46] he had the power to name these things
[48:49] exactly by their nature and even in the
[48:52] Bible that's their characteristics
[48:55] because when you go through the Bible
[48:56] it's lamb lion dragon serpent Dove
[49:02] etc etc etc
[49:06] and God would come down in the evening
[49:08] time not just like some spook right he
[49:11] would come down in a great theophany
[49:13] amen
[49:16] God in his great theophany right and
[49:19] walk through the garden without him all
[49:21] right yes sir
[49:22] Adam even though he lived in this three
[49:26] dimensions that we are bound to Lifetime
[49:30] and matter yet he was not restricted he
[49:34] was not constricted to that right right
[49:36] nope
[49:37] that's what this message is bringing us
[49:39] back to right amen
[49:41] where you will not be held by these
[49:43] dimensionals right right Uptown lighting
[49:47] matter
[49:49] because his brand complete restoration
[49:51] amen and God has showed that in the
[49:53] scriptures
[49:55] you see the prophet talked about that in
[49:57] the message countdown
[49:59] and you and I have been brought on this
[50:01] great countdown for what what has it all
[50:04] been about to bring you to bring your
[50:07] inheritance to you in Satan's even right
[50:10] right absolutely amen and for you to
[50:13] stand with the word that you're living
[50:15] by every day God in Simplicity every day
[50:18] believe in the word confessing the word
[50:21] and moving into that word and sometimes
[50:25] we need the Holy Ghost to kind of put us
[50:27] in the corner you know because we know
[50:30] we'll just you know yeah but sometimes
[50:33] like Queen Esther
[50:35] who thought maybe if she didn't say
[50:38] anything it would preserve her life yeah
[50:41] but Mordecai said don't think you'll be
[50:43] saved Esther right right
[50:46] she began to meditate
[50:48] that I didn't bring myself here to this
[50:51] position right
[50:53] I didn't make myself Queen
[50:56] it was something greater God brought me
[51:00] here for such a time as this
[51:03] thank Lord
[51:05] and sometimes the Holy Ghost right makes
[51:08] us deal with issues right and many times
[51:11] people don't want to deal with issue
[51:13] they want to wait to some some super
[51:15] hold some super duper thing come down
[51:19] what are you waiting on we we have the
[51:22] word to deal with an issue anything in
[51:25] your life don't put in a way to deal
[51:27] with it by the word of God it's called
[51:29] your heritage right that's it
[51:32] this is a living way
[51:35] this is a perfect way right and God's
[51:38] leaving you God's bringing you bringing
[51:41] that inheritance that was preserved in
[51:43] heaven for you right right here
[51:47] animal could travel like us all
[51:50] we can walk on water yeah he was God of
[51:53] the Earth right and
[51:55] he had God's character right yep he had
[51:59] God's word
[52:01] listen Tom broad will have God's
[52:03] likeness exactly
[52:06] to be the very manifestation and that's
[52:09] what you're walking into yeah that's why
[52:11] Peter said
[52:13] elect
[52:15] he belongs to the elective amen it's not
[52:18] anyone else right
[52:20] but to those that had
[52:23] Journal life in God
[52:26] that's why a prophet
[52:28] a prophet can look into the genes right
[52:32] because that's what this message has
[52:34] come down to Oh yeah and when you begin
[52:37] to follow the prophet in this message
[52:38] you'll follow him dawned down until
[52:41] he'll say things like The Germ of your
[52:44] spiritual life was in God right
[52:48] that where you come from your very
[52:51] origin your very new birth
[52:54] was a germ of life right in the
[52:58] chromosome of almighty God amen amen yes
[53:00] sir
[53:02] and when your birth of that Gene of God
[53:05] then what can you do
[53:07] but obey God evacuate
[53:11] he's not going to deny himself right now
[53:14] man and you feed him from your theophany
[53:16] you're not going to deny the very word
[53:19] that God is transforming
[53:22] because he's raising you up yes sir and
[53:25] you're moving into your inheritance all
[53:26] right let's let's just finish reading
[53:29] this here
[53:30] verse verse 3 blessed be the god of our
[53:33] father
[53:35] our Lord Jesus Christ which according to
[53:38] His abundant Mercy has begotten us now
[53:40] that's born again right
[53:42] we've been born again
[53:45] unto a lively hope right yeah look your
[53:49] your mom and daddy
[53:51] didn't make you
[53:53] you didn't right that's right your
[53:55] parents might be Holy Ghost Field right
[53:58] but God don't have any grandchildren
[54:00] right
[54:01] right and we have to come God's provided
[54:04] place of worship that's the only way God
[54:08] bless you bless him that's the only way
[54:11] right
[54:14] even in the in the church
[54:16] we see
[54:18] Isaac a type of Christ
[54:21] a type of the promised son
[54:24] who took the sacrifice
[54:27] who took the wood up to Mount Moriah he
[54:31] was obedient to death right he was a
[54:34] type of Christ right and he married a
[54:37] gentile girl name her and Becca because
[54:40] Rebecca was from Mesopotamia and that
[54:42] was Babylon and that's where you came
[54:45] out of Babylon you see amen
[54:50] and she was the type of a a perfect type
[54:54] of LeBron the only closer type than
[54:57] Rebecca is Ruth in the scripture
[55:02] and for 20 years
[55:04] she was Barren no
[55:08] no two Holy Ghost Field parents yeah
[55:12] and she was Barren and went to Isaac and
[55:15] said I want to have a child and Isaac
[55:18] said am I God
[55:20] am I going to give you a seat
[55:24] but he began to pray also right
[55:28] and after 20 long years
[55:32] when people thought nothing was
[55:34] happening
[55:36] in the womb of this message amen was in
[55:40] time twins
[55:43] 40 years
[55:46] just like Rebecca couldn't bear for 20
[55:48] long years
[55:52] people come to the message and go and
[55:55] come and go yeah up and down in and out
[56:00] yeah but it has affected someone right
[56:04] amen
[56:07] and God came to Rebecca
[56:10] and she said oh God what is this and he
[56:13] said in your womb there are two Nations
[56:16] yeah
[56:17] of people right
[56:21] and when she came and when she brought
[56:24] forth
[56:25] she brought forth Esau
[56:28] but yet Jacob was grabbing at his heel
[56:32] because Jacob wanted the inheritance
[56:37] all right
[56:38] that's right and even his first words in
[56:41] the Bible
[56:43] was give me the inheritance
[56:46] because he was a type of abroad who
[56:49] wants her inheritance in this last day
[56:52] man right
[56:54] right so even though they were Holy
[56:56] Ghost mother Holy Ghost father not like
[56:59] in Genesis
[57:01] where one seed was serpent seat yeah and
[57:06] the other seed was Adam seed all right
[57:10] two fathers same mother yeah
[57:14] and brought for two different right
[57:17] yeah but yet this is two Holy Ghost
[57:20] Field parents right
[57:22] same mother same father and one Esau and
[57:27] one Jacob
[57:28] and that's the same thing this message
[57:31] produces in this time on each other
[57:36] and Jacob he wants the birthright he
[57:41] wants the inheritance
[57:44] and God knows you want that inheritance
[57:48] more than life
[57:51] because for this purpose
[57:53] as Jesus said shall I pray father
[57:56] deliver me from this hour for for this
[58:00] hour came High into the world for this
[58:03] hour God predestinated you for this time
[58:07] amen
[58:11] amen sometimes we have to get past the
[58:13] Clapping out of the hands and pass the
[58:15] singing other songs and ask ourselves
[58:18] what is it all about
[58:24] and we have to get down to this honestly
[58:26] right
[58:28] and if we don't have the baptism Holy
[58:30] Ghost you can have the baptism on the
[58:32] Holy Ghost
[58:33] seek the word of God all right man right
[58:35] Peter said repent and be baptized in the
[58:38] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[58:39] of sin and ye shall receive the promise
[58:42] right you said brother Andre already
[58:44] done it well you just keep walking man
[58:46] and you watch God under your face right
[58:48] right that's why we're seeing this last
[58:50] hour
[58:52] people who have started off in this walk
[58:54] and get to sanctification and say you
[58:57] know everything's fine now
[58:59] continue to walk with the word amen amen
[59:03] continue to press on right and you're
[59:06] going to press on because there's a deep
[59:08] coin to the Deep right right all right
[59:10] and that deep calling to the deepest
[59:12] drawing you that great word
[59:15] representation right
[59:17] it is like an umbilical cord
[59:20] through your born-again experience
[59:22] you're connected to it right right then
[59:24] as brother Branham said your life on
[59:27] Earth is our reflecting what you are in
[59:31] another dimension right right
[59:35] that's right
[59:37] and we're thankful that a prophet you
[59:39] can look into the genes I remember
[59:41] Brother Cleveland and I think I heard
[59:44] brother biscoll
[59:45] and we're talking about there was an
[59:46] Indian tribe I think up in Alaska maybe
[59:49] you Brothers know the story that's right
[59:51] and they were supposed to they wanted to
[59:53] receive some kind of benefits and things
[59:55] from the government
[59:56] but they did not know the genealogy or
[1:00:00] the bloodline of whose father was whose
[1:00:02] father in it great father right and
[1:00:04] brother random went yep
[1:00:06] and he said now this is your great
[1:00:09] grandfather was this man and this was
[1:00:12] your father and this was your great
[1:00:13] great grandfather you're Gregory yeah
[1:00:15] yeah because a prophet could do those
[1:00:18] things
[1:00:19] you believe Paul was a prophet yeah
[1:00:23] oh he could preach the male chances of
[1:00:26] that and look into the genes of Abraham
[1:00:28] and said Levi paid toys when he was in
[1:00:33] the loins of Abraham he could look into
[1:00:35] the genes right and the problem God
[1:00:38] would bring that why would he bring it
[1:00:40] up because it's where you originated
[1:00:42] from and you who have eternal life you
[1:00:46] have representation the gene of your
[1:00:49] spiritual life was in God before the
[1:00:52] foundation of the world exactly right
[1:00:54] brother man can you run that back to
[1:00:55] Genesis 1-1 what the scripture says in
[1:00:57] the beginning out on him and that's as
[1:01:00] far as the Theologian can go to Genesis
[1:01:02] 1 1 and the beginning but we had a
[1:01:05] prophet that could go beyond Genesis 1 1
[1:01:08] into the back part of God's mind and
[1:01:12] bring these things to the end time bro
[1:01:15] amen because they're essential
[1:01:18] how can we hold the child how can we
[1:01:20] hold an abstract deed in our hands and
[1:01:24] not know who father was unless we're
[1:01:27] pedigree right amen see this bro knows
[1:01:32] his mom and poppies
[1:01:36] they know where they originated from
[1:01:39] right
[1:01:40] and God knows them
[1:01:44] that's who you are amen glory by great
[1:01:47] inheritance
[1:01:53] body to it
[1:01:57] in the first rapture
[1:01:59] he came to his inheritance by Walking
[1:02:03] with God right right
[1:02:05] because his walk represented
[1:02:09] reconciliation right right
[1:02:12] and God reconciled Enoch
[1:02:15] to himself
[1:02:17] and you all know we all know this the
[1:02:20] prophet said that in it started walking
[1:02:25] with God
[1:02:28] and he got so close to God's house
[1:02:33] like God said
[1:02:35] just come home just come with me right
[1:02:38] listen now listen now what's the problem
[1:02:41] talking about
[1:02:42] he's not just talking about someone
[1:02:44] going on a walk
[1:02:45] this is a spiritual condition that Enoch
[1:02:50] walked into right
[1:02:52] he walked into a spiritual condition
[1:02:55] that the the characteristic of his life
[1:02:59] became the scripture that God could not
[1:03:02] deny him reality man
[1:03:05] and they wonder what happened to the
[1:03:07] Capstone in that day yeah it disappeared
[1:03:10] yeah but he even had it though right
[1:03:13] in the second Rapture Elijah he knew his
[1:03:17] inheritance
[1:03:19] and the third rapture
[1:03:22] Jesus Christ this was the third Old
[1:03:25] Testament right to Jesus Christ that's
[1:03:27] right
[1:03:29] he knew his inheritance right in the
[1:03:32] father man right
[1:03:34] and the first New Testament Rapture the
[1:03:37] Old Testament Saints they knew their
[1:03:40] inheritance because listen to them in
[1:03:44] Psalms 24 when Jesus is leading
[1:03:47] captivity captive and they cry out open
[1:03:49] up he guides and be lifted up
[1:03:53] for the king of glory is coming in
[1:03:56] how can they say that right how could
[1:03:59] job and those men say that because they
[1:04:02] had come to their inheritance and they
[1:04:05] were in a glorious glorified body in the
[1:04:08] province him right
[1:04:10] open up your Gates and be lifted up and
[1:04:13] let the king of glory come in who is
[1:04:15] this king of glory all right
[1:04:20] all right right here's the king of glory
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:25] the second New Testament right
[1:04:27] about you amen
[1:04:31] an inheritance right
[1:04:34] that cannot be corrupted that will not
[1:04:38] fade away
[1:04:40] that was reserved in heaven for you
[1:04:44] right because you had citizenship now
[1:04:49] the hemoglobin the life doesn't come
[1:04:52] from the woman that's right that's from
[1:04:55] the man
[1:04:56] that's why you had citizenship right in
[1:05:00] glory before you ever came to the Earth
[1:05:04] because the germ of your spiritual life
[1:05:06] right
[1:05:07] it was in Christ
[1:05:09] I said Christ right right
[1:05:12] what's your germ
[1:05:14] and when you were born again
[1:05:17] that germ just like your natural germ of
[1:05:21] life
[1:05:23] opened up right yep
[1:05:25] The Germ of your spiritual life that God
[1:05:28] has desired to see come forth for God to
[1:05:31] see someone and Trust

[1:11:09] we know our position Amen in the Book of
[1:11:13] Numbers when God numbered them and
[1:11:15] established them trials in tribal order
[1:11:18] right it was for one purpose that he
[1:11:21] would dwell in the midst of them but
[1:11:23] each one of those trials were
[1:11:24] represented under an anointing right
[1:11:27] right and they knew the anointing that
[1:11:30] they were represented under right
[1:11:33] right and if you went to Dan it would
[1:11:34] say we're Dan we're represented by the
[1:11:37] eagle from the north right
[1:11:40] they knew their inheritance
[1:11:43] and we know our inheritance
[1:11:46] we know
[1:11:48] Papa John yes sir and this is how
[1:11:51] Philippians 2 our sin our citizenship is
[1:11:54] in heaven from which also we look for
[1:11:57] the Savior Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:02] change
[1:12:03] our
[1:12:05] vile amen body that it may be fashion
[1:12:09] like unto his glorious body according to
[1:12:13] the working whereby he is able even just
[1:12:16] to do all things unto himself all right
[1:12:19] right right
[1:12:22] remember when brother round wouldn't be
[1:12:24] on the current of time all right
[1:12:26] and he said his horse came right
[1:12:30] a horse
[1:12:33] yep and his dog came
[1:12:37] and somebody said bro they wrote Melissa
[1:12:39] we thought there's more spirits of that
[1:12:40] horses in him
[1:12:43] so well you know
[1:12:45] about this in Revelation 19. yeah I
[1:12:49] think Christ's return on horse on a
[1:12:51] white horse and the armies of Heaven
[1:12:53] followed him yeah
[1:12:57] but just look for a moment his horse
[1:13:02] and a voice would say to him all that
[1:13:06] you ever loved right
[1:13:09] and all that ever loved you right
[1:13:14] God has given you right
[1:13:16] what an inheritance
[1:13:20] what an inheritance that God would
[1:13:22] permit us to learn about a woman named
[1:13:25] Hattie Wright right
[1:13:28] yep
[1:13:29] you don't have to have brother Brown and
[1:13:31] lay hands on you and pray for you you
[1:13:34] have an inheritance
[1:13:37] if you're faking believe it you have an
[1:13:40] inheritance
[1:13:42] you haven't lost loved ones you have an
[1:13:45] inheritance
[1:13:49] you have a dream in here it's my brother
[1:13:51] and sister that's right
[1:13:53] but God
[1:13:54] has in store and is revealing to those
[1:13:58] but he loves and that loves him right
[1:14:01] this last day Brian
[1:14:03] this in time rod
[1:14:06] this beautiful
[1:14:09] this lovely Ruth
[1:14:12] standing in this hour clear-cut decision
[1:14:16] steadfastly minded moving into
[1:14:19] inheritance the very field that Ruth
[1:14:23] would glean in she never knew
[1:14:25] one day she would own the field right
[1:14:28] the very feel that she gleaned she would
[1:14:31] own the field
[1:14:33] Rahab
[1:14:34] the life that she lived and yet
[1:14:38] it was put in the sea of God's
[1:14:40] forgiveness that's right and what an
[1:14:43] inheritance that he gave her because
[1:14:45] after she married Solomon
[1:14:48] she had a son named uh Obed and I
[1:14:52] believe that's right you see yeah and on
[1:14:55] and on and on Tamar
[1:14:59] she wanted an inheritance and judah's
[1:15:01] son could not do that
[1:15:03] he died and then Judah told his other
[1:15:07] son you go in with her he refused to do
[1:15:10] it
[1:15:11] she played the part of the heart and why
[1:15:14] she wanted to have seed and she wanted
[1:15:17] to be a part of the lineage of Judah
[1:15:19] yeah
[1:15:21] and God bless Tamar
[1:15:23] and gave her a son named Forest
[1:15:26] Now read the line all the way down all
[1:15:29] of these Gentile women
[1:15:31] zakoria Moses wife asanal Joseph's wife
[1:15:35] right yeah yep they all fell into
[1:15:37] inheritance and we've come in this last
[1:15:40] day an inheritance that God has brought
[1:15:43] back to us that belongs to us my brother
[1:15:45] and sister that's right brother you have
[1:15:46] to go you have to State you have to
[1:15:49] State claims right on your inheritance
[1:15:51] right exactly stake those claims on your
[1:15:54] inheritance right they belong to you
[1:15:57] they're yours that's right they don't
[1:16:00] belong to anyone else
[1:16:03] amen this last quote here in the message
[1:16:06] God of this evil age brother Brown says
[1:16:08] now for God of this evil age page 15
[1:16:11] paragraph 68 for as The Germ of for as
[1:16:15] The Germ of natural life
[1:16:17] is brought down
[1:16:20] germanized from father to father to
[1:16:24] father so is the Life of Christ
[1:16:28] germatized that's the reason God uses
[1:16:33] Elijah's Spirit five different times
[1:16:36] what is it it's the handy down right
[1:16:40] right
[1:16:42] it's handed down inheritance amen
[1:16:45] because it's germatized from one seed
[1:16:47] from one seed from one father to the
[1:16:49] father to the father to the father
[1:16:52] and the message of Malachi 4 was to
[1:16:56] bring this germ through the son of man
[1:16:59] Minister and Christ bringing germ life
[1:17:02] lamb life God's word Zoey life all right
[1:17:07] Laurie
[1:17:10] it says now
[1:17:12] just as just as
[1:17:14] your natural life
[1:17:16] and traits
[1:17:18] is handed down from the natural breeding
[1:17:21] of your father so is the spirit of God
[1:17:25] that was predestinated before the
[1:17:28] foundation of the world all right and
[1:17:30] when the entire word of God
[1:17:32] incomplete was headed up in a human body
[1:17:35] called Jesus Christ and there God made
[1:17:39] me pay for my sins in him there then he
[1:17:42] rose me raised me up with him in the
[1:17:46] resurrection and now we are seated with
[1:17:49] him with power and authority over every
[1:17:53] devil oh if you could only believe what
[1:17:57] God has given
[1:17:58] but if you're not seated there right you
[1:18:01] don't have it all right and if you're
[1:18:03] seated there but you don't believe it or
[1:18:05] afraid to move you'll never use it right
[1:18:08] but if you're seated there you will use
[1:18:11] it all right for your ordained to do
[1:18:13] what you do God bless you let me just
[1:18:16] read this one more quote God bless you
[1:18:18] this is the last one here and a message
[1:18:19] adoption part four all right brother
[1:18:21] Brown says now look
[1:18:23] he has predestinated us into this
[1:18:26] inheritance if I am a right inheritance
[1:18:30] of something if God is knocking at my
[1:18:33] heart saying William Brown I called you
[1:18:36] a long time ago before the foundation of
[1:18:38] the world to preach the gospel I have an
[1:18:42] inheritance an inheritance of eternal
[1:18:45] life now God sent Jesus to make that
[1:18:48] inheritance real to me right because
[1:18:51] there was nothing I could do to inherit
[1:18:54] it it was blank it was valid there was
[1:18:57] nothing I could do but in the fullness
[1:19:00] of time God sent his own good in his own
[1:19:03] good time Jesus the lamb slain from the
[1:19:07] foundation of the world his blood was
[1:19:09] shed that I might go to my inheritance
[1:19:12] Amen to be what what inheritance the
[1:19:15] sonship to be a Son of God and now this
[1:19:19] may just choke you to death but did you
[1:19:21] know that men that are sons of God are
[1:19:24] amateur Gods how many ever know that how
[1:19:28] many know that Jesus said saw the Bible
[1:19:30] Jesus said did not your law say itself
[1:19:34] that ye are gods and if you called him
[1:19:37] God why God said in Genesis 2 that they
[1:19:41] were God because they were they had full
[1:19:44] dominion over the Dominion of the world
[1:19:47] he gave him dominion over all things and
[1:19:51] he lost his sonship he lost his sonship
[1:19:54] he lost his domain and Satan took it
[1:19:57] over but brother
[1:19:59] we are waiting for the manifestation of
[1:20:02] the sons of God finally amen
[1:20:06] let me say it this way

[1:20:24] the sons of God
[1:20:26] who will come back and take it over
[1:20:29] again right waiting for the fullness of
[1:20:32] that time when the pyramid gets to the
[1:20:34] top when the full sons of God will be
[1:20:36] manifested with power of God will walk
[1:20:38] out Hallelujah and will take every Power
[1:20:41] of saints God away from him yes sir it
[1:20:44] belongs to him do you all believe that
[1:20:47] amen right yeah let me show you what I'm
[1:20:49] reading in case you don't believe it
[1:20:50] that's your thoughts all right that's a
[1:20:53] great thing I'm saying it's a great
[1:20:55] thing right amen amen that's somebody
[1:20:59] this brought these Believers that sit
[1:21:03] here tonight
[1:21:05] this preaching a brother Dale's been
[1:21:08] preaching over the year that the Harvest
[1:21:11] of this preaching man right exactly well
[1:21:13] and when the rest don't listen now when
[1:21:16] the rest of the churches don't know what
[1:21:18] to do because the members are living all
[1:21:21] kind of lives living in adulterous
[1:21:23] fornication unclean yet there would be
[1:21:27] churches that will be burnt giving birth
[1:21:30] the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:21:32] and when we got all this nonsense around
[1:21:35] the message going on we should be giving
[1:21:37] birth to sons and days of God when we
[1:21:40] got all this massive nonsense don't
[1:21:41] worry about that right that was
[1:21:43] prophesied to me it will be right that's
[1:21:45] none of your business all right this is
[1:21:47] your business amen
[1:21:56] the Holy Ghost will push you there right
[1:21:59] that's it because you've been born again

[1:22:04] right we gonna put you there right
[1:22:07] you're gonna see it hey man and you're
[1:22:09] gonna say thank you Lord that's right he
[1:22:12] says now he's the logos that
[1:22:16] that was the son of God then he made man
[1:22:19] a little God and he said if they call
[1:22:22] those who the word of God came through
[1:22:24] prophets if they call them God to the
[1:22:26] word of God come to and God said so
[1:22:29] himself that they are Gods he told Moses
[1:22:32] I will make you God and make air in your
[1:22:34] make Aaron your Prophet brother Ben says
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:37] he says I may act like a religious crank
[1:22:40] but I'm not oh when your eyes can come
[1:22:44] open and see those things all right he
[1:22:48] made man of God a God in his domain and
[1:22:52] his domain goes from sea to Sea from
[1:22:54] Shore to Shore he has control of it and
[1:22:56] when Jesus came being the one God
[1:22:58] without sin he proved it
[1:23:00] when the winds blowed he said peace be
[1:23:03] still amen all right and when the trees
[1:23:04] he said no man eat from thee there I say
[1:23:07] unto you that you little Gods if you say
[1:23:10] to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:23:12] doubt in your heart but believe what you
[1:23:14] say all right it will come to pass amen
[1:23:17] exactly think of that when he said that
[1:23:20] those men looked at him and said what
[1:23:22] kind of man just by speaking a word can
[1:23:25] move a mountain this man must be guilty
[1:23:28] amen amen
[1:23:30] that man was deity and that man
[1:23:34] and I believe that and you believe that
[1:23:38] hitting the Lord good to him
