like turn in your scriptures we'll byass uh Isaiah and go right on into our scriptures so we'll be reading from Romans 11 and Ephesians 4 but remember now we read read a couple of services from Isaiah and that is your Masterpiece family and that's what we're still speaking about is on that remember the announcements that are made remember the the banquet coming up this weekend this Saturday and so remember those things uh brother uh Vernon from the Philippines will be with us sometime in March now there's not a set uh he's coming in to uh brother uh Bisal and him and then somewhere after the 14th or there about he's going to head more south so the Lord willing he'll be with us but that's just a kind of a ten for right now and all he can be given us a lot of good reports about what's going on over there you know cuz he is in charge of the handling him and some of the brothers of the rebuilding a lot of the places and the things and the first concern was food and uh then shelters and then uh clothing and things you know and now they're beginning to work a little bit into uh getting some Churches rebuilt in the different things because they they had to go along to the schedule but just remember that and just pray that the Lord would bless Romans 11 and Ephesians 4 Heavenly Father we thank you for the hour that we have because you have given it unto us and in that you've given us a word a Time that we could receive and Lord that we could follow after you and to know the hour that we're living to recognize our our day and its message the time and what we're to be making manifest we pray that you would just come on the scene now and honor your word as we read it and you'd reach down and touch the sick among us because you promised it and we believe you and just have your way now we love you and we thank you guide us now and forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in your love in Jesus name amen Romans 11 in verse 25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this this mystery lest you should be lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness and part has happened to Israel unto fullness of the Gentiles be in and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out as Z to deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as con touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake why after all of the ways and thinking about the Jews and what's happened and the the uh the parts that's been there you know and how they've been and all and uh to think that God would sum it up here by Paul saying for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance and that would truly be right right that it wouldn't be something that we could do or whatever it' be without repentance Ephesians 4:7 but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that as ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the the body of Christ till we now that's a state a place when you would come forth and say something's going to happen and then you'll say till we come it's stating that it's going to happen amen a set time you know it's going to happen till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature or the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every when of Doctrine but by the slight of of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ For Whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that whichever joint suppli and once that because every place is me and every gift is important all right according to the effectual work in the measure of every part making maketh interess make excuse me increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now try not to back up too far but recap just a little bit of this morning and then you know try to come down to the to the point that of what we're saying of the gifts and callings of God now the prophet said we don't you don't repent to get a gift it's not something like that it's not something that you don't have and then you can go do something you know in joining a church become a Christian Etc uh and then you get a gift see that's like passing out things so we don't believe in passing out gifts and even though it sounds like it as we gave this morning in Paul that you know from the laying on the hands and things but that's really to stir up the gift you know in the person it stir it's it puts it into motion to bring it into a place to where that it can be used of God because what we want to do is see even though our gift the gift is there when you're lost and uh you know you could do this that the other different things in there but when you become a Christian you want everything to turn towards God and and you know doing for him so then I you know whatever you would have as ability to speak well then see you want that turned over into uh the the gospel of the word to be able to express it and and help the people to understand you know and and that would be good because that would be your gift and it wouldn't be then something that you could go to school to learn because you know like we were in a meeting one time and and this brother he was saying you know you do this and you do that and you do this and you brother dick punched me and he said he he's been trained ain't he get everybody involved and all well then when I got up behind him and spoke he come to me later and he said I went to school a long time he said but you got it natural and see well that was the way it was supposed to be a gift is supposed to be something natural not something you work up but something you're born with into where you can can and be able to help people with it all right now we've talked about and for months and months and months been on predestination that the prophet says 154 Church age book that it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God but it's the word or seed all right then coming into the gifts and callings of God calling of God and and saying that you know there are there and and God is ordained it to be then we're not trying to uh be anything ourselves we're trying as I said a moment ago to yield ourselves and let that gift work in our lives for his benefit because why because the gift is him anyway it's not you and I uh even a gift of playing a guitar or or piano or whatever you know a real gift not the trained things and all the but the real gift I is an ability just to relax a little bit and everything flows you know and it ain't like me with 14 thumbs you know and that's why I tell you I don't do no text messages and stuff cuz my fingers are too big to to get on and you know the telephone ain't big enough I need one about this big you know but see if you got a gift then use the gift we believe in gifts I believe in them here I I've never set anybody down for speaking in tongues even in the congregation let it go and see and then we will put it in order by the prophet and then it'll work out you know and we don't have any problems with it cuz that's uh I won't have to answer for the fact of of regulating orever what you call it controls on you uh because you're the one that's doing that in yourself but we we believe in all of the gifts but we're trying to see that all gifts come from God Amen right what would be coming from the devil we don't want that anyway and and no matter what that he would even work because the Bible and the prophet says there's only two powers and that's God's power and Satan don't have any but he said it's what God permits him to have so it's not a power it's not everything you know and and he's got as I said this morning the scripture says that he has uh angels that are ministering spirits and preachers in other words to to go forth and do things but watch them they'll always preach era right they may go a long while but just keep following it you'll finally see it drop off and it it'll produce what it is because they can't follow into God if it's a true gift of God it's going to honor God all right so whatever God you get your gift from you're going to honor that God all right and and and in doing it but now now then it's the word or person that comes predestinated eternally you know not the word of not the person but the word of word that becomes predestinated Eternal and the for knowledge lets God know where that's going to drop who it's going to be in and and that'll work in his for knowledge but then we went through this morning talking about Jesus Christ God himself that that's not uh he's not a uh a gift he's the person it's not a gift of God and the Bas is when it says the the the gift of God is eternal life that's not a gift of God like a gift that God has and he passes them out and you know this and he does that and does that it's himself coming and living in you and I to give us eternal life it's his own life it's not our lives and we should be very careful about what we do with them with the gifts and the things like that you know to keep it because we want to make sure to be right see Jesus then as I said this morning come predestinated eternally all right he didn't have to be a for knowledge forn knowledge sure he understood and he knew what would take place but it was already in his plan and purpose before he started thinking about what the Earth would be like in what would take place if you want to call it that way he already was a a part of God because he was God all right then if it's a true gift that we have then that true gift is a part of God now we're going to get on over into a little bit of doing it but do you understand what I'm saying the difference between Jesus and you and I is the fact that he was predestinated eternally all right now and I'm talking about Jesus Christ see because you come all the way through the Old Testament with the Christ coming out into Jesus and Jesus Christ all right but see you and I is predestinated about forn knowledge about the person you're looking at but the gift of God is predestinated eternally amen all right now that's where we have to decide because that's where that uh you know I was looking and I I didn't bring a lot of them because that it would reflect and people would think think you're trying to boost yourself up or something I didn't write the book I didn't write the Bible I didn't preach the prophet's message but I can read you know what he says about honoring the gifts and God will honor you and all like that that's that's the doing and that's all I've ever asked you to do is not to honor me as the flesh because I've got all I take have need of you know I don't have to worry about it and all but I want you to honor the gift because that way the gift can help you and you should do that in any Minister and not look at the person because you can look at the person and fail you know uh you can see things you don't want to see uh doing it but it's like brother Brandon said Isaiah he said there he was of that great things of being like he was to speak but said he was an ordinary person the Bible says about Elijah you know he's a man of like passion in other words a being right but now do you understand the difference between God and a prophet God is the prophet that's who he is he is the son of man he's the Lord Jesus Christ he's God himself all right and that's more important than anything else and the reason it's called a gift is because it's given right now if the gift if the Bible's right it says the gift of God is eternal life then that means that there was a time you didn't have it right amen well why does everybody want to deal with you know always was and all like that without understanding right the eternal life of God always was eternal amen all right so then that would put your gift in the eternity back together in the form of the word the word as we were saying this morning the prophets were predestinated right that's wonderful because they were bringing the word right one Prophet would speak of something like there was one there and I maybe right on it close yeah uh where it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever right about where we ended up and he's talking about nobody had to do in other words they didn't have nothing to do with God made him a prophet before he was born talking about Moses to fulfill Abraham promise so each one was promising the next to come the next to come to build the body of Christ that would come forth and and be the the correct things and and that way you wouldn't have a high parts and leave off this or leave that you would be lined up in the correct order all right now works as Faith Express he says there was no question why the ground in his heart was a predestinated person gifts and callings are repentance God had told Abraham he would do that and there was the ground prepared so Moses could just lean back and depend upon God and let God do it and he waited upon God and that's that's one of the things it's hard for people to comprehend the things that brother brandham would say because God choose Moses out one day for not just speaking and going to H did but yet he wasn't chewing him out cu he wasn't waiting on him he was chewing him out because he didn't you know he said why cist speak in other words I've ordained you I've given you all that's been done you've let them out this so far speak it and go on Amen don't wait around to do just get up and go on all right because even brother randam when he'd come down to speaking the word remember that speaking the word of the five times we talk about you know a different he said it was sovereignly given that's right so we don't go out and speak our own words I've got one in here somewhere word the brother around said only a prophet has a right to say thus sayith the Lord because a prophet then is speaking as God's mouthpiece see when you say thus sayith the Lord that means somebody else is speaking through you all right but the court trial as we were on this morning says all prophets are predestinated all right gifts and callings without repentance Jeremiah you know God goes through those things he said the gifts and callings aren't laying hands on one another it's what God does it's what God does it's not you and I can pass them out it's what God does all right those prophets would pick up the thought of God as Moses and then he would bring it in it becomes Moses thought that's how close it is to the man but yet then he would speak and it would become a word but when Moses would his brother BR said when he stepped forward to speak he was God to the people but when he steps back he's Moses but now Jesus wasn't God to the people and stepped back and was a man he was the man Christ Jesus all right see the prophet then would be in a a different form but yet being used watch what he says on perseverance but my gift comes from God because I love him and this I believe gifts and callings are without repentance they're predestinated of God they're each generation and my part in this was to be was to that word for it to live again because the word to discern and know that's Pro prophetic which is Promised according to Malachi 4 to be in this day makes us perfectly in the last day all right see then the word coming to Isaiah to bring the word itself was God the gift was God the man was human brother brandham said he was one that was standing by that was being used see go you go too far you go into deity right so you leave it the way it is the human body of brother brandham was not deity God but the God that was in him in the New Birth was deity the god that's in You by the new birth is deity all right so then put that together with it and just remember then the gift the gift is what makes him greater than anyone else other than than regular things he's a normal person right right as I said a moment ago about Elijah or which one it says was a man of like passion in other words he was a person a human being just like anybody else he wasn't something special but yet the gift in his life made something very special because that was God using his Prophet all right that's what it's supposed to be then all right look what he says on do God change his mind 65 he said I am not he but I am his servant I do not believe that you lay hands on people and give them gifts gifts and callings are without repentance they are predestinated of God to meet the age and the time of that age right any Bible student knows that's the truth Moses was born just in time Jeremiah in time all the rest of them John the Baptist in time Jesus was in time and we're in time see all right so then keep the person separated from the Eternal Word that they're to bring that's right and that way we keep our all ourselves in line now one day when we leave out of here right okay when we leave out of here and go into eternity then we won't be dealing with having to you know when we're changed and made Eternal then you you can bring the whole person back together and bring it but we've got to keep it separated until that time comes because if not we're going into a deity form that you know would would make those things he said I am not the son of man he's the son of man right all right because he was the word but yet he was the part of the word for that age on the fifth seal he says talking about gifts and callings are predestinated of God they are they are God's gifts and callings even without repentance the Bible says he goes on down in a little bit and explains he said you mean before you was born he said yes the gift was there before you know born again the gift was di before I was born again all right then see we're we're dealing with something that that we're trying to separate from what we're looking at the natural Earthly thing and see what God is using mankind to do he's working through through mankind on the early Christian experience in 52 he says it's not in gifts and callings and things them things are that was made up back y before the world begun I can't get out of his predestinated will I want you I can't get out of his predestinated will he's already willed me what to do all right but it's just something I would like to do along another line in other words he said I just love to to help souls and not deal with gifts is what he goes on to explain but the understand what I'm trying to get to look at the next one lean not to your understanding it's like I said a gift is not something that's like you take a knife and if you want to cut this this with it you can cut it or you cut this you can cut it but list you see it's not you you but it's whatever you want see that's what we think a gift are you reading it's whatever we think whatever we whatever we want what we want to do with it we think that's a gift well I just go out and speak the word no you can speak presumptuously the Bible says right you might hit or miss but it's not that way but watch what he says that's not a gift of God that's you see it that's not a gift of God no it doesn't work that way a gift of God is some way you have of getting yourself out of the way all it's something you can do and you don't even have to repent to get that started it doesn't work that way right you can be chosen before the world and and the gift and everything already be working in your life before you become a Christian Christian that just activates it trying to say well to go towards God and allows him to use that part of you to where that he can can do it when I sat down to study for a message and you know I said Lord now you use me to express yourself to the people you know and and it's it's hard to explain uh gifts because of people that maybe it doesn't deal with them in that line but I try to make it as simple as I can you have a gift to play a piano you have a gift to sing you have a gift to uh uh clean houses you have a gift for this a gift for that and some people just can't do those things those are gifts all right think about all of the gifts of God that are given to us that God gave us that all then just trying to bring it on down and then we just start separating a little bit as to where uh you know it doesn't all flow together and we let God do it working in the body of Christ if there is nine spiritual gifts in the body all right then God wants to use those we read this morning where it was a sa Spirit you know working in each one it's God doing it all right but see then we just bring it along and just what I'm trying to do this afternoon is just separate just a little bit where that you'll see what my point is my point is that there's gifts and there's gifts there's gifts that is God himself working a gift through the promise in the word then there's gifts that is Promised in the word but promised to everybody you know anybody in the body of Christ is subject to a gift right amen all right Y and if we keep that in our mind it would help us to understand but then getting the point is what God does those prophets standing there until they would actually say like David singing in the spirit as sorry as a rascal as he was but yet he could enter the spirit of God and he would sing they pierce my hands and my feet you know the the the thing he would enter and actually speak in the first person right all right the first person was God right even balam right as bad as he was but the gift that was in him would speak as in the first person and is he would be put in the word as writing but yet him be false himself all right so then that way you separate the man from the gift we honor the gift without honoring the man too far but if we don't honor the man to a certain degree now we've gone wrong cuz we do honor it to a certain degree I I'm not don't do it church kids or whatever you you see somebody in church and they're shouting they're crying or speaking or the preachers a certain way don't make no Li about that don't do that now because that could be the spirit of God see and you you don't want to get in trouble with God about something you know just just let it go and say I just don't agree with that you know I mean you know when I when you ask me said what do you think about that brother so and so I said well I didn't agree with what he said but I'm not picking on him that's between him and God that's that that's that's not to me I'm not the judge we'll get to that in a minute where that there's gifts in the body you know the gifts in the body have to be judged right but you know prophets don't have to be judged there is no way to judge a prophet well we're going to get into 5old Ministry in a minute and I want you to show me how you can judge a five full ministry Ain but one way you can judge any man like that Prophet or fivefold minister is what he does with the word you can't judge anything else you judge him by what he does with the word or how that it fits the rest of the word now Prophet comes out and preaches presumptuously or he gives you a sign and it comes to P etc etc but he takes you to another God what do you do you get away from him all right so the same thing about a your pastor he's ordained to lead you through if he's ordained that's the only problem right you know I'm not not trying to expose anybody of any thoughts but I'm trying to expose the whole thing of to where that we can look at the word and see that we say but that brother that's his way of seeing it well the Bible's not made in the basis of his way of seeing it it's either God or it's not whether it be you me or who it is is you know so you know don't watch the actions of the person as much as you do what he does with the word now come on we're human I mean I go up here and preach to you like every and I go out and commit adultery and this that that's garbage can don't even think about it forget it that's right that proves I'm not a born again Christian let alone a preacher that's right see because we show our own sales all right but now all right do you understand now God himself is a gift the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Jesus Christ himself I'm using Jesus Christ as being almighty God now not just the flesh but the whole thing he was predestinated eternally from God all right and that word that God brings you remember a message we were trying to bring the other day about uh you know where Jesus said he said my words are spirit and they're life now to us we read it it's natural words right right I mean we read it it's natural words until it's revealed off the pages into our heart then when it is we see it like he saw it right then it becomes alive it's something to to do it but to get in now and think about then then the prophets of God being predestinated I'm sure God knew what age they would live in but he knew more than anything the word they would bring right all right he told Jeremiah I saw thee ordained thee before the world for knowledge come on if he's standing here and I say to to Sister M I've seen you downstairs while ago you know that means she's had to be downstairs while ago so that means the four knowledge is got to be working right so you see then the Bible is very simple if we get simple with it but we try to figure it out but now see then a prophet he's not judged I've got it in here somewhere but he's not judged you you don't judge him except for one thing if he says it it comes to pass you you you better believe it if he says it it don't come to P he's automatically judged himself right cuz he's off the word but see then that way he don't have to speak and go ask somebody else it okay for him to say that that's right or be judged whereas we get in a minute gifts when gifts operate then they have to be judged before they come before the congregation right all right and then see in doing that then it makes a distinction of a gift now we're going to get into it in a little bit in the fivefold ministry where brother Randon will be referring to church gifts and he will be referring to offices right the offices are different than Church gifts all right offices can be predestinated eternally prophets are God's mouthpiece the word they bring is predestinated eternally so they're in an office by themselves that's right the FF Ministry coming into the New Testament is not dealing as an Old Testament form it's dealing in a doings because that's why to brother brandham in other words why couldn't brother brandham do as he desired to do he's Old Testament prophet he could do it he could go into the Wilderness he could live with Elijah he could walk out when he wanted to walk out he could give thus sayth the Lord and go back in the wilderness and brother Rand wanted to do that right but yet God said you can't do it why why couldn't he do as that Prophet back there you ever thought of that why why couldn't he why couldn't brother brandham just go and come out you know then go back he wanted to do that he was showed you remember a big garbage burning pile and he said that's where you w that's the way you wind up why was it that he couldn't do that you don't think like that why I've got questions you know I like answers but see he is was in the family of God right the Old Testament prophets were not in the same family of God even John the greatest of all to introduce the head himself Christ he was not in the family of God as we quote it see then he could go to the Wilderness and come out but brother Brandon would have to be a prophet above the five-fold ministry you would agree right agabus was Paul was right he can refer to the church as Messengers as being prophets right I don't have no trouble with that I know we we had meetings and people uh he Paul ain't no Prophet I said well he ain't much Prophet to you and way it goes but you know he said I magnify my own office so if you want to call an apostle then he he magnified his own office what was he brother randam calls those Messengers Luther and them prophets that's fine that's right why because they were the The Messengers to the age the word came it doesn't matter what all the other things Luther taught but yet he taught the just shall live by faith that was the word for the hour that he was living amen right and that brought him to be in that prophetic realm one of those stars in the book of Revelation see in his hands and look how close the star would be to him in his hands you all right but do you understand what I'm saying yes then when you move up into the five-fold ministry remember you're bringing it into dealing with the body of Jesus Christ so brother brandham was a member of the body of Christ by having the new birth amen right all right now and being a member of the body of Christ see then he would be he could fulfill any of the offices right cuz he was above that right amen he was the prophet of the age that the word was to come to right now the word wasn't to come to the fivefold ministry listen to what I'm saying now you say yes it did no I'll get it off of you you're trying to make something the word comes to the prophet right it had already come to the prophet if you want to say it was already written for brother randam guy here go ahead that come through somebody right Paul is the biggest one that the writing of the New Testament comes through right John going to patmas and all and his writings covers up the biggest portion of the the New Testament all right but you see the prophets you you're you're doing we'll get to the next message where you build on the foundation Apostles and Prophets right all right now but stay with me on this of what we're thinking about the prophet being a born again believer in the body of Christ then he couldn't back up away from the people he said you can't do that that's right amen see and the reason is cuz he's in the body of Christ right he would be backing up and and going which that's what he would like to done but he couldn't do it no right see he's part of the body of Christ then when he says the bride is the fullness of the godhead bodily you know what he's part of the Bride when he says a bride will do this and a bride will do that you know what he's part of the Bride right you're not dealing with an Old Testament Prophet that's right come on now that's taught in the message that he was an Old Testament prophet in a new testament age now that's a Doctrine in the message people not too far from here okay that he was an Old Testament prophet in a new testament age I said you'd have a lawgiver if he's an old testament Prophet he'd be a lawgiver that's right you know you can't do that you can't put your messenger in another age that's where they Justified Christmas trees you know how they done that brother brandom was a prophet back there we're in another age so we don't put up Christmas trees even though the prophet put up one well go ahead and do what you want to forget it you are anyway but just to show up the smartness of what mankind thinks he is but listen being a member of the body of Christ put him in the position that he could not isolate himself and just run in and out he has to live with it cuz now here swallow real good okay everybody swallowed okay cuz you see when you get into the New Testament you're getting a little closer to God in human flesh than you are in the Old Testament I said a little closer I got a message on that okay it was coming just just buar with me you you you know if you listen to Masterpiece you know what I'm talking about Mary was not the seed she was a carrier all right somebody's got to be the seed okay when he says that the godhead can't be complete without you amen I believe it couldn't be complete without brother brandham see that's why that when he was speaking one day one of the brothers are something I forgot why it turned out but he said you've been given more gifts than any any of the other prophet in the things the reason was because he was a new testament Born Again believer Paul was in that position for his day but listen Paul was in no comparison and that's not Tor off on Paul he's in glory screaming Hallelujah tell them about it Paul was in no position to qualify for an end time messenger that was to be brought to speak about Malachi 4 right do you see where I give all the honor and the glory to to the man that brought the message unto us all right but then believing it we've got to become that message all right see just just stay with me until I get some things out of the way you know of preaching and then maybe one of these days I'll preach what I believe okay uh then you can get up and leave and say I don't agree with you that's all right but listen what about this five-fold ministry now now if you notice in Ephesians 4 that we read it's got some words in there that are very touching to me because it says he gave he gave now how did the prophet explain that the way that Jesus and God was one you remember that he said God came down and went in him he said that was the way that Jesus and God was one God came down and went in him all right see not a second person or third person or anything he was that person all right now then in thinking about it that he gave some and brother Brandon will'll use we'll get it in a second he said he set in the church now I've given all the honor I think and in my lifetime to believing that and showing you and trying to my best to show you that brother brandham had the message all right and we didn't get it without him the word didn't come to Samuel Dale nor nor better stop that anybody else the word come to the prophet then the word comes to the bride by way of the Prophet but it's got to come through the channel that he said it which is the fful ministry well brother D I can get it for myself you didn't get it for yourself so blab all you want to you never got it I know it for the prophet we needed to follow you all right well don't make us hard now why not get into silliness our total dependence is upon on whether God sent his Prophet or not our total dependence of rapture future whatever it depended upon whether or not that he would keep his word and bring Malachi forward into being and send the word to a man that made him just a little closer than an Old Testament Prophet right I want you to just calculate that a little we'll get back on it because the Old Testament Prophet didn't have the new birth in his soul he could only be anointed right but a new testament Prophet had the new birth well then you better be dealing with a five-fold Ministry in that realm because get the point the prophets of old brought the body Jesus Christ stepped up and there he was right we'll get to it later in another message the New Testament brings the body and then the last one to introduce that was the Elijah of melachi 4 to introduce the word which is Christ but somebody's got to become that word not just talk about it not just be a marry as a carrier we've got to be it all right but follow it now so let's let's just think a little bit Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever 1958 he's talking about prophets and missionaries and Gifts of the church and all first apostles then prophets teachers pastors evangelists uh you know coming down and he gets to it he said Apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers five spiritual gifts that's predestinated now watch so watch what he does he covers he gets it so perfectly uh I sit sometimes and I just I weep keep I everything else just thinking how perfect a man could talk with a seventh grade education and just how perfect a man could speak when there be no other way you could say it cuz look what he's saying you reading it five spiritual gifts that's predestinated that by for knowledge God said in the church now you got the predestinated of the word that says there will be Apostles prophets and things that's the word and then you got what by forn knowledge he brings an individual who can let that gift be within them to speak back so he sets it in there right he sets in the church God did that's exactly right gifts and callings are without repentance all those gifts are in the church I'm not a preacher look at him not much of one I'm just a SP Tire said brother Veil is the preacher now look at it he didn't have no problem with being sincere did he but look at the next one here you himym uh 1958 speak the word Lord if that would be sufficient but God's good he has set in the church gifts first apostles or missionaries both the same Apostles means one cent missionary means one cent Apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors they're all predestinated gifts of God gifts and callings of God are without repentance they're placed in the church to bring the church together hold it together for the glory of God so this part you're looking at is for knowledge right but yet the gift that God has for the church is a predestinated word right through the gift Paul said the gift whereof I'm called right he he he knew that God was using him and he knew God was that it was God speaking through him right and he was trying to help people to see that's where people are saying today well now we're kind of like Baptist you know Baptist they'll take they'll take um pastors and they'll take missionaries which they don't understand that word Apostle missionary but they'll claim missionaries and and they will uh they will take evangelists and on a rare occasion they'll accept except a teacher you know in the form of what they're doing you didn't come through there so you you wouldn't know it but if you'll think about where you came from that was the bases there too because if if somebody come along this is Apostle so and so is going to come and speak for us tonight who do he think he is he's a missionary oh brother I forgot I should have said missionary's coming tonight speak yeah missionary's coming but see we want to try to make ourselves so super spiritual until we can correct the word of God but what I love about it here and I know I have my own definition here and some people may not agree with you may not that's all right but he said he gave some Apostles he gave some prophets he gave some teachers he gave some evangelists and pastors I've made my definition of that understanding to be made known to you for 40 something years already that I believe he gave give people what they have need of and some people need a pastor to just hold their hands and Pat them and you know you know be good to them and I'm not throwing off on it now Heaven Help me now and you you get the wrong idea of what I'm saying that's your business but see this the man that's you know he he stays simple simple is wonderful right simple but the deepest thing in the world once it's revealed is simple now where are we going to take one and make him greater than the other no they're all in the body of Christ it doesn't matter but you know what I'm saying there's there's pastors that just stay simple with their people but you know now Pastor is not going to reject an apostle that brings a word to him now you tell me that and you're in bad shape so all right but you see then there's Apostles and there's teachers and things like that and I'm not the one that put it our brother Brown said that nobody can touch the teacher even though he's not above the Apostle neither is he above the pastor it's just the gift right it's what God has given right amen and he gives us what we have need of thank you Lorden you know I mean you go you listen to others and you you come back and you tell him me said well brother Dale they're wonderful I really enjoyed the brother but I wouldn't want to have to listen to that all the time that's not derogatory that means you have a different form of appetite or whatever you want to call it you know your digestive system is in a different form to where that you can uh eat a little meat where some people cannot eat very much meat well I'm not throwing off of I love beans and ters right I mean there's nothing I love any more than green beans I'm a professional on green beans my wife we go to a cafe especially some of these sideline things you know and I get green beans she said you want them green beans yeah I love green beans ask these nurses and things about it they studied it enough those greens are poisonous you need them in your system cuz that's fighting off things the greens you need the greens you need to eat the greens but you say but I don't want them I love steak well that's good but you can die eat and steak you need a balance all right we need a balance of the five-fold ministry that's why I call in people to get them to preach for us you know and I've told you as honest as I can tell you if I could find a true Prophet that would really just sit down and go from one to the other I would get him in here and announce about a month early you better not come cuz he going to start with me and then he's going to take in each individual and we'll see who will lay out I would be glad to do it amen I believe in a five-fold Ministry I don't believe in a onefold Ministry I don't believe in brother Dale having it all I've never taught nothing like that my dependence asked me the other night in a Bible study said brother Dale said who do you pay your tie to I pay my ti of the five full ministry I've got to pay tith you said would the preacher pay tith he ought to be the first one the prophet said it would right amen well my tithe and way we handle things here is different than all other churches anyway that ain't none of their business but I have you know I have to pay tithe well then I can take that tithe of whatever I make that year and take 10% of it and I can call in Preachers and let them come in preach to you and don't even have to off pull an offering from you I let my ti pay these ministers that come through amen he said well sometimes you pay that and too much that ain't got nothing to do with it that's you I ain't going to get much message done this evening either but he gave what you have need of that's right said there are people that just they just love the simple and the Jesus Christ but now here's my definition again I believe if Pastor should be able to teach what in the capacity of a pastor he's not to teach in the capacity of a teacher that's he's not to he he can work and he can uh see things which would be the prophet but yet he's not trying to take the prophet's place but he sees it in his capacity he can see the Apostle to set her in order of the different thing but he does it in his capacity that way then I don't look down and say no no that's we don't need that no no we need it right amen I believe every Ministry should be able to do as exactly what I said the Evangelist should be able to teach in the capacity of an evangelist that's what one brother got on to me one time about said all y'all do is let these pastors come in and teach said preach to the people said you Lord let some us evangelist in I said when you evangelist get where you preach as good as some of these pastors I'll be glad to call you and I didn't smile cuz I'm meant it and I called a brother's name I said when you get where you can preach like him I'd be glad for you to come and preach now I agree because I explained that too you ain't going to have it in the body of Christ because they're just not going to get together too much much separation that's right I proved in a Minister's meeting one time that you could take the tithe from the pastor evangelist teachers and the tithe from that would run the five-fold ministry and you would never have to take an offering for no five-fold Ministry person I proved that in the minist meeting you think anybody wanted to deal on that you got a whole lot more pastors who they paying their tithe to come on they could pay it to the Evangelist there's not as many evangelists they are pastors right there's not as many teachers they are evangelist so then the teach the Evangelist could be paying the teachers right right and God's whole work would run off of what comes through the man that's a pastor of the church but you know what no the pastor of the church he's he's got them holler Pockets you know all the tide goes to the pastor and he he's out scrb all over the country you know as an evangelist well you can't say that about me so that's all right but listen Church gifts I didn't mean to get in all that because this is this is one of my pet peeves I guess is the way people do and the way they talk about a 5f Ministry now we've got the prophet's messag amen we had a meeting years ago about something and the brother said well brother bram's not here now to straighten this out I said got the books and the tapes brother Brandon what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ a Myster of God reveal the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a new birth it's Christ in you that's settled we see what he was saying he wasn't going to listen to nobody right so then that's you know puts a lot of quetes to a lot of things but look when he gets down to the message as the eagle stir their nest 1959 he says and God is good he sends his word now watch now you read what he's saying he sends his word we've had to profit right right right amen we've had the prophet he s his word come on you reading God is good he sends his word he sent us the prophet right now watch what he said if you won't believe his word then he puts in the church five different offices that's good first apostles prophets teach that they are for the perfecting of the church then he explains everything and in each local body he put nine spiritual gifts in the local body that's gifts that goes from one to the other right you can stand up prophesy and never speak again right you can speak in tongues and never speak again right that's right come on that's right but these are ordained and predestinated of God gifts and callings are without repentance you know that here they are and God set them in the church now we've had the prophet's message but the people's not going to depend on the five-fold ministry to do what the Bible said and the prophet just said because in Ephesians it said to 54 Ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints I just get it from brother brandham I ain't listen to nobody else go ahead that's your business it's not mine I don't need you here we're getting so many babies now we're going to have to start making that wall out that way but the one thing about it we getting we getting a lot of girls you know what that means we're going to get a lot of boys church is going to be increasing we all may be dead before it is here but you all right wake you up and get you listening the prophet says it the Bible says it that the five-fold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints now but I just take what the prophet says well that's wonderful yeah the prophet just said the five four ministers for the perfecting of the sign you just you you ate your own shoe you opened your big mouth and got it in best thing do is either swallow it or spit it out because you just condemned your own self but you see then we come along and we you know you think we're trying to be this now if I was like a lot of these ministers I wouldn't be arguing with you one whatsoever there's a lot of these churches I wouldn't go to because not only is a pastor he might be preaching some pretty good but what are they doing like some of them they're gone half the time out on the field is evangelist right but you see if we believe the prophet let's do what the Prophet saids right that's he said you honor the gift God will honor you that's why people don't get anything and I don't mean nothing I don't mean you don't get nothing I just mean even here in Lula if we put our dependence upon the gift not the person not this one if I have anything to say to you it's going to be one thing I've been here 40 something years and you've got a right to stand up and say as that guy ever tried to make anything out of itself when I even a lot of times won't even tell you what God shows me of personal things or something why because I don't want you built on some form of that I want you built on whether the word is right or not come and show me where I've Twisted that word I wasn't the one that said the five4 ministers for the perfecting of the Saints the prophet said it and he said he gave us his word but if you won't take his word yeah but pay your T TI to a tape recorder yeah come on I'm serious no joke serious let me ask you one serious question as I said I can take and type in what I want to and pull it up on that screen and call it paragraph uh e14 of Jehovah Gyra and say anything I want to I didn't know they was going to do that one up but you know what I mean how do you know the tapes and the books and the deal you have any from anywhere and I'm not throwing no slangs I thoroughly appreciate all of the work that the voice of God Recordings has done around the world I am behind that 100% of their works of what they're trying to do in helping people tried to help and try to do myself but what if you what if they type something in there that brother brandham didn't say well they check it so and so so well what if so and so agrees with so and so do so and so and agrees with so and so I preached the message one time and I know you've heard it you're going to hear it again I preached a message on a little Plan called Capa this in the questions and answers on conduct order and Doctrine 64 and I I preached it as a spirital dome resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you know and like a dome on a uh Weather Vein on on the building and all the definitions and I went home and I was sitting there thinking I thought well Lord that was a pretty good thought you know I enjoyed preaching on that and something just said that's all right but it's not what I was talking about I knew the man personally that had tyed it brother Buckley I knew him knew him personally knew for years and all he done that that's what he took it off the taste and put it in topes and and I knew he had for 12 or 14 years college and if anybody had a right to know what words meant it's a whole lot better for him it was me but still there was something wrong and I said Lord what can I do I don't have no education I know how to go to a dictionary and look up the word but if if you're telling me something's wrong here how can I go to a dictionary we had the old real to real right I got that I said well the best thing I can do is at least look up listen to The Prophet So I listened to it and when he come across there he said it very and you could call him northerner if you wanted to and he said he doesn't say Capa he says capula Lord maybe maybe you use this old dummy now to find out something what does that mean I looked up the definition of Capa in the dictionary you know how they Puck P love and I said that don't fit the way he's saying it so I ran the tape and run it and listen went through the dictionaries went through I a while it's like something said change your wording from Capa I took it from copula and went back and got the word copulation and then now you go read the book or listen to the tape and see what brother Brown was talking about he's talking about the head and body uniting that is copulation CAPA is a Weather Vein over a church I come back here that night shout it wasn't a correction of brother brandom it was the correction of the ones who tyed it up and I mentioned that to the brother later and he said well you know you could be right we see the before and the after explained it he would talking about sexual intercourse between the head and the body of Christ and that's copulation now you understand what I mean yes sir sincerity of people can still take it you take brother browner's message go home and do it I wouldn't try in no way to interpret what he's trying to say but with the least education have a ninth grade education and come to find out you try to punctuate what he's saying you try to read it by their punctuation period means stop pause think on that and they got a comma do you understand what I'm trying to say without it being something that you think I'm trying to make something out of something I am I'm trying to make it out of God right this church has not been built on some man or some idea it's been built on God's word that's right as long as I'm here it'll stay that way you want to change something else you're going to get rid of me first why because I know one thing for sure we've had the word right we brought God's brought the word to you and I I'm not looking for somebody to come along and interpret that I'm looking for the Holy Spirit to come into you and I and make it live needs to be lived instead of interpreted we've got the perfect the prophet said interpretation with Divine Vindication he said right and then he turns around he says Masterpiece if you listen to that message he said it's or either see not there with a shook he said it's up to bride to vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 did you remember that out of the message it's up to the bride to do it what it's up to you and I to be the word made flesh all right let's go get off of that now one scripture that's always bothered me you know CU I know what it's saying but Paul says to seek the most Earnest gift you remember that now what does that mean am I a pastor and I'm wanting to be a teacher so I seek the most Earnest gift you know which would mean the greater gift right you know going on or would I want to be a prophet and Apostle you know is that what he talking about seek the most Earnest gift but look at this one the one that we just had there uh Jehovah Gyra e461 to2 212 the morning look what he said now then gifts where Paul said I pray earnest estly for the best gift that's Church gifts that's not offices come on you're reading there's a gift and there's an office it's an office that's a prophet all right so you remember what ago when I said a prophet's an office five four minist is an office seek the most Earnest gift is the gifts in the church right you know and that's not meaning that you try to take each other's place cuz that wouldn't be the right Spirit right it would just mean study to show yourself approved a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth and not just be satisfied with being a little baby that stays here and just casually along with this gift of of love and understanding and sweetness I heard brother Bram saying one day and something really stirred me because I didn't understand he said I'd rather see love in a church than 5,000 people be saved or maybe he might have used 10,000 oh Lord 10,000 Souls come saved or 5,000 Souls saved comparing it to love he said because if you get love in a church he said there' be a whole lot more than that saved right I thought oh God how perfect that man's language there's a lot of difference between a prophet are you reading it that's right there's a lot of difference between a prophet and a gift of Prophecy Before a gift of Prophecy really should be given in the church it has to come before two or three judges that's got the the gift of discernment to say whether it can be said but never did you see anybody stand before Isaiah to judge it prophets are not judged the only judgment you have is whether or not he tells you the truth but if he tells you the truth and you can't argue with that then you can't judge him let's make a bad scenario out of it that's big old word some of you use you know Elisha curse them children and the sheirs come out and kill 42 of them we know that that was not God that was the gift of the Prophet abbility but you think about it where would that fit in a new testament form so how could you bring an Old Testament Prophet to a New Testament you can't do that but see where would it be the Holy Spirit would ever be like Elisha was when he said that it can't be done but you know what nobody could judge that Prophet am I right right you couldn't judge him he stands before God and God alone right now he goes on down to there in that same message and he's talking about that a person comes to him and they walked up and they said brother brandom um let's see no it's in the next message expectation excuse me all right I'm about to get on the right one this is E6 E15 e16 all right coming down so watch what it gets down said not long ago a person walked up to me and said is thus sayith the Lord the Lord said do this if you don't go do it to a certain place or a certain thing and do a certain thing the Lord's going to strike you and take your gift away from you now he said thus sayith the Lord you remember them arguing there in the scriptures and the prophets said you going down there you going our 70 years man walks up it's thus sayith the Lord you be down our two years that always made silly to me anyway I'm not explain silly I know it but here Jeremiah was saying 70 years and this man he didn't say Jeremiah you're wrong we're not going into captivity that's what it sound like he ought have said no he took part of the anointing from Jeremiah's statement and said we're going to be down there two years that's thus sayith the Lord now it was thus sayith that guy because it was down there 70 years all right you know what happened to it so then what does he say so the man told him as do say he said that isn't true now that isn't true that isn't true GS and calling without repentance there's a spirit that's in the church there are spirits that's in the church that's true such as gift of Prophecy healings and so forth but they're in the entire body it may fall upon one person tonight A Prophecy and it might not never fall on that person again it might be somewhere else in the body and those Spirits are supposed to be judged let one speak into judgment now those are the spirits of the gifts that's in the church but the only person that has a right to say thus sayith the Lord is a Vindicated Prophet why because thus sayith the Lord can't be judged now I get don't say thus sayith the Lord that's what he just said to man told him is thus sayith the Lord or somebody did I get up and say that then it can be it's it's judged because it don't happen right but are you following me come on as Spirits they're in the entire body you're born with gifts trying to scan and pick up agabus was a prophet not a man with a gift of Prophecy I'm reading from demonology religious R the gift of healing and all those gifts my Pentecostal friend you got it mixed up the gifts are in the church subject to any persons in the church anybody's baptized into the body Body by one spirit with all but the gifts and callings of God are without repentance they don't heal you coming on down to the message end time ministry I think what it is gifts don't heal you all right so there's offices and there's gifts the nine spiritual gifts has to be judged okay Prophet don't have to be judged now what about a five-fold Ministry who's going to judge him now come on I ain't got it out of line and you know I ain't got it out of line because it's what I just said if a prophet prophesies a lie you don't you don't have to judge him he judged his own self if he speaks presumptuously he's judged his own self he doomed his own self the man that said he'll be down there two years he was killed or in prison died yeah he died that year why because he was off the word right so then the five-fold ministry is given to the body of Christ to break down we read there the other day from the prophet what did he say these young ministers take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord right right a five-fold Ministry sweep the message on are you coming here just because you got to have a place to pay tithe you know but then what does the ministers do with a tithe that comes in that's what I said while ago there a lot of them I wouldn't listen to I've got brother brandham where he says TI belongs to the pastor sorry I can read too brother randam got $100 a week did all the ti go to brother brandom they went in a fund that was used yes right a fund that was used to car the gospel is what the people's money went into but he got $100 a week now when brother brandham died there probably was no money in his bank account because I don't even know where he had one or not it was some money in the the old days who called a spoken word and that developed over years until they bought where they're at and Etc the voice of God Recordings but where did Brother random ever get rich where did he take all the tithe in his own pocket and yet you see congregations where the pastors driving brand new cars right and the congregation is if you want that cuz it's been said you know if you want somebody to come in and preach for you then you you take up the money right that's none of my business because it's the word of God the ti belongs to me the pastor right but then what do I do with it right this little church along I told you the other day according to the record I think there $28,000 the missionaries last year out of a handful of people well see I don't take all of it well brother Dale you got a brand new car now we're paying forart you want to stop anytime you want to I'll make the payments on it I ain't got no problem don't have a bit cuz I that's nothing to me cuz I ain't sitting in a multi-million dollar home with all kind of things I'm getting what I need but I could be a millionaire if I took the tithe and put it in a bank account for me see what I'm saying is God gave me the gift I can use my gift to sell ice cream to an Eskimo or I can use my gift to send somebody to preach to the Eskimo right all coming from my gift there's gifts in the body nine spiritual gifts that it can be on one person a day next person the next day and the next person the next day same prophecy style but that's not true with a fivefold Ministry but see we put our whole dependence upon that well brother d i put about 90% on you well then you need to go somewhere else to find where you can put to 100% because you're going to be responsible for what you do right right I'm responsible for what I do it don't matter to me what everybody else does I'm going to do what I'm going to do my wife will tell you that she says you're just plain stubborn I'll agree I'm going to do what I'm going to do and you try to my you try to change me from that if you manipulate you can get me to move with you a little bit but if you come up and tell me you want me to change I ain't going to change I'm stubborn she's shaking her head yes put the perimet on her let her head's going that's right people thinks my wife runs me around runs my money I know what's going on I know we don't get no bills but I don't worry about it but you see when it comes to this word I've got one I answer to I answer to God himself so you show me where I've ever took brother R's message and twisted it tried to make it look like something good to help me me or to make me something the fivefold ministry is to take this message and break it down to the people that's right right hey folks I still don't mind double quoting it three times quo a lot of these preachers I wouldn't fool sitting around listening to them am but they call themselves pastors and preachers right but to me there's one way to tell where a man's a preacher or not not how fast he preaches or how much he shouts or what he does what this not even how that he gives it away or not even how that he tries to help people or tries to do everything all that can be under the kind o priest but what does he do with a word the way he preaches proves what he is You Preach ER I heard of a man here while back said he was a messenger of the church and he could preach anything he wanted to always thought you could preach anything he wanted to I mean if I want to preach era you know what brother brandham even said brother brandham said if the brandham Tabernacle now if I misquote this you get it right he said he said if they vote for brother Neville to preach Jehovah Witness Doctrine he said that's the leading of the Lord that's what he said he didn't say God made it that way he said that's the leading and he said I don't have a right to say anything but I like that quote your pastor's ordained to lead you through it's not in there in them words it's my statement goes the end of if he's ordained cuz he's really referring to brother Neville and speaking back toward about brother Neville and said that's on Christ Myster God revealed in the little section of where it's the black letter of the word to the church kind of but you see if he stays with the truth then we honor the donkey right we honor the donkey and we say thank you Lord for using the donkey amen that's right bring us the word let's stand come on musicians I hope you understand yes because I believe the five-fold ministry the gift that I have is predestinated eternally from God I said it the way I meant it I meant it the way I said it the gift that I have within me if it is the gift of God it's predestinated eternally from God the person out here I've got a lot of problems with him I'm a human element that's got a lot of problems right see that way then you just look over the problems and you listen to the word but now I'm not dumb stupid may be a little it but not dumb I'm not going to sit down and listen to No preacher that's a polygamist that's a whatever you want to call him and he's out here running in all of this stuff and the junks and doing the things of the world and then me sat down there and play my but he's my pastor he's ordained to leave me me through he's going to do it he's going to lead you through he's going to lead you right through hell that's exactly where he's going to lead you to so then what do you do do as the prophet said pastor don't stay with a word what do you do you leave the pastor yeah but I'm the pastor of Lula Georgia I am the leader of all of Lula one guy used to say he is Pastor George I think but I'm not quite that way I hope you understand I give all the honor and glory to almighty God cuz there's anything that I've ever preached he gave it to me I didn't study it and GRE Alman and my wife will tell you I don't sit at home I'm not throwing off on anybody that does but I don't listen to internet I don't play with none of that stuff I'm not on YouTube Just tubes and Bs and Bobs and all these other things and all these Facebooks and things like that that that's right you better be careful what you're doing on there you know that all of that is public domain right and why do you want to fool with it I'm just honest uh he ask for don't raise your hands how many Listen To Masterpiece see not there with a Shook and there's two of those and identified Masterpiece of God that goes in how many of you listen to that or read it but how many of you stayed on the Facebooks and the things like that and didn't have time to listen to that so now you know where your God is at amen am I hateful no truthful truthful see you prove what we are we're showing what we are read Love Story magazine right here's the greatest love story it's ever been and this Bible is the greatest love story that has ever been but yet people love to read about what somebody else does cuz they want to do it but they just can't afford to do it because they sure what it was okay what do we got I may know him that I may know him I may know him wonderful that I may know Wonderful you know I don't understand brother Ryan came to me a while ago and he said brother Dale I got to work tonight he said I'll probably get up and leave a little early and he just now walked out to go he said when you get through preaching I'll get up and go out well he was sincere enough to tell me cuz you know I'd see here and i' see you go out my wife got up this morning walked out I knew she was sick well see that distracts that changes my thoughts but he didn't want to change my thoughts he wanted me to know bl's good bless God I ain't telling you none of my business none of your business what I do are you honoring the gift all I ask are you honoring the gift cuzz listen folks this old boy is not nosy and this old boy don't talk about what you tell me even to my wife if you tell me I don't nobody knows it me and you the one who knows it cuz I'm not interested in Gossip I could care less about what the rest of the world of this message is doing except for one thing trying their best to get into the word and become the word that we can walk off of this Earth I'm not on the phone all the time what about s you you heard the latest we are 99% of the time the last one here to find out something a lot of people here knows more about what's going on in this church and I do you know why cuz they're nosy no now brother I
