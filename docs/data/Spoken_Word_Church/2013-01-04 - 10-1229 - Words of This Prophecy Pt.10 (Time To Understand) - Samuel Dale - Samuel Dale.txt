seeing the word right good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Revelations 1 where we've been reading at and we'll also read Malachi the 4th chapter amen glad to have everybody with us tonight GL to have brother Daniel and all of his family with us and all of them there from from New Mexico and they will be leaving I thank the Lord willing Friday or Thursday Friday going home so pray for them that that's right as they travel along the highway Lord give them a safe trip remember Anna Richard will be traveling back also so just keep all of these in mind we we appreciate the Lord appreciate the day that we're living and I'll remember the watch Night Service will be starting at 8:00 we'll sing for maybe about 20 30 minutes and then uh you know start into a regular service and I told Wade last night in June I said well I cut two hours off he said what'd you do that far I said because of the other four or six it already had so uh I cut a couple of hours off the message that I can preach it another time and uh so you know I pray that uh you'll bring your questions and answers we get through in time we'll have questions and answers and and all and talking about one true and living God Amen so we'll be studying on that amen Revelations 1 Malachi 4 Lord Jesus we thank you we love you thank you for the day in the hour that we're living in the time father upon the Earth here that we have thank you for you and we pray that you would just bless us with understanding ears that we may hear what you would have to say unto us Lord we could prepare and speak or whatever and use uh words but words would only um help us to understand and I pray that you would just guide us and that you would take the words then and let it be in the hearts of the Saints and Lord bless us tonight we love you thank you for all things and just have your way in Jesus name amen thank you everyone for all of the uh Christmas gifts from my wife and myself and we just truly appreciate it and from the bottom of our hearts amen Revelations 1 and Malachi 4 Josh I've got just a little bit of a course I hope you get more out there tonight up them just a little bit but I'm pulling a little bit back here it's like the speakers are behind me so maybe we're we're hooked in on something else but that's good there you go just make sure you get it out there right cuz the ones up here they can hear well enough amen pull it back down there you go okay Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right Malachi 4 very familiar with all of us fifth verse behold I send you you thank you Lord amen not everybody it's only for you all right behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you see all of these quotes things that are laying up here uh maybe we won't be here all night but uh we we try not to if you think this is a a lot you to see what's on my desk for what's not so come and let's have a good time together talking about the Lord amen now we've been speaking for quite a while on this topic of we've been titled it the words of this prophecy and uh you know trying to get down to a point to give us a better understanding of the Bible and the things that uh you know now we know that we're not trinitarians we know that brother brandham was not a trinitarian but neither was he a denominational Oneness right he had the correct understanding we had better believe it if not we better find us somebody else to follow but I believe he had the correct understanding as it's in your notes Dar that he said on the conduct order and Doctrine message that we have the uh perfect interpretation by Divine Vindication all right now uh if we don't believe that we certainly better get up and go somewhere else and try to find something because I believe that we're running out of time all right but now what I want us to think about is the message that we preached prior to this and we we've had to miss some Services because of weather and things like that but you know that's that's the Lord's doings not mine and uh but the last message I was trying to get you to see just one point the prophet said hold up a point until the people see it and then move on and uh but what was we talking about that God is unchangeable Malachi 3 he says I'm God and I change not right therefore the sons of Jacob can be preserved in other words we have a hope why would it say talk about Jacob there see we have a hope because Jacob is relating to the flesh man you know Israel was the spiritual man and the the sons then of Jacob could have an opportunity and you and I can have an opportunity but you see if God does something one way now your Prophet said over and over he's got to do it again the same way because he can't change amen you say well it looks like it well I don't care what it looks like uh I don't care what it looks like you got to believe the Bible and where he said I'm God and I changed not and you got to believe the prophet's message and forget your ideas one brother one time said he had a bunch of questions written out about marriage and divorce and said I wanted to ask brother brandham these questions you know and said one day the Lord spoke to him and said are you going to believe what my Prophet said are you going to believe what you used to believe that's right that solved that problem didn't it you know so then you know if God ever healed anybody see that's all we put it on we we put that when brother R said God is unchangeable we put it on the basis of if God ever healed anybody and the same person receive that same Faith he's got to be healed uh if God ever saved one person you know he's he's got to save the next one if they reach the same position but see I I look at it like this if we're going to believe that God is real M then he cannot change his mind he could never have a second thought about the way to do anything his first thought would have to be pure and original and and and you can't change it so the way he would do anything now this is a background for Wednesday night because I believe I mean Friday night I believe that uh Revelations 1 shows you the key to understand how the Bible is written and see then I believe like Wade was covering it see on the the services the other day because he had caught something I was talking about on it and he put it into his message cuz he's kind of like me when he gets something he can't keep it he has to go ahead and tell you cuz I don't keep anything I don't have uh things written in my secret notes to be able to preach 20 years from now I just go day by day and you know kind of take it as I get it but see we look at Genesis 1 and compare that with Revelations one and you can see that God don't change that's right all right but see you can't read into Genesis one the way of looking at it the way you can read in in Revelations 1 right amen but just remember if he done it one way in Genesis he must do it that way in Revelation or if he done it that way in the Book of Revelation he must do it must have done it all the way down cuz the only way he he's trying to reveal himself now and in doing that see we see the order of how he reveals himself in Revelations 1 what does it say and we've been over this and over it sure does sound like trinitarianism don't it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him y now however what this was God gave it under Jesus Christ right I sound like trinitarianism doesn't it they mean that doesn't confuse your mind that doesn't make you wonder what's going on that's right but to me it's the most beautiful thing are the way of understanding how God does write the Bible amen right right now remember this point it doesn't say here that it's the revelation of Jesus that's amen that God gave unto his Angel to signify him through his Angel and servant John it doesn't say that if it did then we'd be Oneness right amen or we need to be trendy but by the way that it says it it put it perfectly to where that you can understand the Bible amen the Bible is not to reveal Jesus amen oh no wa a minut brother now listen amen it's to reveal Jesus Christ amen that's right and Jesus Christ is almighty God Amen all right now I gave you some quotes in there we'll get to it in a minute maybe we just go ahead and down cover it it's the one that doesn't have any writings on it you know numbers on it okay you start off at the top on future home I didn't meend to bring these but I figured I'd better bring it on and and put it out because it's like brother Keith Reed said one time to me and I've tried to do that ever since he said brother Dale your people know what you're talking about but said people on the Airways that are hearing a lot of times they don't know what you're saying because they have not had the background to to understand all right so I just try to give it to you what the prophet said amen that's right so in that way I don't have to worry about it you know because your Prophet said If you're looking at it in the future home page 10 the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ right amen now he doesn't say it's a revelation of Jesus right amen neither does he just say it's a revelation of Christ now you may find those quotes right but just remember what he's saying it's the revelation of Jesus Christ he said there is his body Christ revealed his own word 65 8:22 he said so the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and it was wrote by prophets Hebrews 1 and let get what I underline and you read all between if it doesn't match up cuz he said Jesus Mali Jesus was Jeremiah Jesus forah it's not a book of simp systems a c code of moral ethics neither is it a history book right or a book of theology now he's telling the Bible is not these things it is not but it's a revelation of Jesus Christ Christ God revealed himself from word to flesh and that's what it is the Bible is the word and God is the flesh now it corrects it's a what God in God is the word rather and Jesus being the flesh it's a revelation how God the word was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us and that's why he becomes a Son of God he is a part of God he said you understand H so look what he's saying going down in Christ revealed in his own word paragraph 6 56 and said uh talking about the preaching of the same Paul and Peter meeting they were preaching the same he said that's our Bible in other words they were preaching the same word thing word by word that's our Bible let other man's words fail this no man can add to it you remember if you add to the book or take away what the problem is you add to the revelation of the book you take away from the revelation of the book what have you got oh the way it is now the great things that open the seventh seal is revealed to me and I just make it what I want it well that's you you face that with God CU that's you know I'm going to face him what I say right all right but look what he said that's our Bible let other men's words fail there no man can add to it you don't add no more to the Bible no sir this is a complete Revelation that's all all right now I just gave you the one there of uh 105 paragraph 105 questions and answers where brother Brown said we have the perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine vind Vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child when I become a man I put away childish thing see and I go to preaching and don't get these now remember that in a minute we'll come back to that okay now flip it over and think about what your Prophet is saying think about what is saying to you there because the title of the message tonight will be as I said it's a words of this prophecy number 10 and the title is time to understand I think it's time to understand folks if it's not I don't know when it will be and I tell you what we don't have 40 more years because that would make me 110 and you know what that' make a lot of y'all older than that right so we better consider that you right now brother Al he can Crow because he's following me he won't I he calls sir until he did till September then he was all right he caught up with me but now listen the Revelation that God gave to Jesus all right to give it to John he said signified it you know made it plain or understood to the angel now you know there was evidently something Jesus didn't know right see now if you was a Oneness you'd be jumping down my throat yeah because you'd be saying now wait a minute he Jesus was almighty God I agree with you amen but you see we put him as and this is for Friday night really good we limit got Jesus to not knowing all things because that he was in human flesh that's a good point that'll hold you for a while but that's not the Bible don't you remember years ago and most of you got mad at me about it you probably still are because I exposed it I asked you a simple question one day and that's been about 20 something years ago and I ask a simple question I said we were ask back when the son of man was being preached and everybody was preaching son of man son of man and I asked you I said when is the first time in your mind if I say son of God when did you when did you lock in that the Son of God came in to be and I gave everybody an opportunity to get up and say they didn't do it so then I told you then everybody here had the same thought see of course now you wouldn't agree with it but that's all right see Son of God was the word or logos that went out of God in the beginning am well you're a trinitarian well let's see if it'll fit the Bible see most people think Son of God was 2,000 years ago on the shores of Galilee but you better remember even the three Hebrew children when the man looked down in there he said one liken the Son of God right amen your Scholars knew and brother brandham covered it over and over that the logos the theophany the word that went out of God was the son of God he said God gave birth to his first son right or to himself as a son right either way you want to State it we see we say well now brother Dale what you do is you just confuse us we thought we had it figured out no I didn't confuse you if what I'm saying makes you think you're confused then remember you was already confused I just exposed it right see people don't like me because of that but that's the only way I can save your soul so if you get mad at this body go ahead but if your soul is saved on the day that I'm there and meet you I'll be tickled to death and there won't be no problems cuz you see I got to look back at the word amen and see what the word says read what your Prophet said when he was talking about that little Halo of light question go to gen to uh cont ordering Doctrine book one and just start reading and you'll get about page 21 and you'll see what I'm talking about that the logos was the theophany the Son of God that's why that when Peter looked at Jesus and Jesus said who the man say I the son of man am Peter didn't say you are a son of man he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God you're the creator of God because Christ was the creator of God Amen Jesus was the creator of God right am but you see we get all tied up in our thoughts and think we Haven it figured out of one God and when we do we wind up to see how confused we are cuz the Bible said the Revelation that God gave to Jesus to give to John well it's evident that Jesus didn't understand so well I just don't I don't understand that well pray right because confusion sure don't help us right and brother Rand said it like this bring me a question on it bring it to me you know this Friday night the prophet said questions makes a strong church amen that's right cuz one thing it means you're thinking right another thing that means that God can give us the answer cuz he's always got the answer that's right I don't have them I I told you about that I just know somebody that does haveen but see you say well well I don't understand it it it says the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave unto him who to Jesus Christ amen it's not the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave unto John that's true we know it but this was what God gave unto Jesus Christ for Jesus Christ to come personally brother R said page 13 Church AG book The Only book in the Bible whereas that Jesus coming personally to ascribe amen all right see it's a time to understand but look what he says in Revelations chapter uh 1 you got on your notes there which is 1960 1204 the morning service when our Lord was on Earth the disciples asked him and said Master will you at this time restore the kingdom back to Israel now watch what I'm saying they ask him in another time right when are you going to come and he says I don't know only the father knows that's that scripture now the prophet is using another scripture the scripture of what at this time restore will you at this time restore the kingdom back to Israel and Jesus said it's not for you to know this hour or time and no one would know said even the son as yet did not know but after his death burial and resurrection and Ascension into Glory he receives from God the future of the church then he turned back to bring this message to the church and the message of his coming and the condition of the church down through the age right he could not do it before his death burial and Resurrection because he had not yet knew it but did you notice how the scripture reads here the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him now listen to it how that God the Father gave the Revelation to his son Jesus Christ amen now that's what your Prophet is saying is he a trinitarian cuz see you make me one because I read it you know right you make me one cuz I can read what he said well why don't you make him one because you read what he said right how that God the Father gave the Revelation to his son Jesus Christ and he sent his Angel to John to signify these things which was which was which is and which shall be all it set beautifully now look at the next one page 14 Church age book these men were still thinking of Jesus having an Earthly Kingdom but it was a spiritual Kingdom that he was going to build even and he could not tell them about his place in it for the father had not yet revealed it unto him but after his death and resurrection and at this particular time in his mediatorial ministry he is able to set forth in this revelation of himself to John what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do right now that's what's your Propet said now the next about three are illustrating so let's read them illustrating what brother Brown is talking about e13 angel of the Lord preached 1951 7:18 when some Blind Men followed him he touched their eyes and said now listen to these things and you'll see what happened in the Bible right of course if you don't want to pay no attention to it that's your business what he touched their eyes now Jesus touched the eyes and said according to your faith be it unto you that was not the father right well let's just keep reading the father had not showed him nothing about that he just touched their eyes but when calling Lazarus never remember I can show you the quote where brother R said God had already showed him and showed him to keep going right to not turn around and come back y all but when calling Lazarus where he seen he said Lazarus come forth and to the other people who the father had who the father had showed him by vision and what he was to do he called them and so forth then when the others come by he touched them and said according to your faith all right now that is found in John 5:19 that the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father doing right Amen brother brandom said he never done nothing until he saw a vision right Jesus saw a vision well you sure do sound like you're trying to make two or three gods what are you doing that's an easy way to say it look at the next one do you now believe paragraph or E 11 which preached 1952 8:17 now Jesus done nothing now why didn't he heal that man or the Twisted man or the lame man or the halt man now why didn't he do it is because the father had not showed him is that right do you believe that's a reason and he only heal what the father showed him then if he said a little while in the world seeth me no more yet you'll see me no more for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world is that right going down door of the door preach 57212 e45 Lazarus the resurrection all these things the father had showed him and there was a little woman coming to the audience and she did not the father had not showed her listen showed him nothing concerning her but she believed so she she went through the crowd and she touched His Garment and went out and sat down and Jesus turned and said now who has touched me Y and re Peter rebuked him said the Lord the whole crowd touched him why'd you say that but see there's a Doctrine now in the people of the message that says that you can't take what Jesus says you got to take what the father says oh yeah and sometimes Jesus was talking and sometimes the father was talking so we got to figure it out of course they're the only ones who knows which ones talking that's the reason they're saying it that way see they can divide between the two but uh we not make it this exactly what he said but get the point now God revealed unto Jesus Jesus Christ The Book of Revelation now Mark that down hold on it just a minute see because the Bible is not the revelation of Jesus but it's a revelation of Jesus Christ right now I've tried my best for about 20 well 30 years or more to tell you when I'm talking about Jesus I know how to say Jesus and mean flesh but when I say Jesus Christ I am not talking about the flesh now how many messages has that been on when I say Jesus Christ when the prophet says Jesus Christ when the Bible says Jesus Christ it is not talking about the 16 elements of the man right I do not believe that Jesus Christ in human flesh come to John on patas right why why did he come to him and say well he give it to the angel and well then Jesus is standing here and the angel is standing here and they standing there no I try to preach that to you over and over you better get that angel out of your way give him his rightful position like I told him while coming to church tonight there's no greater position than you could give brother brandom than for him to bring to bring the revelation of the entire Bible to you and I to where we can comprehend it there's nothing greater could be made that's right that's right but why is it in Revelations 1 that it never hardly even mentions it that angel it doesn't mention that angel is to him that angel is giving him and helping him do it but John's one's writing the Angel's not writing now we're going to get to it in a minute and let's see what you say about it cuz why was it that brother Ram's angel that was with him from birth could not tell him what the seals were that's right that's right come on he told him about serpent seed he told him about many things but he couldn't tell him about the seals he had to wait sure see we're going to get into something might be interesting notice now my point the entire Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ not Jesus the Flesh and it is not the revelation of just the Christ right it is the revelation of Jesus Christ right amen and Jesus Christ is almighty God Amen yep or else you're going turn now the time to understand the time to understand now let's read a few notes number one on your notes Revelation chapter 1 1960 1204 the morning service he said now that now time is at hand what when the complete revelation of Jesus Christ has been made known to his churches amen and the ages go by it's just revealed to them now what is the time to understand when the Book of Revelations when the entire Bible the complete Revelation is revealed to man right of Jesus Christ as I said then I gave it to you a moment ago there conduct order and Doctrine where the Prophet said we have the perfect interpretation of the Bible with Divine Vindication right so there can't be anything else to be coming to be added or added Revelations or added things while we're here in this world now can be a messages here out to the endless ages but they can't be anymore added here right because it's the complete Revelation Revelations book of symbols 19566 17 look you know he's reading down blessed the man reading today to hear the words of this prophecy and those and keep those things which are written there in for the time is at hand oh my if we just could go into it right now look when is the time at hand when is the time at hand when the revelation of Jesus Christ has been revealed to the body of Christ I'm reading right watch and Christ has re been revealed not dead but alive living in his church doing the same things he did the same Ministry the same gospel the same sign the resurrected Christ when he's revealed by his Angel into the church then the time is at hand and never a time since that day until this has the mystery of Jesus Christ been revealed until these last few years then the time is at hand the time is at hand the time to understand and you ever thought about this I like to make you think sister Gil said brother they make you think about I like to make you think have you ever thought about it what if the Book of Revelations had never been written now I know that's okay we are okay come come you know it didn't happen but what if it happen what is the Book of Revelation that have never been written now you'll see this is tying together to what I'm trying to say because if the Book of Revelations had never been revealed it don't make no difference how long it has been written that's right it is no good unless it is revealed right amen but think about it a minute what kind of a Bible would you have without the Book of Revelation right you know what you would have you would have the revelation of one God you have the revelation of redemption for the soul right but you would not have the Revelation or the writing of redemption for the body I want you to show me that yeah but Paul said you that's right Paul prophesied now remember this is the words of this prophecy there's a lot of difference between prophesy or prophesying and prophecy prophecy is the bringing together of the entire word of God and reveal it to prophecy is somebody speaking all right now so you would have Paul and all he said about the change but where was anybody change that's right right you would have great things don't misunderstand me you would have great things but you would not have the complete Plan of Redemption right amen you would only have the point of Salvation you would have uh as much as to Philip to be translated for 300 miles you know youd have great things that you could speak of but it is in the Old Testament were that those men like Enoch was not because God took him Elijah was taken up in a chariot the Lord Jesus Christ is the only one in the New Testament that was taken up right right see you would not have the complete Plan of Redemption you say well I don't know about that now I tell you what well all right you preach it to me I'll give you the pull pit we got tomorrow night you want it I'm not joking and I'm not sarcastic I wish you'd give me that opportunity to be able to speak and to speak plain enough brother BR said if you don't make it plain people are think you're trying to pull something over on them right that's one thing for sure I don't want you to think about me is I'm trying to pull something over on you that's right what I needed I got all I need I don't need anything else what good would it do in this day but do you see what I'm talking about when you have the perfect interpretation by Divine Vindication of the message of the hour to understand the revelation of Jesus Christ the time is at hand right that's right the time to understand the time to walk off and then what did we do when we took the Book of Revelations in chapter 1 that immediate the Lord Jesus Christ comes on the scene to John and immediately he takes him and immediately he's taken to the place and position of even the white Throne right cuz that's where he's at when he fell down there at his feet in Revelations 1 cuz he sees the bride one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks right G about the path that's femin we've been over it and over it why we're not a denomination brother R says he saw the bride That's right The Book of Revelations takes you into eternity amen the first chapter even shows you the bride at the white Throne judgment not to set on but to set on the Judgment with him not to be judged amen it shows you automatically right up to the White drum read what your Prophet had to say about it and I don't have any quotes you got a computer that's where I got mine out of the message of the hour right course this is nothing new for me could have been preaching it for what 40 years right but now let's get something right here that to me is a very valuable thing to understand the Bible to understand the prophet's message to understand anything now what is most of you know what that means that brother Dale has to see anything from part realization to perfect realization cuz that's the only way I know it's right right cuz I believe that's the way the prophet done it that's right I believe his message went from partial realization that he didn't know everything you believe he knew everything when he come there's people that believe that but I don't because he said he didn't that's right that's all right even Jesus didn't know it I'll get back to that point so don't worry about it we'll cover more on Friday night about Jesus not knowing to see more of the Bible but you see if you can't look at something in partial realization and go to perfect realization I I don't know whether you're right or not like my old saying is what you start off in Genesis with a what a white dog and you wind up in the Book of Revelation with a cow or horse or something you say Glory Hallelujah I got an animal well you're not in the Bible right if you wind up in the Book of Revelation you start out in Genesis Genesis 1 reveals a white horse I'm just giving you illustration right Revelation one got to reveal a white horse Revelation 22's got to reveal a white horse cuz if you change you didn't do what God said he said I'm God and I change not he never changed in his revelation but he can keep adding to what he brings right he can keep unfolding what he brings right did not Jesus understand about the the the world and the things and the the things of the Kingdom he just didn't know his part in it right that's what your Prophet said but when he come to the a of patmas then he knew am you think he didn't have a shot in time but listen see the Book of Revelations then had to be written because you would only have God revealed as one God and the things of the Old Testament showing Jesus and Jesus Christ and how it would be one God and how he would be living in the Saints and how he would be building the statue of a perfect Man how he would be doing all of those things but it would not be a complete Plan of Redemption right The Book of Revelation is not the revelation of who Jesus is but this revelation of his future part of it now let's see what your Prophet had to say look at number three on your note page 13 re Revelation which is 13 Church H book all right it is the last book of the Bible yet it tells the beginning and the end of the dispensation of the Gospel now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described an example of a sculpture unveiling his work of Statuary exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it is the revelation of his future work in the the oncoming seven Church ages right amen okay keep on reading this is page 14 now I said that the Book of Revelation is a revelation of Jesus and what he is doing in the churches for those Seven Ages it is a revelation because the disciples themselves did not know these recorded truths now this is actually the one I was reading a while ago so I want to go ahead and read it it is a revelation because disciples themselves didn't know these recorded truths it had not been previously revealed to them you remember that they came to Jesus in the book of Acts and asked him are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel and he said it is not for you to know the times or the seasons these men were still looking for Jesus having these men were still thinking of Jesus having an Earthly Kingdom but it was a spiritual Kingdom that he was going to build even he could not tell them about his place in for the father had not revealed it unto him but now after his death and resurrection and his at this particular time in his mediatorial ministry he's able to set forth here in this revelation of himself to John what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do that's a repeat of what the other right now so it's revealing what he would be doing in the ages actually the Book of Revelation shows him to being revealed as what was what is and shall be Hebrews 13:8 right right okay so now revealing his part of what he's doing I brother around and said that Jesus fulfilled his part but said he didn't fulfill it all now you need that quote he said because he left something for you and I Y something for you and I that's why I made the statement and I keep making the statement go to the Book of Revelations and show me Jesus standing anywhere by himself right come on you say no what what that mean it mean just what it says show me Jesus anywhere in the Book of Revelation by himself you don't see him in the book of Revelations outside of in his bride or in Bride form are connected with his bride other than when he turns to Israel and then you see him with Israel right he said what about that lamb over there well you better go back and study a little bit what your Prophet had to say because remember the lamb had opened the book that lamb had seven horns and seven eyes which is the seven horns which come from and your Prophet said that lamb came from the church ages right amen abely the church ages gave birth to that lamb as the Old Testament prophets gave birth to Jesus Christ right he's not there by himself cuz it's not the revelation of Jesus Amen it's a revelation of Jesus Christ look at the next one page 74 Christ a mystery of God reveal which is number five on your notes then what he's the head of the body 1963 7:28 which is his church bride uh-huh then the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery amen it's impossible for it not to go oh my it's part of God's mystery how God revealed himself here and raised it up by the word word so he reveals the church and raises it up by the same word it's part of his threefold mystery amen you remember the three-fold mystery all God was he put in Christ all Christ in the church take them back to the Garden of Eden amen all right do you need these parts expectation and what is love number six on your notes how many is Born Again amen say amen amen how many of you is Born Again amen amen now watch what he said do you know each one of you is a Creator right amen you are a part of God right amen you are a son of God right am an offspring of God that's right a daughter of God is that right then you're a Creator see everybody wants to I like when he says things like that I like to find them okay where he says you're a daughter you know cuz everybody thinks the men's the only one supposed to be doing anything I like that my wife don't like it when I make them faces that goes on in videos out there cuz my face is not to them out there to you for people to think that God thinks so much of his bride oh she was just a byproduct well she was in Adam all the rest of the animals wasn't in there mate that's right she was in Adam am God thought that much of you sisters thank you Lord that's right course I know what the fall was and what happened yeah and I know the deceptiveness and the things of that and I I know the sisters can be a thousand times more deceived than a man I know that that's not talking about how much education you got right or how much sense you got it's talking the plain truth I was thinking about it the other day I know I get aggravated sometimes what I think about and telling you you know a man he he loses his wife he goes out every once he goes around he does this you know he might stay by himself then he might not right but you know them women they get there and they get about 3 months after their husband's dead they take off the black garments oh that's the way I think why I tell you you know what I'm saying women don't wear no black garments no more you take off the garments of the old husband and you go buy you some new clothes and you get all prettied up you know what you're doing you're looking for a man and you're easier to be deceived now that's what your Prophet said in the Bible says so you argue with them just get mad at brother Dale for saying it that's just pick on me that's all right that's no problem but listen look what he said future home 1964 802 he said see only the predestinated was the only will only be the one that does it only can be and you only can do it because look it proves predestination cuz if you got eternal life you had to be a part of God all times cuz he's the only one that's Eternal right now if you got eternal life that eternal life is a part of God right amen right his children are his children right look at the next one this is one I like lean not to your own understanding 1965 120 paragraph 17 so you see if you were in the forn knowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God because you predestinated unto adoption you ever noticed that right right people don't read that part they predestinated they don't see read where it says you're predestinated unto adoption unto means something you are coming to right you will eventually reach that you are not there but you will reach that un and if you're in for knowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God and the only way you can be a Son of God or a daughter of God you had to be a part of God now listen and God isn't complete without you amen amen now you want to shout over that that God isn't complete without you why cuz he United himself to you by the new birth he gave you part of his life amen he's not complete without you amen has to be that's right cuz there's only one only one resource of eternal life and that is God and him alone has eternal life see now and you were a part of him in so much that you are an attribute or in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives you a little tug towards him that has to be quickened all right that's it now you're a part of God you're a child of God he's not complete without you right so the Book of Revelations even though the bride could be shown in there with Paul Peter Etc the writings but you know yourself there's very little written about the church and the reason was because it was going to come to the aisle of patmas with John and he was going to write about the church you see God's not complete without you amen right if you have eternal life right amen so then being a part of God we're a part of the Revelation we're part of the mystery the prophet of God said that this end time messenger would be pointing to the skies amen at the coming of Jesus Christ to a word born bride so I hope you're understanding now why the book of revation had to be written because it has to be listen now I'll say this and I'll back off see the Book of Revelations is the writing about the church in action right it is the book of Acts repeated again but in the book of Acts was only enough to get them into the body of Christ and get them to the Statue of a perfect man to worthy that says brotherly kindness and true baptism but the headstone did not come yet that's right is that the words of the Prophet that's right now why did he say that when was it the headstone hadn't come back there listen folks The Headstone couldn't come until the body is complete right right there's only a prophecy of its coming until it is complete but the Book of Revelation shows the bride complete when it shows it there in Revelations 133 one standing in the midst of the S golden Candlestick like unto the son of man G about to pouch for the golden girdle it's so great d until John actually starts to bow down to the feet of that one and Jesus raised him up y he had just saw the bride in Perfection yep but see we don't see ourselves that way we see our garbage cans that we live in we see one another in our ways and our actions and our doings we don't see ourselves as God sees us if we ever did get to the place we saw ourselves that way don't worry about it you're not going to run off into a garbage can of the world if you're a child of God to say you're perfect you mean you say well brother Dale You Preach perfect to the people and you try to get them to see how perfect they are and they're going out into sin the bride won't do it that's right that's right that's why your Prophet said it he said you can't get a born again woman to put on a pair of pants that's right now why did he make that statement right because it's true amen he said a born again brother h i put on some well I'd check to find out whether I born again or not that's right absolutely amen you say brother Dale Don't Preach clo line Holiness no I preach a higher line of Holiness than it's ever thought about on that line that's right because if Jesus Christ is in you and in me how can he live any other way than what he lived on this Earth that's right right there's a true revelation of Holiness that's right cuz it's not how long your sleeves are how much you it's what's in your heart well then I just got to do what want you see then you prove you're not saved that's right come on that proves you're not Sav right I do what I want to I want to serve him walking around in the garbage can yesterday he was right yesterday walking around Walmart that's what I call him you know what I'm talking about filth on every hand we didn't know anything about BB leis and them didn't find it out until we got home I was walking around too that was all that garbage can me you know you look up and there's one hanging up the ceiling you look on here you we're human right all at once something said why don't you get that and give it to Lisa and tell her congratulations said my Lord is that just a good thought we went on to another place or doing something in a little bit it says call her on the phone tell her congratulations hallelujah thank you Father you know what I thought I thought there ain't no way in the world in Walmart I'm going to call Lisa and tell her congratulations because she would shout this place down screaming in holl and they'd have her in a straight jacket but then we get home and they call you see church it's not how good you are what you are it's what he is right I've never tried to get you to see nothing but him right of how great he is amen we're not what garbage can God hasn't complete without us Soul cuz he joined himself to us that's right he saved us amen right come on bless see without the Book of Revelations you would only see God as being revealed to us as God and you would see like Paul speaking of of chains and the m in the twinkle eye you'd see the prophecies you'd see all of the things but he you would never see the fullness of God right because it was not shown there other than prophecies but the Book of Revelations is not a prophecy not prophesying it's a prophecy right prophecy is actuality of what has already happened right yep right that's what I've been trying to get you to see prophesying is talking about something to come prophecy means see why you know it's on the tap on language you can't hardly understand it but the word prophecy p r o p h e c y means that you're looking at something that has already turned out in God to be real and you see it in the book amen and he done wrote about it amen that's right he done show the bride how Eternal she is right he shows her in chapter one how's Eternal and how great she is that's right amen chapter 2 and three CHS are what Overcomers amen chapter 4 shows her in Rapture right how much more greater would we want to know what God thinks about us but listen see without the Book of Revelation you would have only partial realization of the Bible that's right you would not have perfect realization or perfect Revelation right you would have partial realization that's right all right you wouldn't have the complete Plan of Redemption that's right you would only have the part showing you a partial realization see the Redemption of the body and the world and the things like that could only be prophesied by man back dire it could not be shown in a reality but the Book of Revelation get what I'm talking about come on Gary get it the Book of Revelation is not a prophesying of something right it's actually a fulfilled proph that God is showing us the picture of it that's it it's not something to come it's already there right and the disciples didn't know the mystery that's right they didn't know the mystery of the change of the body come on Paul could only prophesy he never made it manifest right he went to the Grave right that's why he could scream out No Grave where your Victory death where you steam he could CED out yes because he was living in a world of reality of real revelation of God Amen but he still couldn't bring it into reality y only the Lord Jesus Christ could take it because he he's the only one who reached immortality y now do you see why the angel of the prophet of God could not tell him what the seals are do you see see why the angel of God that was with the prophet from birth could not tell him what those seals are he would have to wait until somebody else came another Mighty Angel right y that's all I'll say but he was waiting that angel couldn't tell him cuz all that angel knew was what was written in the book but that angel could tell him what was in the book book it could tell him certain things in the Book of Revelations but he couldn't tell him about the seals and the complete Revelation cuz it was not made known right see it was not written in plain language for man to understand he wrote in symbolics you'd have to wait until the prophet would be able to come see could not be made known what time to understand righten see you believe that brother random was born to Prophet amen but why didn't he know everything when he's here that's right lot of people believed he did but he said he didn't now going to believe him amen but why he didn't know everything did he now either he lied or whatever so you can do what you want to with it he said on that first s he said I don't know what it is and he said I made a horrible meetic if the Holy Ghost had not come to straighten him out on that he would have preached a white horse rider as the Holy Ghost cuz he'd already preached he take away all of his ministry he said I don't make a horrible mistake if he hadn't to come who's the he see that's what everybody wants to do they think it's so great a revelation oh brother Dale you're belittling brother Bram because we believe and all across the land the Great names are preaching now that brother random was the one that come to John on patas you hadn't heard that hang on or listen a little bit maybe you already open your ears up right cuz some of you sat here the other day when that man was preaching it didn't catch it then he even said it man he preached just recently here that's right preach that brother brandham was the one that come to on P how many of you caught it was you asleep right well now you're so revelated you didn't need to listen yeah you see okay now you say brother there you get upset no that ain't upset if it is the Holy Ghost is upset why can't you hear what people say right that's right but you can hear everything I say that's a little wrong you let me make a quote wrong somewhere and somebody will meet me before I get outside you said that [Music] wrong but these others no why was it that Jesus didn't know his part in the kingdom come on that's right the same reason that Jesus didn't know his part in the kingdom is the same reason the angel of the Lord that was with brother brandham that told him about serpent SE that told him about all these great things come on did he tell him about it did he show him in the word but when it come to them seals and things that angel didn't tell him about marriage and divorce that's right it took the great one to come amen that's right that's that right but you see everybody thinks that you got to breach something to be great Keling tzing things you know to make them make people oh I just I can just see how brother random come to General patas I told you what I want to know I want to know what the angel told you right amen I want to know what the angel told brother brandom amen not what brother brandham told John if that's who that was I want to know what the angel told brother Brandon see because that's the only way I'm going to get out of here amen see the reason that Jesus did not know his part is because it had not been revealed unto him right that's the reason the angel couldn't tell it it hadn't been it wasn't revealed it was the secret thing the Book of Revelations the sealed and things was sealed up I can't I just wish you would take what he said to you sometimes and study it I we should take what way preached there Wednesday that the Book of Revelation and the Book of Genesis shows identically the same thing that's but how many of you thought anything about it so far now listen you got to go from partial realization to perfect realization that's right now when the Lord Jesus Christ was here in Matthew 24 he preached six seals that's right you agree amen he preached them but nobody knew what he's talking about right that's right now some of the denominations cuz we did his Baptist we could understand enough to take the Matthew 24 what is it's a six seal anyway when it gets over to there and could see the tribulation well man we had it all goofed up had it all over the place and everything 7 years of it and all kind of things right but you know what I'm talking about cler Larin almost 100 years before brother brandom preached that the white horse rider was the Antichrist but you know he didn't know it that's just a good guess so you were not Tau like that wouldn't you tell me it wasn't the word had to come to the prophet right that's it amen it was sheld up until then right it was down in that pyramid and he ped the top off right the writing was down inside not outside where man could read it man could read the Bible up to the book of Jude and he can understand some things in the Book of Revelation but he couldn't get the real meaning of all of it I just ask you a good question I've asked you this many of times and preached on it many many many times before Moses got 10 commandments and wrote five books is that true right hey I know see I know how smart people are there's two quotes that brother around said Moses just wrote four books see I studi it all out before I bring but there's also two more around and said Moses wrote five books you say are you your as a contradiction no sir just a misstatement of a prophet how else could it be cuz he knew M just wrote five books where did he know of what happened in the garden the same way yeah that Jesus come to John that the lord gave a revelation to Jesus Christ to give to John on pap right the Lord Jesus preached six seals but no one knew what that was about no riters or anything could follow that and understand they had it all messed up why because the anointing that was on the Lord Jesus Christ to preach that left him in the Garden of Gethsemane that's right now that's according to what it's on number uh nine of your notes this rising of the sun said the spirit left him in the garden all right we turn on over number 10 says the manifested sons of God 1960 says the anointing left him in the garden but I like number 11 there where the Prophet said it a long time ago after the door of the Gentile church is closed God will anoint a church and God will do in one year what theologist has tried to do in 2000 right but I like the way he says said everybody he's doing it now right that's where people think there's nothing going on but they don't see things like this this is the way I see things and I'm sorry if that's the way I do it not sorry sorry for you we're promised an anointing to come to the church again in the end time right with the same Ministry of Jesus Christ y but I wish you would go down the line and read those things that I gave you they brother around him in 1954 on the message unconditional Covenant number 12 on your notes and read what he said that the same Ministry of Jesus Christ was right there in the church then right see I know that's what it says partial realization the same Ministry that the Lord Jesus Christ had cuz what happened in the garden to Gethsemane oh of course everybody can preach all about the river Jordans and all about these things but they can't get down in there and deal with it where it's really haing it that's right amen Y what fell on the day of Pentecost the faith of the fathers amen the faith of the fathers come on a de of Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost came on the 120 na room up to where you see where it says holy spirit on the pyramid and all these things were sealed in them but they didn't have the headstone that's what your Prophet said right that's on Daniel 70 weeks if you wanted there's plenty more be glad to get them for you but go on down look at the next Faith once delivered 1955 he delivered to his Apostles the same Ministry that he had are you reading them next one Jesus Christ is sign 56 205 that Jesus had the apostles to carry on the same Ministry that he [Applause] had now that didn't even talk about The Headstone is it right see that's why people don't understand why brother R would make a statement it's it's on down it's on the back page of this notes that you got here brother brandom where he says 3:27 let you'll see in church age this messenger of Malachi 4 and Luke 17:30 is going to do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father two reveal the seven Thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seal and it'll be these divinely reveal mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers I'm quoting it off the page there right cuz you see that Prophet had to turn the hearts of the children back that's right before you can talk about the SE right amen that's true see that's the ministry that Jesus Christ put in the church on the day of Pentecost the ministry of Jesus Christ that he had while he was on Earth but the headstone done left him in the garden right so it couldn't come on the day of Pentecost well give me a quote for that well quote rather forget it I ain't going to argue with you about it amen that's I Don't Preach too long I don't mean tonight I'm talking about all the years They carried it on look at the one where he saying uh the sign of the Messiah not number 15 on your notes he talking about that when you were here in the body of Flesh the ministry is here now he said like it was here when you was in the body of Flesh see brother random is telling you the ministry of Jesus Christ was on the day of Pentecost whose Ministry was it come on right and down Through the Ages it's been the ministry of Jesus Christ right right look on down to the next one number 16 322 paragraph 322 as I was with Moses 196 911 0911 morning service he said it's the same Ministry in a higher spear now we're going to change over a Ministry in a higher spear what do you mean brother brandom I mean Jesus Christ was here on the day of Pentecost and Jesus Christ has been the same yesterday today and forever mankind changed but the Holy Ghost has always been here in every age to give a new birth it was the word that was eat down it was not the holy ghost that was taken away that's why the Bible said the seven spirits of God your Prophet said that's a holy ghost in seven Church ages right he said the same Ministry look at number 17 Watchman what other night he's already speaking of something to come now cuz he just said it over here in a greater Spirit something fixing to happen now he begins to see it what does he see he says that the same light that went down is going to come back the same light that went down is going to come back and when it comes back it's going to come back with the same Ministry Jesus Christ so people can't look at around and see what's taking place at the ministry of Jesus Christ is here they're only looking for some kind of a headstone or some kind of a something they want to see the Great Signs and the Wonders and the things like that 1961 Abraham's Covenant confirmed E40 the same Ministry to shape up in the end time paragraph 63 of the same message it will come forth in full strength these are on the computer that people can read you read them yourself as I'm scanning down 1962 look as he's getting well let's see take it take on the whole armor 62 71 and he says he had it here he said other words is here he was getting ready you know what brother Brandon was doing you know why he was preaching on uh is this the sign of the end time service or whatever it was you know when he was saying I don't know what's going to take place but said it's either one thing he said I'm going off the scener that's going to step into something higher right he thought it was his death right but it wasn't his death it was to step into a greater ministry right we would see Jesus same thing he did here standing in the Gap 63 623 same Ministry that Jesus Christ did Y is here now he says modern events made clear by prophecy 65 the same Ministry in the bride and the groom the same Ministry there's where your headstone comes into being the ministry of Jesus Christ has been in the church don't miss that that's what I've tried my best to explain here to you and a lot of people said well brother Dell don't believe in manifestation there ain't nobody in the building believes in more manifestation than I do but there's one thing about it you can't make God do nothing you're only going to get yourself in trouble trying I've tried to explain adoption to you adoption is not the father going off the scene and the son coming on the scene that's what everybody thinks it is not it is the Sun going off the scene and Mak making his father manifest right Hallelujah getting rid of our nature and getting the nature of almighty God to come and live in us there's adoption amen amen that's right the father is coming on the scene let me ask you one question and I won't say another word on it either who did Jesus come to make known according to him he said he come to make the father known right well you know that's kind of all to do away with your thoughts about it that the father's going to go off the scene and the son come on the scene in such a great way look at me look at me look what I can do no no no no don't do that way just getting ourselves out of the way letting the father come on the S there's adoption amen that's right you say yeah but that way according to so and I don't care what so and so preaches I don't care what anybody preaches I preach what I believe they got a responsibility to preach what they believe but you know yourself that that hadn't changed in 40 years because I've always preached that to you that adoption is the son actually taking on himself the nature of the father until the father is one that gives him the signant the father has given all the responsibility it is not the son Jesus didn't come to make himself known he come to make the father known yeah brother Dale you no you you're wrong you say well brother D don't believe in manifestation I believe in the correct manifestation that's right because you haven't even never looked up the word manifest have you you ever looked it up the word manifest seems to be make known in the days of the manifestation of the sons of God what does that word mean means to make known y now maybe you forgot where we read while ago when we first started that this was not the revelation of Jesus but the revelation of Jesus Christ that's right that almighty God and bring his nature into a human mortal right that's right that's it make known see you make God known he'll make you known don't you worry about it amen but you make yourself known what do you got anointed ones look what I can do no you better get that out of your mind completely amen just look what he can do through me amen like I told you when I was walking around that store I wasn't thinking about nothing about anything about Lisa and didn't know anything about it and here he comes down it's not you it's him that's right sister Gail when he spoke to you there in your kitchen walking through there and said one God's correct was that you thinking wasn't even thinking about it wasn't even thinking about it all right I wrote notes to preach o seals that I preach in 82 and ' 83 off of a job that it took two men to run when I was out of work that's no joke these brothers can tell you it took two people to run my job man could not relieve me 16 minutes and keep my job Rob but I ran it and I wrote notes for the sermons of the seals off of a job that it cost that much that that two people that took them to run you see it's not you right and Jesus is not even trying to reveal himself he come to make known the father right have you ever heard brother Brandon I end it with this you ever heard brother brandom I'm talking about many many times when he'd be praying he' said father I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die for me Y how many times have you ever heard him say that amen yeah right how many other times you ever heard him thank the father for sending the son but how many times you ever read in the Bible where the son was trying to make your manifest all he could do was what God told him that's right he said you ask the father anything in my name and he'll give it to you Jesus made the father glorified am I quoting brother brandom adoption glorifies Jesus Christ right amen it don't glorify you and me right that's right yes but brother Dale brother so and so this makes me feel so good when I hear him preach you didn't enjoy it in the school when the first day they said I want to tell you something 1 + 1 = 2 right you went home you told Mama come on ministers I mean the musician come on minister to it don't matter so what' you do you went home to a Mama said Mama I know something what 1 + 1 = 2 you went back the next day and the teacher said now what's our lesson for today day 1 + 1 = 2 and for a whole week that's all she talked about and Illustrated and made drawings finally one day she said now let's get a little higher 2 + 2 is 4 you went home you said mama two plus two is four then for a week that's all you got you understand what I'm trying to illustrate I don't claim to be a teacher I'm just what I am in the body of Christ but I try to hold the same thing up before you and try to give you something to think about but you going to go home and say Brother D don't know what he's talking about cuz he's doing way with this he's doing away with that he's Trenary and he's this that of the other well come on let's hear you preach it right well brother Dale all I see was that all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ in the church well if you poured all of God into Christ and don't know what you're talking about then you just done away with God and you're headed to a Oneness Doctrine that's exactly right amen then you say oh Christ good he poured into the church well then you don't have no Christ no more all he got the church brother brother Brown said that over and over amen cuz he knew what he talking about that's right just like I said he knew what he's talking about when he'd pray he'd say father thank you for sending your son right but he would a trinitarian you knew what he's talking about that's right but you take partial realization and you understand the ministry of Jesus Christ is living in the church been in the church down Through the Ages that's the only way you can come out to see perfect realization in the end time amen when The Headstone comes that perfect realization can come become perfect Revelation this message got to be revealed to you it's not just going to going to church and being good we've done that 40 something years now folks lot of you was borned in that way that we've done it maybe were to do like they done the children of Israel you know what they' done before they crossed into the Promised Land you know they never circumcised one of their children while they were in the wilderness read your Bible right before they could cross into the promised land Joshua stopped and said hold it we got something to do they circumcised all of the men that were born in the way and a lot of them men was 20 30 years old 20 let's make it right just exactly 20 years old right they had to circumcise all of them before they could enter the promised land because he didn't circumcise any of them in the wilderness y amen how could he enter the promised land without circumcision the Bible's right read it listen to your Prophet let's go what do we

together and start talking people get offended because they think you're Turing up their Doctrine their idea but you see God said to the prophet the things I've read to you tonight that even Jesus didn't know his part that's right and that he couldn't do nothing until the father showed him where did Moses get what he wrote other five books of the Bible who told him that if it's any different in Revelations one then I've surely missed it it was a revelation that God give to Jesus Christ to give the ch the mystery that's father Love You Lord thank you I pray that what I've said tonight not the actions and reaction CU that's a human being and I'm sorry but it's so much that I try to illustrate it father that I get my own self tied up into it I know but also know that you're trying your best
