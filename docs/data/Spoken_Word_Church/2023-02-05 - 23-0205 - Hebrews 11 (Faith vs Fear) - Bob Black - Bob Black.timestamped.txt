[0:07] let's just give the Lord and pray Lord
[0:09] God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:10] gather together around your word I pray
[0:12] Lord as we look into your word and study
[0:13] these things out or you're quick in it
[0:15] to us Lord and help us Lord that our
[0:17] hearts will be prepared Lord for the
[0:19] word that we receive today I pray God
[0:20] that shall just be with brother Wade is
[0:22] he studying Lord Jesus granted Lord that
[0:23] you'll bless our services today in your
[0:25] name amen now we've been studying out
[0:29] Hebrews 11
[0:31] which is uh I I just uh a summation of
[0:37] all of the great things that God that
[0:40] God has done in people's lives they
[0:42] should build our faith to realize that
[0:44] if you believe that anything's possible
[0:47] and it starts off it says that faith is
[0:49] the substance of things hoped for the
[0:50] evidence of Things Not Seen
[0:53] you you when you've when you've got and
[0:56] brother Brown would explain that faith
[0:57] is a revelation
[0:58] that makes that means that faith when
[1:00] you've got when God speaks something to
[1:03] you it it uh goes beyond anything that
[1:07] that you can see or feel whether you're
[1:09] with your natural senses it trumps any
[1:12] any kind of circumstance because faith
[1:14] is is tied to God it's it's something
[1:17] Eternal when it's when you when you go
[1:20] beyond hope to to a living reality of
[1:23] the god of speaking to something to you
[1:25] now we're talking this morning about um
[1:27] faith is because faith is a revelation
[1:29] that goes with anything if you've got
[1:31] faith if God reveals to you the correct
[1:33] way to be baptized who who uh that that
[1:36] God is not three different people and
[1:38] you really have a real revelation of
[1:39] that it's a substance to you it's
[1:41] something that nobody's going to take
[1:43] away from you because of their of of
[1:44] reason or anything and it's not based
[1:46] upon the man's ideas or something but
[1:48] it's based upon God's word
[1:50] so all our if faith if our faith is
[1:53] based upon God's word then
[1:56] everything in a Christian's life
[1:58] everything everything the in the economy
[2:00] of God centers around the world that's
[2:01] why we come to church is because we want
[2:03] word we want the word we want to get fed
[2:06] because that's where we get our faith
[2:07] from faith is built upon the word it
[2:09] comes from hearing the word
[2:11] so the whole uh the whole system of God
[2:13] is based around the word so what what's
[2:15] what are you craving this morning you
[2:17] want some word uh somebody was coming in
[2:19] the door and we were standing at the
[2:21] door and there so I forget who it was
[2:22] but they said feed us this morning
[2:23] because we want that's what a Christian
[2:25] wants why because that's where that's
[2:27] where you get your faith from faith and
[2:30] the more word you hear the more word
[2:31] that you receive the more faith you get
[2:33] if you really open the door of your
[2:35] heart and and you allow God to come in
[2:37] and Quicken that to you it it produces
[2:39] something that is a substance
[2:41] that is the evidence of Things Not Seen
[2:45] now I mean we've got and Paul goes
[2:48] through the summary of all these all
[2:49] these uh great Hebrews of the faith that
[2:51] they subdue kingdoms and and we read
[2:52] this last time so I'll maybe just kind
[2:54] of go quickly over this slide but you
[2:57] look at this and you it I think that
[2:59] should just build our confidence that if
[3:01] these individuals did these things by
[3:04] their confidence in God's word and what
[3:06] should we be able to do by confidence in
[3:08] God's word see as you as you hear the
[3:11] word it actually produces a confidence
[3:13] in you where you start to trust God and
[3:15] you start to know God and you start to
[3:17] have confidence and if he said that he's
[3:18] going to bring it to pass and your faith
[3:20] begins to rise and it's rising that's
[3:22] that's what the stature of a perfect man
[3:24] is about that's what the that's what the
[3:26] third pull the opening of the word was
[3:28] to do is to build your faith that God
[3:30] would uh open the open the tear off the
[3:34] seals of the whole Bible so that you
[3:35] could have faith to believe that
[3:37] anything is possible to believe for a
[3:39] body change so brother man said in faith
[3:42] cometh by hearing he said God will look
[3:43] right down in your heart and see that
[3:45] almost faith in the promise that's
[3:47] that's kind of what we're talking about
[3:48] because when we when you look in the
[3:50] Bible it's it's a lot of promises so if
[3:53] you can believe that God made the
[3:54] promise and he's going to begin to pass
[3:56] then diseases will melt back from side
[3:58] to side cripples will walk blind we'll
[4:01] see death will hear dumb will speak why
[4:03] they have taken God at his word now
[4:07] there's a challenge for us this morning
[4:08] can we just take God at his word if God
[4:10] said it he's the one that made the
[4:12] promise
[4:13] my brother I'm said in the power of God
[4:15] he said what is it a revelation what is
[4:18] faith is God by the spirit revealing to
[4:21] you something that he's going to do or
[4:23] he's promised that should give us
[4:25] confidence this morning that if God
[4:27] really reveals something to you how to
[4:29] be baptized what who God is all these
[4:31] different things that we know if God's
[4:33] really revealed it to you then it wasn't
[4:34] something that a man taught to you he
[4:37] you it's taught in your mind at first
[4:39] but when God reveals it to you it come
[4:41] from God that's I I think sometimes we
[4:45] you know we well in Ephesians 4 11 and
[4:48] 12 says that God gave five gifts into
[4:50] the church Apostles prophets and so
[4:52] forth for the perfecting of the Saints
[4:54] that's that's for your perfecting but
[4:57] the perfecting brother Brown would say
[4:58] comes between you and God
[5:00] and see if we can get that really home
[5:02] down so that we're explaining it right
[5:04] when you're perfected it's a
[5:06] relationship between you and God that's
[5:08] God doing to you personally that's
[5:10] something that the minister won't do for
[5:12] you the minister gives you the word but
[5:14] it's up to you to believe it when you
[5:15] believe it then now there's a
[5:17] relationship between you and God God is
[5:19] the one that's given you the revelation
[5:21] he said now if you only hear Faith
[5:24] cometh by hearing but hearing is not
[5:25] Faith a loaf of bread is purchased for
[5:28] 25 cents but 25 cents is not the loaf of
[5:30] bread see here hearing only brings the
[5:33] word that produces Faith but faith is
[5:36] the substance of things hoped for the
[5:38] evidence of Things Not Seen then you see
[5:41] you hear the word god reveals it to you
[5:43] that it is the truth and by Spirit
[5:46] revealed truth confirms your faith to
[5:48] God
[5:49] then that's the the church that God
[5:52] built upon the rock that the gates of
[5:54] hell can't Prevail against it that's a
[5:57] promise too that the Gates of Hell
[5:59] cannot Prevail against a revelation
[6:01] because if you've got a revelation it's
[6:03] Eternal it's substance it's something
[6:05] that the devil can't attack the devil
[6:07] can't take it from you in perfect faith
[6:10] and when he was talking about Peter
[6:11] walking on the water he said Peter he
[6:13] was doing all right till he got scared
[6:15] the word told him he could walk on the
[6:16] water
[6:18] that's how a lot of us do we look in the
[6:19] Bible and it says you can be healed it
[6:21] says you can do whatever that it said
[6:23] that Peter could walk on the water he
[6:26] was scared first he thought it was a
[6:28] ghost and he said Lord if it be you bid
[6:30] me come to you on the water what he
[6:31] feared happened
[6:33] what he believed happened now look at
[6:36] that what you fear will happen what you
[6:39] believe will happen
[6:40] so let's not fear let's not be afraid
[6:42] and we don't have any reason to fear
[6:44] when we've got God's promises that we
[6:46] can look at it if God said it we don't
[6:48] have to be afraid when he believed he
[6:50] could walk he walked when he believed he
[6:53] got scared in his belief then his
[6:54] substance lifted he still professed his
[6:56] faith but he didn't have the substance
[6:59] the substance whenever right over top of
[7:02] that white cap and went right on to him
[7:04] see if he has the perfect Faith see but
[7:06] he didn't have it he thought he did he
[7:08] did it first he was willing to venture
[7:10] out why the Lord told me to do it it's
[7:13] got to happen
[7:14] so he just steps right down out of the
[7:16] boat and takes off he never thought
[7:18] about the waves how contrary to what
[7:20] they was he never got that in his mind
[7:23] and the second hand of the robe he said
[7:25] you don't look at the symptoms you look
[7:27] at the promise
[7:29] symptoms are one of the greatest
[7:30] hindrance God has to work with his
[7:32] symptoms
[7:33] you don't never go by your feelings
[7:36] Jesus never did say did you feel it he
[7:38] said did you believe it see where you
[7:40] get the thing all turned around it's
[7:42] your faith in his promise that does it
[7:45] like Elisha he wanted the promise and if
[7:48] Elijah said he could have it if he kept
[7:50] his eye on him he kept his eye on him
[7:53] you remember that story of Elijah how he
[7:55] followed he followed Elijah through
[7:56] three stages
[7:57] and I don't know if I could remember the
[8:00] school of the prophets the then the next
[8:01] phase and all over to the River Jordan
[8:03] the death and he followed him through
[8:05] three stages just like just like David
[8:08] went through three stages and Abraham
[8:09] went through three stages and you're
[8:11] going to go through three stages and he
[8:13] kept his eye on the prophet who who he
[8:15] knew he was going to take him through
[8:16] three stages until he saw the word come
[8:19] to pass
[8:20] because he was looking at the promise
[8:22] now see you and I are not looking at
[8:24] we're looking at the promise of God that
[8:26] God made that's why even when we when we
[8:29] listen to brother Brown and we're not
[8:30] even listening to the words of a man I'm
[8:32] gonna quote this um
[8:34] this is one of my favorite quotes or
[8:36] when brother Brown was preaching and
[8:38] looking to the Unseen God just took him
[8:40] over and began to speak through his lips
[8:42] and he said if you go back to that
[8:44] message you could hear him say this he
[8:45] said I'm the Lord that raised I'm
[8:46] talking about the promise that's where
[8:48] we have our confidence is in the promise
[8:50] that God made
[8:51] he said I'm the Lord that raised up
[8:53] Christ from the grave I'm the one that
[8:55] sent the Holy Ghost I'm the one that
[8:57] give the promise brother Branham has
[8:59] nothing to do in this he surrendered his
[9:01] life to me I'm using his Spirit I'm
[9:03] talking through his lips that's me I'm
[9:04] the Lord
[9:05] so we we have confidence and not the
[9:08] words of a man but we have confidence
[9:10] that God is the one that spoke God is
[9:12] the one that gave us this message God
[9:14] was the one that gave us the word and
[9:16] you see that's what built will build our
[9:18] faith up faith in what God Said
[9:22] brother Brown said in the power of God
[9:24] he said what is it a revelation what is
[9:25] faith is God by the spirit revealing to
[9:28] you something that he's going to do or
[9:30] he's promised
[9:31] now if you only hear Faith cometh by
[9:33] hearing but hearing is not Faith a loaf
[9:36] oh I already read that quote
[9:39] oops
[9:42] and the statue of a perfect man he said
[9:43] first there's got to be faith
[9:47] faith is the substance of things things
[9:48] hoped for it's you already have it when
[9:50] you have faith because it's revealed in
[9:52] faith Hebrews 11 see the evidence what
[9:55] is it what kind of an Evidence a holy
[9:58] evidence
[9:59] therefore when you say brother Branham I
[10:00] believe that God Is A Healer well if you
[10:03] believe that and then accept him as your
[10:05] healer and not lying but actually
[10:06] believing that by his stripes you are
[10:08] healed there's nothing going to turn you
[10:11] from it it's a subtle thing
[10:13] now you might have hope just keep
[10:15] dodging to this and Dodge into that but
[10:17] when you got faith you know it because
[10:20] it is the evidence you've already got it
[10:23] now a lot of times we'll get real
[10:25] emotional like when we're reading
[10:27] through all these stories in Hebrews 11
[10:28] there's a lot of places where somebody
[10:30] could get real emotional like for
[10:31] example Abraham when God told him to go
[10:34] take his son to the top of the mountain
[10:35] he could have got real emotional and
[10:36] said well that's my son he got real
[10:38] emotional and then it just wouldn't have
[10:40] worked he'd come down and say maybe
[10:42] explain to his wife or someone his
[10:44] church folks well it was my son and I
[10:48] you know how could God expect me to do
[10:50] that but you see we've got to take
[10:51] everything back to the word
[10:53] our emotion our motion doesn't matter
[10:55] our fear doesn't matter you got to take
[10:58] everything back to the word because
[10:59] that's what we're basing we're basing
[11:00] our confidence in
[11:02] brother random said and then faith is
[11:04] once delivered to the Saints he said
[11:05] this brother prayed for me and this one
[11:07] cast The Devil out and this one that and
[11:08] the other he said mental emotions can do
[11:10] that but when that real genuine faith
[11:12] that God spoke the truth is settled in
[11:15] the person's heart
[11:16] it's eternal
[11:17] feeling has nothing to do with it no
[11:20] more God said so then that faith is
[11:23] stable no matter what takes place how
[11:25] you feel whether you get sick or whether
[11:27] you do or not that has nothing to do
[11:29] with it it's that faith that was once
[11:31] delivered to the saints that they
[11:33] believe
[11:34] oh so many times where like you think
[11:36] about Rahab she could have got real
[11:38] emotional and said well how could
[11:39] somebody expect me to just have
[11:40] confidence in a little Scarlet uh ribbon
[11:44] and I hang out hang out in my window but
[11:46] emotion emotion has no place
[11:50] when the Seal of the Antichrist he said
[11:52] upon emotions you can't rely upon that
[11:54] although that's right that goes with it
[11:56] you got to get the real thing first I've
[11:58] seen people stand throw themselves back
[12:00] and forth and work themselves into a
[12:02] panic screaming to the top of their
[12:04] voice and walk through pits of fire
[12:05] without even touching it and deny there
[12:07] was such a thing as Jesus Christ so that
[12:10] doesn't mean anything I've seen them
[12:11] such frantic hollering Allah until they
[12:15] take a lance and running up through
[12:16] their chin and nose like this and pull
[12:18] it out it wouldn't even be a drop of
[12:19] blood come out
[12:21] certainly cut themselves in the flesh of
[12:24] the prophets when the in the Feast of
[12:25] the prophets when they're cutting the
[12:26] leaves that the young ladies sitting
[12:27] there cutting leaves and the man laid
[12:29] his arm out and take a saber and whack
[12:30] his arms like that wouldn't even bleed
[12:32] in such a frantic you get what I mean
[12:34] and see I got a picture of something I
[12:36] got off the internet if somebody
[12:37] actually walking through coals of fire
[12:39] and so you can get real emotion on the
[12:42] outside but now on the inside there's
[12:43] nothing there's no substance
[12:46] and that's why the the evidence the
[12:48] evidence is faith faith will produce an
[12:51] emotion faith will produce a reaction
[12:53] but look down on the inside do you
[12:55] really believe
[12:57] because that's and and and how are you
[12:59] going to really believe without the word
[13:00] that's why what we want this morning is
[13:03] the word because the word received in a
[13:06] heart in that good ground that Jesus
[13:08] talked about it's if the if the word is
[13:10] planned in the good ground of your heart
[13:11] it's going to produce
[13:15] then we get all feared and brother Brown
[13:17] said it's the scare that burns you you
[13:19] got the Holy Ghost that's operating in
[13:21] your body well when that old snake
[13:22] grabbed a hold of Paul's hand that was
[13:24] not a bit of scare he looked at it like
[13:27] that shook it off in the fire and went
[13:28] on and got some more sticks it didn't
[13:30] scare him see if you're not scared Jesus
[13:32] said well why did you fear Peter come
[13:34] walking on the water doing fine until
[13:36] he's seen the waves were contrary then
[13:38] he got scared and began to sink Jesus
[13:41] come picked him up said why did you fear
[13:43] oh ye of little faith fear you're scared
[13:45] it won't happen don't have one bit of
[13:48] fear move forward God said so that
[13:52] settles it now now we're saying all
[13:56] don't don't be emotional don't get
[13:58] caught up in emotional don't use fear
[14:00] don't don't be afraid but you know
[14:02] really what's going to take all that
[14:03] away what takes the fear away is the
[14:06] word of God
[14:07] the word of God is what settles
[14:09] everything and so as you receive in the
[14:11] word you have confidence in the word and
[14:13] begins to take the fear away you
[14:14] sometimes we come to church and we just
[14:16] want to we just want to work it up well
[14:17] I'm not going to be afraid but you you
[14:19] can't work it up in yourself how are you
[14:21] going to not be afraid the word of God
[14:23] received into your heart is what takes
[14:25] the fear it away
[14:27] in Luke chapter one you know when when
[14:30] when uh the angel gave Zechariah a
[14:33] promise that he was going to have his
[14:35] son John the Baptist and that he didn't
[14:36] believe so his his mouth was shut up uh
[14:39] when his mouth was finally opened right
[14:41] at the uh near the birth of John he
[14:43] began to prophesy and this is what he
[14:46] said this is part of what he said he
[14:48] began to speak about the promise that
[14:50] God had given and he said the oath which
[14:51] he swear to Our Father Abraham that he
[14:54] would Grant unto us that we being
[14:55] delivered out of the hand of our enemies
[14:57] might serve him without fear that's a
[15:00] promise that we've got that's that's why
[15:02] God sinned Jesus Christ on the earth to
[15:05] die for us so that he could give us back
[15:07] the holy ghost that you would have a
[15:09] revelation of who he really was and it
[15:10] would take the fear away and Holiness
[15:12] and righteousness before him all the
[15:14] days of our life
[15:16] so when we have faith real faith it gets
[15:19] rid of the fear real faith is substance
[15:22] where there's no it's not based on
[15:24] emotion it's not based on because you
[15:26] jumped around or ran up and down and
[15:27] screamed but there's something down on
[15:29] the inside that's confidence and what
[15:31] God Said that God said it so I know that
[15:35] God is able to perform it if God said I
[15:38] can be healed God is faithful to produce
[15:40] that if God said that somebody can get
[15:43] the Holy Ghost I'm going to get it
[15:45] that's where you start having faith
[15:48] faith in God's word
[15:50] so in the Bible it says where Paul speak
[15:53] of faith is the substance of things
[15:54] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[15:56] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[15:58] good report if you want to if you want
[15:59] to make God happy that's the only way to
[16:01] make God happy reading that's the only
[16:03] way to get a good report is to believe
[16:05] what he said to have faith in what he
[16:07] said
[16:08] through faith we understand that the
[16:10] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[16:13] that things which were seen were not
[16:15] made of things which do appear now see
[16:17] Paul's setting the stage for all these
[16:19] examples these Faith examples and he's
[16:22] starting off with saying through faith
[16:23] we understand that the worlds were
[16:26] framed by the word of God the word of
[16:29] God is so powerful that it could set the
[16:32] sun and the moon and the stars and all
[16:34] those things that the James Webb
[16:36] Telescope was unfolding all those things
[16:38] are hung in the heavens by the word of
[16:40] God so if the word of God can control
[16:42] the heavens what about your life if the
[16:45] word of God is powerful enough to
[16:47] control the Heavens to set the heavens
[16:49] in order and then what about the problem
[16:50] in your family what about the problems
[16:52] in the all the circumstances in your
[16:54] life if you have faith in the word of
[16:56] God that is able to set the worlds in
[16:59] order
[17:00] so that things which are seen were not
[17:02] made of things which do appear
[17:04] and the door of the heart brother Ram
[17:05] said I found a picture once that was
[17:08] well sorry let me go by to this because
[17:11] Hebrews 11 is is about the it's the Hall
[17:13] of Faith it's looking at all these
[17:15] examples of people that believed and and
[17:17] the impossible was accomplished in their
[17:19] life
[17:20] so brother Adam said in the door of the
[17:22] heart he said I found a picture once
[17:23] that was striking just can't think of
[17:25] the artist who painted the picture but
[17:26] it was of Christ knocking at the door
[17:28] and while he was knocking at the door he
[17:30] said all famous pictures first has to go
[17:33] through What's called the Hall of
[17:34] critics before it can go to the Hall of
[17:36] Fame that's a beautiful thought did you
[17:39] know all great things has to pass
[17:40] through the critics God's blessed church
[17:43] has to go through the critics and stand
[17:45] the criticism before it can be took to
[17:47] the hall of God's Immortal thing
[17:50] and the scripture says all that live
[17:52] Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[17:54] persecutions so if you're not persecuted
[17:56] for righteousness sake not something you
[17:58] brought on yourself but for
[18:00] righteousness Satan there's something
[18:02] wrong somewhere now why is that
[18:04] everybody's got to be examined your
[18:06] doctrine's got to be examined your faith
[18:09] has got to be examined you're going to
[18:10] have to go through situations in life
[18:11] just like these in Hebrews 11 because
[18:14] your faith has got to be proved out and
[18:16] God will set you through circumstances
[18:18] and things to test you and prove you
[18:19] just like Abraham and David and every
[18:22] other one of these Rahab to see to prove
[18:25] do you believe and so if that's if
[18:28] that's the case for these people that
[18:30] we're going to read about and that's the
[18:31] case for us I I want to I want to set in
[18:33] my mind to believe God's word because I
[18:36] want I want to be I want to be found
[18:38] faithful when I when the test comes he
[18:41] said every famous picture must first go
[18:43] through the Hall of critics before it
[18:44] can be hung in a Hall of Fame and I tell
[18:46] you that's what the church has done
[18:48] today is went through the critics but
[18:49] one of these mornings God's going to
[18:51] hang her in a Hall of Fame out here just
[18:53] as sure as the world
[18:55] that same church is going to be called
[18:57] up one of these mornings hung in the
[18:59] Hall of Fame as she cuts through the air
[19:01] Yonder
[19:02] and doors and door he said see it's like
[19:04] the church has to pass through the Hall
[19:06] of critics you're going to be called
[19:08] Holy Roller you're going to be called
[19:10] Everything But If You Could Only Hold
[19:12] Your Position in Christ and someday
[19:15] he'll take us to the Hall of Fame but
[19:17] first we've got to stand criticism there
[19:20] is where the littleness of us stand
[19:21] there is where it shows he that cannot
[19:24] stand chastisement is an illegitimate
[19:26] child and not a child of God no matter
[19:28] how much he's joined church and whatever
[19:30] he's done he is still if he cannot stand
[19:33] chastisement he's an illegitimate and
[19:36] he's not a real child of God but a real
[19:38] genuine child of God don't care what the
[19:41] world says everything else is secondary
[19:43] he's got his mind on Christ and that
[19:46] settles it now see that goes back to
[19:49] Hebrews 11 1 faith is the substance and
[19:52] if faith is based on the word that's all
[19:53] a Believer cares about not emotion not
[19:57] fear not all those other things not what
[19:59] the world cares about not what the the
[20:00] critics say about you at work or school
[20:03] you care about the word you care about
[20:05] pleasing God because that's the only
[20:07] thing that matters to you
[20:09] look he said whatever Christ says do
[20:11] he'll do it wherever the lamb goes
[20:14] they're with him wherever and then you
[20:15] see his appearing his presence and what
[20:17] he does he is always with his people his
[20:20] bride his courtinger
[20:22] mm-hmm
[20:24] and the revelation of Jesus Christ he
[20:26] said we get in it'll dig up the lives of
[20:28] the Great Men back there how they
[20:30] sacrificed
[20:31] you'll see how little you've done
[20:34] it makes me feel ashamed of myself
[20:36] sometimes how we have to have everything
[20:38] so easy and they had everything so hard
[20:41] wondered about Paul said in Hebrews 11
[20:43] and sheepskins and goat skins tormented
[20:46] and Afflicted destitute what will our
[20:48] testimony stand up beside of theirs how
[20:51] will it be up beside of that and we have
[20:53] to have everything so nice
[20:57] foreign
[20:58] so by faith Abel offered unto able a
[21:01] more excellent sacrifice than Cain
[21:04] by which he obtained witness that he was
[21:06] righteous
[21:08] God testifying of his gifts and by it he
[21:11] being dead yet speaketh
[21:13] Faith Abel had such a substance faith
[21:16] that he he was willing to he he was
[21:18] willing to forsake everything to do what
[21:20] God said he knew what it was that that
[21:23] he had he had to offer up a a lamb that
[21:26] it was blood he he it wasn't somebody
[21:29] something that he was taught or that he
[21:31] was educated into
[21:33] but it was something real to him that he
[21:35] knew the problem
[21:37] and brother I said in the ministry
[21:38] explained he said when Solomon's gift
[21:40] was recognized among the people that he
[21:42] was A Gifted Man that God was with
[21:43] Solomon everybody come from everywhere
[21:45] to see Solomon because he had a Divine
[21:48] gift that was in operation and it proved
[21:50] itself
[21:51] the Bible said God will testify of his
[21:54] gifts he always has he always will
[21:57] might be a lot of things said it wasn't
[21:59] right but God will testify of his gifts
[22:02] you don't believe the holy spirit is a
[22:04] gift of God let it come on you one time
[22:06] God will testify of his gifts
[22:09] God will testify of somebody that's got
[22:11] a real Revelation it's going to Bear
[22:13] forth fruit it's going to manifest
[22:15] itself
[22:18] and then it says by faith Enoch was
[22:20] translated that he should not see death
[22:22] and was not found because God had
[22:24] translated him for before his
[22:26] translation he had this testimony that
[22:28] he pleased God
[22:29] but without faith it is impossible to
[22:32] please him for he that cometh to God
[22:33] must believe that he is and that he is a
[22:36] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[22:38] Him and we're going to end on this but
[22:40] you think about what brother Brown said
[22:41] that at the end of the road Enoch turned
[22:43] back and he said I've done everything
[22:45] that you require me to do and everything
[22:47] that God required him to do he did by
[22:49] faith now you think about that you can
[22:52] look back through your life and say that
[22:53] I've done everything when you come to
[22:55] the end of the journey if if you truly
[22:57] have and you can say that you asked me
[22:59] to go down into the water and be
[23:01] baptized and I did it by faith you told
[23:03] me I needed to be born again and I did
[23:05] it by faith you told me I needed to grow
[23:07] up on the stature of a perfect man and I
[23:09] I read and I understood the quotes and
[23:11] the Word was revealed to me and I did it
[23:13] by faith and you can say well I like
[23:16] Enoch could look back in his life I've
[23:18] done everything that you require to me
[23:19] when you can say that that word has been
[23:21] opened up and we're adopted and you know
[23:24] whether or not that is true in your life
[23:26] it's got to be true to somebody
[23:28] somebody's got a somebody's got to look
[23:30] back and say I've done everything that
[23:32] you required we've eaten the we've eaten
[23:34] the body word of Christ and we've eaten
[23:36] it until until we've come to a faith and
[23:39] but by faith that's the only way that
[23:41] you can please God Is by Faith by faith
[23:43] in his word his word is what is
[23:45] transforming us his word is what is
[23:46] giving us power his word is giving us
[23:49] overcoming power again against the devil
[23:51] and if you come to God you've got to
[23:54] believe that he is and that he is a
[23:56] rewarder of them that but trust in his
[23:58] word and Trust in his word
[24:01] and believe believe in his word because
[24:03] his faith faith is trusting what God
[24:06] Said
[24:07] and we'll stop right there
[24:22] foreign
