========================================

God bless you and good morning let's just bow our head and go into the study Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning and we know your word promises that we're two and threes are are gathered together in your name you'd be with our midst Lord Jesus and we just ask Lord that you'll feel at Liberty to be here today Lord we invite you in Lord God and I pray God that you'll just bless brother the waight as he's preparing and studying Lord open our the eyes of our heart to understand as we walk through the scriptures this morning Lord grant it Lord that you'll give us understanding we pray in your name so um I just wanted to thought I'd kind of uh sit on uh conscience a little bit more this morning I I got some feedback you know sometimes you you'll listen You'll read a scripture and you'll study something out and you realize you still don't understand it you know sometime I think that's one of the greatest blessings that when when you look at something and you realize there's still something like so um so I got some feedback from that um and you know I think it' be helpful to just kind of go over a little bit more and think about what a con what your conscience is but let's um so let's let's set the stage what what is your conscience when you're not born again God gives you that little voice down inside of your heart to be you you shouldn't eat those cookies or whatever but now with then when you're born it's like a stop light we looked at last time that it says you still don't don't do that don't step in the road don't you shouldn't be going in that direction but now when you're born again now God begins he's is like a supernatural stoplight now you you're now you know you shouldn't be committing adultery you shouldn't be doing things and and and uh it's and it begins to draw you to the word and the more the word you eat the more your conscience begins aligned it's like your conscience is is understand and I'll give you an example some people they're born again Christians and this is what PA addrress would say well I I'm not going to eat meat that was offered to an idol but others that wouldn't bother their conscience you see as you're eating the word it changes your perception of what's okay and what's not some people will put up a Christmas tree others won't even put a wreath up on their front door but you're not going to dechristianize one or the other see your conscience is beginning to be molded as it more the more words you eat it changes the way that you think about things now the main thing though is when your conscience says don't do it you better listen to it and and so so I'm going to go through some quotes and some some statements that were made the first one um I got a little example here of of polycarp being martyred and and brother brandom used this I think it was the church age book or where where he used this as an example of dying with a free conscience now you think how easy it would be somebody said well well just deny deny what you you believe it and just sign on the dotted line that you reject the the Protestant ideas and just take the Catholic Doctrine and and just go on with your normal life but polycarp's listening to his conscience he his conscience is telling him that what I believe matters and and so that's why it's so it's so it's important to listen to your conscience because your conscience will align you with the principles of the word and it will steer you in life to your Eternal destination so brother R said polycart was Marty too old to flee and too sincere a man to allow another to hide him and then suffer a penalty for doing so he gave himself up to death but before he did he asked for and was granted permission to pray two hours for his Brethren and the Lord for the governor for his enemies and his captors oh there's a there's a clear conscience when you're praying for the people that are about to burn you at the Stak like the great Saints of of all ages and Desiring a better Resurrection he stood firm refusing to deny the Lord and died with a free conscience now one of my favorite stories about having a free conscience is that story of Thomas Cromwell who was the Archbishop of Canterbury and they they gave him that same Choice sign away everything you believe in and he did he said you know what I'm I'm going to go give my rights and every and whatnot I'm I'm going to say that the Catholic Doctrine is correct and he signed it away and they said well you can go and live and and be happy but his conscience started bothering him because he knew what he believed was right and he signing that document was was going against his conscience what he knew was correct so we got that famous story of why when they burned him at the Stak he put his right hand into the flame and said this is the hand that hath offended the hand that signed that that document that said that he was going uh that that the Catholic Doctrine was right now Thomas aquinus said and I've got a scripture here to compare with what he said he said a man is bound according to his conscience even when it is in error because the Judgment of conscience is the Judgment of what he knows to be God's will so and I'll read the scripture here in a moment but now if you don't believe it's right to put up a Christmas tree and you boo It Anyway then you're acting in sin because you don't believe it and see what you're doing if you don't believe it's right to eat meat back in the Old Testament to eat meat offered to an idol and you do it anyway and you don't believe it's right now what kind of a situation do you have yourself in you're violating your own conscience you don't believe it's right but you're doing it anyway and that's what James 4:17 says if anyone then knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it it is sin for them if you know if you know and believe that you should should or should not do something but but you do it or do not do it anyway then you're violating your conscience and Thomas aquinus will go on to say I'm just I'm just got a few statements that he said he said conscience is an act not a power it is an act of applying knowledge to something done as when one says I have a clear conscience that is because I know that I have not done anything wrong now now you can see now get the difference there in your soul God gives you that stoplight to know what to do but that in your spirit real we've got that label conscience because in your spirit realm you're battling you're battling over it's it's like brother R said the constellation of the solar the stun down at the uh the sun in the center and all the planets of your memories and Consciousness affection imagination around that God is aligning with that that truth in your soul he's aligning it so that you're C the way that you look at things the way that you reason things aligns with the Holy Ghost in your soul the battle though the battle is in your Spirit realm that conscience what what is right what is am I am I doing what's right or not and you battle it out and the only way that you'll really know what's right or not is to feed on the word until your whole being begins to align with the word amen that's why Hebrews 13:17 says obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you pray for us for We Trust we have a good conscience and all things willing to live honestly now if you want to just kind of sum up what that means in plain language obey and submit to your spiritual leaders who are accountable to God for Watching Over The Souls of their congregation Christians should make their leaders task a joyful one not a burdensome one and pray for your spiritual leaders who strive to maintain a clear conscience and conduct themselves honorably in all aspects of life and Ministry so what's your conscience that that stoplight that says go or or don't don't you can go or you can't and it's there when you're not born again and it's there when you're born again and it keeps growing in maturity to know so that you know what you're here for and what your purpose is and how to approach situations and it turned well see I'm kind of jumping forward in our notes as you begin to get grow in maturity and understanding the word that you read actually becomes your Navigator and it helps you navigate situations that's why it says in the the Scripture it says he will lead you and guide you into all truth he gives you a guide to navigate things and to say you can't go here and you can go here and so forth and so on that's why brother R said and what think you of Christ he said well then you wait over that and next thing you know wait over that stoplight you pass by the church you hear the hymns you hear the preaching every red light God flashes before you you just break the barriers down and go right right on don't pay any attention to conscience or nothing else then did God send a person to hell no you sent yourself that's right you went on your own accord God throws every red light in front of you he could and you just keep moving right on headl long you determined to do it then he said now there's a red light hanging down here in the city if you run through that red light the city's not responsible for you you did it on your own will that's right so then God has done everything that he can to keep people and to bring them to him and love them now you can see that even the church and everything the battle the battle with that conscience you'll see somebody battling over they'll come and maybe they've been here for years and they come and they they the shirt skirt starts getting a little bit shorter and they they maybe they start trimming their hair off and you're wonder what's going on you know it's that that conscience are you listening to your conscience your conscience down inside of you is telling you you need to conform to the word and you stop listening to it and it starts causing problems stay right with the conscience because God it's a gift from God if we'll listen to it and heed it it will guide us all through life guide us through every challenge of life oh like like the like that I love quoting that scripture in Malachi 3 that says if you pay your tithe then you've got that promise that he will rebuke the devour and so when the devour comes when the boss starts firing people and whatnot you still got that promise I I've been doing what you my I've been doing what according to what my conscience tells me to do and now I can lay claim to that promise that the devour will be rebuked and everything about a Christian Life is is lined up with your obeying your conscience even when we come to church and we and we you when your baptized we use that example it's a is is representative of having a clear conscience and when you take communion you take the the bread and the and the wine you take it having a clear conscience and you know there's a simple remedy for having not having a clear conscience I I I'm just going to go on little tangents here for a little bit I I don't know why we sometimes battle so much over not taking communion when there's a simple remedy over not having a clear conscience if you've got all against your brother then go pray about it before the service you don't have to come here and sit and look and look at one another and say well I can't take communion for the next 6 months or whatever I take get it get it right get it taken care of go to somebody and apologize and humble yourself and say I'm sorry and then go on and and and and and take care and you see on the flip side you'll have you'll have those that don't care anything about the gospel they just they're not there for they're just kind of there because somebody dragged them to church and they don't want nothing to do with them they go home and and look at things online that they shouldn't have and you know their heart's not in it they're ain't dressing right they ain't doing right they ain't living right and it's all apparent but yet their conscience doesn't condemn them and they'll free to take communion so you got there's a there's a there's a right if will listen to our conscience and let it line us up with the word it will guide us and steer us right amen God's done everything that he can to keep people and bring them to him and love them and love them so what is your conscience the soul the conscience that once condemned you isn't there anymore he's given an example I'm just reading some different quotes to tell you what this the conscience is your soul your soul is your conscience and if you don't listen to it he said it'll a somebody that's not regenerated that last quote there you you keep pushing it down pushing it down until they're there're at the end in the days back there where they wouldn't give morphine uh it'll come up and you realize that there's something wrong with that Soul down on the inside that you hadn't been listening to listen to your conscience your inner conscience speaks louder than your mouth does and what does it say my brother I will give this example of the little boy sneaking behind the barn rolling up corn silk and smoking it now we probably all had different experiences like that going out the in the in the in the backyard and getting up to no good or whatever and you got that little voice that tells you don't do this little boy that's wrong don't do that and and and he uses that example of how his wife would say and I've got this picture this is called nomin nominal nominal uh Christianity or you're just doing it in name only and and it's just like uh seems like all of America's Gotten Trapped with this because they got an American flag waving behind them or they and they go to Dollywood and listen to some Christian singers or whatever they say I'm a Christian but that ain't got nothing to do with Christianity and brother Rand would use that example is his wife looking at the Finnish people they go to church why are they acting like why you know Americans that go to church why why can they get away with these things but I can't and he said why those people go to church and I've often wondered why it didn't condemn their conscience I said my dear wife let me tell you they are Americans what what does your conscience say see that's that's the main thing it are we listening to our conscience I was talking to Zach about a a situation where a young young man up there in North Carolina come out out out of a church that had got into all kinds of things and all sorts of doctrinal things and you know uh looking at it had a wonderful testimony because there's so many people that get caught up in things and they start looking at other uh false Doctrine and things and they begin to Come Away with the idea that the message is wrong well this young man came away with the idea that there's some people that just ain't living it and you know I think that's one of the greatest there's some one of the greatest Revelations is that there's there's the the gospel is true other people just sometimes don't live it my conscience will that make me act in a way that other PE different from the way that other people are and you just got to keep going right on with the straightened error don't look at other people just look at what your conscience is telling you to do because your conscience is what will lead and guide you it in Hebrews chapter 10:2 says for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purred should have had no more conscience of sin so that's what happens when you're when you're born of the Holy Ghost and you're conscience is purged and cleaned up so that you don't have any desire you're don't there's no more desire for the things of the world your conscience has been changed you don't want to dress like the world anymore you don't want to do those things anymore you don't want to look at those things anymore you you've been changed and John 16:13 says how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come now that makes your conscience a holy ghost filled believer's conscience like your guide through the Maze of life that when you get into obstacles like you get into a place at work I I'm sure we've all seen where where people that don't have a conscience at work they'll just step over somebody and mow down other people they don't care they don't care about stealing something they don't care about those things and they'll just roll right on through because they're ignoring every stoplight and many times it seems like the Christian gets taken advantage of but a real Christian's got the stoplight in them because it's it's worth more than your life to obey your conscience like polycarp they burn me at the Stak it don't matter I'm doing what God told me to do now see that's that's more valuable than silver and gold and everything else if you obey your conscience down on the inside that tells you how to navigate situations and how to navigate life and where to go and how to treat others see see your the word becomes the way that you navigate things like for example do unto others as you would have them do unto you when you come to a scenario then you look at the word and the word will actually guide you how to how to how to approach it but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 says but God God ha revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things ye the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him how are you going to know what's in a man's heart unless you've got his Spirit well that's how you know the things that are in God's heart is have the same spirit and and if you listen to that it will teach you the word it will show you the word it will show you it it will be a a a guide through every situation in life even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God now that's that's what your conscience is and so Hebrews 13: 20:22 says now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever now see how that that you think maybe that doesn't tie into what we're talking about but it does tie in because a little baby don't know what's how to navigate the a maze but as it keeps learning and keeps being taught the the conscience begins to mature until it knows how react in different situations and what's happening is our conscience our the way that we the way that we look at things is changing and maturity until we're we're matured into a perfect a perfect man which is Christ Christ veiled in us to to act and react and look at things just like Christ does make you perfect in every good work and that's what the the Mandate there in Ephesians 4:11 to the five-fold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ there's what Perfection is is completeness where God can take us and mold us so that we're we're trusting in that little uh like in the St in the uh statute of perfect man sermon brother Brown said it they they listen to that little little nod what where's that nod coming from from your conscience when you get that little that little prod or prick down in your heart to do like Phillip go talk to the Ethiopian unit go go over go turn aside and go to this little church over here speak on these things when you're ministering the little nod that kind of nudges your conscience your conscience is your guide and Thomas aquinus was I've got this little the little our our our stature of a man chart here as a as a comparison and Thomas aquinus would say conscience is the application of knowledge to action all this knowledge is packed in now what do I do with it I'm battling it out should I is is this right is it wrong but when it's packed in and you know what's right there your conscience is becoming subject to the word of God conscience is the application of knowledge to to action a judgment of reason whereby the human person person recognizes the moral quality of a concrete act and brother well well I've got this is a quote from Brother brown but Perfection is the condition state or quality of being free or as free as possible from all flaws or defects it implies completeness and a state of being without any limitations or defects and that's what Paul is aduring us to come to there at the end of Hebrews 13 to Perfection so he says as we're about to close Hebrews 13 He says and I beseech you Brethren suffer the word of exhortation for I have written a letter unto you and few words know ye that our brother Timothy has set at Liberty with whom if he comes shortly I will see you salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints they of Italy Salute You Grace be with you all amen now if we're going to look real quick in the last couple of minutes at a summary of Hebrews 13 just to kind of remember all these things that we've been studying over for the last year or so show uh well the last few months for Hebrews 13 show love and Hospitality to one another and strangers Paul told us to remember those who are imprisoned or mistreated to honor marriage and to avoid sexual immorality he told us there in verses 5 and six we're warned against the love of money and encourage to be content and God promised that he would never leave us or forsake us in verse 7 he said remember and imitate the faith of our spiritual leaders considering the outcome of their way of life now isn't that something that the spiritual leaders are supposed to model Christianity so you look at them and say well I want to I want to be an overcomer like that and that's how we should live our lives and Paul emphasizes the unchanging nature of Jesus Christ and warned against being Carried Away by strange teachings and he said in verse 10 and 14 to 14 Christians must bear the reproach of Christ because we're seeking a Heavenly city rather than an Earthly one thank God this ain't my home we're going somewhere Christians sacrifice themselves in verses 15 to 16 including the sacrifice of praise to God continually doing God and sharing doing good and sharing with others everything about your Christian Journey is a sacrifice you sacrifice to come to church today you sacrifice when you get up and and and and and do good and pray and and lay aside time to study your Bible it's all a sacrifice and verse 17 we're called to obey and submit to our spiritual leaders as they keep watch over our souls so if you want to look at the whole book of Hebrews again Hebrews told us that Jesus is God and it told us that there's a new covenant that Christ come to establish and it stressed that that faith and perseverance and the face of Trials and hardships are critical and he showed us examples of Old Testament Hebrews there in Hebrews 11 who demonstrated faith and endured suffering Paul told us not to fall away from the faith but to keep on running like a race that you trying to get to the end cross the finish line keep on and don't give up and he compared the Earthly Tabernacle with the Heavenly Sanctuary where Christ serves as our high priest and he the fin final chapters offered practical advice for Christian Living including Brotherly Love Hospitality caring for others and submitting to our spiritual leaders if you want to find some good scriptures just call out Hebrews 1 and 1 1 to3 said God who at sunry times and in diverse manner spake in time passed under the fathers by the prophets and Hebrews 4 said the word is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and Hebrews 4:14 to6 says says seeing them we've got a high priest that is passed into the heavens so let us hold fast our profession we got a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmity so don't give up hold fast to that one that's going to come on the scene when you need it Hebrews 6 1920 says we've got which we we've got an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and that which entereth into that within the veil whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made in high priest Forever After after the order of melkisedek and Hebrews 11 said now Faith is the substance of things hoped for as the musicians go ahead and come forward without faith it is impossible to please him and Hebrews 12 we're accompass about with so great a cloud of witnesses Hebrews 12 told us that no chastening for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievous and Hebrews 13 told us let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with what you got and he closed Grace be with you all amen God bless you Saints [Applause] [Music]
