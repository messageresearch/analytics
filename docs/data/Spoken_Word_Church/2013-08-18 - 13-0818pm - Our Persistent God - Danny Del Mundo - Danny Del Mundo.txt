TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of my heart I want to see you see climbing shining Glory Glory of your glory Glory Glory Glory over here amen amen amen thank you Lord amen so we just go straight to the reading of the word amen so let's just open our Bible in John chapter 10 another familiar scriptures amen we're so much familiar with the word because we have been part of this word Hallelujah let's start leading from verse 27 it says here my ship hear my voice and I know them right those he did for no right he did predestination amen and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish Hallelujah so how can something that has never begin and will never end perish Hallelujah so when I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand Hallelujah other people thought it's another hand amen so I don't believe the father has another hand from the Sun because it's the same hand all throughout hallelujah amen so when I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall anyone pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand and he said I and my father are one amen hallelujah and that's what I believe because that's what the word said Hallelujah no matter how they try to justify three persons two persons amen I believe there is one God and there is only one personality of God Amen so uh and may God continue to add blessing to his word once again let's bore heads in prayer and that's his inspiration and Lord Jesus we thank you so much this afternoon We Believe Lord that you are the word and not only that Lord you are the author and that's why you are the one that we are approaching this afternoon with a humble Heart Lord and if there is anything wrong that you have found in US Lord Jesus you just Hallelujah through your blood by your blood Amen Let It Be Hallelujah annihilated from your mind and as you promised Lord you have thrown all this transgressions in your sea of forgetfulness oh God as we approach your word once again may you continue to bless us spiritually in Jesus Christ's name everybody say amen amen hallelujah and God bless you you may be seated amen so that's what we believe amen I uh he he is our cheap Shepherd and we are the ship and that's why we don't follow any other voice because we recognize his voice amen and uh that's why we have we have today the Fulfillment of Revelation chapter 10 verse 7 but in the days of The Voice Hallelujah so uh so with the simple thought this afternoon I want to speak about persistence so brother branham's uh brother Branham spoke one time or many times he he spoke about perseverance right so I believe it's also an attitude it's also a character of God by being perseverant amen he's he persevered in the with the same principle and with the same inspiration amen we should have that kind of uh attitude Hallelujah so in the message perseverance let me start with this statement in paragraph 24 but the Bannon defined perseverance he said I would like to take a text from this use one word and that word is perseverant and that was the title of that message and the word perseverance means to be persistent Webster says that it is persistent in making a goal trying to do something and being persistent about it you become perseverant Hallelujah so we we uh we serve a purpose and we know what the purpose of our existence is so men of all ages who has faith in what they are trying to achieve has been perseverant you must have faith in what you are doing amen so praise the Lord so uh brother random quoted this uh this statement when he preached about perseverance and uh he used the text in Matthew chapter 15 we're not going to read that let me just uh rephrase it and it is it is about the woman which we who we made mention this morning you know that her daughter was hugely seriously vexed with a certain sickness and she was you know pleading for the Lord and uh he she addressed uh the Lord with a title that was not applicable in that day amen and she said uh son of David amen but somehow in the process because uh the woman had had a certain character and attitude a persevering uh attitude and so the Lord was so pleased amen and uh uh you know it takes a genuine character to be perseverant to be persistent in in what you do and and uh to be perseverant is uh not just trying to do something and uh be disappointed the first time the second time third time or even more amen so uh to to to apply the principle of of being perseverant is to you know probably be this up disappointed be upset somehow a number of times okay but you push through with it so that's like that's what brother Benham said men of all ages who has faith in what they're trying to achieve has been perseverance so I believe because amen because this woman amen this woman so loved her daughter and you know uh that kind of love put him in a desperate condition amen and that that is a a a a desperate and and it's Faith amen that she believed and that even in a certain you know even if she was given a little opportunity he's going to take that opportunity amen so you know uh uh she had no other option you know when she was rejected the very first time she had no other option you know she didn't have to go to another church another another Minister because she had no other option she believed that the the need she had at that very time only the Lord could give it and so she had no other option but the Lord Jesus cried and so she followed through amen and he said it's not meat you know to uh to to give the the children's bread to a dog amen and what an address you know and you know uh Gentiles at that time were considered as dogs they were nothing Hallelujah but somehow you know uh uh this woman said you know uh uh yep dogs even eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table even he said she did not uh uh refuse to be called dog she did not reacted wildly being addressed with that kind of uh name you know and be considered a dog and she said truth Lord Hallelujah but even dogs amen even dogs and you know uh dogs actually don't eat crumbs it's the puppy so she was so little to be called dog but even then she made herself a little more amen and that really caught the Lord Jesus Christ amen and and and and and Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith Hallelujah great is thy faith Hallelujah and her daughter was made hul from that very hour Hallelujah so that that is some kind of a persevering character and that was attributed to that woman right but this afternoon I would like to uh to to to to approach perseverance from another angle and this is not the woman because the woman always typed the church right and uh we of course we have that kind of attitude but somehow uh we have to see here that in our need amen it is not only us who are so perseverant who are so persistent and so that's why I would like to talk about our persistent God this afternoon amen so it's not me it's not you but it is God who is persistent Hallelujah so this is about our persistent God so he said in in verse 27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me amen so you see the the uh the the the the point here the bottom line here is that he knows me he knows who I am Hallelujah and that is what really counts because he knew us not only the moment we baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not the moment we heard this message but even before Hallelujah the foundation of the world he knew me right right and because he knew me amen he knows what he's going to do amen uh that in that way you know I I will hear his voice I will hear his message and I will react unto them into it amen and I will follow his voice you know uh the Lord did not you know the lion did not come here to be the lamb and say uh brother Branham said oh maybe I have to die at the cross and probably they will pity me and they will believe me no he came down here amen for a purpose okay and just like that that parable of that the Good Samaritan you know there was a man who came down from Jerusalem to Jericho amen so this man he was robbed you know and and he was abused but this man was not born in Jericho right he came down from Jerusalem to Jericho amen and that Good Samaritan who came down also came where he was amen and so we came from we there's a coming New Jerusalem but actually that New Jerusalem is the same Jerusalem where we were amen and so by somebody who who come from that place amen I come from the father I go back to the father Hallelujah so if I did not come from that there's no way for me to go back Hallelujah anybody did not come from that place then there must be no reason for him to go down right amen and so all this thought we believe amen have been uh clarified to us through the message of the hour amen he said I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to plug them out of my father's hand I believe this is the same hand Hallelujah there is no other hand but it's the same hand Hallelujah so you see now uh that's why in the church ages we have you know the the the the son of man you know we know the Lord Jesus Christ amen he is walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks right and so in his right hand there are seven stars Hallelujah so in order to be in the hand of the Lord we must be identified with one of those Stars Hallelujah because uh these Seven stars are in his hand so if we are identified to any of those Seven Stars then we are in his hand right and because we are identified and I believe we're only fulfilling scriptures in this generation so I believe we are identified with that seven star Hallelujah the reason why I live in this generation the reason why we live in this generation is because we are identified with that seven star and so because we are in that right hand of the Lord amen so because we're being identified then there's no way nobody can pluck us out of his hand as long as we are identified with the message of the Seven Star Hallelujah Where We Belong amen so no one nobody can discredit you nobody can take you out Hallelujah nobody can disregard what you're doing for the glory of the Lord amen as long as we stand on the message as long as we believe and believe what this message is telling us hallelujah so we are being identified with that star amen that have been sent in this generation Hallelujah so in that way you know there's nothing we can do about it you know sometimes if we are the only one who's holding the hand of the Lord you know we get tired you know the depression the uh if you look at this what's happening to the message people who used to believe this message and now they disbelieve the message before they were promoting this cloud and they now they disbelieve the cloud amen you get tired amen so if you're the only one holding the hand of the Lord you can lose your grip amen so that's why he did not say whoever hold my hand he said amen neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand amen so if we are apart if we are predestinated if we were uh uh uh among those whom he did for new for new amen he did for no then there's no way we can get out of his hand I may lose grip I may have lose the grip or somebody may have lose the grip but he kept on holding me Hallelujah he kept on holding me Hallelujah so even if I lose the grip but he held my hand and nobody can take me out of his hand Hallelujah so that's why amen so I believe this is the same thing why you know I I remember when you know when he was in front of the tumoblazarus amen and uh you know a lot of a lot of things have happened you know he did not come while Lazarus had uh had had probably a fever and the the situation get worse and worse and worse and then he uh he died and he had they had their funeral and and and and and and and they passed you know probably Jesus was there just watching and they brought him to the cemetery amen and then later on Jesus came Hallelujah it was done for a purpose amen because something to take place that the Lord will be glorified Hallelujah and so when he you know when he when he asked where he's where is Lazarus and then he asked the the women to push the Rock and I could imagine some other people who were just watching and say look at this man you know there are many men here and how come he he asked the women to push the Rock they're weaker vessels he said and they and now there he is asking them to push the Rock Amen but somebody had to respond to the word right and these women you know they were in the right place at the right time amen and when they heard the voice amen they just obeyed the word amen because somebody must hurt hear and obey the word amen and it can in it and it is it is being done then something has to take place Hallelujah so uh the women posed The Rock amen and so the the cave opened up and then you know Jesus called the name of Lazarus and because he is the resurrection he had to be accurate he had to name Lazarus otherwise everybody brother Branham said everybody uh uh in that uh Sepulcher you know we will live again you know they will rise from the dead so he had to call Lazarus amen and so he said Lazarus he named the he named Lazarus amen come forth and that voice echoed you know everybody heard the voice amen and that sound that voice came into that cave and it kept on echoing amen and and and and and the word said God said my word will not return unto me void so if that voice called Lazarus amen that voice must reach Lazarus wherever he is amen so that the word will come back amen and it has amen it will not be in vain amen Lazarus must come amen and so you know uh that that boy is echoed in that cave you know and then but but the but the body was lifeless amen and that body which is which was lifeless you know but but the word will not come in Back to the Lord in vain and so when that voice amen kept on the echoing in this Dimension it had to go into another dimension Hallelujah it has to go into another dimension and I would imagine you know Allah has been comforted by Abraham in another dimension and then and you know they had good Fellowship he was being comforted amen but but suddenly there was a voice amen and Lazarus said I heard that voice and I recognized that voice that's the voice of my pastor Hallelujah Abraham I enjoyed the fellowship I'm fully fully much comforted but I had to say goodbye for a while because I need to obey The Voice Hallelujah he named me and I need to go back Hallelujah so he came back to this Dimension Hallelujah in Lazarus came back to life Hallelujah so the boys amen the word will not return unto him void so I believe the same thing today the message of the hour keep on echoing and occuring and echoing Hallelujah so that the seeds that have been predestinated but the Venom said when God created the seeds were already there amen the seats were already dead they have they they they only needed something amen that they must be called amen and then suddenly they they grow and mature and bear fruits and all this thing amen according to God's perfect time so that what have happened Amen to each and every one of us we came from different uh you know uh lodges various denominations amen various cemeteries amen but there's a message so I believe this message will keep on echoing amen until that last predestinated scene amen will go back into the glory amen I'm sorry so you see so the the uh my ship hear my voice and I know them amen and so you see uh so now in here we we have to identify Lazarus was dead he was in another dimension but that voice that word was perseverant right persistent amen enriching as far as going Beyond another dimension to bring Lazarus back to prove that his word has power amen so uh that's why I remember you know Edison you know brother Branham said man of all ages amen they're trying to achieve they have to be perseverance so one time Thomas Alba Edison you know here we have these lights amen but it that it didn't happen overnight right amen so when he was you know when he was a uh trying to do to achieve what he had in his mind in his thoughts we he know he it is real but he he was he he started to figure out and do something you know and so when when uh when he became successful and he was interviewed and one of the reporters asked him uh okay Mr Edison because they know he said how how does it feel to fail 1000 times before becoming successful how does it feel one of the reporters how does it feel to fail a thousand times before you became successful and you know Edison replied I did not fail 1000 times he said the light bulb in fact was an invention with a thousand steps so to other people they say he failed a thousand a thousand times but for him who's doing the job it only took him a thousand steps amen so because because of that positive attitude brought him into a persevering character to achieve something Hallelujah and you see that is on this natural side so how much more brothers and sisters that if we are doing something for the Lord Hallelujah and we are placed here and that we we know and we believe you know that that uh that God will fulfill his promises upon us so we we don't have to stop there's no way of backing out amen time is too short to go back time is too short to go back we just have to be you know to to take this character of the Lord and and keep on going and keep on going until you know we hit the road and we say goodbye to this earth Hallelujah and there's a body change now part of the scripture that for a while I was thinking how come you know Jesus said this statement and so I just followed through through and through and and I saw something and I I I I I pray that this will be a blessing to you in Mark chapter 14 27 to 30. this speaks about Peter's you know loyalty upon the Lord and then his denial and uh his justification amen and so in verse 27 Mark 14 and Jesus said unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the ship shall be scattered but after that I am risen I will go before you into Galilee but Peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not I and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that this day even in this night before the Cockroach twice Thou shalt deny me Thrice amen so what a word to be spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ amen to a man who has just declared his loyalty and and upon saying you know when he said the shepherd will be smitten and the Sheep shall be scattered so Peter knew that the Sheep was the Lord Jesus Christ and he was part of the shepherd and so he said Lord not me amen not me I'm not going to leave you I'm not going to forsake you amen but Jesus knew right amen because Jesus knew what will happen because he knew from the beginning to the end he is the Alpha and the Omega he's the author and the finisher amen so he knew that night Peter will deny him three times Hallelujah and even at that night Jesus said Peter when you are converted right right strengthen thy Brethren oh come to think of that three years and a half Peter was with the Lord and yet not converted right right amen that's why he could not strengthen his Brethren amen so you see at this time the word of the Lord had been proven although Peter was declaring I'm not going to leave you Lord amen uh everybody might be offended but not me Lord and Jesus looked at his eyes and said you know uh but after that I am risen I will go before you into Galilee but Peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not I and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that this day even in this night before the Cockrell tries twice Thou shalt deny me Thrice amen so it only proved that Jesus knew what will take place amen but somehow he already said but after that I am risen I will go before you into Galilee so while I was reading this how come Jesus said you know Galilee has nothing to do with it it looks like why should Jesus say but after I'm risen I will go before you into Galilee amen and so I look at it once again and I followed three what have happened in the Sea of Galilee amen and if we're going to look back in Matthew chapter 4 Amen in chapter in chapter 4 of Matthew amen let's follow this in in verse 18 and 19. and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee sotu Brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers and he say it unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men amen so now I I I I can't realize why Jesus said but after I am reason again amen you're going to deny me three times this night but after I am reason again I will go before you into Galilee amen now brother Branham said you know you may have a loose grip of the Lord Jesus Christ amen but but by the time you recognize amen you go back where you love him and you're going to find him there waiting for you amen and so uh this is the time you know so now this gave me a clue why Jesus amen is going going before them into the Sea of Galilee because that was their first experience of their call amen so you see Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee so two Brethren Simon called Peter and he was talking to Peter that night he was to be arrested and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers so now all through their life amen they just go out and they know that they live amen they fish in order to live amen that's their purpose but for them you know we have to live and so that's why we have to fish so they fish in order to live amen but when the Lord Jesus Christ met them amen God had to turn amen another another way of their life they have to meet the junction of their time amen another Direction in their life before they were fishing to live amen but Jesus now told them and he said unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men Hallelujah in other words he's saying you you don't face to live but you live in order to fish amen and I'm going to make you Fishers of Men amen so since then you know they followed the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and so if you remember you know it's very much important how we go back amen where we left him just like in the church ages they left their first love amen and goddess too has to send a message of restoration that's why this is not actually a new message this is a message of restoration Amen to bring us back Amen to to what they have left they per they left their first lap so the same thing with the disciples amen they have this experience before and they had that experience in the Sea of Galilee so now I have an idea that at that same evening where Jesus was about to be arrested he knew they he had he had a hard time in the Garden of Gethsemane amen he prayed alone and he was watching the disciples that could not even stay with him another hour to pray with him and while he was in The Garden of Gethsemane you know he was praying alone and the Bible said you know he had no more tears and blood came down came out of his eyes because you know and and he said father amen you know if this cup will pass from me amen so I believe amen at that point when when the Devils heard that you know all those trees in the Garden of Gethsemane amen there were demons Oh yeah and when Jesus was crying you know they they had their own revivals probably the demons were jumping from one branch to another he said look at them look at him he cannot make it much more when they said father amen if only if this cup passed from me Hallelujah but when he said amen when he said but not my will father but your will be done amen and so the demons say oh amen they got so disappointed Hallelujah because he said the right word amen and the Bible said the Angels Came the Angels Came Amen to strengthen him Hallelujah so you know it's the same thing you know when we encounter a lot of experiences struggles in life amen and then we come to recognize at a certain point Lord amen you have must have a reason amen why you put me in this situation and that's why I'm saying Lord not my will but your will be done and that time something will take place because why say an angel is being sent to us Amen to strengthen us hallelujah so he said you know while he was in The Garden of Gethsemane he had this before the physical torture happened to him there was a mental torture that was going on you know because demons have access in the our imagination you know and and in the spirit in that realm you know they could torment and torture the Lord Jesus Christ to for him to imagine what's going to to happen to him how many luscious how many you oh all these things but even then he was persistent not my will father but your will be done Hallelujah and something happened and so you see you know that's why you know when right now I fully understood why Jesus said after I'm risen again see you in Galilee Hallelujah and so in between from that night Amen in between a lot of things have happened you know if we follow uh these scriptures in John chapter 3 20 verses 16 and 17 you know when uh he he after his death burial and resurrection and on the third day you know in verse 16 in John chapter 20 it says Jesus said unto her Mary she turned herself in saith unto him rabboni which is to say master Jesus said unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father amen and to my God and your God so this was the same morning when when Mary was looking for the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and she didn't find it amen and suddenly you know he he even she even mistaken him to be the gardener amen and and and and but when Jesus mentioned his name amen it became familiar Mary and then when she turned herself and and then she recognized him and she addressed him raboni which is to say master yes and out of excitement out of joy Mary wanted to touch Jesus amen but Jesus said unto her touch me not amen for I am not yet ascended to my father Hallelujah and then if we continue down continue on in verse 19 uh he says then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shot where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and say it unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he should unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father had sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathered on them and say it unto them receive be the Holy Ghost whosoever since ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever since ye retain they are retained but one of them right did not attend the fellowship yeah yeah but Thomas one of the 12 called the demos was not with them when Jesus the other disciples that were said unto him we have seen the Lord but he said unto them except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and trust my hand into his side I will not believe Hallelujah and you know sometimes it happens in the church you know people who you know oh the Lord blessed us last Sunday Last prayer meeting amen and people will just say oh no problem I was online yeah yeah amen my brother Branham said stay in the line he did not say stay online and so because you know people who attend the meeting regularly and they have the joy you know to travel and uh Rejoice with the other believers amen and then suddenly this one who who failed to uh to attend the prayer meeting probably you know people doing like that sometimes they justify you know and saying you know we also prayed in the house you know it's it's also scriptural to pray in the house and close your door closer close it and you just pray and you're you know you're going to experience amen but brother Branham said don't forget your prayer meetings amen where are those you know uh so you see here comes the demos and he was so proud to say oh except except I shall see in his hands and print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side I will not believe amen notice that the demos or Thomas was requiring something from the Lord that Jesus denied Mary amen Mary wanted to to touch him but Jesus said touch me now right right amen of course something happened in between and he had to go up to present uh uh the blood and all the sort and then in verse 26 and after eight days again his disciples were within and Thomas with them then came Jesus the doors being shot and stood in the midst and said Peace be unto you amen then he say it to Thomas now watch now there were many other people there were many other believers amen but because he knew what have happened eight days ago he knew what he what what Peter said so he came back eight days after for Thomas amen notice that eight days ago he denied Mary to touch him and then by uh uh by by knowing that Thomas made mention unless I put my finger in his wounds in his hands and in his sight I will not believe amen so Jesus has to go back after fulfilling something amen and he came back eight days after for Thomas he said Peace be unto you then came Jesus amen and and and and and and Thomas with them and then came Jesus the doors being shot and stood in the midst and said Peace be unto you then say it he to Thomas amen without further ado he approached Thomas and he said no Thomas amen if touching will cause you to believe Hallelujah I did not allow Mary to touch me eight days ago but I came back to you amen he said reach hide their thy finger and behold my hands and reach tighter thy hand and trust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and Thomas answered and said unto him my Lord and my God hallelujah now what I'm trying to say brothers and sisters is that you know after Jesus resurrection he had no time going back to Pilate to rebuke Pilate he did not go back to cayapas right Hallelujah when the the uh when the graves when the grave was opened when The Rock Amen that was the place in front of that cave when he broke it and then he came out Hallelujah he did not spend any time to the unbelievers he didn't spend no more time to the make-believers but he spent his time appearing amen to his disciples who are this the predestinated sons of God Daughters of God that's the same thing when the seals were opened it's no more a public show this is only for the bride after the opening of the seal the same thing as the opening of that grave for the Lord Jesus Christ he only appeared he only approached amen the Believers in that generation and to count everyone in no matter what kind of condition they wear Hallelujah the demos became you know he he doubted even the visitation of the Lord Jesus Christ eight days ago Peter denied him three times but even then you know he uh Jesus had already an answer you're going to deny me three times before the cockroach amen but even then I am going before you into Galilee so the answer is already there the solution was already there the problem wasn't done yet amen the unbelieving Peter was not able to do amen he didn't even know he was able to do that but Jesus had already a solution amen I'm going to go before you into the sea or into Galilee amen so now we know that Jesus had purpose amen and so if we move on Amen and let's go in John chapter 21 because this is all the scriptures after the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so Peter of course uh they will already in that condition it looks like they were so helpless and in verse 1 he said after these things chapter 21 of John Jesus showed himself again to the Disciples of the Sea of Tiberius of course Tiberius and Galilee were the same place and on this why should he himself there were together Simon Peter and Thomas called the Demus and Nathaniel obana in Galilee and the sons of sebedee and two other obese disciples now notice Simon Peter said unto them after denying Jesus three times amen and now Simon Peter said unto them I go fishing amen I go fishing maybe some of his Nets when Jesus called him you know he just hide it in the and now amen he was in this bus leading condition he took his net once again and go back where what he was doing before God called him amen not even knowing amen that because Jesus our lord is always on top of the situation because he already made a declaration I'm going before you into Galilee amen so even in that box leading condition Peter was moving amen but he did not know he was already moving in order to fulfill the word of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah so he said no I'm I go fishing and you know because he was a leader you know God that don't don't take away the the gift into you amen so he already although he was backslidden but but the leadership was still there so when he said I go fishing his congregation said they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing right amen so probably when so let's go fishing I go fishing we go we go with you amen and so when they pass through and probably they saw uh a certain man along the way and you know he he was uh you know doing something there's a little fire and a fish on top of it amen and he said come there's a there's a good catch probably look at that man yeah he got something and we're going to cut to catch a lot of fish tonight but when they when they throw the net nothing amen they caught nothing then but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus amen notice now Jesus said I shall go before you into Galilee so who came first then Jesus said unto them children heavy enemy amen so he he addressed them children have ye enemy they answered him no and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it from the multitude of fishes now what's the difference overnight they were they were throwing the same net on the same spot but they were throwing the net on their own but this time they were throwing the net in obedience to the word hallelujah so you see that's why there is a difference you know when you do something but you're just obeying amen your opinion our our inspiration probably but when we do something in obedience to the word it will give us results Hallelujah so now they they they did the same thing they throw the same net into the same sea amen but the difference is that now they are obeying the word amen and so when they obeyed the word they could not draw it from the multitude of fishes therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved say it unto Peter it is the Lord so John amen he recognized who was speaking to them amen and he said come on be there that's the Lord amen no look how Bach's leading Peter was when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord you know before he was preaching you know when he preached Holiness how how women should dress themselves how Brothers you know but this time look Peter heard that it was the Lord he got his Fisher's coat unto him for he was naked yeah and did cast himself into the sea and that's it in the Sea of Galilee and I would like to just put a little drama on this amen that when Peter jumped into the Sea of Galilee amen it was it was done with the purpose Jesus said after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee amen so probably when he jumped into the Sea of Galilee and he tried probably to drown himself out of guilt Hallelujah he wanted to die and here comes the Lord after all these things I denied him three times amen and probably when he was already gasping for breath he had to go up and probably hid himself behind the boat amen and and and and and and and he could you know peep in suddenly and he could see amen along the coast and he could identify that same spot and and and and and and and it brought into his remembrance Hallelujah probably when he saw that portion of that Coast he said that that's the place where we first met the Lord Jesus that was the the first place amen where he called us to to become pictures of men so all these things came back into his mind Hallelujah so I believe you know that that was the purpose why Jesus had to bring them back to the Sea of Galilee Amen to restore them back to remove all their spiritual amnesia amen and you know when I look at the Greek Lexicon about the meaning of Galilee amen Galilee means circuit amen circuit so when you go into the circuit you will feel the power of it amen and so I believe amen it has spiritual connotation that when when he was just right there everything was brought into this remembrance amen and now he realized and and little by little but something I notice here brothers and sisters amen even in Matthew maybe allow me to read that book of Matthew I just see all these are disciples you know and Jesus commissioned in Matthew 28 verse 16. then the 11 Disciples of course Judas was no longer there no unbeliever no make-believer then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but it didn't stop there but some doubted Hallelujah he rose from the dead prophecy being fulfilled before their eyes they worship Him and yet some still doubted him Hallelujah amen some doubted but I never noticed even when Jesus walked with those two disciples going to Emmaus amen he never rebuked them it was full of love and compassion amen Hallelujah just full of grace Hallelujah so you see that's why you know he he understood the condition of the disciples they were so broken they were so discouraged they were so doubting although the the scriptures have been fulfilled Before Their Eyes amen but Jesus never looked at their weaknesses Jesus was so persistent amen enriching their need Hallelujah no rebuke whatsoever but it is also full of love Hallelujah that's why you know uh brother Branham said uh uh when he spoke uh one time I just remembered this just came into my mind you know when when he was closing in prayer and then he rebuked Satan and he said you know Satan you you you you you took my son you took my daughter amen but I claimed them Hallelujah turn them loose I claim my children I claim my father I claim my mother I claim my brother I claim my sister Hallelujah turn them loose you take them you have taken them but Jesus said that brother Branham said Say Amen we have the token I claim them Hallelujah I claim them and we who have who have the word and we who have the authority we have the potential amen we can stand in the Gap and we can claim them while we are still here amen they they still have opportunity Hallelujah while we are standing on the word hallelujah those that we love amen and those also that loved us we can still do something if we could not if we cannot let them go amen I believe the purpose of that message is that to bring Grace so much in our hearts Hallelujah that we can Manifest this kind of opportunity this kind of love this kind of compassion Hallelujah now look at these disciples they were so discouraged and backslidden they were out in their position amen but Jesus was there being so persistent and perseverant amen he look at their needs rather than looking at their weaknesses Hallelujah he came down he came down he came back eight days after just for one man Thomas Hallelujah eight days before amen he said unless I touch his wounds unless I put my finger inside this wound at the side at his side I'm not going to believe it he required the Lord and the Lord met the requirement amen eight days ago he denied Mary to touch him but now he approached Thomas amen he went directly to Thomas and he said Thomas now here is my hand Hallelujah if that's one thing that will bring you back put your fingers amen so God you know Jesus had to change something but he had no dual statement whatsoever amen but he has a single purpose and that is to bring us back to him and that's why this morning we said they sang a new song why because he became a redeemer he opened us the word not only as the Creator but he became the Redeemer amen he became the revealer of his own word and it's being revealed to us hallelujah so he did everything Hallelujah just to prove that he is so persistent in reaching his hand to show that no one can pluck them out of his hand no one can pluck us out of his hand Hallelujah because he's the one reaching us he's the one doing the thing he's the one that is perseverant he's the one that is so persistent amen and so little by little you know all this is tough amen so he all these things have come back into the mind of Peter amen and so if he continues on reading the book and and he said in in John chapter 21 let's go back and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes now another spot here he said they were dragging the net with fishes but in verse 9 as soon as they were come to land they saw a fire already amen the feast that they caught they were only pulling it they were just pulling it to bring to the ghost amen but as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of course there and freeze laid there on and bread amen so the man they passed by was the Lord himself and he was cooking the fish they were coals and the peace was there out of the spoken word amen not what they caught Hallelujah many people they tried to cut something in the message amen but why it's not what what what we catch amen but it is what the Lord Cuts in what the Lord cooked amen and that is something that we have to have partaking in communion with Hallelujah and so then they Cuts amen they caught fishes but the fish that they were they were about to partake on were already there as soon as then as they were come to land they saw a fire of course there and fish laid their own and bread there is a bonus of bread Jesus said unto them bring up the fish which ye have now caught Simon Peter went up and Drew the net to land full of great wishes and 150 and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken Jesus said unto them come and dine Hallelujah there was no sermon just come and die that's a fellowship Hallelujah because Jesus realized you know it is almost the end of the road for them they were so discouraged amen but let's come and dine and none of the disciples ask him who art thou knowing that it was the Lord Jesus then cometh and take it bread and giveth them and face like Christ Hallelujah so I believe we are in almost at the end of the road Hallelujah and it's not surprising that sometimes when there is a waiting time people get discouraged people lose hope some of them our loved ones some of them we saw how serious they were in serving the lord but right before the end of the road Hallelujah we will see some people throwing away from the truth some of them we love some of them are friends some of them we won at the feet of Jesus some of them are the ones who win who won US but they're no longer here but if we have such enough love in our hearts Hallelujah and that love that that kind of compassion and we we we draw we feed from that lamp we feed on the same land and that lamb is a priest that lamb is always standing in the gap Hallelujah weather our husband our wife it's not just a believer of this message but if we stay in the message and we are feeding on the lamp Hallelujah we can still stand in the Gap and reach out and live the way we should be sometimes it's not always quoting them the scriptures quoting them the statement of the Prophet because sometimes they they have gone so far away that they could not recognize the word anymore right amen but when we come to the spot where we live the life of Christ where we live the lamb amen the inspiration the life that is in it that is that that that lamb that we we fed so much on Hallelujah has brought us in the spot brother Branham said that we can love everybody we can pray for everybody we can be alarmed to them because why we become what we eat right and if we bid on the land Hallelujah it will produce the same lamb it will produce the same kind of life that is in the lamb Hallelujah and that's why we can say Satan turn them loose I claim my son I claim my daughter I claim my wife I claim my husband Hallelujah why because God will recognize your word God will recognize your appeal upon him because we are in such a position we are in the right position Hallelujah and so we can reach out amen and that's what I said it's not always quoting that's always sermon or preaching of some sort we need that but there are certain situations that life I would rather live the sermon then preach it Hallelujah you remember Stephen and Paul you know Stephen and Paul Stephen could not argue with Paul in terms of scriptures because Paul said among the Pharisees I am a Pharisee and a simple Deacon like Stephen could not beat him into pieces in terms of scriptures but Stephen had a testimony said if we have the spirit of Beethoven we can write songs if we have the spirit of Shakespeare we can write poems and what if we have the spirit of Christ in US and that same spirit that says when he was right there at the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do right Hallelujah The Same Spirit came into Stephen and when he was placed in the same spot in the same condition Stephen said Lord judge this now against them he never said a word against them right he took all the stones that were thrown upon him Hallelujah and he had enough Grace in his heart to say Lord church this not against them and when he looked up he stole the heavens open and he saw the Lord at the right hand of the father and Paul was there he was Soul right then consented those people he did not throw a single Stone I believe but he was right there he didn't say a word to stop them in fact he he he he he looked at those garments in front of him but he was watching the life I'm Stephen Stephen did not preach to Paul but Paul was there watching the life the life of a priesthood the life of the Lamb the same similar statement Jesus said at the cross forgive them for they know not what they do similar statement Stephen said church this not against them right right and he closed his eyes and he died and so wherever Paul go he always testify on that life that he saw even in front of a king and he said one day there was a man he he kept on testifying about Stephen that's why when when he met that Pillar of Fire and he said who art thou Lord and there was a voice and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us people and Jesus did not see each other Jesus did not Paul did not directly persecute Jesus but Jesus said I am Jesus whom thou persecutes right there and then Paul realized amen that the light where he was a witness to be persecuted the first martyr in the Bible he knew he persecuted the Lord because the same spirit that was upon Stephen Hallelujah and that made way for the conversion of Paul Hallelujah so it's the same thing brothers and sisters this message has so much grace in us that's why when The Headstone came down it spoke Grace double Grace judgment will come it's a promise Revelation chapter 3 it says to him that overcome will I give to sit with me in my throne rulership judgment it will just be an icing on the cake because Revelation 10 11 if I'm not mistaken it says or 10 it says we were made Kings and Priests and we shall reign right right Hallelujah but right now while we are still here we can still pray we can still Witness we can still live the life and many people can watch it and many people will be reading the scriptures because we are the written Epistles credible men Hallelujah glory to God do you love him amen I love him because he first loved me oh God hallelujah so brother Branham said the reason you know there are certain things because he has predestinated us and there's nothing he can do but to reach us back Amen to reach us amen and uh uh uh he said we can make it because we are predestinated to it and uh uh the reason we are uh we we're going to hear is voice is that you know in in paragraph 230. of the invisible Union of the bride of Christ let me read this and I'm closing with this in in paragraph 230 said you never did it right because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life it's not the religion it's not the church it's not us but it's him amen amen God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah and let me continue on Amen and we're not tired of hearing reading this little Eagle story that brother Branham shared is that like my little Eagle story all of you has heard it a handhold farmer set a hand one time so he didn't have enough hands out eggs to go under the hand so then he found an eagle egg and they put it under him when the eagle was born it was the funniest looking chicken them chickens ever seen little old Eagle going along and the hand would go clock clock little Eagle said I don't know what the thing sounds like but I'm following her anyhow and they went out in the barnyard and began to scratch in manure piles and she clap clap clap this is good this is good you join ours and this is what that little old Eagle he couldn't eat that stop see he just went along with the chicken because he didn't know he didn't know what to do and then she went out there and she would get this or that the little Eagle he just had to stomach it he didn't know how to do it but he had seen all the chickens doing it but there's something different he didn't like that right so one day the mother knew that she had laid two eggs so she began to hunt for that other one flying around searching like the great Holy Spirit one day he flew over the Barnyard that denomination she looked down there and she seen her baby she screamed it was the voice of something that echoed from the inside of him that sounds right oh let a real predestinated born germ predestinated by God hear the word of God it's music to him he knows it's the truth he started that denominational stuff anyhow join us come go with us we got social party we got this we got it just didn't sound right to the little fellow she said Son you don't belong in that group anyhow you belong to me your mind he said Mama that sounds real how am I going to get out just make a jump I'll catch you that's all you have to do now the anointed word of God being Vindicated before any man that's born to be a Son of God With The predestinated Germ into him for this hour he'll see God's message as sure as there is God in heaven right right Martin Luther saw it for his Wesley saw it for his the Pentecostal sow it for his now what about you amen amen see they went into a denomination here is the word condemning it telling you what word to have today and just exactly Malachi for and all these other promises for the hour what do you see what are you looking at amen here we are the real genuine Eagles here my sheep know my voice The Stranger they will not follow why it was put in there by predestination you were for ordained to a Son of God you were in God before the foundation of the world your only manifested in this day for his honor and Glory how can you do it without honoring his word and stand with every word of God yes sir which you are a part of that word by predestination because look the God is the word you believe it and congregation says amen hallelujah amen so that's the very reason we accept it because we are predestinated to it right amen last verse I promise this is the last verse Jeremiah 29 11 and let us close in this scripture he says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thought so peace and not of evil to give you an expected end hallelujah what a God we serve What a Mighty God do we say when he thinks of us when he thinks of me he's not thinking anybody God has no bad memories upon each and every one of us he said the thoughts amen that I think towards you said the Lord thoughts on peace not of evil to give you an expected end hallelujah how can we question God no way so much grace and because of that so much grace we don't tend to abuse it the fact is we love him more because we have experienced so much grace that he was able to bring us back and I believe if we have a revelation how God became so persistent to us perseverant to bring us back we can have so much grace Hallelujah to pray and to reach out and stand for this message that other people may not have heard it probably we can still reach out for them and there are other people who have you know who have been here they have been part of us and yet we can still be alarmed to them and pray for them and one day soon I claim it I believe because God promised it I believe it God bless you we just pray for brother Danny amen and uh if we don't see on this part just promise me one thing that we're going to see each other again amen hallelujah not here there I'll see you in the rapture God bless you amen and I would like to call on brother Samuel Amen to uh to continue on Lord bless you we love you amen amen amen let's stand together let's give our brother a good hand I'm glad we have a persistent God that didn't give up on us he's had a lot of opportunities but he just didn't give up so he just keeps on going on Amen just make sure you tell our brother how much you appreciate him appreciate him coming by preaching for us and pray that the lord to bless him as he's traveling and then when he goes back home if you can't go as a saying goes brother uh Dan I think came up with that but Joe quotes it a lot if you can't go or maybe brother green did uh said send somebody well these brothers that go they go out and you know they take we send money they take it they go they're carrying the gospel so you're a part of it you're a part of what they're they're reaping because you're helping them out amen what we got brother 246 in the red book anybody have a need the altar's open um feet and supplies our everything satisfies you may Feast that gives us lamb will take his right to me ever be is right we're gonna be there shouldn't give up on us he didn't throw us away stable spread for the saints of God come and die just come and Believe coming down amen and amen there they found their heart's designs he is amen he's hungry blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness because he ain't going to give up on us there's a hunger in your heart he is a persistent God he's not going to give up on you hey man we give up on him a lot of times haven't we but he's never given up on us he just keeps hanging right on there it was long suffering all the way it has been waiting on you and I so let's just move into what he says one more let's say before we go back up start again who lives for Jesus is Alive in me there's no longer who lives now foreign now let's just listen and let them play one all right you love it is how much you appreciate it you'll be praying for it foreign
