[6:32] couldn't have any have each and every
[6:34] one of you with us brother richard back
[6:36] from his
[6:38] trek to arizona you can get suntan so he
[6:42] must not have stayed out in the sun too
[6:46] long
[6:49] always good to come back no place like
[6:52] home right
[6:54] no place like home you got your bibles
[6:58] go ahead and turn to daniel 9 we're
[7:00] gonna try to continue our thought on the
[7:03] study on the six fold purpose and we're
[7:06] gonna kind of take a little different
[7:07] angle
[7:08] as far as going into the sixth seal we
[7:12] covered last time
[7:14] we covered the seals in the six-fold
[7:16] purpose and we're going to kind of
[7:19] intertwine what brother dale's been
[7:21] preaching the past few
[7:23] services and just kind of
[7:26] interject a few things that that we saw
[7:28] that that may help you
[7:30] so remember me i know parents told you
[7:33] this weekend that uh
[7:35] that uh we're going i'm going out to
[7:38] brother claude's
[7:39] uh just keep him in your prayers i mean
[7:41] he's he doesn't have any help out there
[7:43] he doesn't uh
[7:44] doesn't even have a qualified deacon
[7:47] so he really doesn't have anybody to uh
[7:51] to kind of take over and while he's uh
[7:54] sick plus he needs some everybody needs
[7:56] some skin
[7:59] physical support phone phones okay and
[8:02] this is okay and that's okay
[8:03] but sometimes you just like to be there
[8:05] it's kind of like
[8:06] being there with sterling at the in the
[8:09] hospital last sunday and just
[8:11] said a simple prayer and brother aaron
[8:13] and myself and
[8:14] and i just told them according to mark
[8:16] 16 it says lay hands on the seat and
[8:17] they shall recover
[8:19] we're going to take that commission and
[8:20] we're going to apply and when you apply
[8:23] that commission
[8:24] you just leave he has nothing else to do
[8:26] you just forget about the symptoms i
[8:28] mean he was throwing up
[8:29] i mean we saw in a cup he was throwing
[8:31] up big clots of blood
[8:32] huge clots of blood but pretty good size
[8:34] enough to make you worry
[8:36] but then to hear that he came home the
[8:38] next day we know that that god was there
[8:40] and we gave him all the praise
[8:43] so we're going to take a prayer cloth to
[8:44] brother claude so we're at the end of
[8:46] the service remind me if i forget i've
[8:48] got a big note here but sometimes you
[8:50] overlook these things but we're going to
[8:52] all as a church pray
[8:54] because he really thinks a lot of each
[8:55] and every one of you and we all
[8:57] thank a lot of the big guy out there too
[8:59] so it's just
[9:00] just tough for him to be uh started with
[9:03] pneumonia
[9:04] they sent us a text last night and said
[9:06] he was had pneumonia
[9:08] and that they were going to take him to
[9:10] the hospital because his blood pressure
[9:11] was 200 over 83
[9:13] and then when they got into the hospital
[9:15] they found out he had a urinary tract
[9:17] infection and he couldn't
[9:20] he couldn't eliminate any fluids and
[9:22] being a diabetic
[9:24] they really were concerned because he
[9:26] couldn't get any fluid off so now
[9:27] they've
[9:28] they've uh done a catheter so they're
[9:30] going to keep him he's going to be stuck
[9:32] there two or three days at least
[9:33] two days they said and uh they've
[9:35] they're testing him for congestive heart
[9:37] failure
[9:38] and prostate trouble so just keep him in
[9:41] your prayers
[9:42] and just remember that um that we're
[9:45] going to be traveling
[9:46] um brother benny is going to give us a
[9:48] plane flight i just talked to him a few
[9:49] minutes ago and
[9:50] he's going to get us a real cheap plane
[9:52] flight so it's not going to cost a lot
[9:54] to get out there so
[9:55] just keep him in your prayers and keep
[9:56] us in your prayers because it'll be a
[9:58] pretty short
[9:59] visit but we're going to try to leave
[10:00] out friday evening and get back on
[10:03] monday
[10:04] but it's just something that i want to
[10:05] do because he's a good friend of mine
[10:07] and i hope you all understand that i
[10:08] won't be here for the uh
[10:10] christmas dinner so um
[10:13] somebody'll have to step up parents can
[10:15] step up and take over all the all the
[10:18] giving outs and stuff and
[10:20] he's he's well capable to do that also
[10:23] remember i
[10:24] brother tim and sister esther's doing
[10:26] great they've sent me several
[10:28] uh text messages and and a few pictures
[10:32] of of their honeymoon so it all went
[10:35] well
[10:36] he's doing good she's doing good so just
[10:39] keep them in your prayers because they
[10:40] need it
[10:40] i want to make one little announcement
[10:42] too and it's not a
[10:44] um i it's kind of funny but yeah i want
[10:46] you to listen because
[10:48] brother dale doesn't text now the bible
[10:51] says faith comes by hearing
[10:53] right right not by testing right
[10:57] and the bible said in the days of the
[10:59] voice of the seventh angel
[11:00] not the days of the texts of the seventh
[11:02] angel right now i just got into the text
[11:04] mode some myself
[11:06] but if something no what i'm trying to
[11:08] say if something's going on in this
[11:10] church
[11:11] you can't text brother dale right and
[11:14] and get any answer
[11:16] you gotta call him or you can text me
[11:19] and i'll call him or physically
[11:21] because what will happen is if you call
[11:23] his cell phone number some of you may
[11:24] have already done it
[11:26] if it goes to voicemail it sends you
[11:29] a link to me where you can call me on my
[11:31] cell phone because i keep mine with me
[11:32] most of the time but what i'm saying is
[11:34] like with sterling being in the hospital
[11:36] and people being in the hospital if you
[11:38] need to get in touch with brother dale
[11:39] don't go on facebook for sure and don't
[11:43] text him because he's not gonna get it
[11:45] right actually don't even leave him a
[11:47] voicemail right
[11:49] he's not gonna get it that's why when i
[11:52] set up his voicemail i set it up to
[11:54] where it says that if you can't reach
[11:56] brother dale and if you need to
[11:57] find him my phone number my cell phone
[12:00] number is on there for you to call me
[12:02] so and i don't mind because i keep mine
[12:04] with me most of the time but he's not
[12:06] tech savvy obviously i was thinking in
[12:08] the shower the other day the bible says
[12:10] faith comes by hearing
[12:11] right not by texting right so i know
[12:14] it's an age to where we like to text
[12:16] each other but
[12:17] if you need brother dale you need to
[12:18] call him right on his physical telephone
[12:20] right so because you never know what
[12:23] happens but we're so used to pulling out
[12:25] a phone and sending a text
[12:27] until it's just nothing you know he's
[12:29] not going to get it
[12:30] right you don't get it so you just send
[12:33] him
[12:34] um even not even a voicemail it's going
[12:36] to come to me so
[12:37] just leave it on on there and i'll get
[12:39] it on my phone so
[12:41] just remember that but but really i mean
[12:43] that's just the way it is
[12:44] you're going to get in touch with
[12:45] brotherdale you need to call them and
[12:46] physically call call them on the
[12:48] telephone
[12:48] all right and also remember uh
[12:52] brother jason jackson's gonna be here
[12:54] this this um
[12:55] the weekend of the uh of the watch night
[12:58] service he's a good brother
[13:00] met him uh up in uh uh virginia
[13:04] and he's good brother good brother and
[13:07] also remember i don't know if any of you
[13:08] know who the laster family is that
[13:10] brother
[13:10] um up in kentucky they used to go to
[13:13] brother butler's church but uh we've
[13:15] known him for a long time but
[13:17] but uh the oldest bruce his um
[13:20] wife is dying with cancer they found it
[13:23] only about a week ago and they've only
[13:24] given her a couple of weeks to live
[13:26] uh her colon burst yesterday and they
[13:28] did operation on it and found that she
[13:30] had cancer all through her body
[13:32] but you know what i don't mean one thing
[13:35] to god that's right
[13:36] i don't mean one thing to god just keep
[13:39] him in your prayers though because it's
[13:40] really a shock
[13:41] about this time and also remember one
[13:44] other request
[13:45] we've got a salesman that works in our
[13:47] livonia office
[13:48] uh his name is hal sauder and his father
[13:51] passed away
[13:52] yesterday so uh just keep him in your
[13:55] prayers also
[13:57] and really just it's a trying time
[14:00] but you know what god built us for this
[14:03] that's right he built this for this time
[14:04] so this is just the way it's going to be
[14:06] he built us to take it
[14:08] he built us to take it if not we
[14:10] wouldn't take it we'd go crazy but he
[14:11] built us to take this time so you just
[14:13] trust in god
[14:14] whatever symptoms come don't worry about
[14:16] the symptoms we look into a god
[14:18] that takes care of all those things he
[14:20] never works off symptoms
[14:22] never he never works off symptoms he
[14:24] never says well if this gets but no he
[14:25] said i'm the lord to heal with all your
[14:27] being
[14:28] so let's just keep all these in in our
[14:30] prayer let's go to the lord and prayer

[16:09] amen daniel 9 24
[16:13] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[16:15] and upon thy holy city
[16:18] and we're going to look at tonight we're
[16:20] going see this the people
[16:22] we're gonna take a little bit with the
[16:24] city and at the end of the service
[16:26] we're gonna maybe kind of move over a
[16:28] little bit into the end of the trumpets
[16:30] if we have time if we don't
[16:32] we'll do it at another time but we know
[16:34] that all the trumpets sound under the
[16:35] sixth seal
[16:36] so they all come right there together
[16:38] but seventy weeks are determined upon
[16:40] thy city and upon
[16:41] upon thy people excuse me and upon thy
[16:44] holy city to do six things
[16:46] to finish the transgression to make an
[16:49] end of sins
[16:51] to make reconciliation for iniquity to
[16:54] bring in everlasting righteousness
[16:56] to seal up the vision and prophecy and
[16:59] to anoint the most holy now let's go to
[17:01] revelations chapter 6
[17:03] where we've been in the study on the
[17:07] on the uh sixth seal revelation six
[17:10] verse twelve
[17:12] and i beheld we had opened the sixth
[17:13] seal and lo there was a great earthquake
[17:15] keep these things in mind the great
[17:17] earthquake the sun became black as sack
[17:19] cloth of hair
[17:20] the moon became its blood and the stars
[17:22] of heaven fell into the earth even as a
[17:23] fig tree cancer untimely figs
[17:26] now watch all this this is all happening
[17:28] to what nature
[17:29] all right when she is shaking shaking of
[17:32] a mighty wind and the heaven departed as
[17:34] a scroll when it is rolled together and
[17:35] every mountain and island were moved out
[17:37] of their places
[17:38] and the kings of the earth and the great
[17:40] men and the rich men and the chief
[17:42] captains and the mighty men and every
[17:44] bondman and every freeman hid themselves
[17:46] in the dens and in the rocks of the
[17:47] mountains why because of
[17:48] what was happening in nature
[17:52] right right right what was happening in
[17:55] nature
[17:56] right and so it said to the mountains
[17:59] no i'm sorry and the kings of the earth
[18:00] let's finish that one and the great men
[18:02] rich men chief captains mighty men
[18:04] every barman ever freeman hid themselves
[18:06] in the dens and in the rocks of the
[18:07] mountains
[18:08] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[18:10] on us and hide us from the face of him
[18:12] that sitteth on the throne
[18:14] and from the wrath of the lamb for the
[18:16] great day of his wrath
[18:18] is come not has or will this is
[18:22] come by present tense we know it's a
[18:23] future event to us but is come
[18:27] so let's bring it down to the day he has
[18:30] come because we're going to talk natural
[18:31] and spiritual tithe
[18:32] and who shall be able to stand amen
[18:35] there's a question who
[18:36] shall be able to stand you may be seated
[18:39] in the lord as blessing to the reading
[18:40] of the word
[18:42] but now look at all these events these
[18:44] events remember that keep that in your
[18:46] mind
[18:46] events brother brown said modern events
[18:49] made clear by prophecy
[18:51] so let's look at these events and see
[18:54] what we're not going to pick each one of
[18:56] them down but we're going to try to go
[18:58] back and
[18:58] and you know brother dale was was
[19:00] preaching the other day and he's always
[19:02] said it but it kind of struck me he said
[19:04] one seal will tell the entire the entire
[19:06] bible together
[19:07] well it's kind of hard sometimes without
[19:08] a spiritual eye to go back
[19:10] and see now i know he's preached it and
[19:13] so have i
[19:14] is where you bring in the
[19:17] four horsemen in genesis
[19:21] with cain and abel all right the
[19:23] blackness of cain and all that
[19:25] but we realize that in this sixth seal
[19:28] this sixth seal
[19:29] is we're gonna read it in just a few
[19:31] minutes but it's a purging time
[19:33] right right the sixth seal was a purging
[19:37] time so
[19:37] god has started since the fall now he
[19:40] didn't need to purge man before the fall
[19:44] man was perfect right the nature was
[19:47] perfect
[19:48] exactly uh the the order of nature was
[19:51] perfect there was no earthquakes before
[19:53] the fall there was no thundering
[19:54] lightning there was no
[19:55] typhoons there was no floods there was
[19:57] no things that that harm
[20:00] the earth and in harming the earth you
[20:03] know we get caught up in that
[20:05] sure they just had a philippines
[20:07] yesterday
[20:09] a typhoon killed 200 and some people
[20:12] just like that
[20:13] because so you're caught up in the
[20:15] nature we can't get away from the
[20:17] natural part of this earth
[20:19] right but when it was in perfect harmony
[20:22] with god the way it should have been
[20:24] adam didn't have to run from nature
[20:27] right
[20:27] eve didn't have to run from nature amen
[20:30] right
[20:30] all right but the animals didn't have to
[20:33] run from each other
[20:34] right then i have to run
[20:37] right peace
[20:40] that's why it comes over until this time
[20:42] and it says peace on earth
[20:44] man good will to man well there's never
[20:46] been peace on earth since the fall
[20:48] that's right but we know that jesus
[20:50] christ brought peace
[20:52] when he came right right man
[20:55] he just hadn't been applied yet we're
[20:57] going to talk about that a little bit
[20:58] but we got to see that
[21:00] that god didn't just that sick seal
[21:02] doesn't just happen with two prophets
[21:04] opening it
[21:05] we know it's gonna happen because it
[21:07] says it in the bible
[21:08] and brother brown said those two
[21:09] prophets open those that sex seal
[21:11] right but we need to see though that if
[21:13] that sick seal is a purging seal or
[21:16] or a sanctifying seal right
[21:19] right yeah we got to see that after the
[21:21] fall even when
[21:22] even when i'm kind of jumping ahead a
[21:24] little bit but when god said i'll put
[21:26] enmity
[21:29] he was getting ready to purge some
[21:31] people right and persian earth he was
[21:33] going to bring everything back to where
[21:35] it should have been
[21:36] to start with right all right so the
[21:38] sixth seal is a
[21:39] seal of nature breaking forth
[21:43] and then you and i are caught in that
[21:46] right
[21:47] because we're part of nature right right
[21:49] all right and
[21:50] let's look at let's pull up number a and
[21:52] let's look and see what purge means
[21:55] because the word purges is all
[21:57] throughout the bible
[21:58] it's it's a it's a wonderful word
[22:01] because it says
[22:02] purge me lord
[22:07] in hebrews it talks about purging and
[22:09] john we'll read it in just a minute
[22:12] first corinthians says purge out
[22:14] therefore the old heaven
[22:17] all right so purging has been spoken
[22:20] back into genesis
[22:21] but look the word purge means
[22:24] to cleanse of filth and purity
[22:27] now watch this it says trees and vines
[22:30] in other words
[22:30] pruning is the same word as purging
[22:33] right
[22:35] because if you don't if you don't prune
[22:37] your vines i have apple trees and i have
[22:40] plum trees and i have certain different
[22:43] plants and even if i could get to my
[22:45] pecan trees i
[22:46] trim them but you're supposed to trim
[22:49] back
[22:51] to bring more fruit jesus said right
[22:54] here in john 15
[22:55] 22 and 15 2 it's not on there but listen
[22:58] every branch in me that beareth not
[23:01] fruit he taketh away
[23:03] and every branch that beareth fruit he
[23:06] purgeth it right
[23:08] that it may bring forth more fruit sure
[23:11] so the more word purrs the more food
[23:13] fruit will bring forth the more the
[23:15] apple tree you say no you're hurting the
[23:17] apple tree
[23:17] now you're cutting away what the apple
[23:19] tree doesn't need right
[23:21] remember in the corn ears of corn come
[23:24] up and then you got the little suckers
[23:26] well what does the suckers do
[23:27] that's why they're called suckers right
[23:29] right they suck the nutrients out of the
[23:31] tree out of the the stalk
[23:33] but it's useless it'll never come to
[23:35] fruition right
[23:38] it'll never bear fruit it's a sucker
[23:40] it's stunning
[23:41] but it is going to draw that nutrition
[23:44] from that main stalk
[23:46] and cause it to not bring forth much
[23:47] fruit right but that's what jesus said
[23:49] he said purge
[23:52] the vine and it'll bring forth more
[23:54] fruit so how many of us want to be pervs
[23:56] absolutely to bring forth more fruit all
[23:58] right
[23:59] but now look it says also to cleanse
[24:02] look down here at 16 where it says 16 in
[24:04] parentheses
[24:05] all right to make clean to be
[24:09] clean to purify to make cleaner cleanse
[24:12] from physical stains and dirt
[24:14] oh yeah we can purge the outside of this
[24:16] guy but what about the inside right
[24:18] right all right in a moral sense to free
[24:20] from defilement of sin and from fault
[24:22] now that's what god's doing
[24:24] in daniel 9 24
[24:28] he is going to purge a group of people
[24:30] amen
[24:31] and the earth right right that's right
[24:35] the earth fell when we fell right right
[24:38] the earth found the earth fell because
[24:40] we felt right
[24:42] it wasn't the earth's fault it wasn't
[24:45] the deer's fault
[24:46] right it wasn't the lion's fault that he
[24:48] has to eat another
[24:49] being to survive it's our fault that's
[24:52] right
[24:53] right that's why in romans it says the
[24:54] whole world growing up in travailus
[24:56] waiting on lazy me and you yeah
[25:00] right all right roll it on up is that
[25:02] true
[25:03] right ethically free from corrupt desire
[25:06] from sin and guilt free from
[25:08] every admixture of what is false right
[25:12] in other words we don't want to mix
[25:13] anything with false
[25:15] right sincere genuine blameless innocent
[25:19] unstained with the guilt of anything
[25:22] that's what
[25:23] purging is and that's what purging
[25:26] does so you see what the word purge
[25:28] means it means to cleanse right
[25:30] cleanse me o lord try me o lord purge me
[25:34] o lord but look
[25:36] the effects of the fall we can't get
[25:38] around yeah
[25:41] right we're here but you and i are left
[25:45] with this one thing
[25:49] the last group of people
[25:52] to bring it back that's right right amen
[25:57] without fat without that
[26:01] you forget about 144 000 right
[26:05] because god come to purge me and you
[26:07] first
[26:09] then he goes to israel then he then he
[26:11] goes to the earth and then he does these
[26:13] things for the others
[26:14] you and i are the ones that's holding
[26:17] this whole thing off amen
[26:20] okay you saw not me yeah you're the
[26:23] first one
[26:26] let's look it wrong let's look at romans
[26:27] eight now look how clear it is in romans
[26:32] for the earnest expectation of the
[26:34] creature now what is that and look at
[26:35] your scofield bible it says creation
[26:39] so that's going all the way back to
[26:40] genesis right all right
[26:42] for the earnest expectation of the
[26:44] creature waited
[26:46] they're waiting on us amen for the
[26:48] manifestation of the sons of god
[26:50] for the creature was made subject to
[26:52] vanity not willingly
[26:54] the line didn't fall because he wanted
[26:56] to the cheetah didn't fall because he
[26:58] wanted to
[27:00] the tree doesn't die because he wants to
[27:02] right
[27:03] it died because we did it right so not
[27:06] willingly
[27:06] they were subject to vanity not
[27:09] willingly but by reason of him who has
[27:11] subjected the same in hope
[27:12] amen so we
[27:15] they're under subjection to us subject
[27:19] right right to the same in hope that
[27:22] we're going to bring it back
[27:23] right amen all right because the
[27:25] creature itself also shall be delivered
[27:27] amen exactly success delivered purged
[27:32] from the bodies of corruption into the
[27:34] glorious liberty of the children of god
[27:36] for we know that the whole creation
[27:38] not one speck of dirt
[27:41] that's not groaning right and travailing
[27:45] right read birth pains
[27:49] the world is in birth pains that's right
[27:53] why because we're here right
[27:57] it's trying to bring forth something
[27:59] from the earth right
[28:00] but we know that you know that's why
[28:02] they call it mother earth
[28:03] right it's what's called mother earth
[28:05] this is mother earth that's what mother
[28:07] nature
[28:07] right okay it's a nurturing of the earth
[28:11] it's the mother part
[28:13] but we know that the whole creation
[28:15] groaneth
[28:16] and travailleth in pain
[28:20] that's why claude's sitting in the
[28:22] hospital that's why sister jamie's
[28:24] that's why we're sick that's why all
[28:25] these things are happening right
[28:28] right in pain together until now
[28:32] so let's come to a place to say until
[28:34] now
[28:36] until now so we can do something about
[28:38] it and he says until now
[28:40] paul's prophesying but we're standing
[28:42] now in that prophecy
[28:43] right all right so god began to cleanse
[28:49] back in the garden of eden when he said
[28:52] i'll put enmity or a division between me
[28:55] and your seed
[28:56] because your seed's corrupt and mine's
[28:58] not right right
[29:01] your seed can't bring anything back mine
[29:03] will amen
[29:05] you can't purge your seed i can purge
[29:09] mine
[29:10] right right because of what happened
[29:12] we're going to have to be purged
[29:13] remember that's permissive well perfect
[29:15] will was we didn't have to be purged
[29:17] right all right let's uh let's go to
[29:20] number one
[29:22] let's look what brother brown said on a
[29:23] sixth seal now before we get started
[29:26] listen to this because remember our body
[29:30] goes first
[29:31] right right our body's purged and
[29:34] redeemed first
[29:35] right then the earth follows amen right
[29:38] right okay
[29:39] so remember this you say well well i i i
[29:42] don't know about this per
[29:43] listen even in your physical body
[29:47] right now you're being purged that's
[29:49] right
[29:50] that's right if not you're like brother
[29:52] claude see his body can't purge that
[29:54] water
[29:55] that's being produced by those damaged
[29:57] cells
[29:59] same thing with cancer cancer is what
[30:02] they do
[30:03] is they they take the chemotherapy and
[30:04] they shoot that chemo in there
[30:06] and try to kill your blood cells to
[30:10] raise those white ones up right
[30:12] the white ones does the fighting right
[30:14] the white ones does the fighting
[30:16] and that's what you're trying to do
[30:17] you're trying to break the body down
[30:18] enough to where the body says
[30:19] hey i gotta start fighting this thing
[30:21] right he tries to bring himself what
[30:23] he's trying to purge that stuff out so
[30:26] so even we know obviously certain things
[30:28] we know is purge but every day
[30:30] you sweat you do the things of life your
[30:33] your body is being purged
[30:35] but now remember adam didn't have to do
[30:37] that before the fall
[30:40] adam's body was perfect he could live in
[30:42] that body and not have to be purged
[30:44] because he had no
[30:45] sin you say how can his body be redeemed
[30:49] simple get it back to the same condition
[30:52] adam was
[30:53] right exactly because he didn't have to
[30:59] be purged every day right now after the
[31:01] fall
[31:02] that's what happened he had to start
[31:04] being purged every day his body did
[31:06] to keep his body have fever right now
[31:09] right when you have fever take fluids
[31:12] drink why they tell you drink fluids
[31:13] liquids and all that stuff
[31:14] what to purge out the bad stuff out of
[31:17] your body
[31:18] right same thing now take that in a
[31:20] spiritual sense
[31:23] get a bad cancer get a bad cold get a
[31:25] bad attitude
[31:30] amen get a bad thought against somebody
[31:32] get a bad desk get about that
[31:35] what's god do he sends you a little
[31:38] fever
[31:39] called a preacher yeah and he gets your
[31:42] blood pressure up a little bit
[31:45] and hopefully that helps you purge a
[31:46] little bit of that out
[31:48] now look brother i want a sixth seal
[31:50] that's the way it works
[31:51] i can see more how god works just in
[31:54] nature
[31:55] right just in nature because that's what
[31:57] he's in that's what he used
[32:00] he used nature that's why
[32:03] nature is going to have to do a reversal
[32:06] that's why those two prophets are going
[32:08] to call those plagues down what
[32:09] to purge this earth but it's going to
[32:12] purge a group of people too
[32:13] right all right same way with you and i
[32:16] we're being purged by the word now
[32:18] all right now i want you to read with me
[32:20] as you do compare scriptures of this
[32:22] great event that we will see
[32:24] that this great secret or mystery that
[32:26] was under the sixth seal
[32:28] of the book of redemption
[32:31] book of redemption all right now
[32:34] remember these are hidden mysteries
[32:36] and the sixth seal all together is one
[32:39] great big
[32:40] book just six scrolls rolled together
[32:43] and it unwinds the whole book of
[32:45] redemption
[32:46] that's how the whole earth
[32:50] was redeemed amen was by that sixth seal
[32:54] but now remember where did it begin does
[32:56] it begin with two prophets
[32:59] well what did god do in genesis let's
[33:02] look at number two and a sixth seal now
[33:06] see
[33:06] if we can get back here under these
[33:08] seals if they can
[33:10] ever get when they're open you can see
[33:13] exactly look
[33:15] what god is doing what he has done
[33:19] and what he's going to do which is
[33:22] which was which is to come right right
[33:26] so it doesn't just show the sixth seal
[33:27] as being boom
[33:30] you and i must understand
[33:33] how that seal works all the way through
[33:36] the bible
[33:37] how the first seal works all the way
[33:38] through the bible the second seal i just
[33:40] picked the sixth seal because i'm in the
[33:42] sixth fold purpose
[33:44] and it fits in good with it because
[33:45] you're gonna have to redeem a group of
[33:47] people out of that six-fold purpose
[33:49] right that last week that but the last
[33:52] three and a half years of jesus's
[33:54] ministry
[33:56] on earth through two prophets is going
[33:58] to thoroughly purge
[33:59] right what did john tell him john told
[34:02] him
[34:02] said his fan is in his hand and he's
[34:04] gonna what he will thoroughly
[34:06] purge the floor amen now what does the
[34:09] threshing
[34:10] do they throw the weed up
[34:13] the tears in the chaff floats off with
[34:16] the wind
[34:18] go somewhere else starts living a
[34:22] different life
[34:24] we're going to look at a little animal
[34:25] in just a few minutes that
[34:27] i had a i had some familiarity with
[34:30] several years ago and was able to learn
[34:32] from it but
[34:33] what comes back down the wheat all the
[34:36] others burnt
[34:37] right all right so that's what he was
[34:38] saying his fan is in his hand that's
[34:40] what he was doing he was fanning the
[34:41] wheat
[34:42] i knew a thoroughly purged his floor
[34:44] well guess what
[34:46] he's talking about me and you right
[34:47] right we know he was talking about
[34:49] purging
[34:51] the people that were there that's what
[34:53] john was talking about he said he'll
[34:54] thoroughly purge the floor
[34:55] well which floor is he going to start
[34:56] with he's going to start with this one
[34:58] when they're open you can see exactly
[35:00] what god is doing what he has done and
[35:02] what he's going to do
[35:04] all right so that which is which was and
[35:07] which is to come
[35:08] all right because you're going to see
[35:10] that this sixth seal
[35:11] brother brown said open in a threefold
[35:13] matter right
[35:15] so we're going to see how that is in
[35:16] just a few minutes now go to number
[35:18] three
[35:20] and finding in this this is in look and
[35:22] finding in this sixth seal that there's
[35:23] a great interruption
[35:25] in nature keep that word nature
[35:30] okay you're gonna think about trees and
[35:32] and
[35:33] and wind and rain and
[35:36] let's talk about this nature yeah right
[35:39] there's what change
[35:40] purges our nature that's right the holy
[35:42] ghost comes in sure and it burns out all
[35:44] the stuff but remember they're still
[35:46] doors
[35:46] yeah remember the the dream that sister
[35:48] shepard had there was water flowing out
[35:51] over
[35:52] right the pyramid and it had one in it
[35:56] trash yeah you still got trash in you
[36:00] even if you're born again that's right
[36:02] but we're going to look and see though i
[36:03] was telling brother donnie
[36:04] he kind of got into my sermon i had to
[36:06] walk out of the room so i told him i
[36:07] said dude
[36:08] you're going to hear it tonight so you
[36:09] don't have to hear it there so the moon
[36:11] the stars the earth belts forth
[36:13] the church is purged israel is purged
[36:16] and everything is purged under that
[36:18] seventh seal we know he was going to the
[36:20] seventh seal
[36:21] so that the millennium can start in
[36:23] there has to be a cleansing first
[36:25] so for god to step on the earth there's
[36:27] got to be a cleansing
[36:28] for god to step into your earth there's
[36:30] got to be a cleansing there's got to be
[36:32] a purging all right
[36:33] and that's what the church today and
[36:34] what i want to point that you need you
[36:36] that we need a cleansing now that word
[36:39] cleansing means
[36:40] what purging all right before anything
[36:42] can begin
[36:43] from god listen before
[36:48] read that before anything right can
[36:51] begin from god we've got to have a
[36:54] purging
[36:55] and when we see when we look and see
[36:58] things
[36:59] that is now under the present condition
[37:01] existing
[37:02] the way they are we can see that we got
[37:05] to have something to happen
[37:07] before god can continue his program
[37:12] and the purging right god's program
[37:16] what's god's program he had a plan and a
[37:18] purpose what
[37:19] to do all god was he poured into christ
[37:22] all christ loves you pour into the
[37:23] church take her back to the garden of
[37:24] eden
[37:25] that's where we went from that's where
[37:27] we got to go back to
[37:29] amen right that's what the purging is
[37:31] going to take us back to
[37:32] all right okay so that's in look but now
[37:35] all right let's go to
[37:36] now genesis 7 because god started to
[37:39] purge the earth way back in the book of
[37:41] genesis
[37:43] with the flood
[37:46] there's a six seal purging of the earth
[37:49] beginning of the
[37:50] purging and the flood and not brother
[37:52] brandon will tell you that in a minute
[37:53] he even says moses the plagues that fell
[37:57] on egypt was a
[37:58] purging right to purge them out of egypt
[38:03] okay now listen listen to this though
[38:06] there was no cleansing factor at that
[38:09] time
[38:10] to cleanse the people
[38:14] from sin right that's right it was only
[38:17] covered
[38:18] right that's right right so it wasn't a
[38:21] purging like we're talking about now but
[38:23] yet it is in type
[38:25] a purging because what happened why did
[38:27] pharaoh let the people go because moses
[38:29] walked up every day and said let my
[38:31] people go right
[38:32] no because of nature
[38:36] because of the falling of nature around
[38:40] egypt he finally said i've had enough
[38:44] right right i've had enough
[38:48] i told him i said we have been
[38:52] a lot of things have happened but
[38:55] there's one thing for sure
[38:58] the elected is going to be ejected one
[39:01] of these days like brother ernie said
[39:04] and what do you do when you purge you
[39:07] eject
[39:08] when you excuse my language when you
[39:11] throw up
[39:12] that's a purging right the reason you
[39:14] get sick and regurgitate is because
[39:16] something in you
[39:17] doesn't need to be there it's a it's a
[39:20] it's a little virus or something and
[39:22] it's got to be purged
[39:23] what you do you get it out right
[39:26] you get rid of the stuff right
[39:30] that's right exactly everything uh
[39:33] everything goes goes along i mean i was
[39:35] sitting the other day and i thought man
[39:37] and i come up on a little animal and i
[39:38] won't tell you about him in a minute
[39:40] okay forget seven days and i will call
[39:42] it rain upon the earth 40 days and 40
[39:44] nights and
[39:45] every living substance
[39:50] every living substance that i have made
[39:52] will i
[39:53] destroy from off the face of the earth
[39:55] why
[39:57] the the imagination of men's mind the
[39:59] bible says
[40:00] was continually evil god had come to a
[40:04] place to where and listen let me just be
[40:06] honest with you god couldn't cleanse the
[40:10] people
[40:12] brother that okay god couldn't cleanse
[40:14] the people
[40:16] there was no blood
[40:19] sure he said i'll put empty which was a
[40:21] prophecy
[40:22] but he hadn't come yet but he knew he
[40:24] was coming so god's patient
[40:27] god said i'm going to wipe this thing
[40:28] off if you believe me i'll save you
[40:32] i'm going to give you 120 years to
[40:34] listen to this one preacher
[40:36] yeah right that's right and they must
[40:38] have hated him at the end and the
[40:39] beginning because he didn't get no more
[40:41] congregation than what he started with
[40:43] right all right fear not a little flop
[40:47] that was only eight and one of them was
[40:49] the devil
[40:50] right ham that's right but now look
[40:53] watch what he done though because he
[40:54] showed this in tight i have
[40:56] every living substance every tree died
[41:00] all the grass not
[41:01] everything remember when the fountains
[41:03] of deep of the deep right here look
[41:05] it wasn't just a 40-day rain i've been
[41:07] through this with you before but some of
[41:08] the new ones are here
[41:09] it's not just a 40-day rain that
[41:11] destroyed this earth listen
[41:13] in the 600th year of noah's life
[41:16] in the second month 17th day of the
[41:18] month the same day where all the
[41:20] fountains of the great deep broken up
[41:22] now if you'll look somebody sent it to
[41:24] me a long time ago but i can't remember
[41:26] they did a study
[41:28] remember the ground was being
[41:31] moisturized coming up out of the ground
[41:34] right
[41:35] that's what the bible said right there
[41:36] was no rain there was no clouds
[41:38] there was moisture coming up out of the
[41:40] ground and that
[41:41] gave you your your moistness of the soil
[41:45] so what was underneath there was
[41:47] viaducts of water
[41:48] right running underneath when god
[41:50] created the earth he made those viaducts
[41:53] under the water big ones i ain't talking
[41:55] about these little buildings i'm talking
[41:56] big big ones and what happened was
[42:00] all the fountains in the deep what
[42:01] happened was they broke
[42:04] they broke up and when they did they
[42:05] flipped yeah
[42:07] that's right a total interruption of
[42:09] nature right
[42:11] but that god couldn't save those people
[42:13] as he's purging them now
[42:16] because the blood sacrifice was not
[42:17] there we know before the foundation of
[42:19] the world but listen
[42:20] why didn't god just save the whole world
[42:22] yeah if that was true
[42:25] no he's still his program still is you
[42:28] believe what i say
[42:29] i'll save you right amen
[42:32] it was then and it is now right only
[42:35] eight people and it's
[42:36] i was thinking about this this morning
[42:38] the bible says as it was in the days of
[42:39] noah there's seven billion people on the
[42:41] earth right now
[42:42] yeah there were seven billion people on
[42:44] the earth in noah's age
[42:46] eight people one two three four five six
[42:49] seven eight
[42:50] sorry for you
[42:54] well i'm one of the animals but from
[42:57] here back died
[42:59] only eight people when they walked out
[43:01] of that ark
[43:03] there was only eight people on the earth
[43:05] because god said every living substance
[43:07] that i have made
[43:08] i will destroy right okay
[43:13] and every living substance was destroyed
[43:15] which was upon the face of the ground
[43:17] both man
[43:17] cattle creeping things foul of the
[43:19] heaven they were destroyed from the
[43:21] earth and noah
[43:22] only remained alive and they that were
[43:24] with him in the ark
[43:26] and the waters prevailed on the earth
[43:27] 150 days anybody know how many
[43:29] how long ago was in the ark 140 days
[43:34] but one year one month i've got my bible
[43:37] he was in that ark over a year
[43:39] right feeding those animals
[43:43] how
[43:46] must have been god but see god had a
[43:50] program
[43:52] that he was going to destroy the world
[43:55] but those that believed him
[43:57] went over on the ark right right all
[43:59] right
[44:00] so now god has started a purging of the
[44:04] earth
[44:06] because nature was lost right brother
[44:08] brown said everything fell in the garden
[44:10] of eden right
[44:11] right you and i first and then
[44:12] everything tumbled behind it all right
[44:14] so now let's go to
[44:18] all right we got all those let's go to
[44:20] exodus 10
[44:23] because brother brown said right here's
[44:25] where god
[44:27] purged israel and the lord said unto
[44:29] moses stretch out thy hand toward heaven
[44:32] that there may be darkness because
[44:33] brother brown he goes in that sixth seal
[44:36] and he said see he said there's been
[44:38] darkness in the land a lot more than
[44:40] just
[44:40] the time of the sixth chapter the sixth
[44:43] chapter of revelations
[44:45] these two prophets are not gonna bring
[44:47] something on the scene that hadn't
[44:48] already happened
[44:50] earthquakes and you know not rain for
[44:53] three and a half years they're used to
[44:55] it because god did it during the time
[44:57] that they were here moses and elijah
[44:59] stretch out thy hand toward heaven that
[45:01] there may be darkness over the land of
[45:02] egypt even darkness which may be felt
[45:07] and moses stretched forth his hand
[45:08] toward heaven and there was a thick
[45:10] darkness in all the land of egypt three
[45:11] days
[45:12] and they saw not one another neither
[45:14] rose any from his place for three days
[45:17] but all the children of israel
[45:18] had light in their dwellings goshen
[45:21] remember they had life
[45:24] right so god was taking care of his
[45:26] people that he was getting ready to
[45:28] purge out of
[45:29] israel i'm out of egypt because that's
[45:31] getting over toward the end
[45:33] of the purging time all right now let's
[45:36] go to number four
[45:38] quote number four this is brother brown
[45:40] he talks about this on the sixth seal
[45:43] all right now let's turn to exodus 10 21
[45:46] through 23 exodus 10 21. now i just read
[45:48] that to you and scroll up
[45:50] notice just exactly like come over here
[45:53] and the sun
[45:54] became as black as sackcloth see same
[45:56] thing these happenings of nature
[45:58] look at that word nature what is it what
[46:01] when nature happens like this
[46:04] has been god calling israel
[46:07] right all right he called him out of
[46:09] bondage
[46:12] with these this interruption of nature
[46:14] amen
[46:15] all right so god calling out israel
[46:18] now here he is bringing them out of the
[46:20] roman hands now he's
[46:22] over 144 000 now yeah right because he
[46:24] brought him out of egypt then
[46:26] now he's bringing them out of the hands
[46:27] of the romans now here he is bringing
[46:29] them out of the roman hands
[46:31] where they've made their covenant same
[46:33] thing happens that's the plague
[46:35] the time that this plague will call
[46:38] they'll plague this group of gentiles
[46:40] right so the gentiles why why are the
[46:44] gentiles going to be
[46:47] plagued they turned down their prophet
[46:51] right anywhere in the bible you see
[46:55] anybody turn down a prophet that's
[46:58] judgment
[46:59] right united states turn brother brown
[47:02] them down turn the prophet of the end
[47:03] time down so
[47:04] judgment that's what he says they'll
[47:06] play this group of gentiles
[47:08] right see the time that this plane will
[47:10] call
[47:11] they'll plague this group of gentiles
[47:13] because what plagues israel
[47:16] the rejecting of the two prophets right
[47:19] that's what causes their purging so
[47:22] so i i don't understand these people
[47:24] that are that are rejecting brother
[47:26] brown
[47:26] because i don't see nothing but plagues
[47:28] right you're right
[47:29] i don't see nothing but plagues to fall
[47:30] on them right right right
[47:33] you turn brother branham down as being
[47:35] the prophet of the end time and being
[47:36] the
[47:37] the mouthpiece of god
[47:40] you bring the plagues of the book down
[47:41] around right
[47:43] so that's what i told him i told brother
[47:46] gerald hughes the other day
[47:47] um we um online brother bob black sent
[47:52] that
[47:52] uh email about the man named sirenthius
[47:55] who preached or was that he was a
[47:56] gnostic
[47:58] during the time of polycarp and he was
[48:01] preaching that jesus wouldn't go out to
[48:02] the river jordan i mean he preached the
[48:04] same thing that they're preaching now
[48:06] two thousand years ago and then john the
[48:08] revelator found out he was in the same
[48:11] house with this ceremonies guy
[48:13] runs out of the bath house and says i
[48:15] don't even want to get be caught
[48:17] in the same house with this guy
[48:20] because he's a deceiver of the people
[48:23] right right
[48:24] right that's the plane right
[48:28] that's the plague that'll fall all right
[48:30] now
[48:32] let's go to number five and the sixth
[48:35] seal back again
[48:36] now look see here god is about to
[48:38] deliver his son israel
[48:40] after the same manner of the tribulation
[48:43] that he did down there
[48:44] moses see he sent moses down there and
[48:47] delivered israel is that right
[48:49] and he done these very same things
[48:52] what did he do turned the river to blood
[48:54] he brought locust he
[48:56] he brought darkness that's right all the
[48:58] things
[48:59] he sent elijah they have right purging a
[49:02] group of people what he purged
[49:04] 7 000 people came out amen 7 000 people
[49:08] quit doing what they were doing
[49:09] and followed god's word right
[49:13] all right you see a pattern here
[49:16] you see a pattern god's always been able
[49:20] to purge a group of people
[49:21] out of purging nature amen that's why
[49:24] that struck my heart the other day god
[49:26] delivered his people using nature
[49:30] nature's what we fell and then nature
[49:32] fell so god's using nature to bring us
[49:34] back right right to bring us back
[49:37] and that sick seal is exactly what it's
[49:39] doing that's it look
[49:41] he sent elijah to ahab and 7 000 came
[49:44] out is that right
[49:45] he sends him right back over here again
[49:47] in the time of the tribulation and calls
[49:49] out the 144 thousand
[49:50] what he purged the group of 144 000 you
[49:54] you read it sunday
[49:56] about what he he took and and brought
[49:58] out a group of people
[49:59] right all right now see you notice
[50:02] between revelation or between the sixth
[50:04] chapter or the sixth plague seal pardon
[50:06] me
[50:07] between the sixth c and the seventh seal
[50:09] the seventh chapter of revelation
[50:10] mathematically set together right yeah
[50:13] you see what he's talking about right
[50:15] revelation six
[50:17] the seventh seal doesn't open to
[50:19] revelations eight one right revelation
[50:21] seven
[50:21] is what bringing in what brother dale
[50:23] was told until today bringing in
[50:25] the tribes and boy i really enjoyed that
[50:27] that really answered a big question of
[50:29] mine he and i were talking about the
[50:30] other day
[50:31] but it really helped me to understand
[50:34] why those certain tribe went in certain
[50:37] tribe went out
[50:38] right certain tribe went ahead and
[50:39] traveled with there well
[50:42] god didn't give the promise to joseph's
[50:44] two kids
[50:46] he gave the promise to jacob's 12
[50:48] children right
[50:49] and those 12 children which included
[50:51] levi and dan see remember ephraim and
[50:54] manassas i wondered how they got swapped
[50:56] there i mean got split
[50:58] because dan and ephraim was taken out
[51:00] right
[51:02] but you see dan back in
[51:05] at one time over there and dan and
[51:07] ephraim's back in but where's manasseh
[51:10] but you see that when we go to that city
[51:13] and look at that gate
[51:14] you're going to have 12 gates and
[51:17] they're going to be jacob's kids
[51:18] amen not joseph kids jacob's kids
[51:22] and that makes your 12 which is levi and
[51:24] joseph
[51:25] perfect just the words perfect you know
[51:28] that okay
[51:28] right all right number six
[51:32] on the sixth seal if that is so now we
[51:34] for we know
[51:36] that this sixth seal is the judgment
[51:38] seal
[51:40] so god when god said this that's what
[51:42] struck me
[51:43] when god said i'll put enmity what is
[51:45] enmity
[51:46] division i'll put a division between
[51:50] me and you because we're all born
[51:54] that serpent seed so there was a
[51:56] division
[51:57] but i'm going to come and and breach
[52:00] that gap
[52:01] right i'm going to breach that gap back
[52:06] because god and adam could stand side by
[52:08] side adam didn't have to be purged
[52:10] right right he could just walk right up
[52:13] the guard i'm talking about man
[52:15] right now why didn't he do that brother
[52:17] robbie why didn't he do that after he
[52:18] said i'm afraid
[52:21] after what happened in the fall god said
[52:22] where are you adam he said i'm over here
[52:24] but i was afraid
[52:26] right what was he afraid of something
[52:28] had come between him and god
[52:30] amen so god said okay i'll use that gap
[52:35] called sin to keep you from coming to me
[52:37] but i'll make a way
[52:39] i'll make a way because he purged
[52:41] himself at calvary
[52:43] right right that's the woman's seed
[52:45] genesis 3 15 i'll put enmity
[52:48] between thy seed and the seed of the
[52:49] woman and then i'll put this thing back
[52:52] together in the other word in other
[52:53] words
[52:54] but look the sixth seal is the judgment
[52:56] seal it's a judgment seal exactly what
[52:58] it is right
[53:00] now here is the breaking forth of the
[53:02] judgment upon the people
[53:04] where out of this tribulation judgment
[53:06] will come forth 144
[53:08] 000 redeemed jews right
[53:12] all right i'll prove that they're jews
[53:13] somebody probably you know a lot of
[53:15] people thought the hundred forty four
[53:16] thousand was
[53:17] the bride or gentiles and no it has
[53:20] nothing to do with that
[53:21] 144 000 is 12 000 from 12 tribes right
[53:25] that's 144 thousand all right for some
[53:28] of you maybe that
[53:29] that that's new that's okay now notice
[53:32] for the sixth seal is the judgment
[53:34] seal of the word my brother don't read
[53:35] this one too it's the judgment seal of
[53:37] the word so it's not just in revelation
[53:39] six
[53:40] verse 16 or whatever it is that's not
[53:43] when the sixth seal starts
[53:45] sure that's when it breaks forth in its
[53:48] fullness as the book of revelation
[53:50] but god is starting to purge people
[53:52] since he said i'll put enmity there
[53:54] i'll put division in other words i'm
[53:56] going to purge this earth
[53:58] remember what he said brother brown said
[54:00] god's program
[54:02] god's program is to bring us back right
[54:05] it's his job
[54:08] it's his job to do it he said he was
[54:10] going to do that right
[54:13] because he's got some lost kids out
[54:14] there that that needs to be found
[54:16] right he's got an earth that he don't
[54:19] like this earth to be in the condition
[54:21] that's why he can't come down here in a
[54:24] physical form that's why the millennium
[54:27] is for him to come down here with us but
[54:29] it's after
[54:30] the purging of the earth is the last
[54:33] thing
[54:34] right to be purged okay
[54:38] the earth so he can do what step his
[54:40] foot on it
[54:41] so there's still even a division there
[54:44] and i was telling brother donnie it you
[54:47] say well
[54:48] what about people let me make this
[54:50] statement and don't get me wrong
[54:51] the people that have dead i have died
[54:53] and went on
[54:55] they've went through their purging
[54:58] because we plant them in corruption
[55:03] and we raise them in what right oh
[55:08] really so there's their purging
[55:12] right they have to go back into the
[55:14] earth and as god
[55:15] purges the earth he purges them
[55:20] this purging i'm talking about is live
[55:22] people though
[55:24] right remember that this is live people
[55:27] that's right god's purging live people
[55:29] right not dead people
[55:31] if you die and go on brother tom has
[55:33] been purged
[55:36] done what else is there left
[55:39] god purged him he gave him the baptism
[55:41] of the holy ghost and purged his soul
[55:44] but the curse of the fall took him down
[55:46] to the ground
[55:48] incorrupt in corruption not
[55:50] incorruptible
[55:51] in the corruption he's in the earth
[55:54] right
[55:55] but when he comes back up he's going to
[55:56] be purged amen that's right
[55:59] so what does death do to a christian
[56:01] purges
[56:03] it purges the old man right i was
[56:05] telling somebody the other day we're
[56:06] going to be changed the bible says i'm
[56:07] changing the moment twinkling woman eye
[56:10] remember the original says changed in
[56:11] the atoms right
[56:14] where are we falling our atoms is what's
[56:16] killing us
[56:18] because in a fallen condition but when
[56:21] we're changed in the atoms
[56:24] we're purged we're done there's our body
[56:27] there's the cleansing so just remember
[56:30] that there's got to be this group that
[56:31] we're talking about now
[56:33] is a live group of people right because
[56:36] even the foolish
[56:37] version we'll talk about in just a
[56:38] minute has got to be purged
[56:41] they're going to have to be killed but
[56:43] they're going to go through a
[56:44] tribulation
[56:46] to purge them right then they're going
[56:48] to die
[56:49] the 144 000 is going to go through a
[56:52] purging
[56:53] then they're going to die but now
[56:55] remember because of the opening of the
[56:57] seals
[56:58] there's a group of people praise the
[57:01] lord
[57:02] that's right it's going to go through a
[57:04] purging and not die
[57:06] amen that's right because they're going
[57:08] to be changed in the moment in the 20th
[57:10] of an eye
[57:11] right here amen but we got to take these
[57:13] seals and we got to take all the plan of
[57:15] redemption and apply it
[57:18] i said apply it right
[57:24] you know jesus died at calvary it proves
[57:27] everything
[57:28] amen right everything right even the
[57:31] jews
[57:32] sure right but they rejected it we
[57:34] accepted it
[57:35] right right all right we'll just hold
[57:39] that for just
[57:40] thought for just a second we'll get to
[57:41] it all right where are we at
[57:43] now notice the sixth seal is the
[57:45] judgment seal of the word
[57:46] so every time we read the word
[57:52] that sixth seal is opening up to you
[57:54] amen
[57:55] that seal is being made known to you
[57:58] that you need
[57:59] this because of this amen
[58:03] that's why that's why pharaoh said
[58:07] go he knew if he kept that group of
[58:11] people there
[58:12] he wasn't going to have anything left
[58:15] and that's what the devil
[58:16] same thing with the devil one day he's
[58:20] going to have to let us go
[58:22] amen he's the only one that's got us
[58:24] bound
[58:25] right between our ears
[58:28] there's the enmity that's the division
[58:30] is about the eight inches
[58:32] or bless his heart brother claus is
[58:34] about 12 inches between his ears he got
[58:36] just a big head
[58:38] but he's going to have to purge that
[58:41] group of people
[58:42] so much the word we're going to have to
[58:46] remember brother brown said i want to be
[58:48] so close and wrapped up in god
[58:50] right yes that satan doesn't know what
[58:52] to do with me right right now that's a
[58:54] purging
[58:55] that's the purging time that's when we
[58:57] come to a spot where
[58:58] when the devil don't know what to do
[59:00] because he knows what to do with you
[59:01] he'll kill you
[59:03] right you don't know what to do he'll
[59:05] just kill you right
[59:06] he can't touch the soul but he knows he
[59:08] can kill that guy
[59:09] right because he's got a claim on it
[59:12] right but we gotta see here
[59:14] that how this sixth seal purges that
[59:16] claim of israel
[59:19] because god told them i mean they told
[59:21] themselves they said let his blood be on
[59:22] us and our children
[59:23] that's right right exactly in other
[59:25] words they
[59:26] they basically cut their self off from
[59:29] redemption
[59:31] right but god said
[59:36] father forgive them
[59:40] for they know not what they did right
[59:43] so the purging started with israel
[59:47] think of ad70 titus is like it's like
[59:50] claude said actually
[59:51] titus's father is the one that encircled
[59:55] israel
[59:55] yeah and and they were there for so long
[59:58] they sent him back to
[1:00:00] to uh wherever he was in rome and made
[1:00:03] him an
[1:00:03] emperor and his son titus which was a
[1:00:06] mean guy
[1:00:08] he's the one that finished the job
[1:00:12] he's the one that went in and took over
[1:00:14] because the people of israel were so
[1:00:16] stubborn
[1:00:16] they thought god was still with them
[1:00:18] when he had already left
[1:00:20] because they had what they called
[1:00:21] judgment on themselves right
[1:00:23] because jesus said don't be in the city
[1:00:25] don't be in the city when this happens
[1:00:27] don't be here when it's happening don't
[1:00:28] do this when it's out
[1:00:29] he was preaching to him he was telling
[1:00:31] them don't do it right yeah dudes and
[1:00:32] don't sorry
[1:00:34] amen they're there somewhere
[1:00:37] yeah there's a lot of grace but there is
[1:00:39] some do's and don'ts in there right all
[1:00:40] right
[1:00:41] but what's the sixth seal doing that is
[1:00:43] purging the old man

[1:01:49] both with wrath and fierce anger to lay
[1:01:51] the land desolate
[1:01:52] and he shall destroy the sinners thereof
[1:01:55] out of it
[1:01:56] purging amen purging right
[1:02:00] god's getting rid of the drops he's
[1:02:02] getting rid of the old you
[1:02:04] i hope you're seeing the spiritual part
[1:02:06] of this all right
[1:02:08] for the stars of heaven and the
[1:02:10] constellations thereof shall not give
[1:02:12] their life

[1:02:42] the arrogant people that's the one that
[1:02:43] said hey that's no problem we're okay
[1:02:45] but when they see those plays coming
[1:02:47] down
[1:02:49] and they hear even not even see those
[1:02:51] two prophets if they hear that there's
[1:02:53] two men
[1:02:54] that's just absolutely when they just
[1:02:56] move their hand
[1:02:58] an earthquake happens just drops a whole
[1:03:00] city down in it
[1:03:02] right you think they're going to be
[1:03:05] arrogant and proud then
[1:03:06] i don't think so but i will cause the
[1:03:08] arrogancy of the proud deceased i will
[1:03:10] lay low the hardness of the terrible
[1:03:13] i will make a man more precious than
[1:03:15] find gold now what's he doing
[1:03:16] he's going to bring somebody out of this
[1:03:21] god's not just going to waste his place
[1:03:24] he's always brought something or
[1:03:26] somebody out of something
[1:03:28] all right i will make a man more
[1:03:30] precious than find gold even a man than
[1:03:32] the golden wedge of offer
[1:03:35] therefore i will shake the heavens and
[1:03:37] the earth shall remove out of her place
[1:03:42] what the earth is going to do what turn
[1:03:45] right back up on its axis again
[1:03:47] right and who can do that
[1:03:51] god all right therefore i will shake the
[1:03:55] heavens and the earth shall remove out
[1:03:57] of her place in the wrath of the lord of
[1:03:58] hosts
[1:03:59] and in the day of his fierce anger so
[1:04:02] see there's a sick seal there
[1:04:04] in isaiah brother brown said i don't
[1:04:06] know if it's this quote or one coming up
[1:04:07] let's go to number seven
[1:04:09] excuse me yeah see
[1:04:12] even in the sixth seal and look 13th
[1:04:14] chapter of isaiah let's begin here at
[1:04:15] the sixth verse now we're going to read
[1:04:17] this again
[1:04:18] how ye for the day of the lord is at
[1:04:19] hand it shall come as a destruction with
[1:04:21] the almighty
[1:04:22] watch this sixth seal opening up here
[1:04:24] now
[1:04:25] plumb back here 713 years before christ
[1:04:29] even come on the earth
[1:04:31] he's been 2 000 years that'd be about
[1:04:34] seven about
[1:04:35] 2700 years ago isaiah seen this seal
[1:04:38] hanging there
[1:04:41] now we know it breaks in its natural
[1:04:43] form over here again in israel
[1:04:45] but it's being spoken of all down
[1:04:47] through the ages and all down to the
[1:04:49] scriptures
[1:04:50] therefore shall all hands be faint every
[1:04:52] man's heart shall melt what did jesus
[1:04:54] say
[1:04:54] and because iniquity shall abound the
[1:04:56] love of many shall wax them
[1:04:58] and man's hearts will be failing for
[1:04:59] fear see a roaring man's hearts will
[1:05:01] faint
[1:05:01] now he reads all that go down to the
[1:05:03] bottom
[1:05:04] see there just exactly isaiah saw the
[1:05:07] same
[1:05:08] thing that jesus spoke of that the
[1:05:10] seventh seal
[1:05:11] reveals when he's cleansing the land
[1:05:14] with tribulations
[1:05:16] that's the tribulation period this sixth
[1:05:18] seal yes he was a prophet
[1:05:20] and the word of god was made known to
[1:05:22] him that's 2700 years ago
[1:05:24] amen brother brown was trying to tell
[1:05:26] the people that the sixth seal
[1:05:28] it's going to open in its pure form over
[1:05:30] there but it's being shown all the way
[1:05:32] through
[1:05:32] them right since the book of genesis
[1:05:34] first seal has been shown all the way
[1:05:36] through since the book
[1:05:37] of genesis second seal all the way
[1:05:39] through the book of genesis
[1:05:41] all right and i don't know where brother
[1:05:43] raised that in that but you know dad
[1:05:44] preached after he preached the seals he
[1:05:46] preached the seals in the ages the seals
[1:05:48] and genesis and he preached the seals
[1:05:49] coming down through there
[1:05:50] in other forms other than just one two
[1:05:53] three four five six seven right
[1:05:54] but you see here that

[1:06:52] heavy upon it
[1:06:54] and it shall fall and not rise again it
[1:06:57] shall come to pass in that day that the
[1:06:59] lord shall
[1:07:00] punish the hosts of the high ones that
[1:07:02] are on high and the kings of the earth
[1:07:03] upon the earth
[1:07:04] and they shall be gathered together as
[1:07:06] prisoners are gathered in the pit and

[1:08:08] and all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:08:10] we've turned everyone to his own way the
[1:08:12] lord has laid on us the iniquity laid on
[1:08:14] him
[1:08:15] the iniquity remember make an end of sin
[1:08:20] transgression remember the sixth full
[1:08:22] purpose iniquity those words
[1:08:24] and the sexual purpose what's he doing
[1:08:27] all we got she's
[1:08:28] going straight we've turned everyone
[1:08:29] around the lord hath laid on him the
[1:08:30] iniquity of us he didn't have any
[1:08:33] but he had ours right he was oppressed
[1:08:36] he was afflicted yet open on his mouth
[1:08:38] he brought us a lamb to the slaughter
[1:08:40] and there's a sheep before shears down
[1:08:41] so he opened on his mouth
[1:08:42] he was taken from prison and from
[1:08:44] judgment
[1:08:46] keep scrolling up please
[1:08:54] okay for he was cut off remember we
[1:08:57] preached on who shall declare his
[1:08:58] generation
[1:09:00] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:09:01] living for the transgression of my
[1:09:03] people
[1:09:04] was he stricken what's god doing he's
[1:09:07] purging a son
[1:09:09] he's purging a son to be able to deliver
[1:09:12] a group of people right and he made his
[1:09:14] grave with the wicked and with a rich in
[1:09:16] his death because he had done no
[1:09:17] violence neither was any deceit in his
[1:09:18] mouth
[1:09:19] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he
[1:09:22] put him to grief when he shall make his
[1:09:23] soul and offering for sin
[1:09:25] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[1:09:28] his days and the pleasure of the lord
[1:09:29] shall prosper in his hand he shall see
[1:09:30] the travail of his soul and shall be
[1:09:32] satisfied
[1:09:33] for by his knowledge shall my righteous
[1:09:35] servant
[1:09:36] justify amen many for he shall bear
[1:09:40] their iniquities glory see look
[1:09:43] therefore i would divide him a portion
[1:09:45] with the great and he shall divide the
[1:09:47] spoil with a strong
[1:09:48] because he had poured out his soul unto
[1:09:51] death
[1:09:52] and he was numbered with the
[1:09:53] transgressor but he wasn't a
[1:09:54] transgressor he was numbered with the
[1:09:56] transgressor
[1:09:57] and he bear the sin of many and made
[1:09:59] intercession
[1:10:01] for the transgressor does that seem
[1:10:04] familiar over there in daniel 9.
[1:10:06] amen all of that he's doing is he's
[1:10:08] taking his people
[1:10:10] and he's purging his group of people
[1:10:13] that didn't want him to transgressed
[1:10:15] they sinned they
[1:10:16] they they uh caused iniquity and all
[1:10:20] those things but god said hey
[1:10:21] i'm not worried about that i'm gonna
[1:10:23] give you my soul a ransom
[1:10:25] so that i'll see my seed in other words
[1:10:26] my blood is gonna be poured out for you
[1:10:28] now let's go to matthew 24 29
[1:10:32] immediately after the tribulation of
[1:10:34] those days shall the sun be darkened and
[1:10:36] the moon shall not give her light
[1:10:37] the scars shall fall from heaven is this
[1:10:39] all familiar
[1:10:40] we've been talking about it all evening
[1:10:42] all right and the stars shall fall from
[1:10:44] heaven now watch
[1:10:45] what's this brother goes back to matthew
[1:10:47] 24 and shows that brother brown preached
[1:10:49] six seals
[1:10:50] all right and here's the number six
[1:10:52] right here that i think brother dale
[1:10:54] read it last sunday
[1:10:55] and the starship all from heaven and the
[1:10:57] powers of the heavens shall be shaken
[1:11:00] now from the sixth hour there was
[1:11:01] darkness over all the land
[1:11:03] until the ninth hour now this was after
[1:11:05] the crucifixion this is matthew 27
[1:11:07] 45. this is when god was purging his son
[1:11:11] right all right god was purging his son
[1:11:14] at calvary we know he fought it out in
[1:11:16] the garden but he had to go to calvary
[1:11:19] that's where he really had to be in
[1:11:22] control
[1:11:23] right he was he was in control of
[1:11:26] everything
[1:11:27] amen he said into my hands i command my
[1:11:29] spirit
[1:11:30] he wasn't killed he gave his life right
[1:11:33] okay
[1:11:33] all right matthew 27 51 and behold the
[1:11:36] veil of the temple was renting twain
[1:11:38] from the top to the bottom and the earth
[1:11:40] did quake in the rocks rent
[1:11:42] so brother brown said there was the
[1:11:43] judgment seal there was a sixth seal
[1:11:46] there's calvary
[1:11:48] and you know we've heard it preached
[1:11:50] many times before that
[1:11:52] a six seal calvary is a purging that
[1:11:54] purged his body
[1:11:55] that purged him yeah right right all
[1:11:58] right so now let's go to
[1:11:59] number eight six seal go back again
[1:12:04] he was now hanging on the cross at three
[1:12:06] o'clock on good friday afternoon just
[1:12:08] about to take place matthew 27th
[1:12:10] chapter of matthew in the 45th verse i
[1:12:12] just read that
[1:12:13] all right blackness darkness egypt
[1:12:16] blackness darkness
[1:12:17] god delivering jesus at the cross just
[1:12:20] before he brought him
[1:12:22] up from the resurrection first darkness
[1:12:24] sun went down in the middle of the day
[1:12:26] and stars wouldn't shine
[1:12:27] two days from then he was going to raise
[1:12:29] him up with a mighty trump
[1:12:31] after the sun moon and stars and
[1:12:33] everything in egypt all these taking
[1:12:35] place he delivered israel
[1:12:37] to the promised land now what he's going
[1:12:39] to do now he's going to deliver
[1:12:40] israel 144 000 he's going to deliver
[1:12:43] them into the millennium
[1:12:45] all right he's going to deliver them
[1:12:46] he's going to purge them so much
[1:12:49] until they're going to be in the
[1:12:50] millennium with a group of people that
[1:12:52] was already purged
[1:12:55] us yeah right we're not given white
[1:12:58] robes
[1:13:00] there we're giving white robes tonight
[1:13:02] if you're born again you've got a white
[1:13:04] robe
[1:13:04] all right and you're protected glory
[1:13:08] in your soul you're protected satan
[1:13:10] can't get to you
[1:13:12] but he still can get to this thing right
[1:13:14] here because it's corruptible right
[1:13:15] right
[1:13:17] is no corruption in god glory there's no
[1:13:19] corruption in his word
[1:13:21] right that's why these people try to say
[1:13:23] that
[1:13:25] the word is fallible or or that's what
[1:13:28] they're trying to say even when they say
[1:13:29] jesus made mistakes and made slips of
[1:13:31] the tongue and brother brandon made
[1:13:32] slips as dumb
[1:13:33] they're saying they're fallible that the
[1:13:34] word's fallible yeah
[1:13:36] the word is infallible right period
[1:13:39] right i ain't arguing with nobody about
[1:13:41] that
[1:13:42] unlike the bath house incident you start
[1:13:44] talking about fallibility of the message
[1:13:45] i'm leaving
[1:13:46] right now amen amen
[1:13:50] that's a good judgment for me to be
[1:13:51] purged from right
[1:13:53] because i don't want to be you know what
[1:13:54] john was saying i don't want to be in
[1:13:56] the same house if god decides to strike
[1:13:58] that man
[1:13:58] i don't want to be in the same house
[1:14:00] with him that's what he was saying right
[1:14:02] they were in a bathhouse together
[1:14:04] and he went running out and said i'll
[1:14:06] not be in the same house with that man
[1:14:10] no we gotta love everybody yeah
[1:14:14] that wasn't a lot of love involved there
[1:14:17] all right
[1:14:18] so now now listen listen to me for a
[1:14:21] minute god redeemed everything at
[1:14:23] calvary right
[1:14:24] right amen but now listen he applied it
[1:14:28] as it was accepted
[1:14:33] one more time he applied it as it was
[1:14:37] accepted
[1:14:38] right if not the rapture would have took
[1:14:40] place when the dead saints
[1:14:42] raised out of the ground right right but
[1:14:44] he applied it as it was accepted
[1:14:47] the pardon purged that man
[1:14:50] if he would have accepted that pardon it
[1:14:53] would have purged him from killing the
[1:14:55] man
[1:14:56] right because the pardon sign
[1:14:59] said release the man
[1:15:03] purge him from anything he had done
[1:15:06] before
[1:15:07] but he when he didn't accept that
[1:15:11] he had to stand exactly on what he was
[1:15:15] right a murderer and they shot him the
[1:15:18] next day
[1:15:19] right same way with you and i pardon's
[1:15:22] not a pardon until it's accepted as a
[1:15:23] pardon you accept the pardon
[1:15:26] then that purges you from what you've
[1:15:28] done
[1:15:31] right right and covers you but see the
[1:15:34] jews rejected that
[1:15:36] they rejected that pardon at calvary
[1:15:40] but so that god could blind the eyes of
[1:15:43] his own children like we
[1:15:45] were being going into now but i want to
[1:15:47] show you a little something
[1:15:48] because the gentiles accepted it
[1:15:52] and how are we purged
[1:15:55] because it's going to be where maybe
[1:15:57] we'll have time to get into it but
[1:15:58] we have been in the feast of pentecost
[1:16:00] all down through the church ages
[1:16:02] right we've been in the feast of
[1:16:04] pentecost all the way down he's dealing
[1:16:06] with the gentiles
[1:16:08] amen sure we know the jews came in right
[1:16:10] there at first 120 and 3
[1:16:12] 000 but he turned to the gentiles
[1:16:15] and began to give them the holy ghost
[1:16:18] because what's the feast of pentecost
[1:16:19] at the feast of pentecost is when they
[1:16:21] received the holy ghost right when the
[1:16:22] day of pentecost was fully come
[1:16:24] right they were in the upper room you
[1:16:26] understand we're in the scripture here
[1:16:27] but the gentiles accepted it but how are
[1:16:30] we purged
[1:16:32] it's the purging of our old nature yeah
[1:16:36] very elementary but we got to see that
[1:16:38] the same persian that god purged the
[1:16:40] earth with
[1:16:43] and it's not that oh when 14 earthquakes
[1:16:46] begin to happen
[1:16:47] we need to get ready
[1:16:50] no or when
[1:16:54] we got this happen or or that happened
[1:16:56] sure we know things happen for a purpose
[1:16:58] to drive us to the homeland we know that
[1:17:01] but we don't need to wait until
[1:17:02] california sinks and then try to get
[1:17:04] ready
[1:17:06] right that's why we come to church on
[1:17:09] sunday it's why we come to church on
[1:17:10] wednesday we're being purged
[1:17:12] amen just like i said many times before
[1:17:16] and i know some of you can't make church
[1:17:18] on wednesday and i know some of you
[1:17:19] can't make every sunday
[1:17:21] but you miss a visitation from all the
[1:17:23] almighty man
[1:17:25] if you miss church if i'm sick this is
[1:17:27] where i want to be
[1:17:29] this is where god promised he'd visit me
[1:17:31] i don't know that he promised he visited
[1:17:33] me at my house i know he said i'll be
[1:17:34] right here at ten and two on sunday
[1:17:36] and it's seven on wednesday night right
[1:17:39] so if you want to go where god
[1:17:40] is you need to be right here right you
[1:17:42] sure well god's with me all the time
[1:17:44] that's true but he promised he'd be
[1:17:45] right here
[1:17:46] right where two or three are gathered
[1:17:48] together in my name there i'll be in the
[1:17:49] midst
[1:17:49] all right so anyway i picked up on
[1:17:52] something
[1:17:52] and i forgot about this when i owned the
[1:17:54] seafood company
[1:17:56] we had a little thing that we would get
[1:17:57] from louisiana called the crawfish
[1:18:00] or some of you want to call it a
[1:18:02] crayfish
[1:18:05] it's c-r-a-w it's craw
[1:18:09] it's not cra that's crayfish it's
[1:18:12] crawfish
[1:18:14] or claude call it crawdaddy yeah
[1:18:17] but the story of the crawfish goes like
[1:18:19] this
[1:18:21] we used to buy them in 30 pound richard
[1:18:24] do you remember about getting those
[1:18:25] things you know it was before richard's
[1:18:27] time
[1:18:28] back when we first started jng poultry
[1:18:29] and seafood we
[1:18:31] we merged the seafood company in with us
[1:18:33] but we didn't know
[1:18:34] deadly about seafood we knew that it
[1:18:38] smelled like fish look like fish so it
[1:18:39] must
[1:18:40] be fish that's all we knew so stan
[1:18:43] started getting
[1:18:43] we get this truck backed up one day and
[1:18:46] josiah there's this big old thing like
[1:18:47] this
[1:18:48] and it's it's mesh and they threw it up
[1:18:52] on the dock
[1:18:54] and the thing started moving
[1:18:58] this little red bag and started moving
[1:19:02] and you could hear something clicking
[1:19:05] and i looked down and it was about 5 000
[1:19:09] crawfish about that big
[1:19:11] from louisiana now crawfish is a special
[1:19:14] animal crawfish lives in
[1:19:18] brackish water or salt water
[1:19:21] in the bayous of louisiana
[1:19:26] and they're bottom suckers so were you
[1:19:32] right and they suck up
[1:19:36] mud and that's they get
[1:19:40] their nourishment out of the little
[1:19:41] plankton and stuff that's in that mud
[1:19:44] so they suck that mud up into their
[1:19:46] stomach
[1:19:49] well what you have to do is you have to
[1:19:51] purge him before you eat him
[1:19:55] so what do you do you change from where
[1:19:59] he was
[1:20:01] to where he's going to be yeah you take
[1:20:03] him out of that salt water and that real
[1:20:05] warm salt water and you put him in a tub
[1:20:10] of good fresh cold
[1:20:13] water and the first thing he does
[1:20:19] he burps all that mud up
[1:20:24] yep it's called purging
[1:20:28] you have to purge that crawfish before
[1:20:31] you can eat
[1:20:32] him yeah but you have to take him from
[1:20:34] what his old nature was
[1:20:37] in the things of the world and the water
[1:20:40] that was salt that he was real warm and
[1:20:42] had a real good time out there drinking
[1:20:43] smoking gambling running around doing
[1:20:44] all the things
[1:20:46] that a crawfish does and you take and
[1:20:49] change
[1:20:51] his position amen yeah
[1:20:55] and what does it do it purges it
[1:20:59] you give him some water of the word
[1:21:02] right you give him some good fresh clean
[1:21:04] water he's not used to that
[1:21:06] he's used to eating mud he's used to
[1:21:08] eating all that old junk inside there
[1:21:10] but if you put him in good clean water
[1:21:13] first thing he does he starts throwing
[1:21:14] up
[1:21:15] all that junk of the world that's right
[1:21:16] he starts throwing all that stuff up and
[1:21:18] that's what you call it you call it
[1:21:20] purging crawfish
[1:21:21] you take that whole bag and you put it
[1:21:23] down in water in a in a tub
[1:21:25] and it's good old clean water but you
[1:21:27] know what about 15 minutes later
[1:21:30] it's dark and muddy and grungy
[1:21:34] so you have to take it out shake it off
[1:21:35] put them in another batch of water
[1:21:37] until the water is pretty clean then you
[1:21:40] can eat the crawfish
[1:21:41] that's the same thing what god did with
[1:21:42] you and i right man yeah we were an old
[1:21:44] crawfish that had a good time where we
[1:21:46] were at
[1:21:47] and we loved the water that we were in
[1:21:49] and we loved all that
[1:21:51] mud and junk that we loved before right
[1:21:54] but when god took us and put us in
[1:21:55] another place
[1:21:59] he changed our nature amen it purged our
[1:22:03] old nature
[1:22:04] to make us to where god could use us
[1:22:06] amen but i thought about the story of
[1:22:08] the crawfish just something to help you
[1:22:11] to see that what god has done to a group
[1:22:14] of gentiles and that's what he's done
[1:22:16] amen he took us out of the world and he
[1:22:18] put us in some good fresh clean
[1:22:20] environments and good fresh clean water
[1:22:23] what clean people man i hate
[1:22:27] getting the grunge of the world on me
[1:22:29] don't you
[1:22:30] i hate it sure i love to to do things
[1:22:33] with people and
[1:22:34] and all but man there's a time when i
[1:22:36] want to go with that stuff off
[1:22:38] right i want that stuff purge you know
[1:22:40] what every once in a while
[1:22:42] i might just get another gulf of mud
[1:22:45] because i'm still a crawfish right
[1:22:48] but god does what he just takes a little
[1:22:51] more
[1:22:51] good cold fresh water of the word throws
[1:22:55] me in it
[1:22:55] yeah holds my head under he says throw
[1:22:58] it up boy
[1:22:59] right throw it up i know it's in there
[1:23:01] throw it up all right
[1:23:03] and that's exactly what god done and
[1:23:05] that's what he's doing even to the
[1:23:07] to the jews because he's going to take
[1:23:09] 144 000 let's go back to daniel 9
[1:23:11] 24 and bring all that down to here to
[1:23:16] where we can see that
[1:23:18] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[1:23:20] now he's going to purge a people in a
[1:23:22] city
[1:23:23] because of their what because of their
[1:23:25] transgression right
[1:23:26] because of their sin and because of
[1:23:29] their iniquity they got their self into
[1:23:30] this place
[1:23:32] and then the city got desecrated
[1:23:35] right because the mosque of omar's
[1:23:37] sitting over there now they're gonna
[1:23:38] have to wipe that thing off they're
[1:23:40] gonna have to purge that mosque off of
[1:23:41] there
[1:23:42] for them to build that city in the
[1:23:43] millennium you're not gonna see a little
[1:23:45] moscow omar sitting up in the millennium
[1:23:47] no that thing's going to be blown to
[1:23:49] pieces right
[1:23:50] they're going to wipe what they're going
[1:23:52] to purge that thing off
[1:23:54] so that they can build a real temple
[1:23:55] there because that's where the temple is
[1:23:57] going to be
[1:23:57] right there all right to finish the
[1:24:00] transgression make an end of sins make
[1:24:01] reconciliation for iniquity
[1:24:03] bring in everlasting righteousness now
[1:24:05] after the purging is over
[1:24:09] that's what it's going to bring in
[1:24:11] that's what
[1:24:13] brother tim calhoun called me a couple
[1:24:15] days ago and he said i see it i said i
[1:24:17] said what do you say
[1:24:19] he said i see that that 70 weeks of
[1:24:22] daniel has to
[1:24:24] lap over into the millennium glory
[1:24:27] because right here here's where the
[1:24:30] reconciliation of iniquity
[1:24:32] this is where israel is restored the
[1:24:35] people
[1:24:36] right yeah that's right then there's a
[1:24:39] battle of armageddon right
[1:24:40] right cleansing of the earth purging of
[1:24:44] the earth
[1:24:46] and then bringing everlasting
[1:24:47] righteousness well the way that most
[1:24:48] people have got it in a message
[1:24:50] and look i'm looking right straight at
[1:24:51] you i don't care who you are
[1:24:53] the bible says these six things are
[1:24:55] gonna happen in that 70 weeks of daniel
[1:24:57] right
[1:24:58] every how you put it ever what you think
[1:24:59] the prophet said he didn't say what you
[1:25:01] thought he said
[1:25:03] all right that's right because right
[1:25:04] here israel is finished
[1:25:07] their pursing is finished right here
[1:25:08] right battle of armageddon
[1:25:11] cleans and purges the earth right right
[1:25:14] then
[1:25:14] how are you going to bring an
[1:25:15] everlasting righteousness are they going
[1:25:17] to build a city and then destroyed in
[1:25:18] the battle of armageddon because the way
[1:25:20] the people preaching the message there's
[1:25:21] only three and a half years left of
[1:25:23] 70 weeks of daniel after the rapture
[1:25:27] how can you do that you can't the bible
[1:25:29] didn't say that right
[1:25:30] there's no half weeks in the bible right
[1:25:32] right right there's four weeks
[1:25:34] seventy weeks are determined upon god
[1:25:37] people in the holy city holy city to do
[1:25:39] these six things
[1:25:40] and brother brown said this anointing to
[1:25:41] the most holy is us
[1:25:43] riding back in the millennium right we
[1:25:45] can't ride back in the millennium before
[1:25:47] the battle of armageddon right
[1:25:49] do you see how that they're misplacing
[1:25:51] the word brother brown said don't well
[1:25:54] it didn't help me
[1:25:55] you preached on many times miss place
[1:25:59] dislocate misplace
[1:26:03] this mission thank you i knew you all
[1:26:05] know and i had it written down somewhere
[1:26:07] the other day
[1:26:07] but those three things and if they don't
[1:26:09] do it right then
[1:26:10] that's what brother brown said you're
[1:26:11] going to put the cow eating grass way up
[1:26:13] here
[1:26:15] it's a pretty picture it's a cow
[1:26:18] it's a tree it's green grass
[1:26:22] but the cow's not in the tree and that's
[1:26:24] the same way with the word of god if you
[1:26:26] don't place it right
[1:26:27] now the way the way that that we see it
[1:26:30] now
[1:26:31] is that we see a full picture of
[1:26:33] redemption taking us
[1:26:35] all the way in right all the way into
[1:26:38] the millennium
[1:26:39] completely purged the gentiles
[1:26:43] the 144 000 right even
[1:26:49] the fifth sealed jew
[1:26:52] and the earth right so we don't
[1:26:56] dislocate or misinterpret or any of
[1:26:58] those things
[1:26:59] when you see that there is one week left
[1:27:02] after the rapture
[1:27:03] for the redemption of israel and the
[1:27:05] city
[1:27:06] right nobody understand that amen now
[1:27:08] there's only three and a half years of
[1:27:09] ministry left to do that
[1:27:11] right 1260 days
[1:27:14] in 260 days israel is going to be
[1:27:17] redeemed
[1:27:18] right see that's not redeeming the earth
[1:27:21] right at that time it's beginning to be
[1:27:24] just in stages like we just talked about
[1:27:26] starting from the flood coming all the
[1:27:28] way down to jesus
[1:27:30] now coming down to the full plan of
[1:27:31] redemption finishing on the earth
[1:27:33] all right right everything's going to
[1:27:35] sit back up straight
[1:27:37] the earth's going to be purged off and
[1:27:39] then we're going to be able to right see
[1:27:40] right here
[1:27:42] everything's got to be purged here or he
[1:27:44] can't come down here
[1:27:45] right so revelations 19 21 is when he
[1:27:49] rides
[1:27:49] back with us to rule and reign on the
[1:27:53] earth
[1:27:53] right so that the purging and all has
[1:27:55] got to be finished
[1:27:58] because we know the sixth seal opens
[1:27:59] while the two prophets opened it
[1:28:01] during that 1260 days everybody
[1:28:03] understand that during that 160 days
[1:28:05] the two prophets opened that sixth seal
[1:28:07] they caused this interruption of nature
[1:28:10] that we're talking about interrupting
[1:28:11] our nature but it interrupts the nature
[1:28:14] of the whole earth the jews
[1:28:17] 144 000 and bringing everlasting
[1:28:20] righteousness brother brown said that's
[1:28:21] when satan is sealed in the bottomless
[1:28:23] pit
[1:28:24] well buddy let me tell you something
[1:28:27] that's pretty purged
[1:28:28] yeah now we know the full purging comes
[1:28:31] at the white throne judgment we know
[1:28:33] that when satan is destroyed before he
[1:28:34] even gets there
[1:28:36] but see this is the time for the jews to
[1:28:38] enjoy
[1:28:39] amen us to enjoy our honeymoon right
[1:28:42] right us to enjoy the honeymoon come in
[1:28:45] here to the millennium
[1:28:46] but all this has got to be purged before
[1:28:48] god can step on the earth
[1:28:50] before god can step in this earth we've
[1:28:52] got to be purged
[1:28:53] we can't be the old crawfish that's full
[1:28:55] of mud like we were before
[1:28:57] we got to be a new crawfish right looks
[1:29:00] like a crawfish
[1:29:02] smells like a crawfish acts like a
[1:29:05] crawfish is how we were in the world
[1:29:07] yeah but now we still look like a human
[1:29:10] we act like a human
[1:29:11] but we're not human in the terms that we
[1:29:13] were before right now we've been purged
[1:29:16] we've been changed changed
[1:29:19] amen our change started when we got born
[1:29:22] again
[1:29:23] right right then it works its way out
[1:29:25] all right let's finish right here
[1:29:29] revelation 7
[1:29:32] 3-6 saying hurt not the earth nor the
[1:29:37] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[1:29:38] the servants of our god in their
[1:29:40] foreheads
[1:29:41] and i heard the number of them which
[1:29:42] were sealed and they were sealed in 144
[1:29:47] i'm sorry 140 and 4 000 of
[1:29:50] all the tribes of the children of israel
[1:29:52] other charges of judah and it keeps
[1:29:54] going down through there and it
[1:29:55] it names them all off they are sealed or
[1:29:58] purged all right sealed until the day of
[1:30:01] the redemption
[1:30:02] all right so look as it took a prophet
[1:30:06] to purge us
[1:30:08] when when brother brown brought the word
[1:30:10] he brought it
[1:30:12] not disfigured he didn't bring it
[1:30:14] misinterpreted
[1:30:16] like they say or dislocated he put it
[1:30:20] just
[1:30:20] exactly the way it was supposed why'd he
[1:30:22] say he had to tile them loose ends up
[1:30:24] why
[1:30:25] there was loose ends dangling there was
[1:30:27] things that people didn't understand
[1:30:28] they
[1:30:29] see the book of redemption in god's
[1:30:31] program like we read a minute ago
[1:30:33] god's program runs like this it's not
[1:30:36] broken up and changing his mind and
[1:30:38] changing this
[1:30:39] and changing that god don't change his
[1:30:40] mind this is his program
[1:30:44] there's no gaps in that program but what
[1:30:46] happened is man has
[1:30:48] pulled gaps out of the program and said
[1:30:51] i think it's this
[1:30:53] i think there's only three and a half
[1:30:54] years after the rapture and that's all
[1:30:56] because that's what brother brown said
[1:30:59] that's your opinion
[1:31:00] right he didn't say i was wrong he said
[1:31:03] you didn't understand what i said
[1:31:04] ah man i don't see how they don't get
[1:31:08] that he didn't he never said i was wrong
[1:31:09] he said you didn't understand what i
[1:31:11] said
[1:31:11] right he wasn't changing what he said
[1:31:15] they just didn't understand what he was
[1:31:16] saying all right but thank god for the
[1:31:19] opening of the seals because the opening
[1:31:20] of the seals will bring you back
[1:31:22] glory and show you
[1:31:25] the whole plan of redemption the way
[1:31:27] it's supposed to have been
[1:31:29] and you say well it's not important
[1:31:30] because we're not going to be here
[1:31:33] that sixth seal has to open to you
[1:31:36] just like it opens to those two prophets
[1:31:38] over there or you don't take a body
[1:31:40] change
[1:31:43] you don't take a body change unless that
[1:31:45] six seal opens the same way
[1:31:47] right right because we're dealing with
[1:31:49] our nature
[1:31:50] right right with earthquakes and with
[1:31:54] he said a total interruption of nature
[1:31:55] right your nature
[1:31:57] right now just like the two prophets
[1:31:59] you're going to interrupt nature
[1:32:00] on the earth god is interrupting your
[1:32:02] nature through what
[1:32:03] one prophet brought a message to the
[1:32:05] gentiles and that is doing what it's
[1:32:08] supposed to do
[1:32:08] it is purging your own nature out
[1:32:12] this was never taught things were never
[1:32:13] taught like brother brown taught him
[1:32:16] right sure man probed at him but brother
[1:32:19] brown come and god put that program
[1:32:21] together there's no gaps you know if
[1:32:26] rapture and faith lies in the books and
[1:32:28] tapes
[1:32:29] if there's one error and we know there's
[1:32:33] where brother brown talked about the
[1:32:34] holy ghost being a white horse rider
[1:32:37] and that was something that god
[1:32:39] corrected him on him man
[1:32:41] he said if the holy spirit had to come
[1:32:42] in the room and corrected me
[1:32:44] on what i was going to say right right
[1:32:46] so listen to what i'm saying
[1:32:48] but if you can find a flaw in the
[1:32:49] message then rapture and faith don't
[1:32:50] land in books today
[1:32:51] right right because what
[1:32:54] i've got to put my soul dependency that
[1:32:57] this message is the message
[1:32:59] right not the message of william branham
[1:33:01] but the message of almighty god
[1:33:04] through a man that said 700 meant 7
[1:33:07] 000. but listen the holy spirit is the
[1:33:10] deserter
[1:33:11] the holy ghost is what you're supposed
[1:33:13] to say here and if daddy says abraham
[1:33:15] and he means adam
[1:33:16] right now lord you're supposed to know
[1:33:20] the difference
[1:33:22] i honestly i try to correct him because
[1:33:23] the people on the tape
[1:33:25] yeah because they'll take what you say
[1:33:28] and they'll say just like brother brown
[1:33:30] 707 000 they wrote him about 10
[1:33:32] questions brother brown you mean 700
[1:33:34] what they were doing is they were saying
[1:33:36] did you change the bible
[1:33:39] it means 700. no i just said 700 meant 7
[1:33:43] you know just a human error human
[1:33:45] mistake but if rapture and faith doesn't
[1:33:48] last
[1:33:48] we can't put our sole dependency on what
[1:33:50] we read right
[1:33:52] we can't put our soul dependency on what
[1:33:53] we try to live i say try to live
[1:33:56] if we can't put our soul dependency that
[1:33:58] this message is infallible
[1:34:01] that's right then we can't take a body
[1:34:03] chain right right
[1:34:05] there is no way you're going to have to
[1:34:06] go to the grave and be purged
[1:34:08] that's right right you're going to have
[1:34:09] to be purged in the grave if you can't
[1:34:11] say that this message
[1:34:12] is rapturing faith doesn't lie on the
[1:34:15] tapes it lies in them
[1:34:16] so you gotta get in there and dig them
[1:34:18] out right all right
[1:34:20] amen
[1:34:26] look at number nine almost done
[1:34:30] seventh seal now we find out also this
[1:34:32] that the sixth seal now being open it
[1:34:34] was for a threefold purpose
[1:34:36] now here was the purposes the first
[1:34:38] thing was that the sleeping virgins had
[1:34:40] to go through the tribulation period for
[1:34:42] purification we just went through that
[1:34:43] remember
[1:34:44] they go through and they die all right
[1:34:48] she had to be purged of her sins there's
[1:34:50] that word purge
[1:34:51] of her sins of unbelief why she was that
[1:34:54] crawfish but she held a little bit of
[1:34:56] that mud in her
[1:34:58] she didn't get totally purged
[1:35:01] remember she's she's a virgin but she
[1:35:03] didn't get the holy ghost she didn't get
[1:35:04] god dwelling inside
[1:35:06] all right she had to be purged for her
[1:35:08] sin of unbelief and rejecting the
[1:35:10] message
[1:35:11] right this what she this she was done
[1:35:14] in the tribulation period we see that
[1:35:15] wind up over here in revelation 7
[1:35:17] between 6th and 7th chapter here that
[1:35:19] she had been pursed and she's been given
[1:35:22] her roles
[1:35:22] right all right now now she's not the
[1:35:26] bride but it's the church the pure
[1:35:28] people that that didn't have the
[1:35:29] opportunity maybe to receive a message
[1:35:31] or in some way that they were blinded by
[1:35:33] these false prophets right
[1:35:34] you notice that another purging time so
[1:35:37] the six sales all got to do with purging
[1:35:41] another purging time that's for israel
[1:35:43] when she gathers now he's talking about
[1:35:44] 144 000 right
[1:35:46] that's the second fold god purges israel
[1:35:48] in the tribulation period
[1:35:50] out of the millions that will gather
[1:35:51] there there'll be a selected
[1:35:53] 144 000 and they will be purged also
[1:35:58] god purging israel notice
[1:36:01] there is a whole earth to be purged
[1:36:03] that's number three
[1:36:04] all right there will be such a thing
[1:36:06] that the moon stars and all nature will
[1:36:08] be purged you see what it is the earth
[1:36:10] is renewing herself
[1:36:11] right being purged getting ready for the
[1:36:14] millennium
[1:36:14] the millennium's coming and see
[1:36:16] everything that's got any filth in it
[1:36:18] is to be purged during the sixth seal
[1:36:22] so god's shown all down through time
[1:36:24] that i am going to purge a group of
[1:36:26] people
[1:36:27] under this sixth seal now now do you
[1:36:29] notice in the opening of this seventh
[1:36:30] seal
[1:36:31] it's also in the threefold matter we'll
[1:36:33] get to that maybe later
[1:36:34] i know brother dale will so let's go to
[1:36:40] number 10.
[1:36:45] i i said a minute ago i that people
[1:36:48] must be alive to be purged because death
[1:36:52] purges the body for the ones that are
[1:36:54] going that went on by the grave but now
[1:36:57] how are they going to be brought up
[1:36:58] let's look at that just for a second
[1:36:59] don't look at the quote
[1:37:00] how's that going to happen yeah
[1:37:04] there's got to be a group of people
[1:37:06] that's purged more than the ones that
[1:37:07] died
[1:37:08] yeah that just makes sense
[1:37:12] it does that just makes sense it's got
[1:37:15] to be a group of people standing here
[1:37:17] that's so
[1:37:18] more purged than the ones that are in
[1:37:19] the grave that the ones are in the grave
[1:37:21] have to come and meet those that are
[1:37:23] purged right
[1:37:25] right so there's a soul purged group so
[1:37:29] you know what that you know what that
[1:37:30] shows me
[1:37:31] that it can happen right that's right
[1:37:33] and it will happen
[1:37:34] amen so there is a group of people
[1:37:37] that's going to be standing here
[1:37:38] that's going to be so purged that when
[1:37:40] death crawls up your sleeve
[1:37:41] right
[1:37:45] right right the mud goes out
[1:37:48] right the drops the junk right
[1:37:52] the flues get stopped up remember he
[1:37:54] talked about flush same thing with a
[1:37:56] with it with a crawfish but buddy once
[1:37:58] he's purged he's good to eat
[1:38:00] yeah but you've got to purge him first
[1:38:03] right before he's good and that's the
[1:38:05] same way what god's doing he's going to
[1:38:07] show purge a group
[1:38:08] said he would and under the seals he has
[1:38:10] to
[1:38:12] because it's the seals of redemption
[1:38:14] right
[1:38:15] so he has to do it because he promised
[1:38:17] he would so there's going to be a group
[1:38:19] so purged here
[1:38:20] that the group that's purged in the
[1:38:21] ground is going to have to meet that
[1:38:23] and they're going to have to come back
[1:38:24] to that that's why they're going to come
[1:38:26] back to us
[1:38:27] that's my brother ramsey you're going to
[1:38:28] look around you're gonna see what
[1:38:30] you're gonna see the people that come
[1:38:31] out of the grave you're gonna see them
[1:38:33] why
[1:38:33] because they're connected to you right
[1:38:35] you've been so purged by the word of god
[1:38:38] now look let's just get 10 11 12 and 13
[1:38:41] here real quick
[1:38:43] because we've got to get into the
[1:38:44] gentiles
[1:38:47] in the feast of pentecost and then we're
[1:38:48] going to look just for a second at the
[1:38:50] feast of trumpets
[1:38:51] and then we'll do the feast of the
[1:38:53] trumpets maybe sometime later
[1:38:55] what can bring these things but the word
[1:38:58] they can do nature any way they want to
[1:39:00] here it is they're the one who brings on
[1:39:03] this sick seal right
[1:39:04] they uncover and open it now listen
[1:39:07] what do they say
[1:39:11] what position are they in to be able to
[1:39:13] say that
[1:39:14] right because a group of gentiles
[1:39:19] has come to that position amen first
[1:39:23] that's right right because we're first
[1:39:24] partakers the feast of pentecost you got
[1:39:27] you took right right the feast of
[1:39:29] pentecost is when god comes to the
[1:39:31] people
[1:39:32] all right beats the pentecost the the
[1:39:34] whole time from pentecost to the gentile
[1:39:37] doors shut that's the feast of pentecost
[1:39:39] when god comes and gives us the baptism
[1:39:41] of the holy ghost
[1:39:42] right all right so watch they uncover
[1:39:44] and open it up it's the power of god to
[1:39:46] interrupt nature see the sixth seal is
[1:39:48] completely an interruption of nature
[1:39:50] right so it's got to be that they know
[1:39:54] something about that nature
[1:39:58] or nature i'm talking about the ground
[1:39:59] nature and all these things
[1:40:01] looking back and seeing that we took a
[1:40:04] rapture
[1:40:07] by the interruption of our nature
[1:40:11] that's the way i see it they're
[1:40:12] connected with us
[1:40:14] those two prophets brother brown said
[1:40:16] the spirit will come off the gentile
[1:40:18] church and do what
[1:40:19] go right over to the jews and start with
[1:40:21] them
[1:40:22] what the same message right the same
[1:40:25] message that look glory
[1:40:26] jesus christ purged your sin whether you
[1:40:29] said what you said or not
[1:40:31] let his blood be on us and our children
[1:40:32] he promised you you know what they're
[1:40:34] gonna do
[1:40:35] they don't even have to read them the
[1:40:37] new testament yeah
[1:40:40] because the old testament what's going
[1:40:42] to come alive right to those people over
[1:40:44] there
[1:40:45] because they know the word but when
[1:40:48] their eyes are open they're going to see
[1:40:50] isaiah 53 they're going to see a virgin
[1:40:52] shall conceive they're going to see
[1:40:53] and all that revelation i'd only believe
[1:40:55] they got to read the new testament
[1:40:58] why because that was to us
[1:41:03] corinthians and visions now that was to
[1:41:05] us right
[1:41:06] to take us up a statue of a perfect man
[1:41:08] or do those things but the old
[1:41:09] testament's gonna be made alive
[1:41:11] their their eyes have been covered from
[1:41:13] the old testament the revelation of the
[1:41:15] old testament
[1:41:16] do you know they have a lot of
[1:41:17] traditions over there right right
[1:41:19] tradition says
[1:41:20] tradition says what it's passed down one
[1:41:22] from the other tradition says this is
[1:41:24] what they've done
[1:41:25] tradition says this is what they saying
[1:41:27] psalms 19 or
[1:41:29] psalms 119 the tradition says they don't
[1:41:31] have a clue there's about 18 000
[1:41:33] different traditions
[1:41:35] but remember brother brown said that
[1:41:37] orthodox group that one that really
[1:41:39] knows the word
[1:41:40] god's going to come to him and say hey i
[1:41:44] came to you right here
[1:41:45] and you turn me down then they're gonna
[1:41:48] say
[1:41:49] oh god we're done
[1:41:53] because see they don't see redemption in
[1:41:54] there
[1:41:56] they don't see redemption and getting
[1:41:57] rejected right
[1:42:00] but god will say look i'm the one in
[1:42:03] isaiah 53.
[1:42:04] he said i'll take your transgression
[1:42:06] right i'll take your sin
[1:42:08] read daniel 9 24 he'll tell him he says
[1:42:10] look read daniel 9 24.
[1:42:11] look what happened i made an end to your
[1:42:14] sin i made an end to your transgression
[1:42:15] i made an end to your iniquity
[1:42:18] that's right you're free right you're
[1:42:21] purged
[1:42:23] and they say oh god we missed it but he
[1:42:25] said no don't worry these nail scars i
[1:42:28] got in the house are my friends
[1:42:30] do you get it now there's your seal who
[1:42:33] does it it's the prophets the other side
[1:42:34] of the rapture amen
[1:42:36] with the power of god the word of god
[1:42:38] they just condemn nature
[1:42:40] they can send earthquakes turn the moon
[1:42:42] into blood sun can go down or anything
[1:42:43] at their command amen
[1:42:45] there you are there you are see now how
[1:42:47] the seals open down there in the church
[1:42:49] ages
[1:42:49] look see how the seals open down there
[1:42:52] in the church age
[1:42:54] how it showed the martyrs and now here's
[1:42:57] these two prophets standing here with
[1:42:58] the word of god to do anything to nature
[1:43:00] they want to
[1:43:02] and they shake the earth see look the
[1:43:05] reason they're doing that
[1:43:08] all the gentiles are gone right that's
[1:43:10] right their body's not laying in the
[1:43:12] grave right
[1:43:13] he ain't got to be purged again right
[1:43:16] this earth has got to be purged
[1:43:18] all right remember they've had a
[1:43:20] resurrection their bodies have come up
[1:43:22] they've come out of the
[1:43:24] purging and they've taken their they've
[1:43:26] been taken up
[1:43:27] so these two prophets they said hey them
[1:43:30] guys over there can do it so can we
[1:43:33] all right because look
[1:43:36] and it shows exactly who does it it's
[1:43:38] moses and elijah because their ministry
[1:43:40] is re-impersonated again
[1:43:41] both men oh my do you see it now see
[1:43:43] what the sick seal is it's those
[1:43:45] prophets now notice
[1:43:46] don't let it choke you but watch what
[1:43:48] opened that seal
[1:43:50] prophets see amen there you are oh we're
[1:43:52] living in the eagle day brother
[1:43:54] head up among the clouds they open that
[1:43:56] sixth seal they have power to do it
[1:43:58] there's your sixth seal coming open
[1:44:01] all right let's go to the next one real
[1:44:02] quick number 11.
[1:44:04] now here is this is the feast of the
[1:44:06] trumpets now here's the calling out time
[1:44:10] now listen don't get involved in the all
[1:44:13] trumpet sound on the sixth seal and
[1:44:14] we'll break that down and brother dale's
[1:44:16] done it before and brother dean's
[1:44:18] preached on it before and
[1:44:19] several others just just be careful and
[1:44:22] let somebody explain it to you
[1:44:24] about all how the trumpets sound and how
[1:44:26] this happens and how that happens
[1:44:27] because
[1:44:28] it is a little confusing if you don't
[1:44:30] have it put together
[1:44:31] right all right same way we're down
[1:44:33] seven to eight same way with anything
[1:44:34] amen if you don't have it put together
[1:44:36] it's confusing and i don't like
[1:44:37] confusion
[1:44:39] now here's the calling out time at the
[1:44:41] sixth seal when it opened the
[1:44:42] persecution struck the jews
[1:44:44] in the literal standpoint listen now and
[1:44:47] here comes the persecution to the church
[1:44:49] and the ecclesiastical standpoint so the
[1:44:52] sixth seal is not just going to be to
[1:44:54] the 144 thousand
[1:44:55] it's a three-fold matter right it's
[1:44:57] where in the ecclesiastical standpoint
[1:44:59] who is that
[1:45:00] for the because the ecclesiastical
[1:45:03] people are going to kill the
[1:45:05] foolish virgin right right
[1:45:08] because the bride is already called so
[1:45:10] we're gone
[1:45:11] the sabbaths are over and ready for the
[1:45:13] jews to be called where to
[1:45:15] the feast of atonement oh church don't
[1:45:17] you see that call to the feast of the
[1:45:19] atonement
[1:45:20] to recognize the atonement not to kill
[1:45:23] something again you don't put christ
[1:45:24] back on the cross
[1:45:25] but you realize out of isaiah 53 that
[1:45:29] he's already been killed exactly
[1:45:31] he was bruised for your iniquity israel
[1:45:34] what re what to recognize the atonement
[1:45:36] not know more chickens and geese and
[1:45:38] what they've been doing
[1:45:39] the lamb of god slain from the
[1:45:41] foundation of the world israel
[1:45:43] is going to know that amen what it's
[1:45:46] going to be revealed all right let's try
[1:45:47] the next one
[1:45:48] six seal here it is in the tribulation
[1:45:51] period and here stands in prophets
[1:45:53] to who has the control of the word that
[1:45:55] god gives them they can only speak as
[1:45:57] god gives them the word
[1:45:58] see don't go down the bottom he's fixing
[1:46:00] to take the 144
[1:46:02] 000 out for redemption out of the book
[1:46:06] of redemption
[1:46:07] the sixth seal book of redemption all
[1:46:08] right and that's under the seal of
[1:46:11] redemption
[1:46:12] in the sixth seal because six seals
[1:46:14] finishes redemption
[1:46:16] sealed that redeem it brings crops back
[1:46:19] right
[1:46:20] that's why you can see now that it's the
[1:46:22] end of seven seals the end of all things
[1:46:24] right
[1:46:25] it brings him back to the earth with us
[1:46:27] in the millennium all right
[1:46:29] that's it my dear friends that's that
[1:46:30] sick seal being so mysterious
[1:46:33] the sixth cell is very important right
[1:46:35] very important
[1:46:36] you know the other all the other ones
[1:46:37] are but the sixth seal right now
[1:46:40] to a group of people the sixth seal is
[1:46:42] very important right because it's that
[1:46:44] last purging
[1:46:45] of the old nature getting ready
[1:46:48] for him to come back right right okay so
[1:46:51] we're right at the door of that i know
[1:46:53] that the first one is important if the
[1:46:55] first one didn't break you couldn't get
[1:46:56] the rest of them
[1:46:57] which is one god but i believe there's a
[1:46:59] group of people that's worked their way
[1:47:00] up to that
[1:47:01] amen sick seal up to that time to where
[1:47:04] we have to realize we have to be purged
[1:47:06] we have to realize that we have to walk
[1:47:08] the walk and talk the talk
[1:47:09] right all right let's go to number 13.
[1:47:11] lord i'm sorry it's 9 o'clock
[1:47:14] but let's get this right here because
[1:47:15] just kind of keep this in your mind
[1:47:17] because we're going to do the feast of
[1:47:18] the
[1:47:18] trumpets maybe later on after the first
[1:47:20] of the year and by the way i'm not going
[1:47:22] to
[1:47:23] uh i'm not going to the philippines i
[1:47:25] don't feel led to go now
[1:47:26] as much as i thought maybe i kind of
[1:47:28] have a zeal in my own self
[1:47:29] but i'm not going i'm going to kind of
[1:47:30] stay around the house stay around here
[1:47:34] the gathering of israel is the trumpets
[1:47:36] the trumpets is together in israel now
[1:47:38] what does the trumpet do blow of a
[1:47:40] trumpet it brings the group together
[1:47:41] right
[1:47:42] all right notice the very first trumpet
[1:47:44] sound blood fire
[1:47:45] hail and everything scattered the ground
[1:47:47] see what was he doing
[1:47:48] bringing israel out of spiritual egypt
[1:47:51] what way out all over the world
[1:47:53] bringing them back into their homeland
[1:47:55] now let me say this right here that
[1:47:57] every trumpet that blowed blown under
[1:47:59] the sixth seal
[1:48:01] so we'll get into that don't worry about
[1:48:02] that but all the trumpets
[1:48:04] because the trumpets are to israel sure
[1:48:05] we get the spiritual part we get the end
[1:48:07] gathering and the feasts of pentecost
[1:48:09] and we get to feast the trumpets right
[1:48:11] as far as the spiritual aspect bringing
[1:48:13] us together
[1:48:14] setting us right here today right what
[1:48:17] did the feast of trumpets do today it
[1:48:19] brought you here
[1:48:20] and then gathering all the trumpets
[1:48:23] sounded
[1:48:24] under the sixth seal because the seventh
[1:48:27] seal there was silence no one knew that
[1:48:29] was a minute or hour that christ would
[1:48:30] come as he revealed it to us
[1:48:31] notice now exactly the continuity of the
[1:48:34] scripture exactly the same
[1:48:36] under the seventh trumpet is to israel
[1:48:39] all right look israel gets the trumpets
[1:48:41] and they get the literal part of the
[1:48:43] seal but we get the spiritual part of
[1:48:45] all this right
[1:48:46] right right under the seventh trumpet is
[1:48:48] to israel
[1:48:51] is that is to israel the same as the
[1:48:53] seventh seal
[1:48:55] was so it had to already open was to the
[1:48:58] church we found under the seventh
[1:49:01] ceiling when those
[1:49:02] souls that were under the altar there
[1:49:03] received robes they were given robes not
[1:49:05] that they earned them because they were
[1:49:07] in the dispensation
[1:49:08] when god was still dealing with grace
[1:49:10] with the gentiles not the jews
[1:49:12] so that ought to be a key right there to
[1:49:14] show you the feast of trumpets
[1:49:15] that the uh fifth sealed jew receives
[1:49:18] robes right exactly under redemption
[1:49:22] dealing with grace with gentiles not the
[1:49:25] jews right
[1:49:25] because when the gentile door is closed
[1:49:27] he's going to go to the jews
[1:49:29] right amen israel is saved as a nation
[1:49:31] god deals with israel as a nation
[1:49:34] gentile is a people not a nation for his
[1:49:36] name
[1:49:37] so the seventh trumpet let's read before
[1:49:39] we close let's read
[1:49:40] revelation excuse me
[1:49:54] eleven
[1:49:56] 15 it's not on there but if you can find
[1:49:57] it real quick in your bible because this
[1:50:00] is the seventh trumpet
[1:50:02] to israel is the same as the seventh
[1:50:04] seal to you and i
[1:50:06] and the seventh angel sounded and there
[1:50:08] was great voices in heaven saying the
[1:50:10] kingdoms of this world
[1:50:15] for us are become the kingdom of our
[1:50:20] lord and of his christ and he shall
[1:50:22] reign
[1:50:23] forever and ever amen so that's gonna
[1:50:25] happen to us
[1:50:27] before it happens to israel right amen
[1:50:30] but it happens to israel bringing in the
[1:50:32] kingdom remember the ten toes
[1:50:34] the ten toes have to be destroyed ten
[1:50:36] kingdoms have to be destroyed
[1:50:38] by the battle of armageddon that's where
[1:50:40] all of everybody pulls together
[1:50:42] right there's no united states russia
[1:50:46] china
[1:50:46] in the millennium that's god's time
[1:50:49] that's the kingdom of god being set up
[1:50:52] not the kingdom of man there's nothing
[1:50:54] to do with man because what
[1:50:55] god has purged a bride
[1:50:58] purged 144 thousand
[1:51:03] and before that he really purged the
[1:51:05] fifth sealed jew 144 000
[1:51:08] and the earth and now god can ride right
[1:51:11] down right
[1:51:12] and the kingdoms of this world are
[1:51:15] become
[1:51:16] the kingdoms of our lord
[1:51:19] and of his christ and he shall reign
[1:51:22] forever
[1:51:23] you love the lord amen maybe that will
[1:51:25] help you a little bit when we get into
[1:51:27] read in the bible about purging
[1:51:30] psalms 51 says purge me with hyssop and
[1:51:33] i shall be clean
[1:51:34] wash me and i shall be harder than snow
[1:51:37] psalm 65 3 iniquities prevail against me
[1:51:41] as for our transgressions thou shalt
[1:51:43] purge them away
[1:51:44] amen my mercy and truth iniquity is
[1:51:47] purged and by the fear of the lord man
[1:51:48] departs from evil
[1:51:50] proverbs 16 51. just keep reading down
[1:51:52] through there
[1:51:53] even in malachi he's talking about
[1:51:55] purifying of silver
[1:51:56] and purifying of gold and you may offer
[1:51:59] that to the lord what a purging
[1:52:02] purge the old weapon that's what we were
[1:52:04] talking about right
[1:52:05] purge the old man let's sing a song
[1:52:09] 341 greatest he that is
[1:52:16] greater is he that is
[1:52:56] is
[1:52:59] he promises an overwhelming power
[1:53:12] is he that is
[1:53:38] greater
[1:53:53] all of you that are born again
[1:53:56] that have the power of god inside of you
[1:53:59] i want you to come up here and touch
[1:54:00] your prayer clothes before you walk out
[1:54:02] that head
[1:54:04] what's been said today
[1:54:16] and believe what mark 16 says
[1:54:36] take care of each other
[1:55:44] in world
[1:56:26] is
[1:56:54] is
[1:57:12] according to marxism
[1:57:36] is
[1:57:50] everybody
[1:58:04] is
[1:58:14] is
