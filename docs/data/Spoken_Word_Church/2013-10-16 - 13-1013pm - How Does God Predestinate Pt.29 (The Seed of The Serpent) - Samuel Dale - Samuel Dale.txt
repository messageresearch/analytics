a visitor and you get a welcome after then you don't get a welcome because there's nothing to join or nothing to do we're just part of the body of Christ and we we don't have anything here to join up with we're just striving for the glory of the Lord so we appreciate you coming and being with us just pray that the Lord would open our understanding and let us all walk in his love me remember now brother forny will be with us the Lord willing on the 30th of this month on Wednesday preaching for us and remember the others brother uh Bob will be preaching Sunday morning and Aaron you're going to be here Sunday afternoon okay we never know about him he's up and going around have to check with him so brother Aaron will be taken to Sunday afternoon service so we'll let these two get in on to the uh preaching end of it for a while amen if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Romans 8 and we will go to Genesis 3 Romans 8 in Genesis 3 any other announcements I generally forget something that to fail to announce but just remember these amen Heavenly Father we thank you for all things we thank you for this day in your love unto us thank you more than anything for saving our souls and filling us with your love and giving us your understanding we pray that you would just bless us now as we read your word and we try to speak about about you Lord and that you would come on the scene and speak to our hearts and our lives through the revealing of Thy word Lord you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe that it's all in your word so we just PR trying our best to Endeavor to speak about you and your loving grace we ask you to forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and let us be gathered together in you in your loving grace in Jesus name amen Romans 8 28-31 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called the he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things to all of these statements above what can we say if God be for us who can be against us right amen let's go over to Genesis now and we'll begin reading in Genesis 3 and try to pick up our thought from this morning and move right on in and the now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God ha said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die the serpent said unto the woman and you shall not surely die for God do know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as God's knowing good and evil let's just stop there because we may not get down to the rest of it uh the next two verses but you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word so we're trying and endeavoring to speak about to you and I to get us in a better understanding of how does God predestinate all right we've had all kind of church allies and manies and theologies about that down through the uh time and all but uh you know getting down to the end where the word is being revealed then we see that we get get to an understanding how does God predestinate by his full knowledge that's simple too simple for us to stop and anchor our whole life our whole being upon that thought you know it's too much because we want to figure out things that's the point we were getting at this morning and and I wonder why that you know that I speak the way I do and try to cover it uh and keep going over and over it because maybe it's needful but we need an understanding by Revelation instead of a head knowledge head knowledge is fine that's great but we need it revealed to us and it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal the word you know man cannot reveal the word to you and I even Jesus himself said my own life didn't show that unto thee speaking to Peter he said but the father he revealed it all right so then no man can reveal anything so we just do the best we can talking about the Lord and and and things that we see and we let him speak uh to our hearts and our lives and our doings but now as I said we we understand that God's forn knowledge is a wonderful thing and it looks down through and Before Time Ever began he could look down through and see the beginning the end all of the things if we don't believe that to be true then what kind of a god do we have you know what are we talking about but we believe that he's totally infinite which means he knows all things so then we don't have to worry about uh you know we we're not trying to pull anything over on him and and a thoughts like that in our mind because we believe he's God and he changes not all right then being that then he Reveals His word to you and I and that makes us his children his offspring and he before the world knew that we would desire to be saved so he would have it here for us all right that's simple terminology simple thoughts of doing it so then we could look at predestination without being mly confused you know well God predestinated this to be so there's no way I can't change it well you know if that's what you believe about it you might as well go ahead cuz you can't change it anyway cuz you're not going to change his mind no matter what we try to change it ain't going to change God's mind he saw it before the world he predestines not by even his own desires because he desired that everybody be saved according to the Bible all right but he predestines according to our to his for knowledge of what we will do all right then getting to that then we can see as we were trying to cover this morning that he knew that if he created Lucifer Satan uh the anointed jerb all of the titles you want to give him he knew if he gave him free moral agency which is the right to choose you know he knew Satan would fall so in that doing he allowed him to do that and Satan as we talked about the anointed cherub he pulled a third of the stars of Heaven together around his Doctrine his idea and and he had to be cast out of heaven according to Revelations 12 when he did he came to Earth and when he came to Earth don't worry about playing around with the devil either cuz he remember he started off the anointed cherub so even uh who was it um Gabriel Gabriel and trying to come to Daniel couldn't come why because Satan was there to hinder that's how powerful he is all so he had to send Michael to take care of Lucifer Satan where Gabriel could come on to Daniel all right so don't think you can pull anything over on the devil either that's right right about the time you think you got him figured out you just found out he you ain't figuring him too good he he's he's he's a smart fell but I believe the Holy Spirit I believe the Holy Spirit can tell us about the devil in his ways and that's what I'm trying to do to talk about the fall in the garden and what took place and seeing that Paul was concerned there in Corinthians that you know that Satan through his subtility 2 Corinthians 11:3 that he would deceive us like he did Eve all right don't ever think that you you yourself are a match for the devil and you're not to consider that thought it should never enter our minds cuz about the time you think that you're smarter than the devil remember he's got you because that's the wisdom so we trust the holy spirit amen the Holy Spirit the devil is no match for the holy spirit all right so we trust him to tell us but now remember the way that I always try to explain things a caral you know a carnal way but just remember if you think you're smarter than the devil you're already right in the middle of his trap he's already got you confused right all right so there's no need of ever trying to do that just just go on and accept it and let God uh speak to us and lead us in the correct way okay now trying to back up a little bit to to where we can can get a better understanding and watch God knew also that if he gave Adam and Eve a choice the greatest way he could create them was perfect and that's what they were all right but yet in all of that they did fall now you say but but Eve was the only one that failed well you better remember Adam's Once Sold a human race right the Bible says in Adam all die right it doesn't say in Eve Eve Eve was the one used to bring about the Fallen condition yes but Adam was not deceived the Bible said that's what made him in trouble Eve was deceived she thought she was right but Adam was not deceived he knew exactly what he was doing and he knew when he took Eve that he was selling the human race into Satan's hands right so then don't blame Eve for all of it just get down to the point that what I like to do is what I was trying to do this morning and what I've been trying to do two or three services and and I reckon it's meant for me to just stay on this a little is to get us to understand now I don't believe believe you can be a born again Christian and never be lost now truly born again Christian I believe you can repent of your sins you can do things and all but if you're ever truly born again you you won't be lost all right but don't ever get it in your mind that you can't do wrong when you do the devil's got you well I can't do wrong well then you go out and do wrong who you going to blame to doing wrong on you know well the devil made me do it well like the prophet of God said he said you went out to him he can't come in where you're at so just remember that in our thoughts because that's what I'm W us to see that what caused Satan to get kicked out of heaven was he begin to reason that's right he begin to build build himself up in his thinking he began to want to be the the to take over he wanted to do it he was over the worship service in heaven well that's why he loves good music and good singing I do too enjoy the sister singing I love good music I believe God does but the devil does he ain't out in The Honky tongs today no he's sitting up here the front row and this side's empty so he's got his own Pew right up here and uh you know he wants to be where the people of God is at because he enjoys that he he's not out in The Honky Tong he doesn't got that he wants to be here and like I was talking yesterday with somebody when the you watch the young men come along in this message especially and they they begin to move and they get great followings and things just leave them alone a little while let them go after a while they'll either settle down and get straightened out or they'll just run on off and take some of them with them you know because that's the way it does see everybody wants to flock after some new thing you know some new idea some new doctrine well that's what Satan's doing that's that's the point now the last two or three services that I'm trying to drive into me and you I don't say anything about you listening to these other brothers and things you know these other ministers but the only thing I tell you is what listen to what they're saying check it out with the message and see whether it's right or not it's a good thought that's wonderful but what good is it if it's a wrong thought but it's like I tell you then I I don't have any problem but now when you then bring that back here among the congregation and I see you outside sneaking off in little groups and yakking away and uh talking about what you've heard so and so say that's good if it's right but if it's wrong then I'll say something about it from here because that's my job right and you know the way I know that you know how that I can tell you I don't have discernment I got sense did that work out all I got to do is just there's brother dick and brother Mark and they're just yaking away and I walk up and they go what yall talking oh we wasn't talking about nothing we wouldn't talking about nothing I know I done run into one of them little doctrines that they're trying to spread you know right among the people you know so I'll say something about it when I get a chance but listen whatever you would think about the literal happening in the garden you know we know something did happen and we believe we know what did happen all right we don't believe ate Eve ate an apple because you pass out apples all day and it don't make nobody find out they're naked all right but you can look at that and say well that was the seed of the serpent brother uh Bob and Joe just put that on there this evening seed of the serpent is the title I give them titles as we go along and everything else there's something back there running okay what is the seed of the serpent well it was Eve and the Beast no no now that only produced The Seed of the Beast right and the Beast didn't have no soul he didn't have no ability he was just used of Satan but the main thing is the seed of The Serpent and that's what Paul was cautioning us about lest he through his subtility deceive us like he did Eve through the Simplicity that is in Christ the Simplicity of knowing the truth you know the Bible teachings of the truth and in that see Satan then comes in and he just little wordings he didn't jump on Eve all at once and just you know thing go wrong there's no telling how long that he spent talking to her he got her to reason as the prophet of God said all right he said well we shouldn't reason no we shouldn't reason about God's word he said well you quoted this morning come let us reason that's right come let us reason with God right not with one another all right so Eve as she begin to reason she accepted Satan's lie and how close was that lie we deal with that he only changed one word in the lital old scripture you know shall die he said shall not we talk about that's how simple it was but I'm talking about how close the truth is and what Satan's doing in the end time and how close the truth really is right if it was one word that caused all of this then how's it going to be with all of this in the end time this bombarding you and I in the things trying to give us new light you know this is not new light the message of the Prophet was not new light that's right you remember the other week we were talking about that and let him say it he said this is the oldest Doctrine that's ever been that's right this end time message was the oldest Doctrine that's ever been because it's the truth right so that's the oldest Doctrine see it started up in heaven we spent a long time back there before coming down to earth with our message all right so then the fall was not the physical act as much as it was the spiritual act in the mind of Eve right he knew how to get to her mind see we spend all of the time wanting to try to prove that well Eve was made different than Adam anybody knows that all you got to do is look at the door on the they still got it there look on the door to bathrooms you know and one of them got a dress on the other got on pants there any problem with being able to look and see that there's a difference between a man and a woman you know that's the only thing we dealing with we want to talk about the seed of the serpent well you know well it was just a sex act when even the beast but now my Point's always been one thing do you mean to tell me that Eve had a husband if she'd had any problems and we know that wasn't developing at that time trying not to talk too plain but why would she receive a beast yeah that's that ought to be enough to let you know a lot of things she was greatly fastly deceived before the literal act took place she had already accepted in her mind what the other things would be but she got that from Satan and his knowledge his wisdom his understanding you remember the prophet of God said that he had a knowledge of the principles of life yeah so he knew that the monkey and the man wouldn't mix see that couldn't work but there was a beast standing there because the Bible called The Serpent was most sub of all Beast he was made a snake when his arms and legs went off he went on his belly and was crawling and said dust shall be thy meat that'll you know he was an upright creature walking around he could talk he did talk with Eve yes all right day in and day out they talked about things and you know yourself that now I get in trouble okay everybody says I'm picking on my wife I pick on everybody here now she thinks I do I pick on every one of us I don't mind saying it you can say well you why don't she tell you why something at home I tell her at home what I want to tell her but when I'm talking with the pull pit about women I'm talking about women not one woman all right I didn't say it your Prophet said that a woman was a thousand times easier to be deceived than a man now I didn't say that evidently he must have know what the Bible said don't you think so yeah but I ain't been deceived well you're one of the women that ain't but you know the truth about it that's why I'm against women working in offices with men and things I know some of you may have to do it I'm not saying anything other than I'm against it cuz you never go to work sisters smelling like you do the evening before at home right you're all pred up every time he sees you you're all fixed up huh and then they start talking and she just pours out her heart and says my husband is not being good to me hey he just not being good to me well then he start well that's right and my wife's not being good to me too that's how easy Satan can get an inroad and after a while you see things start getting flirty dirty as we call it or whatever the word is you know they begin to get too close things start happening well can't you see that's what happened in the garden the devil all he had to do was tell Eve say well you know Adam and the Lord hadn't and told you the whole story there's more to the story yeah they just hadn't told you all of it yet can't you look around and see the animal race and how they're multiplying well yeah but yet they think you're a dummy you don't understand see he's just easily inroad and I said every day at work gradually just a few words just a look just just a thing right right come on and in doing it it finally winds up into trouble well what happened in the garden but I want you to see the spiritual part of it are the the part of the contact was not a physical contact between Eve and the Beast to start with it was over a period of time and he begin to say you know he was made for this purpose look at the animals they're reproducing but you and Adam don't have any children they're keeping that from you well that's all it took right all you got to do is is to tell men or women either one you know you know I can say uh brother dick what does Brother Ray have a a forget it forget it oh not even never said anything forget it well brother Dick's going to wonder the rest of the day what's matter with Ray cuz I just planted a seed that's right I use them to cuz they own the they on the internet together all the time so they can yak with each other see what I want you to see is the Simplicity it wasn't just a ravishing act it took a long time to be able to break down the barrier that Eve was behind because remember she told Satan we can eat of every tree but this one tree we can't eat of well how come you can't eat of that tree and like I said Wednesday you just tell one of them little kids you tell them one of them little kids you say now every thing in this Garden out here you can do what you want do with it but leave that bush Alone Now where's the kid going going to the bush cuz it's something different tantalizing right boys oh no oh see we're just older kids it just takes a little bit more you know right for us older kids you know 70 80 years old but we still the human being it took Satan quite a while to be able to talk to Eve and be able to deceive her he got her to reason about what was you know what was going on and then she began to reason on that point see the next was a physical part all right but see it's not that we are physically in adultery today that wasn't what Paul was talking about Paul was talking to Christians right they should not have any thought about an adulterous act right he was talking to Christians when he said lest he deceive you through his subtility amen getting into inroad of owners and like I said a while ago don't you ever think that you can't be deceived well now the bride Brother D can't be deceived can't be deceived enough be lost I agree with you but I got a quote laying on the desk at home my wife keeps telling me what's all this I said quotes they just ly across there where brother Ram said it like this he said frankly if he didn't cut to work short for the elect's sake he said there'd be no flesh saved he said they'll have one quote says they'll have to come a Rapture well thank God because God keeping his word that he won't let us be deceived right but just remember when you didn't believe in one God but yet you believed in a trinity you was deceived true when you didn't believe that God sent a prophet for the last days he was deceived so don't worry about getting deceived that's what I've always tried to tell you I I don't try to preach to people to get them to deceived I try to preach to you to get you to an understanding you're already deceived all right see then that way I'm trying to touch the same thing or use the same positions to preach the gospel to you I'm using my reasoning my memory my conscience right to touch your memory your reason and your conscience because I know that's got where it's got to go through that's right all you're doing in the caste field smelling here is the vibrator in your ear is part of your body and it's vibrating but it turns that into words that makes you an ability to hear or a vocal cord is an ability to speak see the biggest sin of all is what what is sin it's not drinking gambling smoking right what is sin unbelief you do those things because you don't believe all right see unbelief unbelief in what in God's word Now Eve had a pretty good understanding of God's word she told the devil but he was trying to break down that uh barrier whatever that you would call it cuz she was a beautiful you she was in a perfect place coming from Adam no problems and your prophets wanted said it I didn't he said Eve was in Adam spiritually speaking and he said the reason Adam was lonely is because Eve was still in theophany right but how many preachers in this message is going to preach on that now I got a theophan up in heaven it's up under Eternal somewhere well why would you want eternal life here then just way you get up there right right you see what you don't realize is one thing I use that a lot you realize is is see Satan is still trying today to get you an eye off the word and he's doing a good job we've got one Bible like I said and got 969 different denominations off that one Bible we got one message and we got 10,000 doctrines following the message all saying the prophet said that that's Mass confusion right well do you think you got all the truth no but what I got I thank God for and I'm sure glad to talk to you about it but you see the reason I'm I'm trying to get I know what he's been doing with this mind so I Don't Preach what's going on in your life that's where people think that I preach the things that I experience amen all right Satan comes and talks to this old boy all the time I don't mind admitting it but yet I want to hear how many of you will admit it I spend more time talking to the devil than I do God now you come on up here and let's see you toine that we pray 5 minutes a day where's the other 23 hours and 55 minutes right the best we can do we spend more time communicating with the devil in the flesh than we do with God all right but Satan see he knows how to contact you and I he knew how to contact Eve he didn't start talking about how great he was now listen the devil never started talking about how great he was was he done seen that got him kicked out of heaven right you agree what got Satan kicked out of heaven him thinking how good he was and telling them other third of the Angels how good he was and how nice he was and everything and he ought to be in command and like I've always told you he never could understand because he was the anointed sherff standing beside the Lord probably the first Angel cre was Lucifer son of the morning God's right-and man and he's standing there and God says you know Lucifer I'm going to create a world I'll do it for you I'm the one that's going to do it and he said and Lucifer said I'm going help people there will be my way of doing things if I if he's got people and he's he says well okay now God let's get on with it well God don't turn around and say Lucifer you speak it about that time outstep somebody that's right right God in another form call the word L God speech etc etc and as he did he began to say Let There Be and Lucifer's watching he knows right then he' done lost his position that he thought he had he thought if there's anything to be done he's going to do it well you know what a lot of times we get that idea you I've heard preacher say if he anybody's going to preach it I'll be the one that'll preach it or brother so and so will you know well you know God uses who he wants to that's why I listen to your sisters cuz he can use you to talk to me any problem with that but you understand what I'm getting at yes Satan didn't come to Eve and say look at what I am he come to Eve and said look at what you are he knew better than to tell her what his real plan was now come on we get in a church age book a later where the prophet of God said that that tree of knowledge was there and said it had to do with Mankind and said would be the inroad of Satan in his ways of entering into the human race that he could not create as God could so he had to get Eve to go along with a plan what plan do you think Eve was just that bad of a person no why would your Prophet say Eve thought she was right and he says she still thinks she's right now you to answer that one you sisters come on now that's what he said he said she thinks she's right and he said she still thinks she's right he said look at the churches they're all women right no mother of Revelation 17 Harlot daughters and don't they still think they're right right I haven't seen any news commentator yet saying that the Baptist admitted that's wrong have you and I'm not throwing off on Baptist I'm just using that as a word but think he did not approach her as to try to show her who he was he knew that would come to pass as time went on right but he tried to get her to see who she was she was to bring in the human race right whether it would be physical or whatever you want to call it foken word I still believe Eve would have been used to bring the human race into being if she hadn't Fallen don't you okay you know why I believe that because she was the one that was used to bring it out to the fall right and she still think she's right you think a woman is going to tell you she's deceived not a man ain't either right well that wasn't really like it was they didn't tell it like it's supposed to be ain't that our ways of doing you know like I heard of a man saying one time and this man was telling the truth now according to him because he saw it he was riding in home to the taking a man home one day and there stood the the man that he was taking home you know there stood his wife on the porch kissing the man you know and he pulled up and boy he jumped on to her a you're kissing that man she said I wasn't kissing that man he said I saw you kissing him he said she said to him are you going to believe what your eyes saw or you going to believe what I tell you right now that's pretty deceiving right when the man said well I guess I didn't see what I thought I saw now that was not told it was a joke that was supposed to been told it was a story that was true because really what was she saying she was saying if you think I was kissing that man you get out the door but if you'll accept I wouldn't kissing that man you can stay here come on women you know what you got and what to do with it right is that vulgar no truth and it took a while for Satan to be able to get Eve to the point to believe that she was going to have a part to do in bringing forth the promise of God come on we can spend all day talking about it right Satan could tell her say well look look at the animals they're reproducing but you and Adam's not reproducing said whatever it's going to be get on with it now if you think I ain't right we're going to get into the scriptures a little later but what did Eve say about Cain is in the scripture she said I got a man from the Lord that's what he said that's right now remember her name wasn't Eve to start with her name was Adam Eve is over where the fall came right she was not called Eve in Chapter 2 three or what it is there it was when that come forth and said Eve because she's the mother of all living that's where she developed the name Eve before the in her name was Adam just like Christ and a bride but when we let Satan try to inroad into our minds and deceive us right but you see sometimes it's hard to comprehend truth easy to preach a lie that's right you know Paul said for us to get away from endless genealogies you remember that in Scripture and yet God was the one that said make all the records of the people God is the one that made all of the Endless genealogies what's Paul talking about when he says get away from endless genealogy he's telling you to get away from from trying to run some form of a lineage that you could find yourself somewhere CU that's endless genealogy but for it to say so and so we got so and so and so and so we got so and so and so I remember in the Baptist say we were requested that we read the Bible well the first time I began to read it I really enjoyed a whole lot of it but when I got over into part of it I began to read so and so but got so and so and so and so but got so and so and so and so and but got so and so and so and so and I hour later I was still so and so gotten so and so right that sounds like endless genealogy but it's not that is not endless genealogy that is not what Paul was talking about of keeping records that's right because that is a record of the children of Israel right cuz it comes right on down and it says and so and so and so and so we got and Adam I mean David and David So a genealogy what am I doing illustrating how easy it is to be deceived to quote the scripture we don't believe in Endless genealogies okay let's take and just rip out them Pages out of the Bible that gives all the records you see Satan's wisdom is still deceiving you and I tonight I mean this afternoon you said but Brother D I've been in the message 40 years amen how long's the message been in you right I left the Baptist Church and walked out I said Lord first church I was in it gainful I said Lord I'm glad you got me out of the bap but now would you get the Baptist out of me I don't believe none of that oh why we still tied up with it thinking about what took Eve down was the simple things that's taking you and I down right some of you are sitting here without mates you know no husband no wife I shouldn't have to explain a lot of things especially to you because you know what the devil does to you that's right and talks to you that's right you see I'm not picking on anybody I'm picking on everybody we let Satan interpret to you and I amen right and he tells us what the prophet is saying what the Bible is saying that's okay if it's true but like I said this morning uh showing the simplicity I'm just talking I'm just trying to talk to us about what happened in that fall everybody wants to run over to the literal act like I said Paul wasn't writing to people about a literal act in 2 Corinthians but he was warning us that Satan through his subtility would try his best to deceive us right right right what are they doing now in the message attacking the message attacked in the prophet attacked in the statements he made what are they trying to do to get you and I where we won't believe it cuz if you entertain those thoughts you know you entertain it now come on don't play games with me I don't play games with you okay that's what gets me into trouble I'm too plain but I don't want people playing games with me I don't want to play nothing with you I don't I mean what I say and say what I mean I don't see then Satan will attack our minds and try to interpret the message to us or he'll say look at there he said this and he said said this we can't believe it I mean he done that when we was in the Baptist Methodist didn't he Pentecostals didn't the devil tell you that you can't trust the Bible right didn't he tell you where the fallacies was in it the contradictions that was in it no probably a lot of lot of people like biggest portion of people they were sitting there just like they're sitting now what do you mean message I believe everything Prophet says well it says forsake not to assem any of yourselves together as the manner of unbelievers are let me turn over that page right see you don't want to be exposed nobody does but is it true see Satan has got his inroad through our reasoning and if he can tear down our thoughts about the message to think that the prophet was not right because of a wrong date that was given or a incident that happened here when it should have happened over there Satan is planting those things in the mind of the people right right right and there turning down the truth cuz they will not listen to Somebody amen like waitting I in a Services just recently in the ministri meeting went through at length on Daniel 70 weeks to show that brother randam was right and it never changed one of those ministers but yet they got up later and said brother Randon was right over here and wrong over here or you can't believe this you can't believe that all I ask him at the end of it I said come show me where I'm wrong well you know what they're saying I don't believe it I don't believe it the way you believe it okay but is it what God said if the Bible says there's one true and living God then where do we have any right to do discuss or think about how it could have been that it could be some way of a Trinity right right right there's no discussion that's right and when a prophet would say Eve was deceived how many of you sisters have had it in your mind since I've been talking Adam was too I guess now who told you that you said well you did well to go because you was talking but you understand what I'm getting at yes and the Bible says something and we don't believe it as to what it says understand it we're deceived and see that's what I watch and I keep saying to you and I over and over let's believe this message and no matter what anybody says that's right we stay with the message right amen yeah but look at what's Happening Here look what's happening there look out here where they're having these great meetings and things well wonderful well we just sit around here dry well the reason you're dry is because you to hide it sure a never been my fault if you dry right you said well you just yeah I know it I just try to preach the word that's one if I'm dry that then I'll just stay with it I won't argue about KN the rest of it that's right I've been at it 40 something years I might as well keep on but in 40 something years I've asked you to show me the truth that's right if I'm not telling you the truth that's right like I said this morning then the people of the message will quote you something from brother brandham and they don't even look to see whether it's tying together correctly or not see not even looking to see whether that what he's saying is Right compared to what he says 40 years later I believe in in Progressive I know they say that's not a good word that's all right that's all I got progressive revelation I believe in that and what I mean by it is maybe not your interpretation of the word Progressive but what I mean is that God revealed something to you and while he'll reveal more and more and more and more and more and more of the same thing that's but if he revealed something to you and then a year later he revealed something that's contrary to that now one of them is the devil that's talking to you that's right might be both of them being the devil right I've got that much sense that's why I call that phrase see if you start off with a white dog in Genesis you better wind up with a white dog in the Book of Revelations it don't matter if you get there with a black and white dog that ain't what God Said to begin with that's right God can't he doesn't give something and then correct it right mankind gets something and God corrects it but God don't give something and correct it later that's right right no he was right to start with or he's not God all right but you see we want to talk about how bad you know how wrong this was or how wrong that is that ain't nothing but the devil as an inroad into your mind as I saying this morning then we look at Matthew 28:19 Jesus told the disciples after his resurrection to go preach the gospel baptizing the people in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell they came outside and they said men and Brethren what must we do to be saved they said repent every one of them be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you mean they couldn't remember Father Son and Holy Ghost come I a direct contradiction but it ain't a contradiction why because Father Son and Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ Peter done exactly what Jesus told him to do amen remember he was the spokesman the one Chosen and given the keys right but you see we put all of our Lives spend in in there Worlds the world is split over father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ whatever and because you don't believe their way you're going to go to hell well see the truth is the truth but Satan will still try to interpret that that's right as I ended up this morning showing you that the prophet of God up until 196 really up to 65 he was describing the the you the three Realms of men and he would say body five senses C tast feels smelling here he'd say second real Soul memory reason conscious affections Etc and he'd say Spirit only one sense Faith or doubt then when he come up to the end of 65 he picks up and he says Body Spirit and soul you say well is that important for us to understand that very very vital very very vital one of the most vital things I could think of right now because if not you got him in a direct contradiction well show me where he straightened it out he didn't have to cuz he was right Soul and Spirit is an interchangeable word yes it's used in the Bible interchangeably you got to know who it's talking about or what it's talking about Amen to Define which one it's speaking of see the prophet didn't have to correct it cuz he always gave five senses to the body he always gave five senses memory reason conscious affections right to the second real he always gave the center realm Faith or doubt amen well he didn't have to correct it because he was moving this wording maybe that was the way God done it because Hebrews 4:12 says that the word of God is powerful dividing between Soul and Spirit joint miror that's right now men have attempted to explain what a soul is what a spirit part is but where did you ever hear anybody could explain it like a seventh grade educated little old Prophet that's right can't you just see them Scholars sitting there the day he draws it out and they're just ding laughing and after a while he says well here's the Bible they can't argue Paul said that your body spirit and soul beer blameless right but you see he said why is it important for us to understand what he's talking because in his early Ministry he would inter the word Soul and Spirit and you see all kind of doctrines proved by the people of the message they say see th Eve Sinn in her soul that's a direct quote out spoken out of uh greatest battle ever fought now e sined in her soul she was lost and he's already already in that message covered or the Blasphemous names that that they had eternal life but you see people don't read and study it they just get an idea see there he sending her soul he's two Souls that was the doctrine years ago go back and see what he's talking about see whether he's talking about the outer real the rim or the middle Rim see which one he's talking about and then you'll have the right answer no matter what you use Soul and Spirit cuz it's totally interchangeable words where it says into thy hands I commend my spirit Jesus would say hanging on the cross or there in the garden my soul is troubled you see we are a trone being in basis of Father Son and Holy Ghost as an example but we're Body Spirit and soul all right go back in the early Ministry and listen to where he interchangeable and he'll never say he'll always say the second realm of man as memory reason conscious and affection doesn't matter if he calls it Soul all right but you see I thought maybe somebody today might be thinking cuz I was going to read these this morning and uh you know so we didn't get into it well I just happened to run them off now I only have about 40 copies so just take one copy per family where it brother around them on one side of the page is saying Body Soul Spirit the other side of the page in the 65 he's saying Body Spirit and soul so pass him out if you will while I'm talking cuz I want you to see that that's what he's saying but he's not contradictory it's just what I said Hebrews says 4:12 that the word that he came into in total Perfection will separate Soul and Spirit joint Myra all right as it does then we can see what took place in the garden brother Rand will say Eve sinned in her soul but then later he'll say it was the spirit of man and that you can even be Anointed with the Holy Spirit every day of your life on your spirit and die and go to hell bringing those two together see it didn't have to be corrected because he was right he just placed his senses in the correct order he always gave that first one C taste feel smell and here second Rim memory reason conscious affection no matter what he called it and the third was always Faith or doubt he didn't have to correct nothing but yet man are so smart do we get into the do and say well I got this quote here that says he send in or soul he may even say you sin in your soul but if you're a born again Christian you can't sin in your soul right but you can do wrong in your body and your spirit don't ever think you can't do wrong cuz you're right in Satan's trap thank you brother I just wanted you to read that of how many times that he started there in ' 65 and he was using Body Spirit and soul then you can understand the message you understand Jesus and the way he would speak see Satan is using every little thing that he can to try to take us down well you can't trust the message until 63 why not he was a prophet wasn't he did he become a prophet in ' 63 or was he born a prophet I've asked for contradictions in the message I didn't ask for stupidity I want something founded thank you brother I want something you know where you can look at it to where the Prophet was wrong now humanly speaking yes he was wrong at times right but I want somebody to show me where the message is wrong cuz he said said so much of this message is human beings cuz he was he said one day he said the black and white will fight again and die like flies that's right but I got that quote but go to the next tape right after then when he said that and listen to him say that was my idea that was not the Lord telling me you see we can put it in all kind of forms right twist anything to make it say what we want it to say and isn't that the same inroad that Satan has always used what are you trying to do brother Dale we'll end it by saying this much trying to get you and I to look at something straight up and down right now it's not what happened in the garden right what happened in the garden only brought about the the the thing that would cause the fall but you and I are sitting here in the day in a time that Satan's going to put us in the grave I told you that 40 years ago and I still don't back up I said over 40 years ago that the biggest portion of the Believers of this message would die and go by the grave ain't nobody can argue the point cuz You' heard it enough you'd have been here 20 years it heard it 20 years you know what I meant just what I said it's going to take something to make a change right and until we get it right and we're going to get into Blas get into the greatest battle ever fought I've asked you to read that message brother randam said right under where he's explaining that Eve began to reason and messed up the flues and and caused the problem you know what he said he said if we can get this certain thing fixed he said there won't be a sick person Among Us in five minutes said they won't be a sinner Among Us in five minutes he wasn't just preaching the Realms of Eve and the Realms of mankind he was preaching to what we're doing you don't reason with your soul is either Faith or doubt you reason with your spirit realm and remember the Bible talks about the sins you know the prophet of God said only Christians sin he said because everybody else is already condemned already you said what I don't sin brother Dale Prophet said you did so argue with him the Bible says you do says for the sins yeah but I don't disbelieve God's word back to this morning how come it is when somebody presents something to you whether you be in the Bible talking about baptist Methodist whatever or where you be talking about the people of this message what's the first reaction I don't believe it that way right or I don't know what I believe but I don't believe you that's right right that's the biggest one I don't know what I believe and I can't explain what I believe but I don't believe you well that's a good one a it right now I call that being deceived right because you asked me to tell you where I don't agree with you at and I'll try my best to explain it you won't get I don't know but I'm just don't believe you that's degrading that Al anything else but listen the seed of the serpent is the LIE that Eve Satan told Eve that's right CU it never been but one lie you remember it's the LIE there in the scripture the same lie he told Eve and how close it is to the truth because what was the lie that he told Eve he didn't talk to her about himself he talked to her about her got her to believe in it well how close is it when a preacher gets up and stands up and says the Bride of Jesus Christ is the liest form of God on the earth that's getting pretty close is it you think Satan ain't going to get in there and do that he ain't going to attack nothing else that's where he's running for but you see Church the truth shall set you free come on Brothers you shall know the truth it didn't say know about it hear it talk about it I said You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free amen what happened to Eve in the garden is the same thing that's happening to you and I right now Satan trying to get us off the word that's right right right but brother Dale brother so and so preaching and I just feel so good amen I said you preach and I I just don't know what amen just hang on a while right sister Gil just hang on a while it may take 20 years but some of you have told me lately that the messages lately have been better understanding to you than it's ever been well we'll keep that on going until

waiting them on the way home today coming back from Brother Dutch is preaching for him and just remember one another and pray the Lord would bless we pray that we've said something that would help cuz all we're trying to do is just talk about us it doesn't do any good to talk about what happened in the garden I mean that's head knowledge right you can read it out of the book I said knowledge that's right we just get more knowledge somebody comes along and explains it a little different way we just get more knowledge I want to know what's fooling with me I want to know whether that guy still right here today trying his best to pervert me because remember to Eve he was telling her what she was but there would come a time I didn't get to finish the message part but I sry it would come a time that it'll change from that but here in the end time he's still trying to get the bride to talk about who she is and whatever and everybody's bride and everybody's ready but it won't be long until the real one will be exposed and you'll find out he'll be starting to talk about himself because all these years he's been talking about her trying to get her deceived when he gets her deceived enough he'll step out the Bible calls him the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God you say oh it's this one it's that one you can put names on it that's what everybody's tried to do they tried to say well this this next Pope coming up well we had Pope after Pope well it'll be this one it'll be that one is that all you can see amen you better start looking at the mirror that's right if you hav never thought about it at all think about it what I'm saying you go home today tonight you're brushing your teeth or something getting ready to go to bed look in the mirror amen right and say that's the person brother Dale was talking about of course now you won't believe that cuz you'll believe I was talking about everybody else I wasn't talking about everybody else no Richard no Pitchfork you don't see me in your mirror I'm sorry you see yourself cuz that's the one that I'm trying to get get converted is this one to make it in the right way Lord Jesus we ask you to just open our understanding father we can look at Natural Things and talk about them all day but to see what you want Lord in our hearts and our lives there's the seed of the serpent trying to deceive Us in the end time just as well as it did in the beginning we ask you now to just help us give us understanding as we go on our way home take care of everybody give a safe journey we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you dism remember the service is 7:00 Wednesday h
