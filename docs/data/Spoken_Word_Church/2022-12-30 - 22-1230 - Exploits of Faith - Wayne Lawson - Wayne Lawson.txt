and amen um I trust you come tonight amen to receive something from the word of life and amen so if we could tonight maybe we'd just bow our hearts in a word of Prayer and his first night of the meeting is a Friday night and I wonder if you're standing there close to someone maybe you might just put your hand upon them and and you pray with them and ask God to do something special for their life tonight I believe this could be a special event in the presence of God almighty God we're here tonight because we're your children and Lord it is written that we're ever two or three are gathered in your name that you would come among them Lord and you would be in our presence now Lord we're certain you're here tonight by Your Word of Promise and by our faith to receive it Lord and wherever you are good things happen now we're expecting the supernatural among us tonight we're expecting God that you would move in a supernatural way speaking to the heart of your children father I pray your spirit would charge every believer here tonight to rise in another level of Faith Lord and father is these Believers one to another have their hands even laid upon each other praying one for the other I pray the Holy Ghost would just move in such a way Lord may you may you anoint your people tonight may you break every spirit that would be unlike you I pray you would bind them Father and Lord as we would speak to your children we ask the great witness that you would just come in the room and Lord you'd walk the aisles of this building tonight father if there be any sick among us I pray that you would heal them for it is written in your word that you've sent your word and you healed the people now we're asking you tonight to bring that Among Us Lord as we invite you into this room to be more than just our savior but Lord be our Lord tonight be the ruler of our souls and lives and speak to us from your word that we may know you father now we're asking these things in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles with us uh yeah I would if you just turn in the scripture with me tonight to the Book of Daniel the 11th chapter amen whoever is on the sound give me more in my in my Monitor let me control the volume that way um it's about three quarters before I get the sound in my ear just turn that side up probably on the board of the auxiliary just turn that part up we want to look in Daniel 11 and verse 32 Daniel 11 and 32. now this to me is a very powerful scripture but the Branham uses it a lot and he was he was very much placed this as an end time scripture so I want to just speak from it just for a moment tonight Daniel 11 and 32. and such do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people and can you say that with me the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits so we're going to be looking at a couple things the people no God and do great exploits amen so we want to tonight to speak to you a little bit upon the exploits of Faith you could be seated if you'd like and we just want to take a few minutes in the scripture here and I I um I'm I'm I'm that guy when I read scripture I think who's that talking about I want to know what the scripture is talking about and who who is it and is it uh is it a certain group of people is it a you know who who would that be and when you read this scripture of the people of God you are you all know everyone's trying to get that position uh that we're the people you know everyone wants to be the people of God uh but you know when God wrote his word I don't believe God was just throwing that out there uh that whoever wanted to be that but I believe God had something in mind I I think that God has he's an all-knowing God so God has something in mind when he writes something and when he says the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits I believe that it's I believe that it's speaking of a prophecy concerning a people uh the same book you read the book of Daniel and you read the 12th chapter of the Book of Daniel and it's it's a tremendous reading but it's also in the second and third chapters of Daniel that you'll find the the entire world events are prophesied through Daniel when he comes to Nebuchadnezzar's dream and then in Daniel 7 he has his own visions and he he tells you in the Book of Daniel who will be in controlling the world throughout the entire Gentile kingdoms so the Book of Daniel is a prophetic book of course it's an Old Testament book of Revelations right and so it's a it's a powerful book and uh and what's beautiful is to see that our name is actually in the book now the prophet tells us that when the seals are opened that what it will do is it will call our names by the revealing of that mystery and that's what I think is powerful is that you when you're able to hear it that it that it speaks to you now the people of course uh this would be another prophecy of this same of this same type comes in the book of Hosea when Hosea is spoke to by God uh here it says yet the number of the children of Israel shall be is the sand of the sea which cannot be measured or no burden she'll come to pass that in the place where it is said unto them ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of the Living God now you know that prophecy concerning of course when it says you are not my people but there so shall be said unto them you are the sons of the Living God now if that's just speaking to the Jews it would say you are the Servants of the Living God but being that it says that you are the sons of the Living God now we know it's dealing with the Gentile because Israel is servants and Gentiles or Sons so when he starts dealing with the sons then there's a hosea's prophecy speaking of this when they wasn't a people of course this is Abraham's seed right there there was no seed at all but he said thy seed shall be as the stars and the sand so it's a prophecy of a people coming when there was nothing there will be this great people coming in First Peter chapter 2 and 9 Peter describes the same people from The Book of Daniel 11 also in the book of Hosea and he's speaking talking of the Hosea prophecy when he says but you are a chosen generation you are a royal priesthood of course that's a king priesthood right royal priesthood Kings and Priests and a holy nation It's A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light now which in times past you were not a people but now are the people of God and have that which had not obtained Mercy but now you have obtained Mercy amen isn't it powerful that Apostle Peter is now taking that from the book of Hosea and he's identifying it into the Gentile church so what I'll say it was talking about is you Gentiles in Romans chapter 9 Paul will speak of the same prophecy Romans 9 23. he said he might mating on the riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath called not of the Jew only but also of the Gentiles as he saith in Hosea of course that's the book of Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass in that place where it is said unto them you're not my people they shall be called the children of the Living God so it's speaking of the Gentiles So when you say the people shall know their God now we realize that it's including the Gentile church but the Gentile church is a big church and there's a lot of people that's called into that but it starts narrowing down when you go into the scripture Into the Book of Revelations the 18th chapter and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins that you receive not her plagues now we're seeing that that people in Daniel 11 is now in the Book of Revelations the 18th chapter and the fourth verse and I I wonder who them people are amen that heard that voice to come out of Babylon amen that is the people the Gentile bride that is called out by the message of the hour remember brother random went beyond the curtain of time that that was one of the great Revelations he's seen those Millions coming to him and he said are these all branhams he said oh no these are your converts amen these are the people that scripture talked about that would come at the end time and they actually said to brother Branham had you not come we would not be here amen because he had to make that great decision in love divine remember he he had to make that great decision to stay with the word to open the word and because he did that there's a people amen that made the other side that had their robes washed and the pardoning grace of the word so I believe that that we would be those people can you see your name there in Daniel 11. Amen the people that know their God that's speaking of you you somebody said are we actually in the Bible of course you're in the Bible in Daniel 11 he's not just talking about any people he's talking about gentile people he's talking about the people called out under this message amen now Ephesians chapter 1 Paul would actually say in the 17th verse he says that this this should increase us this should give us something in Ephesians 1 he said the Lord a God uh the the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may he give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of it calling and what is the riches of the glory of the inheritance and Saints I tell you it's a powerful thing what Paul is saying here you hear Brother random say he pray for Revelation more than you pray for anything else now brother man was script scriptural because here Paul is saying to the church pray for understanding you see that's this is what job was talking about in job the 42nd chapter when he was asking God you remember God asked him where were you that he turns around and then he begins to ask God Amen in other words if this knowledge is accessible if this knowledge exists then I'm Desiring I'm thirsting to understand because God has said I can't understand that I'm not I'm not no longer satisfied but just a good sermon that or a good little Baptist Bible story that someone has to tell but the Bible said there would be a people that would know their God then this this knowledge is available then then God has intended for somebody to know him listen friends this is not just you wanting to know God he intends for you to know him and he desires to be known of you you know you know that great mystery Christ of history of God revealed beautiful book brother man brings open the purpose of God he said one of the great purposes of God the Great the great sole purpose the number one purpose was that God wanted to be made known Adam knew him Adam heard him say Adam talked with him Adam had the Angels but Adam did not know him in a way that satisfied God to be known but God let Adam fall from the Garden of Eden in Perfection he let him fall out of that Perfection to come into this time space that the revelation of who and what God is would be given back to man and then God picks man back up and brings him back into an eating condition but you have bypassed where Adam was standing in the beginning you don't know God like Adam you know God beyond what Adam knew amen it's not just that God says that you'll he loves you you understand the love of God you're understanding the grace of God you're understanding the power of redemption if anybody knows what it means to be saved I know what it means to be saved if anybody knows what it means to be the lost and undone I know what it means to be lost and undone and if God had not intended me to have that knowledge I would never have that knowledge amen but it wasn't that God wanted us to fall he wanted us to know he's a savior it wasn't that God wants someone to be sick he wants you to know that he's a Healer do you know the Bible said in John 14 that in that day they shall know that I am of the Father the father me and I in you there is a direct prophecy of Jesus his own words that you would know in this name some people said well you can't know you're born again but Jesus said you could and Jesus said there would come a day that you would know and you said how would I know brother random says it like this John 14 and 20. he said I'll tell you what will happen right there he says God Elohim will become material in the Church of the Living God Amen just as God was in Christ Christ is in the church manifesting himself in the power of his word and his Revelation you see Paul is saying that we praise that the wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him would do something it would Open the Eyes of our understanding and we would be enlightened or illuminated with the word of God what if the word begin to really illuminate you what if illumination really struck you then it would give you understanding of God it would give you understanding of yourself it would give you understanding of who you are and brother there is power in understanding it positionally knowledges amen positionally places the church in maturity and the knowledge Ephesians chapter one of course the eyes of our understanding being and I like Ephesians 1 It's A Beautiful chapter but just after he says your eyes are open do you know what the next verse is sold it holds the exceeding power and the greatness of God which was exhibited in the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ when he was raised up to sit at the right hand of the father and all things were put under his feet now that's where the prophet of God began to put the church in power remember if you're reading Ephesians 1 you're reading Revelations 3 and you're reading and allowed to see an age somebody would overcome laodicea and they would have their eyes opened and they would share in the Throne of almighty god listen if you ever catch the revelation of this message and the spirit of wisdom and Revelation it will put you over your enemy it will put you over the devil it will place you over whatever birth you've had whatever troubles you've had whatever's coming to your life your knowledge of God will exalt you to the right hand of almighty God I'll tell you what friend it's a powerful thing to know that we have not set ourselves here but before we came here God intended for us to sit in this seat and we have been anointed for this time and this generation the eyes of understanding Illuminating the church to knowledge and wisdom and if you're going to see something what you ought to see you ought to see the presence of God you are to see the power of God you want to receive the reality you say how can I see him brother Wayne brother random said to recognize the presence of God is to see promised word manifested and you'll know you're in his presence that is his proof of manifestation of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and listen friends this Bible said we ought to know him and we ought to pray to know him we ought to know him in the power of Resurrection according to Ephesians chapter one I'm just thinking of this that the Bible is telling us that if we would know the Lord that we would increase an understanding and the vastness so Holy Ghost boldness would be released in the church by that knowledge see the knowledge of God is more than just a book understanding the knowledge of God is knowing that if God said it God can do it the god that we serve created the heavens and the Earth and if he said you can take the land I promise you can take the lamb if God said the Wall fall the wall will fall amen if you know God you know that you can just listen to his word and there's a God there that can manifest his word no matter the situation so Holy Ghost boldness begins to be released in you you begin to believe for impossible things you believe that things that were completely impossible has become possible isn't that powerful someone that really knows God they know this is impossible but it's possible because there's a God Amen it's not that we're trying to act like things are not there that are or we're not trying to act like things that ain't there are going to be there but confession like Abraham said the things that are not they are in the things that are they are not because everything has to come into the word of God we're going to move from glory to glory friends we're going to see the mighty exploits of God we're going to know him beyond the current measure of our knowing the limitations begin to come off you you if you if you are of limited God you have limited to the believer if you've limited God you have limited to the believer if you have limited your God you can go no higher than the gods you know but when God wanted to be introduced to this generation he sent Malachi for he did not send an educated man he sent a humble man that let God in the pillar of fire and came back and told this church he's a living Lord Jesus and he's every bit of his word is still the truth you know what matters who introduces a man don't you it matters who introduces you you know I used I got a good friend brother Matt McLaren he's a world he's actually a world champion pistol shot 1991 he won the world shoot I mean the word World chewed and when I first knew him I knew he was Sean and Jonathan Martin's brother-in-law amen nice guy sitting there kind of quiet and one day somebody said well you know brother Matt here he he won and I get to looking the guy up and he's he's known all over the world I've been having coffee with him for days I have no clue who this guy is and somebody finally introduces me and and you know what I found out amen he had another level to him that I wasn't getting it all but he was he was somebody I was sitting in the presence with a very famous man didn't have no clue who he was and you know there's people in this generation that does not know that Jesus Christ is alive they don't know him more than just a church ethic or some social Gathering they don't know him more than just somebody they've read about or something is looked but there is a way in this generation that we have been introduced to the god of the Bible the same Lord Jesus William Branham introduced us to the same Lord Jesus not a Jesus of yesterday not of Jesus yourself tomorrow but the Jesus of today the same Jesus that was in the Bible has been introduced in this generation and you can know him and you can meet him in the power of his resurrection now brother Branham in the Paradox in 64 he said this I want to know him and to know him is to have life I don't want to be a smart man I want to know him he said Paul said I want to know him and the power of his resurrection isn't amazing somebody one time can you imagine arguing scripture with brother Branham and they said brother Brandon problem you is you just don't know your Bible very well he said yes but I know the author very good amen and I tell you if you're going to know one or the other wouldn't you want to know the author of The Bible amen if you know the author of The Bible you've got life to know the word without the author the Bible said the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen you can take this word and kill people you could and the Bible talks about people that are twice dead and plucked up you know what I figured out that is that's people that are dead and religion has killed them dead dead you know amen they were dead if People's dead in the world at least they got hope there's Grace or there's something to save them or something to help them but if they get religion they get dead dead you know they get embalmed with embalming fluid of that there's no hope for tomorrow there's no way to change there's nothing that can happen but William Branham did not introduce that kind of God to us he did not introduce us to a God just of the letter but he introduced us to the god of creation and anointing and power that was able to change lives I I want to know him but I want to know him by his word brother Adam said but see the thing is to know him by this word that's all right but it's a long ways from being sufficient to know him by the word we've got to know him by the person of his resurrection let me ask you who knew him better by the word than Paul did but Paul knew the word so well he was fighting the resurrected Jesus and didn't even know it his Zeal was fighting the anointing by the written word but one day he met him in the person and when he met him his life was changed amen God Amen God come to him and changed his life and then Paul said I have known him amen he was seen of them but last of all he was seen of me and Paul didn't see him in the in the human body in his resurrection he saw him in the pillar of fire I'm on church amen do you know you've met him like Paul met him we met him like Paul met him in this generation at Gentile churches to meet him in the pillar of fire you don't know the pillar of fire is still here amen the pillar of fire always accompanies the message of the hour amen our God is not dead he's not somewhere in a tomb somebody said how do you think the pillar fires Jesus well Paul met him he said Lord who are you he said I'm Jesus and brother man said now we now have amen the photograph I don't know where it's at now but we now have the photograph amen of the supernatural Angel of the Lord over William branham's head of course it was the same Lord Jesus the Same Lord Jesus because he wants to be made known now the prophet of God and you must be born again said the true word comes to a true prophet and he tells you the true word and you follow the true word and you get a true experience of the word because the word is made flesh in you and you become God's son and the word of God is revolving right out of you God into you because you are his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of God the Bible said so isn't that something now A True Believer does not have to work up being a Believer he's just a believer amen they don't have to work themselves into it they don't have to beat themselves into it they're just Believers that's what they are they just believe and and the things of God the works of God follow the Believers of God now you know the scriptures is telling us then there is an experience with God now it's a powerful thing because really if you've ever experienced God it's not just a one and done right amen people say to me uh brother Wayne tell us about your experience I say which one amen because I did have one and then I had another one and then I had another one and I just had a couple on the way down here to preach these meetings so so my experience with God has never stopped and listen friend if your experience with the Lord is quit amen it's time to reacquaint yourself with a resurrected Lord Jesus amen to bring him in your car bring him in your home bring him in your life he is alive and wants to fellowship with his church amen now now the prophet will say something in the message Feast of the trumpets years ago I remember somebody's telling me stay away from this sermon that it would confuse me well you know what I always found that the real good stuff is under the Scarecrow amen the real good fruits where they tell you stay away from that that's first place I want to go so what what are they trying to keep me out of you know but uh in the Feast of the trumpets brother Bradham actually brother Brown says something that's so powerful it's a powerful sermon altogether but here in one of them he says this now of course we're in the Book of Daniel right and brother man was talking about the Messiah and he said now the people that's believing him how will they know it unless they're constantly in the word see see to know what he is see the wise shall know but the foolish and unwise wouldn't know him now you know where he's at he's in Daniel 12 now he said the wise shall know but the foolish and unwise wouldn't know they shall know their God look at this now he's in Daniel 11. they shall know their God now he shall appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word so the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen that's why there has to be a messenger that's why there has to be a prophet and I don't have time to preach on Feast of trumpets tonight but let's let's get real quickly let's say this Feast of trumpets to Israel was the trumpet sounding under Eichmann and Hitler persecution putting Israel back in its Homeland right the Feast of trumpets to the bride was the opening of Seven Seals the that calls the bride back to their Homeland what the trumpets done for Israel the seals done for the bride it calls them into their for ordained position that God had in this mind concerning the church so the prophet is telling us this message has to sound so the bride will know her husband now there's a lot of people thinks that when Jesus returns that they're going to go meet him and then they're going to go meet their husbands and they think like this but the image they have of Jesus is so different than the word image that they've already missed him and don't even know it amen but but the prophet is saying he will appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word so that they the bride will know her husband know her mate do you know your mate is the revealed word of the hour and the husband of the church is the message of the hour it's the word that's been revealed that's why it's a headship that's why it's a Capstone message it's because it's the headship it's the it's the one that we're married to this new anointed word we have married to this anointed word and the bride shall know her mate amen now I want to re-read that Daniel 11 and watch what it says there in Daniel 11. he says it very clearly he says that the the the the the the the people of God shall be strong and do great exploits right the people shall be strong and do great exploits brother random is re-saying that for you I love how he does it sometimes he's not adding or taking he's resaying the scripture so you can catch it listen to him he said they shall know their God now when he's in Daniel 11 32 they shall know their God he shall appear in the last days to bring the people back to the word there it is the people shall know their God now look at this next thing he says here the bride will know her husband the people now in his word is the bride amen the people shall know their God the word God now brother random has changed for husband the people shall know their God is the bride will know her husband the revealed word of the hour that is the maid of the church if they ever know him they will go in strength they will get powerful people they will they will get a strength from him because they know the god of the Bible is the god that has promised to become the husband of the church in the end time that's why this has to happen so the bride will know her husband know her how many knows him tonight how many knows him tonight now of course Daniel was speaking of the end time in Daniel chapter 12. and you you can look and see it in the ninth verse the Bible said the words are closed and sealed to the time of the end and many shall be purified and made wide and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly boy that's true huh the wicked shall do wickedly anybody got any doubt that they're doing it the wicked shall do wickedly they are doing their job perfectly and none of the wicked shall understand isn't that something and they shall not understand but the wise shall understand so now the people of Daniel 11 is the wise of Daniel 12 is the wise version of Matthew 25 and she's the wise man of Ephesians chapter five what are we talking about we're talking about the same people described many different ways in the Bible you're not just in one place in scripture you're all over the Bible because you're a part of the word that is to manifest in the end time do you see the wise shall understand now if you're a Bible student you know that Revelations 22 speaks of the moment that he meets the angel he wants to worship that John says he heard him say unseal the book right Daniel over there in Daniel he said he'll seal it up to the end and then the wife shall understand Revelations 10 says until it up to the seventh angel and revelation 22 said an angel came to him and said it's time to unseal the book well amen that's pretty clear isn't it unseal the book but then it said the wicked shall the righteous shall be righteous and the unrighteous shall be your unrighteous steal but the wise shall understand so there's a spirit of wisdom released with the opening of the word of God it's not just that God opened the word he released the spirit of wisdom upon the church that they might see and identify that this is God my when I think about this he said the wise shall understand Ephesians chapter 5 we're forced he saith awaken thou that sleepest and to rise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see them that you want circumspectly not as fools but as wise now look at the beauty of this Redeeming the time because the days are evil now watch what Paul says wherefore be ye not unwise you hear Brother Branham talk about this a lot of times he says don't don't be unwise don't be the unwise Virgin amen now the foolish version is in Matthew 25 but the unwise is in Ephesians 5 and he's saying but be and not unwise but an understanding know what the will of the Lord is now in the message of adoption brother Adam will tell us this he said the other day I took this word in Mystery in scripture and it began to pack me back in the Old Testament then put me over in the New Testament and tied something together see the mystery of his coming three things the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will and the Mystery of us setting together there's three things you're catching you're going to catch the mystery of his coming the mystery of his wheel and the Mystery of us setting together he said by the way all that's in the message absolutely absolutely it's in the midst do you you see the great mystery of his coming that's released under this message it's not the coming for the Millennium it's the coming for the carrying away of the church so the church has got to be caught up in the mystery of the hour which is the seventh seal it's the mystery ever going it's the mystery of rapture and the Mystery of body change but to catch it you got to catch the mystery of his coming you say the mystery of his coming yes it's Elohim see the mystery of Elohim is what has been given to this Joshua generation you say hello him yes that's what come to Abraham remember when Elohim took a body and spoke to Abraham as the word and discerned their hearts and he's called his name Lord Brother Brown said was he Lord he said Abraham called him God he said then he proved he was God when he said where's Sarah thy wife and Abraham said she's in the tent behind me he said see there's the proof that he was talking to the Lord the word is a discerner of the thought until the heart why did he discern there why was the discernment there brother Brown said was building a sign so he built the sign in the days of Abraham Jesus read the book of Genesis and said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man then Elohim has been predicted to return in the last days and the Mystery of Elohim has shown us that God himself would take human bodies in the end time and we've seen the proof of it there's over 8 300 times on tape where William Branham discerned the thought he told the need he gained my vision exactly what was done in the Book of Genesis and never one time did anybody say brother Branham that's wrong and every time they said it was true because it was the spirit of truth that was bringing the Revelation to the church that is Jesus that's here it wasn't the man William ran him he took a temporary resurrection and God used his body to bring that revelation of the coming of the Lord to the church it was Elohim that was coming what does this mean Elohim is back in the flesh come on church and this ain't just God with us this ain't now I'm saying God With Us come on this is Matthew the 28th chapter I'll be with you even in you until the end of the ages John 14 because highly of ye live also and in that day you shall know that I am and the Father the father of me and I and you my goodness what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is he's alive and you're alive and the Elohim coming is showing us the same God he's just changing masks hey man you're the generation that knows he's not three Gods he's one God but he said God with the same nature he just changes his mask and in the last days he promised to appear to us in the form of the Bride of Jesus Christ come on church for you that look for his appearing the second time you shall see it with sin without sin under salvation if you knew what you're looking at as he said to the woman at the well if you knew you was talking to you would ask for me if if you have identified what this word is you would say God fill me with it tonight fill me with your quickening power the Living God Has Come Among Us the god of the Bible has awoken and arose and walked into the Church of the Living God and I say arise and awake awaken yourself from the sleep of this laodicea and notify yourself that Elohim has returned among us to make known the mystery of his will Ephesians said he would do it it's adoption that he would make known the mystery of his will that's exactly what he told Abraham the will of God concerning his life the will of God concerning the body change and the prophet of God said of course of course you'll not have the will of God without his word you've got to have Elohim coming to have Elohim restore the word so you can know the will of God and brother Graham said that third revelation of that he said would be the mystery of us sitting together so Ephesians 1 lets us see we're setting with him in Heavenly places and listen that's not a church-aged message friends that's not just through every message to every age Matthew 20 says it wasn't they asked Jesus to set it in the right and left hand he said I can't give it to you because God's already given it to a certain group of people that would be coming in the end time mother Brown said to be granted to that word bride in that last day the Overcomer of laodicea I'm talking about somebody setting with the Throne of God with dominion and power with adoption upon their hearts and upon their life this message ain't just a watered down theological idea it's the power of God that's coming the church to anoint us and identify us for the rapturing of the church it's the Vindication that we're setting with him we're setting that you you could get pretty Evangelical here hey man you could get there if you wanted to but we'll set him with him in the countdown right we're setting with him in the countdown ready for takeoff that's where the church is she sealed away in there you say where's this going to happen I'll tell you what he's here and he's with the church and he's in the church he's not just here he tabernacled in the church and the Bible says that prophecy after prophecy brother Madam said it'll happen in the same time that the stone is going to Smite the image of Babylon and we have seen the rock shoot out of the mountain we have seen the great Capstone revelation of the word smash against the nomination and the people that see that will be people that are wise and they shall know their God and become strong my the strength this message ought to give you the overcoming strength the anointing to rise above every denominational Creed above every teaching of trinitary and false denominational baptisms in order to give you the street to stand if you've got to stand alone then let's stand anyhow because God is Street in the church with the anointing of this word we have seen him we have heard him and we are sitting with him we have sat down with communion with Elohim my feeding for from that bread word drinking the wine I'm talking about communion with Melchizedek we met him on the road Church the battle's over we know who we are we know where we're going we are not struggling tonight wondering what's right and which way to go and what are we going to do amen God has given to us it's in our hands what are we going to do with it I say we ought to tear down the kingdom of hell and establish the kingdom of God in every heart in every life thus saith the Lord there ought to be a word of power and a word of anointing a drive out every doubt and every conflict and every idea of man our young people need some strength Church they need to Holy Ghost strength they need strength of people that know who they are and what they believe in why they believe it we're not just a bunch of lukewarm jellyfish not sure about this I'm not sure about that I'm on somebody's going to know their God all that's going to leave them and it's going to happen in the same time that that rock is hitting that image there's a people that come out of if you watch it long enough you'll see that that that rock will grow into a great Mountain she'll be that great pyramid Mountain that great bride of Christ will come out of that revelation it's not going to quit grow until it takes over friends it happens in that there's going to be a people that follows it Revelations 10 tells us that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God is it okay if I remove this the mystery of God will be finished amen that he hath declared unto his servants the prophets I'm just going to lay it there somebody will have to move it in a minute but amen the mystery of God would be finished according to beginning and ending Gentile dispensation brother Braham said the mystery of God is God in you brother you mean the Creator is going to take flesh and not just any flesh but your flesh have you ever really let that sink down into that heart that God is intending on claiming your flesh brother I tell you it's powerful it's a powerful time it's a powerful generation amen that it's a happening of God in you the hope of glory now the people shall know their God and shall do exploits brother bam ties them two things together the mystery God in you and shall know their God in Ephesian Church age brother Brown says it like this Daniel heard those seven Thunders and were forbidden and John heard the voices in the book and was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with Seven Seals but in the days of those seals to be opened the mystery of God would be finished in other words God would be made known to the church now I know these quotes and there's some things could be taught around them but y'all let's just get the point of it the mystery of God would be finished and in other words God would be known in his church not in three people but in one person he's just one person amen now the mystery of God brother bam said that's it he said to know who the at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is to know what he is how he lives his nature and his being you're supposed to be all the way up here by that time bringing us into a full stature of Sons and Daughters of God a church that's washed in the blood of Christ see it was a great mystery it was a great mystery but brother Branham said sure it's a great mystery but it's all solved now brother I tell you if you did anybody in here study DNA do you all know that they finally solved the language of DNA in other words it was a mystery of the of the numbers and the language and it was the symbols and it was a mystery because it wasn't all solved out it was they were working on it but one point when they finally solved all of it they said okay it's solved now every condition every DNA of man is in this certain number and it might have to be reassorted or have to be split a certain way but it all exists now so they solved it out when William Branham broke the seven seal he solved it out the the message holds the revelation of the entire thing that my goodness it's all in there you want Rapture it's in there you want the healing that's in there you want the power of God it's in there it's all there brother bam said they see that it's all been solved now it's been solved for a purpose God didn't just solve it he solved it for somebody if you ever think about this God knows his word why do you write a Bible for you God knew who he was why did he send the prophet so you would know who he was so the message in for God is for you and it's for you to know God and if you know God it will bring strength into your life amen it'll make you strong now of course in Abraham's Covenant brother Brown tells us about the Covenant and I I know you're a well-taught church so I don't have to teach I'm just going to mention it and move on I know where you're at so but but y'all know that the Covenant that God made with Abraham in Genesis 15 was Jesus Christ Jesus it's a lot of scripture on it but Jesus was the Covenant of God he was the unconditional Covenant he's what God was going to do no matter what Abraham did I will bless the according I Will Bless thee and then Isaac thy seed shall be blessed that was the blessing upon him was the blessing of Jesus Christ and Jesus was the Covenant of God now brother Brown discusses Old Testament covenants he said you lay out a you've got two men making a promise now if me and you made a promise we shook hands on the promise that's our covenant was the handshake God's covenant with man was Calvary all right now what he done was he said like if I was promising to do something you were promising and we laid a dead Beast out in front of us he said now we split the Beast he said in that Beast being split was the confirmation that if either of us broke our word we would be as this dead Beast he said so so you all know what I'm talking about it used to be a covenant was a handshake you know and somebody said well I'll take that car and you give him a hundred dollars you shook a hand if it was a month and you come back car sitting there it's your car right because the handshake was a covenant don't try that now buddy but you can you can buy something on the phone before you get there somebody offered them 10 more dollars is gone because nobody's word's good it's not a covenant a handshake's not a covenant and you got to get it and he can steal it probably got a lawyer and get them out of it but when God made a covenant with man he made it through Jesus Christ that was God's covenant with man now brother Baron said what he does he broke open the body and he said and God took the spirit out of Jesus Christ he said and gave that Spirit to Mankind and he took the body back to heaven where he holds the Corporal body of Jesus as his part of the Covenant and he gave you the spirit as your part of the Covenant so if you're a covenant holder you hold the power of God by his spirit because you're Gentiles right amen the only way you have a connection to God is by the spirit of God which makes you abrahamic Covenant and if you hold the spirit of God everything in God is in the church by his Spirit by his Covenant now the thing he did was he gave you his Spirit brother bam said he took the body now you've got part of the Covenant he got part of the Covenant and he said that Covenant was made with man now the prophet tells us and see not everybody says it like this he said but see that Covenant builds strength as it ages go along it would be like you're making a covenant and saying you say to somebody I'm going to I'm going to give you a million dollars but I'll give you the first 300 000 I'm going to wait 10 years give you another 300 000. I'm gonna wait 10 years until I complete or fully give you the Covenant right so what was up Through the Ages was the Holy Ghost right brother said holy ghost in every age so they got part of their life they got parties all the way up Through the Ages the church ages it was a Son of God dispensation so all the way up through there the Son of God was being ministered by the baptism of the spirit and it was being manifested in that so we got it in justification it wasn't the whole thing but it was the Holy Ghost it wasn't the whole thing but it was the Holy Ghost remember Brotherman said it was an every age but what it was doing was coming to full strength and brother random says it like this he said see but when you can come to say I and my father are one and these other things then the shut pulls away and the real genuine bride church will come forth in the entire word in its fullness and in its strength my he's the same yesterday today and forever you say what are you talking about preacher I'm saying that Pentecost giveth strength to you A lot of people look back to Azusa and they said well if we could have what they have are you kidding me are you kidding me the everything good that was in Martin Luther is in this bride everything good that was him John Wesley is in this bride everything good that was in Azusa Pentecost is in this Bride come on Church the life that produced that was only trying to bring it to the seed and now we don't have part of it we've got the fullness of God through the fullness of his word to the fullness of his people what are we talking about the strength of this message amen is stronger than Pinnacle it's stronger than being justified it's the strength of God coming into the church in the reality of his word now brother Branham says the shut giveth strength into the sea he said it's been a good shot but it served its purpose now it's the wordbride of the word groom you said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about your prophecy now there's a people that shall know their God the bride will know the revealed word the prophet gave us the revealed word so you could fulfill Daniel 11. but it also says she will be strong so where does the strength of this Bride come from Brother Bynum says that he said see see the shot giveth strength to the seed Amen in other words the life that was in the plant has been dumped out into the seed and the Covenant that God made by the church has come to full strength I don't have time to teach on it I hope you know what I'm talking about but the son of man come full and Elohim when Elohim come to Abraham it was the word in dust right it was the son of man in the father age then the son of man came in the sun age of Jesus Christ stood there as the son of man and fully manifested God in the sun dispensation but in the Holy Ghost dispensation the son of man has never been manifest and in the last days the fullness of the son of man is to be manifested under the ages and God would step down into this bride and breathe life and shrieked into this church straight for Rapture strength for anointing straight to overcome Amen in this weak and wicked age strength has been promised said preacher what do you say and I'm saying the Bible said amen strength I love David y'all like David Dave is a powerful writer I'm a I'm I pay attention to the rider I if I'm reading the scripture I say who wrote this because I think sometimes it has a inflection of the man doing the writing and David David says in Psalms 28 he said for the Lord is strength in my shield now if there's anybody had a right to to to to read that and write that and to sing that David a line killer a bear killer a boy a ruddy boy lion killer Goliath killer he said for the Lord is my strength it's not my muscles it's not my intellect the Lord is my strength and he's my shield and my heart is trusted in him and I am helped therefore my hurt gladly rejoicing my song will I praise him the Lord is their strength isn't it powerful he is the saving strength of the anointed you say well I don't know how that person keeps going it's the Lord keep moving it's the Lord how you walk you walk right in the most wicked age it's the Lord for the Lord is my strength listen David says it like this in Psalms 84 I love this Psalm and y'all forgive me if I get a little carried away reading David it just it just bubbles my heart blessed is the man whose strength is in me David said if a man has God is his strength that's a blessed man hey you talk about strength that don't run out in your old age you're talking about strength that don't run out in weary times you can the Bible said amen that it would teach you how to run and not become weary you can walk and you cannot faint because the strength of the Lord comes into the Church of the Living God blessed is a man who strength is in thee I love some of these types that David said he said we're passing through the valley of baka make it away on the rain filleth the pools and they go from strength to strength now you if you studied that scripture the valley Baka it's really not an actual Valley it's a it's a figure of speech it's talking about dry places it's talking about a man walking Gavin the Blues he's going through a bad time and he said but the Valley of Baca God will make it a whale if he's your strength you can get in the driest place come on it was bad it was a it was uh therein Bathsheba wasn't it that they actually named The Well when ham when Hagar amen she juggle well and she said he's the Lord that seeth and heareth me he knows me it's not just you no God God knows you and he knows you by vain you're not going to strengthen the church to know that when they're walking through the valley of the Baka that God will make a whale there and they fill the pools you can't dry up a Church of the Living God because they got an Artesian well coming now come on little church what makes your bubble is it the deer drinking no sir amen is it the squirrel drinking no sir but there's something on the inside that just keeps bubbling out of the church because God has put something in her she's an Artesian whale she's a Fountain of Life I know the prophecy concerning you a river of Living Water shall flow out of thy belly for he that has the strength now the Bible said he would move from strength to strength that troubled me strength of strength what's that even mean you ever think about that move strength to strength and I got to look at it up and I thought my goodness it's got to have a better somebody gotta somebody got to say it different for this hillbilly to catch it so I got into that uh I got into that uh Amplified Bible is that okay to quote here that Amplified Bible and they just said something real good they didn't change it they just said it different and it caught me they said go from strength to strength increasing in Victorious power I said Ah that's it hey man when a man when his strength is coming from the Lord he just goes from power to power he goes from Victory to Victory he's increasing listen now when I I preached this and my wife asked me she said you know she knows she said hon she said you know you preaching the church is getting stronger she said you know there's been a lot of Trials there's been a lot of Trials and I said that's right hun we got to talking about it and the lord gave me something I I was just saying I'm sorry I'm simple God's got to show me real simple way and I got to looking at it and I got to thinking about back before covet y'all remember that back before covid you know that really was before covid that was there was a time called before covid when everything was wonderful restaurants were good you could get a meal you know and it was a different world y'all know what I'm talking about hey man but but you know some of you were sitting in church back then before all this stuff before all the separations and trouble before before the believe the sign movement and before all the critics rose up and ever you know your mom talking about right and some of you were saying back then Lord I don't know if I'm gonna make it till tomorrow some of you backed me and you remember probably you remember certain services or certain times well you said Lord I'm so beat I'm so tired this job or this this situation at home or this problem in the church I don't know if I'm going to make tomorrow but after after believe the sign after kovid after two crazy years of of everything that can hit you you're sitting here tonight you are stronger now than you have ever been you are getting stronger every day listen the church ain't getting weaker the church is getting stronger and then you say well brother Wayne I'm barely making it but look how far you've made it look where you're at you're standing here in the most wicked of all ages and you're still walking and you're still believing and you're still press it and you're here on a Friday night serving God stronger and she's going to continue to get stronger see what it is it's a spirit that's upon you now you know there's types in the Bible and one of the types of the church brother by Adam said in the remember the member of the letter to the church when he comes over there and he says he picked up the pin and spoken word Original Seed and he wrote and he said as we come near The Headstone remember she'll she'll get less in minority but she'll get stronger in anointed or stronger in power she'll be a stronger Church she won't be as many but it'll be stronger remember that prophecy amen but there's another prophecy he said that there will come a messenger in the end time that will tie Joshua he said and there'll be another name Caleb he said who is a follower of Joshua amen so so there's two spirits that in the days of Moses when they left Egypt and they come over into the promised land do you know there's only two that came out they came out and went in only two Joshua and Caleb and you'll either have to have the spirit of Joshua or Caleb Joshua was the end-time messenger so we don't have Joshua's Spirit we're not Joshua but we are Caleb and any believer sitting here tonight is a Caleb in the scripture and what Caleb did now I I like I said I'm that guy I want to see who David's talking about David said we're going to get stronger I'm thinking who was David thinking about when he's saying stuff like this because David David's thinking about somebody what's David thinking about he's got some examples that he's looking at in the scripture and the whole tribe of Israel knows about this 85 year old man Caleb who decided at 85. he'd come walking in his sister he says to Joshua we said look I'm stronger today for war than I've ever been now I don't know if he was stronger than he ever been but he was Stronger for war than he had ever been he was ready to fight right then just as much as he ever was ready to fight you know I think about men of God like our brother Sam Dale sitting here tonight amen he's stronger now for a war that he's ever been amen there's something on the inside of that man amen listen this message is real this message is powerful he's come through a lot of crazy stuff for a lot of years but there's something on the inside of our elders listen I don't despise our elders I thank God for our elders amen they're what holds up the corners of the building and we got testimonies that God ain't just good to a 15 year old and God ain't just good to 20. but amen he shows that in the late parts of life that the power of this message is still just as real then as it was then and this man Caleb was more Ready for War then and you know what he said to you Joshua he said I want I want what Moses said I could have that's right now that's pretty powerful isn't it amen the strength of Caleb was that he wanted what was promised him now I tell you I think I I do y'all identify right there do you all identify that something has been promised to you and you want what God promised you you you're telling you're telling the spirit of the Lord I want what God said I could have that's all I don't want somebody else's portion I don't want what Israel's got I don't want what the messengers have got I don't know if what the other people were supposed to do I want what God promised me in this end time because brother let me tell you that's plenty that's plenty and Caleb was able to go over in that land do you know what Caleb was asking for I don't have time to read all this would it be okay if I preach it you're taught you know what's right amen do you know what you know what Caleb was asking for he was asking for land he had walked on 40 years ago when Moses sent him over to spy the land uh Caleb walked the land of Judah he was he was a spy from the tribe of Judah which is a powerful thing and I I don't want to take you down a long Rabbit Trail but I think it's pretty uh pretty well known among the church amen that Caleb was a gentile originally right but how did that Gentile get to be that now notice they said 12 over and when they when they when they cast lots to see whose portion belong where Caleb was identified as a leader of Judah to find the property that belonged to them and he was a gentile can you imagine he was a gentile and I said Lord God Amen how did that Gentile get so embedded in that promise that he was the man that went over and walked the ground and then I noticed what tribe was from he was from the tribe of Judah brother amen if he was from the tribe of Judah he said Preacher what's that mean to us amen that means that tribe that let Rahab in was the tribe of Judah that tribe that led Tamar amen come in like that that was the Triangle she was a Jew but look at how she become part of the seed line amen that was what happened to Ruth she was brought in under the tribe of Judah listen Church the bride church is brought in under the line of the tribe of Judah Jesus Christ it's the tribe amen oh God come on there's no priesthood coming out of that tribe but not of the Aaron priests but there's another order that's a Melchizedek corner and that's the order the church has come under him a young time my goodness of possession and an inheritance in the promises of God under the lion of Judah under Jesus Christ has made you and put you into that lamp and the same thing came Caleb did when he looked at that land and he come back and all of them was looking at the Giants and they said we can't do it and brother Mann said now there's a big difference between Caleb and the other spies he said they were looking at the Giants and Caleb was looking at the promises and I tell you there's a there's a spirit that's resting on the Church of the Living God Amen the world is looking at the giant they're looking at the problem they're looking at the situation but the bride church is looking at the promises of God and there's something Rising about of the ministry saying we are more than able to take this land we can take it we can do it because God said we can do it do you see only Caleb went in under Joshua if you're going to go in you can only go in by looking at the promises of God and look at I kind of laughed I kind of laugh when I think about this I laugh about where in the world did those giants live is in that land when Caleb went after his land he didn't just go after any land brother he went after the real land hey man those giants took over the best land I've asked this just so you can really understand this point uh if there's a guy six four and 280 pounds walked in a room where is he set where he wants to he says where he wants to and where did the Giants live where they wanted to and then the best parts of the land was around the tribe of Judah and that Judah that Judah y'all know what Judah stands for it stands for praise do you know where the best you know where the big giants move in they move into praise they move into worship they move into the power of God and those giants move in to hold the children of God out but you'll never Hulk hate about you'll never hold Caleb out of that land because he knows it belongs to him by the promises of God and as long as he knows it's his he's going to go take that land and the Bible tells us of course Caleb did it and he was strengthened to believe it even in his old age come on y'all know y'all know y'all know that Abraham got stronger as he got older Bible said he didn't grow weak but he grows strong in faith amen he was nursing from El shadiah from the promises of God how is this bride getting stronger the age is getting harder the things are getting worse problems are getting how you're going to get stronger because you're nursing from El shadia you're hooked into the blessings of God by the promises of God you're nursing you're nursing it back of course strengthened I know this Bible said if you wait upon the Lord you shall renew your strength well let me ask you how long we're going to wait come on church I'm not just saying this how long are we going to wait before we recognize that the Lord has come Among Us we waited but with the waiting is over the time has arrived I say high time for the Church of the Living God to recognize who it is that's Among Us the same God that defeated Giants in the days of Caleb is here to defeat Giants in the days of the Church of the Living God he said preacher what are you trying to do get us to tackle a giant absolutely I'm trying to get you to tackle every giant that says you can't do it every giant that says there's no more healing kill that giant with the sword of the word of God pick your sword up and fight back have the strength the prophet of God gave us a third pull message and he said it was a sword of the Lord he said but it matters the hand it gets into whether it has the strength of the faith to hold that sword and I believe if you're nursing from this promise you believe you can do anything any place through Christ because God said you can he said preacher what are we supposed to do well I think we're ought to take some action yeah sorry I think we are I think we ought to get away from this passive faith and get back into an action well to get back from just learning what's about and put it in action come on Church there was six wings he humbled himself he was reverent but he had to fly and I'll tell you this the church has to get into action with the word of God come on we're not just hearers of this word we're doers of this word y'all believe that of that word can I can I give you the scripture here in Daniel 11. let me just re rehearse this to you the people that know their God who am I talking to now the people that who am I talking to tonight the the people that know their God you know our God tonight do you know him then they shall be strong come by somebody said I'm strong I'm strong why are you strong because I know God he's revealed himself in this age strength has come into the church amen and you say well I'm strong but the Bible said you're going to do exploits that's a powerful word isn't it exploits exploit it's a powerful word exploits now you don't want that word actually it's got several definitions but one of them I want I want to just take for a moment as we're getting kind of getting wound up here to close amen one of them actually means action exploit means action exploit means actions it it's and they shall have action they'll be strong and they'll be doers of the word of God do you know what the prophet said in God's provided lamb 1964. he said now he will how will he be made known he we will know him by his nature and what he does and how he works he said I am the vine and you are the branches and the branch Bears the fruit not the vine the vine energizes the branch he said and if the branch ever brings forth a Vine it'll bring forth a branch it has a grape on it the next Vine comes out the branch of the vine there'll be grapes on it if the first church that come off of that vine was a Pentecostal church with the gifts if that ever really puts forth another Branch they'll write another book of Acts behind it and that's what they had in the days of the Apostles and the apostolic age has never ended isn't that powerful this isn't that a prophet see and they shall have actions and brother random says if the bride ever puts forth if God ever brings forth that Bride come on church I'm not talking to a future people he said the alpha has become the Omega I'm looking at it it's not it's not there's going to be a virtuous sinless bride brother man said you are The Virtuous sinless bride so we've arrived there I'm not talking to another group I'm not talking to Moses or even brother Branham I'm not even talking to their age I'm not talking to some future super generation that's coming I'm talking to you tonight I don't know if there's 10 days left church I believe it's now I believe we are the people of the Bible I believe this is the generation of promise I believe it I believe I have a right to believe it and if it ever happens brother man said it'll be a continuation in the book of Acts how many knows the book of Acts never was finished because it's the acts of God in the apostles it's the acts of God in the apostles and God is still acting in the church it will be a cue Church Revelation book it'll be a true church the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts that's right it's a continuation in the book of Acts her actions will be God moving through the church now watch this the it's a powerful thing it's not only action but exploit speaks it speaks of military maneuvering like if you like Russia's they're having exploits over there shock and awe you know they're bombing and they're they're in exploits they're sending their military out they're doing Maneuvers they're exploits they're actions they're not just got missiles they're shooting them ain't just got armies they're sending them into action it's exploits brother man uh of course uh one of the definitions actually says at a large-scale military accent uh exercise now of course the Bible is telling us that the wicked shall do wickedly so they're acting right the wicked shall do wickedly so they're acting but the wise shall know their God and they shall do exploits now if you see that the church begins to do exploits listen these this Church of the Living God has got that Caleb anointing on them and when they look at the situation now I don't have enough time to preach this so I'm just going to say it and move on but I don't care what you're doing if you're in church you're dealing with Giants you got a song service there's Giants and a song service it would be reasons to not have one sometimes sometimes you got to kill some Giants sure there's there's Giants and hearing preachers somebody said well you should just play tapes there's your giant but you got to kill a giant to enjoy the word right there's Giants there's Giants and everything amen but it's according to the promises of God so somebody said there's healing brother Adam said it like this he said see that when Caleb and Joshua went in the land and they come back with evidence of milk and honey he said the milk and honey was the healing in the land he said the giant that was in the land was that person that claimed their healing and didn't get it so you've got to overcome that giant to take the of the milk and honey that come out of there it was the evidence of it see and every in every purpose and everything God has there is an absolute Giant in that land now if you're talking about the spoken word how many of you know people that have so misused name it claim it they've so misused positive thinking and just say it and just confess it and and they made it like somehow that you could operate outside of the will of God come on Church y'all know very well that Jesus was asked of the the devil to cast down the bread Stone and make it into bread and Jesus wouldn't do it because he was showing you the power of God is not to be operated to show off for the devil brother Brown said it clearly he said he wouldn't make the devil's bread I like that he wouldn't make bread for the devil but later he took a he took a little boy's lunch and fed five thousand to show he could do it but he didn't do it for the devil he'd done it for his father so the Church of the Living God must know that there's all kinds of things that happen but the inheritance of this church the inheritance of this bride there is a portion of this am I okay on time y'all okay he told me y'all was a three-hour church so I'm only going to go about an hour right they'll all love you later brother now this is a 14-point sermon and I'm in point three I'm not going to go to 14. I'm just teasing uh a good friend of mine said it like this brother Dave sawley's preaching one day and he says he said can I have another five minutes and he looks around the congregation he said anybody give me five minutes uh just go ahead and raise your hand anybody give me five minutes to raise your hand 5 10 15 20 25. come on hands yeah it tricked you didn't I but see there's an inheritance in the church you got to see what what's the inheritance is what is the land that we're looking for what's the place of our what's the place that we've been birthed to possess that's what we're some reason you're born there's a there's an anointing and action that comes upon the church and and you know I see Caleb taking his Mountain now if you say what's Caleb's mountain today well when brother Brandon was here he showed us Seven Peaks in a mountain remember and he spelled his name he said and there were Seven Peaks spelled the name Branham did anybody ever realize that God changed Abram's name to Abraham making it seven letters projecting seven letters those mountains were already there folks so so God changed Abraham's name to seven letters because there was another name on his mind that ended in ham before Abraham was right he was already talking about this message and give it the ham seven letters in the Peaks brother man said three of them Peaks and they said the last one was the highest showing the last climax remember where it struck in the Continental Divide remember it's either this way or that he said after that Peak he said there's nothing it goes right on out into the desert he said it's the last Peak it's the last mountain look at Abraham's Last Mountain it was in Genesis 22 when he went up with Isaac and there Jehovah Jireh showed up and he found the Animal by creative spoken word and what was the last peak of brother branham's name it was the spoken word he said there was that third pull now Church of the Living God I'm one preacher that don't believe that the third pool was just for somebody else I believe the third pull is for the Bride of Jesus Christ somebody said to me one day he said brother brother Wayne if you believe we had a third pool was our first two I said well the first two was ministered by an Angel in the cave and it had to do with a sign and a hand and the prophecy of discerning of Hearts it has nothing to do with us it was a Vindication of a prophet's message but the third poll was the opening of the word which gave us our identification and fed the bride Church into becoming who she is brother how can we not be the third pull the third pool created us we are the Vindication of it everything about it has become the church now of course that third poll if you if you're going to go up on that mountain the best mountains got the biggest Giants and somebody's going to say you can't enter there you can't go on that land you can't be there and I say they're intellectual Giants I say they never have believed God but if a man really believes God this bride can walk in the land of the third pool She's On That Mountain friends because God has given her that inheritance to go there that inheritance was anointed to us I got a section on inheritance I'm going to skip it amen there's an anointing that comes upon them and the prophet of God said our inheritance was our names written in the Lamb's Book of Life right and that inheritance is our names written and it's the portion that God has anointed us to have do you all know this is the only age that Lamb's Book was opened in so millions of peoples in the Lamb's Book of Life but you know your names in the Lamb's Book of Life why would God do that to bring a perfect faith that you would perfectly know who you are you would perfectly know he's your father and you could stand against anything the devil threw at you and know it belongs to you by the promise of almighty god listen let me say this brother bam said this may choke you to death but did you know that men that are Sons and Daughters of God are amateur gods how many ever know that Jesus said it in the Bible did not the law itself say that you are gods and then Genesis 2 he made man to be a god did he not and brother Madam says it like this I love it he said we're waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when full sons of God will be manifested anybody anybody know he's talking about you when full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out Hallelujah and we'll take every Power that Satan's got away from him brother brother brother I'm talking about you think you're just some little weakling you think you're just somebody that just barely making it and you're barely getting in Devil's been lying to you you are the people that know your God and have been anointed to do exploits in the last day and the devil's trying to talk you out of it he's trying to talk you into sitting down and being quiet and don't get involved and don't you claim your inheritance don't you claim your rights well listen let me tell you what I don't care what the devil thinks I've got a right to an inheritance of the power of the third pool I'm going to claim my children and the devil I don't care for the airlift every demon in Hell amen I'm gonna claim my god-given inheritance and what God gave me and stand on that word with a sword of Faith because God said I could have it and brother random says you'll take every Power that Satan's got away from him yes sir he said how can we do that in the angel in his commission brother Brown said this and then you can go hit Satan with a scripture and he gets as powerless as he can be do you know why you got to know the word because that's what you hit the devil with that's right it's written church it's not what you overcome it's how you overcome and you put the word in the hand of a believer that knows this blend belongs to them they can take the word and beat the devil off of every bit of the property that God gave to them do you know the Bible said that God called you Gods now I I I'm sorry this this scripture gets it it illuminates so powerful to me when the Bible said in Mark 11 if you say unto this mountain you all know that scripture if you say unto this mountain and you don't doubt in your heart and you tell it to be moved it'll be cast in the sea that's a powerful scripture isn't it but when you hear when you hear Jesus when you hear Brother Bradham quote it back listen to the difference the way he says it he said see he made man a God in dominion and it goes from sea to Sea from Shore to Shore and he has control of it and when Jesus came being the one God without sin now there's no not enough time to preach that quote he was the only little god without sin do you see what he's saying he come into little god statue God came into Humanity and he was the only god without sin and being an amateur God upon the Earth he spoke and he did it and brother man said look at this he was the one God without sin and he proved it he said when the winds blowed he said peace be still and when he said to the tree don't eat from these he said verily I say unto you little gods I say unto you little Gods if you'll say unto this mountain and now when Jesus said he said I say unto you if you say brother Ram switches it says I say unto you little gods see God created you in the beginning to be that and the fall took it away from you but this is the age of restoration and the Bible is predicting the people that know their God shall return to the street and the knowledge of the word and by doing so they will take action they will take military action how could you know what you know and let the devil take over come on friend how could you know what you know as a father and let the devil take over your home how could you know what you know as a preacher and let the devil take over the church brother I tell you what the devil I have a handful if he comes into one of these churches if he comes into one of these homes he's got a handful because the people know they're gone do you see they will take action and the Bible says I say unto you for this is the manifestation of the sons brother Ram said the manifestations of son true Sons born son field Sons if they take speak the word their word is backed if they speak the word the word is backed I love this quote here brother Brown said I believe there's a church on the road tonight but I love this quote here brother bam said I believe there's a church on the road tonight a power of the Living God that men will speak the word and it'll flash like lightning a church is coming out not psychologists not some put on or make believe but a real true genuine anointed Holy Ghost God called Church brother speak the word and it'll flash like lightning isn't that powerful it'll manifest right before them the prophet of God said see he has no eyes but mine and yours he has no hands but mine and yours he energizes us and he brings forth life and brings us through whether it's by the preaching of the Gospel by lip or it's sin Vision by eye whether it is the lane on the hands of the sick whatever it is it's Christ working through the branches of his church and every office literally electrified by his presence my goodness I sometimes you just feel I have to be honest you're preaching you feel like about a 4 000 vote to just just electrified what is it it's the power of God it's his word speaking and casting Spirits from the mind of the people telling the hey look if you take this word in hand it'll defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition it'll come through the branches of this church do you know that brother Branham actually says you're living in an age when your thoughts will become material hey if anybody ever needed the mind of the lord we need it he said you're living in a time when the thought would become material do you know in the fifth seal brother bran says this he said I believe the hours approach him when missing limbs will be added Miss and limbs will be restored of the glory the Creator I believe if you make said a man or woman's got a missing part the complete animal itself hey man there's a there's a season we're living in he said preacher what are you talking about can I can I share with you if you go read this part in the fifth seal do you all know what he you know why he says this because he just prayed for a little girl with leukemia in the back room and he says now for God to heal that little girl he had to recreate the blood cell he said so it was a creation of the blood cell in there he said if God can do that to heal that leukemia he said then I believe we're living in a season he could add a Liam back now y'all say well that happened in the days of brother random you know I it literally over there in Norway back about six seven years ago I was preaching a sermon on the Seven Stars I was in the Norway convention with brother parrots or summer camp meeting and one of the evenings I'm preaching on the Seven Stars and I just took the Thunders and opened the I opened the symbols and instead of saying unto the star of the Ephesus age I just said unto Paul and under iranius and I was just reading the Bible like it would have been written if the Thunders hadn't sealed it but once it's released the seals is off now you can read the book right right and I get to the seven star and I said nobody has a problem with it mother six stars it's a seven star that all hails against and unto the angel of the church allowed to say so read it the way it's written and unto William Branham I write brother Adam may call the devil's mad won't it amen but I'll tell you what happened there was a lady sitting in that meeting that had been suffering with leukemia for about two years she was very weak barely could get into the meetings I seen her earlier that day and she was telling me how bad she'd been praying God with a Healer amen she was sitting in that meeting a year later I seen her at that same meeting she come and got me and set me down in the lunchroom and she said brother Lawson I've been waiting a year to tell you this she said you remember preaching on them Seven Stars last year I said yeah I remember that sis she said when you named William Branham as that seven star she said that was a Warmness moved over me from the top of my head to the bottom of my listen to me friends I didn't have my hand on her I didn't have her in a prayer life and I believe in prayer lines you know I do amen but I was preaching the word of God and there was an anointing that struck that woman and she was healed from the top of her head to the bottom of her feet because we are in the season when the word of God is creative and it's anointing and it's power amen right now are in the building leukemia was healed it's a preacher that only happened one time not to me I was another person sitting in my meetings one day and they were sitting there with a tumor right there a man with a tumor on his breast he'd been fighting it for weeks or maybe even a year by that time and they had it covered up and I started testifying about God healing cancer and in the middle of it by the way he stuck his hand in his shirt sitting right there and he stood in his feet said brother Lawson the thing has just disappeared off of my chest amen it wasn't an unusual service it was a service just like this but there was an anointing in that building and let me say this that God that healed cancer one time can he heal cancer again the god that spoke squirrels can speak squirrels again the miracle working God is in this building and we know him to be God we know him to be full of his Mercy the same one that created it the first time can create it again somebody said brother Wayne that's Saint John 14 12 don't beloved to the church brother Adam says if you can't identify there you have spiritual amnesia can you be identified there to believe that that is the truth if it hasn't then you're getting spiritual Amnesia you have forgot your Christian balance if you can't identify with Mark 11 and John 14 The Devils threw you off a balance but a True Believer knows that scripture was written for this day it hasn't happened in other days it has not been for other Seasons but this is the age of the son of man when the word is becoming flesh and the flesh is living now in the Church of the Living God listen this is the Holy Ghost Tabernacle in the Church of the Living God you suppose what are you trying to get at I'm trying to say pick up your weapon and fight back a little while you're anointed to fight back you're not anointed to just take whatever the devil throws at you you don't have to sit and take it you don't have to let the devil drag your young people off the hell you've got a sword it's time to use it mother you gotta claiming Victory you can claim them you can bring them back he said preacher what you're talking about I'm talking about getting the Church of the Living God to remember who they are remember what they're here for remember the promises that God has gave us your body is the Tabernacle of the deity of almighty God it's where the devil's powerful let me tell you what brother random said he said the atomic weapon is not the most powerful weapon in the world I got news for Mr Putin the atomic weapon is not the most powerful thing in the world the prophet of God said this the greatest power in the world is not the atom bomb it is a believer in contact with his maker brother there's a power in this church I feel it Rising right now it's a law that activates it it's the law of faith it's the law of faith and whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours the same as when Caleb put his foot on the land when you believe it with your heart it is yours and you can possess it they will take action they will display strength it's talking to you amen they will take action they will display strength there's talking to you listen I'm on I'm I'm closing right here I want I want to say this to you all hell is against this if you thought that you were just going to believe this message and walk easy you're wrong there's Giants in this land and you're asking yourself right now if it's right why are there so many battles because it is right it is right you're going the other direction all the world is moving that way and you're going against the grain that's why it's a battle but you were built for it brother you were built for it brother Brandon said everything is against the spiritual revelation of Christ being here now it's against it it's against it being here now now I know I know it ought to be I know it ought to be easy it you know it ought to be but it ain't because God didn't build it that way he built it as a Battlefield you know uh you know in in the scripture there's an artist there's an oddest scripture over the Book of Judges and you know the Bible said that God left Giants in the land after Joshua died how many ever read that said the Giants were left in the land after Joshua died it said the generations of the children after Joshua died there were people that lived and you know why the Giants were left there it's it's actually says it in Judges chapter 3 it tells you exactly why God left Giants in the land he said to teach them War God intended for them to learn more after Joshua left it did amazing brother man's been gone now 57 57 years he's been gone Christmas Eve 57 years and there's Giants left he said preacher wise they're still Giants because God had to teach you the war young people you got to learn the war you got to learn to fight you've got to learn to pick up your sword and fight back Mom and Dad ain't always going to be there it ain't always going to be that somebody else can do the fighting for you sometimes you've got to just pick your sword up and fight because you've got to learn to war you've got to learn to overcome you've got to learn to be you if y'all got a little youth group here got a little Fellowship I guarantee you somebody's had their feelings hurt because they wasn't invited and the best thing for a pastor to do is not even have a youth group and then you would never have that come on Church y'all know I'm telling you the truth you'd never have to deal with it if you didn't have a youth group but if you're going to have a youth group and I think it's a good thing then you're gonna have some Giants you're gonna have to kill so instead of wondering what's wrong with the youth group know this there's a giant in that that don't want you to have that Fellowship so pick your sword up and quit being a crybaby quit wondering why somebody didn't invite me somebody didn't call me somebody didn't do it it's the devil dying to destroy you pick up your sword and fight back sorry I don't want to slip over in the pastoring gear here but y'all know what I'm talking about if you're going to have church if you're gonna be here if you're going to have fellowship and friends and that's going to come stuff up in this church that's going to come directional differences there's going to come ideas probably not any Doctrine but one's going to think it should be done this way and one's going to think and the best thing is just don't have church there wouldn't be no fighting right nobody would argue nobody would feel but if you're going to have church you're going to have Giants but listen it's the word of God that we can have church and we can live in unity and we can have peace and we can bring joy in life but if we're going to do it we're going to have to destroy the Giants that move in the Church of Fellowship no we're not going to shut the doors we're going to cut the head off of the devil no we're not going to quit having Youth groups we're going to cut the head off of the devil no we're not going to print preaching the word of God we're going to cut their head off of the devil because it's a god-given right to do so [Applause] ah come on Church my goodness y'all's a good crowd preacher what are you talking about let me tell you what I'm talking about fighting ain't just ain't just about preaching the word it ain't just that that ain't all it is don't you ever separate war from worship you can't do it you can't separate war from praise now if God's teaching you how to war he taught them in the Bible how to do it didn't he remember what he did when he taught David how to war David learned it by dancing before the Lord listen David learned to play music and he learned to war the demons with music but David wrote beautiful word he understood as God what about Joshua when he met the captain of the host and he stood in a wall that wouldn't move what happened to him he inquired of the Lord and God told him you walk down the Walls but when it come to the end of it remember they begin to praise God before the walls ever begin to fall and let me tell you this that's the way you wore this devil that's the way you wore the problems that's the way you are sometimes you got to praise God when the law is still standing when the problems are still there when the travels are still there listen amen sometime or another you've got to shout before you see it you got to praise God before you know it's there you say well I'll tell you I ain't got no reason to praise God it's according to what you're looking at if you're looking at the problem no ma'am you can't do it but if you're looking at the promises of God Amen the Bible says you'll overcome it the Bible said we're going to be victorious the Bible said we could have come on church I'm talking to somebody in the Church of the Living God that's going to fight this devil not just by the word but they're going to praise the god of Heaven in doing so you know you're going to if you ever confuse the devil sister you ever confuse the devil hey man I know that devil hates me I confuse him I confuse confusing Devils I depress depression Devils I make nervous Devils nervous I make anxiety Devil's anxiety amen you said how do you do it I'll tell you how I do it just like they've done it in the Bible when a great host come against Jehoshaphat you know where he went he went straight in the temple of God and he began to pray and when you begin to pray God told him the battle is not yours it belongs to the Lord and remember what he was told he said look you go out in this great company but before you go you pick yourself some singers and you pick yourself some praises and you send them out in front of the word and the Bible said I will confuse your enemy amen come on I will put an ambush on your enemy amen you know I'll tell you it's a powerful thing and the Bible records that they went against a great multitude and the only thing they did is worship God in song and the Word was coming behind them the Army was moving in but by the time the Army got there the enemy was already defeated listen I tell you what you can do tonight you can start praising God right now and confuse that devil and make him wonder why is this man worshiping why is this water I'll tell you why we're doing it because that's how we do War we are warring an enemy and we will not be defeated can you stand to your feet with us tonight Hallelujah [Applause] and I should come back sometime and do a whole sermon on how to do War but I'll tell you this you never learned that in the Army brother they never talk to you in the Marine Corps how to do that but in this Army of God the prophet of God said you begin to take the word and you begin to worship god you watch what happens something will take place something will change I wonder if our musicians could come tonight something will take place and I believe tonight friends I believe that this is a season I believe it's your seats I really do I really do believe

me live to see this Christmas [Music] and he said here I stand and he preached a sermon but he didn't seem like no sick man standing in that Pulpit all that adversity through the whole year he wanted to stand and preach that sermon on Christmas day yes do we have that desire you say well I'm not battling cancer well you're battling everything else come right here come into a service and say God I'm I'm coming back next Sunday I'm coming back Wednesday night I'm coming back it's a struggle I tell them brother Wayne that that we're not on a cruise ship right we're on a battleship this is not whining and dining this is not forks and knives them people that are on that boat you know what on a cruise ship happy-go-lucky you on a battleship you got a job to do if you don't do your job everybody else depends on you they're going to die too so you get on that Battleship our brother got on the battleship tonight and he he sent some salvos he sent some he sent some atomic bombs over there he didn't just shoot you know it's courteous to shoot across the bow you know try to get him to stop now I think I think I think he struck him right in the middle of it you know you think about Israel like his brother's dad just said it many many times you know they sent the singers out first they sink the worshipers out first well if you were a if you were a battle heart veteran on the other side though and hear you're getting ready to try to beat on some battle-hardened veteran on the other side and you see the singers coming and you see the trumpet players and you see everybody worshiping and shouting I just about knocked my you know I be like man well that's the way it is with the devil he thinks he's gonna he knows he knows how to fight yes devil knows how to fight good adversary brother Brown said but we've got more than he does we've got a power behind us that's Eternal his is temporary ours is eternal amen you love the Lord give our brother another good hand and we appreciate we we always always um when we bring a minister in we pray about it you know we had prayer service a few weeks ago to pray that this meeting went well and then you know he just comes in here and and we don't get to talk much and and my for all of y'all that's been been sitting listening to me for a year you know what we've been preaching on we've been preaching on the son of man for 77 sermons we've been on the son of man and now we've been on we've been we've been going up Caleb's Mountain amen yeah we're down at the bottom but we're going up Caleb's Mountain give me my Mountain that's my Mountain that's my Mountain God give me that mountain at 85 years old you know what he didn't look at circumstances and that's what we got to quit doing looking at circumstances well my children this my you know my children not serving the lord well why are you looking at circumstances If Abraham would have looked at if he'd went to the clinic come on somebody if he went to the clinic they just said come on dude you're 99. ain't it happening he didn't go to a clinic he took that promise of God and he said I'm gonna have a baby many times before you've got to literally see your children sitting on the front row they may be out in the world they may be doing whatever they're doing but you gotta literally I mean see them sitting there because that's what Abraham did Abraham literally saw that baby amen right he knew he couldn't do anything about him he tried like we do we try to get in and you know Lord save my kids but no not that much now lay it on them Abraham waited until he's not there he in other words he just said Lord I can't do it anymore you're gonna have to do it for me and that's where he wants me and you to be and I think our brother brought her tonight where it's got to be God that's doing it not man but it's God in men like as we've been preaching how many times have we read the sermon I mean read the the opening open the scripture you ought to be able to know it by heart John 1 1. in the beginning was the word words with God and Word was God and the Word was made flesh right that's not Jesus all no that's me and you the word was made flesh brother Brown said the flesh becoming word the word becoming flesh I believe that right we might have all of our differences and come from different places and have different DNA in our flesh but in our soul if you're born again tonight you have the DNA of God you are God you're not you're not a second person you are God made manifest in another form that mask was changed how many times did we not preach on that a couple of times ago the mass was changed and now he's in Pride for him that's right he showed that in the book in The Book of Revelations right from the get-go I'm Gonna Be in My bride right and this is what's going to happen so God bless you we love you with the love of the Lord I want to before we leave brother Daniel and and brother Dave and then we're going
