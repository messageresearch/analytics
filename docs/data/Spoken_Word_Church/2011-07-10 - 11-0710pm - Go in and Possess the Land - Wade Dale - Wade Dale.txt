family of God and we are not divided Satan wants us to be but we're not divided like we were talking this yesterday in the Bible study we we don't hate the people but sometimes we hate what they do but you hate the devil cuz he's the one that made them do it but you know I was telling them this morning in the Bible study I read in Sunday school class excuse me a second and I told him I said the the most powerful scripture in the world is resist the devil yeah and he'll flee from you cuz he cannot go against your will if you don't want him cast him out for a way of announcements let me go

possess the land let's pray before we get started dear heavenly father we pray Lord that you would come Among Us in a special way today Lord that you would Lord just take care of of your word it's already been blessed it's already been spoken it's already been been written Lord but now let's Lord let's see it made manifest bring it Lord and and bring it to our hearts and open our eyes of understanding and our ears Lord that we may here Lord we're a special group in a special time a special place and we have a special message Lord we hear many times Lord that uh people of of the Jewish faith Lord that they they're arrogant people but Lord with the Holy Spirit it makes it different it makes Lord that that we didn't choose oursel you chose us Lord you you're the one that made us Lord you're the one that made us a royal priesthood a chosen Nation all those things that you've done for us Lord has been by your will and by your word and father as we have accepted that Lord that makes us part of that economy and being a part of that economy of God Lord You've give us promises you've give us the ability to understand like no one on the face of the Earth has been able to understand your word Lord You Have you have down through time you have shown a piece of yourself through prophets through Lord through judges and through Kings and the ways lord of the people but father in this end time you wanted this group of people standing right here you showed it all in the scripture Lord that that this is the end time this is the time that we are supposed to go and possess what you've already give us father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes Lord the things that we do wrong Lord just take them away from us Lord put them in that sea of forgetfulness Lord and it's like brother Keith said put the no fishing sign out so no one can go fishing for them Father we pray that you just bless each one give us our daily bread Bless the people that are here you said you sent your word and heal them Father if anyone be sick among us today in the building or out other places Lord that you would just be Lord be that one that that great physician that heals Lord all of our diseases father just give us Lord strength keep us may the words that are spoken be your words and not ours and Lord the hearer may be quickened to what you're saying father just bless us take care of us we Praise Your Great Name the great name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Deuteronomy 1 these are the words which Moses spake unto all Israel let's just go with verse one on this side Jordan now this is where Moses is talking to him on this side Jordan this side of the Jordan all right in the wilderness in the plain over against the Red Sea between pan and toal and la and Lebon and herzo and diad the there are 11 days journey from Horeb by the way of Mount SE unto kades barnea and it came to pass in the 40th year on the 11th month on the first day of the month that Moses spake to the children of Israel according to all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them after he had slain Zion the king of the amorites which dwelt in hbon and OG the king of Bashan which dwelt at asth in Ed on this side Jordan in the land of Moab began Moses to declare this law on this side Jordan on this side right all right in the land of Moab remember the moabit people he was in the land of Moab began Moses to declare this law saying the Lord Our God spake to us in Horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this Mount turn ye and take your journey and go to the Mount of the amorites and to all the places now there unto in the plains the hills the veils the South by the seaside to the land of the Canaanites and Lebanon and to the Great River the river Euphrates behold I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them you may be seated and the Lord his Blessing to the reading of the word but he told him he said go you have dwelt long enough go in go in and possess amen all right God had given them that land when he promised it to Abraham correct he told Abraham anywhere the soul of your feet go that's where you're going to possess the people are going to possess that land cuz they gave it to Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them all right and I've said many times before and I was saying this morning in the Sunday school class let's be warned of one thing you and I must go and possess a land but it's not a land like they did in the in the um ages we know that's the type of the Holy Ghost correct right the promised land is the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you and I even being in the land being in that part of the land we have a a higher calling amen right not just to go in and possess the land what did Joshua do he didn't just go in and possess the land but he positionally placed each person in the land right had to fight for everything every inch of ground but God gave him that land well you and I have a land it's a land that's not been given to anyone else and it's a land that where you and I must possess it but we're not going to die and give give it to another generation okay we're not giving it to another church age I was telling them this morning if you ever realize them we're going to read in the Book of Joshua chapter 24 there was seven ites that Joshua had to deal with in that land we'll read them hites Hittites jebusites pites there was seven it's kind of strange there was seven that that Joshua had to deal with in the land in the land not going to the land he didn't have to find his way gave him everything and they had to get through Jordan and they had to get into the land and then the fighting began right I don't understand why people can't realize that that I didn't have a fight until I got in Promised Land you didn't have a fight did you fight when you were going to do things that and all things just flowed right out of your mouth you just grabbed what you wanted to you lusted after the things you wanted to Lust For and it didn't bother you one bit but see now that we are in a battle now that we have crossed Jordan and possessed the promised land that's when all those IES come out right that's when all those places that are that that we need to keep covered right we need to keep them cover because God said I will not you will not lose one man if you'll do what I tell you to do right right and when they didn't do what he told him to do they started losing men well Joshua real quick knew there was a problem he knew God had promised said hey you do this you do this and guess what's going to happen you'll not lose one man exactly not one man not one man amen in a war a battle that's unheard of cuz there was like 25,000 went out to battle the first time well in 25,000 you send 25,000 troops out somebody's going to die but God promised he said not one of you will die what a great thing we'll keep that in mind because we may use that in just a little while because you know what the people that are going to take a body change is going to have to take that same Revelation that same revelation of the body change is that you will not die exactly I don't care how many battles you fight I don't care how many wars as long as you do what you're supposed to do you will not die right cuz that's what he told him he said you'll not lose one man and then we know what happened with uh with a but we're not going into that right now now if you want to well go aad and turn to the book of numbers and we'll start in just a second but I want to excuse me tell you the reason that I asked that if I could do this tonight this afternoon was number one I I begin to think about this and I'm I was thinking about you know the promised land and I don't want when I get started with this I don't want anybody to think one thing's for sure that there's going to be some new somebody you know the what Keith said was you know the old Fighters died and this you know Hey listen they were lost eternally so let's don't talk about them exactly because you know what the Lord brought to my attention was when they crossed over in the Promised Land they were 20 and Below do you know when you cross over in the promised land that's what you are I don't care if you're 70 I don't care if you're 40 I don't care if you're 20 right brother Brown said we'd be 18 to 20 years old yeah right so anything 20 years old and Below that's that's going in the promised land so don't think that that I'm trying to say well those old Fighters you know brother Brown said those old Fighters but remember one thing they weren't born again right we got people that are sitting here that's been Fighters for a long time and they fult the faith and fult the gospel they're not the ones that's dying off this is a new generation when you're born again in this hour it's a new genation you've been reged I don't care if you're 70 40 20 or or 12 all right so don't think I'm talking about old people cuz you're more young than the than the younger people you're heading towards your youth we got this thing all backwards that's why I believe who was it said that we're supposed to cry at a birth and Rejoice at a funeral we do right the opposite we we cry at a funeral and rejoice when the baby's born we're not supposed to do that because we're getting closer but see what's going to happen is we got to change this guy right here we got to change this type of thinking that we've had uh one time I got you know he was a I think it was Zig Ziggler he said it's that stinking thinking that we've got that's what it is it's just when we get our own thoughts and our own ideas into something like we were talking about last night we get our own thoughts ideas into this and it becomes hatred malice emulation Strife what is Strife two people with two different ideas right it's not bad for me and brother dick to see different things different ways but see then if you start saying well brother Dick's wrong because or brother Wade's wrong because that's when you get into all those things of works of the flesh that we've been talking about in the the Sunday school I mean in the bible study which is very good because we do all have works of the flesh right we do all have Envy we do all have Strife we do all all those things but like we were saying before in James it says when lust is conceived brings forth Sin Sin when it's finished brings forth death right all right so if you let it keep going because the conception does what it plants the seed see it's not bad to have Envy it's not bad for me to be envious that somebody's driving a brand new car or we're suan Susan's driving my pickup truck so I'm envious of that but see I don't let it become so envious that I think all of her you know or think bad of her I told her the other day I said you know the Bible says that to not have ought against your brother but it didn't say nothing about your sister but that's just you're not supposed to do that I'm just telling you for a point don't don't do that but see there's things that we do as humans though in life that we shouldn't do like I just said resist the devil and he'll flee from you because we make these things and we roll them around in our brain and 99% of the time it's like the old saying is if brother Dick's talking to Sister Gail and she looks over at me and we're in a crowd but she looks over at me I immediately go well they're talking about me well no listen they got 100% more problems with their s than they got with me all right just for an example I guess I did that one time and somebody said me and my wife had a fight coming to church you didn't know that I said no I didn't know that I said but the Lord must have knew it he was there I wasn't but listen to get started the reason I was looking at this and seeing and I was going to give you a little experience that I had in Oklahoma is that I was ministering there the last time and and you know I don't I'm not what you say a very spiritual kind of guy you know but there are sometimes when God will drop down and say something to you believe and you listen amen cuz remember the first time remember they remember June and I had went on a cruise and we had went um to Seattle and we were were getting ready to fly back home and the night before you know I told you some of the story but the Lord just well I didn't know it was the Lord then I it's just an impression that you get that that the engine's going to catch on fire of the plane right just as plain as if dick said just what he said right just something just came and I didn't say nothing to June cuz I didn't want to worri but it put you in a position of desperation right to begin praying in Earnest cuz you don't want to get up in the sky and airplane and the engine catch on fire but that became so real to me that I believed that that's what was going to happen so I prayed and you know for those of you that don't know the story make a long story short we get on the the Jet and we're sitting there you know we're everybody's already loaded on the plane we're getting ready to leave and I thought well Lord you got to do something now cuz I want him to find it now I don't want him to find it up there right all right so I one but about 10 minutes before we were getting ready to take off I look out and look out and I see all these people come running toward the wing of the plane well there was a huge gas leak in that engine of that plane and if they would have fired that engine up it would have caught on fire so so they got us off the plane well thank God for that God didn't tell me he was going to do that he just said that the engine was going to catch on fire he wanted me to pray all right well then it happened just the other day we were coming back from uh Oklahoma and and I was tell I'll tell you the experience of that in a minute but we were coming back from Oklahoma the night before June thought I was mad at her cuz usually when when I get to meditate and I don't say anything and uh same voice just come straight down and said there's going to be a flat tire but it's just something it's it's an impression it's not something that you know just there's going to be a flat tire well she didn't know it but every time we stopped cuz it's 2 and 1/2 hours from Bartlesville to witch car to get on the airplane and we were running kind of late anyway so I'd go around I was kicking the tires on every time we stopped get gas I was going around kicking I said Lord there going to be cuz it was that same impression and so I knew it was going to happen right well see I prayed in Earnest but when I got when we got ready to to go everything was fine we flew back into Atlanta and flew in and we get a phone call and it's Hannah she said I've had a flat tire on the interstate right but it wasn't so flat actually a policeman drove by and pointed down to a tire the front tire was almost flat so she had to pull off on the side of the road which she was running probably 60 or 70 M an hour and so she was warned of that or it would have burst so see here you go praying in Earnest and you to start praying well see don't things like that happen well the other day I had an experience in Oklahoma that I had finished ministering and and you know the the Lord was really come down in in prayer with the people and it was just the same group of people same normal group as it is but I'm getting to a story here but when I finished and brother claw took over in the Pulpit I just felt like just like you know you you when you're preaching you get kind of fired up you know you get a little bit you like Brother Dean said you know he was feeling bad until he got the pull pad and you do that you there's an anointing comes on you and it doesn't matter if you have a headache or whatever anything happens when you're up here and you feel the anointing of the people which is you pulling on the gift then you feel you feel you know you feel good right well baby when I see down well I didn't sit down I I went over and stood like I usually do and it was just like somebody had just took a a valve and just pulled all the energy out of my body if you've never had that happen before you're in for a treat amen but what happens is it's the virtue right it's strength just and I just I fell out I sat down and CLA looked over and he he didn't say anything but you know he then he started worshiping the people started worshiping and we had a real good time and I told him afterwards I said man I said I couldn't stand up that's right I said I couldn't stand up and I told them while they was there you know uh they got finished singing and I said can I say something I said whatever you need at this time you pray for it right now cuz God's here doing something I don't know what he's doing I mean he he don't have to write down on a tablet and tell you what he's going to do you know why cuz it's child training he's training me and you to when he speaks you know it's him amen and you better start doing something about it I mean he could told me he said well you're not going to have a tire flat your daughter is no he didn't he wanted me to pray and I was praying the whole time cuz you said I thought you were mad at me cuz by the time we flew into Atlanta I had forgot about the tire and then she's on the phone she said Hannah just had a flat and I just turned around and started crying I said God I said I know what it was for then I said it was you want me to pray because you knew that tiwer was going to go flat I didn't same way with the airplan but during that time I thought in myself that that the people there were of course we you know we're real close to each other and almost like we are here uh just a family but someone was pulling strength out of out of you know not me as a person but but what was being said what was being ministered and you know and Claude even even um said that that was the best he had heard in a long time you know of of what we've been ministering out there and it was more of a for the people amen and I come back and and I thought I thought Lord I need to do something because I'm stuck we all get in those places you know that where you just sitting there spinning your wheels we get stuck in a place and and you know just to give you a little bit of background uh the work that I had done was was a very stressful job it was a it was a job where you had to do a lot of you had to lie just be let me just be honest you were told to do things that were dishonest that you were not supposed to do and being put in a job as a as a plant manager there's a lot of stress and a lot of hours involved and I had forgot about you guys I had forgot about God really because that was on my mind 24 hours a day 7 days a week it was something that I thought about continually and that was job this job that job this job that so I was sit and praying you know a several weeks ago and you know you sometimes you you just have to do what God says just like on those things about praying well that same voice that that had come the other two times come a third time and said we'll call your brother they call your brother cuz I've been praying I said Lord I need out of this because I'm dying spiritually and I don't want to die spiritually I don't mind work but when you get that thing work stuck in your head let me tell you something people physical stress won't kill you mental stress will kill you you will not get away from mental physical stress you can just take a day off for Saturday stay in bed till 8:30 9:00 and you're you know you're rejuvenated you you just have to you know you just have to pace yourself but mental stress will kill you right cuz you can't get rid of it there's no way of working it off right all right and so all that came about and I was sitting there thinking on what to do something to do and and praying about it and and that same voice came and said we'll call your brother see what he's got so anyway make a long story short I'm working for him now and and the stress level went from 100 to zero Bless but I I went and talked to Dad about it and you know I had been more I had been wanting to do more with with with you yeah and that's what the impression came to me from Oklahoma was that the people was drawing strength from from what I had to say from a gift that that God give me that that I've used in the wrong way for many years that I want to use in the right way and I haven't been doing it in the past several years because of that part of the work that I was doing but I thought Lord I want to do something more to help you yeah because we all need help and you know when Keith come last weekend and he started talking about the family I thought well God that's a there was a couple other things that I prayed about that was a confirmation that you know sometimes we we want to we want to be just like step out on faith and boy have that big strong faith but you like to have a little bit of a little no every once in a while that God is with you and and and we got that and in in what we're doing but I want to I want to do more with with you as a church because you know what Joshua and Caleb this is what all came to me Joshua and Caleb that 20y old group and Below they were raised under more I believe this now the Bible didn't say this but this is just what I believe they were raised under that Joshua and Caleb mentality right don't you think that they were under that Joshua and Caleb mentality but what they was when they got there to CTI barnea some of them weren't even born cuz it was 40 years in the wilderness right some of them were 20 and below so they were they were born in the way that's what I was saying about the way yeah we get in the way a lot of times right that's what happened to those people over there they got in the way those two million people got in the way of Joshua and Caleb because Joshua and Caleb said we're more than able to take that ramp amen that's right and I believe if they let Joshua and Caleb go brother de they would have went and took the land cuz God had done said he said they'll not nobody stand in front of you glory nobody nobody where's Satan in this nobody exactly nobody will stand in front of you nobody will stand in front of us if we'll just believe so I got to think about Joshua and Caleb and that men mentality that they had been brought up under they didn't see the signs yeah they didn't see the Wonders but now they did eat the Mana amen cuz the Mana didn't cease till they got in the promised land exactly right so they ate the Mana right they saw that their clothes grew with them amen but Joshua and Caleb I believe was sitting there every day we going to take this place we're going to a new land we're going to possess this land we're going to go to a spot that you've never seen before but believe me we've seen it right Joshua is the type of the Holy Ghost and Caleb's the type of the end time believer right amen well that's those those little 20 and Below must have fit in that Caleb Spot somewhere right cuz Joshua and Caleb was the one that was telling them even Moses was there right and we'll read it in just a minute that Joshua and Caleb lived with that group of people amen that's right I believe Brother D I believe they live with that group of people and train them cuz you know what the Lord told Joshua said as I was with Moses now what did Moses do Moses trained Joshua Joshua was there the whole time right exactly Joshua was right there with Moses the whole time amen so even though Moses went off the scene Moses was standing there in Joshua absolutely okay then now what is Joshua going to do he's got to take that what he's got and give it to this new generation right that's coming up if we've been here 40 years then we need to do something about getting into this new genation right so believe me or not like me or not you're stuck with me I told that I was going to start doing more with each one of you if you have any problems you can come talk to me he's still the pastor don't ever forget that I'm not taking nobody's place but I do want to help right I do want to help okay any any of you we're going to maybe go visit and do things Jun and I be able to visit more maybe with you and do some more things with you and I want to go after the ones that are not in here yeah the Lord I believe Joshua and Caleb went after that group of 20 and below and they focused on that group of people amen and they went after them and you know what none of the old ones made it but the Bible says all that were 20 and under went in that Promised Land all of them all of our people we got we got empty seats where brother Robbie and sister Ruth all your children I want to have I want to I I I don't need your blessing to go talk to them but I would like to have some support amen as I do go talk to them okay um Richard H some of those others some of those people that are out there just floundering around in a world right uh I got a good chance to talk with Jeff's with me and and and Amy they're not in church all the time I want to be able to talk to them some more cuz Jeffrey will be with me most of the time while we're working and had a good chance to talk to brother Timothy and and even Lisa's brother was interested in some he heard an hour sermon he's going to have to sit in the car with me so he listened to everything I said you know I used him for an example cuz he was chewing Tob Backa and I used to do that so I kind of used him as an example and and Timbo was sitting in the back you know so you got a captive audience right they can't they're not going to get out 70 mph in M Atlanta so yeah but I want to be more involved because I want it's like I was saying in Oklahoma there was some there was some things and and I know I got a gift I got a gift to yaking but also that that the Lord has given me an ability to teach where I can break things down and and you say well well you're boasting no I'm like I was praying right in Israel just like gersan Solomon and them said said I can't help it in what God made me but I'm going to take what God made me and I'm going to use it now that's what the Jews they may be arrogant cuz they not born again I don't want to be arrogant cuz I believe I'm a born again Christian it's not going to make me arrogant right but I do know that God give us a gift amen and he told us that if we get in our position ain't that what we're waiting on somebody to stand up and say hey I'm I'm a deacon I know I'm an elder I know I have the gift of wisdom I know I have the gift of faith I know I have these other gifts all the way down all nine spiritual gifts you got to realize that's what you're looking at amen you got to realize that I told him I going to do this hey but everybody I'm telling you everybody him included I want us all to make it amen and I'm going to do everything I can right to see that we do make it cuz Joshua and what Caleb tell him he said give me my Mountain amen he said I am no more I am no more weak than when me and Moses talked about this 40 years ago I am no more weak today than I was then that was 40 years he was 80 years old man but you know what he got he got the mountain exactly he got the possession that God had given that's what I want to say go in and possess the land that's right now look let me read you something turn to turn to numbers 14 verse 29 and I hope I'm all right with this I am not wanting to get in your face and make you a Christian right that don't work I don't want to build church members that's right I do not want to fill this church up with people right amen I want to fill this church up with Christian amen and the ones of you that's been here for a while I want you to be a Christian that's what I was telling I was telling Timbo I said brother Tim I said he said well I don't know if I'm born again or not I said you know what I said sometimes I feel the same way but they somewhere you got to put a state down and say God like that brother said you going to find a bag of bones right here until you do something for me I'm going to stay right here this is where I'm going to put a state down and he made a good statement he said you know he said I'm going work in progress I said brother Tim we're all to work in progress I said but I want to see us to where this is this is what I want to see and I don't like I said I want to get in your face but I don't want to see when we start take communion this afternoon that half of you walk out that back door or half of you take communion and don't do the foot washing yeah come on people that's right the Bible didn't say do half of it right the Bible said do all of it so either do it all or don't do any of it if you're still smoking drinking running around wearing earrings and all this junk don't take communion today cuz you're not worthy we have open communion for anybody that wants it right but the Bible said that you are condemning your own body amen you will die right remember even when they brought the ark back they brought it back in a wrong way cuz it was on a cart right but what happened a good man that had good intentions come on now he had good intentions he didn't want that Ark to hit the ground but when he touched that Ark he was not worthy to touch that Ark and what did he do God killed him right so we got good intentions but like old saying is the road to Hell's paid with good intentions we got to be Christians we got to be born again Believers cuz when Joshua went in that land he didn't take halfway Believers with him right cuz we're going to find out something happened that they must have believe Joshua so much till he let them circumcise every one of them at 20 years old that's right he circumcised them they didn't do it theirself and the doctor didn't do it Joshua did it then they went in took the land let's read verse 29 your carcass shall fall in this Wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upward which have murmured against me doubtless you shall not come into the land concerning which I swear to make you dwell therein save Caleb the son of jeffan and Joshua the son of none but your little ones and I wrote in my Bible that's me which you said should be a prey them will I bring in and they shall know the land which you have despised right but as for you your carcass they shall fall in this Wilderness and your children shall wander in the wilderness 40 years and bear your boredom until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness we not read on because don't worry about that I don't think like I said everybody said boy you start talking about a new generation coming up then you got old people you know you got dad and you got dick you got all brother collie and all these gray-headed people brother how you think boy they're just going to rot in the will no when you become born again you become a 20-y old just like that exactly exactly when you become born again you're 20 years old that's like dad's been preaching you're redeemed sitting in Heavenly places that soul is is 20 years old exactly right ain't that what the prophet said amen so don't talk about these old people well they're got all die off well they might but you know what they're closer to being young than we are amen right but we're all the same age Glory when God looks at us so when Joshua looked at that group of people he saw that 20 and Below he said hey this is the group I've been looking for right here amen cuz remember the Bible says Josh that God raised up a new generation that didn't know all that old junk that had been going on all that old two Lords and seven Thunders and all that stuff that's what I'm telling you people you and I in this building today better realize one thing we're either going to go in or we're going to die like those people did cuz we know too much we've got too much going on here that we can't say well we're ignorant of these things we're not ignorant we're either with the Joshua and Caleb group or we're with that group that Jesus said they're all dead cuz you and I don't have there's not a gray area exactly you're not almost pregnant no you're either pregnated or you're not pregnated and like I told him this morning and they are and they are fruits to show that each one that's the way we should be all right but I want to do one thing brother R said I didn't come to build a church he said I come to build individual right I want us all to grow as individuals right cuz some are not going to be you can't say well now brother Gary you got to be no you ain't got to be it's like brother Keith said and I really enjoyed what he said he said now I was telling him in Sunday school not doing away with the fivefold ministry we know that the only way to get perfected is by can everybody say Amen we don't take the Bible away but there is a time where that need the Bible says no man need teach you why because what you hear from here right that inside teacher is going to tell you yes it's right or no it's or no it's wrong all right so it's between you and God you are the ones that you when this thing when this thing disperses and we can't meet like this anymore guess who it's going to be it's going to be you and God it's going to be you and God but you know what it's going to be what you built on while you were here and I'm not saying here as far as here this this physical but here in this message right that's what's going to take you in cuz Joshua and K I don't think they sat down individually maybe with each one but they took him as a group and said look here's the promised land right right it's a land flowing with milk and honey we saw it with our eyes we'll read it in just a minute Joshua said you hadn't been this way before so kind of stand back a little bit but who did he send first the priest he sent the priest first amen then when the priest got in Jordan roll back the waters then the people walked away all right but now the priest had not physically been there before but they must knew something they must have caught the vision of a message that Joshua and Caleb preached sometimes I think what we do is we take Joshua and Caleb and say well they were Mighty people but they were just men my it's an example for your whole journey it's an example for everything plus by the time we get in the promised land we still got all these IES that we got to fight the war didn't start till last till they Cross Jordan exactly all right but but God say if you'll do all these things right no man will stand in front of you all right now let's turn to Joshua 1 cuz that's when they really started to focus in on the journey everybody all right say Amen am I want to help you people I've always wanted to help people right and I want to help you I don't want to ever hurt you and I know I've hurt hurt feelings Maybe by sometimes by the things I say but just God help me to clam it shut all right cuz I want to help you Gina I want to help you all I do sometimes maybe in in U joking like we were talking about last night you know brother brand said you shouldn't joke well he wasn't talking about cuz they said he told jokes all the time but if you if you if a joke was if a joke between two people hurts a third person that's not a joke that's right you understand what I'm saying you joke around make somebody feel lower right you're not helping anything so best thing to do just shut up you know best thing to do just be quiet all right so in Joshua 1 we see this man do we believe that Joshua now Joshua the man is physically dead now right now right but if he types the Holy Spirit then he's still alive amen amen and whatever we need to go into this land the Holy Ghost has already been there and he's trying to get us to go there right all right and then what he's going to do though people we can't stop there we we we say so much about getting into the land but when we get in that land there still work to do amen but there is a promise and I want to read you the promise in just a little while but in Joshua 1 now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses is Minister yeah Joshua was Moses's minister right Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people un the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that I have given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness un this Lebanon even into the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of th thy life let that sink in as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage For unto this people now look listen to this unto this people what's happened the people he's talking about right now all those other million and something are dead the old people the old ones that he was talking about you know that's going to die they're gone and this right here they're gone he's talking to that one group of people that raised up under his ministry all right be strong and of good courage unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance this land which I swear unto their fathers to give unto thee unto them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded theee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest all right let's go to verse n have not I commanded thee be strong and of good courage he's told him this three times Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest if you're born again that's exactly what happened whether soever thou goest God is with you Glory then Jesus commanded the off then Jesus well same thing then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you victuals for within 3 days you shall pass over this Jordan what are we in now we're in our our 2,000 years is gone we're in our third day right you shall pass over this Jordan now what is Jordan type of death right if you're going to type everything you might as well go and type Jordan to go in to possess the L which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it and to the reubenites and gadites to half the tribe of Manasseh spake Joshua saying remember the words of Moses now we know that was a type of the church ages with Luther and Wesley and a half tribe of Pentecost you can read that in the message save time but there was two tribes and a half that stayed on this side and the they went over though see that's where people they say well Luther and Wesley didn't have the Holy Ghost cuz they didn't go over into the promised land read your Bible right they went over in the promised land helped them fight and then come back out and got their land all right because remember Luther and Wesley couldn't get all the way out of their denominational ideas everybody understand that amen the two tribes and the half tribe they tped Luther and Wesley went over the land and helped them fight cuz this what Joshua said I want you to go over there and help them fight but when we possess that land you can go back and get your land on this side this side Jordan all right cuz they they had the new birth for their age but they didn't couldn't get all the way out they couldn't they couldn't go into that see this promised land is more than we just say well it's the Ty of the new birth it is the type of New Birth but it's the type of the end time believer amen Caleb was the type of the end time believer not the first age believer the second a the brother said the end time believer so Caleb is you and I the end time believer all right and these two tribes in a half they went over to fight and then they come back all right then we'll take skip chapter 2 we know that's Rahab but go to chapter 3 and then we'll finish right here you love the Lord I love him now you say well you love him more than now I love him more than ever cuz you know what he's sent me somewhere he give me something to do amen he ought to give all of you something to do I want all of you you know I I was thinking I'm here I go but I sat back there the other day and watching some of you and and if some of you would have moved you'' have crack when brother Keith was preaching and you don't have to be emotion emotional but an a man every once in a while will help and you know going to the Land of Nod that's okay but you know what if it was a ball game on you wouldn't be asleep amen maybe we ought just have a cheering section in the back you know just start cheering but listen people this is worth more than anything if you can't sleep if you sleep in church you ought to go to bed Saturday night I'd take n Quil a gallon of it and I'd sleep very good till about 8:00 and I'd get up and come to church I'm sorry but listen we pray for the sick the land of not is not a good place to be cuz I told him one time before and I'll find that quote I just can't get it all right in the computer but brother brandham said you miss service cuz brother Tim asked me I was talking about Abraham you know if Abraham had not been where he was at he would have missed meaz right well brother Brown said if you miss a church service or you miss something he's talking about something he should you me he said God that may be the very day that God is passing by to give you a blessing and should you missed it amen you missed it because you weren't in you were in the bus station looking for the train right right now I didn't say that he did so don't get mad at me and get mad at the prophet right cuz that's what he said and that's what you and I because Listen People when these people got in this land the problem they had was they wanted other people's stuff stay in your land stay if God give you this part right here get in it and stay in it that's what you know brother Jim pink and I he really enjoyed and you know I'm not this is not my soap opera not my soap box but you know brother Jim said I like a man that knows I'm a teacher I I'm I'm just I just like to teach and I know that's my gift so I'm not going to try to do something else I'm not going to try to be an evangelist brother juul for is the best evangelist on the field today but he's not a pastor and you know what he knows knows that amen there's a lot of people offered him a lot of money you know he and I are are very very very good friends and we talk about every week and he's been offered you wouldn't believe the money he's been offered to take to church you won't do it he said I'm an evangelist this is the gift that God give me is to be an evangelist I have no other gift but to be an evangelist I I honor that man for that more than anything amen cuz we got evangelists that are pastors and pastors that evangelist and they're just swapping get in whatever gift you got if your gift is just praying for me if your gift is just praying for brother Dale that's a gift exactly that's a gift amen if you got a gift to touch God I don't care who you are 5 years old or 105 years old if you got a gift to touch God I want you praying for me amen I ain't no big eyes and little you in this thing none none chapter 3 and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they were moved from sham and came to Jordan and he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over now remember brother Dale talked about this morning if you read on down through the book of Romans we talk about a place that we wait for something yeah all right these people come to a place and that was that was the reason that they possessed the land they went by what God told them Joshua told them to do right now see the problem is here's here's the here's here's the people in the message they come up to Jordan and he Joshua is their leader and they come up and they don't want to Lodge they want to go over now yeah let's go now let's go do something you remember when the children of Israel said said you know let Moses speak and all that remember at the mountain all this how all this came about and then the very next day or two they said oh we can go we'll go possess it now remember what they done they went out of the will of God they went up on that mountain and the amorites killed them a bunch of them and they had to come back down why because God didn't tell them to go up at then he told them to go 2 days before and they didn't want to go right same way with you and I there's a time and a place for all things and we must be able to do just like this they lodged there before they passed over they had to wait till the right time to go over Jordan they didn't you know like I said I just see people today they say well they see the Jordan and they see the promised land well they just you know mule blinders and just take out that's why you have so many false doctrines that's why you have so many ideas that's why you have so many divisions it's because people want to go out ahead of the program even the prophet of God said that he said you see these scrap heaps of ministers laying on the side of the road tried to go out ahead of somebody and they fell off right same way with you and I and it came to pass after 3 days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant now what was in that Ark of the Covenant the two tables of stone brother B said The Headstone so we're not talking about some just little we're not talking about this baby form being born again now we're talking about The Headstone being with us we're talking about the Ark of the Covenant the two tables of stone fit inside that Ark and they had possession of that they had possession of that Ark so do you and I right and it came to pass after three days officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it see that's what happened they were supposed to Bear it the preachers were supposed to Bear the word not an ox cart or anything else cuz that's what got them in trouble with David that thing got ready to fall off if they if the priest would have been carrying it they would not have a problem all right then you shall remove from your place and go after it so the ministry goes before right that's what it's saying right the priests are going to Bear the ark they're going to go before with the word of God cuz they're first partakers right yet there shall be a space between you and it right about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way here to for right and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you and Joshua spake un the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant and pass it over before the people in other words they put it in front of the people first that's what we're doing right now right right that's what we're doing right now the Ark of the Covenant is with us and we're passing it before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify the in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with you and thou shalt command the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant now who is this Joshua type of the Holy Ghost he's commanding the priest to do something amen you say well I'm not going to take orders from nobody well well you just lost the gift that God gave you right cuz God give you a gift and he tells you to do something you need to do it amen cuz Thou shalt command the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan you shall stand still in Jordan we waited a few minutes ago now we're standing still Joshua had to get all the people in order God don't like to confusion God's not going to have confusion God is not in confusion all right same way with this watch this and I can just picture this in my mind you got you got thousands of people and all these different tribes you got the Levites you got the priests you got but watch how this thing all just comes in order cuz they're going to they got to cross through one certain section of Jordan they don't cross through 14 different sections or 14 different doctrines they go one way right behind that word of God all right and Joshua said un the children of Israel come hither and hear the word of the Lord your God and Joshua said hereby ye shall know that the Living God is among you he realized God was among those people and that he will without fail drive out from you the Canaanites one Hittites two hivites three pites four gesit five amorites 6 and the jebusites Seven there were seven IES that had to go in that land that were living there living there and Joshua and his army Had to Kill Them All Out behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth passeth over before you into Jordan now therefore take you 12 men out of the tribe of Israel out of every tribe of man and it shall come to pass as soon as the soul of you feet of the priest that bear the ark the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heat yeah what are we trying to in this end time what are we trying to preach you to right a body change amen everybody was scared of that Jordan River cuz remember when they passed over it was out of its Bank it wasn't in just a little trickle season cuz in verse 15 it says for Jordan overflowed all his Banks all the time of harvest and that's when they crossed over so the Jordan was not some little bitty Creek it was some big wide Place amen the people were feared but verse 14 and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan and the priest bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as they that bear the ark were come un Jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water what the Bible say blessed are the feet right of them that carry the gospel the good news you go over in the Old and New Testament all right and as they that bear the ark were come to Jordan and the feet of the priest that bear the ark were dipped into the brim of the the water for Jordan overflowed all its banks all the time of the Harvest that the waters which came down from above stood and Rose up upon a heat very far from the city Adam that is beside zaratan and those that came down toward the Sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against Jericho right and the priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm amen they weren't on Shaky Ground they weren't on ship ing sand listen to the I try to take the words of this Bible and make them come alive amen they stood firm on dry ground right in the midst of Jordan and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground unto all the people were past I can just see them walk right past those priests right and knowing that they were the ones that were keeping that death off of them Glory that's why you should believe in the ministry that you have right down for from the small Sunday school teachers all the way up to the pastor if you don't you need to go somewhere else and find you one and I'm not being mean I want you to find somebody that feeds your soul that's not going to be to feed your personality that's right thank you that'll feed your soul amen cuz sometimes you so in your personality a little bit different but now look verse three chapter 4 let's finish right here and command ye them saying take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan out of the place where the priest feat stood firm 12 Stones and shall carry them over with you and leave them on the lodging place where you shall Lodge this night the verse six that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean you by these Stones then you shall say to them that the Waters of Jordan were cut off before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord when it passed over Jordan the Waters of the Jordan were cut off and these Stones shall be a for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever now what is the stone Revelation this Revelation is going to be here that Joshua and Caleb took a group of people and went across this Jordan and didn't see death right right see that's what you and I have to believe now verse 10 for the priest which bear the ark stood in the midst of Jordan until everything until everything that's what got me I I don't want to go out of here until everything and I want to say thing every person that's not born again in this building is born again at least born again I want you born again who was that brother there was one back like irenius or Martin or one of them he wasn't satisfied until every person in his church was filled with the Holy Ghost That should be all of our goal is that everybody and you talking about doing away with problems no no no no no no I just want to make sure I see you on the other side amen if you go by the grave if you you know if something happen you go to another church whatever but I want to see you saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost all right and I want you to be in service for God I don't want you they didn't just go over in the promised land and sit under a palm tree right that's right that's right it wasn't a picnic it was a battle they didn't go to Jordan on vacation you didn't hear what I said go in and possess right possess the lamb means you take it you go in and possess the land right for the priest which bear the ark verse 10 stood in the midst of Jordan until everything was finished right see people were servants we're servants song leaders and we are servants I want people to realize that we are servants to the people in the congregation right amen and you should have this in your posted in your brain until everything was finished those priests didn't move exactly they stood still right there in the middle of Jordan Waters was pushed back until everything was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to speak unto the people according to all that Moses commanded Joshua and the people hasted and passed over all right and then verse 14 say on that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel and they feared him as they feared Moses all the days of his life all right now here we go in chapter 5 and we'll be finished right here now they already what they done was they had waited Brother Richard they waited till they got everything in order oh yeah priest stood in the water water receded back the people walk across into the promised land but they didn't just go running like a bunch of wild Banshees running around looking oh God we got the land we're here no watch this they were still in their order they were still in a camp they come went a cross and they stopped cuz remember Joshua said go over the land and then wait and then the priest if you'll keep reading when the last person crossed over when that priest that last priest foot stepped out of that right out of that water it everything went back right all right so they were in the promised land but there was something had to happen until they went and were positionally placed until they something had to happen so they can drive out these hivites Hittites and jebusites and all those other ites all right and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side Jordan 5 ver1 trying to hurry Westward and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the Sea heard that the Lord had dried up the Waters of the Jordan so let's think about this for a minute there was an internet back then there was an email so these Kings had to hear that that something happened in Jordan so so they must have been there for a little while getting ready all right that's why you you know you well let's just get into this and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the Sea heard that the Lord had dried up the Waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until we until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of Israel right remember what Rahab told him said from the time y'all got over there and beat them Kings up and did all that stuff said there's been no fight in us we hadn't even wanted to fight you in other words we would have opened up the gates of Jericho probably if you have asked us you know and let you in that's why everybody didn't want they didn't want remember the Ark of the Covenant somebody stole it one time and they took his same back cuz it caused them so much problems you know if you if you're not of God that's like when we were Sinners we didn't want nothing to do with God we didn't want we didn't want no Ark in our in our uh TV room right we want no Arc in in our in our in our room where we did our little secret things you know read in magazines and all that we didn't want art well that's exactly what these people these Kings did they don't want no Ark around nowhere yeah verse two at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make the sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskin and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcised for the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were Men of War which came out of Egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of God so it really doesn't um when Paul said circumcision or uncircumcision doesn't matter cuz they were all circumcised which was the type of the new birth but Jesus said they were everyone dead eternally separated right so that circumcision didn't do them any good because what here's the key they obeyed not the voice of God right right same way with you and I and their children whom he raised up in their stad them Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they Abode in their places in the camp till they were whole I heard a preacher preach one time said they walked a lot different yeah if you're a male you'll understand what I'm talking about you're circumcised and you're 20 or something years old you walk a little bit different until you're till you're okay but that's the way it is listen and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away exactly the reproach of Egypt from off of you right from off of you wherefore the name of this place is called gilgal unto this day which is called the hill of the force again and the children of Israel encamped in gilgal and kept the Passover on the 14th day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the marrow after the Passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the self same day and the Mana ceased on the Marl after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel Mana anymore right but they did eat of the fruit to the land of Canaan that year now and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho they lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man now this is after he's in the promised land over against him with a sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversary and he said nay but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come in other words he's here now right and Joshua fell on his face of the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord to his servant now listen here's what I saw this and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place wherein thou standest is Holy and Joshua did so now Moses Moses did the same thing but Moses Heard a Voice out of a bush Joshua saw man amen look at the Revelation right Moses saw a burning bush he heard the voice of God now afterwards we know he spoke lip to ear and saw God but Joshua is looking face to face with his captain of the host amen he said loose off your shoes from off your feet for that place where you stand is Holy now listen to this let's go to Joshua 24 and we'll be finished this is coming to the end of Joshua's life but listen to what he's telling them chapter 24 and then we're going to reading Deuteronomy but I want you to listen to this cuz I want us to realize one thing God has already prepared the land for you and I it was prepared before the foundation of the world but you and I have to go in but listen listen to what he said see if this sounds familiar verse 13 and I have he's talking about getting rid of all the verse 11 verse 11 you got all the amorites andesites canites hites gites and I delivered them into your hand now see this is after Joshua had always kill the people and I have given you a land for which you did not labor amen and cities which you built not and you dwell in them of The Vineyards and Olive yards which you planted not do you eat that sound like a future home right see in the Millennium that's not right cuz we build houses and inhabit but in the future home it's already built for us amen it's already done after we after the battle's over after all this fighting and I have given you a land for which you did not labor we're not going to build that house we're not going to build a future homehouse remember Jesus said I go away and prepare a place for you and cities you built not and you dwell in them of The Vineyards and Olive Garden which ye planted not do eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve you the Lord let's read that again and put away the doctrines which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve you the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were in the other side of the flood are the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house amen we will serve the Lord we'll not read Deuteronomy 11 because it's basically the same thing but he G he give us a land amen read the book of Joshua cuz brother Dale's been in Ephesians brother Brown preached the sermon Ephesians parallels Joshua Joshua and and Ephesians are what a a placing Joshua physically placed a group of people in the land in Ephesians Paul was trying to place the people in the land all right but now remember what did Paul place his people in the land or was he prophesying that there was a people going to be in the land that that God was going to place by what Paul said because Paul didn't have a group of people that was that was positionally placed the adoption stage the adoption on stage that's why brother R said only in this age brother and sister only in this age is the adoption what the placing amen so let's not just go over and possess the land sure I was telling them this morning in the part we're doing about about the seals I can't give them a revelation everybody's want like Daddy said this morning everybody's wanting a new message or a new somebody or a new brother Brown said rapturing faith lies in these books and tapes amen and let me paraphrase it and the ministers are going to take the big nugget right break them down into little nuggets so you can eat them right exactly so it's not some great revelation I can't give you a revelation of the first seal I can give you a guide amen right I can give you information amen but God has got to Quicken it to you we can set and that's what we've been doing for 40 years we and I'm sure Joshua and Caleb was just feeding those people full of information when we get to a certain place I guarantee you Joshua said you follow what I'm saying don't look left don't look right you follow what I'm telling you and I'm going to take you cuz I already been there Caleb's already been there Caleb was back there he was amen he was he was Joshua's Amen Corner right cuz he'd been there too but remember I preached a sermon about the other 10 lion preachers there was 10 lion preachers stood up and said we can't take it well that's what the problem's been right the 2 million listen to the 10 line preachers and it got them all killed BL ain't that right right until the day that they started believing the right people right Joshua and Caleb the Holy Ghost and the end time believer that's all of us amen let's stand I want everybody to be an active participant everybody be an active participant in in and communion and foot washing and and and exhortation and sometimes we say well we don't have tongue and interpretation well let's have the other seven until them two get here that's right which is what faith wisdom gifts all kind of gifts of of Prophecy and stuff like that hey you got to make yourself available amen right I have not made myself available for God this past year that I have been doing what I'm doing because he has consumed I don't want I want you to understand one thing all of you pray for me please but more money is not the most important thing in the world amen amen your soul is more important than any money I took a pay cut that some of you just make that much I got cut that much but that's fine that's my business right right I'm doing what I believe the Lord told me to do so you just pray that the Lord will and he'll work it out oh yeah that's right he said I'll Supply your needs not your wants sometimes we live on a lot of wants but he said I'll Supply your needs I'll not let you starve but I really want to just apologize for this past year of just and you may not even noticed it but I've noticed it jun's noticed it she told me the other day she said I'm glad glad to have the real you back but that job had just consumed me you can let that happen to you and and I let it happen to me and I should have done something a long time about ago about it but see it was not the right time that's right the right time and the right place came so and don't ever shun work work is good for you and we have to work hey Paul even the great Apostle Paul he made tense right I mean he did something he did things and we just need I don't

can't make them you can't make them but you sure can tell them that you love them amen and you're praying for them and you know what like I told him I always tell the Lord I say Lord my kids just Stir the Water cuz at the stirring of the water there was an angel there to heal their wounds just stir their water lord Glory just stir them up don't let them be easy until they come here and then you know what you're going to have a real battle but it's a good battle it's a good battle that we fight Glory you love the Lord amen let's bow our heads just for a second I know we all have knees but

I pray father that you'll just help us we need you more than anything we we don't need a a person with a name like mine or or anybody else we need you Lord to come and do as Joshua and Caleb and carry us across Lord to a Promised Land you promised it you told us nothing would stand in our way you told us that we would possess places that we didn't even build Lord you give us mana and then as we came into the promised land we ate of the Corn that was grown there in your promised land and father we pray Lord that we now will quit crying because the Mana and because of this and because of that but Lord when they went into that Promised Land you didn't hear them crying and complaining anymore that's they ate of the old corner of the land they they possessed the land they they drove out all those IES Lord I pray that today you'll drive out all the IES Lord all the things that that we have in our heart that that are not true and the things that we do Lord that you will help us Lord to bind together yes Lord we know we have the truth Lord you sent your message through a prophet and you gave us Lord the words of eternal life now father what we do with it is just like you said Joshua said said today which one will you serve but as for me in my house Lord we're going to serve the Lord amen father that that doesn't always mean a house of sticks and and stone but maybe more of a heart of Flesh or a house of Flesh Lord as for me in this house we'll ser serve the Lord father forgive us of our sins if we said anything that was wrong Lord or contrary to what you wanted Lord I pray that you'd forgive me yes Lord be with each one Lord take care of us Lord as we head into the communion we give you all the praise and honor and Glory that that you give us an institution

for the communion that's coming up Lord we ask your blessings in Jesus name amen amen we don't go it a little late they go ahead and do the do the communion but the Lord bless you I want to tell you truly I had a life-changing experience bless and I wanted to share it with you and this is all lifechanging it all way from job all the way to this but see I we don't need to worry about those things let's wor let's focus Joshua and Caleb that's what I want you to get if you get nothing else one thing Joshua and Caleb took a group and got them so focused to where they just reacted when Joshua and Caleb told them what to do they just fell right in line the priest went first Joshua was just set he just sat there and he just talked to them you do this you do this you do this you do this you do well is the holy spirit confused I don't think so the holy spirit is what's placing all this together he's not confused that's right and we're not supposed to be you know the blind leading the blind but you know we are sheep right and sheep can't do nothing for theel sheep have to be led we all think we're real strong well yeah we may be strong but we're still Sheep amen Jesus said we were sheep so we're sheep and we have to have a Shepherd that takes that staff and you know puts us in the way that's why the hooks on the end of it so he can reach and get you sometime and jerk you back in the fold same way with the word of God but it's done with kindness and it's done with reverence and it's done with fear of the Lord there's not a lot of time left people and I'm not trying to scare anybody but there's not a lot of time left right we can say that but even a day we're a day closer to to getting the glory than we were yesterday amen right amen let's all do one thing bind together right keep that old root of bitterness out of us get it away from us um you know just be a family like like brother Keith said be a family it's a family gathering let's just be a family amen you know it's like I always said you know family may fight in the back yard among yourself that's right but don't come in the front yard fighting my brother you got to deal with me me and my brother may fight in the backyard but don't deal with you going to deal with me if you fight with my brother in the front yard all right so the same way we tell with the devil we might have little squabbles but Satan if you come up on my porch you got to deal with the whole family you ain't got to deal with just one you going to deal with the whole family that's why when we bind together and start praying for each other and we become and get real Earnest things are going to happen when we get real Earnest something has got to happen cuz God's going to hear amen our prayer I promise you that let's take a communion Lord bless you bless you amen right can I say something yes sir uh I want tell something how prayer been answer a few weeks ago I can't remember exactly what it Wasa Kathy she asked us all

it and that's what that's what he he said something to me and I said well I want you to take apart I want you to do and take a part and do because that's that's what we want CU what did Brother R say in adoption manasse raising corn in ephraim's cornfield that won't never work right you're raising corn but it won't work right he said get in your field where you're supposed to be that's right supposed to be sitting on a Pew warming the Pew set up one the you just be there to keep it War see if you want to sing sing for the glory of the Lord that's right you preaching preach for the glory of the Lord that's right playing the musicians whatever do it for the glory of the Lord that's right so what everything will be in order and that way won't be try to take each other's place we'll be right in the place right amen so just you know pray for way and and you know everything the Lord would would give him the desire of his heart and right said then may we all find our place that's right to be able to do what we're supposed to be doing and that'll take care of it okay let's go right into the communion and if you want to turn with us in 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also so he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged that's the scripture I love right there that's right but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together t one for another to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will set in order when I come let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer just praying one for the other and just remembering you know each other in the Lord that's right and everything before we go on into the communion thank you Father because we love you we commit all into your hands in Jesus name now anybody have anything to say before we go into the communion the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose today and Lord Jesus we know that it represents Thy word it's not thy body but it represents Thy word that as we eat the word and Lord as our brother just read when they entered the promised land the the old the the manist and it become the old corn of the land which was a stronger understanding what's the same bread Lord we thank you for this and we ask you to just give us an understanding of Thy word that we may Lord all be together as you we ask you to sanctify the bread and the partakers that we may may all be together as one in the Lord in Jesus name never do this and I I think about the children of Israel in their final night before they left heading toward the promised land they had the communion they had a natural meal back there but then there was the things that was left over that they didn't truly understand then Jesus took that and they and he said all right now this part is what we're going to do we're going to I'm going to show you what this means and he opened their understanding of the scriptures of what he was doing and how they what they done all of the times in the Years before and he instituted what we call the the Lord's Supper it's a serious matter because what we used to do when we was in the churches years ago we we'd order bread and keep it for 3 months and put it in the freezer do all like that see we didn't know what it meant did right amen then we use grape juice things are those order father we thank you for this wine it's gone through the process and now Lord gets better each day and that's a an example of your love and grace unto each one of us and the greatest of all the Revelation that you given to each one of our hearts we ask you now Lord that you would just bless it it's an example of your blood which was shed for each one of us but lord it's not the blood but it's just an example of it it's not the the the things of life that we need we need only you we love you and we thank you we ask you as we take the bread and then to drink the little portion of wine that it'll come together in our bodies and Lord tomorrow it'll make blood sails in each and every one of us we love you and we thank you sanctify the wine and the partakers in Jesus name come morning I walk by the riv I the everam I'll car my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes desp and rejected and I question then I take one more look at M G and it gives me the strength to go home come morning I by the river I'll rest me the evere I'll carry my cross through the mid come morning for me you know people might say well I've never been to a communion where that they sang and done and there's always been a light reverence well that's that's good that's just not the way we do here we just are different people but you know I got it marked in my Bible in the Book of Psalms there that there was like three Psalms that they sang as they were entering the temple for worship you know coming in and uh you know that would be something if we just line up outside you know sing those songs as we came in to bringing us into the presence of the Lord to where we would do that see we don't do it but we should pray and get ourselves right and get our thoughts in the right order as we're coming in because we're coming in to serve God and coming in to hear from him they believe so much until they found a scroll one time that they hadn't been able to had had and yep you know what they done and I think it took about six hours seem like that they read the scroll and then they worshiped for six hours you know am now because they really realized see we found something from God that we didn't have amen so then we you know we cherish it right amen let's all protect together you can be seated for a moment while we get ready for now have the put worship John 13 and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas his carot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel where with he was Gerty then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said sayth unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me Simon Peter Sith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus Sith unto him he that is wash needeth not Sav to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say un you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him is if you know these things happy are you if you do them let's stand together we'll be dismissed and those sisters can go downstairs for the foot washing father we thank you for the day and thank you for the word we've heard this afternoon and we believe it Lord we ask you to just help each one of us as we come and and be as as our brother has brought to us to try to find our place a position in you and and to walk there in that we may see you and be glor May glorify you and
