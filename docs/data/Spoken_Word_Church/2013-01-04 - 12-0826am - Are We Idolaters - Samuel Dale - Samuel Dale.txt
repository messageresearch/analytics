amen I want to see you amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures we're going to change today not we're going to make an insert into the message I have a little thought on my mind so we'll just take this this morning and then this afternoon we'll come back on to the study in the Book of Revelation so if you'd like to turn to First Corinthians where W was preaching by Wednesday really enjoyed it first Corinthians 6 we will read those scriptures just a thought that's been on my heart for really it's been on there for many years amen about something that I'm wondering if we're missing the um correct understanding sometimes of things amen and uh you know this has just been there and uh you know I've been pondering how to speak on it and maybe I can get my point across today but it'll be just kind of a little insert into the the study we've been on Amen so if you'd like to and I don't want Mark yet so I was going to use that but we won't use Mark we use First Corinthians 6 okay amen father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things and we ask you to just come Lord and be with us and guide each and every one of us give us understanding ears that we may hear what you have to say unto each one amen and Lord forgive our sins because mainly that's our Point yes CU We Know by doing that if you forgive us then we stand complete amen and we love you Lord and we want to be that and do as we know that it's been taught us by Thy word that we want to walk therein that we can have confidence Lord in in knowing that you will hear our prayers and answer them and lead us in thy understanding amen have your way now bless the sick among us Lord you know that Brother Gary there Atkins Lord is was in the hospital for a couple of days and in a all but possibly going home today and we just ask you to to bless him and take care of him and thank you for all things that you've given us we love you in Jesus name amen First Corinthians now remember um oh to a sister Fay uh up at Brother Richard sister vs uh she's got a problem with her back so remember that that the Lord would touch her I've got it written down here for us to pray about but just remember also now remember the Lord willing this coming Wednesday brother Samson Shetty will be here with us preaching for us on Wednesday all right then uh brother PR's son Samuel will be here with with us on the 9th of September and then the fellowship meeting will be on I guess what is the 15th every what it fall 14 15 but anyhow it be the third Saturday it's that brother lorus right yes I missed that one cuz I thought we was going somewhere else and there in November but still we'll go one place or the other you know we'll bit one of them but all right but just remember that right that's all of the announcements I've got Bible study U Bible study yes first is on Saturday the first is on Saturday so it will be this this coming Saturday so remember that Bible study and what are we on we're still on WE justification justification right yeah we're on justification we're going to go through that and and things and speak on those things so remember that the bible study this coming Saturday at 6:00 right 1 Corinthians 69- 11 and just remember these things amen know you not that the unrighteous shall inherit the kingdom of God shall not excuse me the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor dors nor adulterers nor feminite or abusers of themselves with unkind nor thieves nor Covetous and nor drunkards nor rers and nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you but you're washed but you are Sanctified and you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now you know we look at those things and we think well now no we we we're not any of these things come on now uh and even if we do we want to make sure we we get it all in the past right you know and that's that's fine but you know we look at the words and what I would ask you to do sometimes is just take these words and look them up right yes sir you know just go to the dictionary and just look up these words go over there in Galatians where it's talking about the works of the flesh you know Murder Envy stri addition well I never killed nobody well you know if you hate your brother without a the Bible says You're a murderer look them up and just see if you can find yourself in some of these things am no no I'm a born again Christian well that may be true but you know we may still have some problems and that's what I want to deal with today is something there's one in there that you know I remember years ago that I had heard brother brandom make the statement and uh I had mentioned this to brother brother Mo and uh brother George I think now I'm not certain but I know it was brother Mo and they were both laughing at me because of the way I pronounce the word but see there we read you know that idolators right idolators yeah and you know I remember hearing the prophet one day said you know how do you going to be an idolator y it just let God be Idol in your life that's right that's right now I tell you what now I a I ain't got no Idols in my home I ain't got no Idols in this I don't have no Idols nowhere but the prophet said that just let God be Idol in your life that's right see and it was really pronouncing I was ID of dollar Tre somewhere you know and that's where I said it cuz that's way I meant it and I can't even pronounce it the way I said it then but they were life in way because it it just means simply you let God be Idol in your life right and you can be an idolator no no no no brother Dale an idolor is one that gets before and bows down and does all of these things you know and all that's that's pretty good thinking but that's not all the point the word idolators it's a worship of false gods right right that's the the definition amen out of out of your 19 1496 out strongs concordance right it can even be a Christian participating in any way in the worship of the Heathen right amen see we think it's got to be going for an idol you know and bowing and doing all things right uh could we be an idolator and not know it right amen that's just a simple point it's been on my mind for many years and I just you know you say but but brother Dale we we we're Christians and and we're not idolators well Paul said such for some of you amen that's right all right so evidently we must have been somewhere yeah and probably they wouldn't be any of us in here that ever even in our sinful life you know when we lost that ever went to an ID and bowed down to it you know or any form of doings right right and I don't believe Paul was just talking about people who have done a lot of those things see because it could be we just let God be Idol in our lives right amen we just don't put him as number one right amen very simple y see now Paul was against as he was bringing as I brought the definition from the strong you know you don't want to eat things offered to sacrifices you know like that not that it's wrong the bases of uh you know maybe in you but he said it's where others see you right y because you you know you go down to the store and you buy a piece of meat you don't ask the the the teller to tell you whether that has been offered uh you know as a sacrifice and yeah to an you know to a God and then uh take it in and butchered and and you wind up with a hamburger out out of there you know you know you don't do stuff like that that's not uh see so Paul when he was just saying it it's something that you know yourself and he said it's for other people's sake right right because they see you eating meat offered to a sacrifice you know altar on it or something and they you know they be offended or hurt by it right because they're young and they're weak and and you don't want to do those things right so kind of keep that in mind now as we go along through something because you know I I want us to think about it the worship of Idols we said we know that's wrong mhm right we know it's wrong to worship idols that's right sure but you know I've been told in this message that you need to keep a picture of Jesus you know and there's a quote to the form keep a picture of Jesus and when you pray go stand before the picture to get your mind on the Lord you know and that may sound like a good point but you mean I've got to get to do that to be able to pray I've got to be able to see a picture to be able to remember who I'm praying to or whatever yeah I remember one time uh listening to brother random and I coming home from work and he was talking about how that we put up these or the people put up these images you know and and I remembered the story there of the Spinx you know the things the the lines that are there before the The Pyramid in Egypt and and you think well now those were put there to guard you know they were were uh Idols you know images and I thought well wish sure don't have anything like that and I thank you Lord and I pull up in my yard and I looked and and there was a swan on each side of the or a duck one I can't remember which one each side of the walkway was a swan you know and I began the life because I was that's what I was thinking about right if you come to our homes sometimes and you think well no you could go down to an idol worshippers home you could really see well it wouldn't be necessarily right you know wouldn't be necessarily that you could see it all right now could it be that we can worship idols and think we're worshiping God sure very serious amen brother randam said you can call him Jesus Jesus and worship the devil sure you know I'm glad that the Bible says that God Winks at our ignorance yes that's right amen I'm glad of that scripture because I believe we've had a whole lot of ignorance and probably a lot of stupidity to go with it but what about calling him Jesus Jesus and be worshiping the devil right amen now what about the scribes and Pharisees claiming to serve the true and living God and yet he was standing before them right yep now who was they worshiping at the time he was standing before them right right come on right amen serious sure who are they worshiping they were singing they were worshiping they were praying they were going through all of their daily rituals and and prayers of long lengthy uh prayers every day and and there was God walking among them right amen odd situation then right the most religious people that has ever been in the world were the scribes and Pharisees right right amen yeah so then we can't say well it's all on sincerity that's right right what about where the Prophet said people feed their babies to alligators to appease a God that's right that's pretty sincere isn't it right amen so we don't just put it on sincerity that's right amen it has to be bed based upon something else it has to be based upon two things one is the word yes amen that's right all right the other is a personal experience amen amen that's right and if those two are not together what are we doing right amen that's right now come on just be serious minded in yourself for a moment and think I don't ask for a raise of hands cuz everybody's handing you already to go up if he didn't go up I tell you it's a liar not putting it up we all worshiped Gods sure man no no no no no no mhm M what did did you believe in a trinity well I don't been through all of that so don't worry about it I've had people to tell me say well God knows who I'm worshiping yeah yeah but do you know who you're worshiping that's what people will say to you right God knows my heart yes he knows that I love him he knows that I'm wor shiing him right I don't have to be able to get all the names right right a little woman one day tried to contact the Lord Jesus about a healing and he said it's not right for me to take the children's bread and give it to a dog y That's Right amen but you know she had more understanding than all them scribes and Pharisees that's right amen because she had enough understanding to realize there was something about the man so she said true but the dogs get the crumbs that fall from the master's table right right he said I found S no such faith in Israel that's right amen right what about it pull up Mark there brother Joe and M do I told him I give him all a rest today just think a few things and you know I already got this evening lined up so they don't even have to sit back there you knowbody can sit out here and we really appreciate these brothers what they do also for before we forget it uh remember on the uh not this coming weekend now but the on the 8th we're supposed to be up at uh brother Bill y's Church to have a ministers meeting and it's on Daniel 70 weeks and Wade and I are supposed to speak before you know we they're designated speakers now and they're we're going to speak a little bit before we get into questions and answers for so remember that amen amen mainly that we will both have the right attitude right amen and it's kind of like brother Reed said he we were just talking going down the road the other day and he said brother Dale I know it's been hard for some of your older ones that really know the message and have tried to study it and teach it to the people and people won't receive it but said maybe now's the time right and Wade was bringing out last night you know what brother Claude weinger was saying that you know the Bible does say that it would be in the last days when the Daniel 70 weeks would be able to be understood that's right amen you know cuz that would be it's the book sealed up in the Book of Daniel right right until the end right well just pray for us that the Lord would help us you remember years ago we were fixing to go to one that was going to be on a topic and the Lord spoke to me right over in the corner there of what the scripture truth was and when we got there that was the very scripture the man brought up right well I felt pretty good yeah because I already had the answer right all right so just pray that we'll have the right answer right attitude okay look at Mark now look at what the Lord Jesus now what who is he God Almighty amen standing there and look what he says he answered and said unto them well have isaas prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is written the people honored me with their lips y but their heart is far from me now look what he says how be it in vain they being in vain do they worship me right yeah now how is it that you worship God how is it you can worship God in vain simply the next few words right right teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men y y so now do you see why brother around would say you can say Jesus Jesus and worship the devil amen right cuz if you got the doctrines of men Y how can you be worshiping the true God that's right amen now we go back to the while go God knows my heart yeah if he didn't we'd be in pretty good shape yeah right that's right that's right look what he says for laying aside the Commandment of God right yep now you notice singular commandment right y now watch he's talking about worship right right yep we're laying aside the commandment of God what is the first commandment amen one not all of them what's the first cuz that's what he's saying right he's dealing with worship of God right what's the first commandment there's only one Lord amen right amen and his name is one right amen that's right so anything besides true worship in spirit and in truth amen is idolatry amen right amen you see how serious you see why I've been thinking on it for many many years to try to present a way you know to see what's on my heart with thinking about it for laying aside the Commandment of God you hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things you do and he said unto them for will well you reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition amen what about rejecting God because of your own thinking our teaching right yep I said now I thank God for that scripture that he said I went at your ignorance right but what's the rest of that scripture but says now he commands all men to repent right right repent for what for idolatry right amen Y come on folks you understand what I'm saying from the pull pit to the back of the building we were all in idolatry oh we belied in a trinity or either a Oneness right until this message came to straighten us out and bring us to truth we could not be worshiping in spirit and in truth right amen right right see sincerity that's all people talk about well you know God knows I love him he knows his name I don't have to know it like I said you got too many things in the Bible to give us problems what about the little lady that was saying thy son of David she was a gentile she said th son of David have mercy on me why didn't he answer cuz she didn't have a right to call him son David that's right righten right that was to the Jews she was a gentile but when she said my Lord yeah he was her Lord amen that's right the answer brother R said it's got to be the right approach right amen sister had Right Said brother random that ain't nothing but the truth he said right approach right got her the salvation of her two boys course yours all those in the days you know that we're in were all of these talking about the brother random hunt at the wrong time and doing all the other things you know they was told later those two boys backslid I don't care how long they stay backslid right amen right right nothing to me that's their problem right they're coming right why cu the prophet said it where you this F with me could our worship be in vain Lula Georgia sure not to the world that's they're just listening thank God for the listeners we got a big list back our long it showed up on one certain town there and I really did get a good cackle out of that one but let go going out there and people are listening but you out there listening remember I'm talking to you now if I'm not your pastor but while you listening to it you you you know you're responsible okay so you're just as responsible as the ones that are sitting here in the building that calls me their Pastor now could you worship God in vain sure now Jesus said you do it because of your teaching of your traditions right doctrines come on folks that's why I'm so hard I know I'm I know I'm hard but I mean you take a two Soul Doctrine and try to worship God which God am I worshiping right if I got two Souls I got have two Gods that's right I got two Gods I'm trinitarian y right I'm not hateful that's that ought to be true true amen but how many of us used to believe in the trinity amen see let's don't make lie to somebody else right didn't we all used to believe in a trinity or a Oneness or some form amen sure well then we've worshiping God in vain that's right right the Bible says you shall know the truth and it'll set you free amen not know about it right and I go back to that oh but I'm sincere you ain't fed your kids to the alligator right could we be worshiping here in vain and we certainly wouldn't be like others that we think of you know the children of Israel they actually put their kids through fire mhm under molok every how you pronounce it that's right m o l e c or something like that that's right you mean the people of God mhm you mean the people of God that had seen all the things down in Egypt and all the destruction of all of that and get out there and MH some way convince Aaron to make a golden cave yeah come on right and they were going to take that golden C and they wern't going back to Egypt as slaves you know better than that they were going back as borus to say this is the god that killed you you fool with us he'll get you again right but they danc before those that Idol y they done all kind of things thought they was worshiping yep could it be that that they thought because we'll get to the statement in a minute could it be that they thought that their God had condescended into that Idol right like I said I don't think they going back to Slaves you I don't think they doing that I think they were going to go back is Victorious right mhm could it be that they thought they were right I mean there was only Moses was the only fell left that wasn't involved in it right yep no you say well now wait just a minute well now the rest of them wouldn't do anything about it right come on be plain Moses was the only one now when he come back down with his presence everybody else jumps up and says Moses I'm on your side yeah but what was he doing till Moses came down they might not have been dancing but you ever notice kids you know that it's kind of made that way I guess but you take them around where the music is playing and them little kids you know and they've never been taught this it's just something about it you know you understand what I'm saying sure we're all of the tribes of Israel out there somewhere pretty close that a wild that they had Y what about it Amen brother said that people will even believe and bow before an idol and he says that they don't necessarily believe that that Idol is their God so they believe that that Idol is in an image form or likeness or something of their God you know because they know if that gets burnt up they just get them another one you remember that's what uh Abraham or Abram was doing you know who was it his daddy-in-law that was making Idols or something and Dad and he was out there happing him and and he's worshiping them Idols too or either he was just going along the whole thing until the true one come along and then he just burn up the story of the old Jewish story is that he he just broke them all up and he said he left one he said you know you know they got into a fight last night all these gods did said this one won you that's old Jewish Fable yeah but think about it but around and said you can bow before an ID in an imaginary way believing that your God came into that idle right and said even your voices sure come on don't you think Satan can speak sure he knew how to use the tongue of a beast abely but I'm just asking this a simple question how do you know that you're not in idolatry right now right remember we're in the day of all full responsibility right amen right so we have no excuse and God's not going to wink at are ignorance right there's no excuse to have doctrines like in this message right amen that's right but the biggest problem is and you know it's true you can have a guy with a Doctrine he get him another doctorine two or three Doctrine he's more popular than somebody that stands up and says that's not right true right sure you remember when Moses the ground opened up and swallowed up all of those people you remember the next day yeah they come to Moses and you know what they say Moses you kill the people of God right yeah boy that's something read your Bible mhm it don't take a whole lot for us to be in idolatry amen so started what I said let him be idle y that's my problem I don't know about you right amen the biggest one I have is letting him be idle right but I keep my mind on so many other things instead of keeping it on Goden right man I want to try to illustrate cuz this is what's been on my mind so just think wom me listen you know since the beginning of time man being a creature that was created by a Creator would put him into a position to want to serve that Creator right right amen you know make all kind of things to try to appease satisfied you know they're God you go all the way down through the Bible and you find like I said even the children of isra running their children Through Fire to try to appease a god that is dead now there's plenty of gods but those gods are just the the the point of the mind because there's only one God right the others are not Gods right they're concoctions of somebody yeah it makes up some kind of a form and call them Gods right Amen brother brother P said there I think he said 3 million gods and goddesses right y over in India y we know Paul run up out of Mars heill he found all these things all these things and there one little maybe a what you call it little pedestal sitting there and you know and they wrote down under it just in case we miss him this will be the unknown God Paul said now that's the one I want to talk to you about right amen amen is the unknown God CU there's one thing for certain they know they didn't know who that was right am now wouldn't it been something brother dick for me to come in the presbyter in church and I'm not throwing off on just making statements AR Baptist anywhere else go to anybody but I see all of this set up there in representation you know the cross the the different things and that's no problem we have them around here pictures and and all you know but yet you go in there and you say all of these Gods you got I want to talk to you about the unknown God right that's right that's exactly right I want to talk to you about Jesus Christ amen but what you me we worshiped him all of our lives every one of these things in here is in representation of him so talk to you about the unknown God right amen cuz you see if you don't know the truth all gods are unknown amen that's right amen there's only one God Amen what about it y simple thoughts amen all kind of doctrines and ideas and gods and goddesses you know that they all have somebody who is their high priest or whatever you want to call him you know not those words necessarily for everybody but you know what I mean by it everybody's got their representation right sure you know and they want to send somebody to represent that y kind of makes me think about that man brother dick that me and you were talking about that time that was a the it was a Church of Christ but he just totally backslid you know I mean but when they wanted somebody to argue the Church of Christ Doctrine they go get that old guy that even just totally back you know cuz he was good with words I'm sure you know see it didn't make no difference to them whether he was a Christian or not right they just wanted somebody to be able to convince the others well what about it is this message just a a doctrinal issue yeah all right or is it a revelation of a person amen so we say then as I said while ago the first is word the second would have to be a personal experience right amen you know something real to you right right now here's Abram you know he become labor Abraham Paul picks it up in Romans you know and he said that Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness right but we turn his way sitting holding the book up and looking at both sides we look back and it was really Abram that done it right he starts off yeah he doesn't wait till you get away on over here to start having him as a Believer yeah you know right Abram was the one that believed God right sure y because when he spoke to him about the 12th chapter somewhere right along in there you know God just spoke to him Y and he said Abram get up leave where you're at right all your Idols you know yeah yep and said just come walk with me well we know is I guess wait to bring that to the night but somebody was just recently that you know Abram he he took his family he took lot he took yeah you know everybody with him which that was what God Said but I mean that was sensible that wasn't bad you know because you know you want your family to see the truth don't you well you ain't going to just say well the door's closed when you find God the way I got him you get back in this door until then stay out that's kind of the way we are right you ain't going to win nobody that way right but oh ABR he just gets up you know and he just he hears a voice something spoke to him right and what made him any different oh he was a seed see there you message people yeah they just SE this thing to death you know yeah right like I was thinking the other day about where were they using the uh Judah and the Tamar you know to extend the lineage well you better go back and read your Bible Judah and Tamar had two kids yeah they just didn't have one right yeah they had two kids that was twins right I say the lineage went down to Perez or what his name is well you know both of them come from one man right that was Judah right y but you see we just don't think but just get the point now why did Abram believe God you know that there's like the prophet that said you know there's people that just can't believe that's right I told you about that old man down at work and in his mouth his name was Dozer and brother was talking to him about them going out in the desert you know I mean going up into the moon and thing he he went out there the desert somewhere so down you know he wouldn't believe it right well you know what if you tapped him on the head and sent him up to the moon and woke him up he wouldn't believe it then he said I didn't just got this place made around here I find my door get out and I'll be back home you know all right but what makes the difference amen come on why is it so emphatically states that Abraham believed God who imputed yes right amen well there's Abram he's got a good living going help his daddy-in-law make idols and something and he's doing fine and he says get up and go y you know what yeah he just got up and WI right right right right well now my point is is we talk about believing that's what I want to dwell on right MH amen well I believe well you know Abram believed enough of what spoke to him to get up and leave all of the Comforts that he had and all of the things and go marching and didn't know where he was going that's right what does it mean that you can believe I just believe well there was one day you believed God was three persons righten right you Tau that you believed it y so what about it no Abram just gets up and he just starts walking cuz there was just something about what spoke to it something about the voice y that spoke to it and I don't believe that he heard an audible I may different you may different brother I may you say it I'm not I'm just tring to make a point I don't believe he necessarily heard an audible voice out loud you know get up and come and go with me it's just something inside of him is anything ever really ever spoke to you inside of you I mean just literally spoke to you that you knew right that there was no way anybody could take away from you what was said you get the point brother whby had a good point he said you can get them in with a hot dog and get them out with the hamburger that's right simple Point somebody can convince you today that there's a trinity tomorrow he can convince you their Oneness is right right but oh AB he just gets up and starts walk okay now all of the contacts that God made with him of mzd and all Etc is in his life's journey right that's fine right but he got up and left right what about it there was a man out there one day in the Bible that was gathering his wheat and stuff and he knew the enemy was coming so they would gather a little bit and they'd hide it in the caves and things and you know cuz they knew the enemy was coming to get to B and they hide enough to maybe make it a year and enough to plan or something and he was out there doing that right amen and here they come do you know something spoke to him might have been an angel come down said Gideon you're a mighty man of Valor he said no I'm a sticking coward yeah I would be hiding this fruit in I mean this stuff in the cave I was really a you know yeah but you know something just spoke to him you know what he said I'm true ain't running no more y you you going to get my wheat you going to have to kill me y right come on I'm just making plain language right you read your Bible we get plain language when you read it amen he just don't something told me that mhm you know I believe it right you got to just started SS yeah killing a bunch of them run them all off Y what about it how many more illustrations do you need Through the Bible to be able to understand right I'm asking a simple question have you ever really heard the voice of God that's right right from within yes you said when I brother R would hear his voice you know that's all right I told you about the man at work that said the Lord spoke to him in an audible voice told him get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right yeah he got baptized father son Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus Christ now that was what God Said right then he said an audible voice I'm not going to argue with him do I believe God can speak in an audible voice but what about it what do you base your whole Christian experience upon amen when I go to church I believe the Mage it's all Pharisees y amen right right right only the worst part of it they're sadu sees you know the difference the Pharisees and the Sadducees one of is Happy other is sad carnal comparison but true because the Sadducees didn't believe in nothing they didn't believe in no Resurrection or nothing so they're sad yeah well that's just what I'm looking at now is a lot of sad faces am I looking at Sadducees or yeah a lot of you are sad I see it would be a best way of saying it that's right what do you base your life on right amen I get the point cuz like I told you I've been I don't really know 10 years at least thinking about this and a way to presented God just spoke to Abram and he got up and Loud was he anything different than anybody else right I said that's where all the people of the message in the preacher they want to preach about this seed stuff well he was a seed and that's why that that he would be like that if that be true I still ask you the same question right has God ever spoke to you to where you know where you're at right yes like I told you when he spoke to me right over there in the corner we was going to a meeting it was going to be and I was going to have to face a theologian on marriage and divorce right and I had no fear whatsoever amen that's right why because he done spoke right amen you ever been that way are can somebody talk you out of what you believe right you're two soul today a seven under tomorrow or peria the next day or river Jordans or what all the new ones are coming I don't know and like I said you know there's always a Kingpin or a hierarchy or something that you know they'll tell you the way to get to heaven is you got to believe in this and and you know you got to do this and like Catholicism you got certain things to go through or some of the denominations you got to go through steps before you can be accepted into the Believers of that group you know they got them in the message you don't believe what I preach you're lost oh oh yeah what about it have always thought and said I used to too brother colie hear this you'll know it we were coming back out of Carolina talking about something one day and I said brother collie I ain't got but one desire I said to plant enough word into your heart until if something happens to the man you're listening to that you will keep on going and you won't be bickering over what to do or let's go play the tapes of brother Dale yeah right we've got them all now we've captured them I said I want you to be able to stand on your own two feet that's right that's my desire for everybody in this church amen is if you're not to be carried about by every men I mean wind of doctrines and ideas and thoughts to be able to stand on what you believe right and have an experience with God like way was talking about the other day see I'm telling them how many times God spoke to different people in the days of Abraham absolutely right yeah sure remember we get over the New Testament a little while many are called but few are chosen right that's right many people are called that's right but there's a few chosen right amen what's the difference the called and the chosen you know we play with scriptures and don't think of them seriously Jesus said no man can come to me Y unless my father amen draw him right amen that's right have you ever felt the drawing the pool so that's why that I'm not too much on the alter called in the bases of what we we was used to you know back in organized religion that's right and going out and getting somebody you know and go down the aisle and talk to them and tell them you need to come to the Lord you need to quit this or quit that and do this or do that what's the difference in all that than the traditions of men we just read what's the difference in that than the the uh order or are ways you have to be to come in to believe a certain kind of a hedonistic Doctrine or or an idol worship amen I think some I'm pretty dumb but true right you Islamic you can die in a holy war and you get 70 virgins when you get to heaven number Bo ain't that something I had heard yet what the women Getz a lot of them D now right yeah maybe they get to be one of them virgins I don't know I have no problem with it I'm just serious of telling you we life at those things right yes but didn't you know yourself people will stand up and skin you alive with this message to try to make you believe it right oh they can do a wonderful job of laying it all down they can turn right around and take up an offer and INF flie you forever dime you got in your pocket the same anointing amen see that's why you don't see me do that and that's why you don't see me we give an alter call you come that's right but you're going to come on your own brother R said if you get that person and bring them up he said they're going to be a two-fold child of Hell the next time now that's his words you're doing more damage than good oh but up brother D I feel L yeah you felt led to be a trinitarian yeah I'm not against leading of God I believe in it sure a lot of people don't read and listen to brother Randon he said if I see a vision he said and that Hat's got to be over here he said I can't move that hat everybody wants to shout about that don't they but you know what he said one day he said we ain't got time he moved a hat yeah he said we ain't got time and he prayed and the person was healed immediately well that's cuz he know what he was doing and what he believed amen right sure would you see what I'm talking about yes we think we're so anointed we're so LED of God could it be that we're worshiping God in vain right amen I hope you understand what I'm saying amen I'm as serious as it can be Amen to me to believe a two Soul Doctrine or accept of virt all those doctrinal issues among the me is to me just as trinitarian as any other trinitarian because I can prove it to you by their own Doctrine right sure amen you got two Lords your trinitarian but no he ain't got it he ain't got three boy that's good straight A anything contrary to truth right amen is worshiping the devil right right amen right amen what about it what was the difference in all of those people back there that we've talked about in the the message of being you know and especially getting in the New Testament and talking about the writing of the book and what is the difference I mean here's Martin Luther studying the Bible he was a scholar he was that's all he done yes right yeah how many times had he read that scripture the just shall live by faith probably made uh discourses or what you call them uh studies on it made uh probably taught uh classes about it we didn't one day it something bounced off the page and struck him right that's right where was it at outwardly Elijah was in the cave it wouldn't all of the Thunders and the Lightnings and the things what was it a still Small Voice right amen an inward voice right Amen on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell we talk about tongues of fire sitting on them but you know the reason it was is because inside of them was the Holy Spirit that's right tongue setting on you do you know good that's right anointing on you won't do you any good that's right you ain't got something down in the Heart Right amen have you had a person of experience with God that you know that God is real amen right and what if you were taken right now and put on the desert island all by yourself would you be a Christian you know just a carnal comparison right would you a Christian yes if you didn't have anybody else to prop you up with I'm very serious folks I'd rather be left with one person sitting in this building that had had an experience with God and for every one of these pews to be full the people has never had one right amen yes sir abely was not that what was it Martin or Columbo one said he never satisfied that everybody in this church had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and led of the spirit of God right that's all my desire amen that's right if I die and go to hell and miss a whole thing I would just love to be able for God to say one thing as I'm going toward hell thank you for helping them yeah right amen true thank you for helping them cuz they found Christ through what you said right amen that's always been my desire but desire to get you to have an experience amen what's the difference in Abraham H what's the difference in any of those men back there now you want to make it all kind of seeds you got a problem running it through the scriptures with me anyway cuz you got a guy like Samson out there living in adultery doing all kind of things and yet he still knows that he's anointed sure you got a man like David right adulterous having his best friend kill to get his wife God says he's a man after my own heart that's something man now we certainly know that that's not God's heart that was in all that adulterous and all those act my life right amen but the Bible said that your sacrifice and your offerings is become a stink in my nostrils right we said I look to those so an honest and a contrite heart amen that scripture have you had an experience in your heart that you know where you standing right or is this just I got to go to church that's right come on I'm going to be preached that if I don't go yeah or is it something real brother R said if you have Christ in your heart now he didn't say if you were led by a bunch of other things he said if you got Christ in your heart you can't wait till the door open that's right right right amen I don't have to worry about preaching it do I right y I thought we said that the Bible said You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free right amen I thought we believe that he sent his word and healed us amen amen right amen and delivered us from from destruction do you realize what they're saying yes all these others and I'm not thr off on nobody you know that I'm just truthful all these other great faith healers and all kind of thing they got to build everything up they got to get everything to go they got to sing they got to worship and do everything right amen that's right here's brother brandham says now let's just be real quiet right let's just be real quiet now so don't be jumping up running around now cuz you're going to hinder somebody else that's right let's just think about it said just get the Lord on your mind and just think about him that's right the still Small Voice and you'd rather have the one outwardly or the one inwardly right amen which one which one do you want you can take the outward voice as I said about the boy that told me that God spoke to him in an audible voice told him to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and some of you may not heard the story so I'll relate it he went to a Baptist preacher and the Baptist preacher baptized him and he said he baptized me both ways well I immediately stopped him and said hold it I'm going to tell you what you've done you had that man to baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then he baptized you in Father Son and Holy Ghost he said you're right I said you never was baptized you erased it y I said had you been to where you didn't know then let him baptize you in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost and then baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said God would have been sincere but God told you to get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right he told me he said don't talk to me no more about what that man Brown says you can only put it in your own words don't tell me what he said he wasn't talking to Brandon when he was talking to me yeah right right right I don't say that disrespectful he wasn't talking to brother Brown he's talking to me I was the one that come up with the point of saying that but listen church I'm sure that boy is probably still going to church still to serve God yep see the Audible Voice you can hear it you can be talked out of it that's right because all things is audible y right and you can use a way to of matter of convincement to win the person over through their head sure and was not that where Satan went in the garden that's right yep am I true he went to the head to convince Eve y but if God spoke in the heart you can't take that out of a person that's right am that's right that's why you see people that can be saved that's what I said Jesus said you can't come to me unless my father draw right so it wouldn't matter how many alar calls we had begged and pleaded and all to get your children saved that's not going to save one of them that's right right even if it does it's going to make a two-fold child the hell out of them because they're going to come to the altar because mom and daddy wanted them there I'm never my kids are sitting here all three of them sitting here the grandkids are sitting here I know I'm a very bad granddaddy on know a father and a husband and all but I never believed in trying to convince anybody of anything I've never tried to convince my wife and she's sitting right there she can tell you I've never tried to convince her of what something was right right I've tried to tell her what was right tried to tell the kids what was right the grandkids the daughter-in-laws they came to our home when they were still in the world before they ever come to the Lord and they came to our home dressed wrong and different thing I never said a word to one of them they're both sitting back there now they can get up and say it see I never said a word to them right cuz I know if God don't speak to you inwardly that's right all I'm making is a convert that's right a convert to a Doctrine a convert to an idea or a precept that's right yes sir now you come down to denominational churches come on now you better listen cuz you mis interpret me I'm sorry I don't have an hour and a half to explain it I've explained it enough to you right what they taught you in them denominational churches that a baby as a child coming up you come out singing Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost trinities but don't you think you order letters to the Lord I didn't say that now I've explained that so go ahead they were doing the best they could do and that was fine but God one day spoke to you and said come on well that's what we say isn't it right we said oh if God would speak to me like he spoke to Abraham yeah I keep emphasizing it was Abram he talking to right abely making no difference in all of us right right amen when Abraham that's way on over in this journey right y but you see a lot of people hear the voice of God yep they hear it by radio by whatever you know forms are preachers preaching in the pull pit and they make up their mind that they're going to become one of those they go to church and they try to live by a Cod of rules and ethics or forms or whatever you want to call it that's why I Don't Preach like these other preachers sometimes I'll bring in a thought and put it in about you women in your hair and your dresses the men in their clothing and thing but I just put that in every once in a while right where do everybody will know what I stand on if you don't know what I stand on around here you're blind is a bat that's right I remember years ago certain sister sitting here looking at me she something happened to the sister she said well I'll tell you one thing about it brother Dale don't believe that yeah well I think you know what I stand for right amen M and we got a preach about dress and hiring clothes to women has been in the message 10 years 20 years 30 years come on there something wrong with your mentality is it just idol worship that you got right in vain you come to church and you try to pretend to be yeah right come on folks I get back to that that I get in trouble with it but you pry yourself up to go to town well when hubby comes in feel Stiller one you I get in trouble with that that's all right you come tell me it ain't the truth that's right because that's one thing about this old boy plays no jokes or nothing I believe in cleaning up and going to town I believe in that I try to do it but sometimes I'm in a hurry and I don't have time and George found me in one of them that I didn't have no time and I had all kind of a gar B I'll get up and go to town with what clothes I got on if I don't have time I think it's nice to clean up I think it's good to smell good that's right you know what I think it's nice for those things the Bible don't say that cleanness is next to godl this it doesn't say that but that's a good saying you I remember a guy down at work one time he was telling about said in the church they had some people came and said man they stunk and he said everybody got to moveing away and moving away and he said one day I had to say something that I tried to hint to done everything said come up Christmas said we give him a bunch of soap did good he said I finally had to say something well that's you know you ain't got to smell like no bottle of perfume now I'm not wrong I'm trying to say it like it is I'm saying it ought to be nice go to Town's nice dress up going to town sisters but when do you ever dress up when your husband's at home that's right come on see that's the way I preach these others preacher all they want to hammer and hard on you and scream about you and beat you over the head I just say it like it is and just leave it brother randam said if you can't turn around look in the mirror and realize Jesus Christ is looking at you he said there's something wrong with the way you're dressing that's men and women right that's right amen right that's true why you don't see us when we go off with all these people and people will be around you know and everything we were down there with Bill the other day and and we had her clothes on and Bill come out with shorts on that's all right that's not my business right yeah but I don't have to change do no I just myself that where go yep why can't we be there right amen but no listen if you don't get nothing the message today get one thing has something spoke to your heart yes right as an inward person a being a thought and an idea that is so real until it's more real than anything you physically can see with your eyes see that way you know this message is right that's right no matter with them what they try to tear down about brother Brown you know this message is Right y abs amen like brother dick says it wouldn't matter if they found out brother Brown was married 40 times this message has led me to the Lord It's led me to Christ see then I know all them things is wrong they try to bring out that's right man that's right but you see church has anything ever spoken your heart so deep down in there that say nothing can take that out nothing can ever satisfy you what did the man say there in the script he said it's like fire shth in my bones that's right amen that's right like fire he said shut up in my bone that's right that's it something more real than my wife my kids my the church and the people of the world whatever something real right and just walk in that yes I've told you about in my own experience of seeing things even seeing angels and things in the house even seeing the Lord when I was about 11 years old but I put none of that as an experience none of that is my experience of the new birth no I have been able to as the lord gave me to speak sometimes words that literally have come to pass and seen it come to pass but I put none of that as my experience right absolutely cuz Paul said you can do all of these things now let me paraphrase that scripture just a second he says you can do all these things and have not an inward experience yep of something speaking within you that's right is that changing the scripture when it says you have not charity what's charity speaking of Charity is love almighty God there's only one charity there only one God right see the difference in the old and the New Testament those people back there God could speak to their heart and they done Mighty marvelous things because of that voice that was in their heart right but on the day of Pentecost from that time down it's been God in the heart of man right that's right when you receive that new birth and I believe it this way you must first hear the voice of God calling you to Salvation absolutely amen that's my way of saying right he must hear him speak to you y and call you y then he can given you birth to that that he's called you not all of these seeds everybody says you're born with inside of you you know this that of building yeah putting it all on one thing as God called you if he's called you then he can give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes the old test people couldn't get that that's right they could only get the call the leading and if they could do those mighty marvelous things right what should it be under the blood of Jesus Christ amen come on that's right Amen on he said well you spoke to these things but if you go back and listen to the message you'll hear some things that you hav't paid maybe much attention to cuz I believe in God speaking to your heart to calling you I don't believe in me calling you that's right I told you about when Wade came back you've heard the story and I had done told my wife that he was going to be ministering with me in the pull pit and he came to me one day and he said Daddy I want to talk to you I said you don't want to talk to me he said you know what I'm talking about I said yes sir I sure do if you don't want to talk to me well boy that would have been something in the preachers thism my son is called to preach I said run run run son God can't use you if you volunteer run until he runs you down it took him about 6 months he come back and he said Daddy I run h i do I said you're preaching Sunday then whatever his first service Wednesday what see I was glad to announce it then because it was not Daddy called and Mama sent oh that's right and it wouldn't way he got up and went it was God speaking I'm just leaving that with you he's ever spoke to you brother Dale I've never heard a voice I ain't talking about an audible voice yeah right I'm talking about an nword right yes right something that just says turn around right now come on one more time it was Abram that stepped out that's right that's sir not Abraham Abram that stepped out that God spoke to Y in other words if you were tying at like today you would have the new birth would be Abraham yeah it would be in your journey that God spoke to you somewhere told you to turn around have you heard that voice amen 597 in anybody have a need I have found his grace is all complete he
