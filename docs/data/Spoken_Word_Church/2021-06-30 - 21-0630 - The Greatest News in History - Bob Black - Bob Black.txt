you'll just move among us lord we ask this blessing upon your word and upon your people lord tonight in your name amen amen so in luke chapter 24 it says i'm kind of going to start uh down at verse 27 and if you go back and read the whole chapter this is talking about um all of these things happened on the day of the resurrection um and it says and and this is where um the the two cleopas and his friend were walking on the road to emmaus and and jesus kind of you know popped out of the bushes or began to come along along with them began to walk along with them and they didn't they didn't know who he was and it says and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them and all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew nigh under the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went into terry with him and it came to pass as he sat at meat with him he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened us the scriptures you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of your work now uh just kind of y'all y'all know how i like to do is just kind of taking and break down uh a sermon that brother branham preached and the message this afternoon to break down is the greatest news flash in history and um you know i kind of realized one day that it's it's better to just say say what brother branham said and and uh you know there's a lot of things maybe we could add into sermons a lot of times and everything but if you just preach the word there's a power in the word that the uh and i believe that comes from kind of dying out to yourself when you realize that that it doesn't matter so much maybe our opinions and the way things we think we should things should go and and whatnot so i just want to just kind of want to take what brother branham said and just kind of lay it out there and i believe that it will have an effect now brother brown said that that these two men that they began to walk down and the road along the road they were looking around and they uh he said that you know after jesus died and they they uh and and rose rose again they everybody was kind of an expectation for something to happen they were they were looking maybe looking expecting to meet jesus and he and you know you begin to kind of kind of meditate on that expecting coming and expecting everywhere they went people were one wandering and expecting for something to happen i i wonder if that's how we should be when we come into the house of the lord when we go to special services or whatever we sometimes we kind of lose our expectation and we kind of begin to go through the motions but not these they were expecting to meet jesus you know the bible says that he'll appear to those that look for him if you're looking for him then he's going to appear for you in other words if you're just meditating constantly thinking about it and thinking about his word and i believe that's the right way to approach the bible and the scriptures to actually you know go through and just highlight things and just sit there and think about it and meditate on it and before long god will begin to open up things to you he'll begin to reveal to you things that maybe before you stumbled over and tripped over and and wondered it now so they were under that expectation and brother brown said though think about those 40 days that jesus was on earth appearing for 40 days 40 days and all during that time people you know constantly looking is he going to appear here is he going to appear here and and he would show up among 500 and show up among a few disciples and thomas miss and then show up with thomas there and show up here and there show up to peter and and just constantly showing up and i believe that i believe see this message that brother man preached i believe was to open our eyes to the fact that he is here if we'll just if we'll just come expecting that he is here he's not he's not a god of yesterday he's not somebody that's still in the grave but he is actually still alive among us brother abraham said how that every being in the road you might meet with him face to face the resurrected lord jesus at every turn think about that that every turn art say it like this at every church service every sunday morning every sunday evening every wednesday night the every time you turn a corner there might there you might run into the lord jesus not not just some story from ages gone by but the resurrected lord jesus revealing himself in flesh again where you can actually see him so i want to say i want to clarity tonight maybe just come expecting to see and come expecting to see you now come expect it always when you're driving in your car when you're listening to a tape expect to meet him there because it's not just in church when you can really enter into worship but it's when you're in the shower when you're in alone in the car with god when you're sitting under the apple tree or when you're doing your work is when god can come by and speak to you now brother ram said on the road to emmaus one day he said two men were walking along and he said a man stepped out just an ordinary man not dressed any different in priestly robes he was a man just ordinary clothes on there a man that walked he said and then they walked out begin to talk to them said why are you weary now and that's how so many times we'll come across god in our life maybe just somebody come along just speaking to us you see many times god when he appears it's veiled behind badger skins that many times we don't realize that it's actually god talking to you a man behind the pulpit or your pastor clothed in badger skins or of somebody in your family that's speaking the word of god to you but if we'll just realize that that's god appearing to us god given us something to take this journey by something to to conquer we have something to overcome and they said why you're a stranger said jesus of nazareth who he knew to be a prophet of god and expected him to be the king of israel and they killed him and he's dead and he's buried all this trouble has set in and everything looking at circumstances wondering wondering like maybe so many in the message today when pastors are leaving the message and things are things are going right what's what's going on i wonder if he's still alive or if if these are just stories that we heard i wonder if he's still alive but he is still alive and he will manifest himself i believe you know one thing i kind of got to thinking about is you know that the kids have been going this summer as we kind of get out of this pandemic stuff and they started going back to camps and i'm the one at home that kind of sits up and waits for them to get back and when they get back at night you know i'm sitting there and i i want to hear the things that are done i want to hear these stories and they come back and they're not telling about just just kind of going to like maybe you know just like regular we'll say regular church but they're coming back telling about how that they met jesus how that they saw god move how that they had an experience you see that'll excite anybody to know that he's not just a god of history or something that's dead still in the grave but he is alive and that brother brandon said he talked with him all day and they never recognized him he made like he would go on by and they constrained him and kept constraining until finally he went in with him and now sometimes you sometimes you gotta you gotta constrain him a little bit you gotta get a little bit desperate you gotta do like like jacob did and wrestle wrestle with the angel you gotta you gotta want something he said all day all day not knowing who he was now now you think about maybe maybe think about your own life maybe you've been going coming to church your whole life maybe you've been coming to church because your mama and your daddy that's what they did and you come to church because you're you're the people that you're associated with come to church but do you know that jesus christ is alive or are you still looking at it wondering wondering if he's alive after talking with him all day hear it and preach for three years hearing and preach after his resurrection brother brahm said and did not recognize him until he did something just like he did before his crucifixion you see there they were on that road to emmaus and he took them they took him they constrained him in into the door behind the in in the little building there and shut the door and there he did something to prove that he was alive something that he had done before the resurrection and if you read on down in that chapter in the in the book of bikes it talks about something related to the breaking of the bread he broke the bread in the same way that he did before his resurrection now brother brown said it sometimes sometimes it takes the supernatural to make us understand it takes the supernatural to make us understand he said isn't it a strange thing that it takes something on the side of supernatural to make us understand that it's him now maybe this is maybe a little simple message tonight but i just want to declare that this is a supernatural gospel this is not we're not just learning about things like in a reading room and then just kind of sharing with people how much we know but there is actually a living reality to this a supernatural a supernatural god manifesting himself in supernatural ways to a supernatural bride brother brown said there were many who taught hey and now listen this is a this is a quote that stumbles a lot of people all i had quotes that kind of trip people up he said that teaching teaching itself won't do it teaching itself won't do it that sometimes you need you need the supernatural now now let's let's massage that a little bit let's dive into that to see what he might mean when he says that teaching itself won't do that now come on now that you know that stutter trips people up a little bit you begin to wonder now wait a second does he mean that we that we don't need teachers in the faithful ministry that can't be what he means he doesn't mean we don't need teachers in the five full ministry but you see brother branham said there were many who were taught that there was going to be a messiah there were many who were taught that there was going to be a messiah one day but then one day the messiah actually showed up and when the messiah showed up and manifested the supernatural then then it actually makes it real see you can hear about it but when the messiah shows up when he shows up in your life and actually when you when something actually connects when the wires connect and the air the spirit of the living god comes and quickens the word then that takes all the doubt that's what takes all the doubt away listen you can argue over what you've been taught but you can't argue over what's been revealed you can't argue over what's been supernaturally made manifest you see how sometimes sometimes it takes the supernatural to actually make it something that's that's real to you you see the pharisees the pharisees kept all their rules and everything they thought that it was just rules and they thought well we okay now we got a good handle on what the sabbath is and we we wash our pots and our pans and we say how far we make rules for how far you can carry sticks but then jesus came along and he baffled him because he healed somebody on the sabbath he went down to the pool of bethesda and said pick up your cot on the sabbath day and it baffled them why because there was the interpretation of the scripture there was the supernatural made manifest and all of their teaching that they had heard what it manifested there in their sight all what their teaching could not make real you see what about how all of these denominational systems have taught matthew 28 19 and taught what it was and laid down the teaching but then one day a prophet came with a supernatural revelation a supernatural understanding of what that was and shared with us tying it back to what peter preached that the true revelation of matthew 28 19 is acts 2 38 that the name of the father son and holy ghost is jesus christ because the father's got a name and a son has a name and the holy ghost has a name and that name of those offices is jesus christ there's one god that's being manifested in those three offices that's one god in the office of the holy ghost living and dwelling in you and and that supernatural understanding when it's revealed to you you can't argue with it john chapter 6 verse 53 when jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you and i see we can teach this except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you you can teach that except you eat his flesh and get all confused like the catholics do they believe that when they're taking the communion and the wafer that they're actually eating the body of jesus christ but you see a supernatural revelation a supernatural when the supernatural comes it will give the true interpretation of that you see why we've got we've got it takes the supernatural it takes the supernatural to give you that substance that you cannot be shaken from it takes more than teaching teaching itself won't do it teaching lays that foundation it gives you something and then but then it's got to be quickened by the word it was the woman at the well that all her life she had heard that t her father or mother or whoever it was had taught her about one day there's coming a messiah but then she met a man that said that told her about all of her husbands and all the things that were wrong in her life and all the sin in her life and she ran into the city saying come see a man come see the supernatural that has been witnessed to me i've been in touch with the supernatural something that was beyond all of the teaching that i've heard peter and andrew that have been taught by by their father and they've been taught that one day the messiah is coming and then one day they met a man that said cast your ned on the other side of the boat and there they were witness to the supernatural that rose that teaching the life and there in front of them was what they had been taught there in front of them was god manifested in flesh and moses that had been taught by his mama taught that one day you're going to be a deliverer one day you are you're going to be raised up for this purpose and he tried to do it on his own he tried to do it on top of that teaching that he had but the teaching wasn't enough one day he met the pillar of fire and that put that teaching into action down into down he went into egypt and he said let my people go do you realize that's that's the supernatural when he said let my people go that's something that all the teaching couldn't give him something personal brother brother said hey talking about peter he said that man had been taught by his father that when messiah cometh he'll be a prophet and simon was a fisherman but one day when he walked in the presence of jesus christ and he said your name is simon and you are the son of jonas and i'll call you peter from now on he knowed that was the messiah he was a changed man from that day on you gotta get in touch with the supernatural when you get in touch with a supernatural natural it will change your life it will change your life from a cold dead former christian it'll make you know how to worship in order to serve god and live for god it'll change your soul and his attributes are made manifest in you now listen listen think about this now philip in in acts chapter eight he went down to the samaritans now listen how brother but i'm late he he lays this this out that philip taught the samaritans he taught them and then peter came behind to unlock the door now in acts chapter 8 verse 5 to 6 it says then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them and the people with one accord gave heed under those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did you see they believed what philip said they believed what was taught to them they went and were baptized they listened to what he said they were baptized but yet they didn't receive the holy ghost in other words they hadn't yet got in contact with the supernatural the wires hadn't connected yet even though they were taught you see it takes more than just being taught it takes the supernatural and you see in acts chapter 8 verse 14 to 17 it says now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they had received the word of god they had received the teaching they sent unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then lay their hands on them and they receive the holy ghost now brother branham said that peter peter you know what peter did he actually unlock the door to the supernatural to the three groups of people that came off that ark ham sham and japeath he unlocked the holy ghost to the people to the to the jews at pentecost he unlocked the holy ghost to the to the house of cornelius to the gentiles at the house of cornelius and he unlocked there to the samaritans when he came down to the people that had been taught the word and what what is unlocked mean it's preaching the gospel to unlock in a way that you can un-open up your door to realize that it's there for you to realize that god is alive actually present in the building that he's there ready for you if you'll just open up your heart and believe it that it's available for you if you want it if stare now the teaching was there the teaching had already been laid out and he was preaching something that made it accessible to them preaching it in a way that they knew that it was there and it unlocked open the door he gave them the key did jesus say that i give you the keys peter peter had the keys he had the revelation of jesus christ to open up the door to the supernatural to them and you see even though they had heard the teaching even though they had heard phillip go down there they needed the supernatural sometimes it takes somebody with the key to unlock the supernatural now you know brother branham and the oneness of unity he was laying out how that was actually what billy billy graham's problem was his problem was that he would go into a place and he would preach repentance and the people would believe and they would say yes i need to repent but yet they would empty out in other words they would get emptied out but yet there wasn't something to fill them up they needed somebody with the key to open up the door that they could get filled up you see it wasn't enough just for them to hear billy graham say that you need to repent and everything and they they would now let's let's listen to the way brother brown said he said but today is billy graham my beloved brother as he's having the people to dump themselves out with sin he hasn't got the message of filling up again he hasn't got the message of filling up again that's what's the matter you are dumped out but let me humbly speak to you as your brother now listen to that let me humbly speak to you as your brother why because he had a message of feeling filling up he had a message that could feel you do you realize that actually what billy graham did put them in a worse situation because now they were emptied out and they got filled up again with a religious spirit instead of getting filled up with the holy ghost and now they wouldn't go set in their churches and everything and they just ended up being just horri just a horrible situation if you don't get the good man of the house at the door to keep the devil out then then the devil's going to come in and make himself right at home and make you a good religious person sitting in a church ain't filled up with the holy ghost just criticizing everybody else prisoners criticizing the preacher when he's preaching not only those criticizing somebody when they're preaching repentance because all you all you end up with again is a good intellectual person sitting in a church that's been emptied out but ain't been filled up again you see what we need is to be filled up with the holy ghost fill up so that we can recognize what god is doing in this day fill up so that we've got power to overcome now what is the supernatural the supernatural the dictionary says of a manifestation or event attributed attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature in other words in other words it's it's something that you can't understand you can't understand when like like the the story i was sharing with some of the brothers how i want a brother that we know in the message was preaching behind the pulpit and he stepped away for a little bit and and and one of the ministers said i saw i saw your ipad go flipping through it was flipping through and it opened up the table app and it clicked on the sermon and while he was preaching the sermon began to play wow that's beyond scientific understanding that's actually the supernatural at work the supernatural at work is when you're in a church and somebody looks up and says i saw an angel standing over there on the side the supernatural when the preaching of the god of the word is going forth and somebody after the service says i felt a spirit leave me and now i've got liberty that's the super supernatural you can't explain it because something supernatural is happening it's supernatural when you look at a real christian person and they're actually walking and demonstrating patience a temperance when a car pulls out in front of them they don't fly over the animals something's got a hold of them that you can't explain by scientific reasoning of the laws of nature something beyond the realms of the natural man the natural light something's got a hold of them from another world that's why brother brown preached that sermon look into the unseen because we're not looking to what the natural eye can see we're looking beyond we're looking to by faith to something that the natural eye cannot see into the supernatural realm listen that's why that's what we've got pictures of the pillar of fire on our walls because we're believing we're following a supernatural message we're actually you know everybody says well the message message people follow a man we're the only we're actually the only people that don't follow a man everybody else is following their presbyters and their denominational system and whatever the pope says but we're the only ones that actually follow the leading of the spirit and don't put a period behind what we believe because what god shows us today he'll he'll open it up let me tell you when i when i read and i study these messages and then go preach them again in another church or something every time i read it more and more opens up why because we're not bound by what some man says some presbyter or something but the holy ghost our joshua is leading us into the promised land he's taken us to where we need to go listen the pillar of fire proving that the message is true you know i'm i'm not going to call names here but one of the kids here went to was battling out whether the message was true and they went down to one of the louisiana camp and they had the prayer line down there and and battling out whether or not this message was true they came out and looked back at the prayer line and there over the prayer line was the pillar of fire vindicating and proving that this message is true and they swooped over the building and listen now maybe their life wasn't changed then maybe it took a while for something something to actually take a hold but listen we are accompanied by the we're being led by something that's supernatural we're not here just to learn about something but there's actually a god that's in our midst proving his word it's the spirit of god that can move through a bill and get something something that can deliver somebody from a suicidal thought or wanting to cut themselves or slice up their body or destroy themselves something a rushing mighty wind that can rush through a building and deliver sinners and convict sinners i was talking to an evangelist recent well maybe not recently last year so and he was telling me about how he was in his service and he was preaching away and he was at the end of the service it began to die down and he began to talk about how he began to say just by moved by the spirit i believe that god's still dealing with somebody and i just want to wait and wait and he began to linger and after a while after a few minutes somebody just rose up and they said it's me and they begin to shout as me i'm the one that you're talking about you see that's the supernatural dealing with somebody that supernatural can speak to a heart and say you're the one that i'm calling that's what the gospel does that pricks in the heart and calls and draws he's calling for you tonight he's calling he's pulling at you to come to him and give everything that you've got to him listen the word that the word is being preached is the most valuable thing that you'll ever come across in your life there's nothing in this life more valuable than the gospel the supernatural is will fill with the holy ghost you realize the world is actually looking for something genuine something that's something that can only be satisfied and presented by something supernatural the world is looking for a genuine christian the world is looking for the power of god on display the world is looking for a living bible a manifested word and let's say we've got i believe that we've got it we should share it we've got it let's let's put it on display this is a supernatural message revealing a supernatural god to a supernatural people now if we can just get away from thinking that we're just coming to church and do you know when i was up there in mccaseville i was quoting that quote where brother brown said that i think the brother that visited here a little bit a while he mentioned that that 80 percent of the people 80 of christians don't even know why they go to church 80 percent of christians just come to church just to kind of sit around and be seen or or see or because somebody that they know did it but we're coming to church to be changed we're coming to church like brother and i'm saying in perfect strength by perfect weakness because we're broken messed up people that need something we're not coming because we're perfect but we're coming because the perfect one can change us to be like him [Applause] now brother braham said he he never commissioned his church then to go and teach the word he said preach the gospel or manifest the gospel and the gospel came not through word only but through the power and demonstrations of the holy spirit and i know that's tripped up so many people well see we're not supposed to teach the what does that mean you're not supposed to sit down and reason with somebody about what acts 2 38 means and reason what's up just have a good discussion we're not supposed to do any of that we're just supposed to take our brain out and just lay it over to the side and just go through life like a zombie and not reason or anything no that's not what he's saying he's saying what he's saying is listen let's dwell on what what the gospel really is the gospel is actually taking the the word for your day that proves that jesus christ is alive and real and that is what will transform lives you know i i believe that for years it was maybe taught that that before martin luther came on the scene that that maybe they read that that scripture many times in habakkuk and elsewhere in the bible it says the judge shall live by faith and they probably taught it they taught it but one day the supernatural touched the lips of that man and he began to say the just shall live by faith and it took on a new life then because now the supernatural had touched it and became a word for their day to get them out of that denominational that catholic system to bring them out of that to to open up a door out of that out of that age to where they could actually realize what god wanted him to see in that day that the just don't live by trying to work up something that you don't have to do something to be saved but the just shall live by faith you're saved by faith by grace through faith it's the grace of god and then you believe on that grace that he gives you and that's how you're saved so what is the gospel now second peter versus one through through 20 says now knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation not just not just some things that we're we're thinking of coming up with our of our own self for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost as they were moved by the holy ghost now i was reading a quote i don't have it with me so i can't remember what sermon it was in but brother brown was talking about when you're speaking under the holy spirit he said sometimes i'll say things that appear to contradict something that i already said and i'll ask myself am i a hypocrite am i you begin like for example he'll go into a church that's a little bit mortgage and he'll preach liven it up a little bit he'll preach a certain church that's a little bit leaning too much toward frolicking and he'll preach go back to the other direction why because he's balancing everybody up when you preach something under the holy spirit it's it actually brings life to the word it actually it makes it a living word it's not something that will just make you cold and formal but it'll make you live it'll make you live the gospel you're the real gospel when it's preached will actually deliver you from your sins it will actually it'll actually change you it'll actually it'll it'll open up your eyes and make you realize that your eyes were veiled and now you can see things as they truly what truly are now listen how brother brown said it and has the lord spoken only to moses he said the word is the beginning or the forerunner of the gospel so you got to be taught because the word foreruns the gospel his work he said the word goes out and the gospel of the power of the demonstration of god follows the word makes the word manifest so that's what the gospel is it's the manifestation of the word he said that is the gospel that's what the gospel is when the word is actually made visible when it's made real he said so it's not just the rich ritualistic affair but it's absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of jesus christ living among men and that's the faith that i'm trying my best to contend for today that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and his power is unlimited his power is unlimited do you really that'll take the veil off your eyes when you realize that you like you know brother brother said what how foolish it would be for a mouse down in the grainers of egypt to eat sparingly i think well this is going to run out how foolish of us to be to eat sparingly from the word of god to eat sparingly from the master's table because we're at a table of unlimited power listen whatever you whatever you believe you can have it if it conforms to god's word you can have your healing you can have your salvation you can have the salvation of your family you can have the you can you can restore fellowship when it's lost whatever you need if you believe it because the power of god is unlimited you know now listen you say even when i'm preaching this i can kind of just feel that it just you just kind of draw up yeah i know but but what about my situation because why you've been sitting on that situation so long like the man that's been at the pool of bethesda sitting sitting there for so long and then jesus came by when jesus comes by when the supernatural is manifested it makes all the difference if we could just get the veil ripped away from our eyes so that we could see that god is still the same yesterday today and forever he's still the same as he was when he was preaching through brother branham he's still the same he's still the same if you could just believe that whatever you have need of you can still tap into that tree of life and receive it he said in the second coming he said the gospel is not go out and teach them the bible he said that isn't the gospel it said in the scriptures that the gospel didn't come to you just in word only listen because you teach somebody the bible that's great now they know the bible now they begin to kind of get a a humpty in their head i can i can quote more than you and i know more than all that but when you get a touch of the supernatural right it's supernatural he said the gospel that is the word but the letter killeth the spirit giveth life he said now a seed laid here on the puppy here is just a seed until it dies and becomes germatized germatize and dies it'll never do anything so the seed the word here has to be made manifest in order to be of god in order to be of god it's got to be men manifest now now what are you talking about brother bob i'm talking about when moses was taught he went and killed an egyptian and you see that's how the letter killeth that the letter will make people feel just just terrible and beat down on everything when the letter is just a letter but when their spirit is preached then that'll transform the message from from murder from killing it'll transform it and to let my people go and we're going out we're going out and we're being led by the holy spirit we're going out after after the pillar of fire being led by the supernatural with the word of god and the tables as they crossed over the jordan river brotherhood said in the mark of the beast and the seal of god he said in other words to preach the gospel would be to demonstrate the power of the holy spirit paul said the gospel come not in word only but through power manifestations of the holy spirit that's right it has to make the word manifest and if the spirit is in the word the true spirit of god in the word if you abide in me and my word and you ask what you will and it will be done to you amen you see you see what coming to church does it actually begins to line up our mind it begins to transform our minds so that we're thinking right you realize maybe maybe think of it this way the only thing standing between us and the rapture is our lack of understanding the lack of our spiritual understanding so that if the eyes of our oprah's understanding we're open to give you that to bring you the new birth the eyes of your understanding will one day be open to a revelation that you are going to be raptured and you'll step over that's what that's why we go to church because the word of god the quickened word of god actually has power to transform that's why brother brown said god never told a man to labor 30 years and harvest nothing he gave us the open door of word and power and that is what we are supposed to use he said if you're not seeing the results that jesus said you would see it's because you are not preaching the true gospel now to me that's that's not so much pushing down well that's pulling up to realize that if you're preaching the true gospel it's going to have an effect if you're believing the right word it's going to have an effect now it might be a long while while that ox is slogging through but one day you're going to come to the man one day you're going to come to the eagle and the ego will be flying it's going to take off because the spirit comes and rests upon the word brother abraham said amen the success of the church the success of the church lies within the preaching of the gospel of the power of god and the demonstration of the spirit he said that's the church in itself is god's spiritual revelation of his son that's made manifest to you and the power and demonstration of this holy spirit that's that's the success of the church that is the church that's that's if you're not seeing the results you're not preaching that but if you are it's because you're preaching that the everything that we are everything that we do stems from the gospel which is the manifested word for your day proving that jesus christ has raised from the dead that he's not still buried but he's still alive he said go you into all the world and preach the gospel these shines shall follow them that believe a manifestation a manifestation of the presence of the resurrected lord jesus and people who are spiritual conceptions receive it and believe it amen now he said it's the word it's the word turned on the light turns on the mechanics and they become dynamics they are dynamics when the dynamics comes to the mechanic he said it starts the thing rolling that's right take the word if there is one little thing missed up on it it won't start i know if you get your your teaching right get everything situated it's gonna start if you get it all the groundwork do you realize what this message is for us we needed something to connect us to the supernatural and all the denominational teaching won't connect that's why that's why they don't have nothing but coffee shops and why they don't have nothing but people in shorts and dreadlocks preaching behind little glass pulpits and because they've taken the supernatural away but the message of the hour actually puts the supernatural back into the belief back into the church why because the truth is the truth it's the truth to connect you to connect your earth to the supernatural to connect you to another realm and when you connect to pieces then you've got a spark you're going to have something to give a jolt into the church listen you know brother brown he even said he talked about how when the lake talking about laying on of hands when you lay hands on somebody then the spirit of god is actually passing from one to another it's actually something real listen this is not not a good place to testify and not that kind of forum but i i have been a witness to that being in meetings and things where somebody come and lay hands on you and you talk about there's some power behind a real dedicated believer a real dedicated son or daughter of god that puts their hands on you something is actually happening why because there's a supernatural something working in a supernatural realm at place you see we're not just studying about something to know more than somebody else to know more about the other churches and so we can argue and debate about things but we're we're actually getting in touch with god almighty god in touch with the supernatural he said it starts the thing rolling that's right take the word if there's one little thing messed up on it it won't start he said lay aside every weight every ism every creed that the dynamics the holy spirit might flow through the word and vindicate the word that's promised of this day then the great church of god will rise to her feet like a jet propelled plane take off to the skies to meet her master all right my if we could get that a revelation of what he's really saying there then we wouldn't pity patty around with the bible and with the message we wouldn't let just the minister of study it out but we'd actually get serious with god and get on our knees and get to lay our bible open and begin to pour through the scriptures and find out what the message is really about listen i i believe that we should be sold out to the word but god won't that's the kind of person that's going to take a body change somebody that's so sold out to the world that they're going to be in the word all the way they're just going to be eaten and eaten continually they're going to lay aside all the movies they're going to lay aside all the magazines they're going to feast on that word until they actually become the word until their mind is transformed by the word until their body is transformed by the word their character their life everything is transformed by the word because they value they found the pearl of great price they cast everything away until they actually they actually become that thing that they found brother brown said that's exactly right until we do that it won't work that's what about yes sir who will do it who will keep it in this day that we're thinking about he said remember remember brother there's going to be a lot of remembering there's going to be a lot of remembering on the day of judgment looking back and remembering the sermons that are preached to the things that we're saying remember but now it's time to remember the words of encouragement amen listen we're we're not hearing the words of man but we're hearing something that echoed straight from calvary two thousand years ago it's echoing down into the hearts of believers that will believe what was done for them two thousand years ago and all the things that were preached by the son of man 1 23 says turn you at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit upon you how is he going to pour out his spirit upon you i will make my words known unto you is what the scripture says that's how he pours a spirit out by the word he lays the connector out the words and then that provides an avenue for the spirit to move in john chapter 6 verse 63 it says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life why that because it's not something that's just taught but that is the gospel the gospel has life in it life to change and that's what brother and i said the sign of the resurrection confirms the word he said he had there there as though they went down on the road to emmaus and went down into that little little building there something was done the supernatural was made evident now now whatever you believe about what was happening there had to be something something to identify the supernatural working of christ that he did before the resurrect before before he died on the cross to show that he was still alive brother robert said and it came to pass as he set at meat with him he took bread and blessed it and break it and cave to them gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and he said then you see it takes the accompanying of the sign of resurrection to confirm the word to make jesus positive known to the people and what what's the sign of the erection the resurrection i i believe we all we're coming to the point where we identify the sign of the resurrection with the sign of the son of man which is god revealing himself back in flesh again not just moving through the service heaven church ages and in the form of the manifestation the office of the son of god part word able to quicken part word but now with the full word laid bare before us the fool if you've got the word it allows the spirit to move right so if you've got the full word it allows the full spirit of god to be manifested in the hearts and lives of the church the full the full word which will resurrect you from your dead denominational ideas from your old carnal way of looking actually brings to pass it actually makes visible the sign of the resurrection the sign of the resurrection to bring the dead back from life the sign of the resurrection to bring life into the church to put life into you which is why brother brown quoted so often mark 16 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues because where god is in the midst you're going to have the sign of the resurrection it's unavoidable where the true word is preaching you're going to have healings you're going to have thing when when trouble arises afflictions arise god is there to meet every need meet every affliction and brother said now he appears he appears to the elected believer he didn't appear to no one but his elected church he only appears to believers now today he still only appears to his elected church there were many who taught of messiah in those days and there were many who looked for a coming messiah but he had a church that was elected he had a church just like those two little individual cleopas and his friend that he he appeared to them he didn't go brother braham said he said he never appeared to caiaphas or the orthodox church he doesn't show himself to those that have have died all those organizational systems that have died and now they're just called up and just singing songs in a choir with lipstick and and going out to the beach dressing dressing like the world and now you can't tell any difference between the world and what the denominational systems have become because the supernatural is not made manifest in them anymore all they all they have become as lodges of coffee drinkers and and and people that just maybe tell tell maybe because some good teaching but the supernatural is not not there to make manifest that christ is still alive he said there were many who looked for a coming messiah but he had a church that he was elected and if he was here today he would do just the same as he did then appear to the elected believer he said he never appears to the unbeliever he said i've always told you that god is infinite and cannot change and if that was his attitude towards the world then after his resurrection it's the same thing today and jesus witnessed the same thing by saying as it was in the days of sodom and the days of sodom when he manifested himself came in flesh to abraham sitting there looking over at sodom and gomorrah as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when he manifests manifests the sign of the resurrection to the little group of elected believers to the little elected church that have the word which makes way for the spirit excuse me he said after the resurrection he never appeared to caiaphas the elected group is what saw god manifested in the flesh death couldn't hold him the sign of the resurrection and he said he has come in the form of the holy spirit to the elected church and we are to take him to unbelievers we're the ones that's to let his life shine through us that others might believe as us christ in the church that shines forth his presence to make him visible to all you know that that makes the message a positive gospel it makes a positive thing that to know that you've got something that you can give to other people that's really what i when i give up the behind the poop when i meditate on these things i i don't want to preach a gospel that will take but i want to preach a gospel that will give we were sharing with some people recently about how that's really what i believe a ministry is is like a candle that you you once you light it it gives itself up so that it can give a light to other people that's what not just a minister but that's what a christian is somebody that's on fire for god that that really gives their gifts gives himself up heals himself up so that other people can have light to see by listen jesus taught that we don't put a bushel over a light we don't hide our light but we take that light into our workplace and into our into our church and we give something that other people can benefit from i i i texted brother wade a little quote uh earlier that week where where brother brown was talking about listen all the other denominations everybody else in the world has entertainment they've got all their soup suppers and all the different things so we don't we're not here to give people soup suppers and entertainment and and ministers that know really how to entertain and slickers and things that can entertain somebody because the world's got all the entertainment they specialize in that but we got something that they don't have we got the light of the word we got the light of the gospel that's what we're doing here is to give something that they ain't got you you realize that's what a lot of young people they get that pull of things out in the world they get pulled by stuff that's going on in the world but if if they can realize that they can get something to hear that they can't get out there it'll change it'll change something he said we're the ones that's to let his life shine us through that others might believe it's us christ in the church that shines forth his presence to make him visible to all so therefore when he shines himself forth through the lives of his elected believers those who are elected to eternal life receive him but admire you to think that the light of god is in the believer so much that you can actually give eternal life to somebody else by sharing that light that is in you you can actually speak words of encouragement and life to give eternal life to somebody else he said he manifested himself to his called out an elected church he does the same thing to the church today to manifest himself through his beings us the church called out church and that is the greatest news flash in history that's the greatest news story that could ever be it's greater than what the president's doing it's greater than any kind of titanic sinking or anything that's ever happened in history it's greater than alexander the great conqueror in the world it's greater than anything that you can pull out at the library that god is still alive and he's moving and showing himself in the lives of his people and the lives of his church brother abraham said our message is truly the greatest news flash that history's ever known he said we buried him dead but he's up and alive again he was dead when we buried him and now he's alive forevermore it's truly the facts he is not dead but he's alive forevermore my that how that should stir the heart of a believer to know that this power that has been given into the church power power to overcome all that depression power to overcome all that worldliness power to overcome the way that you used to live power to be a real christian hitting it a joy to be a christian he said it makes a headline in the heart of the believer when he sees it and recognizes it thrills him above everything that could be ever done it throws a headline that flashes everything else of the world dead and he said if you say if you say you are a believer and those signs does not follow you if you say you are a believer and those signs to prove that the resurrection is real that he really has resurrected he said then you have you either have told something wrong or say that he said something wrong that's a strong statement now that's a strong statement when you come to a problem in your life a place of contention in your life and you realize that maybe you're not looking at the word in the right way maybe you haven't been in touch with the supernatural maybe so far it's just been taught to you but when you let god get a hold of you and quicken that word and make it rise up off of the pages then you'll be able to tell the doctor i'm healed then you'll be able to tell the people that say things about you at work i met the master something's been changed in my life because brother adam said the word will produce these signs shall follow the believer in my name they shall cast out devils speak with new tongues if they if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover those are strong words but these are promises of god that we can lay at his feet and claim it when we have need of something signs of that type fall as the believer so brother brown said come and see like like earlier on in that chapter there we were reading how the angel said come and see where he laid come and see now brother let's let's pay close attention to how brother brown lays this that we got something behind us something with us and something force going on before he said that was that was what he told the women that the angel that morning at the grave come and see where he was laid he ain't there now now brother brown said if he ain't there he's got to be somewhere so we got to find out where he is now if he ain't there if he ain't stealing the grave then where is he is he in the methodist church is he in the baptist church is he with the presbyterian i know this is maybe strong talk a little bit but let's well you got to find out where he is because if you really if your heart's really in it and you really want to know where christ is where he's at come and see where he was laid but he's not there no more now isn't that what philip told nathanael come and see if nathan was like can any good thing come out of nazareth come and see come come and see what come and see what the sign of the resurrection the sign of what you've been taught may manifest before your eyes so you can see it and then and brother brother said the angel said come and see where he was laid then go tell his disciples that i'll meet you in galilee tell who his bewildered disciples and he said they were certainly bewildered they didn't know what to do they wanted to go back to catching fishes you see what brother brown said catching fishes was he said we got to really watch what kind of a meeting we cooperate with catching fish is to be concerned being concerned about everything else except where the sign of the resurrection is being concerned about who's who's internet now this is what brother brown said being concerned about who's going to other churches and who's going who's leaving and going over here and this is all this kind of stuff who's being concerned about churches swapping one person from one to the other that's what that's what the denominational system is worried about we lost this one over to the baptist church we lost this one to the presbyterian let's see how many we can get to flock to our church so that we can build numbers god's not always in numbers god is where his word is he said we got to really watch what kind of a meeting we cooperate with the disparate district superintendent will turn us out if we go down to such and such a meeting the pastor will turn us out the bishop will do something to us catching fish as you see catches concerned about catching fishes the bishop will do something to us so the church will excommunicate us oh we're so busy watching our members to see that they don't go to no other church or have anything else to do but just a little click you see how many times brother brown was preaching on former little clique when you got your little click then you're watching that and you're instead of watching the word you're watching one another and watching what each of you do when you you got your little click where you got a little intellectual idea maybe what you think should be done and you start criticizing pointing fingers at one another but he said if we'll just he said we're so busy took up with so many different things the church has got so much to do and so busy about this and that we haven't got time to look into these things what things where the resurrected sign of the son of man is where is he at if he's not in the grave where is he he said why not take a little time to study it out sit down before him and come let us reason together they had trusted that he was the messiah and here he was dead and they didn't know what to do now go tell his bewildered church that i am alive and i'll go before him he said he said they they became comforted by a past experience listen there's some real nuggets here y'all y'all try to stay awake hang on with me go ahead they became comforted by a past experience maybe remembering all the times that they had crossed the shore of galilee and he came walking on the water in the middle of the storm and raising the dead and doing all those things and that was a comfort to them now listen listen to what brother brahman said a comfort to the church is now that we we base our experience we base everything on acts 2 and 4. now that sounds like something that would be good to base your experience on daddy he said he said the church today is a great deal that way even to the pentecostals trying to satisfy themselves with acts 2 4 some past experience but all that message of the living god still lives today why are you bewildered i go before you i'm not dead i'm alive what's acts two and four you might not be able to remember but acts two and four says they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as a spirit gave their mothers now isn't that how a lot of christians do today they come and sit in the church and they look back to when they were baptized and filled with the holy ghost that's great that's what the pentecostals did that was that's what brother brown said when he preached where pentecost failed that they were fine with being born again and then they just stopped that that was good enough and they look back to that past experience and that's good enough and that's where you always mess up that's where you that's where you get in trouble he said 40 years later here we find ourselves still acts 2 and 4. god might come in with something else with some more of his blessings and they say glory to god we didn't have that hallelujah we believe acts 2 and 4. here our forefathers organize this if they don't come up to this what's he talking about he said the sign of the resurrection is moving on moving on to more of the word to allow more of the spirit to come in more more working and you get so tied up maybe with looking back at something that now how many times people will testify i remember 20 years ago god did something well that's true which is great we love testimony i remember 20 years ago i saw god moving and do something in somebody's life but what about now what's he doing for you now i want to hear a current present reality of god actually moving in your life because he's not a god of the past but you know brother brahma even said that's why so many times we look back we like to look back and go to renfroe valley we like to go we like to go up to dollywood maybe and where they got old iron skillets and stuff because we like there's something within you to look back and he said there's a desire to look back to the original word and that's actually why you like going back to renfro valley and stuff you like going you want to go back to the way that things used to be a simpler time because there's something in you to long for the original word for the way that god originally put everything in place he said that's all right acts 2 4 is part of it but the thing of it is he said one day two years he said rise you've been on this mountain for 40 years turn north across jordan yawn to the separation for there's more than this mountain for you there's more than acts 2 4 for you every promise in the book belongs to the church and god's waiting for his church to rise and receive it so he's going before us now we're doing all right with the time hold on hang on now in matthew 28 verses 5 to 7 it says the angel talking to him and he said to mary he's not here for he's risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay he's risen from the tomb he was alive among them and he was going before them he was going before them to lead them brother brown said to a certain designation and the designation is the action of choosing a place for a special purpose or giving it a special status and the designation that we're marching toward is a change of the body that's why in first thessalonians he quoted that then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord and the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words comfort one another with the promise that we're going to a designation a special place reserved that god is leading us onto by by his resurrected power that he's not dead he's somewhere he's somewhere he's actually in in the church brotherhood said now the message is he goes before us he goes before us he's not in a tomb behind us he's before us making a way we are to fallen not to look back to the tomb but to look forward to where he's leading for he's our leader we're to look we're to follow him not look back to the tombs trying to find where i put that in my news he said he said cleopas and his friend met the resurrected christ he said oh after they found out the truth that he was resurrected because they'd seen him keep his word and fulfill it and do exactly like he did before he was crucified they hot-footed it across the country i imagine they were just hitting every four or five yards they were in a hurry because they they met they resurrected christ they saw him fulfilling his word he said they wanted to tell the rest of them truly the lord is risen indeed they had something in their hearts and he said brother brown said they looked to jesus only when they heard that jesus had raised from the dead and appeared among them like that they didn't stand and look at one another and that what somebody i was someone was actually telling me the other day that the reason why somebody they knew had left the message was because they got to looking at people and they got to looking at people not unable to overcome and you see you're going to have that you're going to you're going to have people that just can't quite break through you're gonna and that problem is when you begin to look at other people look at other ministers and things look at look at if you get your eyes right if you get your eyes on the word you'll begin to realize maybe that things maybe that you heard around the message around the denominational ideas aren't the way that it really is keep your eyes on christ don't look for gimmicks or secrets just or look for somebody to rise up but just keep your eyes right on the word he said they've seen his scars they've seen his power they've seen him do the miracles that he did before he was dead and they know that it was their living god and they didn't look to one another neither did they ask anybody to look to them they just said look at god look at look at christ look at his word he said don't look towards those poor mournful garlic eaters back there back in the wilderness one of the flesh pots of egypt don't look at don't look at other sinners that are around the message people that haven't overcome don't look at somebody that hadn't broke through that's still wearing shorts and dresses and painted lips these are his words and cutting their hair and denying the power of god let them alone he said don't look back to them don't pay any attention to them we look to jesus we look to joshua who's leading us on amen amen now brother rahm said remembering this that we have something behind us and he quoted the scripture that where jesus said all power in heavens and earth is given unto me now you see what a promise that is if all power in heaven and earth is given to him and he's living inside of you then now you got something to back you up that's that's actually that's actually what when i when i when i first started ministry yeah you can applaud that when i when i first started ministering somebody kind of gave me a little word of encouragement they said you know when you get up behind the pooping it's like you're at the tip of a spear and you got all heaven behind you and you in other words you got some backup now now listen that's that's how every christian is not just a minister you you got some backup when you when things begin to fall apart in your life you got back up that you can fall back on you that's many times our problem is we when things begin to fall apart we want to get our hands all over and we want to try to fix it but if you'll just come to a place where you realize that you got some backup that could do things that you can't do because he said all power is given unto me all power all power that means all the power you ain't never met anybody with that kind of power that can that can meet every need that you've got that can satisfy every every gap in your life close up every wound he said to every promise that he made because all power is given unto him something to back us up so that means that there's somebody behind us something in us and something before us somebody behind us to back us up somebody with us and somebody leading he's something leading us on where to go to the designation to go to the designated place of body change but that's what brotherhood said he was he is and shall come the same jesus that was is the same jesus tonight and the same jesus that shall come the same yesterday today and forever come believe and go and some tell somebody about it he said his life what he was to us is his back life his life what he was to us is his back life and this is such a profound statement hang on with me just while i quote a few more things he said he gave us what he was so that we would not be deceived in what he is today amen he gave us now what he was so that you would not be deceived so you would be able to recognize christ resurrected in your midst that's why he said don't take anybody's word for it take god's word for it amen amen and brother said he stayed with the message from the father he stayed with the scriptures he's saying that's how cleopas and his friend were able to recognize him were able to discern that he was true because he stayed with the scriptures he stayed with the scriptures as not it written in your scriptures no matter what they wanted to see and what they wanted to do they wanted him to raise up this one and do that one he said i do what the father shows me to do i do nothing in myself but what i see the father doing at first that's why he's the same today he appeared to us yesterday and proved what he was behind us that he might be what's in us and a substitutionary thought in our mind of what he will be in other words that you've got in your mind that you are going to take a body change he said if it's this glorious when he comes down among us now what will it be when we have a body like his then we see we got something in the back we got some back up going before us going on before us to prepare a place for us he's gone he is he was he see what we was we look back and see what he was so we see what he is today and i'm gonna close on that note the musicians can come forward so you see what we've got the greatest news flash in history to declare that he's not dead we have not believed just some teachings of man that cannot accomplish something they cannot deliver they cannot set the captive free but we've actually received a message of the supernatural we received a supernatural message declaring that he is not dead but he is alive glory he said beyond a shadow of doubt you're not dead but you're alive forevermore the great conqueror not dead but alive what a what a message to declare amen let's stand to your feet let's just worship the lord a little bit can we can we say he is here hallelujah [Music] here holy holy i will bless his name [Music] is [Music] he's not back there somewhere he's here he's a prison helping time on me [Music] whatever you have need of you can touch him just like that woman that reached out and touched the hem of his garment because he's here to meet every need bless his name
