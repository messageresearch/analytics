========================================

thank you man God bless you Saints on this dreary rainy morning it's good to see you out with the time change might have a few stranglers but that's all right I was a I was working yesterday in the in the garage painting and listening to spoken word as the Original Seed and uh just having a good time and kept running back into the house to write notes but that's why I I got paint on my hands so if you see me today that's why my hands aren't dirty I just I couldn't get it off but um you know I was thinking about how it's a little bit uh the time changed and everything it's a little bit might be a little bit hard to stay away today but um brother random was you'd go back and listen to the spoken word as original see you when brother Ram was preaching that after people had sat for hours and he kept asking the people are y'all so y'all still okay and sometimes sometimes you know it's just a little bit hard but we we just keep pressing on so I'm gonna read this little quote and then we'll read our scripture and just kind of go into the study this morning the brother ramble said in the questions and answers on Hebrews he said there was no Bible speaking of of able there was no Bible wrote then but God revealed to him that it wasn't fruit that brought us out of the Garden of Eden it wasn't apples that Adam and Eve ate it was absolutely sexual things that had separated them and divided them and knowing that they become mortal so you think about that knowing that they become mortal and through the blood of Adam and through the blood of the serpent that had started this Abel by divine revelation went and got a lamb and offered it and God said that's it so we'll read our scripture let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning there's no place I'd rather be this morning with all the all the rain and all the all the clouds then in church this morning sitting together with your Saints Lord and I pray God that you as we just study these things out Lord that you'll give us understanding Lord that you'll help us to understand the mystery of these things and granted Lord that you'll just be where brother Wade as he's preparing the Lord to help us Lord to have the right attitude this morning and this afternoon to receive what you've got in store for us today we ask it in your name amen so in verse 4 of Hebrews chapter 11 it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than gain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yes speaketh now we know as we've been studying this script these this this chapter out that the only way you can you can be acceptable to God that you can make God happy will say it like that is by Faith by Revelation in his word and man like like we kind of laid the foundation as we were going through the book of Hebrews that Paul's trying to get us to impressed in our minds that God has given us his promises and the god it cannot lie made the promise and all these things that God spoke to us so let's let's uh let's trust God and really the whole the whole doctrine of serpent seed and all these things are it's really about love do you love God enough to just have confidence in him to stay with what he said or are you going to start let wondering eyes look at look at the LIE of the devil so uh God's going to have a bride in this age that stays so true to him until she just becomes one with him until she's not not even one word off right well you know you sometimes we you meditate on that you think it's it's almost beyond your reach no God God Made A Way by sending us the prophet to rest if you go back and listen to the spoken word as Original Seed brother Brahman said at the end of that he said it looks like it looks like I get the people into a place where it's it's uh you know everything's just messed up all the doctrine's messed up but nobody's preaching right and all these kind of things but God gave a promise that I will restore I'm gonna get off my notes I'm gonna try to stay on track so in wisdom versus faith brother and said by faith Abel saw the Revelation the vision and brought a living running blood because life was in the blood and I got a little a little B over there pollinating flowers because they were talking about life life is in the stem of the flower and it's botany life which has no feeling I was in hopes that would soak in Abel by faith see he's comparing bot to plant life and animal life the reason why why Abel brought a lamb because he couldn't bring plants like like uh Kane did but but an animal's got some feeling with it it's got It's it's something that we can be identified with Able by faith staying with the word by faith not by wisdom by faith he's saying that it was blood the blood cell comes from the male the man has the blood cell the hemoglobin is the blood comes through the male and Adam knew that it wasn't apples and peaches and potatoes or whatever it was that brought them out of the Garden of Eden that caused the sin it was blood and he offered blood back and uh I don't we I don't know if we got any kids this morning I'm trying to speak with discretion most of the kids should be in Sunday school so anyway y'all can read the words on the uh by faith he done it not by wisdom how was a man through wisdom going to understand it when the whole Bible and the whole Church of God is built upon divine revelation by faith now you know it's a topic that you got to be a little bit Frank with and I was thinking well you know brother Brandon preached it brother Brown preached these words and there were people sitting in there a mixed multitude and whatever so it's it's it's it's a Doctrine that's got to be shared so anyway anyway we're gonna we're gonna Forge ahead here is the light Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever forsake your Creeds and believe this word this is the truth the word is truth Jesus said my word our spirit my word is life how are you going to receive life when you reject life how are you going to take in a Dogma which is death and a Word of Life turn out the word of life to take death how are you going to accept the two at the same time you can't do it let every man's word be a lie and every Dogma a lie God's word is the truth now now what's he talking about as we kind of laid the foundation last time but it all starts in the womb of your mind you listen to a lie of the devil and of course that's that's the greatest battle ever fought the Battle it out is it true or not when that when when somebody says something to you and and you have to you have to work out is it does it match up with God's word or not because God's word is a thing that we hang all of our hopes and everything on it's if it's not God's word we've got to throw it away and the spoken word is the Original Seed he said now let's go back now and pick up again and come down for something you remember what last Sunday's service was the gate to the soul now there is a womb of the physical there's a womb for the spirit did you believe that there's a spiritual womb and a physical womb and the mind is the womb to the spirit and we cover these scriptures last time that Paul told Timothy consider what I say and the Lord give the understanding in all things and in Luke chapter 8 we know the parable the parable is the seed the seed is the word of God and in the mark of the beast he said now what happens the heart is a womb and Faith cometh by open ear that's not been sealed by theology Faith cometh by hearing to hear the word comes into the mind you make up your mind about it is that right could that be right well the Bible said so I believe it down into the heart it goes then it's a womb oh you think about that now that as you receive in the word that you you hold it in your in your heart hold it you think about it and you meditate on it and you begin you begin to as you meditate on it you you're aligning yourself with the word and you say well that's it's it that's what the Bible says that's what the scripture says it says that I can be healed it says that I can be it says there's a promise for the Holy Ghost and you begin to believe that and something begins like you're you're it's it's a womb it begins to develop and begins to grow and mature until finally it's birth that's that's how you get a new birth you you receive that word in the womb of your heart and you just keep hanging on to it and sooner or later now what are we talking about what happened in the garden that Eve received that lie and just you can receive what you receive that the LIE of the devil or the truth of the word of God and you either one of those you hang on to it it's going to produce so how that's why that's how that that baby that that that that uh that Eve ended up holding in her arms that's how it was produced because she received the LIE of the devil and the mark of the beast he said then the then the male sex we are the bride the woman the seed goes into the church then the male sex which is the blood cell the blood of Christ is applied and in the blood comes a germ of life that goes into the seed and brings forth a newborn baby crying Abba Father Abba Father my God my God why did I ever do those things my god there you are and the spoken word is the Original Seed he said that's how adultery is committed spiritually and I got a little girl looking at grabbing cookies she's like you you doing something that you know you ought not to do it's about knowing better by the word of God by the Intercourse of the Mind take in a lie of the devil against the word of God that's exactly what Eve done with a spiritual intercourse first that come by believing Satan's life into the womb or for mine that polluted her soul set death in the soul then the next then the natural act taking place and that's the only way that a woman ever and can commit adultery against her husband is to first let some man talk her into it and then receive another man that's not her husband then she's committed adultery and the spoken word is the Original Seed again brother Brown said and win the church today let's call themselves Pentecostal call themselves Baptists whatever they want to when they hybrid this word with Dogma it produces a dead child and she can't have no life in her oh oh what a powerful quote that is to think you say you were looking the Bible and you say well this is how to be baptized and then you mix something else with it then well you you're going to be you you can't produce nothing you say that the promise of the Holy Ghost is for you and then you throw in some other things well because of your mom and daddy wasn't married you can't receive the new birth or something something strange like that then all of a sudden you're you how are you going to have faith on that you mix something in there and you you it just destroys your your confidence but if you just look straight to the word and say if there's a promise laying there I can have it then you hold it in the womb of your of your mind and begin just begin to meditate on that and it's going to produce God said I'll throw her in a bed of worldliness and kill her children God said so in Revelation how many knows that's true he said oh you can't make the word lies the truth and in the spoken word is the Original Seed again he said so Jehovah's bride went and what did she do she brought forth a bunch of illegitimates again is that right we know it's the truth even had to be taken away by King Nebuchadnezzar and so forth Christ's bride has done the same what's the matter can't wait just can't wait oh you see why he keeps hammering that About Eve couldn't wait she had she wanted to get sometimes you know oh you know you've seen that all around the message somebody wants to know more than everybody else somebody wants to have a greater Revelation and so instead of just waiting on God for that they jump to it and then they get off they get off kilter and go off into something strange and that's that's exactly what Eve did she just couldn't wait for God to come on the scene and reveal it to reveal interpret his word and show how the word was going to be made manifest and prove the word but she jumped she jumped the gun they've got a manufacture something they can't wait for the Holy Spirit to come and get into the church oh you see how this happened in so many people's lives too they instead of waiting they they want to they want to manufacture something and be a be a fake believer you see if you jump and you and you can't wait then all of a sudden you're just a religious uh person going to church you got uh trying to go through the motions and appear outwardly like you're like you're genuine because you couldn't wait now you're trying to manufacture and try to force it but if you'll just wait God will give something genuine if you'll just wait uh he said if it had stayed the way it was back Yonder 100 years ago or 50 years ago when Pentecost first started out on this Latter day when the world began to be preached if it had stayed like that she probably wouldn't have have had wouldn't had over 50 members today that's right but they would be Blood Washed they'd have the power of God in them the world will be shaken under her tremendous impact of the word flesh being spoken word by word but today why he's talking to the Pentecostal Church why it's a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol that's right just become nonsense a laughing block a disgrace to the world disgrace to God why because they couldn't wait to wait on the just wait if you if you want if you're seeking the new birth if you're seeking any promise of God just wait wait on the Lord and try to try to jump jump forward and manufacture just wait and be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart weight I say on the Lord is what David said in Psalms be still and know that I am God that's what we've got inscribed over the little uh wood there above our heads just just just be still and wait and just just let the word begin to mature in the womb of your mind until it produces just wait on him be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the earth if you'll wait and let it now if we just want to summarize some of the things that we've been kind of studying these are my notes on the left and then the things that brother Ram said on the right that when God promises something and you don't understand it just wait on him to bring the true interpretation because that's how so many people have gotten off the track is they try to oh well I I don't understand this so I'm just going to jump and we're gonna all of a sudden well now now we're we're in the Millennium I've been seeing that on Facebook all the time and it just if we're in the Millennium where's brother Brown at if we're in the Millennium I want to talk to the Saints I want to be able to if we're in the Millennium where's the where's the temple that the Jews are supposed to build and all the you know it just everything don't add up but but see you just it's because we don't they people don't we don't you know all of us all of us are guilty in some form or another we're just not waiting wait on the Lord and he'll bring the true interpretation failing to wait on God Satan is there to deceive just like Eve if you if you fail to wait you and you jump me try to try to try to get that with I'm going after wisdom I'm gonna I'm gonna be I want to know more than the next person I want to if you fail to wait on God Satan is right there ready to deceive you and what in your Pursuit yeah you want to know you want to know thing we all are here because we want to know but let's let's wait on God because he'll reveal it in his time the word of God is a seed that incubated if it's incubated in a believing mind it's going to bring forth life and Satan's lie when incubated in a doubting mind is going to bring forth a death now that's that's uh if you really think about that that's that'll answer a lot of questions and brother Adam said what is it the mind is the womb for the spirit what to take in or let out that's how they commit adultery is taking let some Satan devil Spirit putting them something against the word of God then she's committed adultery Eve received listen to this wrong seed word Satan's lie against Jehovah's work and the results was death and then again in another place he said when the Bride of Jesus Christ lets man-made Creeds and dog must take the place of the word of God she is committing adultery the spoken word is the Original Seed again he said now Jehovah had a bride once Adam had a bride Jesus had a bride Jehovah had a bride you know that he had to put her away she'd become a so he put her away that's exactly what he said she become a a prostitute it's interesting go you go back and listen to brother Ramon the spoken word is the Original Seed and it's like everybody just kind of draws back when he starts speaking Frank and I I I I kind of got I wanted to get up I wanted to be in that congregation and just encourage you preach it because you can tell everybody everybody's you know oh I don't know she become a prostitute what caused her to do that I wish we had time to read it I may get to some of it after a while right now it was in the time of Samuel when Israel had a king a God and she was a virgin she was going to produce something now look brother Ramos he's laying out for us how how how you can tell if the church or if a person is going off into spiritual adultery because what they do and instead of looking at the word they start looking at something else like Israel Israel had a promise of God and instead of looking at what they had that God had given them leadership and his spiritual leadership they started looking at something like well I'd rather be like that over there as soon as soon as uh a a young man or a young lady or somebody in the church soon as they start looking off at the world and say well I want to be like that oh that's that's dangerous territory God has given you the ability to live a holy Christian Life and and you start looking out well I I think I'd like to I wish I could do my hair like them I wish I could I wish I could put earrings in my ears and stuff and that's that's going off into that's exactly dangerous to territory he said he said she began to look around and see the other nations had Kings sure she wanted to be like the rest of them and he said you backwashed Pentecost that's exactly what you done that's a picture of what I got here that that that this is a Pentecostal church but now where God at one point wanted the Pentecostals to be uh the the the light of where he could he can manifest his power in in their services and speaking in tongues and moving to the spirit and God manifesting and now has turned into a big show like a circus almost where you come in and there's smoke machines and lice and glass pulpits and all of that kind of stuff but it's so different but why because they fail to wait on God and they ran and and and rushed and tried to manufacture something and looking off at the world to see if they could do something do something else see that where it all goes back to what they were talking about Cain and Abel Abel was based his his approach to God was based on a revelation and Cain was based on just intellectual understanding trying to manufacture something and not not being Wheeling to take God's provided away and the mark of the beast brother Brown said your heart is a wound you know what I'm speaking of women and men your heart as a womb and the womb holds the seed and the seed is the gospel now the seed alone in his heart no matter how many tomatoes you set under no matter how great your pasture is and how much you've read the Bible it'll never take life until the germ of life has come to it a woman's seed is a wonderful thing it's the building of a body but it has no life it can't it's impossible it has no life to begin with so no matter how much you know the Bible and how well it is in your heart you're still a sinner I'm trying to I hope these slides are in the right order I think that's kind of got a little bit older but anyway a baby's gonna grow in the womb and it's going to come forth so in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said this was both physical and spiritual with Eve both physical and spiritual mix mix into the the truth the truth and error mixing it up in the spiritual and the physical first and any time he said I told you and asked you this morning sisters to forgive me so I can mention that anytime that a woman takes the wrong step I'm talking about Crocs in the bride now but anytime a woman takes a wrong step she has to First receive it in her mind right some Slicker has to persuade her and she listens to it against her own better judgment then the ACT is committed so first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind and in the womb of her mind she doubted God's word then come the actual act and there's where you get you get finally there comes little babies and brother said whenever there's a Revival it always produces twins that's a rude remark but it's true when there was a birth out of from Isaac and Rebecca It produced twins when the world was created It produced twins two trees and when Kane and Abel were born It produced two it when Ishmael and Isaac was born they produced two and when Esau and Jacob was born It produced two one of them were natural one of them of the Earth the other one's Supernatural and one looked at the natural intellectual the other one walked by the spirit it's always been that way now we got we just got five more minutes I'm just gonna read a few more quotes before we close brother I'm sitting in the Ephesian Church Ace he said now though the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she's an adulteress is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true and Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law the word can't change now he's explaining where where why we believe that in Adam all die the word can't change Adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself he would not let her go so Eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold the human race into sin that he might have Eve or he loved her and those and so those two sons were born sons that will be the fathers of the human race that was even now polluted now you think about you think about the situation just if we could you remember just meditate on the story this story is so rich think about the situation that Adam was in that he that even come out of his side she was part of him she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and spirit of his Spirit the same and he and he's looking at her and she's made this she's made this mistake and now he's he's like he's he's he wants to be able to go and and Redeemer but it's just not in him it was in Christ it's in Christ to go out and and take on our sin and die on the cross and redeem us back to himself but it wasn't in him so it's like Adam Adam tried to do it and he and he got stuck in the mud he got he's got covered in the filth and couldn't get back So Adam he knew going into it he knew the situation that was going to result from him going and and go going out with Eve he knew the predicament that it was going to put the human race in he knew that it was gonna it what was gonna happen and he went and did it now look where brother I'm said in a spoken word is the Original Seed she got in a hurry and what did she do she crossed her seed she mingled it with the serpent seat and what when she did she brought on what did she bring she brought a child of death now see Adam knew this was going to happen a child that she perverted every child after that now now these are some weighty quotes because you start realizing that this is maybe different than a lot of people in the message believe they uh well let's let's just read the quotes he said what was that what was the seed of the serpent adultery you follow it adultery with Eve what happened to that what brought that forth and adultery another synonym for that is infidelity infidelity is the breaking of a promise in James chapter 4 and we will we'll close on this maybe James Chad from when it's come Wars and fighting is among you come they not hints even of your lusts that war and your members ye lust and have not you killed and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and War yet you have not because you ask not ye ask and receive not because you ask a miss that ye may consume it upon your lusts he's talking about lust now the adulterers and adulteresses know you not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God and brother Brown said in the programian church age he said and what is it spoke of here in the church the spiritual adultery spiritual adulteries when you're you profess to be a Christian and you're still living like the world you're you're instead of looking at what God promised you're looking off at the world looking at all the things the world offers in first John it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not even any for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God forever abideth forever and and I said we're going to close on that slide but we'll close on this bless what balaam's teaching was to get the people off looking away from the promise of God and to to think that it just don't matter it don't really matter what you believe and start looking at at at Moab and and like brother Raymond said the hair and the biscuit where they came from and they wanted to be to try to be like Moab and where they come from instead of the promises of God Balaam is preaching was that we're all the same but brother Raymond said in the anointing ones at the end time we are not the same we're not the same
