[19:17] and when we commit the service into your
[19:18] hands now in jesus christ's name amen
[19:21] praise god amen let's turn to matthew
[19:24] chapter 28 matthew chapter 28
[19:27] i i felt led to read this scripture very
[19:29] familiar scripture to us um and it's
[19:33] entitled in the in the uh
[19:35] in the bible as the great commission in
[19:38] verse 16.
[19:40] and jesus says
[19:42] jesus says some things here he says in
[19:44] verse 16 that says then the 11 disciples
[19:47] went away into galilee into a mountain
[19:50] where jesus had appointed them
[19:52] and when they saw him they worshiped him
[19:54] but some doubted
[19:57] and jesus came and spake unto them
[19:59] saying
[20:00] all power all power
[20:03] is given unto me in heaven and earth
[20:06] so all power at this point was given to
[20:09] him he had he had raised from the dead
[20:11] amen so he had conquered death hell in
[20:13] the grave praise god and so he said all
[20:16] power
[20:17] is given unto him amen and if all if he
[20:20] has all power then what is he
[20:23] he's god amen
[20:25] and when you have him in you then what
[20:27] do you have
[20:28] all power
[20:30] i believe that amen praise god
[20:33] and this is this is one of the things
[20:35] that i was trying to get across to the
[20:37] people while we were down there in
[20:38] honduras nicaragua there were several
[20:40] times where i used the scripture to talk
[20:42] to them about water baptism and the holy
[20:45] the holy spirit
[20:46] and uh when you show them that all power
[20:49] was given to him is it's like wow yes
[20:52] and he's in me well i got all power if
[20:54] you could if you could just come to that
[20:56] realization that all power amen praise
[20:59] god and then he says this he says this
[21:01] with all power he says go ye therefore
[21:05] and teach all nations
[21:06] amen in mark 16 he says go you tell the
[21:09] world preach the gospel amen but but it
[21:12] it it it's it's it's teaching preaching
[21:15] amen even when you're preaching you're
[21:17] still teaching
[21:19] because you're enlightening amen to
[21:20] people's eyes
[21:22] even an evangelist it's a form of
[21:24] teaching amen
[21:25] because then what's the next step to do
[21:27] to repent and stuff but i didn't know
[21:29] until the evangelist came through or to
[21:30] the teacher amen preach to preach the
[21:33] word you see so we need the faithful
[21:35] ministry go ye therefore and teach all
[21:37] nations all nations
[21:40] baptizing them in the name in the name
[21:43] of the father
[21:45] end of the son and of the holy ghost not
[21:48] in the name of the father not in the
[21:50] name of the son in the name of the holy
[21:51] ghost now in the name
[21:53] of the father and of the son and of the
[21:55] holy ghost
[21:56] teaching them teaching them to observe
[21:59] all things all things
[22:02] amen whatsoever i have commanded you in
[22:05] other words teaching them to observe the
[22:06] word
[22:08] that i have commanded you and lo i am
[22:10] with you always even unto the end of the
[22:14] world amen praise the lord you may be
[22:16] seated and i wanted to read this quote
[22:18] if the brothers can pull this quote up
[22:22] amen
[22:24] brother branham says here
[22:26] brother if you want to turn on the
[22:27] purple mic
[22:29] please thank you
[22:32] i couldn't get the the
[22:35] praise
[22:36] hey man i couldn't get the little head
[22:37] thing here maybe maybe next time
[22:42] but he says here in in the end time the
[22:44] message the end time 1954 but i am so
[22:46] happy to be here but the more was just
[22:49] telling me that they had taken up an
[22:51] offering for missionary work to be given
[22:52] over to me for missionary work i thank
[22:55] thank you may god bless you and that's
[22:57] what i say to each and every one of you
[22:59] i say to the church if it that offering
[23:02] that the church gave and the different
[23:04] times that you all gave really really
[23:06] helped and so we we just thank god
[23:09] amen they helped them it helped them
[23:11] i just don't know how to say it i it's
[23:15] just something about missionary and i
[23:17] believe he was going to say missionary
[23:18] work missionary that i that i know that
[23:21] what that i'm sorry missionary that i
[23:24] just i just love it
[23:26] and i just know that what you're doing
[23:27] you're doing god's will when you give to
[23:29] missions that is right
[23:31] it's not fair that one person hear the
[23:33] gospel twice when somebody hasn't heard
[23:35] it once
[23:37] see
[23:37] everybody should hear the gospel at
[23:39] least once
[23:41] and i want to do my part to try to take
[23:43] the gospel to everybody that i know how
[23:46] every place
[23:48] used to on the difference of the the re
[23:51] remunerations of the meeting and what
[23:53] i'd had left over i'd give it to the
[23:55] charity organizations and so forth now i
[23:57] have nothing at all against them not at
[23:59] all and i think they're all fine every
[24:01] one of them from the salvation army and
[24:03] the volunteers of america
[24:05] the red cross polio drives and many of
[24:07] those things it's good to give to those
[24:09] things but i thought the people that
[24:11] comes to my meeting are people who are
[24:14] usually poor people
[24:15] and they're interested in the kingdom of
[24:17] god
[24:18] while common run off people that doesn't
[24:21] go to church businessmen and so forth
[24:22] writes checks for them drives and so
[24:25] forth for thousands and thousands of
[24:26] dollars while a poor missionary suffers
[24:28] with a lack after all we know that we
[24:30] like to see everybody well we like to
[24:32] see people that's hungry be fed but you
[24:35] know the soul is the most important
[24:36] thing of anything in the mortal amen
[24:39] because that's the thing that lasts
[24:41] forever
[24:42] and you know when i believe that every
[24:44] christian is obligated to be a
[24:45] missionary
[24:47] i believe every christian is obligated
[24:49] now not so much as you have to go over
[24:51] in the old countries and preach or
[24:53] something but if you can't go you can
[24:55] help send somebody else you see what you
[24:58] do to send somebody else and did you
[24:59] ever think what jesus said about when
[25:01] the disciples asked him when he would
[25:03] return again why he said show us the
[25:06] sign that when he would return he said
[25:08] you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars
[25:11] let me ask you this is that are we
[25:12] hearing that
[25:14] all right
[25:15] you'll hear of fathers against mothers
[25:18] and mothers and parents against children
[25:20] and so forth do we hear that
[25:22] you could look in the news and you can
[25:24] see some terrible terrible incidents
[25:27] but that's not yet he says he said
[25:29] there'll be time when they'd be all
[25:31] different and the morals
[25:33] the morals you know how they are now
[25:35] today that mary and given in marriage
[25:38] and so forth it's not yet but he said
[25:39] when this gospel is preached to all the
[25:42] world
[25:43] then he'd return
[25:45] amen
[25:46] and where and where we have done and
[25:48] where we have done christian friends
[25:50] we've failed miserably is that right
[25:52] amen now that was in 1953 i believe it
[25:55] was and ever since then the gospel has
[25:58] definitely advanced amen this message
[26:00] has gone across
[26:03] the world and it's in such a in such a
[26:06] huge way through printing
[26:08] through um
[26:11] and now it's more advanced now it's
[26:13] going faster because you know because of
[26:15] the advent of the internet so it gets
[26:17] spread much faster and faster so i
[26:20] believe we're at the end time saints i
[26:22] believe we are at the end time and so if
[26:24] if we think in our minds well it doesn't
[26:27] matter what's going on in the country
[26:28] such and such or i'm not too concerned
[26:31] about what's going such and such amen
[26:33] those people need the gospel too
[26:36] people people need people need to hear
[26:38] the gospel and there's people that that
[26:41] that i that i came across that they
[26:43] hadn't even they hadn't even been to
[26:45] church
[26:46] so if you can at least say something to
[26:49] get them motivated to start coming to
[26:51] church you know
[26:53] hey it was worth spending a plane ticket
[26:56] to go there you know so i just thank you
[26:58] all amen appreciate each and every one
[27:00] of you i felt led to
[27:02] to read that
[27:04] because it's you it's you that did it
[27:06] amen and through your prayers you're the
[27:08] ones that did it all right here we go
[27:10] part two brother brother
[27:12] brother anderson
[27:14] he's our
[27:15] he's the one working back there
[27:19] all right so we're going to turn off the
[27:21] lights here again
[27:23] what's so funny
[27:26] oh
[27:27] brother the anderson did it remotely
[27:29] [Laughter]
[27:33] all right so last time last time we we
[27:36] stopped uh we we we were um
[27:38] we were in holland this is the holancho
[27:41] in honduras
[27:43] and so and so now we're we're um we're
[27:46] still there because a lot took place
[27:49] there so
[27:50] that's just wanted to give you a point
[27:52] where we're we're at next
[27:55] all right so here um after we had come
[27:57] from the mountains remember the trip
[27:59] we've gone to the mountains uh we went
[28:00] to brother elise church and
[28:04] he had asked me if i could help him with
[28:05] a with a wedding
[28:07] a couple that was getting married
[28:09] this couple they um they were just
[28:11] coming to the lord
[28:13] and so
[28:14] next
[28:17] this is the couple right here and um
[28:21] this is brother ellie he's right now the
[28:23] one in charge of the of this church
[28:25] right now he's not the pastor right now
[28:27] they're praying for a pastor but
[28:29] his call is missionary and he's an
[28:31] evangelist
[28:32] but uh
[28:33] so we were we were helping i was helping
[28:35] him marry this couple and uh
[28:38] this couple right there at the altar
[28:40] they accepted the lord jesus as their
[28:41] savior so not only did they get married
[28:44] to each other but they added a third
[28:45] person in there
[28:46] [Laughter]
[28:48] and that was the lord jesus christ amen
[28:52] later on the next day i got the
[28:53] privilege to baptize both of them in the
[28:55] name of the lord jesus next
[28:59] sideways so right here we're uh we're
[29:01] we're praying uh the the sinner's prayer
[29:03] with them amen and they came they came
[29:05] to the lord jesus there we go right
[29:07] there
[29:08] next
[29:10] all right here we are with them
[29:15] this is sister suwanee and brother
[29:20] gosh i forget i'm so terrible with names
[29:23] i was looking at my wife to see if i can
[29:25] get that help huh
[29:28] well he said no it's not moy says i know
[29:30] that next
[29:32] all right this is it they're after the
[29:34] the wedding this is some some food
[29:37] afterwards
[29:38] next
[29:40] all right and after we we had married uh
[29:43] the we had the wedding there
[29:46] we went to a brother's house there and
[29:48] he asked us to go there to see if we
[29:50] could pray for his home
[29:51] apparently there's been some paranormal
[29:54] activity in his home
[29:56] and he wanted prayer for his house so we
[29:59] gave them prayer cloths and told him to
[30:01] put it in corners of his house
[30:03] uh and uh
[30:05] me and brother ely who was there as well
[30:07] we we we prayed for his home that
[30:10] there's been some different situations
[30:12] that they were talking about next
[30:16] so here uh i'm i'm just
[30:18] telling them
[30:19] and this is the brother's house right
[30:21] here this is his wife
[30:22] and he's got
[30:24] three children
[30:27] next
[30:28] all right so we prayed for them and i
[30:31] told them one of the things and this
[30:32] this applies to you all
[30:34] as well you know a wonderful thing to do
[30:36] is to just have the prophet playing in
[30:38] the background
[30:40] have scripture playing in the black in
[30:41] the background the whole time you know
[30:43] because that warts off demons i believe
[30:45] that
[30:46] amen the word of god amen words off
[30:48] demons you know not the tape or not but
[30:50] it's the word of god
[30:52] i encourage them to do that you know in
[30:54] their home so
[30:55] this is the the church again the
[30:57] following day uh
[30:58] and so i knew that that we were going to
[31:01] have a baptism some baptisms that day so
[31:04] i felt led that day that morning to
[31:07] teach them about water baptism and and
[31:09] and just go in depth with it because
[31:11] they they hear water baptism in the name
[31:13] lord jesus christ and they know they
[31:15] don't they know it's it's in the word
[31:16] but when you actually give them the
[31:18] scriptures give them quotes and just
[31:20] really dig into it it helps solidify
[31:22] that even more you see next
[31:26] all right and uh
[31:27] right before right before um
[31:30] we had service this is the church
[31:33] this is brother elise church and they're
[31:35] getting ready to build unto the church
[31:38] right here so he was showing me the
[31:39] little parcel
[31:40] uh where they started the work right
[31:43] here um they have some they have some um
[31:46] some funds that were that were donated
[31:48] to them uh from one of the churches up
[31:50] in ohio and so they're gonna get that
[31:53] going uh
[31:54] some of the funds that you all gave went
[31:57] to help and pay
[31:59] some of those brothers that are going to
[32:00] be working on that church
[32:02] they're going to be working all week or
[32:04] two weeks in a row
[32:06] and they're going to be leaving their
[32:07] own job in order to work on the church
[32:09] so they're not going to be getting paid
[32:11] to feed you know help feed their family
[32:13] just because they're dedicating their
[32:14] whole time to the church so some of
[32:16] those funds went to help them and to
[32:19] help him and that and that so
[32:21] next
[32:23] all right this is the beginning of the
[32:24] of the service as i said a lot of them
[32:27] they usually they they have accustomed
[32:29] to go to the altar and just pray before
[32:32] before they get started which i i think
[32:35] that's wonderful and so as you as the
[32:38] parent does you know your children
[32:39] follow as well
[32:41] next
[32:44] all right this is if the brothers i
[32:45] don't know if there's
[32:47] this is a little
[32:49] at the song service
[32:52] you see this the church has grown a lot
[32:55] and
[32:57] it's it's it's very small so that's why
[32:59] they're gonna add on to it
[33:02] this is the sister that we married yet
[33:04] the the day before sister suwani
[33:07] okay next
[33:11] all right and this is me coming out
[33:19] all right next
[33:23] yes you must be baptized in the name of
[33:25] the lord jesus christ
[33:28] next
[33:33] all right so this is after the service
[33:35] this is where we were walking to the to
[33:37] the river
[33:38] um go to the waters
[33:40] i don't know if you want to turn that up
[33:42] here are some of the brethren
[33:45] uh
[33:47] behind us
[33:48] i believe there's one or two people that
[33:50] are going to get baptized it could be
[33:52] four
[33:55] but i'm not i'm not totally sure
[33:57] careful but
[34:01] christine was walking in front of me so
[34:04] um
[34:05] so originally yeah i thought that there
[34:07] was going to be about two three people
[34:09] uh they were going to get baptized but
[34:11] then as we were baptizing more work more
[34:14] were coming more kept coming they wanted
[34:16] to get baptized or re-baptized so it was
[34:19] a total of seven people that we baptized
[34:21] next
[34:25] um
[34:25] [Music]
[34:27] yeah this would be second second week
[34:29] [Music]
[34:31] next
[34:33] all right the first sister we baptized
[34:34] as the sister uh she she was up from the
[34:38] mountains where we were uh where we were
[34:40] at
[34:40] and uh
[34:42] she she got baptized i think she's like
[34:43] 13 14 years old next
[34:47] then this brother came
[34:49] and he he wanted to get baptized as well
[34:52] next
[34:54] and that sister suwani the sister they
[34:55] got married the day before and so she
[34:58] she she wanted to get baptized and so we
[35:01] baptized her in the name of the lord
[35:03] jesus christ next
[35:06] uh and then little marquitos his name is
[35:09] marcos and he wanted to get baptized
[35:12] and so hey
[35:13] come
[35:15] come in
[35:16] next
[35:18] and then and then this is brother sister
[35:20] suwanee's uh husband and he wanted to
[35:23] get baptized as well so we went ahead
[35:25] and baptized him they have to get where
[35:27] we were at they had to get in their
[35:29] knees on their knees some of the taller
[35:30] ones and then i dip them that way
[35:33] because it was not a lot of water there
[35:36] next
[35:38] all right and then this br brother my
[35:40] brother roberto he came and wanted to
[35:42] get baptized as well actually he wanted
[35:44] to get re-baptized and kind of
[35:46] rededicate his life to the lord next
[35:50] and this young brother as well he wanted
[35:53] to get baptized in the name of the lord
[35:55] jesus christ of them have already
[35:57] accepted the lord jesus but they just
[35:58] wanted to go on ahead and get baptized
[36:01] next
[36:04] and this is brother roberto right here
[36:07] if you want to turn it up a little bit
[36:18] and he wanted to put his stake down so
[36:20] the satan can see that
[36:22] this is it
[36:25] and so i baptize you
[36:27] in the name of the lord jesus christ for
[36:28] the remission of sins
[36:36] okay
[36:37] next
[36:40] all right and this is this little young
[36:42] brother getting baptized
[36:44] [Music]
[36:45] as you're baptizing their their
[36:47] you know sometimes they they kept
[36:48] playing and
[36:51] and and i would tell them something
[36:52] sometimes i would tell them to stop but
[36:54] they're like no no you go ahead we just
[36:56] keep playing
[36:58] they stop there
[37:06] his name is brother kevin
[37:12] [Music]
[37:15] amen
[37:16] next
[37:18] all right this is afterwards
[37:20] um they're at the river
[37:22] next
[37:24] all right and um
[37:25] and so we had a final prayer with some
[37:27] of the brethren and i gave them a final
[37:29] a final word in regards to uh how to
[37:32] continue
[37:33] uh you know because i explained to them
[37:35] some sometimes
[37:37] we kind of get an idea and the lord can
[37:39] do that he'd give you the holy ghost
[37:40] right there at that that in that water
[37:43] but sometimes it's it's a it's a fight
[37:45] you know it's a continual amen
[37:47] it's being born again the bible says
[37:50] and and i told him listen the way you
[37:53] you get the holy ghost is by receiving
[37:55] his word
[37:56] as you listen to the word as you go to
[37:58] church and you listen to the word and
[38:00] you read the word and you study the word
[38:02] amen that is you are receiving his
[38:05] spirit amen because his words are spirit
[38:08] and truth amen he said my words are
[38:10] spirit and truth so i was trying to
[38:12] explain that to them to tell them listen
[38:14] you don't you didn't have to feel
[38:15] anything
[38:16] you don't have to feel anything when you
[38:17] went down the water and now now it's the
[38:20] battle now it's a it's a fight for you
[38:21] to continue on amen as you're feeding on
[38:24] the word you're receiving that word amen
[38:26] and so we had a final prayer with them
[38:28] there and i encourage them in that way
[38:30] next
[38:32] all right so that evening uh we went and
[38:35] visited another brother's church uh
[38:37] brother uh naftali
[38:39] and uh in about an hour away in
[38:41] catacamas
[38:43] and
[38:44] and this is his little church there next
[38:47] actually it's not a small church it's a
[38:49] big church
[38:50] next
[38:54] this is uh
[38:55] some of them singing the special
[38:58] this is brother that got baptized this
[39:00] morning that morning
[39:01] [Music]
[39:08] all right that's that's the pastor
[39:10] brother neph dudley
[39:12] next
[39:14] and this is me uh
[39:16] preaching to them and i was bringing
[39:18] them that little
[39:20] thought from uh
[39:22] at this moment about james chapter four
[39:24] uh draw night unto god and he will draw
[39:26] an eye on to you amen it's not it's not
[39:29] you drawing i unto god and god's just
[39:32] there waiting for you no as you're doing
[39:33] your part he's doing his and so that's
[39:36] what i was trying to bring across to
[39:37] them
[39:40] [Applause]
[39:53] as well
[40:01] [Applause]
[40:09] and you might say well you you all may
[40:11] have heard me saying that here but to
[40:13] them that's important and the reason why
[40:15] is because to them they think that it's
[40:17] all about works
[40:19] what i can do to please god but they
[40:21] don't understand that god there's a part
[40:23] that he wants to do
[40:25] but when you do your part he does his
[40:27] you see
[40:28] so so
[40:30] and it's just a thing that that just
[40:32] trying to get him out of that mindset
[40:35] he's the one that does it for us
[40:37] amen we just we just get into it amen
[40:40] and ride
[40:42] as that as brother brandon would talk
[40:43] about that vision that he on the right
[40:45] i'm riding on it i'm riding on it amen
[40:48] he's the one who's in control amen
[40:50] praise god next
[40:52] all right and afterwards we had a prayer
[40:56] and we're there praying for the people
[40:57] next
[40:59] all right and we took uh we took on this
[41:01] trip about 20 um about 22 bibles
[41:06] they were donated from brother berry
[41:07] coffee they're in hickory north carolina
[41:10] and
[41:11] this is one of the sisters receiving the
[41:12] bible she doesn't have she didn't have a
[41:14] bible
[41:15] so we gave her a bible
[41:17] next
[41:19] this is a young sister who had a bible
[41:21] but it was it was it was a bible that
[41:24] the translation or the interpretation
[41:26] into spanish wasn't wasn't good
[41:29] and so we went ahead and gave her a new
[41:32] bible and
[41:35] next
[41:36] all right so
[41:38] now after all that hard day's work
[41:41] we get some leisure time and of course
[41:42] the dogs are looking at you there's dogs
[41:45] everywhere there
[41:46] so when you eat this is what this is
[41:48] what uh
[41:49] you got dogs there just looking at you
[41:53] of course you got beans right beans and
[41:55] rice we got plenty of that over there
[41:58] actually we ate so much of it it
[42:00] actually starts hurting you really bad
[42:04] next
[42:06] all right so the uh the following uh
[42:09] the following day we we took a break and
[42:12] then we went back to talanga
[42:14] where brother eric brother eric's house
[42:16] was we we we rested that monday and then
[42:19] on tuesday brother eric and some other
[42:22] or uh some other brothers we went up to
[42:25] uh they were gonna have a minister's
[42:26] meeting about three hours away from from
[42:29] talanga
[42:30] and uh this is a minister's meeting uh
[42:33] the day it started this is all ministers
[42:36] and pastors from around the country in
[42:38] honduras
[42:39] just meeting in one place
[42:41] and they usually do this bi-monthly they
[42:44] just have meetings together and just
[42:46] fellowship together and uh
[42:49] and they don't really talk about
[42:50] doctrines and things like that they just
[42:52] kind of have fellowship to keep that
[42:54] that going you see like we have
[42:55] fellowship meetings here so that that's
[42:57] that's good that they do that next
[43:00] and then at nights in those fellowship
[43:02] meetings they have a tent
[43:04] this tent was donated here from brethren
[43:06] in the united states and so
[43:09] in that tent
[43:10] anybody can go to those meetings and so
[43:13] they're more of evangelistic like so
[43:16] that that's that's when they started
[43:19] it's about four day meeting
[43:21] next
[43:24] next okay so they invited they asked me
[43:27] to speak on one of the nights i believe
[43:29] was out that week on that wednesday
[43:31] night and i got to preach to about 500
[43:34] people there um and so there was a lot
[43:37] of there was a lot of people there the
[43:38] last night i would say about 600 or so
[43:41] people there
[43:42] and
[43:43] really wonderful time we had next
[43:47] next
[43:50] this is right after i had preached i had
[43:52] preached on blind bartimaeus and just
[43:54] talked about faith
[43:56] and just trying to get their
[43:58] faith and
[43:59] have faith in god
[44:02] and this is us worshiping afterwards
[44:04] [Music]
[44:08] no as i said you know they have that
[44:11] custom where where your sister sit on
[44:13] one side brother sit on the other side
[44:15] so that's why
[44:16] you see it like that
[44:19] [Music]
[44:21] okay so this time i'm going to ask my
[44:23] wife to come up
[44:25] and i'm going to ask zoe to come up as
[44:26] well so you don't have to hear my boring
[44:29] uh
[44:30] voice
[44:31] for for a little bit
[44:33] i want her to explain what's going on
[44:35] here because i wasn't there
[44:37] during during
[44:38] while
[44:39] we were at the minister's meeting
[44:41] three hours away my wife was back in
[44:43] talanga honduras and they were they were
[44:46] they used the funds
[44:47] uh they were given here
[44:50] to buy
[44:51] food for for people so i want her to
[44:53] explain about that
[45:01] so
[45:03] that was pretty much the trip he would
[45:05] be with us for a day or so and then he'd
[45:08] be out again so
[45:10] um the girls and i and sister rebecca
[45:13] she's a pastor's wife right there this
[45:15] is her mother-in-law this is her mom
[45:18] and
[45:21] we had started talking about
[45:24] because i know that people had given
[45:26] money and
[45:27] wanted to give some food also some
[45:30] clothes and
[45:33] after asking around i was finding out
[45:35] that people would actually sell their
[45:37] clothes for food
[45:40] so we just went ahead and got the food
[45:42] so this is around week two week three we
[45:46] initially had um
[45:49] budgeted for 16
[45:51] bags 16 families
[45:53] but towards the end it ended up being 20
[45:56] bags it wasn't gonna be for the whole
[45:59] church because
[46:01] the budget wouldn't
[46:02] i mean we could have done it but then
[46:05] we couldn't come back
[46:08] so
[46:09] the the pastor's wife she knew the
[46:11] people so she had decided she made the
[46:13] list of the people who needed it most so
[46:16] she was in charge of that
[46:19] it cost in total it went to about 400 to
[46:22] 450 dollars
[46:24] and
[46:25] rebecca and i went around town and we
[46:28] kind of negotiated with the
[46:31] the store the people that sold in bulk
[46:34] and
[46:35] you know i kind of had to say you know
[46:37] if you give us a deal
[46:39] we might just do this again in a bigger
[46:41] scale so
[46:43] but um so that's why we were able to get
[46:45] it down to that price
[46:47] um
[46:49] so it's pretty much the staples
[46:52] um you'll see that we had the stuff i'm
[46:55] trying to think of but
[46:56] it was beans we got at least 80 to 100
[47:00] pounds of beans
[47:02] and we've got the rice the flour we've
[47:04] got pasta
[47:06] like you see them right there there's
[47:07] the rice
[47:10] sugar salt and their pasta sauces
[47:14] coffee we got them that
[47:17] also
[47:19] we got the laundry detergent for them
[47:22] dish soap powdered milk
[47:24] we got cooking oil there butter as well
[47:26] and even toilet paper which is yeah you
[47:29] don't
[47:30] you need food but it was nice to get on
[47:32] toilet paper
[47:34] but depending on the size of the family
[47:38] the bag i don't know if there is are
[47:40] there more slices
[47:42] can we get some more slides
[47:46] because we pack them up
[47:48] in um
[47:50] bags
[47:51] next
[47:53] so it was and we put a little bow later
[47:56] on
[47:58] and um
[47:59] depending on the size of the family it
[48:01] would have lasted them about two two
[48:03] weeks to a month
[48:04] so it's just you know it's just the
[48:06] staples but it went a long way and the
[48:09] testimony that goes with that this was
[48:11] just something that we wanted to do
[48:13] um
[48:15] so sister rebecca
[48:18] that friday night they have friday night
[48:20] meetings
[48:21] the girls and i decided to stay back
[48:23] because we weren't feeling too well
[48:25] after the service
[48:27] they came back and they called me i was
[48:30] upstairs and
[48:31] sister rebecca told me that a sister
[48:33] wanted to come and talk to me
[48:36] and
[48:37] she didn't tell the whole church that
[48:39] there were these donations she just told
[48:41] specific people
[48:43] and one of she told the couple sisters
[48:46] to you can either come tonight or
[48:48] tomorrow
[48:50] it's up to you like she was just telling
[48:52] them discreetly but that night right
[48:54] after service she wanted to come
[48:57] and she so i just thought she wanted to
[49:00] say thank you so you know that was that
[49:02] was great and
[49:04] but she came and told me actually
[49:07] that she was praying that day
[49:11] for god to give her some food because
[49:13] they didn't have any food the next day
[49:18] so that was
[49:20] the lord's
[49:21] answering her prayer
[49:24] so
[49:27] should i go ahead
[49:30] oh there's more pictures next
[49:34] so that's how they came
[49:36] they were they got pretty heavy
[49:39] but um the
[49:42] this match was pretty much dispersed in
[49:45] about three churches
[49:47] so it the plan was just for one church
[49:50] but
[49:51] um it just so happened that we were able
[49:54] to bring a few in this church and a few
[49:55] of the other churches
[49:57] can i go ahead and give my testimony
[50:00] so this is just pausing i wanted to
[50:03] going back to week two in honduras where
[50:05] we had the baptism you guys saw a little
[50:08] bit of the terrain that we had to go
[50:09] through
[50:10] to get to the water and then after the
[50:13] baptism
[50:16] after the baptism
[50:18] we were walking back
[50:21] i said i wasn't gonna cry
[50:24] so we were walking back the people were
[50:26] ahead of me
[50:27] luis was back there helping because
[50:30] there were a lot of people there were
[50:31] some elderly that came so he was helping
[50:33] them the terrain was really bad you had
[50:35] to really look at what you were
[50:37] walking on
[50:38] so i was just walking
[50:41] and i took a bad step and it was deeper
[50:44] than i thought
[50:45] no one was with me
[50:47] no one knew what happened
[50:50] and all i knew was my left foot popped
[50:55] and my vision went white and i felt pain
[50:58] shoot up my head
[51:00] and the thought that came to my mind was
[51:04] lord i need my left foot we still have
[51:06] five more weeks here
[51:09] i can't
[51:10] i can't be debilitated
[51:12] i need my foot
[51:15] so i just said
[51:17] thank you lord for healing me
[51:20] and i kept walking it hurt
[51:23] but each step i said thank you lord for
[51:25] healing me
[51:27] and i just kept walking and i kept
[51:29] saying thank you lord for healing me
[51:31] because i need my foot
[51:36] said
[51:37] i said i didn't come to honduras to lay
[51:39] in the bed for the next five weeks
[51:43] so it was still quite a bit of a walk
[51:46] and i was just by myself just kept
[51:48] saying and it took about 10 more minutes
[51:50] just walking
[51:52] but by the time we got to where the cars
[51:54] were i sat inside the car luis knew
[51:56] nothing
[51:57] the girls didn't know anything
[52:01] and
[52:02] but by then my foot was fine i didn't
[52:05] say anything to anyone
[52:08] and
[52:10] it was just that evening when luis found
[52:12] out about it
[52:13] but i didn't know
[52:16] that i would need that situation
[52:19] about two weeks later when we got to
[52:21] honduras the first sunday
[52:23] where it was too hot it was very very
[52:26] hot we were exhausted we walked we
[52:28] crossed the border by foot
[52:31] into nicaragua
[52:33] we crossed the border by foot it felt
[52:35] like we were a family that wanted a new
[52:38] life with new names with our luggage
[52:42] but we were we crossed by foot in the
[52:44] sun
[52:45] anyway that sunday we were exhausted
[52:48] and it was absolutely hot inside the
[52:51] church
[52:52] luis was preaching again he didn't know
[52:54] anything about it
[52:57] and i felt
[52:59] what they later told me i had a heat
[53:01] stroke
[53:03] i got up i was gonna go to the bathroom
[53:06] to just kind of cool off but by the time
[53:08] i got there they said i was
[53:10] sitting on the floor
[53:13] and they the pastor's wife got me
[53:16] and they took me to the office where
[53:18] they had air conditioning
[53:20] and all i can remember was louis
[53:23] preaching
[53:25] and they said i was mumbling
[53:28] but in my mind i was hearing myself
[53:30] saying lord you healed my left foot just
[53:34] two weeks ago i need that same healing
[53:36] now
[53:38] because i still need i still have two
[53:40] more weeks here
[53:43] and i just kept i remember just saying
[53:45] that in my head i thought i was saying
[53:47] it out loud but they said i was just
[53:49] mumbling they said my my lips turned
[53:51] green and my lips turned white
[53:54] but um
[53:57] after a while i just
[53:58] felt sweat and then i was okay after
[54:01] that
[54:02] but i remember thinking
[54:04] that's why i had i had to have that
[54:07] happen with my left foot
[54:10] to feel that
[54:12] that healing when when you didn't have
[54:14] anyone there
[54:16] and there's no doctor to help you
[54:19] but it brought me back to that time
[54:21] where i said lord you
[54:23] you healed my foot when i asked you
[54:26] so i need to be okay because look my
[54:29] husband's preaching
[54:30] and i need to be fine
[54:32] so here we are
[54:34] [Applause]

[1:03:17] monday that monday
[1:03:18] the next day that's when we were going
[1:03:20] to go up to this uh place it was about
[1:03:23] the place that zoe was talking about it
[1:03:25] was about four hours away walking uh
[1:03:27] called mahala verde and we were going to
[1:03:29] deliver some food to them to those
[1:03:31] places some of those bags as well as uh

[1:03:40] not anybody from the states and so we
[1:03:43] were going to visit that church next we
[1:03:44] left out that that morning
[1:03:46] and then that's that's us
[1:03:48] there's the food bags right here
[1:03:51] right behind them
[1:03:55] there's brother eric and there's brother
[1:03:58] estevan
[1:04:00] um
[1:04:01] brother estevan
[1:04:04] there's some more pictures of him
[1:04:06] brother steven he's about 21 22 years
[1:04:08] old and he was one of the ones who he
[1:04:11] actually last year two years ago
[1:04:14] was on um
[1:04:15] he was on one of those caravans of
[1:04:17] people coming in from from central
[1:04:19] america
[1:04:20] and
[1:04:21] he got you know he just wanted to take
[1:04:24] the opportunity to come and so
[1:04:26] he tried to come but when they got to
[1:04:28] around uh they got they went through
[1:04:31] guatemala they and they got to mexico
[1:04:34] and and when they got to the border of
[1:04:36] mexico in the united states
[1:04:39] he just gave himself in
[1:04:41] because he couldn't take it anymore he
[1:04:43] walked all that way
[1:04:45] from honduras and that was like i think
[1:04:48] it was
[1:04:48] 15 days
[1:04:50] that he walked
[1:04:52] just to get you know to to the states so
[1:04:54] he was one of those those that
[1:04:56] and he told me all about it and
[1:04:58] i mean the good thing is that he had age
[1:05:00] on his side he's
[1:05:02] 20 22 years old he was pretty young but
[1:05:04] uh
[1:05:06] next
[1:05:08] all right so now we got to a point to
[1:05:11] there in the mahara verde where where we
[1:05:13] couldn't take the truck up anymore that
[1:05:15] white truck
[1:05:16] so we had to we had to start walking and
[1:05:18] this is where the uh the three-hour trek
[1:05:20] was was
[1:05:22] that's me blowing my nose because i mean
[1:05:24] my allergies just really
[1:05:26] kicked in
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:29] next
[1:05:33] all right
[1:05:37] and uh this right here on the left uh is
[1:05:40] brother esteban the brother now
[1:05:42] he he's walking with flip-flops on
[1:05:47] and he walked the whole way with
[1:05:49] flip-flops
[1:05:51] i hope he didn't walk to mexico that way
[1:05:54] either but
[1:05:55] next
[1:05:57] and it was it was hot
[1:06:00] but the views are beautiful
[1:06:02] now this is the truck
[1:06:04] trying to make it what what the truck
[1:06:06] would do this is like a 1982 little toy
[1:06:08] toyota
[1:06:09] and what what what if what the truck
[1:06:11] would do is we would go down
[1:06:15] i threw something in the truck and
[1:06:17] whatever try to do is try to get some
[1:06:19] speed you know so to make it you know to
[1:06:21] make it further
[1:06:23] and uh next
[1:06:26] so it finally got to a point where he
[1:06:27] couldn't go no more they would put rocks
[1:06:29] behind the tires to kind of hold it in
[1:06:32] and try to get you know to to get a so
[1:06:35] that when we push
[1:06:37] hopefully you know it would get it up
[1:06:39] next
[1:06:41] [Applause]
[1:06:42] [Music]
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:56] this was us for about maybe 45 minutes
[1:07:00] and we sometimes would get it up
[1:07:02] a little bit further
[1:07:04] and then
[1:07:06] and so then he'd he'd roll it they'd
[1:07:08] roll it back down
[1:07:13] to try to start over again to you know
[1:07:15] to try to get a little push you know an
[1:07:18] impulse to go up and then back to level
[1:07:20] one
[1:07:22] next
[1:07:24] so finally there was a brother who had a
[1:07:26] motorcycle and this is the food that we
[1:07:28] were carrying the bags of food
[1:07:30] so we told them uh
[1:07:32] you know they were heavy so that's what
[1:07:33] we were hoping we could get the truck up
[1:07:35] there
[1:07:36] because we still had about another two
[1:07:38] hours
[1:07:40] and so the brother said well let's just
[1:07:41] put the food on the motorcycle
[1:07:43] so uh
[1:07:44] he got it on the motorcycle but that
[1:07:46] thing was so wobbly he about fell
[1:07:49] and so uh i don't know if i got video of
[1:07:51] that next
[1:07:53] um so some of us what we did and this is
[1:07:56] brother esteban you can see here by his
[1:07:57] flip-flops here
[1:07:59] and so that bag was heavy but he was
[1:08:01] carrying it carried it the whole way
[1:08:04] and uh so what a brother did is he got
[1:08:06] on that motorcycle another brother and
[1:08:07] he was able to to to write it up you
[1:08:10] know and was able to get the food to the
[1:08:12] to the people so thank god for that but
[1:08:14] there was at one point where he almost
[1:08:16] went back and i thought that seriously i
[1:08:18] have a video of it not here but i really
[1:08:20] thought that he was going to fall off
[1:08:22] the side of that mountain because that
[1:08:23] motorcycle was going back like this
[1:08:26] and by the grace of god nothing happened
[1:08:28] and the food was was saved as well
[1:08:31] next
[1:08:32] all right so this is the church we
[1:08:34] finally got to to the the church this is
[1:08:36] the pastor there
[1:08:38] and this this brother as i said this is
[1:08:41] brother rodolfo brother has been
[1:08:43] pastoring this church since 1974.
[1:08:45] he does everything there at the church
[1:08:47] and he doesn't have anybody really to to
[1:08:49] to help him and doesn't have a lot of
[1:08:51] vision doesn't hardly nobody no visitors
[1:08:54] to to
[1:08:55] you know guest ministers or anything
[1:08:57] like that
[1:08:58] uh one of the things that i wanted to
[1:08:59] mention is that his church is really
[1:09:01] worn out and uh it's actually it's
[1:09:04] cracking
[1:09:05] uh
[1:09:06] the foundations are really cracking and
[1:09:09] so he he was he was he asked for prayer
[1:09:11] about that and he also asked if uh
[1:09:14] monetarily if we could help so that he
[1:09:16] could fix his his church with the cracks
[1:09:18] and i have some some pictures and things
[1:09:20] of of that
[1:09:21] next
[1:09:23] this is up there in one of the areas uh
[1:09:26] when we were up there and we just went
[1:09:28] on to the side and took this picture of
[1:09:29] this little gorge usually there's a
[1:09:30] waterfall right here
[1:09:32] and there's a river down there
[1:09:34] uh believe it or not they told me the
[1:09:36] brethren that the people have jumped off
[1:09:38] there and committed suicide
[1:09:40] so it's a
[1:09:42] it's it's very easy for you to fall off
[1:09:44] and a lot of people know that and
[1:09:47] people that don't have the lord you know
[1:09:48] or you know they just want to end their
[1:09:50] life they've two or three people have
[1:09:52] committed suicide there
[1:09:53] that's what they told me next
[1:09:56] all right this is brother rodolfo's
[1:09:57] church we had we went to his house to
[1:09:59] eat first
[1:10:00] and then we went that's after a
[1:10:03] four-hour walk
[1:10:05] then we had we i had to preach so we all
[1:10:08] had service there and you can see in his
[1:10:10] church right there this is the where the
[1:10:12] church is cracking
[1:10:13] and so he's tried to fix you know uh
[1:10:17] right here you can see in the corners so
[1:10:18] he's trying to fix what they could
[1:10:21] you know but but it but but there's a
[1:10:24] lot of foundation problems and so
[1:10:26] uh they said that
[1:10:29] i'm at this very moment i told him to
[1:10:31] please get an estimate of how much
[1:10:33] things will cost
[1:10:34] and uh
[1:10:36] so we'll see because because there is
[1:10:38] still some some money left over
[1:10:41] from from what you all gave and and
[1:10:43] maybe we can send that to them next
[1:10:46] [Music]
[1:10:51] this is us having service there
[1:10:56] some of these people they're just
[1:10:58] they're just you know
[1:11:01] mountain people you know just all they
[1:11:03] know is farming ranching
[1:11:07] next
[1:11:11] all right we spoke to them that
[1:11:12] afternoon about um
[1:11:15] about when jesus said i am the vine and
[1:11:17] you are the branches
[1:11:19] next
[1:11:23] all right
[1:11:24] next all right afterwards we prayed for
[1:11:27] the people some of them came up
[1:11:29] and asked for for prayers the brother
[1:11:32] the pastor right there
[1:11:34] just a simple brother you know
[1:11:37] next
[1:11:39] all right and that's bella and zoe zoe
[1:11:42] sleeping there on the floor during the
[1:11:45] service after a four-hour walk
[1:11:48] next
[1:11:51] so i was praying for the people there
[1:11:52] next
[1:11:54] all right then afterwards a brother a
[1:11:57] brother went and grabbed the the bags of
[1:11:59] food and we went ahead and gave them
[1:12:01] some of the food there
[1:12:03] to some of those families there
[1:12:06] next
[1:12:09] now this is just some of the video of
[1:12:11] some of the of the church there so you
[1:12:13] can just kind of get an idea of
[1:12:15] of of what's going on
[1:12:18] with the church
[1:12:19] it's sideways this is an entrance one of
[1:12:21] the side entrances there
[1:12:23] there's just a very old building
[1:12:30] next
[1:12:33] this is the the the right there around
[1:12:36] the pulpit area
[1:12:45] so
[1:12:46] i don't know how much that that will
[1:12:48] cost
[1:12:49] to to to fix but
[1:12:51] um
[1:12:52] they know how to work with that all they
[1:12:54] need is just uh they need funds to buy
[1:12:56] the materials to
[1:12:58] next
[1:13:01] this is the walls
[1:13:12] and it's sideways as well the video but
[1:13:15] you can get an idea there
[1:13:17] next
[1:13:19] okay
[1:13:20] just giving them more food next
[1:13:23] and this is the pastor brother rodolfo
[1:13:27] just right before we were leaving
[1:13:31] see what time we got here i'm so sorry 3
[1:13:33] 26 okay we're still good
[1:13:35] all right
[1:13:37] next
[1:13:39] all right so as we were leaving uh we we
[1:13:42] got back on the truck there was another
[1:13:44] brother that went up there and met us so
[1:13:46] he had a better truck
[1:13:47] and so it got around much easier
[1:13:51] and uh
[1:13:52] zoe was entertaining him with something
[1:13:55] he was talking about a uh something
[1:13:58] a bug bite oh yeah bug bites on her arms
[1:14:02] and they were just intently listening to
[1:14:04] her
[1:14:04] [Laughter]
[1:14:06] next
[1:14:09] this is some of the video as we were
[1:14:11] going down the mountain
[1:14:14] a lot of all that that we trekked up
[1:14:16] walking is nice riding down now
[1:14:24] [Music]
[1:14:27] and this is just a very common thing you
[1:14:29] know they all just get on that back of
[1:14:31] the back of the trucks and just
[1:14:35] tightly and hang on
[1:14:42] all right next
[1:14:44] okay
[1:14:46] all right now the following day
[1:14:50] i preached at another church nearby
[1:14:53] this is
[1:14:54] brother lucas cardona's church
[1:14:57] and uh
[1:14:58] his his church originally is under this
[1:15:00] platform but they're building on top of
[1:15:02] it and and so they're they're there
[1:15:05] and they're gonna use that bottom part
[1:15:07] for something else so that's why it's
[1:15:09] kind of open because they're still not
[1:15:11] they're still not complete they're still
[1:15:12] not finished next
[1:15:16] and um
[1:15:17] just wanted to give a quick testimony as
[1:15:19] i was finishing ministering there they
[1:15:21] said that that evening
[1:15:22] a drunk man walks in into the into the
[1:15:25] into the service
[1:15:27] and he sets he sits there and starts
[1:15:29] listening of course the deacons they got
[1:15:31] you know
[1:15:32] make sure he wasn't going to do anything
[1:15:34] you know
[1:15:35] but
[1:15:36] afterwards i went over to him and i
[1:15:38] stood next to him and he said
[1:15:41] i really enjoyed your the sermon i said
[1:15:44] he said i really enjoyed what you had to
[1:15:45] say
[1:15:47] and so i i i told him thank you and i
[1:15:50] said can i pray for you and he said
[1:15:52] please that's why it came for
[1:15:54] and so we i prayed for for him there
[1:15:57] yeah
[1:15:58] and so
[1:15:59] hopefully you know we'll see where that
[1:16:02] led but i i we just
[1:16:04] thank god you know some somebody just
[1:16:06] randomly walking in in this church
[1:16:08] wanting wanting help you know why else
[1:16:11] would you walk into the church he's his
[1:16:13] life has come to a point now where i
[1:16:16] can't take this anymore and he smelled
[1:16:18] bad and everything but we pray for him
[1:16:20] you know so
[1:16:21] next
[1:16:25] this is during song service there that
[1:16:27] that day that same service
[1:16:30] next
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:45] maybe even dead under the ground if it
[1:16:48] wasn't for the grace and mercy of god
[1:16:49] that's what i was telling next
[1:16:53] all right
[1:16:54] so the following day
[1:16:56] this is the following day we went to go
[1:16:59] and visit another church and uh crossing
[1:17:01] the river and there's about two hours
[1:17:03] away and so this is us crossing this
[1:17:05] river
[1:17:07] to agua blanca
[1:17:16] all right next
[1:17:19] all right and then some of the brothers
[1:17:21] were following us in that same little
[1:17:22] white truck
[1:17:23] and i mean they did so much
[1:17:25] to that truck
[1:17:26] on that trek uh he was having problems
[1:17:29] with his radiator
[1:17:30] uh i think that's the radiator right
[1:17:33] and uh so they they were carrying water
[1:17:36] you know to fill it up with water but
[1:17:38] eventually uh there was damage there
[1:17:40] that that had to be fixed a different
[1:17:42] way next
[1:17:46] and this is the church this is this is
[1:17:48] actually the church the the church that
[1:17:50] brother eric
[1:17:52] you uh was pastoring before
[1:17:54] that uh
[1:17:55] i believe we helped here in this church
[1:17:57] build this church here
[1:17:59] and they're still gathering there
[1:18:01] they still they they they need a pastor
[1:18:04] but
[1:18:05] brother eric uh
[1:18:08] was led to go to where he's pastoring
[1:18:10] now
[1:18:10] because that group really needed we
[1:18:12] needed his help so they have somebody in
[1:18:14] charge right now of the church
[1:18:16] but uh
[1:18:18] they they're praying for a pastor
[1:18:20] next
[1:18:23] uh and they're still adding buildings uh
[1:18:26] uh adding some things to the church

[1:30:57] that's that's the next day
[1:30:59] after that
[1:31:00] long that was
[1:31:03] my wife took that picture of us
[1:31:06] next
[1:31:09] all right this is in another area there
[1:31:11] in choluteca
[1:31:13] uh
[1:31:14] bella playing with some of the kids
[1:31:15] there
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:19] this is uh now sort of
[1:31:22] this is another video i'm not sure what
[1:31:24] happened there
[1:31:25] this is some of the little girls there
[1:31:27] next
[1:31:29] and then we were there drinking some
[1:31:31] coconut water
[1:31:32] and if you've never had fresh coconut
[1:31:34] water in my it's good
[1:31:36] it's good next
[1:31:38] all right uh
[1:31:40] this brother right here
[1:31:42] and i really uh i'm so terrible with
[1:31:45] names
[1:31:46] i remember faces all day long
[1:31:49] but the brother uh he's an evangelist
[1:31:51] and he's been evangelizing for many
[1:31:54] years
[1:31:54] but i believe he told me that he's
[1:31:56] baptized over 300 something people
[1:31:59] during his lifetime
[1:32:00] and so i just thought that was amazing
[1:32:02] you know you know just just
[1:32:05] him where and he's still evangelizing he
[1:32:07] still goes around preaching the word of
[1:32:08] god through honduras still baptizing
[1:32:11] people adding to that number
[1:32:17] yes he fell off a motorcycle just had to
[1:32:19] recently before that and uh it was a
[1:32:22] terrible accident the one that he was
[1:32:24] riding in the back and the one that was
[1:32:26] was uh driving the motorcycle he he got
[1:32:29] hurt
[1:32:30] but uh
[1:32:31] he hit his head luckily he had a helmet
[1:32:33] but still
[1:32:35] it was still kind of bothering him so
[1:32:37] you remember that brother in prayer
[1:32:40] it's nothing but the devil trying to
[1:32:41] hinder and they were going to actually
[1:32:43] go and go to to preach the gospel when
[1:32:46] the accident happened so next

[1:36:30] appreciate it
[1:36:32] so let's read in the description first
[1:36:34] corinthians
[1:36:36] if you want to read along that's fine if
[1:36:38] you don't i'll read it here in chapter
[1:36:39] 11 verse 23
[1:36:42] so for i have received of the lord that
[1:36:43] which also i delivered unto you that the
[1:36:45] lord jesus the same night in which he
[1:36:47] was betrayed took bread
[1:36:49] and when he had given thanks he break
[1:36:50] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:36:53] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:36:56] of me after the same manner also he took
[1:36:58] the cup
[1:36:59] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:37:01] the new testament
[1:37:03] see that testator had to die
[1:37:05] there's a new testament coming in
[1:37:07] the old testament was under bulls and
[1:37:09] goats the new testament which there the
[1:37:11] testator had to die
[1:37:13] but he's writing a new testament in his
[1:37:15] blood that it was going to take blood
[1:37:19] to wash away our sins
[1:37:21] not to cover it take heed this is my
[1:37:23] body which is broken for you this dude
[1:37:25] remembers to me after the same matter he
[1:37:26] took the cup and when he stopped saying
[1:37:28] this cup is in new testament
[1:37:30] in my blood this do you as often as you
[1:37:32] drink it
[1:37:33] in remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:37:35] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:37:38] shew the lord's death
[1:37:39] till he comes
[1:37:41] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:37:43] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:37:44] unworthily
[1:37:46] amen the prophet of god said you need to
[1:37:49] be born again living the life of christ
[1:37:52] before you can take communion all right
[1:37:55] because if you do take it unworthy
[1:37:56] listen to what happens
[1:38:00] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:38:02] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:38:04] unworthily shall be guilty
[1:38:06] of the body and blood of the lord now
[1:38:07] what do we say the body's what is the
[1:38:09] body
[1:38:10] it's not his body sitting up there on
[1:38:11] the throne it's this church body it's
[1:38:14] the body of christ that we're doing you
[1:38:17] know you do something wrong you're doing
[1:38:18] it against the body
[1:38:20] amen
[1:38:22] excuse me for as often as you eat this
[1:38:24] bread and drink this cup you do show the
[1:38:26] lord's death till he come wherefore
[1:38:28] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:38:30] this cup of the lord unworthily shall be
[1:38:31] guilty of the body and blood of the lord
[1:38:34] but let a man examine himself
[1:38:36] in other words stop we're going to stop
[1:38:37] here in just a few minutes examine
[1:38:39] yourself
[1:38:41] if you have an audience somebody the
[1:38:43] prophet of god said make it right
[1:38:45] amen
[1:38:48] but you can't just be clear
[1:38:51] because we're taking this in
[1:38:52] commemoration of somebody dying for us
[1:38:55] one man dying for our sins but let a man
[1:38:57] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:38:59] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:39:01] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:39:03] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:39:05] not discerning the lord's body
[1:39:08] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:39:10] among you in many sleep
[1:39:12] it's pretty serious
[1:39:14] that ain't talking about falling asleep
[1:39:16] that's talking about dying
[1:39:18] amen many are sick many are weak and
[1:39:20] many die because you take this
[1:39:22] unworthily
[1:39:24] amen
[1:39:25] so we need to examine ourselves
[1:39:28] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:39:30] should not be judged but when we are
[1:39:31] judged we are chastened of the lord that
[1:39:33] we should not be condemned with the
[1:39:35] world thank god
[1:39:37] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:39:39] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:39:41] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:39:42] home
[1:39:43] did he come not together into
[1:39:45] condemnation and the rest will i set an
[1:39:46] order
[1:39:47] when i come let's just have a moment of
[1:39:49] silent prayer
[1:39:51] pray for you pastor pray for
[1:39:54] the sins that you've done this week and
[1:39:57] anything that's going on in your life
[1:39:58] just ask god to clear it out and you
[1:40:00] know what that's a good time good clear
[1:40:01] the slate get the slate clean and let's
[1:40:04] get started
[1:40:16] lord i ask you to bless and cleanse each
[1:40:18] one of us father
[1:40:19] thank you for our brother louise lord i
[1:40:20] pray that you give him a special
[1:40:22] blessing lord for the things he did for
[1:40:23] you
[1:40:24] i pray as we take this communion lord
[1:40:26] that it will rejuvenate us lord and
[1:40:28] strengthen us for the time not so much
[1:40:30] as human strength but spiritual strength
[1:40:32] lord that we can stand in the wilds of
[1:40:33] the devil that's coming against us in
[1:40:34] this end time and all that's going on in
[1:40:37] the world lord me
[1:40:38] you told us that you would be a shelter
[1:40:40] now you'd be a pavilion that we could
[1:40:42] run into lord well today we're running
[1:40:44] into that pavilion lord we're taking the
[1:40:46] body and blood and we're as a symbol
[1:40:48] we're receiving this lord that'll make
[1:40:50] us better people that'll make us better
[1:40:52] christians father in this world we ask
[1:40:54] these things in jesus name amen
[1:40:57] the bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:40:58] it
[1:40:59] dear lord jesus thank you for this bread
[1:41:01] and i pray lord that you would sanctify
[1:41:03] it lord that will nourish our bodies and
[1:41:05] they'll remember that it was you father
[1:41:07] that hung on calvary lord to release
[1:41:09] your life lord as you come back into us
[1:41:11] lord as believers
[1:41:12] father forgive us of our sins and bless
[1:41:14] us in jesus name amen
[1:41:19] you know as many
[1:41:20] many times every time like this happens
[1:41:22] and even when brotherdale would do it i
[1:41:24] could remember back when we were
[1:41:27] um in the baptist church where they
[1:41:28] would just take some old wafer that
[1:41:30] somebody bought and probably at that
[1:41:32] time it wasn't made in china no offense
[1:41:35] but
[1:41:36] it probably was not made with holy hands
[1:41:38] this needs to be made with holy hands
[1:41:41] this is not something we do
[1:41:43] that we buy grape juice and
[1:41:46] buy a piece of bread
[1:41:48] no
[1:41:49] sister lisa makes the bread made by holy
[1:41:51] hands brother dale makes the wine
[1:41:54] also made by holy hands so i believe
[1:41:56] we're doing
[1:41:57] you know if you'll do the right thing
[1:41:58] it'll come back to you the wrong thing
[1:42:00] too but if we do the thing right
[1:42:03] and do it right and get started right
[1:42:10] i've never had to ask forgiveness for
[1:42:12] something i did right right
[1:42:14] man just think about that
[1:42:17] yep you just asked forgiveness the
[1:42:19] things you did wrong but if we start
[1:42:20] doing things right maybe this adoption
[1:42:22] thing will not be so hard
[1:42:28] what we need to do
[1:42:29] further the gospel
[1:42:32] make each one of us
[1:42:35] and as we take this bread we'll remember
[1:42:38] remember that night
[1:42:40] when he was in that upper room he knew
[1:42:41] he was going to die that next day
[1:42:46] so let's start today by dying out to him
[1:42:50] die out to the lord let the lord do the
[1:42:52] work for us
[1:42:54] but like louise was preaching we got to
[1:42:56] meet him
[1:42:58] he's got to come here
[1:43:00] you got to make an effort but he'll come
[1:43:01] to your effort
[1:43:04] dear heavenly father thank you for this
[1:43:05] wine lord
[1:43:07] i just been made by grapes lord and made
[1:43:09] by holy hands and it's been run through
[1:43:11] a process lord with
[1:43:13] it'll ferment father and it comes to a
[1:43:15] place that it'll it'll not even
[1:43:17] it'll not even sour for years and years
[1:43:19] to come if it's held in the right place
[1:43:21] father we know that's a symbol of your
[1:43:23] word father that your word will never
[1:43:25] return void it will accomplish exactly
[1:43:27] what it said it would it'll never become
[1:43:30] old and moldy and stale father but lord
[1:43:33] i pray that we put today this new wine
[1:43:36] into new glasses into new bottles
[1:43:38] and lord that will show the world
[1:43:41] that we are the bride of jesus christ
[1:43:44] thank you for this time that we have
[1:43:46] lord and this opportunity that we can do
[1:43:47] this lord
[1:43:48] sanctify your people in this journey in
[1:43:50] jesus name amen
[1:43:54] come morning
[1:43:56] i'll walk
[1:43:58] by the river

[1:44:02] i'll rest need thee ever green tree
[1:44:09] i'll carry
[1:44:11] my cross
[1:44:13] through the midnight

[1:44:23] sometimes i'm despised
[1:44:26] and rejected

[1:44:34] how long
[1:44:37] then i take one more look
[1:44:41] at mount calvary keep your eyes on him
[1:44:45] and it gives me
[1:44:46] the strength to
[1:44:49] go on
[1:44:49] [Music]
[1:44:51] come morning
[1:44:53] i'll wall
[1:44:55] by the river
[1:44:58] i'll rest need
[1:45:01] when this is all over
[1:45:03] we'll get to rest and take communion
[1:45:06] and commune with each other
[1:45:08] for an eternity
[1:45:10] this is just a little bit folks
[1:45:13] just a little bit of what we're going to
[1:45:16] have for an eternity i know we're
[1:45:18] creatures of time
[1:45:21] but we are eternal people
[1:45:24] we have an eternal purpose
[1:45:27] amen i don't want us to see that
[1:45:29] everything we do everything we do is
[1:45:31] taking communion foot washing when we
[1:45:33] have a time of prayer a time of
[1:45:36] fellowship
[1:45:38] when we have bible study
[1:45:40] revere that time

[1:45:46] because i know there's different things
[1:45:47] we do during the during the week that
[1:45:48] takes up our time of other things
[1:45:51] but let's just take that little time and
[1:45:53] even like now could you imagine being in
[1:45:55] an upper room and and those 12 didn't
[1:45:57] know what was going to happen
[1:45:59] they really didn't understand
[1:46:02] but buddy i promise you on the day of
[1:46:03] pentecost
[1:46:05] they understood
[1:46:07] what was what was going on what jesus
[1:46:09] had told them and talked to him for
[1:46:10] three and a half years it all came to
[1:46:13] that moment
[1:46:14] to where peter says this is that
[1:46:17] that the prophet spoke of
[1:46:20] that i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[1:46:22] flesh
[1:46:23] and you'll understand
[1:46:24] what's going on
[1:46:27] yo
[1:46:29] we'll understand we'll understand it
[1:46:31] better by and by
[1:46:34] by and by
[1:46:36] when the morning comes
[1:46:38] all the saints of god together at home
[1:46:43] we gonna tell the story
[1:46:46] of how we overcome and we'll understand
[1:46:50] it better by and by
[1:46:53] we're just getting enough
[1:46:55] just enough to get us started
[1:46:57] and then we're going to get out of here
[1:46:59] and then we'll have a eternity
[1:47:04] you know right now we're time brother
[1:47:06] john tomorrow we got to go to work
[1:47:08] tomorrow we got to do this tomorrow we
[1:47:10] got to do that
[1:47:12] it won't be a tomorrow then
[1:47:14] it won't be tomorrow
[1:47:17] it'll be unending
[1:47:19] joy
[1:47:21] but this is just a part of it he said do
[1:47:23] this
[1:47:24] until i come let's take communion
[1:47:36] hmm thank you lord
[1:47:42] father take it up though
[1:47:48] cups let's read
[1:47:50] if you want to follow me john 13
[1:47:54] well jesus watches the disciples feet
[1:47:59] i want you to listen this real close
[1:48:02] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:48:04] been put in the heart of judas's carrot
[1:48:06] simon's son to betray him
[1:48:08] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:48:10] all things into his hand that he was
[1:48:11] come from god
[1:48:12] and he went to god
[1:48:14] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:48:16] garment and took a towel and girded
[1:48:17] himself
[1:48:19] after that he poureth water into a basin
[1:48:21] and began to wash the disciples feet
[1:48:23] and wiped them with the towel for with
[1:48:25] he was girded
[1:48:26] then cometh he to simon peter and peter
[1:48:28] said lord thust thou wash my feet jesus
[1:48:32] answered and said what i do they'll know
[1:48:34] us not now
[1:48:35] in other words you don't have the new
[1:48:37] birth you're not going to understand
[1:48:38] what i'm doing but you're going to
[1:48:40] understand in just a few days after this
[1:48:42] what's going on
[1:48:43] but thou shalt know hereafter
[1:48:46] peter said unto him thou shalt never
[1:48:48] wash my feet
[1:48:50] listen to what jesus said he didn't say
[1:48:52] well that's okay peter you can get by
[1:48:54] with it
[1:48:56] he said peter if i wash thee not
[1:48:58] thou has no part
[1:49:01] with me
[1:49:02] boy that struck peter right in the heart
[1:49:05] because jesus didn't beat around the
[1:49:07] bush he said you're going to do this or
[1:49:08] you're not going to be of me
[1:49:10] so simon peter said lord not only my
[1:49:12] feet but my hands and my head he was
[1:49:14] just washed me all over
[1:49:16] jesus said now he that is washed needeth
[1:49:18] not saved to wash his feet but is clean
[1:49:20] every wit and you're clean but not all
[1:49:22] we know that judas was still there
[1:49:25] for he knew who should betray him
[1:49:26] therefore he said ye are not all clean
[1:49:29] so after they had washed their feet and
[1:49:30] washed it taken the garment was set down
[1:49:32] again he said unto them know you what i
[1:49:34] have done to you that's a question mark
[1:49:37] know you what i've done to you
[1:49:39] you call me master and lord and you say
[1:49:41] well for so i am
[1:49:43] if i then your lord and master in other
[1:49:46] words if god can wash your feet
[1:49:49] you ought to be able to wash each
[1:49:50] other's feet
[1:49:51] that's what he's saying
[1:49:53] you call me mastering lord and you say
[1:49:55] well for so i am
[1:49:57] if i then your lord and master have
[1:49:59] washed your feet
[1:50:01] you also ought to wash one another's
[1:50:03] feet
[1:50:04] for i have given you an example that you
[1:50:06] should do as i have done to you verily
[1:50:08] verily i say unto you the servant is not
[1:50:11] greater than his lord neither he that is
