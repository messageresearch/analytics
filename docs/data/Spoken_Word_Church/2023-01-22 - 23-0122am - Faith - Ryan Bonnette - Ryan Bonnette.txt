and your word and bless this little Sunday school a study this morning give us understanding of it Lord as we uh study about your word in Jesus name amen God bless you can be Satan y'all bear with me just a minute I forgot my notes I have paper notes got too many things to remember so this morning we're going to do a little study about faith because uh it's right in line with what everybody's talking about brother Wade ministering to us about adoption about the Statue of perfect man being you know Faith being the foundation of that and then brother Aaron talking about on that lesson that we know well we know that only comes from Faith you know from a certainty um he's been preaching a really good little series about that and then now brother Bob getting into Hebrews 11 also about faith I don't know exactly what all directions he'll go but you know I just want to keep us meditating on that same thought um right now we're not connecting here so maybe they'll get that going here in a minute a PowerPoint and uh brother Bob was talking about how that Faith uh the whole whole reason that God's word has such strength and such power is because the Integrity of the man Jesus Christ himself because he is truth he is nothing but truth he cannot fail he's all truth I mean to say he cannot fail his work cannot fail so he has this Integrity this character that's steadfast that's sure and that's why his his word has such power and then if you think about it on the opposite side of that the devil the reason his word has no power is because you know he has no Integrity no character he's you know his word uh Satan's word will fail he's nothing but lies in the father of Lies so that's why we don't believe Satan so we're going to talk about faith I want to just basically give you an overview broad overview in a short time span and uh what is Faith and how much power it is at its fullest form the faith of Jesus Christ himself I just want to give one illustration about that and then talk about how do you get this Faith because he made it available to all of us so what is Faith this is not an exhaustive list this is just a few things that came to my mind when I was making this lesson it's not all that faith is but these are some of the things faith is revelation belief in God when I was a Baptist that's all I knew Faith was as well I believe in God that's Faith but that's the beginning of it but there's more of it that it's a reality it's a positive sense a super sense a long-range vision substance it's the most powerful force uh it's a journey that you're going on and it's a place and that sounds kind of odd so I'm going to talk about that especially in this lesson about faith as being a place or a position uh some definitions here about faith relating to Christ as a strong and welcome conviction or belief that Jesus is the messiah through whom we obtain Eternal salvation in the kingdom of God the religious beliefs of Christians belief with the predominant idea of trust or confidence whether in God or in Christ springing from faith in the same fidelity faithfulness the character of one who can be relied on that's what brother Bob was talking about the other day last time we taught Sunday school talking about that we can rely on God more than anything Hebrews 11 definition now Faith is a substitute of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by the elders obtain a good report it doesn't say faith is just the substance you got to be careful not to think that well that's all faith is just the substance hope for now like I said faith is a lot of things it's a really broad subject it's a really broad thing and it covers a lot of ground but faith is among other things it is a substance that's for sure through faith we understand that the world's refrained by the word of God so the things which are made or not things which are seen are not made we're not made of things to appear the stature perfect man brother said notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see in my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is a foundation of all of it for without faith it's impossible to please God in the coming to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him he must be and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it so that's the beginning of Faith keep that in mind believe in God and that's a choice nobody makes you believe you decide in yourself I'm going to believe in Jesus Christ what is sin unbelief there's only two elements that controls a human being that's either doubt or faith one of the other possessive one that dominates your life hahaha and just depends on how much Faith you have how high you can rise but first it's got to be Faith let me stand that foundation for a while Faith Is What You Must Believe faith is a substance of things hoped for it's you already have it when you have faith because it's a revealed in faith faithful seven substance things hoped for the evidence of what is it what kind of evidence a holy evidence and then why Christ speak brother Brandon said for you see Faith sees what God wants done so it has something to do with the will of God the word of God faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't see this here Faith looks to what to see what God wants done and it works accordingly that's what faith does it sees what God wants and what God wants done and Faith operates through that faith is a long-range Vision it don't lower its sights it holds to the Target there's a lot in here let me get to about Divine Healing hopefully I got time for all that answers on a question answered on Genesis now back there them this is my example of my illustration of God's faith God spoke his word in creation and he believed his word so he makes his word with his faith and you're talking about a lot of power um back there then when this little Halo comes now we can't see nothing yet this is Brother bam I'm talking about creation but just by ours of Supernatural we see a Halo standing there now that's the Son of God the logos now I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity before him and now then in his imaginary makeup it began to think of what things would be and I can hear him say let there be light and when he did and Adam bursted and the sun came into existence she Whirled for hundreds of million years forming clinkers and burning and forming like it is today still burning still breaking atoms if the top bomb would ever get loose the atomic chain would take the surface be like the sun Yonder just bursting and blowing if you could stand over on another continent I guess you could say he's probably meaning like another planet or whatever and look at this it would look like another Sun where the atoms was bursting and burning this Earth if this chain would ever get loose and it just started turning rolling like that millions and millions of miles in each of these big Flames billions of Fahrenheit of the heat that goes off of that sun Luke 137 is one quote of scriptures here with God nothing shall be impossible if thou can'tst believe all things are possible in The Believer keep this in mind as we're talking about this great powerful faith that I'm illustrating here watch this now beautiful how he's made the Sun and then the first thing you know a big clinker fell off and weighed about just like the Earth here which then this logos here now the Son of God is watching it here he lets it fall for 100 million years and he stops IT and another one flies off of me lets it flow off fall for mans of years then he stops it now we're standing watching it come into existence now he's got something in his mind and what's he doing he's writing his first Bible I'm gonna give y'all some little things here I'd like to look these up every now and then this is interesting it shows you how much God is in control and how powerful he is the Earth rotates at a thousand miles an hour anybody feel like you're moving a thousand miles an hour right now or if rotates a thousand miles an hour Earth orbits around the Sun at 67 000 miles an hour I think we we feel pretty safe and secure though sounds like God's in control Sun orbits the Galaxy our sun and its solar system orbits the whole galaxy of the Milky Way at 500 000 miles an hour half a million half million miles an hour the Galaxy is a hundred thousand light years across this is a big place not the universe I'm talking about our Milky Way galaxy the estimate to be a hundred thousand light years so if you can go the speed of light 186 000 miles per second for a hundred thousand years it would take you that's what it would take you to cross this whole galaxy and that's just one Galaxy in this whole universe that this guy made this guy Jesus Christ with this great faith that he mixed his word with his faith and made this big of a place just this one Galaxy out of many there's a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy and each one of them has its own planet or planets orbiting it about 170 billion galaxies in the known universe they don't know the end of it yet they can't find an end of it last I heard but it's a big place then estimated 200 billion trillion Stars so take a trillion 200 billion of those and that's about how many stars in the known universe just what they know of what they can estimate it's a big place a super sense it's the most powerful force to ever hit the earth it's that sense called The Sixth Sense has nothing to do with this down here if this down here ever declares it and this it says Amen to it talking about you know aren't us in our natural senses you know to uh you're moving on but regardless of what this does and you know RC tasteful smell here believe that there's where the power if you believe in your heart your fifth sense of thinking lays within your brain but your Sixth Sense lays in your heart you believe with your heart confession is made by the mouth you believe with your heart yes sir that sixth sense that powerful force on just Limitless power we're talking about here the faith of Jesus Christ and he's trying to give us he gave us each a piece of that we each have that by measure faces of substance uh faith is only direct and positive sense and it's in Sixth Sense faith is more than sight it's more than feeling you do not feel Faith you don't taste Faith you don't smell Faith you don't receive Faith faces and substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen thank you Ministry explained now I hope this one thing and faith is another faith is a positive sense it's not a guesswork you don't just imagine it it's just as real as any other sense of your body just the same as sight sight is real hearing is real tasteful smell their sense of the body control the body they're real faculties that if one of them is injured you're let's say faculties to you if none of them is injured and then faith is just as real as any of these other five senses and more real because it'll go in and above those five senses so how do we get this great faith God condescended in his attributes so we could receive them right so you think of like brother Wade used to say this how do you eat an elephant this is a great big faith and we're wanting to come into this great big Faith well how do you eat a great big something like an elephant one bite at a time just a little at a time and you can you can do great things just by taking a little bit of this at a time the word of God every day read your Bible and pray every day listen sermons every day just a little bit at a time it's not impossible God condescendent and agape love by bringing it down to a form Called filial Love or we can get some little grasp of it some little piece of understanding of it same thing with the faith of God he gives us this great big faith in just a little bitty piece for us to understand just just a little portion of it this childlike Faith just believing God Romans 12 for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than you ought to think but I think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith I've got just a few more here and then a video I want to show you all for an illustration Jesus Matthew 16 Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon for Flesh and Blood now revealed unto thee but my father she's in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock about my church The Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against them so faith is a revelation and hell is against it but it won't prevail the angel of God why can't we do that why can't we have that simple faith if we'll just be so wouldn't be so trying to figure things out it happened right here just the same God's no respected person he just respects faith brother Aaron quote that the other night God doesn't heal you on the merits of your salvation it heals you on the merits of your faith now here's a quote not from Brother Branham I'll tell you in a minute who it's from if you're a child of God has to meet you somewhere he's got to he's obligated to his own children if you'll make yourself available say God take me somewhere I want to know more about you you all know who said that brother Wade last Sunday okay Matthew 21 and then when the disciples saw it they marveled saying how soon is a fig tree whether Jesus answered said to them but I say unto you if you have faith and doubting on you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed be thou cast of The Sea it shall be done in all things whatsoever you should ask him forever believe in you shall receive faith is our Victory and faith is a victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil faith is a victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that and that's the victory what is the victory say my arm is still crippled but faith is a victory I still feel sick but faith is a victory it overcomes the world when you can climb into God by prayer until you see the thing conquered unto you there is nothing that can hurt you then you've overcome you've got 50 miles of Elbow Room that's brother Aaron also quoted that the other night you're still you're sailing free then now that's probably all I'm going to get to of my PowerPoint probably the rest of this will take my illustration here and y'all really pray for me because I have a thought that I really want to get to y'all I really hope I don't run out of time on this so the other day as well as last month I went on a flight I took mercy and I've uh up to walk a mountain which is a mountain between kind of between Cleveland and Gainesville and we live close to walk a mountain I've lived close to walking mountain since I was a little since I was about two years old I've always lived within about 10 or 20 miles I've watched it my whole life I went to walk around that elementary school it's just always been a part of my life so I thought I'll take our girls and we'll do a little sightseeing we'll fly over and walk them out and then over our house then the next amount that took our other two Harmony and EULA flew them over the mountain same and over our house but there was a big difference between the two times we went the first time it was sunset and it was just overbearing so much light it was blinding and the Mist over the mountains around walk a mountain and all these mountains all around were just obscured from my view I didn't even notice them I knew they were there but I didn't even notice them and we're just taking pictures and videos then we went back and landed the next time I said where'd all these mountains come from because all of a sudden it was overcast it was raining a little bit when we got around the back side what I called the backside walk them out on the side opposite from the view of our house it was kind of rain and honest and it was clouds and all of a sudden we could see really clear for miles and miles around okay and I saw all these other mountains and I didn't hardly notice walk them out now I'm looking at all these other mountains in this range of I guess North Georgia Mountain Blue Ridge Mountains whatever all the mountains they were and I thought wow there's something to this so I went back and looked at the video and I figured out why it was because there's too much lights on that first flight so I said well there's something spiritual about that too if you think about it there's a lot of symbology in that when you come to faith in Christ at the very beginning when you believe you've come into a place remember I'll talk beginning about faith being a place you've come into this place and there's all these mountains but at the beginning you cannot see them because they're shrouded in unbelief all you see at the very beginning because that mist of sin all you see is maybe one mountain justification and if you keep around that one mountain long enough walk a mountain by the way is named after a man named Walker his last name was Walker if you think about walking as a Christian Journey you have to keep walking right you start believing in faith justification that mount justification you come to that first Mountain just keep on around that until you see Mountain sanctification come into view when you see that mountain now you've got two mountains in this whole big place called Faith there's a lot more out there that you don't see but you keep on going on this journey and you come to Mountain baptism the Holy Spirit you'll come to mount stature perfect man you come to mount uh you know faith for for Divine Healing for anything you have need of everything you have need of an Earth's Journey has given you when you're born again but you have to drink and push out just keep on going on this journey and walking is reading the bottom praying every day it's coming to churches listening to sermons keep on that journey and you'll see these other mountains coming to view I had no hope it looked like as a Baptist kid when I was 12 and gave my heart to the Lord came to that mount justification all I saw was walk a mountain I just kept walking and then one day I started reading my Bible every day and all of a sudden I came to sanctification the washing Water by the word I saw Mount sanctification come into view I kept going and I saw Mount baptism the holy spirit in 2015 and I kept going and I had no idea about this message that laid up ahead of me down the road you know in 2002. that was long on my journey and and all these other mountains you don't know what kind of mountains you're going to come to in your journey there's mountains of Victory mountains of uh Revelation Mountain well each one of these is really a revelation but there's all these little mountains of overcoming depression and lust and and fear and and anxiety and all these other kind of mountains these Mountain Top experiences you have but ironically the thing that kept me at the beginning at this first flight from seeing those mountains was the light the sunlight was overbearing and God knows how much light you can handle at one time so he gives you just a little at a time but that light was blind to me and it was obscuring the view of the mountains so I couldn't see him but if I once I when I kept going I could see there's other things come into view just keep these type of things in mind as we're y'all can play the sound I don't know that'll work if they can't get the sound going that's okay but that's me and mercy and I've on that first flight also I'll mention too last Sunday brother John Durant mentioned patiently waiting on God's timing oh yeah gotcha thank you what's up if y'all don't get it going it's no problem it's no big deal I can just keep talking over it because you'll still get the point just from watching it but mountains are symbolic of permanent things because you know that anytime you think of a mountain you think of something permanent something big and solid it's always going to be there until someone has Faith to move mountains you know it's always going to be standing right there you know you can always rely that that mountain is going to be in the same spot every time you look in that same area and when you have all these permanent things that justification of mine in when I was 12 was permanent I knew when I gave my heart to the Lord at 12 I'm going all the way with the Lord I'm never going to stop if I live to be 100 years old I'm still going to be serving Christ I knew that as a little Baptist kid not knowing about everything that laid my journey not knowing that I come to the message not no one that I come to something called sanctification that was not even in my psyche there was there's nobody even taught that in the Baptist Church they said just plead the blood you can't help what you do just plead the blood which literally means just keep messing up keep doing the wrong things you do cussing whatever else you do wrong just plead the blood ask God to forgive you you'll be all right but that was that first flight and there's you can kind of see the form the shape of the mountains off in the Horizon but you can't see them clearly as we could on this next flight and then we started on that next flight though it was cloudy though it was even raining at times we got on the back side of the mountain like this back side of the desert experience and all of a sudden these other mountains came into Clear View that was used to flying the plane and while that's still going I'll go and start talk about this most important one I want to get to is Mountain Divine Healing I came to mount Divine Healing somewhere in about 2015 or 2016. most of you don't well maybe some of you've heard a little bit over the years uh I've battled on and off with ulcerative colitis which is ulcers in the colon bleeding ulcers and in 2015 I had the worst episode of it ever and I didn't as far as I recall if I did anything at all here I'll probably turn in prayer requests like an unspoken I learned a long time ago faith for Divine Healing is basically two things you believe in your heart confess with your mouth and both those are to me are equally important so uh I wouldn't go around whining and complaining and even telling anybody my my mindset has always been on just keep my mouth shut about it I'm just if anything I might say pray for me I'm having a problem but I'm not going to talk about all the circumstances and I'm going to do my best to act like I'm Healed until my body agrees with it and uh when I listened to brother Brandon for the 40th time talk about brother John Ryan finally it quickened to me and the sort of the Mist of my own belief rolled away and I saw him out healing like I'd never seen her before Mount Divine Healing in plain view all of a sudden I realized was you believe God no matter what no matter what happens no matter how low you get you keep believing God and stand there in faith and believe in God no matter what and don't confess the circumstances John Ryan come up for prayer about being blind and he went away and he was brother Banner said you're healed and he went away and still couldn't see so he came back to the Altar and said I thought you said I was healed mother Banner said I thought you said you believed when that was quick in the draw and run he went away and also and started confessing it until it happened and I believe he would have confessed it his eyes never came open because he had the Revelation that it's a long-range Vision you see that you're healed even if your body don't declare it no matter what happens you see that you're healed and you accept it and you believe it no matter what and um then brother Banner himself had that stomach ailment that was terrible he was living on a liquid diet finally said well I'd rather die you know if I want to eat solid food if it kills me basically I think is what he said on one place I heard him say so he started installing food and the doctor told him it would kill him he did it anyway and it tried to come back up and he swallowed it back down and came back up and he swallowed it back down so finally somebody said how you doing brother man he said I'm doing well you know praise the Lord for helping me or whatever and he kept acting like he was healed even though his body didn't didn't say that that he was healed but yet he acted like he was healed and I had a similar thing with this uh one of these episodes of leading ulcers losing a lot of blood and even being basically borderline anemic weak and feverish and everything else and not saying a word anybody here the only one that knew it was Gabby and um I wouldn't say a word to anybody I'd just keep confessing that I'm Healed and now I'm perfectly fine not not a symptom at all but I won't stop if it shows up again tomorrow I'll still be sailing thank you Lord for healing me very soon obviously I have sister Freight on my mind a lot so um just keep her in mind that's why I mentioned that is for mostly for her and um we're all standing with her in prayer that's the first flight that shows you just how much the mountains and everything was obscured by that by that uh mist and the sun lighten it up and everything turn your musicians can go ahead and come up and the second flight there still was missed over the mountains but we could still see him because the sun was not shining them so bright so when you're going through those cloudy days and even some rain just know that God has a plan he has a purpose for all of that he's got this all in control he knows what he's doing God bless y'all thank you thank you [Music]
