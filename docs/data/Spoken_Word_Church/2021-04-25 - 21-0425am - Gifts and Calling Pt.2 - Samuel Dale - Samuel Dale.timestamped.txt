[13:48] lord would reach down into us and that
[13:50] way our
[13:51] all of our names are called it's all
[13:53] into that okay
[13:54] all right so we're going to romans 11
[13:57] and then we'll
[13:58] go to uh psalms 68
[14:02] all right so we go to romans 11 and and
[14:05] pick up our
[14:06] a couple of scriptures we want to deal
[14:08] with and then going into our thought
[14:12] father we thank you for this day and

[14:15] things
[14:16] thank you for your love and to us and
[14:18] lord we pray that you would just bless
[14:20] and guide each one

[14:23] us together rest
[14:25] sister collins and all of the little
[14:27] group there from
[14:29] from lincolnton lord and just be with
[14:31] them and be with our brother as he's
[14:33] starting out into the ministry and young
[14:35] and all
[14:36] but lord he can be used if he'll just
[14:38] follow you
[14:40] he may not think he's got anything but
[14:42] he if he can put it in your hands
[14:44] it can turn out to be a lot of doing and
[14:47] he can direct the family along in
[14:49] the things of life lord we pray you're
[14:52] just blessed forgive our sins
[14:54] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[14:56] remember the sick and just have your way
[14:58] in jesus name
[15:00] amen it's going to be kind of a
[15:03] odd part to take but you just bear with
[15:06] us
[15:06] and uh so we're going to romans where
[15:08] we've been reading and we'll just read
[15:10] verse 29 of
[15:11] romans 11 and it says for the gifts
[15:16] now what's gifts plural
[15:20] all right and calling singular
[15:26] there's just really one calling all are
[15:27] called by the same blood of jesus christ
[15:30] the same
[15:31] atonements etc but there's many gifts
[15:35] in the body of christ all right
[15:38] so for the gifts and callings of god are
[15:41] without
[15:42] repentance you don't have to repent to
[15:45] get a gift
[15:46] see that's where brother brown said he
[15:48] differed with the uh i believe it was a
[15:50] ladder rain brethren or something
[15:52] but he said that they believed he laying
[15:54] on the hands for gifts and things
[15:55] he said that's not true he said you're
[15:58] born with a gift
[16:00] it's not doesn't come by laying on the
[16:02] hands
[16:03] that stirs up the gift what is it the
[16:06] scripture says are you know the
[16:08] the gift that was in thee from thy
[16:10] grandmother coming well the gift wasn't
[16:12] from grandmother
[16:14] the gift was the faith of the
[16:16] grandmother applied coming down until
[16:19] when it
[16:19] did she just would lay hands on
[16:23] and i believe in we ordained ministers
[16:26] we ordained deacons etc because we
[16:30] believe in it i believe in laying on
[16:32] hand the prophet believed in that
[16:33] but not believing of laying on our hands
[16:35] to give you a gift
[16:37] but to stir up the gift that's already
[16:41] there
[16:42] from god himself because that's the only
[16:43] one that's worth anything
[16:45] all right so now let's go to psalms
[16:49] 68 i may have put these in backwards to
[16:52] them but
[16:53] we'll get it anyway
[17:00] psalm 68 verse 18. and watch
[17:03] now this is the old testament looking
[17:06] forward
[17:08] so that's you know my point was what on
[17:11] the live
[17:12] service we went backward we go back into
[17:14] the mind of god we talk about the gifts
[17:17] and the callings et cetera
[17:19] and believing it and then we keep on to
[17:22] our reach our destiny
[17:24] because that's what we believe in what
[17:26] you are predestinated
[17:28] by foreknowledge not that god desired
[17:32] anybody to be lost etc
[17:34] he desired all to be saved but he
[17:37] predestinated by his foreknowledge
[17:41] all right see then if you have a gift
[17:44] within you
[17:45] we're not going to pray for you to uh
[17:48] necessarily
[17:49] work that gift we pray that god will
[17:52] anoint you
[17:54] and he can take care of those things and
[17:56] and we do it in that style because
[17:58] that's the way
[17:59] all right see what
[18:02] thou has ascended on high
[18:06] thou hast led captivity captive
[18:09] thou hast received gifts for men
[18:13] yea for the rebellious also
[18:19] that the lord god might dwell among you
[18:23] now go over to ephesians 4
[18:27] while you're doing it i'll say this word
[18:29] about it think about it
[18:31] now remember the prophet says everybody
[18:37] i gave it to you last week we'll go back
[18:39] through it everybody
[18:41] is born with a gift of some kind
[18:45] because you're a human being
[18:48] all right you have a gift
[18:51] it may be to sow or cook or
[18:56] work on cars or whatever but god can
[18:58] take that
[18:59] and activate it as we'll go through the
[19:02] message
[19:03] and bring it out to being worth
[19:06] something
[19:07] all right but see all the way back there
[19:09] now the psalmist
[19:12] looking forward to calvary
[19:16] and he says thou has to send it on high
[19:19] we know what that's for huh thou hast
[19:21] led captivity captive
[19:24] thou has received gifts for men see
[19:26] receive
[19:29] if you receive something there's got to
[19:30] be somebody to give it
[19:32] all right so then gifts and callings of
[19:36] god
[19:38] give some calling of god
[19:42] all right but for the rebellious
[19:45] why because everybody has a gift art
[19:48] ephesians
[19:50] i don't remember where did i put that on
[19:51] there for him to use it but
[19:53] you know we'll get to that point okay
[19:56] ephesians
[19:57] 4 well to every one of us is given grace
[20:01] according to the measure
[20:03] of the gift of christ wherefore he saith
[20:08] when he ascended up on high he led
[20:10] captivity captive
[20:12] and gave gifts unto men right back to
[20:14] the psalmist telling you what's taking
[20:16] place
[20:18] now that he ascended what is it but that
[20:20] he also descended first into the lower
[20:23] parts of the earth
[20:24] he that descended is the same also that
[20:26] ascended up far
[20:28] above all heavens that he might
[20:32] fill all things
[20:36] now talk about gifts now watch what he
[20:39] says
[20:41] and he gave some
[20:44] they said about gifts now he gave some
[20:48] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[20:52] some pastors some teachers for the
[20:55] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[20:58] the ministry
[20:59] for the edifying of the body of christ
[21:01] till we all come into the unity of the
[21:03] faith
[21:04] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[21:05] unto a perfect man
[21:07] unto the measure of the stature of the
[21:09] fullness of christ you may be seated the
[21:11] lord that is
[21:12] blessing to the reading of the word
[21:15] i want you to keep in mind
[21:21] what we will be dealing with for a while
[21:23] and i'll keep repeating it because i
[21:25] want you to understand what i'm talking
[21:27] about
[21:29] then you can decide whether or not you
[21:31] believe that
[21:33] that's left up to you but see
[21:36] if we can believe the word of god then
[21:39] all things are possible to them that
[21:41] believe
[21:42] so why are we concerned about anything
[21:44] i'm not concerned about
[21:45] missing it or something why because god
[21:47] already even back a psalmist even back
[21:50] there
[21:50] the psalmist david saw i mean
[21:54] you know in the dave psalmist david in
[21:56] his
[21:57] speaking he would say he led captivity
[22:00] he's looking forward as i said to
[22:01] calvary
[22:03] and he's saying even the rebellious
[22:07] well you mean god would deal with
[22:09] rebellious people
[22:11] i thank god he's always dealt with us
[22:14] you know we didn't all come into the
[22:16] world being too good of a
[22:17] background right but he's
[22:21] he'll promised it all right
[22:24] so he said it back there he said he
[22:26] would give gifts he received gifts
[22:31] all right now here he says that he's
[22:34] going to give
[22:35] gifts to the church and he names it and
[22:40] names the fivefold ministry
[22:43] all right then he says and that fivefold
[22:46] ministry
[22:47] is for the perfecting
[22:50] of the saints
[22:54] right see it's got the answer to it he
[22:58] he's he's got it all set out for us
[23:02] but we've got to to follow the right way
[23:04] now the prophet said
[23:05] that this way he said ever how you treat
[23:09] the ministry
[23:10] is the way you're treating god
[23:16] you honor the ministry god will honor
[23:17] you you dishonor the ministry he'll
[23:20] he'll dishonor you but he'll also do one
[23:23] thing
[23:25] he'll take out the ministry
[23:30] come on go to the church age book and
[23:32] pick up where your prophet shows it
[23:35] how that he would take out he will take
[23:37] away your minister
[23:41] well you say well we've got a lot of
[23:42] that we're in the days where there's a
[23:43] lot of preachers doing this out of there
[23:45] we've got a lot of we're in a day when
[23:47] we've got a lot of people that's gone
[23:48] this way or the other
[23:52] but that ain't got nothing to do with me
[23:53] and you mean you better be concerned
[23:56] what we're doing here
[23:58] in our little assembly and what we're
[24:00] gathered for in
[24:01] the things you know to be able to put
[24:03] our part
[24:04] and see everybody has a part
[24:07] we are the body of christ correct
[24:11] and being the body of christ each
[24:13] individual has something to do
[24:18] well i don't have nothing to do brother
[24:20] dale uh i i've sit here for years and
[24:22] nobody's told me what to do
[24:25] well listen
[24:29] gifts are without repentance
[24:34] so you don't repent to get a gift
[24:37] so it's not you come up to the front
[24:39] here and say brother they'll lay hands
[24:41] on me
[24:43] then i get a gift to help the church
[24:48] it wouldn't work anyway come on am i
[24:51] right with the prophet the way he said
[24:53] it
[24:53] he said if you volunteer to do something
[24:56] you've got a lot of problems but if god
[24:58] has to run you
[25:00] down and knock you down
[25:03] you'll be used that's way what he
[25:06] said when he came to me and he said
[25:09] daddy
[25:10] i got something i want to talk to you
[25:12] about
[25:14] i said you don't want to talk to me
[25:18] he said you know what i'm talking about
[25:20] i said i've known what you're talking
[25:21] about for many years
[25:22] just waiting on you i said if you don't
[25:24] believe me go ask your mother
[25:26] that i told her we would that you would
[25:29] be coming back to the lord
[25:33] not only that that you would be right
[25:34] here standing beside of me
[25:38] as a minister in this church i told her
[25:42] that two or three years before wade came
[25:43] back
[25:44] or many years before and we believed it
[25:47] and accepted it well see then he said
[25:50] what to do what do you want to say i do
[25:51] i said run ask him
[25:56] you know how it would be with most
[25:57] ministers in this message if their son
[26:00] come up
[26:00] and said well i've got i i believe i'm
[26:03] called
[26:04] daddy you think i want to go to prison
[26:06] oh yes sir you're called we're going to
[26:08] put you right in here
[26:09] no i said uh i said run
[26:13] i said run until he runs you down
[26:18] i said run until you can't run no more
[26:22] then when you do i said because the
[26:24] prophet said if you volunteer for
[26:26] something
[26:27] you won't never do it right but if you
[26:28] if it's not then you'll find
[26:30] it'll work he came to me one day and he
[26:34] said
[26:35] because i didn't tell him about the part
[26:37] of the ministry
[26:39] when that was first happened i told him
[26:41] about the lord showing him coming back
[26:43] and he he come back and you know and he
[26:45] told me he said well well daddy said i
[26:47] feel like
[26:47] this i said yeah that's part of what the
[26:49] lord showed me you'd be standing beside
[26:51] him in the ministry
[26:54] all right see why because i believe in
[26:57] gifts and callings as being without
[26:59] repentance you don't
[27:00] you don't repent you don't you don't
[27:02] volunteer for a gift
[27:04] not in the bible now where everything
[27:06] else you got gifts you give people
[27:08] but not in the bible terminologies
[27:12] in the bible terminologies you've got
[27:15] uh things that are odd being said
[27:19] that you have to have sometimes help
[27:21] breaking it down
[27:22] to be able to comprehend what's being
[27:25] said
[27:26] all right and see then that way gifts
[27:29] and calling
[27:32] but he says make your calling an
[27:35] election sure
[27:40] brother up in tennessee years ago he had
[27:42] backslidden things and
[27:45] he's telling me he's one day that
[27:49] he said how is it i get i still get
[27:51] messages
[27:54] he said i know i'm backslid i know i'm
[27:57] not right with god
[27:59] we said i still get messages just like i
[28:02] did i said that's the gift
[28:06] he said that has nothing to do with you
[28:08] that's the gift
[28:09] the gift is still there it'll always be
[28:11] there because the gift comes from god
[28:14] now the psalmist said it did because he
[28:16] said he received gifts for men
[28:20] did you catch the way he said it no
[28:21] psalm it was for men in other words
[28:24] future tense
[28:28] huh then when he comes up here to
[28:31] ephesians then he just lays it out what
[28:34] it is
[28:36] all right see then that's what we need
[28:39] to understand
[28:40] and to make sure we don't forget think
[28:43] about this
[28:46] see gifts there's many gifts
[28:52] everybody has a gift of some kind
[28:55] a natural gift you have natural gifts
[28:59] that you come into the world you can do
[29:01] things that other people can't do
[29:02] right
[29:06] you you can do something that other
[29:08] people just they just can't do it they
[29:09] just go haywire trying to figure it out
[29:11] why because it's a gift all right it's a
[29:15] natural gift
[29:17] okay now that's great to be that way but
[29:21] what about when god can take
[29:23] that gift and
[29:26] activate it for the gospel
[29:31] right take your your gift
[29:35] activate it he can that's what they said
[29:38] you know laying on the hands
[29:40] see they got confused about it it's not
[29:42] laying on hands to get a gift
[29:43] it's laying on the hands to activate the
[29:46] gift
[29:47] or to bring the gift alive
[29:51] you see then you can use it you know
[29:54] that brother branham said
[29:55] that every church would be responsible
[29:58] for what they do with the gifts
[30:03] oh but we don't believe in gifts we
[30:05] don't we don't believe in speaking in
[30:06] tongues shouting and crying to
[30:08] show me where it was took out of the
[30:09] bible
[30:11] i'll show you where it was put in you
[30:14] showed me where it was took out
[30:16] not so it's there
[30:20] and if we don't use it we'll have to
[30:22] give an account
[30:26] so then that's what we're trying to say
[30:28] there last sunday
[30:30] about it that even your natural life
[30:34] you have gifts
[30:37] in things knowledge and and
[30:40] and different things you know
[30:42] understanding and and things you have
[30:44] wisdom
[30:45] and you have many many gifts all right
[30:50] that can be in a person and you can do
[30:53] you can that gift can be operating
[30:55] before you ever
[30:56] even start the fact of being born again
[31:02] you get somebody that's kind of like
[31:04] myself i you'd never think it but
[31:08] when i was up to about 16 years of age i
[31:11] was so bashful until
[31:13] uh i would not look at you when you were
[31:15] talking to me
[31:18] where is i now because i just couldn't
[31:21] do it i
[31:22] i was too biased full well
[31:26] i began to try to get rid of that and i
[31:28] thought well my goodness now
[31:29] why am i supposed to be bicycle i'm just
[31:33] as good as they are i'm
[31:34] i'm come out of the same dirt everybody
[31:37] else comes
[31:38] and that's the only thing that i've ever
[31:39] tried to teach my kids or anything
[31:42] teach them to be what they're supposed
[31:43] to be
[31:45] put forth their gifts if they could play
[31:48] balls
[31:48] play ball you know if they could
[31:52] learn to work on cars learn to work on
[31:55] cars
[31:57] whatever it was some natural part of
[32:00] your life would fall in line
[32:02] and you'd see it would just be an
[32:03] automatic process
[32:06] well you know what being a christian
[32:10] is an automatic process
[32:14] you remember how we were trying to bring
[32:15] it out at least you'd cover three stages
[32:18] of the fact that you do it
[32:19] that there's gifts of the natural
[32:24] that you have gifts in your life you was
[32:26] able to do things in your
[32:28] life that other people were not able to
[32:29] do all right
[32:31] then you come into the christian realm
[32:33] and you got nine spiritual gifts
[32:38] all right second corinthians covers
[32:41] whatever 12-13
[32:43] it covers the gifts
[32:46] there's many gifts and see the holy
[32:48] spirit can come on you
[32:50] and activate a natural gift
[32:54] giving you the new birth and turn that
[32:57] into a
[32:58] spiritual heavenly understanding
[33:03] and put that gift to work
[33:07] then you can see that the people you
[33:09] know you you say well well
[33:10] it just come to me where to and i have
[33:12] discernment
[33:14] i i just you know the lord's showing me
[33:17] things well praise god
[33:22] praise god then let that act be
[33:24] activated
[33:26] like i said i was so bashful until then
[33:28] it was just
[33:29] pitiful you wouldn't think that now for
[33:32] nothing in the world
[33:33] because you see i turned that around to
[33:36] where
[33:37] it would i would not be the bashful part
[33:41] and started working upon those natural
[33:43] things
[33:44] well see then when i become born again
[33:46] then it was easy to step into line
[33:50] you know a point and and at 18 at uh
[33:53] 23 years of age i was a deacon in the
[33:56] baptist church
[33:58] they saw the gifts with their the the
[34:01] things that
[34:01] you know that i had understanding of the
[34:03] scriptures that i had things that
[34:05] you know they enjoyed it and when i quit
[34:08] the baptist church i had to resign from
[34:10] about five offices
[34:11] that i was was working in and one of
[34:14] them was teaching the adult
[34:16] sunday school class which was the
[34:18] deacons and elders and their wives the
[34:20] adults
[34:22] that was what i was doing and i was only
[34:24] in my 20s
[34:26] you know you don't know this see but
[34:29] you asked somebody to say how was you
[34:31] when you become a deacon
[34:33] 40. how was you what you're 50.
[34:37] you just don't you you wouldn't back
[34:39] there it might be changed now
[34:41] but back there you didn't become a
[34:42] deacon at 23 years of age you understand
[34:45] they saw there was something about it
[34:49] that they even went into that
[34:52] and ordained me a deacon i was was well
[34:55] thought of in the
[34:56] reference realms or the the baptist
[34:58] ranks i could go to the
[35:00] to the to the meetings i could do why
[35:03] because
[35:03] i had got rid of that natural thing and
[35:06] come to the
[35:07] to the point of believing the new birth
[35:09] as far as i could understand
[35:12] i put it that way for correctly because
[35:14] i didn't claim the new birth at that
[35:16] point
[35:17] but as much as i could understand but it
[35:18] began to develop into the point that
[35:21] god could use me into doing things and
[35:24] you know you'd have to come in up in the
[35:26] ranks with us
[35:27] but then the baptist said pretty well
[35:29] give like wade's a sunday school for the
[35:30] teachers
[35:31] they'd give him a book to go by
[35:35] and stories in the book and you you you
[35:37] know everybody had to
[35:39] lay out according to that well they gave
[35:41] them to me and i just laid it down
[35:45] and when i'd started i'd just start
[35:46] talking to the people
[35:48] you know you remember how i told you the
[35:50] other day about brother gary atkins you
[35:52] know when he told me he said
[35:53] i i i they want me to be a
[35:56] teacher a sunday school team but i can't
[35:59] teach
[36:00] i said it was ever very easy because
[36:02] brother gary had already passed over he
[36:04] wasn't in the bicycle stages
[36:06] he's beyond all of that he was he was
[36:08] you know
[36:09] i said just read romans 1
[36:12] and start talking
[36:17] he came back three or four weeks later
[36:19] and he said
[36:20] i said how's it going he said i ain't
[36:23] got out of romans 1 yet i said i've
[36:26] tried to tell you that if you'll just
[36:27] let god just yield to him
[36:29] then the gift will come to working
[36:32] because there's
[36:33] nine spiritual gifts that are in the
[36:35] body of christ that you're not even
[36:37] talking about
[36:38] five full ministry and things we're
[36:39] having that's why i'm having to divide
[36:41] that
[36:42] and put it as natural gifts
[36:46] and then for you to think about then let
[36:48] god come and give you a new birth
[36:50] and then let that start activating that
[36:53] natural gift
[36:54] and bringing it into understanding that
[36:57] it can be used
[37:00] and then maybe one day you might be
[37:02] called to be a minister
[37:04] all right and see that's
[37:08] that's the the things that we need to
[37:11] understand
[37:12] i've tried to explain the fifo ministry
[37:14] to the people of this message
[37:16] and and i've had so much trouble with it
[37:18] until i finally got where i said forget
[37:21] it i just won't try to explain what i
[37:23] see
[37:24] but the bible said he gave some apostles
[37:27] some prophets
[37:29] some pastors some teachers
[37:33] you know what and i found one the other
[37:35] day where the prophet said it
[37:36] he said he give you what you have need
[37:38] of
[37:40] he said some people need a pastor
[37:44] some people need a teacher i mean you've
[37:47] told me that from your own words you
[37:49] know well brother dale i i like the way
[37:51] you do because i like a teacher
[37:53] but some others go you know maybe even
[37:55] leave the church or whatever because
[37:57] they didn't understand what that is and
[37:59] they'd rather have an evangelist
[38:04] well
[38:07] that could be part of the doing but get
[38:10] what i'm
[38:10] talking about see you have natural gifts
[38:13] that can work on into the rest of your
[38:15] life and work and
[38:16] and you become to where that you can god
[38:19] can activate those things
[38:21] and then there's nine spiritual gifts in
[38:23] the the body of christ
[38:25] in the church and those nine spiritual
[38:28] gifts brought around
[38:29] use it up now listen to the wording he
[38:32] uses the nine spiritual gifts and says
[38:34] they are for the perfecting of the
[38:36] saints
[38:38] see then the bible comes on over and
[38:40] picks up the fifo ministry
[38:42] and said it's for the perfecting of the
[38:44] science
[38:48] and you remember how the gifts they are
[38:49] in
[38:51] see there's a lot of difference between
[38:52] a a prophet and a gift of prophecy
[38:57] there's a lot of difference in wisdom
[39:01] knowledge and things of those things
[39:03] that are in the gifts
[39:04] right go to rome go to first corinthians
[39:07] or second corinthians
[39:09] about 12 and 13 and study the gifts
[39:12] because paul then turns around and says
[39:15] desire
[39:17] the most earnest gift or the best
[39:21] see he wasn't satisfied for the people
[39:23] to just sit down with a gift i'm not
[39:25] satisfied with that
[39:27] i've had people to tell me so brother
[39:28] dale i believe i have a gift i said
[39:30] don't worry about it i won't set you
[39:31] down
[39:32] but you know what i'm talking about some
[39:34] of the preachers in this message
[39:35] you'd start doing it and man they just
[39:38] shut you down and tell you to shut up
[39:40] because they don't believe in the gifts
[39:41] well i believe in all of the gifts
[39:44] i believe in the nine spiritual gifts
[39:50] i believe in the in in those things but
[39:52] i believe that they are without
[39:54] a calling like we think they are
[39:57] you can't practice it or work it up
[40:00] well we'll send him to school
[40:04] now you see why the prophet was against
[40:05] that he said we'll send him to school
[40:12] we'll we'll let him go to school and
[40:14] learn how to be a preacher
[40:16] now how are you going to learn how to be
[40:17] a preacher
[40:21] well you can learn how to be him like
[40:22] most people are
[40:25] because they're not a god called
[40:26] preacher they're just a preacher
[40:30] but see you can't do that you even the
[40:32] gifts
[40:34] of the nine spiritual gifts the prophet
[40:38] said you can prophesy one time that gift
[40:40] can operate on you and you prophesy one
[40:42] time and he said never use you again
[40:48] now that's a gift in the body of christ
[40:53] that you can have a wisdom knowledge
[40:56] and things to go into the love joy peace
[40:58] go into to help working
[41:00] into the stature of a perfect man
[41:02] because that's how it works
[41:03] for these virtues to come into the body
[41:05] of christ you need help a lot of times
[41:07] all right that's to help
[41:08] that even just to nine spiritual gifts
[41:12] work in that to help
[41:16] see all right but you understand what
[41:20] i'm getting at see then you have the
[41:22] gifts
[41:25] well you're going to be responsible for
[41:26] not using it
[41:28] but brother dale i'm afraid of well what
[41:30] do you think i'm doing i'm having to
[41:31] stand up here before the whole
[41:32] congregation
[41:35] i'm having to leave myself open to
[41:37] everybody in the building
[41:39] to say if you don't agree with me come
[41:41] and tell me
[41:43] show me where i miss it all right
[41:49] but you see what i'm getting at see you
[41:50] got the natural gifts
[41:52] of life god can move that over into a
[41:56] realm
[41:56] and putting you in the new birth and
[41:58] putting you in the body of christ
[42:00] and activate those gifts that way that
[42:03] you'll wind up to be what he wants you
[42:05] to be in the
[42:06] in the nine spiritual gifts that's in
[42:08] the body
[42:10] right
[42:13] and it'll work me
[42:19] you know i wish i could sing i'm like
[42:21] brother brown
[42:22] that's one of those things that i wish i
[42:23] could do if i could sing like some of
[42:26] you can
[42:27] michael gets up here i won't punch him
[42:29] in the nose
[42:31] why because he just flows
[42:35] aaron he just it just you know you just
[42:37] flow
[42:40] well why i can't do that because in a
[42:43] minute
[42:44] i'm going to go ah you know it's up and
[42:46] down and running out somewhere
[42:49] i can base a little bit you know sang a
[42:52] little bit on that line
[42:55] but i wish i could sing to the glory of
[42:57] god
[43:02] i honor like george beverly shea i
[43:04] believe is his name
[43:06] with billy graham he had a marvelous
[43:08] voice
[43:09] i mean it was just marvelous that the
[43:12] man could sing
[43:15] for the glory of the lord
[43:18] but you get what i'm talking about see
[43:20] god can work with you
[43:22] in what you've got don't worry about
[43:24] trying to volunteer
[43:26] it
[43:30] the bible says for us to wait on our
[43:31] gifts
[43:36] don't go out and jump out and run like
[43:37] everything with it
[43:39] you know maybe i shouldn't say it but
[43:43] i'm just human enough and i try to get
[43:45] points across to you that
[43:46] i don't want to hurt your feelings but i
[43:48] know i do but if you ever notice people
[43:50] that can't sing
[43:51] they're going to sing four verses out of
[43:53] the song they're gonna
[43:54] they're gonna pick us and it's only got
[43:57] three verses
[43:57] and there's one with four
[44:03] that's dirty but is it true
[44:08] right see at least i tell you i'm
[44:11] straight i'm honest about it
[44:12] i sit there sometimes and say well hey
[44:14] take off verse 4.
[44:18] because you hadn't got verse one right
[44:20] yet
[44:23] i know that's accurate but it'll make
[44:27] you practice
[44:30] practice your gift work on it
[44:34] put it to work see
[44:38] you know what i'm talking about some
[44:39] people are just we
[44:41] always call it wrong and do it but we
[44:43] always say that brother or sister one
[44:44] got a gift to gab
[44:46] it's always been said about aaron but i
[44:48] won't never call it that way you know
[44:51] but aaron could walk he could stand out
[44:54] there and talk to a power pole all day
[44:55] long
[44:59] you say you're going oh no that's a gift
[45:03] he can do it he can talk to things he
[45:05] can do things
[45:07] but see i want it to be for porn for
[45:08] nothing else for us to see that god
[45:10] wants
[45:11] what he wants to take what we've got but
[45:13] he wants to
[45:14] activate that and continually just keep
[45:16] activating him
[45:19] all right because you got the natural
[45:21] gifts all right then you've got the
[45:22] nine spiritual gifts in the body of
[45:24] christ that god can use those gifts
[45:28] but that don't mean you're a preacher
[45:31] that's where the problem with people
[45:32] they get a calling in their life
[45:34] to move up a little bit and as they do
[45:38] and i knew this in the baptist church
[45:40] because i i believed it and i've always
[45:41] taught it since coming out
[45:44] see you get people that
[45:47] they just they have a gift but they just
[45:50] won't go on with it
[45:52] then you got the others that that don't
[45:53] have no gifts they're the ones that want
[45:55] to go
[45:56] if you could ever get them straight you
[45:59] know
[46:00] in other words you use what you're doing
[46:02] okay all right
[46:04] see then activate the gift
[46:08] and you may speak in tongues you may
[46:10] shout you may cry you may do all things
[46:13] and have all kind of gifts but it may
[46:15] never be used but one time
[46:20] you say well i used to do this and i
[46:21] used to do that but i just
[46:23] i just ain't doing it no more now you
[46:25] know what you're gonna start doing
[46:26] you're gonna blame everybody around
[46:28] you well it ain't my fault i got a gift
[46:31] i can do it
[46:33] his brother telling me one time he said
[46:35] i can speak in tongues anytime i want to
[46:42] i said not according to the bible
[46:47] you can speak in tongues which is
[46:49] another language
[46:53] and i said that's what you've been doing
[46:54] you've been speaking in spanish
[46:56] and people are beginning to think that
[46:57] you're you're or something spiritual
[47:01] and i said you're doing that but i said
[47:02] that ain't what it is
[47:06] i hate it i had to say it because i just
[47:08] didn't agree i knew what he was doing
[47:09] and i didn't know a word of english i
[47:11] mean he
[47:11] worded spanish for him to tell him why
[47:13] but i knew that's what he was doing
[47:20] but take those gifts and and let god
[47:22] activate them
[47:26] and rejoice in doing those things
[47:29] and be part of the body of christ but
[47:31] see the the problem is
[47:33] is we all want to be a brother branham
[47:40] now i'm going to say something and i
[47:43] want you to just
[47:43] listen to what i'm saying because this
[47:45] will be the thought for the next couple
[47:47] of messages or
[47:48] for a while i know
[47:52] you've got the gifts it'll work natural
[47:54] gifts
[47:55] now you've got spiritual gifts in the
[47:57] nine spiritual gifts in the body of
[47:59] christ
[48:00] and they will work all right now you're
[48:03] coming up to word that we read
[48:05] and it says that he gave some apostles
[48:07] the prophets
[48:08] pastors all right we've got to nine come
[48:10] up from the
[48:11] from the gifts to the nine spiritual
[48:13] gifts and now come up to
[48:15] a fifo ministry
[48:20] right a fifo ministry
[48:26] then you've got a prophet like brother
[48:28] branham
[48:30] you got prophets in the bible you've got
[48:32] the agaves you've got the different ones
[48:35] and they can be used to bring things
[48:39] they could even tell peter or which one
[48:41] was it paul or peter
[48:42] that said you're going to be bound by
[48:44] this cloak and taken to
[48:46] rome the
[48:51] there's gifts that work
[48:56] all right and seeing that fivefold
[48:58] ministry gift is for the perfecting of
[49:00] the saints
[49:03] but then you've got the prophet's
[49:05] ministry
[49:07] that comes in malachi 4. that may i say
[49:11] it and mean it in the correct way
[49:14] brother branham
[49:18] tells us a prophet stands
[49:21] before no one
[49:25] now fightful ministry prophet we got to
[49:27] deal with that just a little bit because
[49:29] you got a little problem five full
[49:31] ministry profit ain't that the same as
[49:33] brother branham's gift brother branham
[49:35] could fulfill the whole 5-4 ministry
[49:39] because he was outside of the fifo
[49:42] ministry
[49:45] malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7
[49:48] is the word of god alive for the hour
[49:51] that we're living
[49:54] and he was the only one that could bring
[49:57] the word
[49:58] everybody else was to be be questioned
[50:01] or
[50:02] or are tested or checked to see
[50:06] but brother branham stood before no one
[50:09] that's why you can't do that even the
[50:11] basis i've tried to go this far
[50:14] when brother branham taught that the
[50:15] white horse rider was the antichrist
[50:20] i mean jesus christ when he taught that
[50:25] there was nobody to judge him
[50:29] clarence larkin taught it before then
[50:32] that the white horse rider was the
[50:33] antichrist
[50:34] before brother branham come along but
[50:36] yet he was not malachi 4.
[50:42] you say what do you think he's still
[50:43] riding a horse
[50:45] he couldn't get off the horse he was
[50:47] still riding the antichrist horse
[50:50] i'm talking about clarence larkin
[50:51] because he was still a denominational
[50:53] person
[50:54] that's why brother branham could not
[50:56] nobody could stand before him even
[50:58] though
[50:58] now watch him he said if you find me off
[51:00] in one thing
[51:01] he said i'm off in everything right you
[51:04] better get that straight
[51:09] you better back up from what you're
[51:10] doing there because you're correct
[51:12] correcting a prophet
[51:14] but that's what people's doing now
[51:16] they're saying well brother brian was
[51:17] wrong here in wrong guy
[51:19] there was nobody
[51:24] that could go before the prophet and get
[51:27] those seals
[51:30] you know go in advance into god or
[51:32] something
[51:33] in their own doing they couldn't do it
[51:36] it took the prophet to bring the word
[51:40] fifo ministry
[51:43] but there we'll get to that in the next
[51:45] message the fivefold ministry
[51:47] has got to line up with
[51:51] every word of the prophet
[51:56] we stand judged i preach
[51:59] as a judged minister that if i don't
[52:03] preach what the prophet preached
[52:05] i am condemned by my own
[52:08] words
[52:13] it would run around and said so-and-so
[52:15] and i don't believe that i believe it's
[52:16] this way
[52:18] go ahead
[52:21] just remember moses had the word of his
[52:26] day
[52:27] i don't care how many pharaohs there was
[52:30] moses didn't answer to nobody
[52:34] he didn't go out on the backside of the
[52:36] desert and try to find some
[52:39] other guy to help him out
[52:44] he stood on his arm
[52:47] you just think where that prophet stood
[52:50] he said
[52:51] you say what i say he says because i'll
[52:55] be
[52:56] judged now watch what i'm talking about
[52:59] while he was teaching the white horse
[53:01] rider
[53:03] as the holy ghost the word had
[53:06] not been unveiled yet
[53:11] so there was nobody
[53:15] oh yeah he listened to brother neville
[53:17] he listened to those brothers and said
[53:18] yeah i enjoyed that and got things
[53:20] he said he didn't get nothing i'm saying
[53:22] it the way i think i'm trying to
[53:23] get it right but yet there's nobody
[53:27] he stood before nobody he didn't have to
[53:29] answer to nobody
[53:31] he didn't have to go down to the pope to
[53:33] decide whether or not he could preach it
[53:34] like it was
[53:36] or any minister in the fifo ministry
[53:40] because there was no minister in the
[53:42] fifo ministry that could correct the
[53:43] prophet
[53:46] now you see why i'm so hard now with all
[53:49] these ministers and what they're doing
[53:51] with the message and how they're killing
[53:53] the message and destroying the very
[53:55] people
[53:56] that for years has believed the message
[53:58] and tried to stay with it and now
[54:00] they're just falling
[54:01] right in left this churches and things
[54:04] why because the preachers are trying to
[54:06] correct a prophet
[54:10] preachers you can't do that
[54:15] you can correct a congregation
[54:20] because that's your job but don't try
[54:24] to correct the prophet amen
[54:27] you say well the prophet said if i say
[54:29] one thing then you go
[54:30] you know i say well look at her
[54:34] he talked to a white horse rider wrong
[54:39] who could you judge it by
[54:43] you may not like that kind of language
[54:44] or thoughts i don't either
[54:46] but i like the truth right
[54:50] you can't correct a prophet
[54:55] he stands before god alone
[55:00] but then the fifo ministry we'll get to
[55:01] later
[55:03] you better be careful what you're doing
[55:05] with it
[55:07] well i don't have to have no preacher
[55:09] good and bye
[55:12] don't worry us don't worry yourself go
[55:15] home
[55:17] say oh you're tough ain't tough i'm just
[55:20] straight
[55:23] i just try to tell it like it is if you
[55:26] think you can straighten out brother
[55:27] branham's message
[55:28] we need to follow you i know
[55:31] 40 years ago i told them when they
[55:33] started doing those things i said would
[55:35] you do me one favor
[55:39] i said would you brothers that can do
[55:41] those things and straight and brother
[55:42] right around
[55:43] would you mind pulling off your shoes
[55:46] because i want to kiss your toe
[55:54] oh but brother dale that's that's being
[55:56] aggravating you're
[55:58] very nasty no no no no no
[56:01] you kiss the pope's toe you're declaring
[56:03] to be almighty god
[56:05] that's why brother branham would not do
[56:07] that
[56:10] right he said i'll do everything i can
[56:13] said they cut his pants off
[56:15] when he went before the king over there
[56:16] you know cut him and fixed him some way
[56:18] i don't understand what he'd done but he
[56:20] fixed him somewhere
[56:21] he volunteered for that he said and i'll
[56:23] call the pope brother
[56:28] he said but i will not kiss his toe
[56:33] my master is the only one that gets that
[56:38] what about a five-fold ministry then
[56:39] there's sitting down with her
[56:41] jinger jagger's little things little
[56:43] messages trying to hold people together
[56:44] and won't fight these things that's
[56:46] taking place in the message around the
[56:47] land
[56:55] it's time to stand up and say forget it
[56:59] but that was brother so-and-so now
[57:01] listen this is what gets me
[57:04] i i'm sorry i'm human
[57:07] what gets me is here comes somebody
[57:09] that's trying to straighten out the
[57:11] prophet
[57:14] in his message you know
[57:18] and they're the ones doing it but yet
[57:21] they claim that
[57:23] they are the leaders that take over
[57:27] well then what do you need brett around
[57:29] them for why don't you just step out on
[57:30] your own and say i'm god
[57:32] that's what i asked brother hansen one
[57:34] time about a certain place in this
[57:35] message and
[57:37] i said well this brother believes this
[57:38] is why i said what is that brother there
[57:40] believe he said he believes he's god
[57:42] i said well okay we got that straight
[57:48] so i have no reason to rally around
[57:50] something like that
[57:54] but you see the five-fold ministry has a
[57:56] great position
[58:01] i'll read these things later if the
[58:03] prophet had to say about it but
[58:05] just trying to get you to think
[58:10] the fivefold ministry stands now before
[58:12] the
[58:13] before god walking with the prophet's
[58:16] message
[58:18] do you understand what i'm saying we've
[58:20] got to
[58:21] walk with the prophet's message we can't
[58:23] have something
[58:24] that we think the prophet was wrong
[58:28] right we can't do it
[58:31] [Music]
[58:33] but see we use everything in the world
[58:35] to try to straighten out brother branham
[58:37] well then if i can straighten out
[58:39] brother branham i'm supposed to be god
[58:41] because that's the only one that i can
[58:43] find in the bible that's above that
[58:47] right i can't find no other big gift or
[58:50] some person or something
[58:52] that's supposed to come along and do all
[58:53] of these things
[58:55] so then that means that you're supposed
[58:57] i'm supposed to worship you
[59:01] well then you're just arrogant
[59:06] glory to god let me stay
[59:10] arrogant if it's the truth
[59:13] if it ain't then whack it and tell me i
[59:16] ain't telling the truth
[59:20] that's all i've ever said to the people
[59:22] of the message show me where i'm wrong
[59:26] we've been on the internet for how many
[59:28] years now
[59:30] right on the 20 i guess closer i
[59:32] remember exactly how long
[59:33] and it went worldwide well come and show
[59:37] me where i've missed the message
[59:42] oh but you don't believe this now show
[59:44] me where the prophet taught something
[59:46] that i don't believe
[59:50] okay but you see what i'm doing
[59:55] i'm showing where you and me both
[59:58] are in bad shape to try to fool with the
[1:00:00] prophet's message
[1:00:02] me and you both
[1:00:09] we can't correct him but he can correct
[1:00:12] us
[1:00:15] he stands before no one
[1:00:19] we stand before him
[1:00:23] you get it what he says is law
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:32] yeah but that's what i just said come
[1:00:34] and show me
[1:00:36] you say well the prophet was wrong here
[1:00:38] coming let's sit down and talk about it
[1:00:39] well the prophet was wrong about the
[1:00:41] white horse rider
[1:00:42] come and let's sit down and talk about
[1:00:43] it
[1:00:46] because no one could could
[1:00:49] teach that until the seals broke
[1:00:53] amen right and they broke to the prophet
[1:01:02] do you realize church that the prophet
[1:01:05] preached a message one day
[1:01:08] and that we are already judged
[1:01:14] you know me and you is already judged
[1:01:16] because we're judged by what we're doing
[1:01:17] with this message
[1:01:21] yeah but that's just what you think well
[1:01:22] come on
[1:01:24] let's talk about what you think
[1:01:27] i have no fear just tell you that we'll
[1:01:29] stand before our congregation
[1:01:32] and every who comes out to be right let
[1:01:34] them be right and who's wrong let it be
[1:01:36] wrong
[1:01:38] because that's me
[1:01:42] i believe in the five-fold ministry i
[1:01:46] believe a five-fold ministry is for the
[1:01:47] perfecting of the saints
[1:01:49] there's no scripture that said the
[1:01:50] prophet is for the perfecting of the
[1:01:52] saints show it to me
[1:01:54] but the whole bible now before you start
[1:01:55] calculating the whole bible shows you
[1:01:58] that the five-fold ministry and
[1:01:59] everything has got to come underneath
[1:02:01] that prophet
[1:02:03] and what he's teaching
[1:02:08] well he says things i don't understand
[1:02:10] well
[1:02:11] who are you you think you can straighten
[1:02:13] him out
[1:02:16] no but brother dale you're just not
[1:02:19] you're
[1:02:20] you just seem to been you've you've got
[1:02:22] where you're just hateful
[1:02:28] i don't see that i've changed that much
[1:02:30] but if i'm hateful i'm sorry
[1:02:33] well i am 81.
[1:02:38] right i got the proof for it
[1:02:44] not to show that i got a right to be
[1:02:46] arrogant and hateful no
[1:02:51] but do you believe the prophet that away
[1:02:55] can you put everything you've got
[1:02:58] if they come down to you now and start
[1:03:00] questioning you
[1:03:04] because it's coming eventually
[1:03:09] what's going to be your answer
[1:03:12] when they take the message and slap it
[1:03:14] in your face
[1:03:15] just like the statement i made a while
[1:03:17] ago brother branham made the statement
[1:03:18] he said if you find me off one word
[1:03:21] he said then i've got to be off all the
[1:03:23] way
[1:03:24] he said don't believe me
[1:03:30] that what he said well then what are you
[1:03:33] going to do about the white horse rider
[1:03:34] that all those years he talked to
[1:03:36] and what are you going to do with god
[1:03:38] when the prophet said
[1:03:40] and he was teaching in the message
[1:03:41] because in the church age book
[1:03:45] and he said if i've told you the truth
[1:03:47] let god come and vindicate it
[1:03:52] and god come down and vindicate it and
[1:03:54] him preaching that the white horse rider
[1:03:55] was the holy ghost
[1:04:01] come on wake up
[1:04:08] he said if i'm wrong i'm wrong
[1:04:15] yeah see god is just good enough
[1:04:19] to not have somebody to correct nothing
[1:04:20] because he didn't have to have it
[1:04:24] the prophet stood before no one
[1:04:28] but why can't the fifo ministry find
[1:04:30] their place
[1:04:31] of who they're supposed to be and what
[1:04:33] they're supposed to be gathered in
[1:04:35] and say this is it like i told you
[1:04:38] before about it back in the 70s
[1:04:40] they were arguing about the where the
[1:04:42] prophet was out there hunting on certain
[1:04:44] dates and it's that yeah
[1:04:47] but you see the old men of the message
[1:04:49] the one that was
[1:04:50] would come through with the prophet and
[1:04:51] thing a lot of them stood up and said we
[1:04:54] don't care what you bring
[1:04:56] this man brought us to god can you say
[1:05:00] that
[1:05:01] can you say this message brought me to
[1:05:06] god
[1:05:09] you don't have to practice and pour it
[1:05:10] out do you got a sister back there
[1:05:12] never been through organization one day
[1:05:15] she decided to come be one of us
[1:05:17] thank god she didn't have to be trained
[1:05:21] or tutored or
[1:05:23] reprogrammed
[1:05:28] see god's going to lead us he'll take us
[1:05:31] through
[1:05:31] i'm not concerned about that i'm
[1:05:33] concerned about me and you
[1:05:36] getting us ready against that day
[1:05:39] that we can see our part of what we're
[1:05:43] doing
[1:05:46] see no wonder the young kids don't want
[1:05:51] the message
[1:05:53] the mamas and daddies is not living them
[1:05:55] before them
[1:06:02] there's one thing the kids know for
[1:06:04] certain i've taught this 40 to 50 years
[1:06:06] ago
[1:06:06] we've got to take what he's saying it's
[1:06:08] not what you think about it
[1:06:10] it's not what you believe what i believe
[1:06:13] what you believe
[1:06:14] ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:06:17] it's what god said through a prophet
[1:06:22] just like i said that a minute ago now
[1:06:23] come on
[1:06:25] you know the prophet taught what he did
[1:06:27] and about the white horse rider
[1:06:29] what are you going to do when they come
[1:06:30] before you and say well he was wrong
[1:06:32] there
[1:06:34] how are you going to say it what are you
[1:06:36] going to tell them
[1:06:41] i'm going to tell them he wasn't wrong
[1:06:44] you're wrong well you you no no no
[1:06:48] god you see
[1:06:51] he was the prophet he's not god
[1:06:55] no no
[1:06:58] but i will say he was the closest thing
[1:07:00] they are to it in this generation in
[1:07:01] time i had no problem with that
[1:07:03] that don't make nothing no more out of
[1:07:05] him than any other human mortal because
[1:07:06] i believe every born-again believer
[1:07:08] i stand in jeffersonville indiana and
[1:07:10] this man was explaining how that brother
[1:07:12] branham was god
[1:07:13] it was deity i said if you'll i said
[1:07:16] brother
[1:07:16] if you'll tell i said that brother right
[1:07:18] there point it over to a man
[1:07:20] i said he says he's got the new birth
[1:07:25] the man's yeah i said well then if
[1:07:28] you'll say
[1:07:29] that brother branham's got the new birth
[1:07:31] like that man's got the new birth
[1:07:34] then i'll believe in deity because i
[1:07:36] believe every born-again believer is god
[1:07:38] made manifest
[1:07:39] in that human flesh in the new birth
[1:07:42] i believe you have the bear have the new
[1:07:45] birth
[1:07:46] you have the very god of the word
[1:07:49] living within your soul
[1:07:56] of course you know what happened i said
[1:07:59] but if you'll agree
[1:08:00] that that man's got the new birth and
[1:08:02] that makes him deity
[1:08:03] like brother branham's got the new birth
[1:08:05] and that makes him deity
[1:08:06] i'm explaining it to you i said i'll go
[1:08:08] along with you he said
[1:08:10] oh no well i got along with him along my
[1:08:14] way i went
[1:08:16] i began to proceed to move on
[1:08:21] because i was about to the basis
[1:08:23] pentecostal boy
[1:08:25] at work one time told me you know was
[1:08:27] talking about the
[1:08:28] the things of the bible and different
[1:08:30] things like that and i said well
[1:08:32] that's not right and he said well that's
[1:08:35] what i believe
[1:08:38] i said well i'm glad you said it that's
[1:08:41] like
[1:08:41] you know that's what you believe because
[1:08:43] i don't believe it
[1:08:44] you know i believe just what i'm trying
[1:08:48] to get you to see
[1:08:49] because i'm backing it up all the way
[1:08:50] through the bible
[1:08:52] going back even to the old testament to
[1:08:54] read that psalmist
[1:08:55] to where he says he would come
[1:08:58] and descend and receive
[1:09:02] gifts and see that's exactly what he'd
[1:09:06] done
[1:09:06] on the day of pentecost he ascended on
[1:09:08] high and he'd come back
[1:09:10] the next you know a few days there come
[1:09:12] when the upper room experienced the time
[1:09:14] he came back in the baptism of the holy
[1:09:17] ghost
[1:09:19] in those people that made god manifested
[1:09:22] in a human form
[1:09:24] that was meant to be
[1:09:28] what about it like i'm saying about that
[1:09:31] man he said
[1:09:32] i'm not working at pentecost he said i'm
[1:09:34] not working on commanding
[1:09:36] uh the devil
[1:09:40] he said no you're not he's no no
[1:09:43] he said i'm working on commanding god
[1:09:48] i said
[1:09:51] he said yeah i said the bible says
[1:09:53] command you me i said
[1:09:55] it don't say for you to tell him how to
[1:09:57] do it
[1:10:01] it's not you commanding god if you're
[1:10:04] accepting what god has said about it and
[1:10:06] believing it and standing on what god
[1:10:08] has said
[1:10:12] you see why can't we be that way because
[1:10:14] if it is true
[1:10:16] i'm basing in this life few comments on
[1:10:17] this one thing if you believe this end
[1:10:19] time message
[1:10:21] truly believe it then you have to
[1:10:23] believe that there was just one prophet
[1:10:25] to come in the end time
[1:10:26] it was one message there was one being
[1:10:28] and we don't need all of these running
[1:10:30] around the country claiming to be
[1:10:31] another prophet
[1:10:32] you know brother branham
[1:10:36] but we can have the five-fold ministry
[1:10:39] that can walk in the in the shoe heels
[1:10:42] of the man that brought it to us
[1:10:45] and believe what he said
[1:10:48] and he'll answer the questions
[1:10:55] i always wondered during the scriptures
[1:10:56] wanted it said it in revelation you know
[1:10:59] but it said but in the days of the voice
[1:11:00] of the seventh angel when he's
[1:11:02] they'll begin to sound and all that i
[1:11:04] used to wonder about that we had a
[1:11:05] meeting one day on
[1:11:07] on the fifo ministry people talking and
[1:11:10] trying
[1:11:10] and i tried my best to show them a
[1:11:12] little something
[1:11:13] in that and uh the brother later coming
[1:11:16] up the road he said i've never seen you
[1:11:18] so down and out
[1:11:20] i said well what do you mean i said
[1:11:24] i told them brothers the truth and even
[1:11:26] read them thus saith the lord
[1:11:29] from the prophet and they wouldn't
[1:11:31] believe it
[1:11:35] i said i don't understand why they don't
[1:11:38] want to believe it
[1:11:38] but in the day and when it did it hit me
[1:11:41] why does it say that
[1:11:45] the days of the voice of several things
[1:11:47] but
[1:11:48] why does it put a butt in there like
[1:11:50] that
[1:11:52] that's over in chapter 10
[1:11:57] right
[1:12:00] can't you see the end of chapter 3
[1:12:04] that there was a prophet to come
[1:12:08] right chapter 3 to the 3 14
[1:12:12] beginning of the creation of god a
[1:12:14] prophet was to come
[1:12:19] and john is told to bring forth what god
[1:12:22] has given to him
[1:12:23] and he gives each church his place these
[1:12:25] times laying it down
[1:12:27] and then he gets over here and he's
[1:12:28] standing there and he said well
[1:12:30] in other words john was saying i can't
[1:12:33] go any further because
[1:12:38] i don't have anything for it to go to
[1:12:41] and it rung inside of him but in the
[1:12:43] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:12:45] his mind went back to chapter three and
[1:12:47] our stood
[1:12:48] brother branham as the angel of the lady
[1:12:51] of seeing
[1:12:52] not just church itself but to the church
[1:12:55] to the bride
[1:12:56] but in the days of the voice that when
[1:12:59] that man would bring the message to you
[1:13:01] and i we'd receive that message and be
[1:13:03] able to walk therein
[1:13:06] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:13:07] seventh angel
[1:13:13] be church god will do things for us if
[1:13:15] we'll let him
[1:13:19] i have been accused of being everything
[1:13:21] in the book from the know it all to
[1:13:22] everything you know and and it's the
[1:13:26] basis of saying well brother
[1:13:27] dale you're just you're just too smart
[1:13:29] ethnically you're just too
[1:13:31] arrogant you're too hateful one of these
[1:13:34] days you'll wish you'd never said that
[1:13:38] because one day you'll find out
[1:13:42] that what i tried to tell you is right
[1:13:46] then you'll have your problems you'll
[1:13:47] have to answer to god yourself
[1:13:50] but i've tried my best to take this
[1:13:52] message and break it down to the people
[1:13:53] that they could see jesus christ
[1:13:55] living the same in you and me
[1:13:59] and believing in a fivefold ministry
[1:14:03] for the perfecting of the saints to
[1:14:05] bring this message to the congregation
[1:14:08] but you know what the congregation has
[1:14:10] got to be the message
[1:14:14] you got your part
[1:14:17] we just got our part we're just doing
[1:14:19] what we can do to try to help you
[1:14:21] your part is to believe it come on
[1:14:23] musicians
[1:14:25] think on these things gifts and calling
[1:14:30] gifts and calling it comes right down to
[1:14:34] where we're standing
[1:14:39] and the hour that we're here
[1:14:42] and to believe the message
[1:14:46] and say my whole soul is sold out
[1:14:50] we saw old brother duret yesterday down
[1:14:54] at the funeral there
[1:14:56] i said looked at him and i said yep
[1:14:58] anchored my soul in melakafall
[1:15:02] most of you here are old enough to be
[1:15:04] able to been around for
[1:15:05] 30 40 years you know what i'm talking
[1:15:07] about they used to tell him to come on
[1:15:09] up and sing
[1:15:10] he'd always sang the same thing i've
[1:15:13] anchored my soul
[1:15:15] in malachi
[1:15:19] i don't have no other place for to be
[1:15:21] anchored i have no extras in case we
[1:15:24] don't make it
[1:15:26] i don't have a bank account in swiss to
[1:15:28] worry that we can house some money in
[1:15:30] case we need it
[1:15:34] i do believe the prophet's message
[1:15:38] but it's for the bride to receive that
[1:15:40] message
[1:15:43] and by way of the prophets and just
[1:15:46] remember one thing
[1:15:48] the reason i said that while ago do you
[1:15:49] realize what people are doing i want to
[1:15:51] say there's one
[1:15:52] statement somebody made a statement one
[1:15:53] time it might have been brother branham
[1:15:55] but it was not it was a good statement
[1:15:59] he said if you go against a prophet
[1:16:03] you know in some way you're going to
[1:16:06] face every prophet
[1:16:09] the spirit of that prophet is prevalent
[1:16:13] in
[1:16:13] every prophet so you're going to face
[1:16:17] every prophet
[1:16:20] well i don't believe that that brother
[1:16:22] branham taught paul correctly you're
[1:16:24] gonna face paul and brother branham
[1:16:27] the angels there of each one you're
[1:16:30] gonna face every prophet down through
[1:16:32] time
[1:16:34] so it ain't going to be a nice day
[1:16:39] it's our chance now to receive and
[1:16:40] believe it well pretty dale i believe
[1:16:42] the message
[1:16:43] all right i'm not asking you to turn
[1:16:45] cartwheels and and to do this out of
[1:16:47] that i'm asking you one thing
[1:16:50] can you put your whole life on what
[1:16:53] you've heard
[1:16:59] can you lay everything on what you've
[1:17:01] heard
[1:17:05] and lay it there correctly that we're
[1:17:06] not trying to
[1:17:08] build up anything or any man or any
[1:17:10] point we're just trying to tell the
[1:17:11] truth
[1:17:15] believe it let's stand together
