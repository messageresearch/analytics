TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now today I just have a little simple lesson on the blood so I wanted to turn to First Corinthians chapter 11. First Corinthians chapter 11. okay First Corinthians chapter 11. chapter 11. and do we have a verse on that yet versus make sure I'm in the frame here 24. and 25. take it easy we ready now one time I heard an old oak tree say that you don't have a right to open the word to first go to the author yes so let's uh let's go to the author real quick Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for your grace to us today to be able to gather around your word my pray Lord that you'll come down I'm going to say open up your word to us so we can get the benefit of it Lord Jesus granted Lord that you'll be here by the way and all the ones that are traveling this morning to do with the service this morning we pray and ask these things in your name amen so um First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 24 and 25. say yes and when he had given things break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this dude and the limits of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had Subs saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this Duty as often as you drink it and remembrance of me now that's what I want to talk about this morning this cup is the New Testament in my blood a new testament not something that's even greater than what was spoken of in the Old Testament but magnification of all the things that were typed in the Old Testament and you know a lot of times when I when I think about how I look at scripture I like to compare it uh some things about my Approach compare it to maybe what the Catholics believe and how they look at things and kind of make sure that that helps kind of to to to to look at what other people believe I I hope you don't get the wrong impression by that book you know the Catholics look at at the Old Testament and the new test they look at the Old Testament just like the Jews did in Exodus 19 is something to do something some some some laws to to uh that they needed to accomplish to satisfy a requirement from God and then we'll come over to the New Testament and it's another set of laws another set of they look at us something else to do just something else to try to satisfy to try to satiate God's requirement and and it's it's uh if you look at the Old Testament and what it really is what really happened is it is before the foundation of the world God dwelt in that alone Elohim and that Fountain of love with attributes inside of him and those attributes were written in him and his desire was to expose to manifest those attributes and write them write them uh all down through the ages in different ways and different times first he began to manifest those attributes and his son and out of that out of that Fountain of Love Came to logos then out of that logos came in Genesis 1 26 27 and those attributes began to be written down and written and then he he began to write this story of his attributes in the stars and uh the early Believers in Adam and Eve and and then on down to Abel and uh through the linears they they could look before it was even written in the word they could look up into the Stars and see blessing to see God's word began to be written the whole Redemption story and in the Stars we we looked at before of how you could see that that what was within what was inside of God those attributes of a redeemer a savior uh a Healer they began God put those in the Stars so that they could look up and see and then one day he wrote the in the Old Testament he threw Moses he began to write those first five books of the Bible and through job and all the all the Patriarchs now the question is how did the Bible how was the Bible written was it just written by somebody got an idea or something it was written through the lives lived live and lived that's how the Bible is written they lived a life and then that life that was lived was written so that we could read it and understand what was written in Christ what was written in God before the foundation of the world now so there's there's the Old Testament that God before the foundation the world wanted to write write down what was in him and in the Old Testament scripture we began to see that great plan of God which was not just to manifest himself in his son but to manifest himself in the flesh of his people and all down through the Old Testament that was the story was told until we get to the New Testament and this in the New Testament the story is is magnified because now God can come and put that life that was that was written before the foundation of the world he can put that same life in us and that's the New Testament now if uh what a testament is is it it's a covenant it's the evidence of an event it's the evidence if I want to see uh like if if I had a relative that was that died and they left me a lot of things I I want to see you know you go before the lawyer or whatever the court and they'd say well uh this person left you a fortune a million dollars or whatever it might be and and there might be some people that would maybe argue about that say well I don't believe that you got that you'd say well give me the evidence I want to see the evidence of what was written of what I have and it so I want to impress upon you if you have the opportunity now to take this what this uh the evidence of what you have of what you own it's we should all desire in our in our heart and our lives to seek out what's to review what's what God has has what was written in God before the financial world that we now can possess right and uh you know brother Dale last night in the Bible study was talking about at the uh the Jubilee year and the um uh the 49s and the 50 and you know when they came to that 50th year they got everything that they all need the whole position went back to them they were able to take everything if you go to the Bible and say well is I'm not sure this is I feel like this is sometimes what we do is we'll go read scriptures about healing and say I can see it in the scripture but I'm not 100 sure that it's for me I believe it is for brother Joe I believe it's for uh sister Becca but when you can see in the scripture that it is for you and make it personal that that attribute in God is written here and now I can I I can take possession of that because it's written in this word and it's mine amen no amen and uh you know another reason that I believe we should we should I I I'm a big believer in personal study of God's word is it don't just take um there was a little kitty show that when I was in school called Reading Rainbow and the guy that did that he would say Don't just take my word for it and I I don't want you just take my own word for it when I tell you what's in God's word go back and search it out and prove it and Paul even told us in Galatians 1 8 he said though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed so how do you know if I am preaching to you what's written in the Bible unless you go search it out for yourself and prove that it's really written the way that I'm presenting it and I it doesn't bother me at all if you come in and challenge me and ask me questions is this really show me the quote show me the scripture because uh our our souls are in the balance our our lives are in the balance and we should all be uh be diligent to to a desire to seek out what's written in the coming in the will for us and uh you know the a testament is an Evidence and I I was looking at how job's in job's life how he said her Adventure any of my family has done anything wrong that I will offer a sacrifice and the in the Old Testament their evidence was that blood sprinkled over the limb of the door or when they put their hand on that offering and cut the throat of that animal and that blood just spattered all over them and they were just covered in that blood you know they go before the priest and put their hand over it and there was blood everywhere and they could look at that and say I have done I have met every requirement I have done exactly what God asked now you say God gave us an unconditional Covenant that we don't have to do anything but Abel did still have to go and offer the sacrifice we used to in this day you still have to believe you have to believe you don't have to you don't have to offer Novena you don't have to pay the priest a bunch of money you don't have to do anything of yourself you don't have to go work at the soup kitchen but you have to believe God's word and you have to stand upon his God on his word and that's what job did he he brought his sacrifice and he said now I have done everything that God requires and and then maybe a week later uh maybe they did something else maybe my children did something else and he would go and offer another sacrifice per Adventure they have they have done something wrong and he knew that that blood covered over all the sins now that's a question uh maybe uh maybe in some of our Arts is does the blood take care of all of our sins all of our all of our troubles all of our uh I mean you know we have troubles in this life and everything but the the blood of Jesus Christ is powerful There Is Power in the Blood and I I wonder sometimes maybe if we just really realize how much power to wash away all of our sins to change our lives to give us heat how what what is all what is in the blood what is in the blood is that new testament Covenant the life that was in the blood in the Old Testament it was just the chemistry they had that blood splattered upon them and that life that was in the blood can never come back upon the believer but now in the New Testament the life that was in Christ can come back into believer and make them a new creature in Christ Jesus now you can't have you can't in the Old Testament you know there had to be a substitute there had to be something to substitute and that's because God is a just God he won't just throw out what you have done and you know that would uh nice example I I used before if you came before the judge and and a long list of things that you have done wrong or just sin or even if you've never done anything wrong the fact that you had been born wrong in the first place born and shaped and born and said shape to an equal to spouse from your mother wounds thinking lies you come into the world like that and just that one block on the record is enough to separate me from God so if you come before God and he just puts that in the Trashy then somebody could go to the trash Heap and get that out of the Trashy and pull it up but the blood of God is powerful enough to block that completely out so you can't go to the trash Heap and pull it up now when we say uh you know I I think maybe when you picture in your mind that God puts your sins in the sea of his forgetfulness that we think it's somewhere maybe we think somewhere that you can go and pull it out again now that's what is the Sea of God forgiveness and you know brother Brown told us exactly what the Sea of God that quote uh just bear with me for a second yes um now made a comment that if something's in that please and and say something that that is on them now if they bring it up and like talk you know or whatever I I haven't read but I'm I'm sure it's not sure so um I I can't speak on that right now but that's good now sure because because what God has done he blocks out your sins by putting your sin in that sea of forgiveness and what happens when it's in the sea of forgive us now here's a here's a quote I want to read Investments 1963 0803b notice when this your sins are confessed and your sins are dropped into the bleeps of the blood of the Son of God it remains sins so much that it's it's put in the sea of God's forgiveness and can never even be remembered in his cycle then what that does that make a man a Son of God never then then what that does that make a man a son of God never remembers you to be a sinner you are a son you are a daughter there's no more remembrance of sin it all God puts it in the sea of forgetfulness the bleach so what's to see a forgiveness the sea of forgetfulness is Christ's blood that will shed for you and therefore then you and God are Father and Son by Jesus Christ's Grace not by anything you've done but by his grace you are Sons and Daughters of God you're going to take care of his blessings and of his power and of his life the bleeds of God's blood when you put that dark stain of your sin and that Bleach then that bleed your bleeds will you know take a just tear apart on a molecular level all of the things until you can't find it anymore and brother Brandon talked about how when people would come before him that God would not show him things that they that were under the blood that they have confessed and asked forgiveness for because God it was in God's sea of forgetfulness the blood that was in there it was it was gone it was annihilated and think about how how glorious that is just uh all of the all of the problems all of the uh things that we've done in life and just aside from that just being born wrong which is the the biggest Mark that we all had in our life and so the blood of Jesus Christ annihilates uh annihilates sin and that that uh that's what brings you to Perfection to a perfect place in your soul because it destroys Sin from your soul your soul when you receive the new birth there's no more unbelief in your soul because you're at that place where God gives you your faith his faith and it becomes a possession of that bottom of the Statue of a perfect man that God's faith comes in you and now you can believe and you're that that Mark that was against you that began in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve took something else aside from the revealed word of God and added added a little bit to it or took it took some out then that Mark is annihilated because you become a perfect a perfect creation of Christ Jesus and for him will I accept in 1952 he when you confess a sin he puts it in the sea of forgetfulness to remember it against you no more it's just did you know what this bleach is that you use for your washing Clorox whatever What It Is Well you take just one drop of ink and drop it into that tub of blood what would happen to that drop of ink you couldn't find it could you it would just it would just be bleach is that right well that's the way Sim does when he hits the blood of Jesus Christ it's just no more he don't know what happens to it it's you couldn't get it out of there if you had to anymore she's just done that's right color there's color or black ink but it ain't black no more see it's gone the black has become White and the black is going somewhere and you don't know where it's went is that is is that right that's the way sin is and Micah that that the scripture where the seed of forgetfulness is it doesn't say in the Bible see the Forgiveness but in Micah chapter 7 verse 19 he says he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and now we'll cast all their sins into the depths of the sea now so we're talking about the blood in the New Testament in his blood in the New Testament you know brother Dale always preaches or teaches on where did the New Testament begin now if you read through the through the scriptures you come to a division of scriptures a division of uh you know if somebody said turn to the New Testament of course you're going to turn to Matthew because that is a division of scriptures where the body of text begins at Matthew but the New Testament in it is in his blood it is the life in his blood and that's why the New Testament didn't begin until the day of Pentecost when they had a life that was in him the the attributes that were in him before the foundation of the world began to be written in men and they became written Epistles known and read of all men because those attributes began to be written in people and uh so I think about the scene of the crucifixion and I it came to mind that that song that the old slaves used to sing Were You There When They Crucified My Lord and I wonder if they even knew what they were really seeing and you know what brand of pretty so many sermons about being identified in Christ and how we were in him when he died on the cross and that's a very touchy thing to preach on because many many preached that you were there like the Mormons believed that you were actually physically there like watching the scene and back there you were observing the scene but what was there what was predestinated before the foundation of the world was God's attribute got the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh so that the word could be made flesh in Us in the beginning was the word and that word is what is predestinated God never said I'm gonna I'm Gonna Save uh Joe and not sister because just as just an example just throwing eggs out but he said I am going to predestinate myself my word and if you in this day if you believe me if you uh one day when you accept it when you're filled with the Holy Ghost that word that was there before the foundation of the world comes alive and you and that is what the New Testament is what was written before the foundation of the world living In the Flesh of the Believers today okay and uh God's only provided a place of worship in 1965 uh brother Brown said Moses was in him Joshua was in him and if you are in him you was in him before the foundation of the world the family of God you suffered with him you died with him you went to the cross with him you raised with him and now you're still with him sitting in Heavenly places reflecting the message of the age to the world the light of the world how could you be in him because the life that was in him is now in you and that life never had a beginning and will never had it had an ending in my life by itself without the new birth would have an ending but because his life has come and lived in me it is alive in me now I am part of a a God's Eternal plan part of his eternal life that Eternal Word that was written before the foundation of the world and what was written in now can be made manifest and be written in me yeah and uh so what does the New Testament do the New Testament is all about God being made manifest in flesh and uh that's why this communion scripture is so important all down through scripture that's why Phineas uh was so upset when that doctrine of Balaam came into the camp and the people that should have been that were professing that they were real true believers they said we believe the message of the hour and then they went in the tent and took that false Doctrine took grabbed a hold of that false Doctrine and got away from the real too True Word of God just like they did in the Garden of Eden and Phineas rose up and said I can't stand it they're they're they're saying now take that over to the day they're saying that they're Christians they're saying that they believe the message of the hour but they're denying the power of God they're denying what Paul preached they're denying what by the real priest yeah that's why that's what uh the That's What's So Scary About the community scriptures because if you say that the word those attributes that were in God before the foundation of the world if you late in the confession that that life is living in you and you make that confession before your church and then you go and take communion then you're a drinking damnation to yourself uh you're drinking yourself your body into sickness and things because you're not Discerning the body of God that you're not Discerning the New Testament that God has made manifest that that whole point of the New Testament is for God to be made manifest in his people so we look at at what Jesus did with the blood and and I wonder how often we wonder are all of these promises for me I was going to segue right into healing a little bit because I I was thinking the thought when you look at Salvation does God make a difference did God in the Old Testament when when someone came for salvation did he make the difference between a sick Gentile and a sick Jew is there a difference is that is that what your salvation is based upon by your flesh by your your uh by how good you are or by your your natural language stand up that's why I believe that even Cain himself if he would have accepted the blood sacrifice that the blood and the looking down through time two thousand years that the blood sacrifice is more than able to cleanse even canes even that sins who came and I have a quote from brother Brandon where he said that and uh so I'm about to run out of time talk fast so the question ask for continuation the question is what is the difference to God between a sick Gentile and a sick Jew what is the difference between someone that maybe came from just a horrible image where your mother and your father were out in sin uh just doing things uh and you know all down through the pro the Old Testament you had prostitutes uh David came from uh the lineage of prostitute and uh so I I don't believe that God if if and even in the New Testament when the uh uh uh um drawing a blank where she was from but Jesus called her a dog and because she was a gentile and uh but if if someone is sick or needy spiritually comes to God then God the blood of Jesus Christ is more than able to atone for any problems anything in their life and and God hiding himself in Simplicity in 1963 brother Randall said God is able of these stones said John to rise children to Abraham don't think you're God's children because you're born a Jew and don't think you can't be God's child because you're born a certain way or don't have a certain lineage to be proud of and don't have this and that because the blood of Jesus Christ can can uh it can fix all of that and uh marriage and divorce 1965 you can take the ordinance onerous woman in the town the worst man if they had a baby it would have to come from the Lord because God has lost it together and these laws like the sun to raise you put a cockle bird in a good field will grow and it has to grow because it's God's law what seed is planted it must grow and nothing can grow life but God because it operates under his laws therefore when the evil seed was planned in the womb of Eve it had to bring forth because it's God's law of production and it could do nothing else but bring it and it had to come from God that's the reason that people say little babies sometimes that's not born with Christian parents are lost isn't that terrible Jesus Christ blood a tones for the child I don't care how much it was born and how evil it was born he is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world the little child cannot repent because it has nothing to repent for and that was the sin of the world which was taken away by the blood of Christ babies go to him now if God can do that for a little baby what about when it grows up and wants to turn his life over to God it don't matter where it came from and I think that's I'm gonna stop right there but I think that's just the most beautiful thing about God's the power of God's blood it's more powerful than maybe we think sometimes
