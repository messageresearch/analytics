brother Anderson died he goes to California for work he's I don't stay that alone I can see why we don't want to stay there too long is it the earth start shaking but today we're just going to read a couple of script one scripture one quote and then we'll get into our into our trip and tell you some things that that have they have come from it so let's just bow our heads and pray before we get started we know there's a lot of people out a lot of people traveling like said brother Joe and all some of them are going on vacation this week so we just want to pray for traveling mercies your heavenly father would pray Lord today that you would take care of us here Lord at this time we set aside Lord to talk about you Lord and the things that that you're doing Lord around the world we know

give the missionaries on the foreign fields Lord that you'll give them fruit for their labor we ask these things in Jesus name Amen I was looking in the through the Bible looking for a scripture to to read before we get started so I think this one is pretty when we decided to go back to the Philippines you know we'd been three years ago and we had preached at many places and we were there for three weeks and we got to go to more places that we did this time but there was an urgency I thought even from talking with the brother Vernon brother Burrell brother Danny brother Nestor that there was a I need to go and try to strengthen the Brethren you know talk about the position give him give him some not just as they said that wasn't that wasn't Bernal ice cream so you know we vanilla is good but the pinellas plane so we wanted to kind of give them a little uh a little something else to chew on but here let's read the scripture for this cause this is paul from the colossians for this cause actually is talking to timothy for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will and all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks into the father which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in life you may be seated in Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word I'll read you one quote I like this quote from Satan's Eden brother branham's talking he says the things the thing of it is is today we don't try to establish the Word of God in the people heart that was 1965 let's just read this today we don't try to establish the Word of God in the people's heart we are trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart we are commanded to establish the Word of God Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of men that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of man but I came to you in power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost that your faith might rest in God there you are man mustn't establish yourself we find it amongst let God do something for a person and send them out you'll find every man trying to impersonate it see they're trying to with themselves every man I did this me I mind my denomination me this alright establishing themselves what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of God establish the Word of God this was what I like here establish the Word of God take out the unbelief and establish the kingdom of God in a man's heart and the kingdom of God cannot be established in a man's heart less God made that man thus all right so we we wanted to that's what we wanted to do in the Philippines it's not that they don't know the word but it's like I told them that I was sorry that all the false doctrines they you they usually have on those in the Philippines come from America and they agreed oh yeah it comes from here this is where it comes from it comes straight from here because we've got all the knowledge and we've got all the books and we've got all the tapes brother Bob thank you god bless your heart that's good job Bob never hands them to me like that that's my little brother I like that shirt I'm gonna get me a shirt like yeah like a shirt that's good color thanks for displaying it for everybody to see but you know you you do you see people you go to your these different places and first thing you hear is the doctrine we're battling we're battling we're battling I mean you know it was two souls seven Thunder it's over there two Lords and the one I told you the other day about 14 seals they there's a group that reads in reading there in Revelations five that there are seven seals on the outside of the book seven seals on the inside well that's not even the way it reads so their interpretation of the Bible was wrong it reads there was written in and on the backside sealed with seven seals so there's only seven seals you know so in one of the in one of the classes I guess you might say and plowin is where that doctrine is the most prevalent I took him did my little seal illustration you know but I told him I said look there's only really one seal and they were really they'd really never seen it that way we're a grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption so there's really only one seal and once that seal is open it's you Christ in you the hope of glory all right so it's just really one seal it's not it's not 14 but they're 14 - see there's always an angle to a false doctrine number one a false doctrine establishes the person that brings the doctrine not Christ it always established and exalts that person or you got to come to that group to get the other seven seals we know brother Brown preached seven seals well we got a seventh seal book you know the seal book the book book but they've got the other seven I said they do whoever these people are they're preaching it they have the other seven and you got to go to them to get that seven so one thing's for sure if you start excluding and doing the I me me you've got to come to me to hear this you know one thing's for sure that it's not God if you have to go to that specific place and listen to that specific doctrine then we know what that is that's going toward a cult so so we don't we tried to we tried to while we were over there I you know I knew about the seven thunders I mean the yeah the the 14th seal but I had never met up with it until brother royal explained it to me and then we just kind of covered it one day and one of the ministers meeting so but let's get started so the island of Manila I think I didn't go over this a few years ago but it's kind of strange that the country of the Philippines is so spread out there's seven thousand islands in the Philippines seven thousand islands three thousand one hundred of them are inhabited so you got from right here all the way down almost here to I can't remember where that's at but anyway right here all this is the Philippines and you really can't see it because there's little island stuck all over the place these are your major big ones but 3,000 of those islands are inhabited so if you get anywhere you got to go buy a boat or by airplane cuz you can't drive a car you might get a car I think you can down to right here but you can't go to this island or this on to this island that one or that one or that one or that one unless you fly or take a boat and this is an island we were on and I'll tell you about just a minute you want to leave just leave out right there but in Metro Manila Metro Manila is like metro Atlanta you got it lanta and then you got metro metro atlanta metro manila has twelve point eight million people in it and i met every one of them in a car on the road there listen there transit system is good and their bus system is good it's worse than when you were over there cuz it was worse than when I was over there they take and their lanes are four lanes on one side and four lanes on the other then they got a pillar in the middle and they got cars above you but they take those four lanes and they make five lanes out of it so it's five lanes of traffic all the time from brother of Vernon's Church which is in go back to the other in in Metro Manila which is just right this little spot right here it's where the four major message churches are brother Royals brother brother where else a little further out brother burden brother Danny and brother Nestor they're not but about 15 miles apart it takes you an hour and a half to get to each one of them brother John knows he's been there he's smiling sister Alicia they know man it's just pitiful but you know you think well there's there's like on our Martis system in Atlanta our Marta system in Atlanta them trains running these like like five people on the whole train not there they got a rapid transit and all you see is you see somebody's got a and he's up against the window and you see his face and 500 other people say this thing is just packed full of people and same way with the buses and then here you are in a car and then they have little motorcycles well John I told them if in America if they would get on scuzz what you do is you're sitting here parked like this or ya bout renting about two miles an hour and all of a sudden there comes a string of five motorcycles and they come down through here they turn in front of you they go down a lane of cars they go up we've I said in America if somebody was to drive by that the next guy would see it he'd purposely opened his door what and he said yes ma'am I tell you American drivers we'd win if we couldn't make it too much over there yeah somebody would open my door cause it's just like little bees you're sitting there parked and crammed in and here they come they come weaving in and out and it's just that's just the way it is you know you and the smog is so bad I'm wondering why in the world but you know what that's where God put them that's where God put them because there's 12 million people just in that little dot there's 12 point eight million people I mean there's a lot of people have scattered out on these islands and once you get up here we were up in here this is where Mount Pinatubo is right about here we were up in here the second the second day and the time before we were over here in this part this is where Donnellan is where we established or paid for a church to be rebuilt over here and several years ago and then we really just stayed right in here this time and actually I could say we want up here then we come back but those churches with three to four hundred people in each church three or four hundred people in each church they only live 15 miles apart but it takes them I wouldn't have to get there so you know we're happy because save you all are about 15 miles maybe right takes you about what 15 minutes to get there now you'd go to another church it was close closer to commerce if you were there you just it blows your mind you know but but with all those there's believers on pretty much every island the say this part of the island down here roll it grant screen down to here let me see this Mindanao is probably the worst area to be in because this was a Muslim controlled area for a long time and now the Christians have started moving in so there was a lot of there was a lot of guerrilla warfare and guerrilla fighting but but now hey they got a president now shoot first ask questions later he put a bounty on drug dealers I don't know if you all know that or not he put a bounty on drug dealers and they have killed drug dealers by the hundreds and all you do is you just bring them in and prove that you killed them and then you get like thousand dollars or welcome pesos but yeah I guarantee you one thing's what they said they said you won't see a man out on the street dealing drugs no more if he's doing drugs he's found him a secret place but you know what it was so rapid till he had to do something so that's what he did and some love him some hate him kind of the way our places are there some love them some hate him so who cares but we were up there in Manila pretty much most of the time that we're gonna be in here later on but let's go to the first slide and also I tell you I didn't did I know I did that's going to bring you some money they have their real big Spanish influence and they go by the peso so their pesos are fifty to fifty two to one so every 50 pesos is one American dollar and I'll tell you something kids if you go to Manila to get a job which that's where most of the jobs that's why everybody's crammed in there when you go to Manila to apply for a job just at a what they have is they have a McDonald's on about every three corners and then they have a place called jolly beach you get that done but John knows all this he's been there we converse while y'all are all asleep he was the only one away so me and him as mr. Alicia would talk and but there's a guy that said well if McDonald's is gonna open I'll never throw three corners I'm gonna start a restaurant not as that's called jolly bees and it's basically a mirror image of McDonald anyway so we were there this was the last time I don't know if I told you but I'll tell you again for dead we walked into a Jollibee and there was like 30 people probably 18 19 years old sitting around with real nice clothes on and had a manila folder in their hand like this and then one or two would go in and come out one or two go in and come out and I asked myself what are they doing they said well they're applying for a job at this fast food restaurant they must prove they have a two-year college degree before they're even interviewed two year college degree before Jollibee our mcdonald's will even interview these people for a job and they make about maybe five US dollars a day about 20 about 250 pesos a day I think their average salary is like 1,500 to 1,600 pesos a week for a five-day week so that's that's not much but just they gotta have a two years college degree a two years degree prove they've been to college for two years just to get a job at a fast-food restaurant that's how competitive their job market is all right so and then you know they're working for less than $1 an hour about a dollar an hour sometimes so that's that's just thank God we live in a man we live in America and man we might have the worst we might have the worst this guy the other but I think I'll take here cuz they had no place like home somebody ought to write a song about that there is no place like oh but you know what is nothing to them this their home too so you respect that but yeah they're there economy's doing better but once you get outside of Manila it's not like you know we get outside of Atlanta and we still do okay we're all right and and such you know if you think about it think about even an average you take an average salary here of $600 a week you know on a medium scale that's thirty five thousand pesos a week they never seen thirty five thousand pesos in a month much less a week so you know they they live together and live you know brother brother Vernon's kids three of them got together and instead of driving an hour and a half to work which is only eight miles they all rent an apartment right where they work so you've got these big high-rise apartment places right there and I think brother John and sister Alicia I'm telling you that place that the the courtyard that you eat it's nice but what they do is they come in and see we're 12 hours different so their call centers because some of the brothers and sisters work at the call center their call center works at night because it's daylight over here because it today right now it's ten minutes till 3:00 Monday morning over there so they run their call centers at night over there because that midnight there is 12 o'clock in the day over here well that's when you get your calls you don't want a call center to call you at midnight maybe once but what they do is is they have this building and then they have people that work in the morning but then all them people leave well when they leave they turn the parking lot into just a it looks like a festival tents and fire and fryers and mango sheiks who anyway let's get back to the subject anyway so this place unit so they make this for the people that work at night and they come in and what they do is at about five o'clock in the morning they have to pack all that up and move it somewhere else so the people can park there so these are not restaurants that can stay there they're restaurants they have to be mobile so they have their grills and all their stuff but it's a really it's a nice place to eat didn't brother John good place to eat and you work not for you far from there didn't you you were right there to build it they showed me the building before you yeah brother John can look down and see see that so it was a good place - a good place to eat so anyway so let's get started we took our flight you can go ahead and pull the first person picture up if you want to so when I get to brother Danny stole my flight was good everything was fine I got my luggage that time hey man didn't get it coming back but this was waiting on me brother Danny del mundo he I stayed at his house for a couple of nights but we get in Friday night late and his youngest daughter which I'll show you in a minute her name's face you everybody remembers brother Danny a little short real dark dark brother that's them over there you can see him in the top so they welcomed me with this platter and they told brother Danny called me the other day and he said we haven't erased that yet so we want you to come back so I think that's really neat everybody's history Isabella she's kind of crafty in that way so but we went to brother Danny's we're off Friday night Saturday was kind of a man I had to get my I had to get my 12 to 12 figured out well John how long did it take you to do that a week it took me about three days cuz see when you arrived there I left Thursday morning when I got there Friday it was Friday night so you go past the date line the national date line is here in the Philippines is right here so they're at a different day than you are you know going around the world so flying there you gain but coming back you lose and I'll tell you about that later but when you do though when you land though at 10:45 at night your body thinks it's 10:45 in the morning back where it was 20 hours ago so you're standing there at midnight wide awake because you're your body says it's 12 o'clock the afternoon so Saturday I kind of slept a little bit during the day while they did all their work so I kind of get acclimated to the it took me about three days - that ain't really jet lag that's just totally something different than jet lag I've had jet lag but that a jet lag that's like your body's going you need to be asleep and then you're awake so but twelve hours difference it's what it that's what it does to you so let's go now to Sunday this is brother Danny's church he lives underneath land obviously land is at a premium with twelve point eight million people wanting to live in the same one mile area you know art one on one mile 20 or 30 mile area well you see a lot of things stacked up when brother Dale was there I think the church ended right here somewhere close to that well they've extended and make the pulpit and they've got a balcony so let's go the next and that's looking from the back to of the front like I said brother Danny lives underneath underneath the house then they have I have an outside courtyard down here so go the next slide all right this is when we first got started the first thing I asked them I don't know some of you may have seen this online but the first thing I asked him I said look you see all their songs are in English they sing no song in Tagalog or any other language all they're all of them come up just like this and they know when to clap huh oh the like they know when to clap I said y'all know when to clap and cry and everything else I said but then when I come out to preach you gotta have an interpreter how I'm really I was I was intrigued because look they would sing they knew when to clap they knew when to stop they knew when the crack goes it was a sad part of the song you know they knew when to worship but when you get a prayer to preach they go so that was one of my that was one of my questions that I asked him said why in the world can y'all sing in English and I have to somebody has because now brother Danny interpreted this night but all the other nights that don't because he hasn't a bit of an older group so the older group understands - golem and a little bit of English the younger group like brother royal has and brother Vernon's really younger and more educated they all are educated in English in the Philippines but they still have hold on to that and I think the guy look really if Christine was here its a mix between Spanish English Portuguese you just mix all that together and because I can I can kind of understand what they're saying knowing just a little bit of Spanish but they've had a real they had a real good Spanish influence actually it was they were Spanish colonies back when they got established and then you know we come over there in the 40s liberated them and stayed there two of two big base of Air Force bases on the island and we just you know flooded the island in the forties actually I talked to a man there's a beekeeper friend of mine that he flew over there during the Korean War I don't know the Vietnam War we stayed over there in the Philippines because that was really close to Vietnam he said they were actually telling that they would be signs that said Americans go home we've had enough of you so but now they everything is okay so I didn't feel I felt just as home there as I do here so next slide all right that's when we're getting ready to just keep going that's brother Danny that's beside [Music] that's the people [Music] they put air conditioners in see the air conditioners in the top they helped maybe five degrees okay maybe ten but that's about it but that's that was Sunday he did not have an anniversary meeting he had a Thanksgiving meeting and there was you know that was people here and people down in the courtyard sign they're still good brother Danny trying to figure out [Music] [Music] [Music] okay just keep going onto that web there brother Danny we had a good time there [Music] [Applause] [Music] just going through that safer time I was trying to get the point even being over there you know you you got different levels and you got a you got a really preach to the whole group of people [Music] but you really need to be letting the Lord to do what you do because you don't want to hurt people but you want to make sure that they get everything hang on go back to go back to brother Joe Joe I'm gonna show this is this is daddy's friend and these were all little bitty babies when they were over there before this ability o Joe and his wife he drove down around everywhere he went while he was over there so he he decided to be my driver he'd come pick me up at the airport and he drove me around so and I think his his roof was leaking so bad that then I think brother Dale do you paid to put a roof on his house didn't you yeah so he's still there after about 14 years they're still there so that's the EM they said to tell you all hello brother Joe Joe is actually brother and sister Isabella's brother and they live right there at the church so all right keep going this is sister faith this is this is sister Isabella's youngest kid she is like she's crazy see what I mean it gets worse that's what that's her telling y'all hello oh they were I guess they were showing from here to over here the airplane flight took me to Seattle from Seattle we went around this way to say and I'm telling you if you ever want to fly to South Korea I had a problem I thought maybe when I flew in South Korea it was going to be like they were gonna have to get the goats and the cows off the runway it's the most beautiful airport I've ever seen in my life way prettier than they got gardens and trees growing in there really really nice people but Korean air is a different situation anyway Korean air is Korean hot air because from South Korea then we stayed for a state for an hour there last time I flew into Japan and flew but we flew in himself I flew in here to save a little money but you fly in here another five hours to get to the Philippines there was zero zero air conditioning on that plane I sweat in places I didn't know I had places when I got finished I thought I was in a sauna sure enough I was bathed I was like sister Frieda oh I you know they tell you to take that little pamphlet out and read it you know in case there's an accident all these things you need to do and where the exits are I know what it's for now five hours I did this and the guy sitting beside me was American and he was helping every once in a while you know he but it was it was not good so you know how everybody writes reviews I used to never do that I did Korean air got a review but anyway it wasn't working but so what we done was is we took there's some of the slide there's some of the pictures hang on just leave it right there there's some of the pictures that didn't take because on well they took but they're sideways so brother Anderson couldn't fix them and I don't know why they turned out that way but after I we finished at brother Danny's we left brother Danny's Sunday night and went to brother Royals on Sunday evening he has a little know about this size it's got a bathroom and a place to sleep in his chair and and a table and a couch for people come in like me in different ministers to stay in so we stayed there Monday night Tuesday morning we got up at 4 o'clock in the morning now we couldn't get to we couldn't get to we had paid for a church to be built where Mount Pinatubo is used to be I mean this thing was a huge mountain and it's like half of it gone so it's just a flat plane they obviously everybody got moved away from it and they're called the Aeta at Indians tribe and it's the original there little old bitty the guy I met he was about this tall about 70 years old real deep set eyes and he he looked like a color uh negro he looked just like black kinky black hair but he was a he's the original Filipino tribe actually the ethnic tribe when Americans went over there in the 40s Japan was already there obviously you know they'd already conquered the island and the Americans come in a certain way but they met this tribe and that tribe taught the American soldiers how to survive in the in the jungles of the Philippines so they really helped him out because they do they're hunters they fit their fishermen they survive off of pretty much nothing but we went up we left at four o'clock in the morning and I say that laughing we left at four o'clock in the morning Kota brother Royal said it's four hour drive we got to be there about nine o'clock in the morning because you'll be speaking right around nine o'clock okay so we take off I mean we four hours we go up there like I told you we actually went past mountain to Penta too but we couldn't get there because the water was too high and they had not finished the church yet so we couldn't travel up there you had to travel in one of those jeep haulers that hauled troops you know I'm talking about where the troops sit on each side they climb up in the back there the this high off the ground that's the only way you can get there and we couldn't do that so anyway we went close to it and actually some of them from that church came down to the service but brother Anderson we didn't get any pictures of that none of those they were all sideways but this is us coming down to a place called Subic base yeah this is it right here sorry yeah we did all right let's see this is this is the active tribe brother where L brought two carload three car loads of people this is some of his people here this brother here the one taking the pictures but all these other you see there there these are all the tribal people some of them travelled several hours to get there but the funny part of it is we get there at 9:05 and brother Royals like we got to get out of the vehicle because you know they've been there started it at about 8:30 of they're gonna be waiting and yada yada yadi we get there at 9:05 and there's no one there so the little guy the little preacher guy walks up he comes out of a house he says all we're trying to collect the people and they're coming that well anyway at 11:15 we got started I said so this island is just like Jamaica if you say six o'clock that is just a suggestion don't try that here we start at 10:00 that's what I told him I said now brother Dale don't make suggestions about time via Church I said when he says ten o'clock we gonna be there at ten o'clock or before no we got 11:15 we got started I looked over brother well I said we could have slept two more hours it's all brother don't worry about anyway so we had a good time with the tribal people there was a lot of people that did were not exposed to the message they were doing this outreach to expose the people to the message so I just did a real simple water baptism and a little bit of the Trinitarian doctrine and stuff just to you know get them kind of established and and we'll hear some more from that because there are several people but Subic Bay is where we come back to in Subic Bay is one of the bays that the Americans came in and built a big all this behind here is a big Air Force Base it's run by the Philippines now but it's all it's all Americans we built the base there and there was a ship yard and there was all kind of stuff it's really nice but it's called Subic they and that's some of the brothers now these people got up the same time we did these were sisters and brothers from his church that went with us that four hours up in four hours back they brought all the equipment they sang they have a mobile unit like brother dick has that just with the two speakers and and and they just set it up and then they had that meeting so eventually that was about 250 people showed up for the for the meeting there with the the ethic tribe so that was Monday and then this was coming back Monday that's Monday evening we didn't get back home to probably 10 or 11 o'clock Monday night from that for our trip back because once we got coming back we hit the traffic so we were 5 miles an hour 5 miles an hour you know so but that's just the way you deal with it lets you sleep for a little while so now if you want to go to the go to the plowin map and I'll show you this is this place is to me it's a special place if they'll pull up that just I'll keep talking you pull it up but I'm going to show her where we went to because brother well and I left Tuesday morning early you can only get there two ways and that's by boat or by plane and this is the island here there's there's 1500 islands in Palawan alright so we flew from Manila to here puerto princesa is almost in them in the middle of it and that is a tourist town called pretty princess port the Princesa so that's where we flew from there to here on Tuesday morning and then Tuesday afternoon is when we start our service now this down here is not very inhabited really mountainous this way it's 30-something miles long I mean wide 350 something miles to this one to this one and then those are included there - there was one brother came from this is the island of Corona if you've seen pictures of this place it is beautiful but coron island is off of Palawan but as part of the plowin province so they came in the people come from here the one I ministered the last time I was there see we left and come down into about right here and we spoke in a couple of churches and then we went up here and spoke in a church so we were there for three days but we did three services well I only hit three places but we had that one mystery Expo in puerto princesa right in the restaurant right on top of the hill and there was 60 people there and out of that 60 people that were denominational people they were not message believer 60 preachers some of them are women and we'll tell you a little story about that too but some of were women and - I think two of the three women quit preaching and converted to the message but out of that 60 people there were 20 I heard 26 I heard 29 I don't buddy somewhere in the 20s yeah that's a phenomenal number you number one you can't get 60 denominational people together in America anyway you sure can't get 60 message preachers together anyway but they got there was 60 denominational preachers three years ago when we were over there came to this mystery Expo heard the Word of God heard about a prophet that's what I did the five comings of Elijah with them and talking about the the reason that the five comings had to be because of Elijah dealt with a good woman and a bad woman every Elijah that came on earth dealt with a good woman and a bad woman all right first one second one third one fourth one and even the fifth when you deal with a bride and then you deal with the other part you know so out of that twenty it's either 26 to 29 pastor's converted to the message so out of 60 that's almost half and being almost half that's pretty good that's really good actually you just can't I tell you what happened you know people get a zeal brother as a brother from Ohio he went to Manila ten years ago and he goes back to Ohio and he's going to do this mystery Expo so he rents this big old building and he's got this you know he sense that I think he sends out like 200 Flyers to the denominational churches and wherever in part of Ohio he's in and he rents this banquet building and he's gonna feed everybody and blah blah blah one person showed up one that's how America is that place 60 people showed up on this island on this island 60 people denominational not even message believers they were denominational people showed up to go to this mystery active only way out of that twenty-something churches came out of that we'll see that's when brother Burrell called me back said hey I think we you know we've got 20-something churches and we're trying to get them establishing and thus and so and so I told him I said well that was my whole point of going back I knew I didn't have three weeks like I did last time I only had a couple of weeks on you I needed to spend some time in Manila but I wanted to spend three days here well the only way I could spend three days here and have any impact on those preachers pastors and preachers was to bring them all into one location so so we you all the church brother Dale paid for us to bring them in by bus and by whatever how they could get there and we fed them a few meals rented this place and I believe we really had a good impact on what went on because I didn't have to travel all over the island number one number two we were all then you can go ahead and pull it up if you want to where we were this restaurant now this is a different place than where we were this is enclosed it does have an air-conditioner set it about 90 set it about 90 because that's about what it was but it was about 99 outside so it felt pretty good but these are all now some of them brought their wives they we're not supposed to do that but some of them just like us don't pay attention so some up but most of these all are message ministers now they have converted this is all message people they have converted to the message and they were in that some of the time at several of the twenty-something that come out some of these traveled and you'll see some of the tribal people go to the next slide okay [Music] this brother right here is the brother that's way down in South Palau and he's wondering I don't I told you about him because when we did the mystery Expo he had just just within the last month of being there came out of a denominational sure he was a Dean of a denominational Bible College him and his wife he was the Dean he feels real good at speaks real good English they had a house job place to work he accepted the message in within a month he was kicked out of the school and he was kicked out of his house they wasn't his house it was a house of the denomination they kicked him completely out well thanks to some of you brothers sitting here today you sent him enough funds to build him a church and it is I couldn't get a picture of it I tried of course we didn't go there but somebody had a picture and I wanted to get it but they never send it to me so but it is a I mean they sit on bamboo seats and it's probably about half the size of this and it's just bamboo strips for the walls and that's for the roof but it was about twenty two hundred dollars some of you brothers gave so now he has a church but he still does work I called him today before I left and he was huffing and puffing I said brother head what are you doing he said I'm climbing up a mountain going to see some people up and there's no roads eight-hour walk no roads going to visit the church they had established in the southern part of the island now this is brother Leto solo all of y'all most y'all remember Fantasy Island de plane de plane he looks just like he reminds me of but now when you say that over there they look at you like what are you talking about but he reminds me of that always always say duh blame but that's brother Leto solo we give him money every month and I'm telling you this guy is a worker he eats sleeps and breathes the message of the hour and he's a real good brother and he speaks then he speaks like eight different languages the island of Palawan has eight different dialects of one language so when you go in different parts you have to speak it he speaks them all so he's well received in Palau and he does do work in Mindanao he does do work in Manila but he's he's everywhere so we support him monthly with amount of money that some of us couldn't live off a week with he lives off a month so but you know what I finally got to meet his wife and I told her I said you know I was thinking in my mind I said I met you probably as much as your you met your husband in three years because he had not seen her in three months when we were over there three years ago we had not brother Leto was in Palau in for three months and he hadn't seen his wife in three months that's just the way they are in it well that brother Rolando brothers land land that came here his wife had a baby while he was gone didn't think a thing about it they're just a little different than we are yes but they have a passion for this message of the hour I promise you that and that's their life they cut everything out except that so let's go ahead and play that this is their saying you know these are all message pastors and preachers at the moment they're singing in English [Music] these brothers not dad those are the old in [Music] years old [Music] we brought them all in from the island and they all come to one place we fed them lunch that day there's a whiteboard you know me I love the whiteboard it's right over here we had a good time that's brother royal talking go to the next slide this brother right here I was making a point about something and this brother right here he he rides a motorcycle and he goes to church this church he's an evangelist but I want you to look that's his quote book I know somebody can't see that but he physically wrote quotes from brother Branham in this book can you make it a little bit bigger and yeah there you go he's got his Bible he's got it underlined and you know colored but he's reading quotes all for this book about that all right you do what you got to do all right let's come and that's his dad actually his daddy is one it's the 81 year old man now holder I expand it so we're in the middle of this this I'm up here speaking so we're in the middle of this of this thing I had that there everybody was sitting down except this brother right here this brother here he comes walking in and I said god bless you brother you look like a message believer to me I mean get short hair and didn't have an earring where he wasn't supposed to have it so he comes in and sits down well here I am and I'm talking and we're discussing how that God had through brother Branham had restored the faith of the fathers which were the original doctrines of water baptism no eternal hell no Trinitarian doctrine you know water baptism the name of Lord Jesus Christ brought all the major doctrines back well everybody was a man and in there you know they're reading their Bible and they're following me all through this and look they all have cell phones though they might not have a car if they got a cell phone but actually they have the message and the Bible in their cell phone so they carry that with them and that's what he's doing he's he's following me as we're reading the Bible so and it's like I was telling you before when I went over there I just really I took some quotes and I took some sermons but I really just didn't didn't read any quotes from brother Branham simply because these people some of them don't have all the quotes so we just stayed in the Bible but anyway so keep going so this brother keeps going keeps up now this is the same brother again now let me give you a secret you see this man right here he's 81 years old see that mop of hair he's got 81 now that's his son talking that's his son's up here talking he's a pastor for church and this his son's the Evangelist but I'd ask you myself what he speak he spoke pretty good English he I said what in the world did you do he said coconut oil he said I put coconut oil on my hair he said I eat coconuts I drink coconut milk coconut oil brother that's what keeps your hand you know if you'll do some research coconut oil is good for your hair anyway he's 81 and look I said well you're a picture of help do what yeah it's something Crick's dale or something old public market I don't know where he got that from that's his wife sitting behind him she had a question too she only has she had her arm took off because the cancer so she didn't have but a half arm we were talking about the second session we were talking about the change of the body because somebody to ask the question about it and she held that nub up she said well I have this I said no you won't have that no I see you won't have that all right go ahead so anyway that was after the first session but let me take go back just state leave it right there that's where we stayed that's kind of the bamboo but that guy that brother that was sitting over here when I got finished I said is there anybody got any questions I said brother what do you got he looked down he said what do you mean about this father son Holy Ghost baptism number two what do you mean there's no eternal hell I thought right then this guy in a message believer he said in number three he said what about he said what about this Trinitarian you know that brother about the Trinitarian doctrine so I went through and I explained and then that's when these other brothers began to help me explain to this brother about the major doctrines because he was a Trinitarian he was a I don't know what denomination he was but to tell you a little story when we got finished now eating a knew his Bible because he would say well what about what about the on the River Jordan where the Dove and the voice and there stands Jesus well that's the one Trinitarians use all the time you know you got the father talking out from here and and the Dove coming down the Holy Spirit and even the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism now though no eternal hell when he had a lot of scriptures about where the worm never dies and forever and ever and that's when this other brother got up and started helping me out with the with the one about the no eternal hell because he went through the Bible a little more than I D because I didn't think we had enough time but anyway after we got finished we come to find out back when General Marcos took over the Philippines and and created martial law he was a rebel against that so he was a Marxist and that's why he was so if you'll read about it read about Marx he was under the Marxist doctrine so he was he was comfortable with confrontation he didn't mind it cuz soon as I got you know as soon as I said anybody got a question I'm is like a spring went off you know and then he won't any sat there just like that though and he said go now what about and what about swimming well after about an hour he said well he said I see that you know your Bible he said god bless you thank you I'll you know I'll think on these things and he so when it's over he gets up and he walks back around and I'm shaking everybody's hand to go out brother well and I were standing there together and he looked at us and he said I've never run across the denomination like yours I thought well at least things I said were brother at least you know there's a difference we're not a denomination but at least you know we're different and I didn't know if he'd be back or not but you know what he came back the next day and went through the whole session the next day and really was listening he was intent so let's keep on going I'll tell you what he said later on keep going this is where we stayed it was a banner just a thanks to sister chichi it had no hot water so anyway in this room this is the courtyard this is kind of right here close to we were staying so this is what we were cos I leaned and don't ever go there but you know really I mean there was Americans there they there was really a lot of people from he was from he was British they go to this island too it's a real big resort town for people from Holland and New Zealand and all the other places like that so now these brothers right here are all tribal Indian preachers from the very south stop it right here I asked that kid I said how old are you and he had a look on his face I never seen before he did not know the day he was born and did not know how old he was this gentleman right here had to guess how old he was that's how far and I'll tell you about these brothers he brought they all came together and we had our session was over on Wednesday night a bunch of them got on the bus an air-conditioned bus and went back home these brothers would not do that they said we're not riding in an air-conditioned that cost a little bit extra he said they said because air conditioning makes us sick so they waited till the next morning they all slept somewhere I don't know where they piled up at they all slept somewhere and waited till this open-air Jeep comes by and takes them for hours back home anyway started back again but these these brothers these are from South South plowin original Island people they're all message preachers no stop it this brother right here is the Builder we give him if you'll remember last time it's been three years ago I can't remember the brother's name but he only needed nails he got plenty would swing away we bought ever how many kilos and nails back then well he has built six message churches since three years he's built six message churches and now he's starting on his own so I took some of the money brother Ryan I told you I was gonna take some of your money you said to give it to the people so I'm just gonna call you out that man now has enough nails to build his church and two more churches for just a couple of hundred dollars two hundred dollars bought enough nails for him to build three churches with LEC's nails but anyway that was a that was some of the money that we that we left over there but he finally is now building his own church so keep going but they're all they're all tribal people you see how they look they're really dark and they're really short but they all the ones that came from the Brahe of south part of the island of Palawan and that's him that's when I gave him the money and to build finished his church and and to others a couple others this is the second day session keep going and this is there's that same brother right there he comes back right there he comes back and gets a load gets a second load and there's mr. guy got all the hair in the world hey brother royal myself now that's uh that's the front of the motel that's some kind of bird kind of like our hummingbird but that's this that's the the older man's son he's the one with the motorcycle I gave him some money because he was know that wasn't him it's another brother but I gave him some money for traveling I gave brother Edward something for interpreting because he interpreted that's the one that had the Bible College that now he's kicked out but thanks be to God you know how God takes care of people his wife started her own private school and they're growing in numbers so I said man I said you can't outgive God God will bless you because when he was three years ago he was a little bit depressed I mean even though you told the message of the hour and saw the greatest thing there was you know his eyes were just open to the revelation of the message but he ain't had a place to live he didn't have a job and he had nowhere to go they literally kicked him off the campus and told him not to come back when he presented the message to the denomination and I'm not gonna call the denomination cuz it really doesn't matter but now he's established his wife he showed me many pictures of his wife that had a got a Bible School starting with a little bitty you know little small children had graduations and all that stuff because they're really educated hmm and he still does work on the island that's brother Leto and this is trying to think of his name but that's the brother that when he come to that place right there he told us brother whales taking the picture he told us he said brothers he said I he said I've been searching for truth he said I know there was more he said I went to the job was witness he saw went to one of the Jehovah Witness meeting he said they told me to be quiet you know hit me he was outgoing he was a Marxist this guy was a rebel so he he would ask questions freely they actually told him to be quiet he went over to that was Jehovah Witness he went over to seventh-day Adventist they told him he couldn't come in anymore so he goes over to a Life Church which is kind of a it's a big Church in port-au-prince s that kind of like our Jennsen Franklin's I don't mean to call his name but you know just a free chapel this is called life church so he goes into Life Church and he begins to ask them questions about certain doctrinal issues and he was he was confronted by the Deacons and said oh you've got to attend our church 14 services I don't know where they got 14 maybe they're in the 14th ceiling I don't know but they got you got a you got to come to our church 14 services before you can ask any questions he said they physically I was standing up he said a deacon physically grabbed me by Lee by the legs and set me down and told me to shut up he said but now he said when I walked into your place he said y'all so graciously answered every question I had told me with the love of the Lord he said he said whatever you got in other words it's not verbatim but whatever you got I have never seen it before he said every denomination and all the other churches I've been to I'll ask them certain things and said it's like you know the plague he said but you with open arms he said you answered all my questions you did not answer him out of out of anger you didn't he said you answered everything I asked and he said I've never found he said if I've seen the love of Christ I've seen it today that's what he said come and so that's good enough for me and brother well now he's brother rails on vacations right called hadn't bothered me but I'm gonna call him back they exchanged numbers there is a church in puerto princesa but there's like 20-something churches in in plowin so he's got a choice there we connected him with one of the pastors so we'll see but you know as far as one thing's for sure he knows he knows that we're different and that's that's the only thing I care is that somebody knows that we're different it's just it's like somebody was saying the other day to be christ-like is to be a Christian is to be christ-like are we Christian enough to be crops like you know that and that's a true statement and I think we as the collective group because what happened was I would because of the language now he spoke good English but but his number-one language this Tagalog so I left them kind of this brother here you know he he said can I say something I just said sure I said man here you know you speak his language so he goes so fast cuz I'd have to stop and somebody would interpret you know not have to stop and somebody have to interpret but this brother here he just rhyming he runs down through the Bible about the forever and ever and about eternal and about God and and you know the guy really understood and that's why in other words everybody was in unison with each other there was no argument and in the you know the 50 preachers so he saw that and he saw the love of God not just by words he saw actions so be being seeing the actions he he really enjoyed being there so that was the last this is kind of when is this this is the evening we didn't have an evening session because we want everybody to get home but this is right at porta princesa this is the this is the tourist section all the tourists here and then that's the that it's just a row of mountains kind of like it is in Jamaica you got your big mountains right in the middle of it but that's brother Edward and and brother for the Royal so go ahead this is just a little video of them kind of little boardwalk places to eat we found a little spot to eat down there all fresh fish obviously bird it's just a nice place I mean it's really not tough but you go five miles out of the out of the city and it's back to rural huts and shacks people so you it's a it's a tourist place but it's all just right there close together kind of like it is and all the other places even like Jamaica of it here you go to Montego Bay and you go sorryy ocean it's wonderful right inside that's where all the Americans go but you go outside with me and brother Dale go up in the mountains up in there and you're in a whole different world you're in you know jungle so we had a little bit of crab and a little bit of that's called a den awake that's a unicorn fish it grows a horn like a unicorn see everything but it grows on out they when they blackened did it cut stop it it was wailing out like this so we ate the other we ate a unicorn okay anyway it was unicorn fish all right go the next slide then we had a day to rest we went to the Palau win' wildlife rescue and conservation center so we just kind of took a day Thursday our flight went until later in the afternoon so brother Al and I he had never been to this place so we just took a time and asked some people where to go so this is that is a 16 and a half foot crocodile and that's his skin up here on the top - his - the head - the head the heads right here you know this parts on out here anyway I keep going so they raise crocodiles those are baby crocodiles so just keep going keep going just keep turning there's saltwater crocodiles that one's 15 feet long that one's 14 feet long that one's about 14 feet long and these these birds are mocking birds but they don't talk English so I would say something that go what just kidding that was kind of funny with it what the brother royal would talk to him in Tagalog like I love you into golly we some and he'd say that Ned say it's the same thing like I love you anyway this is this is from the Garden of Eden that's a bullet that's a albino boa constrictor thank God it was in the cage all right keep going yeah that's all snake every bit of that is yeah so anyway they had a little place this is a real crocodile those are real people so that's a real person I hate crocodile for lunch but that's a little one compared to the other then we go to this place here this is a he's kind of like was a senator but he got any good with the Americans he was a business owner but this is the place you go and he's already passed away but this is the place where we he's right on top of a hill and you can see all the way around so we took a few hours and went there so they had this beautiful flower arrangements they do those arrangements every day that's that's flowers floating in water they're not a tax just not but it's an arrangement that they physically hand make every day that's so really beautiful all right go ahead so now I think we are flying out Thursday and going to brother burnings I think it is the next one so here we meet up to eat that's brother LAN LAN you remember him myself brother burden lots of to bishops over there I'll tell you about in a minute but see right here brother Nestor so proud he is now on the committee Council of bishops of the Philippines he's he's a license and Archives bishop word message believers Ministries International and he's got a partner brother Vernon is now a license and there's Bishop they do that so they can move around the island a little bit better they can show that card and move around the island a little bit better and not hassled by because look anytime Council of Bishops of the Philippines that's not that's the name of the place that's not what they came up with that's the name is endtime Council of Bishops of the Philippines and it gives them rights to marry and give them rights to do funerals and it's kinda like you know in Jamaica brother Keith was was supposed to have one of them remember but brother skyress does the he does it under his license well they've got their own license now where they can do that so I'm thinking about getting me one but so brother burnin on Friday night he has a Bible study and it's at a whole listen I mean it's at a business not too far from that Center of where you were a couple of buildings over this guy right here is the like vice-president of the whole company and he got brought into the message about a year ago brother burning through some people connected with him and brought actually brother Royals daughter worked for him for a time because she's a she's a Waco civil engineer engineer so this is before the church started we're at brother burnings and he said well we're having Friday night service said just come over and you can speak for us because I wasn't gonna be there during a during a a weekend service go ahead next there we are singing in English again so now we're speaking and then we used we had a little board over here we could use it and I took revelations five and the whole theme of the whole part I wanted to let people know was just like I've been trying to tell all of you guys and all of us here we are not a second person of a Trinity we're not a second person of nothing we are the person of Christ made manifest in another form called the bride we are the I am of the day amen we came from God we go back to God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us this the word made was made flesh and dwelt among us and if that's too hard for you to swallow then you got a real problem because it's like I was telling them downstairs if we keep going into this social gospel that we've been in for 50 years I'm sorry of hair and dress and do's and don'ts and that's not in the other we're gonna sure we're holding those peoples but we're gonna just die and go by the grave and then it's just going to keep going but listen there's not another generation this is it so we must brother branham I did not take this quote with me but I've heard the other day you've heard it a hundred times and I've heard it a hundred times a thousand times when the bride realizes who she is right and what she's doing here but now what's what's another quote brother Brown says when the bride begins to say I and my father are one and these other things so it's obvious that they hadn't been saying it before when the bride starts to say I and my father are one and these other things the shuck will pull away well that's what's going to happen I'll promise you this church any church you see people falling away that shucks the original seed word will absolutely be the seed word and we will receive the seed word and it will not harm us to say I and my father one it will not harm us to say I am that I am but I know my position that's what I was telling them there in revelations five you got one sitting on the throne but you got one taking the book from the one sitting on the throne same person but it's just positions and we know our position where there's no way we can be the physical God no that's not what I'm saying but because he's inside of me once he goes inside of you how can you find him and separate him from you again we were separated we were alienated alienated from God before our new birth but by the new birth you and I are sons and daughters of God we are God made manifest in another form called the bride we are the I am of the hour we are the Joshua generation we are that group of people that's going to say I and my father are one now how close is that I and my father are one and these other things the show could pull away because you know what's going to happen the shuck won't be able to chew it Chuck won't be able to swap swallow the shuck will be have to pull away to show the true grain and the true grain is the ones that can stand in the end time and say I come from God I go back to God and then I taught him our little slogan who's gonna take a body change I am I am it's gonna do the body changing I can't change my body you can't change your body but the I am can change your body and when you become the I am on the earth because there's not gonna be another I am here I hope y'all catch up with us on my all in all he's all in all in in us this too this used to be owned by somebody else now God owns this Amen God owns this now the whole thing that's why brother Brown stood one day and said I found out I'm not the son of Charles and Ella brento now look he and take a body change right then right he died and went on by the grave called he was prophesying but you and I must realize that our mom and dad is sure that brought us here but once God comes in and I saw a sign in the Philippines and I should have took it it says we vulcanize here I should have took that picture brother John you remind us we ever go back over there I'm cuz we drove by and I thought what did that sign say we've all connives here remember brother branham said you vulcanized when God comes in he vulcanized itself with you but what does he do takes rubber and rubber and vulcanized it together you can't pull it apart no more that's why some will be able to catch it in some wall and there's some that don't want take a body change that's just the way it is I miss just this message was not to help us live better this message come to the message the Prophet brought was to change our body it was to change our nature and change our body and give us a new way of thinking now like I said that's the essence of this message the essence of this message is to get our bodies lined up with what's already inside of us what's already inside of us all right so that's kind of what I brought to them even the revelations 5 how that the book being worthy and the one that took the book was worthy so the book obviously must be worthy so we'll get into that revelations 5 Bella's not here but that's Bella when she was a baby brother Royale has that now that

the next time that book appears the pray that you just bless warning in nor do we have any that was Sunday morning and I'll tell you something about Sunday morning sister Chi Chi leaned over to me and she said we're not having no famous preacher here no more I said well when's he showing up what happened was a lot of people heard that I was coming so in other words this just Sunday morning supposed to only have been about like 150 to 200 their regular regular people and then they were gonna feed them and then have the meal for 600 that night there was 400 people showed up that morning they had feed them and had to go get some more food for the 600 coming that night so she said went go handle more famous preachers in here in the morning I said well we won't we when he shows that will well talk about it alright this is the evening service singing all singing in English that's for the Royals daughter Colin with the market [Music] and then that's brother where else talking about the now his dad they rolled him out there and gave him the microphone and he's got a little bit of dementia at 86 he's probably got a lot of other things but that's okay this guy starts preaching brother rails standing behind him going get the microphone get the microphone so a guy reaches over from here and grabs a microphone we order seen the look on his face when that guy can grab the microphone the guy gets the microphone and he's going like what I just getting started but that's brother rails dad and they gave him plenty of that's brother Rock that's brother Rocky's son and then that's a collage they did that's coming out and preached that evening that's all ministers in the back they got people here sitting in the balcony they got about 300 people on this side over here mm-hmm outside the outside the church what would come to this you can't hear good because I had on the lapel pocket anyway we preached a little bit later that's okay we'll try they were presenting their brother Roy Allen for 40 years reserve the use of the service you're a Libra question for the ministry and mr. desire to share the gospel of creation picture us a royal great people who have a keyboard IRS sacrifices the blood will be given your faithful leadership the friendship your humility in your interact uncompromising stand for the message of the our integrity how beautiful are the people of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of evil things from an event on this special day of the 40th anniversary got a real good quorum enlarger to do something so now that church like mission might be late for sure--they I was telling while he's talking to understand what he's saying say something the money we've said and we send more proud of those bill things that you do anywhere but the money is not for them to have fineries they take every dime of that and they turn it back into mission work every dime of it goes to mission where brother burning gives us a complete list of all the things that's used for and it's not to buy fineries for their self it's to use to go do the mission work this is brother Leto and this is his wife that's brother Rocky's oldest son how old do you think he is okay he's 45 yes he's 45 years old because he's the oldest he's 45 42 and 35 I think yeah they all look like babies I said you can't be brother Rocky's son not oldest son but yeah he's the this one took over for brother rocky when he died I know some of you don't know brother rocky but he was he was kind of our favorite he was a he was a tall Filipino and he could sing and he just had a nature that was just smooth he's preached here a couple of times sang some songs were brother Danny here when they came by one time anyway this is what they gave me difficult appreciation appreciate your tireless effort administering to the saints in the Philippines for your dedication to the mission and for being our brother and friend thank you so that's when they gave it to me they didn't show that on there but anyway so now go the next one which is nothing that's it monday was a rest day they put me up we always this is this kind of a tradition you saw sit first when we were all meeting when we first got there what we usually do is is we sit down and you know me I don't like to just say it is what it is hmm I don't like to even like that phrase but no I don't I want to go over there with an agenda I want to go over there know what we're gonna do who's gonna pick me up I'm kind of like mom in the way that way I want to know what time we need to leave what time we got to get there so brother Nestor brother Danny brother burnin sittin over here brother Rael he'd always he'd already flown to Saigon so he was gone but usually we meet together when we begin and we meet together when we leave so this is at a Pizza Hut they wanted to feed me some American food before we left I guess pizzas not an American food and I said this is not American food this is Italian food so anyway but we met there and there's some of the other brothers this is the brother here that this is brother this is brother don don he lives at dingle on he's got a church there that brother George Quinn helps with this is brother that was he's in with in the military with brother Vernon and he's one it helped me get in that real nice motel that we stayed in so look these guys this this is a five-star hotel in a casino sorry but they bought it for me they all took up money and bought that room for me and it was I don't know how much it was but these two brothers are the this is the head of security and he's a deacon and a song leader and brother brother Vernon's church and this brother is the deacon and brother burners church I think he's a deacon if not he sees he's something important but they are the head of security for that whole in 2014 when this hotel was built in Cassino brother Vernon they called him in to do lay out all the security the cameras the video everything was set up by brother burnin so everybody in that hotel knows brother burning well he got these two brothers job there so he became now the second-in-command in the whole place the whole unit and he's third in command so when I pull up I pull up him brother Vernon's car obviously everybody knows brother Burnham but these two guys reaching get me out of the car and they got their little you know little FBI things on you know and they grabbed me and they grabbed my equipment you know my stuff and we they take me right over and put me in front of the the desk to check in and I'd have to say a word they say well we need the room key I mean he just got the kid and then they turned me around and walked me into the elevator walk me up into this room and stood at the door for a minute you know till I got everything in and I'm like yeah baby this is good cuz I remember last time I stayed there I stayed at brother royal Sunday night well from brother or elles to the airport it's not but 15 miles but it takes you two hours to get there like I always said you know you don't get anywhere fast in the Philippines so my flight was early so we had to leave it's um I mean like 4 o'clock in the morning and I had just finished doing that service had been three weeks I was a rung out right well brother Vernon said well well I set it up where I could leave on Tuesday at about 12 o'clock I'll tell you story about that and I'll be done I won't have to do this on Wednesday it's four o'clock but anyway they put me up in this motel five minutes from the airport actually from that casino they built like they did in Journal motors they built a complete ramp that goes right from the motel right over into the airport so I was right I mean he this brother here picked me up at 7:30 in the morning and I was in the airport in less than five minutes I checked in and ready to go I was so rested this place was the night the bed was just fabulous place to sleep so and they I wanted I told them I'd pay for it they said no lighting is really bad but that's some of the brothers that we that we met there but this is the room I said I'm gonna show this to everybody but I have my robes bathrobe toilet hot water I got in that tub for about two hours they had two little backs all in all I staggered pictures ahead of security in the second-in-command yeah it's pretty believers and the airport's just right there I mean you could see the planes taking off from before you work here but I tried my best to pay for this room I had a little bit of money left over a brother burning said no you've done enough for us here I doubt there was any heat they don't need it but and I started to take a picture I opened up the I opened up the reload medium refrigerator Seagram's check daniels in that refrigerator yeah but that is the compass not it's not complementary you got to buy it but they had beer and everything in there they had lager and also they open it yeah they'd open open I said man so anyways so this is what we went and had this supper that night and it was totally paid for by the by the believers over there and that's the brother that he was working a head of security he was working and at that moment we got to meet there was an Australian guy I mean his guys about six six he was the general manager for all Hyatt motels in the Philippines and all of that asian group really important guy he knew brother burn him because brother burning had to deal with him for several months setting up all the security stuff in this hotel this is a Hyatt Hotel they wanted a Hyatt Hotel but because they wanted an American presence because they weren't Americans come and spend the money in the casino so they put a hot hotel actually there's three hotels attached to that middle part of the casino this one's on this side there's another one that's a Filipino one on this side and I don't know what this one is on this side but a lot of people were there a lot of foreigners like Americans and all but then we flew out and Tuesday morning and I'll tell you a little story about that because the International Dateline is right over here somewhere somewhere close and so when I got up at 7:30 out of that Motel I got up at 7:30 we ate at 7:30 Goff at 6 o'clock watch the Sun come up now this is Tuesday morning Sun come up on Tuesday morning I'm

so we are pleased to be back good to be back Wow it was a good trip though but I wanted to make it so simple but yet we covered seals we covered revelations 5 we covered you know what enough wasn't any vanilla it was a the meat of the word that's what they need they need the meat of the word you talk about refreshing when you stand in front of 50 message pastors or preachers and none of them had been in the message over like five years they all came from those mystery expose that brother rollout went over there before me before we were over there he did some mystery expose then we did the ones when I was there and then they've done in one or two after that they they've gleaned 50 new message churches that are like 5 years and younger on that one island now me that's phenomenal it would never happen in the United States you know that but there it's just like they just keep giving reports of another church being built in another church being in other words being established and you know I kind of thank God that they kick them all out I really do you know if we sometimes if we'd get kicked out of someplace it'd make you feel better but with them it's the same word we got they got to grow just like we grow they do not have the facilities we have now we did give them remember we get wheat y'all bought 50 tablets they have warm out three years they've warming it only had the message on it was a little tablet about this big that the message was on and they've warm out some of them said they just warm out and the battery doesn't even work anymore so we may want to try to discuss later on there was no no one asked for it it's just they told me that they had war some of them out and that's just for the message there's no other apps or anything is just for the message now voice 'god is doing that now so we might try to i'll get rid of the job and we'll talk about blessed and our feet god bless you thank you for your patience thank you number one for your prayers and your support without your support i couldn't have done this and the support of the church thanks to brother Dale who's this mission minded there's any message Church preacher I know of and brother
