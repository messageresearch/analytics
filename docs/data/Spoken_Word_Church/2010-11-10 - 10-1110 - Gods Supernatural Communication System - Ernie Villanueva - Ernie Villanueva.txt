amen that's the grand desire of every believer every son and daughter of God that's come into a walk with Christ and uh one day that promise is going to be made manifest in our lives I'd like you to be seated just for a couple of minutes I'd like to give give you a quick update on what's taking place in the mission field um we sent out these Faith challenge reports I don't know did they arrive at your assembly Brother Sam great um I I can tell you that to me over the last year or so the whole the whole process of getting the message out into the hands of people all over the world has taken a just a Quantum Leap and uh the the message Hub it it basically is uh it's a multi-lingual operation and uh what what it does is it takes the library resource of brother brandom's message in both voice and print format and puts it into the hands of people even people in third world countries who are living out in in thatched Huts who have no access to the internet if they have a computer it doesn't have to be a real fancy computer and if they have one of these printers then uh we send them a dis and that dis has every message in every language available to them and they just plug it in and every month a new disc is sent to them and right now there's over50 of these Message Hubs that are located in various parts all over the world and uh right now on an average of every two weeks over 1,000 cities from 100 count countries around the world connect to the message Hub and download brother bram's messages uh just recently in our assembly we have had we have had two explosive spurts with our young people one of them was they wanted to take every message and you know many people when they come into the the revelation of Truth uh they just assume that all the messages are available and and you can just go to any message you want to but there are there are almost 700 messages that have never been printed they've never been put into a a print form and you can get them when you go on onto the computer you can find them and you can you know download them onto your computer but uh and many of the people who have translated we take it for granted sometimes because the message came in English and I am so thankful the message came in English I I'm in awe at at brother like brother milco from our assembly anywhere he goes all over Europe whether it's German or Italian or or Slovakian or Serbian he can speak he can speak enough of their language and within a short time God just puts them in that channel where they can they can communicate so I'm I'm thankful for people who can speak many many languages you know God only gave me one one language and uh you know a couple of I can count in a couple of languages and I can say how are you and you know thank you and a few other things but many people they are just waiting with breathless anticipation for a new message to come their way right and at this at this present time there are over 5,000 messages that have been translated in 44 languages and by the end of this year there will be over uh we expect to have 6,000 messages available in 50 languages amen and uh what what these messages have done in the beginning we had to have the printer and and you know it's always the cost factor and the cost Factor was the toner and the toner sometimes for a printer can cost $200 and uh we had a brother in Mexico and I'm so thankful for the creative imagination that comes with a burden and a vision to get the message up cuz this brother figured out he looked at that toner and he said there's no reason why I can't just take a little a little punch and I can't punch a hole in that toner and we can't get uh powdered ink and we can't fill that toner up with powdered ink which is what it's got in it in the first place and all they do is take a piece of tape and put that over it and that toner is now good to print about a th000 new messages and the cost of the the the uh the powdered ink is $16 as opposed to $200 so uh we just sent over 50 consumable kits over to the Philippines and these brothers with the ink that they have now got they're they they have the capacity to print 100,000 messages amen so just pray that that God will give them the burden and God will take that message and send that message to the to the right people uh brother brother Murphy has been been very very busy over the last couple of years and and uh he he's got a whole team of people in China and and they're working on the phones back and forth every day they you know they they they get a book one translates it and he sends it over to another brother he proofreads it then they grammar eyesee it then they correct it and then it's all ready to go and and and they're producing like sometimes a book A Day translated book a day and right now 450 message titles are now available in the Chinese language just over the last couple of years and brother Murphy has personally done 306 audio voice overs where brother brandom's voice and then Murphy's voice and brother Brandon's voice and Murphy's and you know to to the people in China that that is a it's a tremendous tremendous blessing to those people many of them have never heard the name Jesus Christ one time in their life brother Murphy was just over there and they were trying to get the message cood they were trying to get it printed they went to three different printers in three different parts of the country to get quotes and then they got a text message shortly after that and one of the brothers or one of the men who was who was giving them the quote had a print shop he sent back a message and he said is there anybody in the world who can baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because what it happened was he went to the website he went to the website and he downloaded the messages and he began to he began to read them and then uh uh an an illness struck his eye you know what pink eye is right how how many ever had pink eye okay well he got pink eye his wife got pink eye his whole family got pink eye and he had to stay home from work for two weeks and in that two weeks he downloaded 140 messages and he and his wife were reading messages for 10 to 12 hours every day in in the message and then the man was so he was so gripped he he belongs to one of the government churches a three self church and it's like a it's like a Catholic Church basically is what it is but uh you know they're self-governing self-propagating and self-supporting and that's how China says we have religious freedom in the country but it's dead as a doornail and so this man he is he is a high official he's in charge of all the evangelism all the Outreach all the books that go out all the material that come this man is in charge of it and now the message comes into his hands and he is gripped with the fact that a prophet has come and he starts passing this message out to all the people in the church well you can imagine the church leaders are not too happy with him right now and they haven't given him the left foot of Fellowship yet but he knows he's on the way out but he doesn't he doesn't care he says I'm going to stay here until they kick me out but at the same time I will not compromise the stand and every body I come in contact with I am going to tell them the most important news that I have ever heard or any human being has ever heard and that is that God has sent Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and that's our mandate that's our mission that should be our great Magnificent Obsession is to have our hearts turned back to the faith of the fathers and that can only come one way God knew that that to turn the hearts back to the faith of the fathers that he had to come once again in a Vindicated prophet and that Prophet would be able to come and preach the word and unveil Christ to the people and demonstrate Christ to the people in a way that had that had not been done since the day that Christ walked on the earth and in a greater measure Christ like brother brandom said Jesus did more in just one of his meetings than is recorded in the entire Bible now we know the Bible said you know if all the works that Jesus had done were recorded all the the you know the libraries of the the books of the world would not be able to hold them but we know there was many many hundreds of thousands of healings and dramatic Supernatural events that took place in the life of the prophet and that's that's what the people need they need to see that they need to hear that they need to hear that voice and uh my little book go here oh th this is the latest thing this is this is something we never knew this printer would do and it was again all these 150 print operators each one of them brings a little bit of a different element to the table a little bit of a different knowledge a little bit of different experience a little wisdom and uh and so they have now got this book down to a pocket siiz book where you can just take it and just put it right into your pocket just just like that and have it available and ready to hand out and the cost of a book like this is 5 cents that means for a dollar you can print 20 of these books and and I was showing at the Sam and if anybody wants to look at it after the service you're more than welcome and the print is very very good very readable and these these can be produced 100 of them in an hour can be produced and and the large siiz books if somebody wants a full-size book they can be produced for 10 cents a book and uh there's there's there's no no Transportation cost no Customs no Duty uh you know no distribution none of that everything is available if a brother has got a computer and he's got a printer and uh and of course a a a a cutter and a stapler goes with that but he is a Onan Supernatural printing operation he's got the word available to put into the hands of the people and uh and so if you would pray that we'd be able to to get these you know and it's so simple all somebody's got to do is they got to go to www messut messag hub.in and they just opens up and whatever language you want to look at you can look at that language then you go to the year that you want to then you go to the message that you want to and they just print they just push that button for that message and the printer just takes and prints it out so if a pastor wants to have a a message that they've never had before and they want to be able maybe to play brother brandom's voice and have the people in the congregation be able to read a book that they've never ever ever had access to before that is now available and I'm sure you folks have been in services like that and you've heard brother Brandon preach and be able to read it and you get it both ways you get it in the eye gate and you get it in the ear gate and it goes to that mind gate goes down to the heart gate real quick and uh and so the this this whole message Hub can be delivered to Africa India uh in the Spanish countries right now the Spanish is the most active group of people we have anywhere in the message over 200 Spanish messages are downloaded every day that's just what we know from the website now there may be many of these people who are just putting the disc in there and just downloading them right from the disc and we don't have any any knowledge of them and so we can take one of these whole systems and put it into a church for $1,200 and so that that person now becomes he becomes a printer of the most Supernatural message that the world has has ever known so uh we thank you for your support over the years brother the Bisal asked me to send his greetings and his thanks to you we're just in meetings in uh in Murphy's Boro over the weekend and we had a wonderful time and uh brother Murphy also asked me to send greetings and brother milco also I don't know if all of you people know know them but they were at the meetings several years ago in Gainesville and uh you know people are still talking about what a wonderful that was one of the most wonderful meetings we've ever had anywhere at any time and uh you know I I'll never forget you know mo most times when you go into a meeting uh there has to to be there has to be expenses and usually the expenses are taken out of the offering and and and and the rents paid and you know all the all the uh expenses for the meeting are paid but your church was the first church that I know of that didn't want to have any any of the offering go to anywhere but to missions your church paid for the building your church paid for for for for everything to make that meeting happy and and we never forget that and I know brother Ed will never forget that we we appreciate that amen and uh so I maybe I'd like to just read something to you uh this is It's entitled the preacher who would be wrongly judged and uh one of the toughest toughest tasks the church faces is choosing a new Minister a member of an official board undergoing this painful process finally lost patience he'd watched the Pastoral Rel committee reject applicant after applicant for some fault alleged or otherwise so it was time for a bit of soul searching on the part of the committee so he stood up and he read a letter reporting to be from another applicant for the position of the pastor at the church it read like this gentlemen understanding your Pulpit is vacant I should like to apply for the position I have many qualifications I've been a preacher with much success and have had some succcess as a writer some say I'm a good organizer and I've been a leader in most places where I've been I am however over 50 years of age and I have never preached in one place for more than 3 years in some places I have left town after my work as caused riots and disturbances I must admit I've been in jail three or four times but not because of any real wrongdoing I'm my part my health is not too good although I still get a great deal done the churches I have preached in have been small though located in large cities I've not gotten along very well with the religious leaders in the towns where I have preached in fact some have threatened me and even attacked me physically I'm not too good at keeping records and I have been known even to forget whom I have baptized however if you can use me I shall do my best for you yeah so the board member looked over the committee and he said well what do you think shall we call him and the good folks were a gassed and said what call an unhealthy troublemaking absentminded ex jailbird was the board member Crazy who signed the application who had such colossal nerve and the board member eyed them keenly before he answered and he said it signed the Apostle Paul and so uh what a paradox and uh people would have to have a real paradigm shift to be able to to to to look beyond the cover and to see what was lying behind that cover God bless you let's stand to our feet and I'd like to invite you to open your Bibles to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 1 before we read let's pray father we count this a a great privilege to come before you as your children we come with with reverence and humility and sincerity but yet Lord we come as children who understand that you have made an entrance for us that we can come boldly before the throne of grace and Lord we know that you are a high priest sitting at the right hand of majesty waiting to make good any of the confessions that we make that are according to the Redemptive blessings of the Resurrection in the word so Lord we ask that you would lead and guide and direct us tonight I pray father that you would take my lips use them as a Pulpit for your word I pray that you would hide all flesh for All Flesh will come to not father we don't come with human AB ability we just depend upon the unction and the anointing of your Holy Spirit to speak what needs to be spoken so Lord I pray that each person would come in great anticipation and expectation with their cups ready to be filled from the Bounty of your blessings we ask all all these things Lord all these petitions in your precious and wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Ephesians 1 and verse 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now in order for a person to really internalize that scripture they have to have an upto-date revelation of justification I am so thankful of justification without that you know without that a person could go no further without that the guilt and the shame and the condemnation and the humiliation of our past it would be it it would be something that the devil would use to come and torment us on a regular basis as he did through many many many years when I was in denominations you know you go to church you get all filled up and then during the week you'd come back and you feel like you had to go back to the altar again but when the revelation of justification and an upto-date experience that you have been cleansed and purified and that you have been called before the foundation of the world and God sees you as a holy virtuous blameless bride of Jesus Christ to get that understanding and that Revelation and to have that Armor of God on so when the Devil comes with his attacks you've got your armor of God on and you can just come and you can step on that Serpent's neck I know every day when I wake up there's got to be two deaths I got to die and the devil's got to and so I say I'm going to die early and the devil's going to die early just get it over right first thing in the morning shut that yapping dog up right first in the morning put him in his place and move on and do what God has called you to do for that day having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glory wherein Heath made us accepted in the beloved he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through the blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded to us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will I'd like to speak tonight about the supernatural communication system that God uses to his children so having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will in verse 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance and the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us with who believe according to the working of his mighty power amen God bless you you may have your your seats now each one of us who studies this word and understands what God has done in this day you become a Believer now a believer of this message is a superintelligent being with a Divine Purpose in your life God knew you before the foundation of the world he knew each one of us God knew that I would be standing here tonight God knew every every person that would be here tonight he knows what your needs are and each person here is at a different stage of growth and development some here are in need of Salvation some are in need of Deliverance some are in need of healing some are in need of Direction some are some are in need of of of knowing what God's perfect will is for our life and and and and and that should be something that consumes and possesses and absorbs us when you come to the revelation of this truth we know that it wasn't us going looking for God it was God who came looking for us but then when God found us now God he encouraged us and exorts us to seek after him diligently with all of our heart with all of our mind with all of our soul with every with every fiber of our being to search after God he's worthy he's worthy of all praise all honor and all glory without him we would be nothing but with him we can do all things greater is he that is in us than he that is that is in the world and uh in in the the church age book this is something is very familiar but I I just want to start with this brother brandom said you recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church is work in the future ages then I mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it think of the hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of preachers around the world who study and go to church on Sunday some most of them only go to church once a week sometimes twice a week I'm so thankful we go three or four times a week but but think of these people and the pastor he goes He studies he prays he thinks he has a thought for the people the people come the church thinking that the pastor has a word for them that's going to encourage them and they have faith and confidence in their pastor and the pastor has faith and confidence that he has heard from God but of all those hundreds of thousands or millions of preachers who preach the sermons every sermon they preach this year last year for the last five or 10 or 20 years not one of those sermons has ever produced a new birth right because the new birth brother Brandon says there's one evidence of the new birth and that is that you can receive the revelation of truth that God has sent for your day and manifest the life right and they can't do it right they're not they're not preaching the message they have no knowledge of the message and so they preach and people come forward maybe they have an experience with God you know but that that's between them and God they they may be foolish virgins we we don't know that they may they may do something good for the and be our brother and sister in heaven we don't these these things are in God's hands but what I'm saying is these people cannot have the experience that God has made available to you it's a treasure it's an inheritance that God has given to us and it's not something that we should take lightly this is this is the greatest opportunity you'll ever have in your life but it also has the great accountability and the great responsibility and that word responsibility if you break it down response ability do you have the ability to respond to the gospel and only a Son of God only one with a c Gene of God inside of them has the the the opportunity and the availability to respond to the word in a favorable manner glory and so I mention it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we'll fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you'll see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people now the devil may beat you down the devil may tell you every sin you ever committed that's his job that's his he's got that right brother brandom talked about he said you can't prevent the birds from flying overhead but you can't you can't prevent the birds from making a bird's nest in your hair your head and so the devil has access to our mind but we have power to cast down memory cast down imagination cast down reason cast down everything that exalted itself against the knowledge of God it's a weapon that God has placed in the hands of a Believer and you must take that authority over the devil don't take that Authority lightly don't let the devil bully you there's a lot of talk about bullying going on in schools nowadays there's a lot of bul going on by the devil every day and he gets away with it by people who don't know their position in Christ right it will take a special class of people it'll take one with prophetic Insight it'll require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know I'm so thankful that that that that God has opened opened the message the message to me now you may have heard me say this before but it's real to me the message is a supernatural multiplication of inspiration and Revelation for communication with God God has opened up access to us just like just like Jacob he saw the angel you know going up the ladder God has given us that same privilege to go up that ladder go up seven steps God has given the to go up Seven Church ages to go up Seven Seals know other people on the face of the Earth you think about it friends many of the people who followed brother brandom's Ministry in the late 40s when the Great Revival the great healing Revival was spawned and they followed him during the 50s and oh my all over the the religious world I'm not saying the World At Large but many in the religious World said oh God has raised up a great man of God amongst us and those who were inclined to know about the things of God they were aware of brother brandham and his presence and the stories that they had heard about him but in 1958 when he preached the seed of the serpent friends it caused millions of people who had a favorable impression of brother brandham to go away right and brother brandham says sometimes you have to say things to thin out the crowd because there's too many following the message now that's a paradox because here we are we want to do everything we can to get the message out but at the same time the message many times says things to them that makes them go away like the 70 Jesus commissioned them he ordained them he sent them out they had power they cast out demons they come back rejoicing and Jesus said don't Rejoice because of that but Rejoice of your name is written in the Book of Life he said unless you drink this blood and eat this flesh you have no part with me and and and brother Bron that staggered him and he says oh does that stagger you what are you going to do when you see the son of man ascending and descending from where he came from they said that's it we are out of here right y bye-bye and Jesus he never said now hold on guys just wait wait you know it'll come clear to you in a while I I'll explain it to you I I'll help you I'll help you to understand no they just walked away and Jesus turned to the other Apostles and said will you also go away and they said Lord where would we go you have the words of eternal life right and so God comes and God through his Supernatural Communications system I'd like to just read one one verse of scripture for you it's in Amos 3 and verse 1 uh and and I'll just go quickly I don't I want to preserve time hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you oh children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt saying you only have I known of all the families of the earth you know we can we can take that that's a type of us we are the only ones that God has known the only ones that God has become intimate with spiritually and supernaturally intimate with the other ones are going to come and when they come to Jesus he's going to say depart from me you that worketh iniquity for I never knew you I never become intimate with you you were never pregnated with my spirit with the Holy Spirit you are pregnated by a man's Spirit you're pregnated by a denominational Spirit which is simply the mark of the beast brother the brandom said that when some little group that started off became the monstrosity of Satan that's what they are they might look good have nice temples you know have nice churches call themselves nice names have you know beautiful choirs all dressed up have TV broadcast radio broadcast do good things feed the poor visit the sick go to the prison do all those things but they are doing it all in the power of the flesh under an anointing a man-made anointing sure that's right it's not something God you know brother Brandon brings it out God said go and preach the gospel he didn't say go build hospitals and go build schools and go build Bible uh seminaries and the the the more a person goes to Bible school or seminary School the further away from God they go it take you know brother random said when the Fire gets lit that's when a man should go out and preach the gospel and especially anybody who's in the message you're in the school of the prophets every time you come to church and you hear this message preached by an anointed minister of this message you are in the school of the prophets you we have children who are eight and nine and 10 years old they can out preach Billy Graham they can out preach all the men that are on television they know how many gods there are they know what happened in the garden they know they know how to be baptized they know all these things they know the prophet of God is in this day they know how to dress you know brother Murphy was talking uh just after he left one of the meetings when he was in China it was the very place that two years ago that that the the the women were arrested and 30 women they went to jail because they were wearing skirts mous Tong when he came into Power he had all them dressed alike men and women all dressed the same and for a woman to have a dress on only prostitutes wore dresses and yet these sisters when they heard the message even though they knew in their culture they were going to be looked upon as a prostitute now I know some people look at you and think you're oldfashioned yeah it's a lot different from being thought of being oldfashioned and being looked at as a prostitute that's right see and and and these sisters were arrested and they were thrown in jail for a month for wearing dresses and as soon as they were released from jail they went right back and got their sewing machines and got their needle and thread and sewed more dresses and they've been wearing those dresses ever since and by the grace of God they have not been deterred although they still looked on with reproach but they consider that an honor to Bear the reproach of God you know somebody might think they look at you and your long dress and your long hair they said oh that's the oldfashioned model no that's not the oldfashioned model that's the Eternal model that's what it is Heaven's going to be full of that that's right amen and so yet you only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities can two walk together except they be agreed will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he hath taken nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon the Earth where no gin is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken Nothing At All Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the Lord hath not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his Secrets unto his servants the prophets and in this day friends in our day God has done wonderful things in our day first of all he has he has introduced uced us to a supernatural civilization through his life through his ministry and even later on in his ministry when he still thought you know didn't know had had no idea what was going to happen in the next life was he going to be a cloud was he going to be a cloud floating around and and maybe say hi brother Neville hi brother Brandon you know I mean think about that a man who had those kind of experiences with God and an angel of the Lord came and instructed him and taught him and showed him in the Bible you have to you have to fulfill this scripture you have to fulfill this scripture you have to fulfill this scripture imagine having an angel of the Lord for your teacher for your instructor and yet still you know it was a progressive revelation that brother brandham had all the way up to the end of his ministry I so appreciate the humility of a man who can look at what he taught before and for one one example he used to teach Body Spirit Body Soul Spirit Body Soul Spirit but at the end of his ministry he corrected himself it is Body Spirit soul the soul is the inner Court the soul is the holy of holies where you dwell and God comes in and takes a hold of that control tower and if he controls the soul the soul will control the spirit and the spirit will bring the body under control brother brandom he said says therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been en tyed and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and he shows it and and God's help will see it right here this morning what the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what has been to know this and then try to bring it to the people can you imagine the pressure on one man a human being especially one that the devil continually beat him up over his education over his lack of an ability to speak and and and the ridicule that other people poured on him there was one there was one man and he was a believer of this message and I met met him one time he came to Vancouver and we were talking and and he said he said oh he said brother branam he says I love the message he said but brother brandham he sure slaughtered the queen's English yeah and I said well he might have Slaughter the queen's English but he knew The King's English real good that was the important thing to know amen and so so brother brandom says he says uh he saids do you like to read between the lines he said why the best part of the Bible is wrote between the lines sure it is and can you imagine going to a Bible school and says well you know I I learn by reading between the lines you know they wouldn't accept that no but when you look at the Bible God gives a supernatural eag Insight a vision that that only comes by Revelation and Revelation is a gift and brother BR said it can never be overemphasized the importance of Revelation we need it more we we need it on a continual basis you know it's wonderful when when you come to church and a and a Gifted Man stands behind the pulpit and preaches and and and and opens up something in the word that you never saw before but it's more wonderful to be able to go into the message yourself and be able to read it and let God begin to open things up to you and God start to put all the pieces together and and it fits everything together like a hand goes into a glove and you know it's a personal a personal encounter that you have had a supernatural encounter that you have had with deity that he has exposed himself to you as I told you the other night the Bible is hid from every Seminary you don't know God by the Seminary experience you know him by a born again experience that's the only that's the only way that it comes brother brandom says now I'm a typologist now this this is the shocking statement he says I am a typologist and any man that knows the Bible is a typologist how can you imagine I I talked to a brother uh it was about 10 years ago but this brother had been preaching for 15 years in the message and he just came across that quote and he said you know I just read where brother brandom said if a man's going to know the Bible he's going to be a typologist he said I better start studying the types I am so thankful friends that God has given us types and and God has said this type is for you right amen God has shown us what happened in in heaven he showed us that onethird of all the Angels were there and Lucifer was the most beautiful he was the most gifted he was the most anointed and he was successful in deceiving one thir of all the angels in heaven into leading a rebellion against God now did that take God by surprise absolutely not God knew it God knows everything he's omnipotent he's omnicient he's omnipresent and he can predestinate by for knowledge he knows each one that's his they're engraved in the palm of his hand not if you were there in the in the mind of God before the foundation of the world there is nothing that can happen you in your lifetime before you pass either by the grave or by Rapture there's nothing that can hinder you from your predestinated destination I'm so thankful for that and so our mission is to be consumed with having our hearts turned back to the word and it's only by Revelation can can this happen to us brother brandom says he says uh we have other things that we think of that are more important my brother and my sister the most important thing in your life is I wonder if somebody just asked you what is the most important thing in your life now most of you probably know what I'm going to say because you know the message but brother brandom said the most important thing in your life is to entertain Jesus Christen right not entertain your flesh not ABC NBC CBS not the movies not Sports not business not politics none of those things your most important thing is to entertain Jesus Christ and you entertain Jesus Christ by living a life a Life of Christ a life that is dedicated a life that is Sanctified a life that is committed to to showing how much God means to you we only get one chance to prove to God how much we love him and sad to say many times it's when people have fallen into ill health and and their health is declining and they don't have strength they don't have energy they don't have the stamina but now that they're in that that condition they look back through the tunnel of time and they see what they could have done they see what they should have done one of one of the two things I was speaking about we had young people in our congregation who had a burden for the word some of these children are as young as 12 and 13 and 14 years old and their burden was to make sure that every message that brother brandom ever spoke was transcribed and put into a format in other words they had to retype all the messages in a electronic format that can be put up onto the message Hub and right now they have done over 700 messages there were 400 of them that were already done but over 700 messages and right now every single message that brother brandham ever spoke is available for somebody that can go into the message Hub and they can download it right to their computer and and the second thing the second thing is for the last two weeks we have had our young people they finished that project and they wanted another project so one of our brothers he got inspired he said let's go out and do some Street witnessing the first week they had 10 and they had people in church on Sunday Saturday we just got the word on on Sunday Saturday there was 40 of our young people and some of our Elder some of our senior citizens were out there with them passing out tracks what a spectacle they were on the streets of Vancouver with their long dresses and their long hair with the glory of God on their face passing out messages shaking people's hands God bless you on I am sure that that that Jesus Christ was entertained when he saw that taking place in their lives you believe that amen I believe the most important thing in any life is to entertain Jesus properly in first place in your worship first place in your life first place in Everything Jesus Christ deserves that place amen I believe it in my heart but if you don't he'll take second place yeah he'll go down in the basement with you if you're ashamed of him when you're out among the people and then you go down in the basement where nobody will see you he'll still come to you that ought to make you love him above everything else in the worlden Jesus in second place Jesus in fourth place Jesus in 10th place but still he comes to you that's in the unwelcome Christ brother Brandon spoke that little message in Luzon Switzerland my eye was gripped when I read that entertain we have the privilege of entertaining the Lord Of Glory and so now when God comes and he revealed to us he revealed to us what happened how Satan deceived those angels and then they were cast out of of of that compartment and they set up in another place and then God knew there had to be a battle there had to be a place where the battle between right and wrong wrong good and evil would be fought and it was known of God that that place was going to be the mind of man every person on earth is fighting a battle in their mind right amen that's right some people are fighting a battle that they can never win right they wake up in the morning defeated they go through their life defeated and they they go to sleep defeated and they will go to their grave defeated many of them will never have the opportunity one time to hear the words that you and I hear right we should never ever ever let this become common or taking it for granted in fact one place brother brandom asked a question and again smoke my heart he said I wonder are you sufficiently impressed yeah with what God has done and the word that is among you are you sufficiently impressed do you hold the word in high esteem do you hold the message in high esteem do you do you consider that we are the Elite of God by the grace of God that he considered us he chose us he elected us he called us he chose us and by this word we should become electrified illuminated supercharged quickened we should be ready willing and able to go out and fight the good fight of Faith all the time this message is revolutionary and it's evolution AR the message continues to evolve in a higher plane as you understand you know many people they will be hindered in their relationship that they can have with the Lord Jesus Christ because of their lack of Revelation and a lack of Revelation become comes because of a lack of Consecration and a lack of dedication it takes a commitment and a commitment is when you eliminate your track doors a commitment is when you go and you say Lord I'm going to serve you Lord me and you are a majority so God has introduced us to a supernatural civilization he gave us the understanding and the revelation of what took place between the serpent and between Eve and that Cain and Abel were twins my what a great and glorious understanding I I I know people who have the whole Bible memorized one brother UPC he witnessed to me about the oness of God had the baptism of Jesus name I went looking for him because I heard his tapes I had never heard any man preach like that in my life he preached about one God he preached about baptism in Jesus name he preached Holiness to a height that I had never heard before something it seemed to me like it was unattainable and I hunted this man down and found out where he was going to be and I went to a meeting and he spent the whole week with me and showed me the error of the trinity revealed to me the truth about godhead and baptism told me the whole story of how Pentecost and the Assembly of God had had not been able to embrace the Oneness of the godhead and baptism in jesus' name and how they had separated and then over the years how the Assembly of God and all the other nazarin and the Church of God their standard kept getting lower and lower and lower till now they're just like the world and I walked into a church and it seemed like I had been into a Time Warp I I looked at seen people it looked like they were like 40 or 50 years behind the times there was not one there was not one trace of paint on any of the faces all had long hair all had long dresses uh believe me I was stunned beyond my ability to express myself but it was a holy awe I said this is the way that Christians should be glory and so I spent some time in that church and this man who introduced me to the UPC took him six years he had the whole Bible memorized but when somebody witnessed to me about the message and God shown that light that Supernatural light of Revelation that communication system began to ring true that that IR THM inside of my soul it begin to ring that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth now who did I want to go back to First the brother who had rescued me from the Trinity I wanted to go back to yeah and I said Brother Bear I said I have met I have met a man and uh you know I I told you the testimony this is the only church I've ever given that testimony in but I am I am absolutely stunned at how far that test I cannot go anywhere and I talk to people all over the world and that testimony has found its way into countries all over the world I don't know how it did it but they said brother did that really happen that really that guy really do that did he really he really get on the bus left you in his car he really did that to the preacher yeah he sure did well that was the preacher that I went back to and tried to preach the message to I said have you heard of this man William brandom a brother brandham the first words out of this man's mouth who has the whole Bible memorized 16 years the first word oh boy brother Ernie watch that serpent seed don't let it get you yeah now can you IM how can a how can a man understand the Bible If he if he's lost in Genesis 3 it doesn't matter what happens in Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy it doesn't matter what happens all the way through there he's lost he doesn't understand what God has done he doesn't understand why it was blood he doesn't understand where sin came from he doesn't understand where that nature came from he doesn't understand that Satan has his church and Satan always wanted worship and he still wants worship he doesn't care how he gets it if he gets it by deceit if he gets it by default he will take that worship and he has got billions worshiping him amen through through through uh fragmentation of Christian denominations of Buddhists of Hindus of Muslims siks James every kind Voodoo witchcraft whatever it is every one of them is worshiping Satan right amen but you know hmon he hated Mori oh my did he hate Mori everyone in town when they saw when they saw hmon come they said oh Bow Down The Great hmon is amongst us but Mori the Jew just sat there amen that's right and looked at him and he went and told his wife he said he said the King has given me honor the King has given me Glory he's put me on a head of all the men but all these things they don't do me one good as long as that Mori the Jew won't bow down to me and you know what Satan feels the same way about you he said that dick he won't bow down before me Sam he won't bow he doesn't call you brother he just calls you Sam right that dirty steak or Sam won't bow down before me Dale way won't bow down before me right and it bothers Satan we're the only ones who have got his number the only one who understand the whole economy of God we understand we look back in typ and brother Brandon he points us to Enoch he said Enoch walked with God and was not that's you you are the Enoch of this generation each one of us collectively we are the Enoch generation you are the Abraham and Sarah of this generation you're the ones who are going to be changed back to young again you're going to have a body change you you are you are the the Rebecca of this day you're the one that watered the camel TR you're the one that had the Revelation when eler when eler came and and he prayed and Rebecca walked right into his prayer that was a big job people don't realize what a big job that was just to water one camel was a big job and they didn't have running water they had water and they ran to get more water and they ran back with the water that was their running water and she said I'll Water all your camels for you I'll give you a drink and take care of all your camels and then he knew that was the right one and then he went back to meet her family Glory right and brother Brandon says when when when when Ela met Rebecca's family he said he never had any problem with her father but it was her mother and her brother that wanted to stop the progress oh you know wait for a little while you know but but but elzer he was possessed he had to get Rebecca back to Isaac that was all he cared about and you know after you hear about eler all you hear about after that is Isaac and Rebecca amen and so brother brandham says now he said the the father he said he didn't have any problem with him but the mother and the brother and he said the mother is a type right of the mother church right right that wants to pour cold water on one of her children if she gets a a dose of the Holy Ghost the real Holy Ghost and the brother he's type of the brother preacher right and somebody gets excited goes running back to him tells him about serpen SE godhead baptism Prophet right away brother preacher and mother Church they're going to pour water when we have mystery Expos that's the last thing I do I don't like to beg but I beg these men who have come to the mystery Expo I said we're going to give you as the Eagles to Earth The Nest we're going to give you a church age book we're going to give you a a man sent from God we're going to give you uh uh these books and we want you to read these books we don't give them 70 weeks of Daniel or Seal's book until they read these these three books first and we beg them take these books and and come back to the follow-up seminars that they have every week I says and and and don't go to Mother Church don't go to brother preacher you just make a commitment between you and God say father I'm coming to you I'm coming to you and if this message that I have heard and and they're all inspired when they come because we preach about 30 min sermons to them of inspiration and Revelation that brother Brandon brought out of the Bible that they never saw before and they said where is this all coming from they've been preaching for many years and they've never seen they've never seen the three stages of the Rich Young Ruler they' never seen the wise and the foolish virgin they never seen that King Saul was saved all these things that brother Brandon brought to light right and and and and it quickens them it quickens a spark inside of them but if they run back and run back to their local churches or local PE preachers or pastors or friends that they've got confidence in it's it's it's a sure sign that they're going to have a hard trial very very difficult time right and so Isaac and Rebecca you you are the Rebecca of this age and and and and all as you need is Isaac that's all you you need you and Isaac married and you have been married if you are part of the Bride of Jesus Christ at some time in your life Jesus Christ has come and he has proposed to you supernaturally he has said will you become my bride will you become Mrs Jesus Christ will you accept the wedding band of unmar Grace and if you say I do it changes you forever it changes your goal it changes your focus it changes your priority it gives you that mandate a holy Supernatural mandate that I am going to walk arm in arm with my husband even though I can't see him I know he's here I know he's with me I know he's in me I know he has consumed and possessed and absorbed me with his character with his life with his purpose and then we look at Jacob Jacob is our type every one of us was a Jacob every one of us had that Jacob nature had that Jacob spirit and every one of us we had to wrestle with the angel of the Lord and and and and Jacob wrestled all night long and even at the end of it when the angel said light is coming let me go and and Jacob said I'm not letting you go until you bless me he was still a dealmaker he was not I didn't fight all night long to walk away from this with nothing I want something I want a blessing and the angel touched him and from that time forward that Shyer that little con man that little Wall Street kind of a Jew he W the angel touched him on his thigh and it shrank and from that time on he walked different he he halted on his hip like that all the time and the people who knew him said you see that guy over there he said he said he said that used to be Jacob he used to be a bad guy he used to be a con man used to be used to be somebody that skin your Li you never want to do any business with him but he he wrestled with the angel of the Lord and now he walks different and he talks different and he lives different and when you have that experience every one of us has had to have that Common Thread that common experience we all Wrestle with the angel of the Lord and we can come to a rest where brother brandom had a woman standing there he said now Sister you don't know me I don't know you but there is one here who does know you and does know me he said now when he and his Spirit comes in me and my spirit goes away right and he gives me a temporary Resurrection in my spirit right and he wants to use my body and I'm so happy to loan it to him anything he can get out of it now when a person can come and understand that that when the prophet was under the anointed and the Word was flowing out of him or when he was in a healing line or a discernment line there was nothing that could stand between him and the people they were totally transparent before him because it was God who knew that person God knew everything they ever did do he knew everything they ever will do he knew every problem they had right amen and often times it wasn't them who had a problem it was a brother who had a sister it was somebody who was in a mental instit stitution it was somebody had already had numerous operations and he told them about them and and and and one one of our brothers at the church he went through all the discernment line and he put them all on on eight cassette tapes that have now been put on to a disc and then he went and he and and he gleaned a little bit deeper and and he put the query in there and your name is and he went every time where brother Brandon was in a discernment line and he called the person out and said and your name is he took all of those and he put them onto a disc oh my it is so awesome just to sit there just to lay in bed at night time and just hear that prophet of God and you just know it's God it's God and it just takes your faith and it raises your faith up to a new level many people over the years they have been healed by the very by the very the very ailments that brother Brandon was talking about that somebody else had right because they said if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever there's no reason why if he healed them that he can't heal me we can go a long time in the Joseph what a perfect type of Christ Joseph was he was loved of his father he was hated of his Brethren sold into slavery and then and then he was he was elevated to Piper's house accused unjustly went into jail went into prison but he had a dream and the butler was saved and the baker was lost and he was raised up to the right hand of pharaoh Jesus loved of his father hated of his Brethren accused unjustly thrown into prison and and and then elevated to the right hand right hand of God while Joseph was was there while Joseph was at the right hand of pharaoh he took a gentile bride while Jesus was there he has taken himself a gentile bride and we are that bride I was in Israel with a group of of people uh they loved Israel and we had three Jewish gods on the bus I was there with another brother and each one you know got up and said something about their experience in Israel and I just said have you ever considered the parallels the perfect parallels between Jesus and Joseph and I just gave them exactly the way that brother Brenham laid it out and and and the denomination brother they was sitting there oh that's wonderful brother and the Jews were sitting there I never heard that before yeah I got to study that I got to go back to my Rabbi on that one yeah they didn't know about that the beautiful story of Ruth and Boaz you are Ruth friends know when you consider when you consider her desperation she was a moabitas her her family descended from incest from incest and they were hated by the Jews and yet and and yet they got married into a Jewish Family and you know and and and and and uh uh Naomi never should have left the Homeland because Boaz was her near Kinsman he never participated in the in the famine but IMC and Naomi went out and they took themselves for their sons to Moab his wife and the father died the two sons died and then Naomi left in poverty she's got these two moabites she tells them go back to your people I'm going back to go on the welfare program yeah and orer said well Naomi we sure love you but see you later she's gone right but Ruth said don't don't don't say it don't tell me to go wherever you go I'm going your God is my God your people are my people wherever you go that's where I'm going and she came back think about it Naomi I mean you know in in shame humility ation she comes back broke bankrupt she comes back and she's got this moabi that she's carrying with her y y and the moabites she goes out and she shows the character she had seen God and her mother-in-law and she went out there gleaning doing that backbreaking work in the Harvest Sun where the the Harvesters had to leave the edges for the poor people and they had to get down on their knees and they had to go and reach over get little barley here little barley here and while she's doing that the men the men the chief the Chiefs are are watching her watching her character and then Boaz comes riding on on his Chariot and he says who's the Gentile and they say oh that that that's Ruth he said that's that's your near Kinsman remember ALC and Naomi or Al lic's dead his son's dead Naomi's come home she's broke but she's got this daughter and this daughter has worked tirelessly just resting just a little bit Boaz got the Revelation he said bring bring that girl here he said Ruth don't go to any more of these denominational tables you stay right here and he told the men don't you let anything happen to her because it was dangerous for a moabit to be there you because they were hated among the Jewish man it was dangerous for her to be there don't you let anything happen to her and wherever you see her gleaning you go ahead of her and you make sure there's plenty of barley easily accessible to her and so she started picking up the godhead and the baptism serpent I'm talking about our day that's how God has given us handfuls handfuls on purpose he's laid it right out before us and some of us we don't have the passion to eat it to gather it to collect it to metabolize it to internalize it and to manifest it right amen oh my what a what a day you know brother brandom says he says uh don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time I am saved I have God in my heart I believe with all my heart you believe in Divine Healing with all my heart let your testimony always and your thoughts ever never permit a negative thought to come into your mind if you can help a Christian is always positive never negative a a a Believer is a seeker of Supernatural intelligence and intelligence that the FBI and the CIA and the TSA the TSA those are the guys at the airport you know what you know what TSA stands for thousands standing around that's what they are we've got a little airport in my city and a lot of times there's more TSA agents there than there are customers there and they're looking for somebody to torment looking for somebody to search looking for somebody to make a hard day I feel sorry for some of our senior citizens who go there they don't give them a place to sit down to take their shoes off and and and you know and sometimes they got you know they got artificial hips and artificial knees and ankles and all kind of things and boy when that when that Bell goes off when that buzzer goes off they think they got somebody I got a potential terrorist come over here and they get the wand out there up your hand put your hands up like that how many of you ever thought you'd ever be subjected to anything like that and now they got they got things that are even taking away your privacy right it's horrible the way it's going and so we have revelation we have the apocalypse we have the unveiling of God in this day right you know all hell is against the revelation of this message but it's the truth anyways we all have to go like brother brandham said we all have to go through the Hall of critics and shame before we go to the Hall of Fame as a masterpiece we are acting out a supernatural drama every day in in in our lives you know when I was I was coming back from a a trip one day just closing right now I know it's a Wednesday night and many of you have to drive and work tomorrow but I was coming back from a trip and uh I I just started writing on a on a pad and I just started thinking of all the Magnificent Revelations and understandings and illuminations that God has given to me and I just started writing them down if a prophet had not come and with this I close if a prophet had not come how would you and I have ever known that Noah preached for 120 years and that it never rained one time right nobody knows that outside of the message it took after the fact Revelation you know a prophet is like a submarine that submarine has got a periscope well a prophet he's like a prophet scope and when God wants to lift him up and God wants to turn him back and take him back 6,000 years and tell us what Eve looked like the most beautiful woman in the world tell us what the serpant look like great big prehistoric giant you know this is a privilege that God gives to us to illuminate our minds to understand who we are and what God is and where we're going how could you have ever known that Abraham and Sarah were going to be changed back to a young man and a young woman again but when you see it it's right there in the Bible when we do the mystery Expo they say oh I never saw that before wow that's a good one y and they think they got one little truth but then they start coming coming coming coming you know how would you know that King Saul was saved if there was one guy in the Bible I never thought I'd going to see in heaven it was King Saul he disobeyed God he tried to kill David over and over and over and over he went to the witch of Endor which he himself said was a crime worthy of death called up Samuel Samuel said why have you called me from see you become the enemy of God that's right Saul says the spirit of God has left me yeah you a prophet says you're the enemy of God Saul says the spirit of God's left me and Samuel and he says I want to know what's going to happen in the battle he said you and your sons will fall in battle and tomorrow you will be with me prophet of God said don't you put Saul in hell he was backsliding but don't you put him in Hell amen wow Glory what a truth how would you have known the Rich Young ruler's ultimate end was hell and the three stages that he went through before he got there how would you have known that hell was not Eternal right how could we have ever known the truth about baptism and godhead the truth about the Rapture and the changing how it's going to take place how would we know who the two witnesses were and the 144,000 and the souls under the altar my when these things started to come come open up to me it was like it was like a panorama it was like the best it was like the best movie I ever saw in my life and I was seeing it in the womb of my mind God was prating my mind with Seven Seals he was literally unsealing himself Night by Night himself not brother brandham brother brandham didn't reveal the Seven Seals it was Jesus Christ who revealed himself to the prophet of God through the office of that Prophet how can we have known the Seven Seals the serpent seed the how we measure the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom the Antichrist was already working in Paul's day the world's looking for the anti Christ and the false prophet and the Beast we know they're all one and the same just three stages like God had three stages father son Holy Ghost same thing with the devil how could we have known who the the the great and the Harlot and the number the mark the image the name of the Beast the seven dimensions how could we have known that two little Horn of Revelation 13 was the USA who brought fire from heaven with a nuclear bomb brother BR that was America y how could we have ever known the truth about 666 you know that one really rattles people especially in the Philippines because the Philippines is so Catholic and many of these preachers we're preaching to have come out of Catholicism and they still have family and Catholicism and it ignites them when they find out that their PE that they just thought they had come out of Catholicism to something better but they had no idea now their family is trapped in the Beast system how could we have ever known the truth because there great conflict sometimes even within the Ws of the message about the tribulation period is it 3 and A2 years is it seven years how could we have known about adoption and predestination statute of a perfect man truth about marriage and divorce the anointed ones at the end times Satan zeden God of this evil age Jezebel religion doing God a servant without it being his will how could we have understand how God moves supernaturally in the life of a people and how could we have ever understood or even known about the third pull all these wonderful things you know brother Brandon just in closing this brother brandom says you know there there was there was a great controversy about the Seven Seals yeah and I have my own opinion brother brandom said the Seven Seals is not open y to the public but it is open right to the private right Guardianship and the Bride of Jesus Christ it is open to us and I think it's the most wonderful thing that God could ever do is to unveil himself to give us rapturing Faith that's right exactly brother random says a rejected King let's stand to her feet he said a rejected King he says oh my precious friend my beloved my darlings of the Gospel my begotten children of God listen to me your pastor I I wish there was some way I could explain it to you but there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing that you ever there is no way to explain it there's no way I just can't do it but whatever you do and this is a thought that I would like to leave this to you with with with with a love that is pulsating in my heart to you my brothers my sisters to the Bride of Jesus Christ whatever you do friends lay aside everything else till you get perfect love get to a spot that you can love everybody every enemy everything else that one visit there has made me a different man I can never never never be the same brother Brandon that I was after all the things that he saw after all the the Realms and the dimensions that God had taken him to all the things that he saw all the miraculous the hundreds of thousands in India the blind man healed the the the dead raised back to life again but but but when he went beyond the curtain of time he said I can never never never be the same brother Brandon that I was he said whatever you do friends lay aside everything right make it a priority get perfect love the message came to take the fear off the people the message came to take the complexes off the people when you get rid of your fear and you get rid of your complexes and you fall in love with Jesus Christ you fall in love with everybody else God bless you let's pray father we thank you for this time that you have allowed us to gather together on this Wednesday evening Lord I Thank you for Brother Sam and sister Peggy and their family Lord for how they have loved me treated me like one of their own father and for the church here I'll never forget the the love that that they shown to me through the years I still remember that time I was here on my birthday Lord I just deposited something in my heart a great love for these people and Lord I know that each one of us has great burdens know this year Lord great and wonderful marvelous things have taken place in my life Revelations that have come to me understanding depths of Grace and love that you continue to unveil to us and yet Lord It's a time where it's been a real hard trial even my mom now starting chemotherapy tomorrow my father stepf father losing his memory don't know what's going to happen Lord father I just pray that you would give us courage that you would that you would give us the strength you would give us an understanding that nothing can take place in this world unless it gets by you first and if you allow it to happen you've got a testimony in the making I believe for my mother I believe for my stepfather Lord I believe that you're going to move in their lives father for this service I have desired to to just convey the supernatural element and the aspect of this message that is a million mes above anything else that's on this Earth Lord the world they have TV stars movie stars sports stars rock and roll star every kind of a star and the world just throws themselves down at their talent the world throws themsel at the feet of beauty but yet Lord we desire the beauty of your Holiness it's only one thing greater than happiness and that's holiness and Lord by your by Your Word you have made us a holy people it's by your blood by your sacrifice at Calvary Lord you you you took the beating you took the bruising no man was ever marred like you were marred and while you were on that cross we are on your mind and Lord you had a plan and the plan was going to start shortly after your Resurrection father when you abducted Saul and he became Paul and you took the 120 and put them in the upper room and they came down speaking with tongues and every man heard them in their own language and they went and they turned the world upside down father and we see seven Church ages came to pass and then we saw the seventh angel that was in your hand you swed him into the world he was the one that was going to bring the culmination of all all truth to a bride that was going to emerge in the most wicked the most deceptive the most deceiving the most perverted generation that man has ever known and yet this bride was going to shine in all of your beauty father Lord I pray if there'd be one here tonight who has never surrendered thems totally to you Lord we know that time is short we know the Rapture is right around the corner yes we know the cup of iniquity is just about full be ready to overflow soon Lord we wouldn't want one to have to miss the Rapture to go in a tribulation I'd like to just ask you Lord if there's one here that you want to speak to tonight and they want to begin this great Supernatural Journey this magnif ific Obsession to know you and to manifest your life i' like to ask them Lord to respond to you not to me Lord but to you would there be one here who would say you know I'm not where I need to be if the Rapture were to take place today I don't know where I'd be tomorrow but I want to be in a Rapture is there anybody here let me say I want to for once and for all I want to surrender my life totally 100% to Jesus Christ God bless bless you God bless you brother God bless you God bless you God bless you anybody else before we pray God bless you brother yes God bless you son God bless you God bless you God bless you I tell you friends both my hands are I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed of the Gospel there's one thing every one of us has and it's a greater need for more of God we all have that need for we're all in the same boat together but that boat is anchored that boat is going to Crest every wave and we're going to arrive at a safe destination to our Eternal destination Lord father you've seen the hands that were raised tonight I pray father that you would give them the desire of their heart and as a prophet of God had said don't ask God for little things ask him for great big things ask him for Spiritual things ask him for Supernatural understanding ask him for for a personal intimate Covenant relationship with the King of Kings and the Lord of lords I pray Lord that your will will be done in their lives that if it's tonight that you're starting a work in their life or if you're starting a further work in the lives of those who have walked this path for many years I pray Lord it would be a glorious path that they would walk on and they would end on streets of gold at a wedding supper we ask all these blessings in your precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ Christ amen amen we sing a song I want to I want to to live the way he wants me to live do you know that song
