========================================

and also I'm going to pray over this little lesson before we get started Heavenly Father pray once again you just bless this here this this I teach this lesson Let It Be edifying to your people encouragement uplifting to them Lord as you know I have this lesson about love ever on My Heart Lord as I study it more and meditate it just goes deeper and deeper there's so many layers to your love Lord it just never end pray just let it be a blessing help and encouragement to your little bride here thank you for all your blessings in Jesus name amen few little testimonies here at preliminary as I flew my middle two girls yesterday down to lawrencville the airport there only one that I know of around that's got a restaurant right there at the airport you can literally taxi your plane right up to the restaurant go in there to eat we went in there and everything was fine we flew back flew up to 3500 ft altitude kind of has an effect on people in different ways I never seen this happen but Landon Ula was complaining of terrible ear painy and and the ear a you know didn't have it before went home and and Gabby checked with a little scope thing whatever you call that the doctor stick in your ear you know and she said there a little blister like a blood blister or something they prayer call on they hand his arm put her to bed you know got the thr and you perfectly fine Gabby check and there was no time ever what in thank Lord for that I call him just scone so a little testimony about IA and don't know she stayed in the hospital four days let's go along brother Bob's less than my Sunday about that third day cuz I just want to say that on the third day is when she started responding to that medicine the third day like you told about when she coming around doctor came in the BR rening from ear to air saying the medicine's working doing it thing and she can go home tomorrow so on the fourth day that's significant to you remember my original testimony about IA when she was born and nearly died at 3 days old that on that fourth day is when she started coming around no different medicine that time no different treatment at all that we know of is the Bo tou her and she started raise up on Resurrection Sunday and started to cut around and but uh she's had many hospital stays this was her fourth one that I can recall having to stay in the hospital for multiple days and she knows when the nurse or doctor comes in the room she was set as you know I'm going P no she going to be stuck you going to be pted and poked and taking the MRIs and xrays and EKGs and giving all kind of medicine she don't want to take and all this things so she get she cring it when a doctor nurse comes in she she gets on on and very out of character I was there visiting I was still working taking care of kids elsewhere but visiting every night G being I was there in the hospital Atlanta and I was just sitting there looking her she's still out of character the do the nurse giv a little like a tourniquet I think little rubber band thing she's sitting there just slapping her legs with and it's not happy at all just like she just remind me Jus body in that quarter roaches in the tle fixing chase out the money changer going to attack a nurse of this things hates being there and one day she set up in the bed and she wented over at Mom and she says uh when one of the nurses came in that didn't do any of that stuff that didn't poker just came in to talk she said I like the nurses that just come in just to talk so she hates all that stuff but by God's grace she'd have to come home and have F Well couple nights ago she wanted to give her tic Bo [Applause] so see the only kid that hadn't done that that hadn't been baptized yet and hadn't got saved and so we've been kind of talking to her along the way just waiting for the Lord to deal with her and the other night she said I want to be baptized and said do you understand what it means and so we started talking and prayed the CER prayer with her later to the Lord sit get baptized but that heart monitor I can't it's not supposed to be submerged in water so we got to wait you know y little bit longer so another little uh preliminary not this is more pertaining to my lesson and um just an encouragement that to everybody just admonishing everybody just to remind everybody to do this um I left a lot out that little testimony too about again there's the numbers and there's the names of the nurses and all that you know always look at those things that we had another Caitlyn which if you don't know the name Kate different forms of that name that we had in the first time at that the Kate the name Kate means pure I believe God works through doctors and nurses whether they believe or not I believe God and angels work through them yeah we purify amen purify people because they're dealing with mankind God's most precious creation and and helping people and trying to help people and so God works for them to purify and cleanse from disease and here we had our first nurse and there was Caitlyn once again that our first nurse practitioner what um anyway I'll leave out a lot of other details just I'm going to go on this little other preliminary this more TI into my lesson uh as brother white is our new pastor now I want to uh remind everybody to encourage him it's the hardest role of anybody on Earth that I know of even greater than the position of President of the United States nothing higher of a calling than to be a pastor in the Church of upon the Bride of Jesus Christen and so we need to stand behind him and sister June back them with all of our prayers yes all the time as you know gab and I constantly listening to the seals brother Del preach in 82 and 83 and over all the many years we've heard him say Lord bless our wife Yonder he's always saying bless our wife I thinking Brother D that's that's your wife my brother you know that's our wife and the Lord's always been attacking her and her body with sat oh because she is serving the lord because devil knows that's a weakness for a man we we want our wives and kids to be well and we hate to see them down and devil just makes a playground out of them I know sister Jan L been red with sickness and pain in her body just beyond what I can imagine but we hold them up in prayer and all the weight hold him up in prayer and encouragement and anything you can do brother bram's message on I am the resurrection and the life said now you got to have confidence in the house and judgment House of God where God comes down passes his judgment your pastor you're supposed to be a righteous man the congregation is supposed to be with him 100% you're supposed to be just the 100% together and in there if you're not they just got a way to get him you got a lul have everything cleared out in Christ my God reveal to love one another that's TI in my love lesson love one another above everything love one another don't matter what the devil tries to say you're all in one great big sweet group now remember all warnings he say mo let that stay that way he'll shoot everything he's got to bring somebody to make this Target and bring some credit for unbel in and sit him down cause him Fellowship to go under the quietness and things and then I'll shoot that guy with some kind of P how you go skipping on the yellow part and stay with your pastor he's the shepherd and he and you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained God to do so man you remember that yeah anyy come in what it does to cling that much closer together and then run that the devil's using and enemy we get out would come in and be one of you I call this Galatians 66 man to man my dad in the Baptist Church he used to write emails to the uh pastor and I I took notice of that and I thought that's a good thing to do and he try to encourage the pastor and say I like what you said here and here and here so over many years now our ministers that know that I write them letters or emails or I meant to them in the parking lot always always tried to because when I teach Sunday school people just stare at me I don't know if you're getting in saying or not I like a little word of encouragement you know come to me and get tell me what you got out of it you know and I thought how much more would the man of God standing here as a pastor actual preacher want to be encouraged and know that somebody getting what he's saying so that's why I write these email to our Minister and I call it 66 because man to man because six is number of man Galatians 66 man to man taught let him that is taught in the word Comm unicate unto him that teacheth in all good things so tell them what you got out of that sermon and encourage him in the Lord you know uh so brother John's been teaching on this financial Jubilee and I don't know if y'all recognize but he's talking about more than just finances he's talking about Jubilee from sin from the Deb of sin Jubilee from vdomus and and fear and torment and anxiety and sickness and uh lust and depression and all kind of things that tie into that lesson of Jubilee and it goes a lot deeper than just finances he ain't talking about just money and likewise my love lessons are more than just about marriage and more than just about a walk with the lord it's about both sides it's about uh there's just layers and layers and layers of this that if you will let it apply it to your life and do the little things I'm talking about simple little things it'll change a marriage I guarantee it will it's affected ours it's affected change in mind gav's marriage for sure so this lesson is is as much about marriage as it is about a relationship with the Lord I've kind of not been transparent until now saying what I really mean because um we're in a 16-year marriage and I'm talking to people who have been married longer and I've been alive so I don't really feel like I have a place to say to any of y'all how to do marriage you know but I'm just saying take it for what it's worth if it'll help you let it help if not you know keep doing what you're doing if what you're doing is working no problem but I want to be clear that aside from teaching about our love relationship Lord I'm teaching about marriage you can't tell sometimes when marriages are struggling but many are this is the remedy Christ Living in you and your spouse in your home in your marriage how by greeing listening and praying together daily to the word of God remove self from Marriage the reason I don't have a crop of corn in my yard is because I have not planted one and the reason maybe you don't have a good marriage is because you have not some to see for this takes discipline the reason you don't have a close walk with the Lord maybe you haven't done the right things that you haven't sewn the seeds for yeah gav and I both spend much time together but then separate too listening to the sermons that are preached here from our ministers I go back course we listen to him over and over again as I drive the truck at night during the day and and then Gabby stays up till about 2: in the morning almost every night she got get up at 5:00 and get kids ready for school but for certain reasons she can't wa okay um I'm going say why that is but she's up and at Night by herself cuz I'm on the road driving a truck she's there by herself listening to these ministers over and over again what we're doing is packing the word of of God down that se we want to pack down press down running over so that God can come and Quicken it because if you don't give anything to work with you can't Quicken the work to you it's not just magic it is something that you have to do on your part right seow the word of God down press it down good crop takes time and effort so does our marriage our walk Lord yes um this is from darta Bible they call it I think it's called Life Bible now that changes the name so G I read from every day and I devotion together and there's one of these little devotions in there put every day and this one was so good it ties in perfect lesson Western culture has shaped our minds to believe that the purpose of the institution of marriage is to make individuals happy people tend to believe that marriage is about finding the right person a person whose likes and dislikes hobbies and interests match our own we tend to believe it's about finding a person who completes us and makes us whole and about rights what we F this results in the me mindset in marriage we can foolishly enter into a marriage relationship focused on what we think we will get out of it in Hebrew in Ephesians 5 the Apostle Paul tells us that marriage isn't about making ourselves happy it's about making us holy marriage is a picture of how Jesus loves the church and gave himself a sacrifice Ephesians 5 marriage isn't about finding the right person it's about being the right person both husband and wife are called to be the type of people who love unconditionally forgive continually and serve sacrificially just like Jesus Paul calls us to enter into marriage with a Ministry mindset marriage isn't about what you can get out of the relationship but about what you can give to the relationship for God's glory when you seek to demonstrate love in your marriage when you are willing to lay down your life for your spouse and serve her sacrificially the gospel is rehearsed daily in your household bottom line marriage is about having the ministry mindset of loving service rather than selfish mindset it's from moment of strength that's a book that from part meate but um this is a quote from a book called strength inspiration for for men so Christ in marriage beyond the wedding day so when people come to the altar they get married and all this there's all this sanctimony ceremony there's there's preacher at the altar in the church with Witnesses in the Bible and all this stuff and then they come down and they say Lord we want you in our marriage and that's kind of in a way of committing their life and dedicating their marriage to God but what really matters is what they do in the go out there after the wedding date that's where Christ comes into marriage if you put him in your marriage you have put it in there there's something you have to do it doesn't just happen because you got married at an altar High preacher like salvation you come to the altar cry pray repent and then go out there what what matters is what happens out there if you read your Bible and pray every day that's what makes Christ in your life coming down the altar to start your marriage here is good it's a good start but beyond the wedding day is what really matters putting Christ in your marriage every seing day walk close with the Lord individually and let your spouse keep it FR is the same goes never lose your first love I'm going to talk in this lesson the title of this lesson is First Love Never Lose Your F your first love for Christ or your spouse the Ohio group and the Honduras group have Pro have provoked us to Godly jealousy by their enthusiasm about the word of God this should stimulate us and cause us to better appreciate the ministry we have be fervent don't take for granted the ministry and message we have remember that we had remov self from Marriage there should not be one mention of divorce or separation and message marriages we should be experts at love I don't claim to be an expert but I study it a lot and that's I meditate on a lot good oldfashioned thinking goes a long way you know God gave us a mind to think we can use it for him use it for the devil if we just meditate on the word of God and meditate and say Lord really what direction we have going life you don't know how much I fasted and prayed and sought God for a wife and how much I just thought about it what would make me a good life and I would just sit down and think well I want somebody Holy Ghost bu I want somebody read the B and pray with me I want somebody come to church with me and just believe the word of God with me and that's where we had the whole time and we read the Bible every day before we got engaged you know together that's important it is so key and yet we had troubles okay early on in our marriage not talking divorce but Gabby a time or two wanted to leave me for my bad attitude in Jordan Kentucky take a break for a little while and get away from for a little while and said than we got to do something to the sunmate right and it was in 2018 oddly enough through death in the family came this Revelation that my mother and all passed away and my father andlaw said to me R Sharon passed away I want you to know this we had the type of relationship that we always looking out for each other we weren't in it for own s he said um he he said I would sneak around behind her back get her a certain a new Fone or something she wanted that she wouldn't bu for herself he said she'd go around behind my back and give me that fishing pole that I wouldn't buy for myself and I thought wow I've been looking that marriage all time and that was an eye opener that simple little Revelation from there spawned all this great big uh Revelation to me that she been unfolding that selflessness is so key in marriage and not thinking of yourself where was there any grounds for argument for problems if all you're thinking about is the other person you know if all you're thinking about is how you can please him please or her please your spouse where's the rounds for argument you you know our kids almost never see any time arguments and it's just well we we fuss at the kids a lot and all that on shouting going on to the kids up between me happy no I just I love her to death and I you know she'll P up my wrongs and I said well you're right you're ex right to quit making so many sweets I'm going to make it all you know sick sugar anyway but 1 Corinthians 7 I would have you and without carefulness he that is unmarried car for the things that belong to the Lord how he made please the Lord but he that is married care for the things that are of the world how may please his wife so if you abstain from marriage in the first place you know you can commen the Lord saying but if you're in a marriage you are supposed to he's not saying anything wrong with a man caring for his wife and trying to please her and do to her he didn't sayth wrong to do that it said it's is going to be a distraction from the Lord but if you better the marry than div Bine you know he said that in another place same thing there's differ between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman care for the things that the Lord has name be holy both in body and spirit but that is married car say of the world how do she make please your husband nothing wrong with it he didn't say anything wrong it's just going to be a distraction from the Lord but you know you keep committing your life to God but try to please your husband and your wife do things for them not for your own self not what marriage is about I speak for your own Prophet not that I may cast a snare upon you for that which is comely that you may tend theart of the Lord without distraction and me read some my notes Here make sure I'm not leaving something out and his hand so God keeps his word brother G says children them back to your God quickly don't tangle with the world for anything stay out of this modern world out of these modern theologies just look at the L of God read your bow and pray all the time he didn't say just read your M and pray there's some places where he did say you go close to Lord read B and pray but there one place where he said do it every day there's one place here where he says all the time don't be worried Rejoice be rejoicing and happy for the Redemption of the church is drawing and die we shall see him who died for us you remember uh brother Bob I'm sorry brother Zach black um brother Brandon talking about at some place he's talking about in one message he talked about drinking more than your portion you know drink and push out and we have to drink enough to sustain our spiritual life drink enough at the word of God but then drink more than enough to let us bear fruit and drink more than enough to let it you know be a blessing to others around us so just keep drinking and drinking drinking and you know say like brother Zack Black's dream after getting born again getting the new first the come very and testified of a dream that he had where he was eating he end up down he was not getting full and he kept eating he still not getting full so he just kept eating and I believe the point of the dream was after get born again you're baby in Christ you need to eat well really when you're when ears in in the way of you sering the Lord you still need to eat keep keep eating and pushing out I talk a lot about studying seeking God drinking the word of God but it's is it possible to drink too much if it is let's say we don't fall in that category so let's don't worry about it and most of us I could say we need to clean more or eat more or the word of God don't worry about doing too much I think we're away away from that it's kind of like the fish in the ocean we worried about drinking too much perhaps we might think it best not to study too much we need to drink more than our portion in other words enough to satisfy us and sustain our life to be over flowing and bear fruit to God establish your first love with the Lord and maintain your first love with the Lord so we come here you know everybody likes to teach the doctrine and some people say we came with a little seed in us um and that kind of thing and and I um brother BR said a nonseed there's nothing to Quicken U by our natural birth we born of sin shaking iniquity we came with that nonseed and we came with lots of false ideas and it's is what we came there with and by the new birth we receive the word of God eternal life and we start on this ver First Love um we start on this first love with the Lord if you remember when you first gave out Lord how you were so on fire and how you just loved fell in love Lord I remember back still in the Baptist Church when I first gave my heart Lord and I was listening to worship s like I still did now and felt such a strong love for the Lord and I still do and that will still stay fresh as long as you keep reading the word of God and keep praying never let that die and same thing in your marriage and I fell in love with Gabi I felt this strong affection for her but now it's infinitely stronger than that only because I kept uh stating this room I won't get to it this room of in one of these devotion labing less and I quote this uh staying in the devotional this uh uh appreciation rooms what would you call it the room of appreciation where you don't think about all the bad things of your spouse think about all the good things and think about all the good things of God there is nothing bad about God to think about really um from Gabby and I read also Spurgeon every day on crucifies you know we read a lot of other devotions and up from other people that are not message fol a lot of blessing to be had in that and readings from Brother Charles Spurgeon we have volumes of books of his from my grandma when she passed she left theic books this is from his sermon declension from First Love assment delivered on Sabbath eil September 26 1858 Charles Bon at the new Park Street Chapel he quotes uh Revelation 2 nevertheless I was somewhat against because thou has left thy First Love uh he said if we down at the yellow I me just read the whole thing we shall never love Christ much except we live near to him love to Christ is dependent on our nearest to him just like planets in the sun why are some planets cold why did they move so slow at a slow rate simply because they're so far from the sign but the mother planet Mercury is and they should be in a boiling heat and spin around the Sun in Rapid orance so beloved if we live near to Christ we cannot help loving him the heart that is near Jesus must be full of his love but when we live days and weeks and months without personal prayer without real Fellowship how can we maintain love toward a stranger he must be a friend and we must stick close to him as he sticks close to us close to than a brother or else we shall never have our first love there's a thousand reasons why I might give but I live I leave each of you to search your heart to find out why thou H has lost each of you your first love really fall in love with the Lord first brother from toov number three um says that's why the way it is with God we're not trying to study from some newspaper 10 some the but fall in love with h get down and really get him in your heart the L of God should brought in Your Heart by the Holy Ghost then go to read the Bible and you'll see it coming right out between the lines so you know what he's saying he he never said that right out in the word Jesus thank the father because he had he had those things eyes are wise and pry no else could read my wife's letters like that because I love her the way that way and that's the way she writes to me say that's the way God writes to you it's between the lines you can have that first love always if you do what I'm talking about read the B pray every day and spend every moment you can with the Lord of God you don't have to let it diminish uh thought musicians come I'll try to read maybe one more quote here miss mus going come listen first you you got to be born again in the spirit of God and then if you're not you'll never understand the word of God God has said so God said I have hid this Bible from the wise and pretty and will Reve the bab to being if you want anything from God TF open the B fall J never get to the one where well I'm 25 years actually believer I've been Christians for 30 40 years I I understand the word I've B some many kind you know and no you never re into the ter there are some BS Christ I think I read eight I in the back more all the time it say word with being
