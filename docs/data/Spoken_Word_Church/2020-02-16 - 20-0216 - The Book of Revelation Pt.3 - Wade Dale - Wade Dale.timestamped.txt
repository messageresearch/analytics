[0:26] gonna be be kind of scrunched and that's
[0:31] okay Danny I wish you save that seat so
[0:37] much yeah I need to that's not okay
[0:41] anyway we'll find Z bars all right we're
[0:44] in the random Book of Revelations we
[0:49] went through the first chapter and what
[0:52] we're going to do is I want you to read
[0:55] the trkage book each individual one I
[0:57] mean at the individual sermons not to
[1:00] Facebook the surveys series alright and
[1:04] then what we're going to do is I'm not
[1:06] going to spend a lot of time with each
[1:08] one as far as the characteristics we're
[1:10] going to look at what the scripture says
[1:11] but then we're going to back up and go
[1:14] through like brother Branham did I mean
[1:15] really we just need to highlight brother
[1:17] I'm covered every Church age thoroughly
[1:20] how he came up with the dates how he
[1:22] came up with the ministers of that time
[1:24] and and we will spend time doing that I
[1:29] want to get on over into the book of
[1:31] Revelation because the church ages even
[1:36] y'all that came out of that Sunday
[1:37] School class y'all just came don't you
[1:39] don't go to church agents in there
[1:40] weren't you yeah so be fresh in your
[1:44] mind and I love the research AIDS book
[1:47] and I know y'all have to read it too but
[1:50] make sure you listen to the read the
[1:53] individual sermons okay so let's start
[1:57] with verse 18 I am he that liveth and
[1:59] was dead and behold I am Alive for
[2:01] evermore amen and have the keys of hell
[2:03] and death Rock these things down this
[2:06] scene so what was John commissioned to
[2:09] do John was commissioned to write what
[2:11] he see when he was
[2:13] seeing okay there's only one time he can
[2:17] try what do you see it
[2:18] and that's special for me and you in the
[2:21] end time okay dub I got help
[2:22] we'll get that Revelations 10 write the
[2:26] things which thou has seen and the
[2:28] things which are and the things which
[2:29] shall be Hereafter
[2:31] the mystery of the Seven Stars which
[2:34] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[2:36] Seven golden candlesticks these seven
[2:39] stars are the angels our messengers so
[2:42] there are seven different specific hey
[2:46] baby like a little ninja seven different
[2:51] distinct and individual messengers to
[2:55] each age we didn't know them until a
[2:58] prophet of God came in the end time and
[3:00] trouble to teach one I was named because
[3:02] like I said before I don't think Paul I
[3:04] knew you know Paul probably knew he was
[3:07] the beginning of something but that he
[3:10] was the ephesian church age messenger I
[3:12] doubt he knew that Iranians none of
[3:15] these new because remember even Luke and
[3:18] Wesley they passed away before it was
[3:21] denominated but they knew that there was
[3:23] a great where I going home but now we
[3:25] still got Lutheranism and this morning I
[3:28] was privileged that he could have
[3:30] Methodist Church and the Brotherhood so
[3:32] on John Wesley and the founder of their
[3:35] of their faith and each one has a
[3:39] different time but I'm telling you even
[3:42] as we're talking upstairs and we'll talk
[3:44] about this afternoon finish up on
[3:46] revival Paul didn't begin to revive in
[3:49] Ephesians urging the people be one man
[3:55] has never started now there's a man that
[3:58] has spearheaded but not started remember
[4:01] in a revival it started Luther's revival
[4:06] began when the people got enough of the
[4:09] Catholic Church and then God anointed
[4:12] Martin Luther to preach a message and
[4:14] then the people come out right same
[4:16] thing will mean you same thing with
[4:19] what's got to happen today you and I
[4:20] have to
[4:21] all mortal revival and not one man's
[4:25] gonna spearheaded right
[4:27] no no that's over that's over brother
[4:31] round spearheading the healing revival
[4:34] right but it was because I told you
[4:38] before he proved that God set a healing
[4:43] ministry during the early part of the
[4:46] 1900s because the medicine wasn't
[4:49] keeping up with the sickness nobody got
[4:51] that mm-hmm yes so the call for the
[4:54] people was God we don't have everything
[4:57] we don't have a hospital so on every
[4:59] corner that treats every little illness
[5:01] back in the nightmare hundreds in the
[5:03] early 1800 so the people cried out for a
[5:06] heating minister the people cried out
[5:08] for God to heal them right so God send
[5:12] somebody to spearhead that and we know
[5:16] that brother um did that but then he
[5:17] also brought his message that's for the
[5:19] people that's where people don't give
[5:21] him credit with continuing on with a
[5:23] revival that were under which is the
[5:25] word provider right right but the
[5:27] healing revival started because people
[5:29] were sick and they couldn't get relief
[5:32] from the doctor
[5:33] so they started crying out for - listen
[5:39] that's my brother I said the bride does
[5:40] better under persecution
[5:42] we're not persecuted today now this is
[5:47] not you might have little problems
[5:49] dynein persecution persecution is like
[5:52] this when you claim during Columbus Age
[5:54] when when they put you in prison it
[5:56] wasn't to judge you it was to kill you
[6:00] there was no judgment the judgment was
[6:03] you went into the lion's den or you went
[6:04] into the arena and you died you know
[6:06] because you were Christian so that was
[6:09] and we'll go through that with the
[6:11] characteristics of each church aid so he
[6:13] gives us seven different men mm-hmm and
[6:18] he gives us seven count sticks because
[6:20] look and don't get me wrong you're the
[6:24] same bedding separate he has the stars
[6:26] in his hand and then he's got this but
[6:30] now it's not the Holy Ghost in that one
[6:33] person makes the Holy Ghost into people
[6:36] crying out for someone ending God
[6:39] anoints a spearhead or annoyance the
[6:42] seven men to bring the message well who
[6:45] carries on the message listen brother
[6:46] I've been dead for 60 years 55 years see
[6:50] 12 years some like that 1965 minutes
[6:53] even day a long time 55 years but his
[6:58] message is stronger now than it was then
[6:59] there was no message churches everywhere
[7:01] when he was here right what they are now
[7:03] so who's caring they don't the people
[7:05] the voice because remember the Bible
[7:09] says revelations 10 in the days of the
[7:10] voice of the seventh angel but you've
[7:12] got to declare that in the days of the
[7:14] voice of the first messenger but now you
[7:17] got to remember revelation 10 seven
[7:19] different because it says the mystery
[7:20] one ministry we're going to be finished
[7:22] Paul didn't finish a mystery Irina's
[7:26] didn't finish a mystery they finished a
[7:28] mystery for their age but not a final
[7:31] mission on a final mystery there were
[7:34] many mysteries and remember down in this
[7:36] middle church age we'll read it
[7:38] you got a name but you're dead and all
[7:41] these different things but you know what
[7:42] God just kept on moving what through the
[7:44] people Columba died before his church
[7:46] age even started so it had to be the
[7:49] people that took the message and went
[7:50] into that church age with that message
[7:52] so it's always going to be the people it
[7:56] wasn't one man message at one time it's
[7:57] not anymore it's a mini membered body of
[8:00] Jesus Christ all one-man ministries are
[8:03] gone serve their purpose but it's the
[8:08] voice that carried on behind it the same
[8:11] way with paul iranians martin because
[8:14] they came to remember that messenger
[8:16] comes as the nba's paul come with the
[8:18] ate into the age of pentecost to bring
[8:20] the message to ephesus brought a great
[8:22] and powerful message well I think he
[8:24] died 166 1866 somewhere in there 69-66
[8:29] Paul's dead in the for 8170 way before
[8:32] so who carries on his vessel the people
[8:37] until they don't
[8:39] yes well until until the fall in a white
[8:42] stars
[8:43] until the following the light starts
[8:45] blaster anthias saying the Jesus one
[8:49] guard
[8:49] you know the end of God or a single
[8:52] person and I rainiest here's is they're
[8:55] in the same house together and Iranians
[8:57] runs out the door and soo ain't gonna be
[8:59] in there with that guy so it's got me
[9:00] you know drop the house down on top of
[9:02] it because of its message will say that
[9:04] message came to Iranian support pure
[9:07] unadulterated word came them to Iranian
[9:10] for his age but it was for his age you
[9:14] and I yes for our age but here's where
[9:18] we're supposed to be we're supposed to
[9:20] be up here not entertaining and we're
[9:23] supposed to be up here coming out of
[9:24] Turkey but let's read them two
[9:26] characteristic you got sick
[9:28] excuse me about seven angel for seven
[9:31] messengers and seven Church ages and
[9:37] it's the oil in every Church age the
[9:40] Holy Spirit in every Church age leading
[9:44] the people through the messenger thank
[9:47] God
[9:48] excuse me God set on the earth to bring
[9:51] the message to everybody got them so you
[9:53] are a recipient of the seventh angels
[9:56] message all right but we have a second
[9:58] part of that seventh angels message
[10:00] according to the church age book you and
[10:03] I have a second part of that that we're
[10:06] supposed to fulfil the seven thunders
[10:07] we're supposed to be the voice of God in
[10:09] the age we're supposed to carry this
[10:11] thing on to the coming of the Lord not
[10:12] another church age not another messenger
[10:15] were to carry this thing home sweeping
[10:17] on brother Graham said to the coming of
[10:18] the Lord revelations 1080s eleven
[10:24] messenger left you know there's no
[10:25] messenger I've got that that's running
[10:29] the book and John is the type of look
[10:31] John is a type of every person how great
[10:36] is that he's a type of every if there's
[10:39] a million in each one of these just stay
[10:42] for a number then John time to all seven
[10:44] million bride wow what a great thing I
[10:48] slaying Commission John to write when he
[10:50] saw the things which are and the things
[10:54] which shall be Hereafter
[10:58] now see that's a great thing right there
[11:00] we got to realize in our mind the Bible
[11:04] the way you're looking at the Bible was
[11:07] not written until right in here 1500 was
[11:13] when the Bible was compiled and you're
[11:15] able to read it read 1 John 1 read what
[11:18] this was not less and it was scattered
[11:19] all through hearing different things but
[11:21] as it was put into a library by 10 Dale
[11:24] and some of the different ones in the
[11:25] 1500 then they started reading the Bible
[11:28] my point is you and I have come to a
[11:31] place we've got the full Bible we've got
[11:33] the full prophets message that reveals
[11:36] the Bible right excuse me
[11:39] and it tells us every characteristic
[11:42] every Church agents have lasted and
[11:46] every Church and messenger that's what
[11:49] God wanted to reveal but he had her a
[11:53] villain in the last decade so this is
[11:55] when we needed yes think about that mark
[12:00] mark listen Martin Luther's not
[12:01] responsible for John Wesley the doctor
[12:04] he died he can't do anything about that
[12:06] he was responsible for back here he was
[12:08] trying to see look peer word peer word
[12:11] getting a little worse get a little
[12:14] worse Brown said Dark Ages just saying
[12:16] you're a Christian put you to death
[12:18] right then Martin Luther comes out the
[12:22] people's crying out for a deliverer
[12:24] because they've been to only dark ages
[12:26] dark ages for a thousand years here come
[12:28] from Martin Luther program so it was a
[12:29] little bit of like you weren't
[12:32] responsible listen
[12:34] he went responsible for taking us back
[12:37] to Paul because he did he's still
[12:41] baptized named father-son home go he's
[12:43] still baptized night falls on home go
[12:45] early church still baptized name falls
[12:47] on going on that's not what Paul breaks
[12:51] but they weren't required to take us
[12:55] back to here Malachi 4 was required to
[13:00] take us back to the faith of the Father
[13:03] that's why it fell on brother branham to
[13:08] preach the lay the doctrine of
[13:10] trinitarianism eternal hell all the
[13:13] different things that had come into view
[13:15] that these people were not responsible
[13:17] to take us back here but now this man
[13:20] right here according to my account for
[13:22] he's to turn the heart of the father's
[13:24] to the children and the children babies
[13:27] back to the Pentecostal father's what
[13:30] word about giving them Lord Jesus Christ
[13:32] no Trinitarian doctrine they didn't have
[13:35] those things back here okay
[13:37] sure they were little sayings that went
[13:38] out but until they come up in 300 and
[13:42] 600 AD and I see you you didn't have any
[13:46] of that we'll see Luther then was
[13:48] required to bring a church out under the
[13:51] just shall live by faith
[13:52] no no means no he'll marries don't say
[13:56] this all that no works all right but by
[13:59] faith the just shall live by faith
[14:01] that's all he was required not to carry
[14:04] us back to him John Wesley because I'm
[14:05] saying telling you this when we read
[14:07] this we'll see how God said these church
[14:08] faith to that John Wesley sure he'd
[14:12] built on Luther but he didn't preach the
[14:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost like the
[14:17] Pentecostal did don't actually call me
[14:21] winners don't green tea don't drink this
[14:23] don't do this don't do that right
[14:25] and he wasn't required to take us back
[14:27] to here right right but this man in this
[14:32] church ain't here he's required
[14:34] according to Malachi 4:2 carry us all
[14:37] the way back to start down here and work
[14:40] our way up not to but look not to fall
[14:43] as they did before but to go from here
[14:49] watch go from here the cornerstone to
[14:51] the ystem
[14:53] that's the whole key right we're
[14:56] headstone people but we had to be
[14:58] brought back to here this is not the
[15:01] foundation part of the wall this is not
[15:05] the foundation part of the building but
[15:08] when he's required this this spirit is
[15:10] required to take us back to the
[15:12] foundation now we start building the
[15:14] buildings rid of all had to clean off
[15:16] the building the tenant and start on the
[15:20] foundation that was built and built this
[15:23] all the way up so that's our requirement
[15:28] why did or not we're not another J we
[15:30] can't go in another Martin Luther we
[15:31] can't going under John Wesley we can't
[15:34] go in under evening campaign that just
[15:36] gives you healed I just makes me feel
[15:39] good but that's only temporary when he
[15:42] takes us back to the faith of the
[15:43] fathers but he's took us back to word
[15:45] we're talking about power these people
[15:48] had power in the Word of God why because
[15:50] they didn't have all the screw holes
[15:51] that you and I have to deal with all
[15:54] right so let's start reading a little
[15:55] bit and read the characteristics of
[15:59] these church age like I said but I'm
[16:00] gonna stop just a minute come in but
[16:02] I'll review the church ages later on
[16:05] when we come back all right oh and next
[16:08] time your brother Joe will be doing the
[16:10] same school he'll be another Dutch Scott
[16:14] then on March the 20th I think we're
[16:16] late we're going I don't think I know
[16:18] we're going to Oklahoma for a few days
[16:20] doesn't see brother Claus until the unto
[16:24] the Angel of the Church of the Epis
[16:26] Ephesus write these things saith he that
[16:29] holdeth the seven stars in his right
[16:32] hand who walketh in the midst of the
[16:34] seven golden candlesticks Oh who's they
[16:38] God right listen guts in every Church a
[16:42] memories in the mix with his
[16:45] outstretched hands and it's just as
[16:47] powerful this way as it is this way God
[16:50] doesn't diminish power as he has his
[16:52] hands going out no no he grows more and
[16:55] more because remember our church will be
[16:58] the most powerful Church because we're
[17:00] we're heading toward a body change not
[17:03] just a resurrection who walketh in the
[17:07] midst of the seven golden candlesticks I
[17:09] know that works and remember this is
[17:11] First Church age a pure Church a one
[17:13] that giant dummy one that Paul said up
[17:17] John is writing about and then remember
[17:20] John when he gets finished on Patmos he
[17:23] goes back to a decision and he passed
[17:26] through the church until he dies but
[17:29] what does he do he carries on what Paul
[17:31] started he didn't bring a new message
[17:34] that's a problem with today everybody's
[17:37] want to bring a new message but they
[17:38] think this guy's not the one to do it
[17:40] they're trying to bring their own new
[17:41] message of something different no what
[17:43] no listen seven starts seven messengers
[17:47] they had to be seven people put on this
[17:51] earth with a characteristic to lead the
[17:53] church age I don't care who you are
[17:55] these people that deny they just brother
[17:57] Brown even they think the other person
[17:59] are they're looking for somebody else
[18:02] both Wayne got time to start looking for
[18:04] somebody
[18:04] yeah we got to start believing that it's
[18:07] already here look I got firewood they
[18:15] met to this this morning Yeah right
[18:19] they with us you know you got scared run
[18:21] out the door I know that works and thy
[18:28] labour he's telling hey I know what you
[18:30] do I know what's going on and that
[18:32] patience and how thou canst not bear
[18:36] them what you're able like serenity it's
[18:39] an Iranian of course Iran stood at the
[18:41] end of the Iranians does come at the end
[18:44] of the of the exodus church age and
[18:46] brings a message but why is he bringing
[18:48] from he brings it from Paul brings him
[18:52] back worried that later on the ballot
[18:54] right now can thou canst not bear them
[18:57] which are evil and thou has tried them
[19:00] which say they are possible dead or not
[19:02] like the different ones reading the
[19:04] Bible reading the book of Acts who was
[19:06] that there was Simon the Tanner and all
[19:08] these different ones that followed you
[19:11] know followed the message of the day who
[19:13] was the one the sorcerer he wanted to
[19:17] buy him he wanted to you know he see
[19:19] people getting the Holy Ghost and he
[19:20] says let me buy some of that Paul said
[19:24] Peter once says Simon I know what's in
[19:29] your heart come to one time simon says
[19:33] in the bible he says give can you give
[19:36] me the Holy Ghost so that I can lay my
[19:38] hands on other people they gave me but
[19:39] they knew God knew his heart that he was
[19:42] going to get the glory not God so God so
[19:46] Peter said now you're not ready for this
[19:50] in other words and if you'll notice once
[19:53] that happened you never hear that again
[19:54] it's just like period and then God
[19:56] starts with something else
[19:57] do you have always time on people that
[19:59] are wasting time now has tried then
[20:05] we'll say the apostle there or not and
[20:07] has found them liars and has borne all
[20:12] right we know what that is
[20:15] persevered and has patience and for my
[20:19] name's sake no look my name the name
[20:22] wasn't long in the first church age the
[20:24] name got lost on up here you'll see in a
[20:26] little while till they baptized right
[20:30] when brother Branham stands up and he
[20:32] says bring me in hit all of history
[20:36] before
[20:37] Nicaea which is three real three hundred
[20:41] somewhere in there 300 AD 325 thank you
[20:45] ad when they had the nice thing company
[20:48] said show me anywhere in history where
[20:50] anybody was baptizing anything other
[20:52] than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:53] or Jesus Christ that's what he's saying
[20:56] you have kept my name the name was kept
[21:00] in the first couple of church ages and
[21:02] for my name's sake hast laboured and has
[21:05] fainted nevertheless now look he's talk
[21:10] he listen
[21:11] he is not talking to the world he's
[21:15] talking to the people in the church
[21:16] right that's why I'm telling you when we
[21:21] look at the plan we call a revival
[21:23] that's what let's tell them this morning
[21:24] we are looking for some great something
[21:28] to happen when it's kind of happening
[21:30] you further it's gotta happen in the
[21:33] individual first yes because this is God
[21:37] saying to me and you nevertheless I have
[21:40] somewhat against thing now he didn't say
[21:44] that you've lost your first love right
[21:50] you can't lose your salvation you can't
[21:54] let it once you're born again you have
[21:56] the love of God in your soul can't lose
[21:57] it but you left it you've one of the
[22:01] words you've moved away from it what was
[22:04] because what remember what does the room
[22:05] I will do it revives what's inside of
[22:07] you already not something external it
[22:10] revive what's inside God's calling them
[22:13] back to not to repent one of their
[22:17] sentence repent because you are no
[22:19] better same way with all of us that's
[22:24] what we're talking about this afternoon
[22:25] listen you'll know if there's a revival
[22:27] starting life because like that black
[22:29] realized I'm sorry brother thank you
[22:32] realize that there was something off we
[22:37] was in a position that he knew that God
[22:39] was dealing with his heart right now you
[22:46] may call it salvation whatever you want
[22:47] to call it doesn't matter he realized
[22:49] something when right and when you
[22:51] realize that something's not right
[22:56] and you know as well as I do I don't go
[22:59] for laundry list but I'm telling you if
[23:01] you should still don't pay your tithe
[23:04] not in a revival you're not even
[23:06] boarding it yeah
[23:14] it's basic but if you've left you first
[23:21] love cold to miss morning won't name a
[23:24] little method this they looked at me a
[23:25] little strength I said look you should
[23:27] be reading your Bible like I said if you
[23:30] read it blue devil if you read your
[23:33] Bible thirty minutes today read in an
[23:35] hour giving out 30 more minutes of your
[23:36] time we're not asking for something I'm
[23:38] not asking for you to go outside and and
[23:40] you know it's like I always say
[23:42] everybody puts the Ten Commandments out
[23:43] in the art the devil laughs at that the
[23:47] devil literally laughs it putting ten
[23:49] commandments out in your garden you can
[23:51] put them in stone I saw one time when
[23:53] they had one it was in really and marble
[23:55] how to be light shining moment but if
[23:58] that's not in here say don't care you
[24:02] can put you can put it in front of them
[24:03] the white house if you want to say I'm
[24:06] just gonna go high but it's gotta be in
[24:10] here somewhere with a revival you'd not
[24:12] post a big banner out somewhere right
[24:15] there will laugh at that then but when
[24:19] you start doing things that you don't
[24:20] normally do there are four god that's a
[24:24] revival that satan can't stand he can
[24:26] understand that that's the party
[24:27] kingston that has born in patience and
[24:34] for my name's sake hast laboured and
[24:35] hast not fainted nevertheless I have
[24:37] somewhat now he's got somewhat jars not
[24:39] gonna watch this church age off he's
[24:42] still feeling the people with the Holy
[24:43] Ghost listen listen to this when they
[24:48] accepted the Father Son Holy Ghost
[24:50] baptism he's still filled with the hose
[24:52] all right
[24:55] don't tell me John well actually what
[24:57] fool the holy God Martin Luther when
[24:59] full of the Holy Mother Brown fan these
[25:01] are seven stars in God's hands but he
[25:06] winked at the ignorance of man that had
[25:08] started these doctrines in God it was so
[25:10] prevalent he says okay I got somewhat
[25:13] against you I'm gonna allow that until
[25:17] because my Bible says Satan saying this
[25:22] is what my Bible says the one that wrote
[25:25] the Bible's right here and he said that
[25:27] there would be a ministry coming the
[25:29] endtime that would take us back to him
[25:31] so they weren't required we are required
[25:35] they weren't required click on somewhat
[25:37] see what well there's no it's not
[25:41] underlined anything mm-hmm
[25:43] anything that you see this see it's the
[25:45] towel size there is no that's exactly
[25:51] what it says in the original okay
[25:53] everybody got there there is no strong
[25:56] concordance of a different definition of
[25:58] someone because some what means what
[26:01] part I have somewhat against you there's
[26:06] something I have against you not
[26:08] everything like thing he's not gonna
[26:10] erase the church age but now he does
[26:12] tell them own down here another church
[26:13] and he said if you don't repent I may
[26:15] pull your candlestick out that's lunch
[26:19] remember therefore from whence thou art
[26:23] fallen and repent and do the what the
[26:26] first works or else I will come unto
[26:29] thee quickly and rule their news and
[26:31] will remove thy candlestick out of its
[26:33] place except thou repent well they must
[26:36] have repented cup the candlestick stayed
[26:37] there right but this thou hast that thou
[26:43] hatest see that's the part of some what
[26:46] he didn't like this part but this party
[26:48] really likes you hate the deeds of the
[26:51] Nicolaitans and so do i they were
[26:53] getting organized in here and the power
[26:57] was on the pit of the preacher nothing
[27:00] people right and the people remember it
[27:05] started as a deed a little a little oh
[27:07] say
[27:09] well what about this what Jesus couldn't
[27:11] be really God and man at the same time
[27:15] he's got to be that that God standing up
[27:18] hearing he creates this other body in he
[27:21] makes this son and then that son then
[27:24] there's a Holy Ghost over here with a
[27:25] little dove you know fluttering around
[27:27] like brother so that's just a saying
[27:32] deed it becomes a doctrine later yes in
[27:37] James it says when lust is conceived it
[27:39] bringeth forth sin when sin is finished
[27:41] it bring it forth death all right so
[27:45] we'll go right here and then we'll stop
[27:46] for this Tim 12 we're going up there
[27:48] but this thou hath thou hatest the deeds
[27:50] of the Nicolaitans which i also hate he
[27:55] too has an ear let him hear what the
[27:56] spirit saith unto the churches
[27:57] to him that overcometh will I give to
[28:00] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[28:02] midst of the paradise of God you see
[28:05] that that's a promise
[28:07] all the way to the future home because
[28:09] the tree life's not in the Millennium
[28:11] the tree lost in the future home read
[28:14] your Bible all right we know we're part
[28:16] of the tree a lot but tree alive Jesus
[28:18] Christ is going to be standing right
[28:21] there eat of the tree of life which is
[28:23] in the midst of the paradise of God
[28:25] let's go
[28:28] [Music]
