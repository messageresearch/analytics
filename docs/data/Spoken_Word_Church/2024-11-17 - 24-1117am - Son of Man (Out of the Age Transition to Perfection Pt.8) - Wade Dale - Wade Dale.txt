your wives or your husbands you know how it is when you've been around them for a long time it's just really tough when you're by yourself and she's made the decision to go and she wanted me to

early it's about three hours difference in time so but that's okay but we sure appreciate she'd been here forever and ever and ever her and brother Ray and then then the Lord took Brother Ray home

can do to help her maybe we sure will miss her amen man we sure will miss her we love you with the love of the Lord and we appreciate all of you coming today so let's uh before we turn in our Bibles there's two things I want to um tell you I looked up these uh it's a Thanksgiving time that we're having if you're not thankful for what you have then likely you'll not be thankful for what you're going to get think about that be thankful God told us be thankful in everything we do everything yes even the tragedy be thankful am be thankful for what you have you'll end up having more if you concentrate on what you don't have you will never ever have enough that's right amen think about that amen amen Lord bless you let's we're going to talk today on we're still on the son of man part 854 but this will be uh out of the age and we'll explain that in a little bit transition to Perfection so let's bow our heads before we go to scripture thank you Lord for the things that we have and I thank you Lord for the things that's coming father we're in a Time Lord that we believe that it's the end of all things it's time not to play it's time to get busy and get serious come out of the things that we have that are that are tagging along with us Lord as we'll read Paul in just a few minutes and father I pray that you'd bless us today Lord thank you for bringing us our natural food today through our brothers and sisters and I pray now that you'll bless the spiritual food that's coming forth heal the sick Lord Heal the sin sick father and ask you to be with the ones that are traveling brother John duret and his mother had an accident so he's with her today and he sent us a message so just we pray that you she's not seriously hurt but she may the may be total but Lord thank you for saving her her her life Lord and we we thank you for all things that you've done for us and the things that are coming forward in Jesus name we pray amen amen Malachi 4 says behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yeah all that do wickly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as cows of the stall what a positive attitude that this should be for us cuz listen folks this is our scripture okay and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet and the day that I shall do this sayth the Lord of host remember ye the law of Moses my servant remember Jesus Christ didn't do away with the law he magnified it and made it where you could live it everybody with me that's what he he came under the law to get us from under the law but the law was not you can't do away with the Old Testament so Malachi is telling us to remember you the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in horor for all Israel with the statutes and judgments Now Behold I will send you somebody say you you thank you you talking to me behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse you may be SE the Lord has his Blessing before we get started I want to I want to read something that we need to be aware of not I'm not trying to be political but we live under political government do you know that Trump told the Christians if they'd vote for him they' never have you never have to vote again uh let me read that July the 27th Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told Christians on Friday if they vote for him in December in four years you won't have to vote again we'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to vote he added I love you Christians I'm a Christian I love you get out you got to get out and vote in four years you don't have to vote again we'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to vote that's right I hope we ain't hear four years but now n no Christians will be here in four years they'll be here for a while cuz they're not going to make the Rapture what we've been talking about with the foolish virgin and the wise virgin to be a lamp trimming time but just just beware be cautious everybody's caught up everybody's drunk with with Trump now just be cautious we're Christians we're the real Christians if he's a Christian I'm the Pope I'm sorry there's nothing moral about the person there's nothing moral about this world this world is doomed that's why that he tells us right here in the scriptures in Revelations well you know what Revelations 10:7 but Revelation 18 for all nations now watch all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication which is who her is Rome right right and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth right right ecclesiastical commercial that's right just like Constantine that's right brought them together and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice thank God for another voice yes sir you can say Amen today if you want to thank God for another voice that we heard behold I will send you Elijah the prophet hallu in the days of the voice of that man you're going to hear from me God said you're not going to hear this garbage is going around all over the world you're going to hear straight from me yes sir I hope today you come expecting to hear from God not from me cuz it will be a failure if you come to hear from me and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues you see all the plagues that's fallen for her sins have reached into heaven for God hath remembered her iniquities rewarded her reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her listen we got a double portion of the word of God Amen that's right right since we're the Elisha we got a double portion from Brother Brown's Ministry we got a double portion of it right don't get quiet on me we got a double portion well guess what God's going to give a double portion to them people out there that reject it too this nation's doomed I don't carees like brother Bob said the other day it don't matter what happens there's not anything positive going to White House it's going to save us it's going to make it better but I'll promise you in the next several months you're going to see Prosperity like you've never seen before people are going to get on board they're going to get on board and and the Christians are going to do their thing the nominal Christians but we have got to as uh this message came as I driving down the road coming back home uh Saturday night to come out of that yes that's right we don't listen we can't put oursel in a commune come on we kill each other at this point but when we get to heaven we're all going to live together but we're all in our humanity and uh you're not going to no commune is not a way to go but we are going to be what United under one head I'll promise you the bride will be United under one headship yes sir when that head says arm move whoever the arm is that arm will move whoever says finger move which is we know as the Lord we know the headship of Christ is he here yes under the word of God I believe that I don't believe there's another head coming I don't believe there's another message coming there's not another Prophet coming to us now there's one going to Israel but not one coming to us right amen so the world is going to be rewarded double and brother Bri talked about America turning the word down God sent us a prophet in our language yes our language so that we all can understand it right and what do we done with it the world's turned it down nominal Christianity has turned it down amen so you're going to get double according to her words look at acts 16:16 I just want to take my pretense from right here and go forward with it and it came to pass as we went to to prayer brother Bob was talking about the Sorcerer And all all that stuff hangs around remember Judas and Jesus hung around each other right no no one knew who Judas was except Jesus and he was the son of man he was the word the other 11 had no clue who he was all right so it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with the spirit of divination met us which brought her Masters much gain by what Soo saying we don't have soothsayers in this message we have people that have thus sayth the Lord in this message I believe that brother R said we'll have thus sayith the Lord and we'll quit or we quit we won't talk we'll be still but I believe we have thus sayith the Lord everything we're talking about now is thus sayith the Lord because it comes straight out of the Bible right the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the Servants of the most high God which show unto us the way of Salvation and this did she many days but Paul being grieved now watch turned and said to the spirit he didn't say to the woman he said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour that's what we're doing today folks we're preaching the word of God trying to drive those demons you see I don't have demons you already got one of deception we all have them we got them hanging around and we need to get rid of them amen we need to say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ whatever you got problem you got today cast it out you don't need a preacher to come cast it out for you you don't need a prophet to come back and cast it out for you you say unto this mountain be moved that's what we're heading toward folks let me tell you something we got to up at a notch yes right right yeah we do I was coming down the road and I've been listening to the seals for Years brother Bob read the book many many times and I had it on and my the second and third seal I got more out of that than I'd ever got before but it wasn't time then it's time now you and I have got to come to a time though but you got to realize one thing we've went through justification I'll read it if I have time we've went through sanctification we've went through the baptism of the Holy Ghost now we are in the Incarnate Word age sir that's no fooling around that's Incarnate Word age you can have the Holy Ghost that's okay that's good but what are you doing with it brother Brown said Incarnate Word is what's going to take us out of here the son of man was the Incarnate Word amen and where's he at today oh he's over y under somewhere oh he's over in the building he's in a tape recorder I hurt somebody's feelings he was in a tape recorder he was online no he's in his people and his people will respond to what he says amen hallelujah listen to this invisible Union brother Brand This is a thanks message that he had in sort but one of the greatest most powerful messages that you could have for a Thanksgiving is that you are in Union with Jesus Christ you may say what's this got to do with Thanksgiving what you talking about brother brandom here it is quarter to nine you had said anything about Thanksgiving what a message for the occasion to me yes indeed the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their new found way of life now watch being separated are called out MH right right come out of her where today what the whole theme is come out of her yes sir get out of the age you're in listen we have to live in Leota we're impacted by Leota you drove your Leota car here today you did not drive a horse and buggy amen amen but listen you don't need to get caught up in it though come out of that thing amen if that Demon's hanging around you cast it out in the name of Jesus Christ you do it well I'm scared scared of what what are you scared of what you scared of you're God's people you're the chosen you're here for a purpose you're here to cast that demon out you're here to know what the word says you're here to have power over the devil that's your option that you have and I say an option yeah you can just do like that woman that woman was making money off of it and some people were H hanging around her were making money off of her and she was just divining or doing divination maybe she'd hit it a little bit maybe she'd miss a little bit but when she hit it man it was good we don't have a hit and miss gospel no sir we don't have a hit Miss God the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their Newfound way of life being separated now watch what brother Brown says from the old English denominations and Creeds they could marry to the new anointed word for their age when those pilgrims hit Plymouth Rock they were anointed to be in America we listen I'm sorry do we believe was a prophet are we in the right are we in the right place okay we do believe brother Brown was a prophet right okay and what he said was true okay just want to make sure nobody left and come back brought somebody else with them they could marry to the new anointed word for their age that's right the new anointed word of their age for their day justification was fine in its day sanctification was listen it was fine in your day but you got to get out of it you got to keep moving cuz God moved the baptism of the Holy Ghost now he's moved from just the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the very word incarnate yes what was Jesus Jesus do he he he wasn't just the Holy Ghost he was incarnate God he was God walking around in human flesh what are we and the Word was made flesh D my old brother wait that was back in Jesus's time he made a way for it to be in our time and he sent us a prophet to open the book to reveal that it was in our time and that we can live it amen amen I can't W I ever help you I can't well maybe you can't but God can't if you give it to him Hallelujah as brother Joe was saying let him fight for you he said he'd fight we got to quit fighting him that's right that's right remember the old man met the met the old brother and said well H old brother said I'm a Christian said said uh the other brother said well how long you been in this blessed way he said all about 45 years been this blessed way about 45 years that old man looked at him and said that's your problem you've been in the way for 45 years Hallelujah maybe I'll keep you awake for a little while so can we be thankful as pilgrims now he's bringing us back as pilgrims oh yeah like Abraham separated ourself from the things of the world all of our Associates can we do that can we separate ourselves from the world we have to live in it but not be of it Abraham was a pilgrim God has separated us from all the dead religions amen I ain't speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds and to what separated us and open to us a new land a new message for this day yes recognizing your day and its message yes sir Pentecost dried up and died like Luther Wesley and the rest of them it's no more than a bunch of churches pulled together and guess what they're going to pull together you watch church and States coming back together again Constantine put them together back there and you know who's going to put them together now economy government religion Satan loves them all separated us and opened to us a new land a new message for this day Pentecost dried up and died like Luther Wesley and the rest of them it's no more than a bunch of churches good people in there yet has got to come out right see like brother Herman Garland he might have did you ever go to brother Bri's meeting were you in but you were in Pentecost all right yeah see he was in Pentecost he was waiting that time to hear that message though when he he heard that voice Pentecost wasn't there anymore he had a new Pentecostal experience he had the real Pentecost give me the real Pentecost right but he was just this is what this is a quote that he was setting in he was setting in Pentecost waiting for this message to cross his path good people in there yet has got to come out if you're a true seed of God you will come you can't be in a denomination and be a true seed of God you can't do it and listen to be the Incarnate Word you're going to separate from a lot of people in so-called message oh yes sir I'll say am man myself what did he do he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message that's our key we are not closed book people we are open book people with every Revelation every mystery everything that we need is right here in our in our right in our hands you got on your phone you notice that the Seven Seals which all the mysteries of the seven Church Ages was sealed with Seven Seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in their day they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation of the Seven Seals is open to us in this last day amen everybody with me but now remember we were talking about last Sunday Elijah said if you can see me leave all right if you can see me go I'll give you a double portion right right now brother collie we've seen him leave and if your Revelations he's got to come back that's okay fine with me you have it but I'm not waiting on him Elisha didn't Elisha took that Manel smed it and said where be the god of Elijah walked out and did eight Miracles eight more or did more than Elijah did and you know what he done he separated from that group of prophets who been hanging around him hello remember the school of prophets them boys that were prophets they were false right right he separated himself from that you and I got to separate oursel from the past that we've done not our past life I hope that's already done by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen thank you Lord but you got to separate yourself from that thing that's been dragging along with you like Paul had to do right and each one of us have one right and it came to pass ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me now what was the stipulation he had to see him leave he had to see him leave and he had to know that he left cuz there was a group of people came to him right after that the next day or so and said where's Elijah we're going to go look for him Elisha said go right ahead but you're not going to find him that's why I tell people now you go ahead and look for brother random you not going to find him his message is in his people yes sir in the days of the voice under your messenger you are the final voice of the final age you are the one that's going to speak the word you're the one that's going to bring the dead out of the ground you're the one that's going to bring William Bram out of the ground oh I I you know you look at that day that when Jesus resurrected and the two angels are sitting there you know and Mary and Martha whoever it is comes in and looks and says where's Jesus we thought he was dead remember what the angel said why seek ye the living among the dead why are we seeking the living among the dead that we've all been through all of us has been through something but we got to come out of that come into this new Thanksgiving we're going to have turkey and dressing well let's get the word of God right first and then we can have our turkey and dressing I'm not saying we're wrong I'm just telling you we got to step it up a little bit amen somebody was saying the other day you know the the Bible says that that people have said all since the dawn of time brother brother Joie that that the Lord's coming since the dawn of time and well Grandma said he was coming grandpa said he was coming I'll promise you folks they're all gone right amen some of you sitting here to today are going to see that coming to the Lord you're going to see that thing being fulfilled but you got to say that's me that's not for Grandma you got to make it personal that's for me but we got to start acting like it like brother Bob said church is important yes if it wasn't brother Brandon wouldn't tell you that if you were a Christian you couldn't wait for the doors to open that's right so you could U press play so you could talk to God if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so we're moving on right so now this messenger is going to do two things we've talked about the layout of seean age we know what it is listen as we went through all those Church ages we had to give you history right we had to give you what this one said about Luther what this one said about Wesley and what this said about this the commentators right cuz they were all gone now brother bram's gone but we've got his message yes that we know that this is it amen there's no more you're living in it absolutely so I don't have to read that all I don't have to read that stuff that we have to go through in the lukewarm and neither hot nor cold and y'all know that you're sitting in it some of y'all are lukewarm that there we arms folded and can't can't even worship when somebody says Worship You worship God don't worship the next person beside you sorry about that but it's truth anyhow maybe it'll make your potatoes taste better now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things so we've got a messenger that didn't just do one thing Luther come and preach justification when off the scene he wasn't requireed ired to preach am I doing okay preach sanctification all right I'm talking about The Interpreter Sister Christine slows me down and sister Regina slows me down when I'm when I'm going too fast we sure want them to to understand and we don't want brother Lise to blow a fuse in that room in there his fuse not a fuse in the church his fuse just pray for brother Louise he preaches all the time he's back there behind the scene preaching all the time and I praise God that that he's a wonderful preacher and that he can catch the mind of God I'm sorry but better than a leoty cuz he's used to preaching he knows the way it's going to go and so so Brother Carlos God bless y'all thank you for bringing that out of brother Louise we got a lot of different languages in here today but we got one God we got one message am so this messenger of Malachi 4 is going to do two things now watch one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers now look what was that doing that was taking justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost as it fell on the day of Pentecost and bringing us back to that that's right the right way of doing it not that you speak in tongues you got the Holy Ghost Devils do the same thing that's right you can be justified without being Sanctified you can be Sanctified without being filled with the Holy Ghost that's a direct quote from brother randam because I had it on the third seal I think it was coming down the road but you look and see that brother randam as we were talking about Elijah remember on Mount Carmel Elijah stood there and he mocked the religion of the day oh he's on vacation maybe you need to holler a little louder but what did they do they tore that altar down and Elijah put that thing back together Revelation by Revelation Stone by Stone Stone he put that altar back together William brandom during his first part of his ministry that's what he did he brought the people back to believe that you got to be justified but you can't stay that way you got to be Sanctified but you can't stay that way you got to get the Holy Ghost apart from any emotion right amen huh yes sir that's right I had a feeling I can pour water down your back and get a feeling that's what brother Dale always said you put down your back I get I get cold chills no doubt but brother Ram then when he come to the second part of his ministry though he kept bring he always said three three God is in three right God is in threes God is in threes God is in threes but then he comes up and and when he comes up to about the spoken words Original Seed I'll read it to you in a minute he talks about four restoration of the brid tree he talks about four manifest ation justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word now wasn't it the word wasn't here but it's the fullness the Incarnate of the word so one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers I pray today that you have been turned back amen you got to know that yourself that you've been turned back from that Old way you used to be yes sir so that was the first part of his ministry that was his brother said not in the years of preparation that was in the years of preparation he was getting the listen if you don't have the Holy Ghost today you're not going to understand what I'm saying right you can get a feeling or you can get an intellectual conception or you can say I think I know what he's talking about but if you got the Holy Ghost the word of God is prevalent in your life you will understand what's going on God's obligated to give it to you yes sir amen so the second part of his ministry according to Revel Gans 10:7 he's going to reveal something not different but total not something different but something total something to give you Perfection something to make you act different the Holy Ghost ought to make you act different anyway listen sanctification ought to make you act different right that's why a lot of people get hung you know me if you've listened to me many years sanctification is a wonderful place to be but is a horrible place to be and stay right amen uhhuh well I don't smoke anymore I don't drink anymore I don't do this anymore I even go to church so did Judas Judas had sanctification God cleaned his life up as far as he could come on people Jesus said sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth and Judas was standing there right brother Rand many many times he'll tell you Judas was was justified and Sanctified nobody knew who he was though except the son of man nobody he had deceived everybody but the son of man he did not receive Jes deceive Jesus Jesus knew from the beginning that he was the son of predition that's what brother Brown said in the third seal I believe it was so two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders now don't get all don't get all we're we're going to talk about the Thunders here in a little bit we're going to get into the doctrine now starting in just couple weeks maybe about the first of the year get around uh cold time when people don't go on vacation they'll actually come to church I'm sorry that it takes that to get you here listen I'm just one that believes in church I am sorry tell put it in the tell me where it ain't in the Bible right tell me where your Prophet said go do what you want to do you'll be fine no like I said before you can't wait for the doors to open to get in not to eat turkey and dressing but to Fellowship around the word of God listen brother Ram called this a place of healing this is the hospital that's right I'm sure we still believe you was a prophet I'm I still got the same group here right he said this was a hospital for healing and not just healing of your body right absolutely I need thisen I need this like I said couple you know last week I asked the Lord Saturday morning I said Lord if you'll give me a deer and give me a nice buck that morning I'll drive back home that night and be back church Sunday was I I God give me the deer I killed it put it in the procession drove right back home got home by 11:30 same thing this weekend and next weekend it'll be the same thing I believe trust God just ask him sometimes say God I'll do that but now listen if you say I'll do this cuz you know what I'm going to break back I'm going to be honest with you I wanted to stay Sunday cuz the movement of the deer and everything was getting ready but I said God give me the deer that morning I'll be home that after that evening 7 hours drive and I'll be a church and he did that for me so I just ask the Lord to do that for you ask him sometime ask and you shall receive seek you shall find knock it shall be open unto you right right but there was never a time my brother sitting back there my sister sitting back there getting old but there was never a Sunday that I can remember that got up and said I don't think I just don't think I'm going to go to church today never mom never was there an option amen and God granted him the word of God that you've been that you're living on now the foundation that you have now that's why he gave it to God and let God take over and let God do what he said he would do amen let's trust God don't trust a man don't put your trust in no man fail you every time put your trust in God so brother randman has got two parts his first part is he's the healing campaign remember the first pull we'll get into that later on but that is the healing campaign now listen healing campaign is fine we all need some kind of healing today but that healer is still here sir you don't need a prophet to come back and lay hands on the Bible says lay hands on the SI and they shall recover but brother random didn't come just to bring us back to the faith of the fathers cuz they're all dead everybody's dead till today but there had to be a message to be a resurrection message not a restoration message we all got to come to be restored amen all of us that are born again today you are restored back to the faith of the fathers but now you still got to go up at statute of perfect man cuz that is the faith of the fathers you can't say well I just believe brother R was a prophet can't happen cannot happen we are required and if we're required if it is required curriculum come on we have got a way to get there yes sir God can't say do this and but no you can't make it over there I want you to do this I require that you do this but it'll be too tough you just don't worry about it no God's got a group of people that says I want that out of me that's keeping me from getting out that's what I want I see the things I need to get out thank do you so number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these deviling now listen it was divinely revealed to the prophet during his first part of the of the of the age he was in that was the excuse me the Discerning of the thoughts intents of the heart but now he's going deeper he's going deeper into the word of God he's not bringing the threes now he's bringing the fours right amen you and I are living in a required four right you say oh that's a bad number not when it comes to Redemption right not when it comes to Redemption you'll never get fully redeemed without a four right but it is a number of man it is a it isn't but it is a restoration number listen for combat Beast we'll read it in just a second everybody all right it's 12:00 I know some of you may be but just hang on to it a minute I'll guarantee you for what we got downstairs if you leave hungry your mouth got so jut don't try that he we were revealed the mysteries of the seven Thunders so there's Mysteries that's got to come out that was not revealed any other time amen it was good that God sent a prophet it was good that we know we got to be justified it's good that we know we got to be Sanctified am I making any sense today we have come through that part of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seed come alive in our heart the word of God is precious to us Yes precious to us absolutely right but we got one more step to do that's right got one more step we're this close that's correct Hallelujah I believe the people listen we got the president to do it now I'm just going to say that a woman couldn't do it sorry but a man can do it a man with ecclesiastical power he says he's a Christian right and he's got definitely got the economic power so here we are right listen we're on the road folks are that's right we got about two years to get to 2026 the end of it that's you better watch what's going on that's right I'm telling you amen not trying to scare nobody because you know what people didn't get didn't get scared before Regina oh grandma said she's coming he's com brother Bram said I uh I was listening to one of the sermons coming down the road it wasn't on the seals but he said the the coming of the Lord is close at hand that was in 1962 how much more we standing at at the door I don't believe we're standing at the door we got our nose stuck to the door that's right listen you believe it or not are you going to be sitting here when the tribulation starts I'm sorry it's lamp trimming time it's time to put the oil in the lamp it's time to hear the bridegroom cry and it's got to come from a five-fold Ministry it cannot come any other wayen praise the Lord any here true and we are Revelation people brother BR said we love revelation and Satan hates it that's right so guess what every time you get a revelation that's one against the old boy devil you can't get me now this is where it's at many of you we baptized 30 something people the past couple years what you say out in the water put it down right here right right this is it right here I'm putting it down right here I ain't being baptized 13 14 more times we'll do that but you got to put a state down some where and go back and say devil that's where it all changed that's where I changed I'm not worried about the rest of you I want to know where I'm going to be changed amen I'm here to help you Hallelujah but I'm not here to change you can't do it you got to change yourself let God change you amen that's right choice the Revelation contained in the Seven Seals now watch it will be these divinely revealed so it's not going to be revealed brother brother Herman it's not going to be revealed to just a whole group of people right right that's right come on brother R said out of the true church yes will come a church out of the two seeds in the framework of the message Church they'll come one it's honing time and brother R said it's time that that Pyramid has got he can't set that on this right he's got to set that right where it's at righten amen and it'll take divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children of the Pentecostal fathers listen we're here like I said before we are not a prophecy we're a reality we're living it right now we know what he'll be it be in the nature of Elijah we know that but the Lord yourself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which your alive and remain shall be caught up together that's why I said before we are not looking for a Rapture oh boy now some of y'all the older ones you going to go wait a minute this church is not looking for a Rapture that's right we've been taught not to look for a Rapture that's right amen what Brother D say the Rapture was it's in you but what did he say it was it was a culmination of what happened before cuz Rapture is ecstasy Rapture is not in the Bible right Rapture is an ecstasy Rapture is what it's you being you can have a Rapture right here that's right but there's one day we're all going to leave this place but we've got to have a resurrection message that's why we can't go around the son of man Ministry we can't go around be incarnate in a bride that's right we can't go around it cuz he stood one day and said Lazarus come forth who was that that was a son of man and I was in him you were in him yes sir you got the new birth today you said the same thing think about that yes where's that shout coming from we know it's the message that God sent us that's right the voice of the Archangel brother we'll we'll let him explain that here in just a second everybody all right don't be smelling none that food back there in the back so a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth now listen you everybody sitting in this room today has been in the message for at least a year or two or three or four or 40 50 60 we have heard that shout we have fulfilled that scripture we have heard the message the living bread of life bringing forth the bride yes now he continues on the first thing comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what it's a message to get the people together we're so separated together yes a message comes forth first now lamp trimming time as I said before rise and trim your lamps if some of you young kids don't know what it is maybe I'll remember one day to bring one but that light will be absolutely on it'll be on fire but it'll be so smudy it'll be so black you got to trim that off listen it's not lamp throwing away time it's trimming time it's honing time it's a message to get the people together a message come forth first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps what watch was it the seventh not the sixth it's Malachi four time what he promised Luke 17 Isaiah all these prophecies that it can listen brother brandham prophesied about me and you but as I read to you last Sunday I hope you believe that it wasn't for them people he said it wasn't for them go to questions and answers on the seals read the first five paragraphs he said it's not for you gone from you you're not even supposed to get it now he's not talking to this group here I'm not talking to y'all Y y'all ain't getting it now there's another this is it this is the come out we got to come out and in am all these prophecies that it could perfectly set in order for this day in the scriptures we see it living right there what is it living in a tree living in a car living in a boat living in people people amen now continue on the Rapture message the second is a voice of the Resurrection now you got to come through the shout you got to hear it and you got to become the shout come that's right did Joshua shout when the walls of Jericho come down don't be afraid to answer that he did not that's right he told him what to do he said when you shout the walls will fall that's right amen the second is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice the same voice a loud voice in St John that called Lazarus from the grave and who was that that was the son of man amen that was incarnate God that could raise somebody up just for by speaking their name brother Brown said you know what if he had to called lazarus's name he said all of them would have come out right right all of them would have come out but Lazarus come forth am do you really believe that amen we're not going to go to a gravide and just and all of us kind of huddle around and start screaming it'll be the quietest thing ever happened on the face of the Earth cuz it's a secret them brothers and sisters are not going to have to dig their way out of a grave you'll never see it there'll still be tombstones out there says Samuel D B dig way out we're digging him out now that's right we EXA are the final voice to the final age they without us cannot be made perfect that's scripture how we go are we going to really really realize that because he sent us a message that we can do that but we got to come out of all that got you thinking thinking what's killing us our thoughts our thought well you're dead right Jesus never one time said I thought he said I say unto you verely verely I say unto you listen listen but did they listen to him no did they listen to brother randam no more denominations now than ever was brother RAM on that side believe an invisible union he said I come to shreport he said I preach about long short hair he said you just keep bobbing your hair off until you get it in your soul you're not going to you may play you may the pig put lipstick on it but you turn that baby loose going back to the mud that's why I'm telling you we got to get in the word and know we're in the word or we are going to go back to what we were doing before now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky so the dead in Christ shall rise what all right so what are we looking for we're looking for a resurrection first and then we which are alive and remain will be changed come on this is Bible absolutely huh right and then we'll go in the air to meet the Lord number three which is the rapture I hope we get that I'm not saying don't say we're not we're looking we hope the Rapture comes but you got to have a resurrection first yes sir amen you got to have us having our body changed first or second actually that's going to be the Paradox we're going to be standing here and Donnie's going to be 70 something years old than you're welcome and his voice is going to ring out and them dead Saints are coming here this is not fairy tale this is the truth someone will have the voice of the Resurrection in their voice in their voice amen and they say come out of the grave and still be 70 something years old probably still hurting from arthritis and and wobble up to the to the great see because this is a secret God hid this thing he's hid it from everybody but the real true bride only the bride will know who she is that's a paradox that God's going to allow the resurrection to be in our voice to change the bodies of those dead Saints and us standing here and still be the age that we are but it will happen I promise you it's going to happen it's thus sayth the Lord it'll happen amen cuz then we see them and then we get enough faith maybe for our own bodies to change cuz that's what the Bible says we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be what changed and caught up to meet the Lord in the air let's look for a resurrection message let the Resurrection start in you let the resurrection today this Thanksgiving coming up week let that start in you be thankful that God give you this there's billions of people in the world that will never hear this that's right number one it makes you happy and number one it makes you sad both number ones cuz you're sad and happy at the same time you sit and watch you go to an airport and there's well in Atlanta there's thousands of people walk by that'll never know what you know that's the truth never know that's right and remember I asked the Lord one time I said Lord why why me sitting here by myself getting ready to go preach for somebody I think I was going to Oklahoma actually preach for brother Claude and why me he said you know what he said you answered the call right that's right that's so simple I didn't dress right didn't act right you answered the call that's right absolutely right you answered the call Cuz listen you believe whatever you want to but predestination you got a lot to do with it hello those who he fornew he did predetermine to be here only by his foreign knowledge brother R said he can predestinate cuz listen predestination is stamped yes predetermined Destiny because of the mind of God knowing everything but by his for knowledge knowing the day you'd want it put it in your path and you took it let's thank God for that everybody he put it in your path what you do with it though have you Let It Go [Applause] by Sister Jessica back there with her hand up God bless her heart I appreciate her got something special in my heart for her no offense Chris just didn't know you but her Grandpa her Grandpa think about how the word Works her Grandpa was one of our first pastors before we've started this church her Grandpa her mama was a baby when we were starting to go to church and now you see a beautiful granddaughter sitting here listening to some ding-dong that was just a little shnot noosed kid in 1969 and now here we are she knows I mean she looks just like her mom when her mom was a little anyway but see that's how the word of God does when it crosses your path see I could have responded different though and I did for a while I just wasn't in the message for till just today no I had my conversation in times past as Paul said in the lust of the flesh but in the time appointed amen amen everybody has got a time appointed you're either going to have that time here or you going to have it there everybody all right the third thing is a trumpet which is the Feast of the trumpets it's calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky so you got to shout The Voice the trumpet's going to sound we're going to be gone voice of the trumpet third thing all right token message little bit more it's only 12:19 we got two more hours amen oh me didn't say a word there's always three in the crowd we still believe brother Brown was a prophet right make Believers unbelievers and True Believer so anyway so we're going to go on for you Believers and I believe it's all of you I'm just I'm just foing around I just I have a I told God coming down the road and was listening to that tape I believe it was a second or third seal and I said God we're living this is we're living this out it's not on the tape anymore no it's sister milk is not on the tape anymore that's good that's fine not doing away with him not we wouldn't know who we were without brother brand being here but he's gone his voice is what's resonating in our heart to get us out of here yes amen that's what I'm proud to tell you that's my Thanksgiving message is we have an opportunity oh my listen the pilgrims they sailed to a new land that some of them probably had never been before but they wanted to get out of what they were in which was what what religious persecution they wanted to get out so they went to America a new land that maybe there was a little bit of apprehension they met the Indians first right but now you look at this land now how populated it is all from that one plump coming to Plymouth Rock somewhere you had a Plymouth Rock somewhere your boat landed on rock and what have you done with it it's your business brother Brown said look no other time could this message ever come forth till now Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man the message could not be till now right but now remember he was prophesying it's not for you right you want me to read that quote again I got it to the very end if you don't believe me go to questions and answers on the seals read the first five paragraphs he said you're not getting it it's not for you right he said go and live a simple Christian Life these things will be made known what it's be made known now no other time could this message ever come forth till now Jesus said as was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man boy don't we know we live in a sodomite condition the message could not be till now the world wasn't in the condition that's right as until it's in right now this is the hour that Jesus could appear at any time do we believe that foreal now watch notice fully Satan on his throne yes sir offered it to God offered it to our Lord here he is sitting here with this beastly heart in him now here's the person the Beast the Incarnate devil all right he makes his appearing here on Earth under the false pretense oh my goodness under the false pretense of the true word I have that underlined for a reason he Associates himself with the word am that's right he's sitting here today listening to what we're talking talking about but praise God he can't get a revelation like we can get he can't get a heart change like we get I ought to make you real happy he did just the same thing his type did which was Judas 2,000 years ago what did he do Judas came in as a Believer being a devil from the beginning he was born the son of predition he pulled nothing over on the son of man cuz he knowed him from the very beginning for he was the word you and I got to be the word nothing else the word made manifest and nothing else not just reading it kids being it right right so this Elijah just a few minutes is to restore all things but he's got to do it in four stages all right I want to tell you something real quick this is not we're going to get into this later on at the end of every seven years now this is Deuteronomy according to the law at the end of every seven years Thou shalt make a release all right real quick for those of you that's got your eyes closed pay attention um not you cuz you're sitting up here in the front all right listen real quick what happened in the Old Testament if you couldn't pay your debt all right if you owed somebody something you owed them some time you ow him some money blah blah blah whatever you could go to work for him for seven years remember what remember what Jacob did with Leah she he fulfilled her week he worked seven years to get Leah or to get Rachel and he got tricked and got Leah and had to work seven more years he must have really loved her brother Jim cuz he worked 14 years for one woman anyway praise the Lord but anyhow so every seven years though was not a jubilee brother collie that's right it wasn't a jubilee not everything went free only whatever you owed and some of your possessions but if there's all kind of stipulation if you married a woman and at seven years she couldn't go out if she was a Hebrew there was different stipulations and other words they couldn't get all the way out they had to leave some possession but every seven time s is a jubilee which is a 49 and then you got your 50th Jubilee which I've told you many times before I I we preached on it years and years ago it's in the Bible there was a 50th Jubilee but Israel has never ever celebrated a 50th Jubilee that's right go to your history even the history Guy the one online was T he said we've never had a 50th cuz 50 you know how Jews are with money they ain't going to let all their money go but in the in the in the pretense of what we're talking about every seven years there was a release then you counted seven of those seven years we'll get into all this later which is 49 7 * 7 is 49 you had to then that was a one more year there was a total release a golden jubilee that everything went out it didn't matter brother R said you could throw your ho down and take off but remember if you stayed there what' they do they messed with your hearing you couldn't hear no more they bored your ear with an awe and you listen you were slave till you died but you had an opportunity to get out right now listen brother right I'm talking here I had to say that for this if somehow or the other the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God there come a year called The Jubilee year every seven years they had a rest or a Sabbath Sabbath means rest a lot of times they'd let the land rest they'd rotate crops and every seven years they'd let that peach property rest it's all a type every seven days they had a Sabbath we know that every seven years they had a Sabbath and seven Sabbath was 49 years and the 50th was a jubilee so it wasn't if you kept having those seven-year Cycles nobody went free but just a few things a few items got it you had to hit that 50th to throw down the hole to take a body chain to get out of the position that you were in so listen am everybody with me amen Feast of the trumpets now here it is the great thing look the Holy Spirit has been bound by the denominations 2,000 years we find out it has now notice the sabbaths seven sabbaths are seven years are 70 weeks whatever you want to call it they couldn't get all the way out now he's talking about the church ages right how many Church ages are they seven right seven Church ages seven time seven it's 49 you go right back into that same cycle again and you don't get all the way out that's why you and I have got to come out we don't have to just come out of the world we got to come out of this age right we got to come out of the age of this to go free to be in the Jubilee year right amen there'll be a day that neither day or night restoration of the Bride tree so how's this going to happen and if four messengers of death killed the tree four messengers of Life restore the tree do you get it congregation says amen for God said I will restore it now what is what is Elijah's message it's a message of restoration hold on a minute now it's a message of restoration plus amen I just read it to you the first part of Malachi 4 was to restore the hearts of the children back to the fathers justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost but then to take those denominations that it said it was bound by in this quote here and to do away with them to give you a jubilee to get you out of the age right and the four messengers of death killed the tree four messengers of Life restored the tree do you get it he's going to restore it how by four death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley sanctification what was the third Pentecost listen Pentecost wasn't false right brother R said the Holy Ghost came himself on the that on 1906 Street wasn't false that was the true Holy Ghost it had to come back restore the gifts now what they did with it was garbage but it was true at their time but you know what they they didn't move on so watch what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word the word there were four great prophets one of them Martin Luther began to shine a light little bit of light very small strength of justification Wesley stronger with sanctification after Wesley come the stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost and another great Prophet we know who that was the Holy Ghost came himself wasn't brother random everybody with me you you just been here long enough you know that there was no Messenger to that age but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the very word the word of the Lord came to the prophets in the evening lights is to come forth to restore and bring back turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of God fourth light four Killers took it four Messengers destroyed it for messengers of death took it away and Dogma for me messengers of righteousness restore her back again prophesy son of man can these bones live which we had time I got it wrote down here but I have to miss that prophecy can these bones live what's the four stages of that coming forth of that church church brother B says what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only comes not when the skin was on it that was third but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that four message of life amen fourth message Masterpiece 1964 and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself that's not your new birth everybody with me I can't reach at them that right there that's not your new birth you got to be born again down here to even know what these are we know that we taught that that Brother D taught it for 50 years what is that right there though that's bringing back the power of the word not the word the power of the word and a group of people the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection right back to the word again to manifest itself third seal here he comes as the Antichrist false prophet then the Beast then in Dark Age and the church comes out of that Dark Age justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost Incarnate Word the way now H Incarnate Word the way now do you believe that I hope you do he goes he comes down the church goes up the writer is the same one but another stage of his ministry the first stage was a white horse he was just a teacher just an antichrist teacher he was against the word of God and now how can you be an antichrist anybody that denies that every word everybody with me on this remember it be so close and what is so close God and Satan there's the only two Powers right anybody that denies that every word of this isn't true and to be taught just the same is an antichrist cuz they deny the the the word and he is the word se's not air with the shook she was not the seed Mary was not she was a Shu tassel stalk carriers of part of the word not all the word Luther had justification Wesley had sanctification Pentecostal has restoration gifts but when the word come you said brother wait the word been here for a long time it's got to be incarnate in somebody that you can stand and say I and my father are one yes sir a that what brother Bram said I give you a direct quote next Sunday whenever I preach again he said and these other things amen we those other things I want us to get to see something I think sometimes we sit we be in the message church we get lukewarm and it's really hot in here so we're not hot or cold I mean we're not lukewarm we're hot brother collie but we've come to a stage to where it's just become common everything's just become common we just whatever you know it's okay just brother Wade just brother Donnie Reagan just brother you put the moniker you put the name up it's just them people they have a big church up there we got a big church here we got a little church here they got this church over here but what are they saying what's the word doing to you that's right what's the word doing to you is it still letting part of you go free in that seven-year cycle to where you're letting a little bit of it out but you're not letting all of it out have you had your 50th Jubilee for everything will go free even your vile body that was born in sin shapen in iniquity spoused from your mother's womb a liar doomed and on your way to hell that's what brother Ram said amen but God who is rich in Mercy Hallelujah amen he put it in your path for a reason that's right absolutely you're sitting here for a reason that's right you're exactly where you are for a reason don't let that reason be though a Judas I'm sorry you got to cover the two Spirits cuz they're right here in the church yes and I'm not Discerning I don't want no discernment like that cuz I want all y'all love me and I want to know that all of you love me right brother brother Herman everybody love me just smile smile I was listening to third seal brother Brandon was he said something he said it many many times but he stopped and he said watch what you're thinking could you imagine while he was preaching he'd know what a brother or sister was thinking in their mind and God would project that to him and he would have have it in his mind while he's just hammering away just preaching away and he said I just caught your thought don't think that well you know what he done he heard what that person was thinking like what you got in your mind right now I don't want to know fried chicken and turkey and dressing but now watch that wasn't just a quote I gave you this is a brother brandom quote but when you come to say you not me not William brandom you when you say come to say I and my father are one and these other things then the Shu pulls away from it but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God we still believe brother ran was a prophet right okay let me read that one more time but the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever one more quote he's talking about carriers remember the listen the two shoots in Luther's time was was was the life of the message it was alive with the Holy Ghost amen but as you go on up the stock those leaves dry and fall off it becomes stock then it becomes tassel right shuck real corn this is what'll reproduce itself none of this other will reproduce itself a lot of y'all in here Farmers you know that's for sure you don't just run out there in a field of corn you got two shoot sticking up you start har you take your bag out there and start harvesting corn no you got to wait till it Murs and now let it dry in the sun presence of the Sun to ripen it certainly carried but the life left it as soon as it became a leaf it went on out to make something else until it come to its full stature and so will the church come through justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost restoration of the gifts right on into the formed image of Christ Christ is the bridegroom the church is the bride amen and the bride is part of the bridegroom it'll have to be a word church not a denominational Church it'll be the word church the word that's made known and by the Vindicated word of God now watch this is my question to you can you see the difference that don't make us no big big eyes and little yous but there's a difference in men ministry right there's a Pentecostal move in the message that they just dwell on that that's okay I that's okay for them but then there's one that says you're already you know we're waiting on brother randam you got all these different factions but that's not what this is talking about look balum he couldn't see the difference many can't Pharaoh couldn't see it though it Vindicated right before him daythan couldn't see it right can we see it can we come out last one musicians come on Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he's identifying himself as he promised much more could we say in these last days as son of man making himself known among his people look in the form of his people U that's y'all not Son of God not son of David but son of man the Son of God was Supernatural everybody with me on that that's what we had down through seven Church ages we had a supernatural god with a supernatural group of people but they couldn't get their they couldn't get all the denominational ideas out they couldn't get all the things out they couldn't get all the garbage out but now we have a garbage taker a garbage collector called the Holy Ghost incarnate in a group of people to get the garbage out the Son of God was the supernatural hallelujah what is the son of man it's the supernatural in human flesh not just in human flesh but doing the work of the son of man like Abraham he seen voices he heard things seen lights but just before the promised son come God revealed himself as a man in human flesh and read the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart in the room behind him now watch this is them everybody let's stand our feet as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of God coming when the son of man shall be being revealed the son of man being revealed not the Son of God in the church Age We Still Believe brother R was the prophet right not that cycle of sevens you can't have be that cycle of sevens you got to be called out of that the son of man being revealed not the Son of God in the church age he's put out of that now he's the son of man revealing himself the word is becoming flesh Among Us do you believe that amen can we stand it can we take it yes we're pressurized for it no one else was able to do it brother Joe nobody was pressurized except us we're in the astronaut age brother R told us that Time and Time and Time and Time and Time Again again we're in the astronaut age we going to have pressure you're not just an astronaut and and um atmospheric pressure goes away no there's just a way to get through it they built a ship to get through that atmospheric pressure so that it wouldn't kill a human being right is that what it was just pretty simple to tell you that if not then it just Crush everything like those people that got crushed the other day that went like so many miles down in the ocean that was one little fracture that you couldn't even see they said one fracture that's how sinle do one fracture one little sin but what happened was is one little crack it got so hard pressure they said it just within seconds I'm not going to tell you what they said happened to the bodies but it just literally crushed their bones right out of their body they weren't used to the pressure pressure if you're not used to the pressure you're not going to be here you got to be pressurized you got to be in the word of God you got to know your day and hour that you're living in there's nobody can do it but this message of the hour you can't do it with a denominational idea they got too many ideas same Bible 13,000 different ways of preaching it there's only one and yeah we got it yeah we got it but what we going to do with it but we going to let pass on by are we going to take it and let it become incarnate in our life let it be the sole theme of our whole life all God was he poured into Christ all Christ he poured in the church to what have preeminence you know whatever you like it has preeminence and you can let it take over I don't like cutting grass that ain't my prent I like to go hunting that's my preeminence okay but you got to put God first that's your preeminence he wants to have where he can say something and you speak it just the same he wants it to where like back to the condition in the Garden of Eden where Adam spoke and things happened hello come on God didn't have to slow Adam down and say no Adam that big old gray thing with a trunk that's not an elephant the Bible said Adam let me PR paraphrase it Adam picked up the mind of God that was an elephant for eternity hello somebody he didn't change God's mind he just picked up the mind of God when he God help us pick up the mind of God you'll speak what he says and that's when we're going to come to a resurrection that's where we're going to come to the dead Saints coming back to see us God bless you let's sing a song while they get ready downstairs then we'll pray up here and uh enjoy yourself
