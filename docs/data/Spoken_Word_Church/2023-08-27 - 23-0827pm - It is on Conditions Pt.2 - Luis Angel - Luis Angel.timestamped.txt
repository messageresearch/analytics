[14:51] so his plans never fail
[15:08] and one day he put in my path the pastor
[15:12] and so we're here
[15:15] so it's the plans of God
[15:18] I was talking to some of you
[15:21] familiar in Peru a sister said that she
[15:24] had some family from Peru
[15:26] the connections of God are perfect

[15:40] connections of God are perfect
[15:43] God is
[15:51] let's go to the scriptures
[16:02] let's continue with this message titled
[16:05] uh unconditioned
[16:10] John 14 21.

[18:03] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless
[18:07] you brothers and sisters you may you may
[18:09] be seated glorious thank you by the way
[18:17] I was speaking to the pastor and and to
[18:20] some of the Brethren come on
[18:23] how I came to the message
[18:27] you know I was very young when I came to
[18:29] the message
[18:31] very young when I came to the message
[18:34] I met I I I came to the message
[18:39] from Brother Branham himself
[18:42] and don't be scared
[18:51] I used to work part-time at a radio
[18:54] station
[19:00] and they allowed a uh a time slot for to
[19:04] be able to put brother Brown's messages
[19:07] and I didn't know who that was
[19:11] nobody wanted to do that job
[19:14] so I accepted to do that job to put the
[19:18] tapes
[19:20] and let him play for about an hour
[19:23] and then I would take the tape
[19:26] and give way to the rest of the other
[19:28] programming
[19:30] and for many months
[19:33] I was listening to brother Brandon
[19:36] preaching message after message
[19:39] until God touched my heart
[19:43] and then I believed it is and from then
[19:46] already have I haven't left
[19:49] is perfect Brethren it's a perfect
[19:53] message
[19:54] the people fail Peru but the message is
[19:58] perfect
[19:59] because it comes from God
[20:03] I don't know I know some say well
[20:06] it sounds fanatical no senores no it
[20:10] doesn't
[20:11] if you really know the word of God
[20:15] I know the word of God is this message
[20:21] this message is correct it's correct
[20:26] not only am I telling you this just by
[20:29] mouth or word only
[20:32] but the word agrees with that message
[20:36] but you see
[20:38] the people that criticize
[20:40] they only touch certain things only
[20:44] certain quotes
[21:00] remember
[21:03] he said that
[21:05] yeah man you've heard the tape
[21:09] he said don't think on those things
[21:12] don't even listen don't even listen stop
[21:15] to listen to that and that's correct
[21:19] we do not have to uh keep entertaining
[21:23] those things
[21:25] that don't edify us
[21:29] sometimes I have made mistakes preaching
[21:34] the weight has done the same as well
[21:38] but it's In the Heat of the Moment
[21:42] but when you know the scriptures
[21:44] yourself
[21:46] you are called to to to to know the
[21:49] scriptures
[21:51] you can see that there was a mistake
[21:54] but it's there's no problem
[21:59] we're not preaching Mormon Doctrine
[22:04] maybe we we might we might make a
[22:07] mistake on a word on in a Bible
[22:13] [Music]
[22:25] some people say well look brother
[22:27] Brandman did speak about polygamy
[22:30] but if you read the whole message
[22:32] it's not that way
[22:34] right right
[22:38] the ones that have heard or that have
[22:41] read not every month it shouldn't be
[22:44] difficult brother Jesus
[22:46] when Jesus says
[22:49] when Jesus said if you drink my blood
[22:51] and eat my flesh
[22:54] look look at that situation
[22:57] you're a vampire it is you're a cannibal
[23:02] yeah
[23:05] Loco he's crazy
[23:08] the son of the carpenter The Carpenter's
[23:11] son is crazy
[23:12] and I say
[23:15] I told you something's wrong with that
[23:17] man
[23:18] he's not isn't he the son of Mary and of
[23:22] Joseph
[23:25] the ones that had that relationship
[23:27] before they got married
[23:31] now he says he's a vampire and then he's
[23:35] a cannibal yeah he wasn't speaking about
[23:37] that everyone who's judges who's God
[23:42] judges according to their own conditions
[23:45] oh my hmm
[23:53] depending on on what kind of movie
[23:55] you've been watching
[23:59] a boy
[24:01] [Laughter]
[24:06] what series is
[24:10] the year 2023.
[24:16] and truly we're we're not joking it's
[24:18] truly that way
[24:21] one day I was talking to someone
[24:24] an icon in the message
[24:49] let me it sounds like you know let it be
[24:56] okay
[24:58] you understand
[24:59] and I was not talking about that
[25:02] what some are maybe thinking about
[25:09] oh The Beatles yeah and so he was
[25:12] talking about the Beatles
[25:16] and I never told him about I never said
[25:18] anything about it didn't even mention
[25:21] anything to him
[25:22] and maybe it sounds like it
[25:25] I wasn't speaking and talking about that
[25:30] and many of us are that way that we're
[25:33] quick to judge
[25:39] we all have to be filled with God
[25:43] did you hear what brother Brandon said
[25:45] we need to be serious in this hour
[25:50] of course
[25:52] we joke around play around yeah that's
[25:55] no problem
[25:58] as our sister was saying earlier today
[26:03] I saw something more
[26:06] maybe I can't explain
[26:11] speaking of brother Brandon but when he
[26:13] when I saw him doing or those things
[26:15] there was something different there
[26:20] do you believe that that same thing is
[26:22] here
[26:24] the same God
[26:28] that did that with brother Branham he's
[26:31] supposed to do it with each one of us as
[26:34] well
[26:36] he said he said I'm on the platform
[26:41] showing you bride of Christ
[26:44] what you will do
[26:47] you're not going to be William Branham
[26:51] but the same spirit
[26:53] that was in Christ Jesus it's the same
[26:57] spirit
[26:59] in in the unveiling of God do you
[27:02] remember everything that was in God
[27:05] Jesus poured it into Christ everything
[27:08] that was in Christ
[27:09] supported in his church
[27:12] right
[27:15] [Applause]
[27:17] there is coming a day when you recognize
[27:21] that the father is in him
[27:27] and that you are in him that day ask
[27:32] what you will be there
[27:34] and he will do it that is
[27:38] not tomorrow it's today
[28:00] [Music]
[28:40] mismo himself
[28:50] amen
[28:53] so why are we afraid because people are
[28:56] going to criticize
[28:57] they're going to say whatever they want
[29:00] to say but that is his promise the
[29:04] condition
[29:06] that keeps my Commandments
[29:09] that keeps my word
[29:11] and and puts them to work and and
[29:14] keepeth them
[29:15] he is he that loveth me
[29:20] amen amen
[29:22] look what it says okay
[29:27] in John 15 5.
[29:32] we are the branches
[29:38] [Music]
[29:41] the same bringeth forth much fruit
[29:44] for without me
[29:47] you can't do nothing
[29:50] you have to be in the Fountain of Life
[29:55] separated from that Fountain of Life
[29:59] you can fall and believe anything
[30:05] and create more camps than there is
[30:07] already
[30:08] God helps us
[30:12] is to abide
[30:15] in him to abide in him and let's
[30:18] continue
[30:19] and in verse seven
[30:21] if you abide in me he means
[30:26] and my words abide in you
[30:29] I was listening to someone the other day
[30:32] and he said the following
[30:37] he said what we have to do is have a
[30:40] spiritual revelation of the word okay
[30:42] okay and I said yeah okay
[30:45] I said now how is that going to happen
[31:03] God is gonna buy a cloud just descend
[31:07] every single thing in the word you know
[31:08] just writing inside of you they think
[31:11] that they're iPads
[31:13] [Laughter]
[31:16] [Applause]
[31:19] I'm speaking of terminology that some of
[31:22] you young ones understand
[31:26] this is the Apple Country right
[31:32] you you take a picture with an iPhone
[31:34] yes
[31:35] it's on your iPad at the same time
[31:38] technology pretty much technology
[31:43] but you took a picture with your iPhone
[31:48] but you have to take a picture with your
[31:50] own eyes
[31:51] with your own eyes if you can't read
[31:55] it's cucha then listen yeah
[31:58] they have audio Bibles as well
[32:02] there's no excuse to not know the word
[32:06] amen
[32:07] [Applause]
[32:14] and I was I was listening to a
[32:16] missionary some of you may know him
[32:20] you know sometimes when you're preaching
[32:24] and you might say some things about
[32:26] about your life
[32:30] or your testimony of what the word has
[32:32] done in your life
[32:33] but there are some that when they preach
[32:36] this is
[32:41] they say certain things that we know
[32:43] really what's in their head and there's
[32:46] certain brother said yes he's an older
[32:50] man
[32:52] he said I've never read the word of God
[32:55] totally but
[32:56] I believe it's the truth
[32:59] ministro and a minister and a missionary
[33:03] and he's an elder okay what is a
[33:07] missionary
[33:10] someone that just goes and says Jesus
[33:12] saves
[33:18] someone that would put a foundation
[33:21] someone that would go and put things in
[33:25] order
[33:25] and to be able to do that
[33:28] you have to know the words
[33:32] oh what you're speaking about amen
[33:49] Jesus Christ was dressed in that
[33:52] thoughtful Ministry
[33:56] Jesus did not Jesus knew everything
[34:06] I don't know how it works here
[34:10] but the word is the word
[34:13] the word is the word
[34:17] and so I I I came to this message at a
[34:21] very young day
[34:23] and I've met many muchas many preachers
[34:28] many missionaries here from America yes
[34:33] and I have been a witness
[34:36] Hombres of good man is
[34:40] also Batman
[34:43] of good Witnesses of God
[34:46] and then of people that are not even
[34:49] worthy of the Gospel
[35:35] and
[35:39] bring forth fruit
[35:44] one more time like we said this morning
[35:46] gossip is not the fruit foreign
[36:08] witchcraft is not of the Holy Spirit
[36:15] some of them some some look like the The
[36:18] Witch of Endor
[36:22] es
[36:25] and you've read the word
[36:30] speaking of the spirit the king who's
[36:33] she calling the spirit of
[36:38] he said it clearly
[36:41] he can't touch me
[36:44] until I have fulfilled
[36:49] with everything that God called me to do
[36:53] and you had just read it with me
[36:57] Malachi 4 it's been fulfilled it's
[37:00] history
[37:02] Revelations 10 7 it's been fulfilled
[37:04] it's Historia it's history
[37:18] we should be walking on in the celestial
[37:21] things even even now
[37:34] they
[37:42] didn't have good Christians
[37:48] they were they were they were uh uh
[37:51] make-believers
[38:06] react to the word because we are being
[38:08] witnesses that that is true in our lives
[38:12] I was telling someone the other day
[38:20] I said let me let me can you put on one
[38:23] of those football games that you all
[38:25] watch not me I mean I wanted this I
[38:27] wanted to watch what football here you
[38:30] know I said I'm not going to understand
[38:32] nothing
[38:33] they're going to jump here
[38:36] they're gonna someone will get mad over
[38:38] here
[38:39] and I will I will not react to it
[38:43] because I know nothing about football
[38:47] and the people don't react to the word
[38:50] because they don't know it amen it's
[38:53] simply it's simple
[38:57] you don't have to be a genius to know
[38:59] what people what people are like
[39:02] I I I've maybe have said something about
[39:05] the headstones
[39:09] I may have said something about the
[39:12] spirit of God tabernacling in you
[39:15] I may have said something about the
[39:17] pyramid
[39:19] look at the angles here the angle here
[39:22] and there
[39:24] but they don't understand it no gambian
[39:26] they don't change because they don't
[39:28] know they don't know the word of God
[39:40] because then the pastor might get upset
[39:42] if he does in other places and I'm not
[39:45] talking about here
[39:47] [Laughter]
[39:49] no yes
[39:51] I'm a witness that brother Wade he
[39:54] teaches good word
[39:56] you have a good pasture
[39:59] a good creature
[40:07] there's many people that that just shout
[40:09] yeah they do all kinds of things
[40:13] but they don't have a life that backs up
[40:16] that Shout
[40:18] God has blessed you all great amen
[40:21] praise the Lord
[40:24] now I don't say that to get brownie
[40:26] points I just I've seen that amen
[40:32] the People Are People are watching
[40:34] online
[40:38] [Laughter]
[40:41] all right look here this is
[40:49] and I have uh
[40:54] you have not chosen me but I have chosen
[40:57] you and ordained you that you should go
[40:59] and bring forth fruit
[41:04] and that your fruit should remain
[41:08] it has to remain
[41:10] many people live
[41:13] of the experience that they had 20 years
[41:15] ago what about today
[41:19] [Music]
[41:25] every moment
[41:29] or you stopped loving your wife ten
[41:31] years ago you love her every day
[41:35] right
[41:40] so some of you are thinking preparing
[41:44] your muscle your muscle your muzzle
[41:48] they say
[41:51] and that your fruit should remain
[41:54] watch watch what it says
[41:57] that whatsoever
[42:00] he shall ask of the father
[42:04] in my name he may give it to you
[42:09] he may give it you
[42:33] one of the reasons why the Israelite
[42:35] wouldn't call upon the name of the Lord
[42:38] I'm not an expert
[42:41] one of the reasons
[42:44] why they don't name the name of God is
[42:49] because for them just to say the name of
[42:53] God
[42:54] it makes him present
[42:57] it makes him present
[43:12] for them that means death
[43:16] because they're sincere they don't feel
[43:18] prepared
[43:21] but Christians sometimes we take the
[43:24] name of the Lord in vain
[43:27] all right
[43:29] and there there's no fear of the Lord
[43:31] and why is there no fear
[43:35] why is it people don't fear
[43:38] because we have many atheists preaching
[43:42] this message
[43:44] they don't believe in God truly but they
[43:47] but they live by that by God
[43:53] those are the ones that take salaries
[43:56] and things like that the brother Brandon
[43:57] would talk about it
[43:59] they just they work for the meal ticket
[44:01] yeah
[44:18] you can say Well it's
[44:21] that doesn't interest you
[44:23] but for other people in the third world
[44:26] countries it's a lot
[44:29] it means a lot to them yeah
[44:35] many people don't think about inflation
[44:40] [Music]
[44:42] would say that he would take a hundred
[44:44] dollars
[44:45] you remember that
[44:48] okay
[44:50] do you remember
[44:52] if you go back in time
[44:55] and if you look at the inflation
[44:58] and you compare it to the the value of
[45:01] the money today
[45:03] [Music]
[45:07] it's it's money that you can live
[45:09] goodbye
[45:11] we're talking about here in the States
[45:14] but you know here it's this it's the
[45:17] states
[45:23] maybe in that day an automobile cost
[45:25] four hundred dollars but look at
[45:28] inflation now
[45:32] the other day a minister was saying
[45:34] Americano an American brother
[45:37] who doesn't read unless yeah
[45:42] he said he lives like the prophet with
[45:45] like a with a hundred dollars
[45:49] and I said uh
[45:52] and I told him I said you live like that
[45:55] first and then we'll see
[45:59] that they're good to speak or say
[46:01] something something catchy amen
[46:06] and there's people that just don't read
[46:10] it
[46:10] correct I'm saying it politically
[46:13] correct yeah
[46:14] [Laughter]
[46:17] all right let's continue
[46:21] all right I want to quote this because

[49:11] this old book
[49:16] s
[49:21] it's yours
[49:24] you stand with it
[49:28] [Music]
[49:29] don't you compromise on one word
[49:33] you stay right with it
[49:37] you stay right with it
[49:40] honey
[49:42] this is what brother Brandon said right
[49:45] continua let's continue
[49:50] don't you don't care I don't care
[49:53] who's against you
[49:57] okay
[49:59] who's again okay
[50:04] who's again God will be for you
[50:25] on this book
[50:28] and here it says
[50:33] who has been divorced
[50:36] or has had relations with others
[50:44] with another woman
[50:47] [Laughter]
[50:50] pacified woman just not make it sound
[50:52] strange or weird
[50:54] it's
[50:56] 2023 anything goes
[50:59] those are there as well
[51:03] yes
[51:04] yes
[51:10] I have seen those preachers within the
[51:14] message amen
[51:15] and the people back them up
[51:20] but it's not in the word
[51:24] the Bible says curse it be a man who
[51:28] lays with another man
[51:30] I can't compromise on that yeah
[51:34] not even for an offering
[51:43] many ministers even here that that go
[51:47] around preaching and won't say certain
[51:48] things just so they could get that stuff
[51:51] in North America evangelist from here
[51:53] from from North America
[51:56] don't say certain things
[51:59] don't bring judgment in the house of God
[52:03] it's time to to be serious
[52:06] 60 years
[52:09] we're in 2023 and what are we doing God
[52:14] help us
[52:22] you might be saying this Peruvian man
[52:24] preaches very strange
[52:28] foreign
[52:30] I can talk to you about beautiful things
[52:35] and brother Brown said one time
[52:39] you can be healed many times
[52:44] God can work in your life many times by
[52:47] healing
[52:48] but you you might go to hell healed
[52:57] and that's what we have seen
[53:02] it's the truth
[53:07] so look what it says here
[53:11] Contigo God will be for you
[53:15] you preach every word exactly
[53:20] just the way it's wrote in there
[53:23] and the condition
[53:25] e
[53:27] and papa Daddy
[53:30] see you across the river
[53:34] what is the condition brother
[53:40] every words just as it is in the word
[53:44] foreign
[53:51] that's the desire for all of us
[53:55] this book is still is still that is
[53:58] still uh relevant
[54:02] said that it has become a new book to us
[54:06] it was sealed before
[54:09] but the Seven Seals have been loose
[54:13] and we have to see him now
[54:16] in every page of this word
[54:20] and if you don't see him
[54:23] go back and read again because you have
[54:26] to see him
[54:28] every page of the Bible
[54:30] because he was the word
[54:34] when you look at yourself there
[54:37] that day has to come that day has to
[54:41] come
[54:45] Ephesians 4 11 says
[54:52] it's for the perfecting of the Saints
[54:56] perfecting of the Saints
[54:58] not not to retain the Saints
[55:01] not to make them happy all the time not
[55:05] to entertain the Saints
[55:07] or not just to feed the Saints
[55:12] of the Saints
[55:14] amen
[55:16] [Applause]
[55:21] okay
[55:24] there's got to be an Awakening here yeah
[55:28] it's time to get seriously this is
[55:41] we have believed many times that maybe
[55:43] we have it all already
[55:46] because we have all the books
[55:49] we've been baptized in the name of Jesus
[55:51] Christ and that you know that God is
[55:56] serpency divorce marriage and divorce
[56:00] maybe another little thing here and
[56:03] there
[56:07] there are many denominations that
[56:09] believe those same things
[56:13] there is a synagogue
[56:19] where the rabbi is a woman is
[56:22] and they also preach Serpentine
[56:25] see yeah
[56:30] so we don't have it all together
[56:34] the only thing that gives you a shirt is
[56:37] that you have been born again
[56:41] you are born again oh you guys
[56:46] you can see that
[56:50] you you feel that
[56:52] I love the word of God you love God
[56:56] if you love God you love his word
[56:59] amen
[57:01] is
[57:04] we want sometimes our young people to
[57:07] stay in church
[57:09] there's nothing that you can do
[57:12] you have to let God do it
[57:15] when God touches them
[57:17] it's God then
[57:19] who transforms who changes them but
[57:24] remember
[57:25] your children are not going to do what
[57:27] you tell them they're going to do what
[57:30] you do
[57:36] tell them to read the Bible and if you
[57:38] don't read the Bible they're not going
[57:39] to do it
[57:41] leonos
[57:42] you both read together then
[57:46] start reading the word together
[57:50] at the beginning it's difficult yes
[57:54] afterwards it becomes a habit
[57:57] it should be a habit
[58:00] just as you like to go eat tortillas
[58:08] come and read the word together
[58:11] it has to be that way
[58:16] tortillas come from Mexico Cinco de Mayo
[58:19] Cinco de Mayo
[58:21] the 5th of May
[58:23] but this came from heaven
[58:27] and when you're transformed
[58:32] this should not be lacking in your life
[58:36] spread it to you the prophet's own words
[58:39] this old book is
[58:42] still relevant today
[58:44] as it always has been
[58:49] but you might say oh everything that's
[58:51] in there has already been fulfilled
[58:57] you are being you are living prophecy
[59:00] being fulfilled right now
[59:03] and that is there
[59:05] is that is there yes
[59:09] let it not be that we disappear
[59:13] just like the ten tribes of Israel
[59:16] remember there's ten tribes that are now
[59:19] no longer
[59:20] or they killed them all
[59:26] they were absorbed by the culture
[59:30] esparcidos of the cities that they were
[59:32] they were they were
[59:34] separated too
[59:36] serious Babylonians Syria Babylon you
[59:41] know all of that is
[59:43] they were absorbed by that culture of
[59:45] those cities
[59:49] many message churches
[59:52] they are being absorbed by this current
[59:54] culture
[59:57] there are many prideful preachers no
[1:00:00] right oh pride pride preachers not
[1:00:04] prideful Pride the culture of today
[1:00:09] christianos there's some trans
[1:00:11] Christians
[1:00:13] they're Sinners but they say they're
[1:00:15] saved
[1:00:16] adulteros
[1:00:21] adulterers fornicarios fornicators
[1:00:26] it's something that's incredible to me
[1:00:28] God help us
[1:00:32] if someone touches your child
[1:00:37] you won't tolerate it right you love
[1:00:41] your child and if something touches the
[1:00:44] word
[1:00:48] I don't like that
[1:00:50] is I'm not going to tolerate it is I
[1:00:54] won't tolerate it
[1:00:58] there's people that I've had to separate
[1:01:01] from because they don't honor the word
[1:01:03] and it's God it's the word or nothing
[1:01:09] right amen
[1:01:11] we're citizens of the kingdom of God
[1:01:17] when he said you make a bigger circle
[1:01:20] look at this
[1:01:25] just recently I finished preaching a
[1:01:27] series
[1:01:32] when he said don't exclude anyone
[1:01:35] he says the following
[1:01:38] foreign
[1:01:53] not necessarily that he's he's a very
[1:01:56] loving type of person
[1:02:00] we're not talking about that type of
[1:02:02] Personality
[1:02:08] because you know there's there's bad
[1:02:10] people that treat you good so that they
[1:02:12] can rob you later
[1:02:27] that the word of God says
[1:02:31] who has a wife one wife and and children
[1:02:35] Iglesia a good church a good pastor
[1:02:40] where sound Doctrine is preached that's
[1:02:43] what he says and when you elect that
[1:02:47] church
[1:02:48] to go to that church
[1:02:50] where one is
[1:02:53] but he didn't say that all of them
[1:02:57] he said just look for those look for
[1:03:00] those qualities
[1:03:04] and where someone chooses a church with
[1:03:07] those types of conditions
[1:03:10] he said don't exclude them
[1:03:14] Doctrine
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:31] [Music]
[1:03:34] make the circle bigger or don't exclude
[1:03:37] anyone
[1:03:39] he wasn't saying that foreign
[1:04:06] that's only in third world countries
[1:04:09] here
[1:04:16] maybe in Arizona or in Atlanta or
[1:04:19] in in in
[1:04:21] Carolina's in maybe in the Carolinas
[1:04:24] many places
[1:04:27] we have to be careful with them
[1:04:31] so when you read just as it should be
[1:04:34] when you the way you should read
[1:04:38] that's written there
[1:04:43] someone said to me well brother I don't
[1:04:45] read I listen well when you listen
[1:04:48] ing
[1:04:49] you know you have your the tapes
[1:04:52] and you can hear them yourself
[1:04:56] all the tapes that you can
[1:04:58] because at some time at some point when
[1:05:02] you need it
[1:05:03] it's going to come
[1:05:06] it will come
[1:05:08] and that's what we need to do we need to
[1:05:11] be prepared
[1:05:13] so that when Satan comes in on the scene
[1:05:17] you could say it is written
[1:05:24] said so
[1:05:30] you remember that magician there in the
[1:05:32] book of Acts
[1:05:35] in the name of Jesus he went to go cast
[1:05:39] out a demon
[1:05:41] but the one that cast out was him
[1:05:44] himself
[1:05:46] all of that is in the word
[1:05:51] and so we have to pay attention to those
[1:05:53] things
[1:05:54] someone might come yeah
[1:05:56] and maybe my talk about having balance
[1:06:01] but how do I know about balance
[1:06:04] if I don't understand the program
[1:06:08] I have to know this
[1:06:11] to come to a balance
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:19] we need to give emphasis to come back to
[1:06:22] the word come back to the word
[1:06:25] this is the Fountain of Life
[1:06:28] when you come to the world you come to
[1:06:31] God
[1:06:32] when you come to God he manifests
[1:06:35] himself in your life
[1:06:37] simply it's simple one more one more
[1:06:42] one plus one
[1:06:47] plus one all of you will respond the
[1:06:50] same we'll answer the same
[1:06:51] well someone answered differently
[1:06:55] in China One Plus One is two as well
[1:07:01] if you have the Holy Spirit
[1:07:04] you're going to produce the same fruits
[1:07:07] they were produced in Jesus
[1:07:13] Martyrs of the church
[1:07:15] and you're going to keep producing them
[1:07:17] today
[1:07:18] in Sons and Daughters of God
[1:07:21] a simpler manner it's simple no no more
[1:07:24] difficult it seems not difficult it's
[1:07:26] simple
[1:07:28] amen
[1:07:32] you have to think now that less is more
[1:07:35] Simplicity or or let's say the
[1:07:39] Simplicity
[1:07:41] brother Brandon preached the message God
[1:07:44] revealed in simplicity
[1:07:46] the people make them very difficult is
[1:07:49] simply
[1:07:51] but he's simple
[1:07:53] God help us
[1:07:56] okay
[1:08:03] glorious
[1:08:11] glorious
[1:08:22] all right quote number three
[1:08:24] number three
[1:08:27] glorious
[1:08:36] okay right here
[1:08:38] brother Brown says here
[1:08:41] a recording and remember
[1:08:45] I'm on record for this
[1:08:49] and we're Witnesses of that
[1:08:52] in 1963 look what he says here is
[1:08:57] and I remember I'm on record for this
[1:09:03] any promise of God in the Bible
[1:09:09] it's on conditions now
[1:09:12] is
[1:09:17] I don't know what those that are leaving
[1:09:20] the message say that Brandon never
[1:09:21] preached the word we're just saying that
[1:09:23] brother Brandon look what brother Brown
[1:09:25] says
[1:09:27] it's there
[1:09:29] maybe they haven't read themselves
[1:09:36] yeah
[1:09:37] every any promise of God in the Bible
[1:09:40] it's on conditions now
[1:09:44] just because you believe it's there is
[1:09:49] some say I believe it's there
[1:09:55] your Prophet my Prophet says
[1:10:01] that doesn't make it so
[1:10:06] this young man there's a condition there
[1:10:08] bro
[1:10:09] until now we've seen that there's a
[1:10:11] condition it's starting ill it's to be
[1:10:14] in him it's starting in it's to be in
[1:10:16] him
[1:10:18] so that this comes
[1:10:22] speaking of this light so if this turns
[1:10:25] on so for this to turn on it has to be
[1:10:26] connected to the power source
[1:10:35] that will not work
[1:10:38] you have the mechanics that you need
[1:10:41] Dynamics
[1:10:43] right
[1:10:45] and that's what we need to be doing
[1:10:49] God help us brother
[1:10:54] Isaiah 52.
[1:11:00] this Biblical quote is very important
[1:11:04] look what it says here
[1:11:06] locally though they have read
[1:11:10] know that it's speaking about the end
[1:11:12] time
[1:11:14] when brother Branham spoke about Isaiah
[1:11:18] he said Isaiah
[1:11:20] was like a small Bible
[1:11:24] it was like running through the whole
[1:11:26] Bible
[1:11:27] you've read what he said when he said
[1:11:30] that good it's time we went good
[1:11:41] shall know my name
[1:11:51] when you call upon the name of the lord
[1:11:54] it's not only about just saying his name
[1:11:57] is
[1:12:02] remember this is written in a way so
[1:12:04] that you understand the character of
[1:12:06] what is being spoken of in other words
[1:12:10] when you when we when we call upon the
[1:12:13] name of the Lord
[1:12:16] have you read read uh Revelations 13 8.
[1:12:20] you know what I'm about about to say
[1:12:24] Jesus Jesus crucified was crucified
[1:12:29] I'm just paraphrasing
[1:12:32] before the foundation of the world you
[1:12:35] know that yes
[1:12:37] that was an expression
[1:12:40] but the materialization of that foreign
[1:12:59] everything after that is a manifestation
[1:13:02] there is expression of that expression
[1:13:05] Jesus told the Fig Tree remember the fig
[1:13:09] tree that he cursed
[1:13:12] and it wilted it died elentro
[1:13:16] Viola he came back and he saw what had
[1:13:19] happened and he's and he said what he
[1:13:21] said
[1:13:35] look what it says here
[1:13:41] therefore my people shall know my name
[1:13:45] my name
[1:13:47] is
[1:13:52] they'll know what I'm doing at that
[1:13:55] moment
[1:13:59] it's just like God taking a picture with
[1:14:02] you
[1:14:03] a year yesterday Aki here
[1:14:12] you understand
[1:14:15] muchos
[1:14:18] this happened many many years ago before
[1:14:22] the foundation of the world
[1:14:24] in this meeting
[1:14:26] in the mind of God yes and this is now
[1:14:30] the materialization of that what he
[1:14:32] thought of are you understanding
[1:14:35] I didn't know you didn't know the Aussie
[1:14:40] in the name of the Lord are you
[1:14:43] understand
[1:14:44] many people might say
[1:14:47] and the ones that preach false Doctrine
[1:14:54] two or three in the name of the Lord
[1:14:59] and that's the formula for them to start
[1:15:01] something
[1:15:03] um no
[1:15:04] no
[1:15:05] they say the Bible says
[1:15:08] that if two or three are are united in
[1:15:12] my name or gathered in my name or one
[1:15:14] Accord
[1:15:15] remember
[1:15:17] who are they going to be in one Accord
[1:15:19] with
[1:15:20] with the mayor with the president
[1:15:31] with his word
[1:15:36] in that day
[1:15:40] when my word is in you
[1:15:44] you are in me
[1:15:46] ask and I shall give it to you
[1:16:00] the same holy spirit that produced all
[1:16:03] that was produced in the life of brother
[1:16:05] Branham we'll produce it in US
[1:16:10] so we have to start believing that we
[1:16:13] have to start living that is
[1:16:18] North Americans might go to a third
[1:16:20] world country
[1:16:23] is
[1:16:25] and they put this uh very notoriously
[1:16:31] I come from a free country
[1:16:34] I'm a free person
[1:16:39] and you know that there's regimes in
[1:16:42] third world countries
[1:16:44] [Music]
[1:16:46] and they feel that they're restricted
[1:16:48] from their freedom
[1:16:51] you all can walk freely here
[1:16:55] or and you can also Express Yourself
[1:16:57] freely here
[1:16:59] you can buy offender
[1:17:02] now you can say if you say something
[1:17:05] about genders and stuff like that you
[1:17:07] can get into issues
[1:17:09] we're supposed to be the land of the
[1:17:11] free
[1:17:14] San juenta but you see is that is your
[1:17:18] character answers
[1:17:20] that is what you have look at what you
[1:17:24] know that you are
[1:17:27] and why not in Christian in Christianity
[1:17:30] in in God's things
[1:17:33] why don't we act the same we're the sons
[1:17:37] of God
[1:17:39] Satan has no right to to be near me not
[1:17:43] because
[1:17:45] the holy spirit is in me
[1:17:48] or the holy spirit is there is Liberty
[1:18:09] you have to
[1:18:11] come to that point
[1:18:14] amen
[1:18:19] cancers will fall in brother Brown's
[1:18:22] Ministries
[1:18:24] sometimes he didn't even have to pray
[1:18:27] he just simply those things were just
[1:18:30] simply fall
[1:18:31] and Cancers would fall
[1:18:34] because where the spirit of God is
[1:18:41] the spirit of God in your past the
[1:18:47] devil has to flee
[1:18:52] sometimes you might say well I have to
[1:18:54] apply a certain Authority in in in in my
[1:18:57] household for my children
[1:19:01] better just apply the holy spirit in
[1:19:04] your life and you'll see things change
[1:19:05] in your household
[1:19:07] amen
[1:19:09] you create the atmosphere you want to
[1:19:12] have a heaven
[1:19:14] that your home be a heaven come in come
[1:19:17] in
[1:19:18] start acting like a child of God
[1:19:24] through you
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:27] is
[1:19:29] so we have to do that
[1:19:34] what happened
[1:19:36] 60 years have gone by this is
[1:19:42] more than a hundred years has passed
[1:19:45] since Azusa Street
[1:19:47] and what's happening
[1:19:52] we are here in the Bible Belt here in
[1:19:55] America
[1:19:57] and what's happening we're not giving
[1:19:59] forth like
[1:20:01] the the the souls are being lost
[1:20:05] there's corruption
[1:20:09] salt is not activated
[1:20:12] he said we are the salt of the earth
[1:20:16] he never said we are the sugar of the
[1:20:18] earth
[1:20:19] and we have become to be the sugars
[1:20:22] we're just sweet and we're just loving
[1:20:26] but he said we're soft
[1:20:29] and salt prevents corruption
[1:20:32] God help us
[1:20:40] because some might come and they'll show
[1:20:43] you a very loving face
[1:20:45] if you tell them something they don't
[1:20:48] like
[1:20:50] they'll pick you up like that
[1:20:52] from your collar
[1:20:55] America
[1:20:56] two Americans here they did that to me
[1:20:59] yeah
[1:21:05] if I say the name you want to give money
[1:21:06] anymore
[1:21:12] they watch a lot of wrestling
[1:21:15] they're not watching the word of God
[1:21:17] that's not of God
[1:21:20] that's not of God
[1:21:25] God
[1:21:27] is different
[1:21:30] and why did they get upset
[1:21:33] maybe you insulted them no
[1:21:36] or maybe I insulted him now Uno one of
[1:21:39] them
[1:21:41] made an exchange of some of some money
[1:21:46] with a woman
[1:21:48] who was uh not dressed well
[1:22:06] and so he was he was upset
[1:22:11] but he was the one who did that problem
[1:22:14] or made that problem this wasn't me
[1:22:17] yeah oh yeah
[1:22:20] when you're very spiritual mujeres
[1:22:24] even though the woman is not dressed
[1:22:28] properly
[1:22:29] you're looking at the numbers
[1:22:37] see I hope you understand
[1:22:51] they're from our people shall know my
[1:22:53] name
[1:22:56] uh therefore my people shall know my
[1:22:58] name therefore they shall know in that
[1:23:00] day look what it says here
[1:23:07] that I am he that does speak
[1:23:11] behold it is I
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:39] how beautiful upon the mountains
[1:23:47] how beautiful upon the mountains are the
[1:23:49] feet of him that bringeth good tidings
[1:23:53] The Good Tidings the good tidings
[1:23:58] who are they
[1:24:20] the kingdom of God is is within you
[1:24:23] Jesus is it in Jesus
[1:24:27] but more than that El Espiritu Santo the
[1:24:30] holy spirit
[1:24:33] let the Holy Spirit
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:24:39] make that Kingdom or build that Kingdom
[1:24:45] it would be the kingdom of God I said to
[1:24:49] to draw near
[1:24:51] to the people of this world
[1:24:54] the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:24:58] Jesus we have to take the testimony of
[1:25:01] Jesus
[1:25:02] not only just speak of Jesus
[1:25:06] the life there was in Jesus
[1:25:16] someone out there who will have to say
[1:25:18] God sent you it is
[1:25:22] it's just as if God has sent you
[1:25:27] I know it has happened to some of you
[1:25:30] someone might have said to you
[1:25:34] that was for me meaning
[1:25:37] La Paz
[1:25:39] it says here they bring it to Italians
[1:25:41] that publisheth peace
[1:25:45] that bringeth good tidings
[1:25:48] of good that publishes salvation
[1:25:56] for the bride of Christ the prophet said
[1:25:59] so
[1:26:02] thy God reigneth
[1:26:07] one thing is
[1:26:09] the devil also believes in God
[1:26:13] but the other thing is to say that he
[1:26:15] reigns
[1:26:20] he is the Lord of your life of my life
[1:26:27] we are we are we are the Servants of
[1:26:30] Love towards Christ
[1:26:33] when that happens
[1:26:36] when our god reigns
[1:26:38] look what the next verse says
[1:26:42] thy Watchmen
[1:26:45] shall lift up the voice
[1:26:48] with the voice together shall they sing
[1:27:02] [Music]
[1:27:33] but we all have to come to the same
[1:27:35] thing remember
[1:27:40] this is the same stature of Christ
[1:27:48] those that have fallen back
[1:27:52] many people looked at him like that
[1:27:55] and they loved going there
[1:27:59] and I've received testimonies
[1:28:02] I would say there was no meetings like
[1:28:04] those meetings oh he was a good man
[1:28:08] and he would treat you so good
[1:28:11] Grande such a great man they put him at
[1:28:15] a pedestal
[1:28:17] I and then he comes out
[1:28:20] leaves the message
[1:28:23] and you would say I've never learned
[1:28:26] anything
[1:28:27] and you had them up in the pedestal
[1:28:33] when he spoke it sounded he sounded like
[1:28:35] he was just super anointed
[1:28:43] they started putting his his sermons
[1:28:46] online yeah
[1:28:47] you started speaking many elevated
[1:28:50] things
[1:28:53] but nobody's supposed to look to see if
[1:28:57] he was saying what the prophet was
[1:28:58] saying and that was what the problem was
[1:29:02] that was the problem
[1:29:04] as if we problem that was the issue
[1:29:08] but when God is on the scene look what
[1:29:11] it says one more that one more time that
[1:29:15] part
[1:29:17] Watchman shall lift up the voice with
[1:29:20] the voice together
[1:29:23] foreign
[1:29:33] for they shall see eye to eye when the
[1:29:36] Lord shall bring again Zion
[1:29:42] there won't be any difference I can see
[1:29:44] myself the same way
[1:29:46] and know that he's here
[1:29:49] know that it's the same word
[1:29:51] now that he's greater or that I'm
[1:29:55] greater
[1:29:57] we're at the same level
[1:30:00] same word
[1:30:02] the same word
[1:30:04] because this is the same measure
[1:30:07] we all have to come to that God help us
[1:30:13] let's read one more quote so we can
[1:30:16] finish up
[1:30:18] is that the message is I was with Moses
[1:30:22] so I will be with thee is
[1:30:26] I'll be with you even in you today end
[1:30:30] of the way
[1:30:31] each minister is
[1:30:34] called to stand where he did
[1:30:38] each minister is
[1:30:42] called to stand where he did
[1:30:45] where was he
[1:30:48] the same works that I do
[1:30:51] shall you do also
[1:30:54] each minister is
[1:30:56] ordained of God is
[1:31:00] commanded to stand in the tracks of
[1:31:02] Jesus Christ
[1:31:05] and perform the duties that Jesus
[1:31:08] performed
[1:31:34] it should be in US
[1:31:37] I don't know
[1:31:39] isn't that what he's saying there is
[1:31:43] that is
[1:31:46] that's quite a command
[1:31:49] it's an order it's not a suggestion it's
[1:31:54] a command
[1:32:01] it's what we're supposed to do
[1:32:05] sonidos no that's only the greater ones
[1:32:08] in the of the in the U.S
[1:32:11] every minister
[1:32:14] every minister
[1:32:19] Jesus The Works that Christ did
[1:32:24] not that they go imitating the way uh
[1:32:28] the the greater ones
[1:32:31] if he turns here
[1:32:37] and I'll see who are they imitating
[1:32:41] I look over there
[1:32:58] imitating the same person
[1:33:01] and you can see it
[1:33:05] I have no idea to know I've I've seen it
[1:33:08] I I know you have to
[1:33:10] yeah but you have to imitate the Lord
[1:33:14] the Lord
[1:33:16] Paul said uh imitate me no follow me no
[1:33:22] not him not him
[1:33:24] follow me in the way that is I follow
[1:33:28] Christ
[1:33:31] or to do the same works
[1:33:38] but they're imitating each other
[1:33:40] nowadays
[1:33:48] but the thing of it is they forget who
[1:33:51] they are
[1:33:52] that's very important
[1:33:55] we need to know who we are
[1:33:58] when you know who you are
[1:34:01] he said it is
[1:34:05] when when the day that when the church
[1:34:08] realizes who she is
[1:34:12] it will be an invincible Army that's
[1:34:16] what he says in the church age book
[1:34:32] that's
[1:34:34] the condition
[1:34:36] being born again
[1:34:39] born again
[1:34:42] not in fornication
[1:34:45] not in adultery
[1:34:47] not in being a feminate
[1:34:51] yes a
[1:34:56] that's what the prophet said he called
[1:34:58] it
[1:35:02] and he said some other strong things as
[1:35:04] well
[1:35:08] there are some that would get offended
[1:35:11] when you repeat the same things that the
[1:35:12] prophet said
[1:35:15] In the Heat of that message he said
[1:35:19] there's no other better way to say that
[1:35:23] and it was the truth
[1:35:26] it was truth
[1:35:28] taught
[1:35:54] why are we afraid of that yeah
[1:35:58] oh they're gonna they're gonna call us
[1:36:00] out
[1:36:02] it's biblical it's biblical
[1:36:06] you just now saw it in Isaiah
[1:36:10] we're gonna see eye to eye
[1:36:13] to eye and we're going to say
[1:36:17] look what it said
[1:36:24] for they shall see eye to eye
[1:36:26] when the Lord shall bring again Zion
[1:36:32] he didn't say that they're going to go
[1:36:33] see over there in that corner yeah or
[1:36:36] over there in that place
[1:36:41] I have to see the Lord
[1:36:44] he has to see the Lord
[1:36:46] I have to see the Lord that way
[1:36:58] or
[1:37:00] from Korea China or from China uh Japan
[1:37:04] Japan
[1:37:05] no no
[1:37:10] that has this has nothing to do with our
[1:37:12] skin color
[1:37:15] is
[1:37:17] Jesus I said what color was Jesus's skin
[1:37:21] Olive
[1:37:25] has nothing to do with the skin color
[1:37:29] is the holy spirit it's the spirit of
[1:37:32] God
[1:37:33] producing the same works
[1:37:36] the exact same thing that Jesus did
[1:37:39] that's what makes it so equal with Jesus
[1:37:42] Christ
[1:37:45] in his presence yeah and supresencia oh
[1:37:49] my yeah oh my
[1:37:54] makes the devil angry
[1:37:58] but I mean
[1:38:01] devils are angry right now
[1:38:09] brother brother Dale why did you invite
[1:38:11] that man
[1:38:19] just let him loose somewhere on the side
[1:38:22] of the road
[1:38:26] there's people that get angry
[1:38:28] there's people that don't like it
[1:38:32] that you know what's happening in in
[1:38:35] America or down in South America or
[1:38:37] wherever
[1:38:45] to service
[1:38:47] you know
[1:38:49] I was going to say the name but better
[1:38:51] now
[1:38:54] one time someone gave another Minister a
[1:38:57] thousand dollars
[1:38:59] so that they could send us some Bibles
[1:39:03] and you know what Bibles they sent us
[1:39:06] the ones that uh that that they give out
[1:39:10] here
[1:39:11] and there's ones that they give out here
[1:39:15] free for free the free ones and that's
[1:39:19] the ones that they sent us
[1:39:22] that's the ones that they sent us
[1:39:29] we could have we could have bought them
[1:39:31] there but
[1:39:33] they stayed well we'll just send them
[1:39:35] from here and they're good quality
[1:39:38] Americano American
[1:39:42] but they sent us the ones that they give
[1:39:44] out freely here
[1:39:46] this house you see
[1:39:48] and to me that's shameful
[1:39:54] foreign
[1:40:14] but sometimes people are very tight on
[1:40:17] their money
[1:40:19] God help us
[1:40:24] look what it says here is
[1:40:31] he says oh that's what makes the devil
[1:40:33] angry foreign
[1:40:40] who they are
[1:40:43] that's it Gloria glory to God
[1:40:50] and in the message this day the
[1:40:52] scripture is fulfilled and he said

[1:41:31] that in the seventh Angel's message
[1:41:35] these things should come to pass
[1:41:39] this is in 1965.
[1:41:43] this day
[1:41:46] this scripture

[1:42:15] things
[1:42:17] Eternal things
[1:42:20] it's time to make a line
[1:42:24] just as in the days of Moses

[1:45:27] listen to your mother
[1:45:30] go and see the doctor
[1:45:33] I went to the clinic
[1:45:37] and they didn't let me come out
[1:45:40] because when you have sepsis
[1:45:43] and if they don't treat you
[1:45:46] you could sue them
[1:45:49] and so they told me you either stay
[1:45:52] by your own will
[1:45:54] or we're just gonna subject you to the
[1:45:57] bed
[1:45:58] tie you up
[1:46:02] they had to they had to give me
[1:46:04] antibiotics
[1:46:06] for five days
[1:46:09] five days
[1:46:11] and I don't like needles
[1:46:17] and so last year in order for me to come
[1:46:21] to the states
[1:46:25] one of the things for you to enter the
[1:46:27] US
[1:46:29] you had to have four vaccines
[1:46:38] I
[1:46:40] said Lord help me
[1:46:43] four
[1:46:47] hey
[1:46:51] so they had me in the hospital five days
[1:46:54] with all kinds of needles in me
[1:46:58] you know the devil always tries to
[1:47:01] embarrass the children of God
[1:47:10] sometimes those things uh if it gets too
[1:47:13] out of hand it starts poisoning your
[1:47:15] body
[1:47:22] God is on time
[1:47:24] he can never fail
[1:47:26] amen
[1:47:28] since January
[1:47:32] you know we've prayed we've we've read
[1:47:34] the word
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:37] you know we've been in communion with
[1:47:39] God
[1:47:43] and things are different now in the
[1:47:45] congregation and they're in our church
[1:47:48] and believe me
[1:47:50] has worked in such a way
[1:47:54] we pray for the sick always and God
[1:47:58] heals them
[1:48:03] when I prayed for other people I've seen
[1:48:05] cancers healed
[1:48:08] and impossible things being here being
[1:48:12] them being healed of impossible things
[1:48:15] the same God that's working there in
[1:48:18] Peru is working here
[1:48:19] because the Bible says
[1:48:22] the prophet has taught us
[1:49:11] that it would not be 24 hours until
[1:49:15] after he had died
[1:49:19] for every everyone to start corrupting
[1:49:22] the message
[1:49:58] [Music]
[1:50:03] he's still here
[1:50:06] the only thing that you can lose is the
[1:50:09] opportunity

[1:51:06] where his word is at

[1:51:47] we have we have failed to see that that
[1:51:50] can happen in our lives
[1:51:53] loving God allow us to be
[1:51:57] quieres the one that what you want us to
[1:52:01] be
[1:52:05] manifestation
[1:52:06] Paul said that the Earth is traveling to
[1:52:09] for the manifestation of the Sons and
[1:52:11] Daughters of God Lord
[1:52:18] in our very own lives
[1:52:26] that even our neighbors can see
[1:52:31] that even the authorities here in this
[1:52:34] area
[1:52:35] is
[1:52:37] happening in this congregation
[1:52:41] they could fear the lord in such a way
[1:52:47] be the light of the world
