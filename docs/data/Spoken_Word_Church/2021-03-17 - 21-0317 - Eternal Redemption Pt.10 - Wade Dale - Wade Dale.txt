still haven't found that hour sleep back yet i don't know about y'all but uh kind of rough but i hope they pass legislation that they're supposed to pass that we don't have to change that clock anymore that would be in the state of georgia though if you go somewhere else you may have to so but uh good to be here tonight good to have you here with us uh brother anderson has to work he's doing some work so that's why he's not here brother bob also is having a problem at work so he's there trying to take care of that and i don't see louise and christine i think luis was out a day or so sick from work brother joe said so let's just remember them in prayer also remember let's pray that this bad weather just gets on out of here because it's it was showing back there a few minutes ago that uh some tornadoes really tore up mississippi and coming to alabama so and heading our way so we know uh we know the maker we know the master of the wind so we need to uh pray before we go to bed this thing will get out of the way also by way of announcement brother trevor emonds will be here with us sunday to preach both services uh be good to see him again i hadn't seen him for a little while he came by here a few years ago um just remember him also brother rush dunker will be here the middle of the week next week and uh to fellowship with us the brother from minnesota and then i'll be speaking next wednesday also all right so still remember june the 17th the father's day annual fishing trip also remember that coming up on this easter is coming up in a few weeks and uh june and i will be in arizona for about a week to speak for brother chris long so just remember that in your prayers we had a good time in kentucky everybody said to me hello and uh we had a real good time stayed an extra day and had some real good fellowship so uh thank you for all your prayers we didn't have any trouble getting up there and didn't have any trouble getting back so really enjoyed that so let's turn our bibles to hebrews nine and continue on eternal redemption part 10. we were we were in kentucky i spoke on this same subject but kind of got into um predestination and foreign and there was really some good things brought out uh you know when you when you go somewhere as a preacher and they say you know good job and then they all just disperse and go in their white merry ways you know it's well we had a good time and see you later but uh we had time to fellowship and and one brother said i've never heard that preach as plain as you preached it was predestination he said he said people have made it so mysterious and so strange well pop knows that you know they make it so mysterious so strange that you can't understand it but if you'll just take it simply by the way we that we're preaching it here and brother dale's preaching it's just so simple that by four knowledge he knew everything that that's pretty much yeah by for knowledge you knew everything so then he could pre-determine what's going on by your desire he desired that all of us be saved he desired all of us to be up the statue of perfect man he desired everybody to be a christian but not everybody's going to because we're a free moral agent there's louise and christine so he's better there they are right there thank you lord for bringing them in so hebrews 9 verse 11 and let's pray before we get started the heavenly father thank you for the day that you give us this hour that we're living in that we can understand you that we can lord you said by understand the mystery of this end time lord that all that will be made known to your people father we thank you for the word that we hear here father and we thank you for all the ministry here lord that speaks in this pulpit and around the world lord the true ministry the true bride of jesus christ we thank you for each one lord we pray that you'd heal the sick lord the ones among us that are not feeling well some have work to do father we know that that gets in the way sometimes the lord we know that you're the only one that can satisfy man has tried to satisfy this world from trying to make money and by this and by that but there's only one satisfaction that's in jesus christ and that's you lord the word so forgive us of our sins bless this day keep us and lead us and guide us by your holy spirit be us lord tonight with the storm coming in bad weather man says it's coming but lord we can say no that that thing can turn and go another direction and not come by here lord and cause any damage we pray for the ones that's already had damage there in mississippi and in alabama lord we pray that you'd touch each one they're we're human beings lord and we're at the mercy of this thing for our time being but lord you told us when we come up that statue of perfect man that we would come into speaking condition and we could lord do the things we need to do lord to get through and get by father just be with us fill us with your holy spirit give us revelation you do the speaking tonight father in jesus name we pray amen and also remember brother aaron too he's he's not sick sick but he's he hadn't he had a test and hadn't got it back yet so that's why he's not here tonight he's just kind of self-quarantining for a few days and uh and if he got his test results back and it had been negatory he'd be up here tonight all right so hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us i hope that sinks in having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated in the lord's blessing to the reading of the word and we're going to read this quote again i know sometimes you know i was telling you brother claude now we're talking it takes takes 12 to 15 times for humans to read something to get comprehended so this is the plan part 10. so we're getting close to number 12. okay but redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible actually i don't want to add to what brother brown said it's the only thing that's in the bible redemption is coming from as far when we go to uh there had to be a covering before adam even came on the earth because what god by foreknowledge knew adam would fall god by foreign knowledge knew eve would fall god by foreign knew they would need a sacrifice before they even hit the earth so he had it there waiting on them and to me that's grace grace amazing grace that covered them for the sin that they did because it turned the whole world upside down and put us in chaos but yet god was right there and we'll see adam and eve one day and you know what i'm not going to go up to adam and eve and say why'd you do what you did no we're just going to rejoice and be happy that we made it amen so it's one of the oldest things in the bible did you know redemption was even the plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed you know we've been talking about this this think of this god foreseeing and making a way of redemption before he even made the world now what happens is i was thinking yesterday we say god had a plan and god had a purpose that's good but who is it for and who is he going to use to get this plan going and get this plan in motion he's going to use human beings he's going to allow or let man fall so that his attributes can be made manifest that was his plan because for seeing he could see and then his dad and i were kind of briefly last night talking that there is a predetermined destiny for certain things and he's been covering that he covered it sunday there's a there's going to have to be a fivefold ministry it doesn't name every prophet pastor teacher evangelist but it says you must have apostles prophet pastor's eastern evangelist to perfect the saints so that is a predetermined preset there had to be seven church age messengers there had to be an update of pentecost there had to be jesus physically dying on those things had to happen that was predetermined and cannot change what you and i have to do is you and i have to connect ourselves to that see that's our choice here it is moses told the children of israel he said this day choose you this day who you will serve and they had to make a choice because they had this list of things that if they did this is what god was going to bless them and then there was a list in deuteronomy of the things that if they didn't do it they were going to get this curse amen so it was laid out pretty well for them because you and i though we see by the baptism of the holy ghost that we don't do away with the ten commandments we don't do away with all the things that happen in the old testament but they have to be used as tights because listen we we're surely not going god's not going to make us go out and marry a prostitute but he used that as an example in the old testament under the blood of bulls and ghosts i want you to remember something because this plan of redemption actually contains the blood of bulls and goats because without that gap in between there they would have just been lost there would have been nobody saved that's what we were talking about this weekend and and like my brother richard hyatt he was we were talking about uh nobody being saved or having the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth in the old testament he agreed and he liked the way that we brought it out because they had the holy ghost now listen you can't reject that john the bible says john had the holy ghost but it never said john had the new birth you said that's the same no they're not right you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every day of your life on your spirit and die and go to hell but you can never have the new birth and die and go to hell if you have the new birth you don't you got free ticket to glory but you can have the holy ghost you can have pete and ice was anointed by the holy ghost balaam was anointed by the holy ghost amen there was a donkey anointed by the holy ghost one time amen but now in the end well that's not going to happen now because god has honed it down to me and you jesus came to not save the donkey he came to save the human right and then he would take his holy ghost and put it into that human and i was reading back here a few minutes ago brother madam was talking about you know he says i don't believe in transmigration or or all these different things of of the soul and then he talks about soul sleeping and we may get to that if we don't we'll get to it next wednesday where you're a smith believed that you know when you died you stayed there in the ground you that's where you lay that's what they call it soul sleeping when you die that's where you lay you're there your soul your consciousness and everything is in that is in the grave no no that's not true we know that that's why i'm covering these dimensions because god had to set these dimensions up before the foundation of the world now they were empty some of them but they were empty at a time but as soon as abel died and as soon as cain died and as soon as all these people started dying god had to have a place to set each and every one of them because he didn't he has never ever ever since he created a soul he has never to this day destroyed one never to this day you heard what i said never to this day as he destroyed a soul he has put that soul somewhere so that's how much he thinks of that soul like we were talking about and saw where brother brown said now hell's not burning because they've not been judged yet you say well now look with me and you when me and you look at that we say yeah i think they've already been judged but you and i we were talking about this weekend you never know when somebody's right on their deathbed and they say god forgive me you're not if you're not there you don't know so i like what brother richard high said he said let god judge him you quit judging him he said just forget it what are you gonna what are you gonna do you can't bring them back we will read here in a minute where where even the rich young ruler asked abraham he said can i get back and tell my brothers to not come to this place and basically abraham said even though they get you ra we could raise you god could raise you from the dead they're not going to believe it anyway because they didn't believe it to start with god's already sent him a provision he already sent him the bosom of abraham he already sent them prophets and look at what the rich young ruler he turned jesus christ down himself okay and he was sent to hell where he's still waiting right now and that's the whole thing wherever they are they've been there for a while they can't pass through something they can't migrate over here they can't get better once they leave no this is your time i was thinking the other day and whether we get to this or not i'm going to bring this point out but look god is standing back and looking and we see people that are that doesn't make it to the age of accountability god knew that he knew the heart of that person so he could put and thank god he sent us a prophet to say all babies go to heaven because they can't be judged because there's nothing to judge him for because jesus christ is the one that is the righteous judge and all he's going to do he's going to say hey they didn't make it to the to the age of accountability they didn't know any better how many how many billions of babies have been born in this world that's going to heaven because they died before i was just reading in joshua this morning in my scripture reading where joshua went into one of those cities and and killed everything that had breath it said so it had to be women children men and god told him to do that okay see that's hard for us to to realize that god told him to do that but that was under the blood of bulls and goats and that was the thing that he told joshua what to do his commission was was to drive all the people out well he he didn't want some of them driven out he wants some of them done away with amen but you see all baby how many countless babies has been since then though that is that have died that are going to be there somewhere now look at what happened to sharon rose and that's one thing you look at when when the brother branham walks by in that vision he sees that grown woman so you see sharon rose died as what six-month-old baby but when she went across the curtain of time she wasn't a six-month-old baby she was an 18 year old girl see that was already fixed in god's mind he predetermined that but he saw that she would pass away he saw that the prophet would do what he did he saw that sharon rose would pass away and he had a provision waiting for her see sometimes we so narrowly think that well we're the only people in the world i was thinking yesterday when i was reading or this morning when i was reading the book of joshua it's told of all those different cities that had hundreds of thousands of people sometimes we just hone in and say what nothing but the jews in the old testament the children of israel now this world was being populated and they were moving and they were they were building kingdoms and they were setting up things but israel was his chosen and he told israel he said wherever you put the soul joshua wherever you go i'm going to bless you and then you place the people in that promised land but he had there had to be a slaughter there has to be a slaughter for us to go up the statue of a perfect man there has to isn't a bloody affair i told a church there the other night i said look it's real strange that the prince of peace stood one day and said i didn't come to bring peace i came to bring a sword i came to bring a division the prince of peace said that it's hard for us to believe but once you get the baptism of the holy ghost you'll believe it and you'll know that that's what's happening is that you and i what we're fighting our way to heaven amen it's not a picnic it's a battle amen titus 1 verse 1 that he promised this eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began paul is very clear here but half in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our savior as i said before you might get born again by pressing play but you will not become a full-grown christian by just listening to tapes because that's what the bible tells us that the perfecting of the saints is under a five-fold predestinated ministry that has to happen it's got to happen you know why it's got to happen you see there you see why that has to happen because he knew you needed it he knew i had to sit under a ministry i was thinking yesterday and i i just want to make this statement you know i get in trouble for making statements anyway so i'm going to make it i see all the people we were talking this weekend about all the people fell away from the message and i just want to make this statement you know you you look at some of the people and i don't call names because everybody knows who's left the message we ain't gotta you gotta post it but look what they had great anointings they could preach like a house on fire on a windy day they could run the islands they had people running the aisles they had congregations running the aisles they had them shouting and screaming and speaking in tongues and they're living in adultery denying the message so what's that got us it takes a five-fold ministry people can't sit and listen to a pastor they want to go to this one and go to that one they want church hop and go to this and go to this one nobody ever wants to hear a teacher because they're boring but i thought you know when jesus during his whole life during his whole life i don't think he ever raised his voice much except when he was at the tomb of lazarus he cried with a loud voice and said lives was come forth but every time he dealt with a demon he was as calm as a cucumber you know why because he had control he knew he had virtue or strength and brother brown the same way how many times have you ever heard him raise his voice in a prayer line ever no i've never heard him raise his voice in a prayer line he talks so that's what the problem is have we shouted this thing out you know we just shouted all all we're doing is just shouting and screaming and speaking in tongues and hey that's okay that's good but when you come down here and you go out monday what have you heard on sunday that you felt good and it was all good and this was great and i had cause i and you know what sunday afternoon after we finished the service we sang for what jim another 20 minutes after i preached or even 30 minutes because the spirit of the lord was in the building nobody was shouting but you could just see people weeping and they were just so calmly just praising the lord and we just never couldn't stop the service and afterwards and and you know me i wasn't running the aisles i mean i slammed my fist down every once in a while just to get them awake like y'all are asleep now but um i'll go get some toothpicks or something put them in your ear or stick a toothpick somewhere else stay awake but uh i told them i said you know that's that's the way it ought to be i said oh it ought to be you ought to bring the word of god and then if that spirit falls speaking in tongues shouting that's okay but what about just a calm spirit that comes over the building and people just kind of you know they just praise the lord amen for about 30 minutes couldn't stop the service brother richard just kept saying he said hey this is feeling good up here so we you understand what i mean and i'm not saying anything against that we got to have it but there's five parts to it everybody loves an evangelist and that's okay because an evangelist is all up you know and that's okay but you know what he's got to leave but the pastor and the teacher and the different ones and the prophets and the apostles they have to live with the people they have to live with the problems and the issues and all the things that go on and what are we doing with it are we as brother brown said one time tooting it out to whistle we've been around 60 years and what has that got us because i believe the words that when we come to the end time standing on the word 100 is going to get you further than you're shouting and speaking in tongues and all those different things because the devil can impersonate everything but the revealing of the word he cannot replace oh yeah he can try but he can never that's why that brother else just we were coming down the road coming down the road monday and june and i were you know how you get aggravated when something starts buffering right you're getting this we were in the car coming down the road and we weren't getting good cell service and dad would speak about four sentences and then it would start buffering well june and i looked at each other and i said that bother you and she said no not really i said me either i said it gives me time to think in between the four sentences he said and then there's about a minute in there that it's buffering and i'm trying to say i'm thinking what he said so that that worked out pretty good so from now what we're going to do is we're going to speak four sentences no kidding we'll be here six hours but i'll guarantee you'll get more than you get now but that's just the way we are as humans though because you only process so much we know that and we can only endure so much and i know that but it's the word bottom line it's the revealing of the word that's predestinated somebody will come to it because there will be a perfecting of the saints and somebody see then what you got to do though is you got to connect yourself to that right this is the eternal part this is the predestinated part but you got to connect yourself to it because you're going to make a choice amen so now let's read ephesians 1 and let's start with verse 3. blessed be the god and father my lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings and heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world how many times has brother dale and i've been telling you we don't want to be chosen by him because everybody was chosen by god he knew every person would be on this earth he knew what adolf hitler would do when he got here and all the different ones so they were they were chosen they were men you're called if you were chosen we understand that but that before the foundation of the world look though but look at this one group of people that we should be holy and without blame so that does away with a lot of people right i dazzle away with a lot of spirits and a lot of denominational ideas and that does away a lot of our ideas but see it says that we should be holy and without blame before him in love if you have the baptism of holy ghost today you are blameless and you are the holy righteous bride of jesus christ now that's what he sees now the devil don't see that but look having predestinated us into adoption so see there's another thing adoption is not a maybe we might there might be a group get to it no that's what struck me coming down the road having predestined now see that is a predetermined destiny now we know it's all about foreknowledge but still there's things that are set in stone there's going to be an adopted group of people because peter said add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge temperament temperature patience patience godliness godliness brother kindness and love and then it took a prophet of god to put all this together to tell us that you and i needed to go up a statue of a perfect man that you and i needed to go up this stature of a perfect man in the end time so there is a predestination when brother branham was sitting in the woods and he started drawing remember he come the lord came to him and he made all the drawings and preached the stature of a perfect man he said he'd never seen it like that before and what a revelation well that was a predestinated time that god knew that that prophet would be there he knew he would have a mouthpiece so he brought the word to the mouthpiece now listen he didn't bring that he didn't bring that to brother brown in 1957. he didn't bring that to brother roman in 1947. he didn't bring that to him in about 1959 he brought it to him when brother branham could preach it to us that he had went up that statue of a perfect man and god had given those gifts to him to bring it to me in you and to bring it to me and you was that was his job his j listen his job was not for him to just go up that that's your perfect man his job was not just for god to perfect him his job was not that god was going to bring him back to perfect us he's not going to bring brother brown back to perfect us he gave us a predestinated plan that did not include a prophet coming back into this dimension show me one show me one you say oh no no no samuel no wait a minute that's old testament you can't bring up souls from the sixth dimension now you can't do that they're there listen they don't want to come back here yet right they don't death is still raining here death doesn't rain over there brother brown said have i got to go back that was his whole thing that thing's laying down there i know it he you know what he had his faculty he knew if he got back in that body he was gonna die so he said can i stay here no you gotta go back it's not your time yet having predestinated us into adoption so everybody that's born again according to romans 8 we all receive the spirit of adoption when we get born again where we cry abba father or daddy daddy what you cry because you're a baby but now as we grow up in the statue of a perfect man we should not be crying anymore we should not be having a toll to go to church or told to get here on time or total you know do the things we're supposed to do it should be automatic there's a lot of things that the world does that they do it so many times that it's just repetition until it just becomes second nature so what's our problem what's our problem as christians i mean i know when i get up tomorrow morning i know that i got 380 mailboxes they don't move people do sometime but i know almost brother donny i can close my eyes and almost now i can throw them in the slot that need to go in well now if you can do that because of repetition then why can't you do the same thing or repetition of the gospel why can't you do where you can where you can open and you don't have to be able to quote every scripture but you know what if you start talking about the lord and the scripture pops in your mind it's in that bible somewhere it didn't just come from over here in greer's almanac it came from the bible but you know what if you never read the bible prime example june's dad good man good man walking shoe leather wonderful man but he's never read the bible he said oh he might have read it a long time ago so how can i talk to him i was talking to him about the bible he didn't know anything about the bible he just knows that there was a jesus and there he came and died and and all the different things and the moses and all the little stories that was told why it's not repetition because he's not opened the book he's not read the prescribed reading because listen this was predestinated before the foundation of the world written because of foreknowledge though but he wrote this and guess what when he sent it down to us it's so sure it never changes will never change well is what we're talking about brother richard now we this thing's this thing's just gonna this is just this is so limited but when we get to glory this is not gonna this is going to go away you're not going to see bibles oh yeah you might see them as a testimony or as a memorial but what are you going to see you're going to see us living epistles that's what god listen from the beginning if there had not been a fall there wouldn't have been a bible but there was and we need one there was a fall and we need a bible we need a guideline we need a guidepost we need these things to tell us what to do and let's not do them begrudgingly but do them for the glory of the lord have you even predestinated us into the adoption of children verse five we're not going to get anywhere tonight but that's okay we'll get as far as we can to stop according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace where he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have what redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has to bound it toward us in all wisdom and prudence now watch having made known unto us the mystery of his will there's the key now this plan is not so mysterious that we can't understand it if it was he's not a righteous judge and he's not a good daddy why would i want to give josh this mysterious book to get to this place and and say man you just got to figure it out no give him the give him the book that's what we were given now what what man has done to it has made it mysterious but having made known unto us the mystery of his will so there's a there's for that fivefold ministry that's where that predestinated it's going to come right you got to decide whether you want to hear it or not you got to decide whether you want to sit here you got to decide whether you want to listen to this or listen to that that's your choice having made known unto us the mystery of his will not our will his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself look that in the dispensation of the fullness of times which is now he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance look being predestinated according to what being predestinated according to the purpose the plan and purpose was to have children that were going to have a no spot no wrinkle they were going to be his children and his wife not so much the church because it took a profit to tell us one day that this is talking about the church and this is what they get and this is talking about the bride and this is what she gets now sometimes it overlaps but when you come down to wife and church two different things way too different things because remember the church has their self out the bride of jesus christ is virgin stays virgin will be virgin all the way through amen that's why brother brown god won't touch brother brown said i know why i hate that organization i hate that denomination why it's a prostitute spirit it's the spirit of prostitution in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will says we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are be called thee called not a call be called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed what he predestinated somebody to be conformed to the image of his son there he did predetermine there was going to be he was going to die for the world and then someone is going to have to accept that right because there's no other way and that's the predestinated part and he also did predestinate he also did predestinate what to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate are predetermined then he also called whom he called he justified and whom he justified then he also glorified then the rest of the scripture says so what can we say if god be for us who can be who can be against us they ma'am so look and the brother of him says the word predestinate that's not a good word to use i know we're hammering this but if you'll ever get for knowledge and predestination you'll understand as we were talking about sunday you'll understand what brother brown says you always were eternal because there was i i had pulled some quotes for brother brown so you always were weak now wait a minute i'm fixing to read you one right there number three says how can i take a cuckoo bird and make a grain of wheat out of it that was my question to those in in kentucky but you can give me any quote in almost by by knowledge i can find you one real quick that sounds contrary brother brown comes up one day and says let's stand up and address the third person of the trinity well he wasn't addressing his third person he was addressing their third person because he only had one person but he was talking to a group of people mixed multitude so he had to say those things sometimes and then he would come in and he would look like paul right there in ephesus now the ephesians could swallow what i was just reading to you to a degree but he didn't say that to the corinthians because they were messed up but the ephesians had done what they had grown in grace and knowledge they had grown under paul so paul could tell them according you have chosen us in him before the foundational world having predestinated us into adoption of children they understood what he said when we see that in in some of the terms of what comes in the message is it's just predetermined it doesn't matter what i do i always was wheat well read the next one think number three please how can i take a huckleberry and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it see he's explaining that brother ryan's explaining it's impossible for him to do that it's impossible for me to go out and plant my taters the other day that's t-a-t-e-r-s for those of you don't understand to others that's potators but i went out and planted my taters the other day now i'm not expecting for okra to come up because i planted taters right but now if god by transforming power that he has and nobody else does if he wanted to make it an okra he could do it just like me and you but we must yield ourself the only way it can be is because inside the kookaburra has been transmitted so in other words it had to come from somewhere when you transmit when you transmit a radio signal you have to have a base and you have to have a receiver right if you don't have a base the receiver is not going to get it and if you if you just have a base with no receiver nobody's going to get it so you have to have both you have to have the foreknowledge and the pre-determining but the foreknowledge first from the base and then by four knowledge i can pick up that this cup i was a cuckolar i'm still a cuckolder on the outside but on the inside there's been a transformation or not a soul transfer he didn't he didn't just move the cuckoo bear over and put the weed in he took the life has been transmitted from a cuckoo bird wheat now listen what he says a cuckoo bird to a germ called wheat life then you bury that kuckerberg and it'll produce a grain of wheat now only god can do that same way with me and you because there has been a life a life of wheat put in that cuckoo bird because there has been a life of wheat put in the cucumber not just realize you always were wheat but now look see where you got it you got to take the other quote though where brother brown said you always were eternal you always were wheat in the mind of god when he said let's go back in the back part of god's mind that is a whole different ballgame than being here on the earth if i may use that word ball game but it's a whole different thing because in the mind of god we are all eternal that genesis 1 26 man never fail never never fail you did but it didn't so that was always was a germ of wheat but it was transmitted or transferred on the day that you asked god to save your soul and to receive the new birth transmitted a life of wheat put in the cuckober right right and the life of the cucumber has been taken out what do you mean that old life you used to live same hand same mouth all the things you used to do when you were doing sinning in the world you still got them amen still got the kuckelber but it's been washed it's been sanctified and the life of the cuckoo bird has been taken out but the nature of the cuckover i was trying to we were explaining this sunday the nature of the cuckoo bird is still sticky now remember that's not talking about your soul that's right talk about your spirit realm memory reason conscious effects imagination because that's my problem now and my other problem is i don't let that eternal thing that's inside of me do a lot of work i'm just going to admit it but see look you can wound you wise you will all you want to with this quote as long as you're in this line you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but inside me somewhere i'm born again no as long as i'm in his life i'm sticky and i got a carnal nature now look it says carnal nature not carnal mind you had a carnal mind when you were in the world you're supposed to have the mind of christ when you get the new birth that's our problem is we're not getting a lot of new births we're getting anointings we're getting whoa and not a lot of sitting down and listening to really what god is saying to us but you have a carnal nature because why you can remember what you used to do you know where you did it at you still got the same eyeballs you still got the same brain human brain that tells you yeah you used to do that right over there remember you but you know what but inside of you you're born again that part's got to separate somewhere that's why i said when you're born again your soul is in another dimension it's in you it's not over there somewhere don't get me wrong but it's it's contrary to everything that's in this dimension everything that's right think about it you're all the soul that you were you weren't contrary to the world you did what they did right and you did it willingly but when god took the willingness out or the willing thing out you still got memories and conscious affection imagination a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin is what gone from you that's the thing pray and read your bible that's the thing pray and read your bible how are we going to get free from this pray and read your bible but i want to add one thing you've got to have the correct interpretation of the bible you can't just read the bible because people read about listen there's some sincere people in the world that read the bible every day read me read more than you do but what do they read it with denominational eyes they read them with three eyes most of them trinitarian ideas hell's eternal soul sleeping you got to remember every major doctrine come from right here good and bad you got to buy the baptism of the holy ghost though reject what's bad and take what's good all right let's uh just for a minute we need we know the first three dimensions of light time and matter we already talked about that and also luke 16 we're going to read that in a minute so just keep going and i really want you to see let's go to quote number four we were talking another day about sound barrier this world or this when god looked down through time okay when god looked down through time he saw what what was going to happen right that's the foreknowledge but he knew since the bible told us they would be ages after the acts 19 is everybody with me wake up acts 19 or acts or acts and go in the book of acts god knew that he'd have to come back in the holy ghost right holy ghost would have to come that's predestinated that ain't going to change but he had a group there that would take it right all right well now martin luther was not in our church age because he knew that part of martin luther would have was coming out of the catholic church see god looked down through history he saw history listen to him it wasn't history it was happening his dad said sunday is this what god thought of or is this what he's thinking if it's what he thought of he's not eternal because he thought of it back under and it's progressed all the way up no this is what he's thinking right now this is the thoughts of god brother brown said the thoughts of god are eternal so they can't change now the thought of part is going to go away the thought of part the the sinners the the the false doctrine and all those different things but look what happened i want you to understand this is why i keep reading this see what happened to us in the end time god had to come from another dimension and break into this dimension just like that plane i told you there were several other pilots there were several other luther wesley pentecost that came right up to what the plane started shaking we're about 640 miles an hour but i don't think we can take it and they back off we think speaking in tongues is it so we'll just take that we're going to land our plane yeah this is all we got this is it uh we did it but no there was a chuck yeager that was there one day if you read a story same thing happened plain about the fall apart he said i had about that much stick left or throttle left he said all i've done was pushed none of the others pushed brother branham gets in the plane and there's that much throttle left and all he does is push it breaks through the sound barrier and he said it just smoothed right out and man now they run 1500 miles an hour that's almost twice 700 miles an hour it's 1400 miles an hour that is twice past the sound barrier they just went right on past them why that's me and you that's the astronaut age they're running 14 000 miles an hour they're on another planet right now god's gonna have to clean mars off now because we've already touched it right everywhere man's been brother brown said god's gonna have to clean it off but there's two things that happen when you break a sound barrier there's a thunder how many of you heard it i mean you've heard them back when i was a kid they were just breaking because that was in the 50s they were breaking the sound barrier well they would come across and you could hear it and the plane would be 500 feet ahead of the boom but when they broke that sound barrier they were going faster than the speed of sound not light sound which is 700 miles an hour they broke that and it thundered and it made a halo cloud that's what happened in this day when the prophet of god went to arizona where do you think that come from they say oh yeah no some people say that was from a rocket i believe that it was a rocket called seven angel that brother brown says in this quote right here they came from eternity so fast right until they broke the sound barrier and it thundered well what did it do it told him what to do nobody else heard it as in all the different times of of paul being knocked down on the road to damascus and jesus standing in john 17 i think it is john 12 father glorified thy name there came a voice from heaven saying i've glorified it and glorified again people that stood by heard it said it thundered that's the problem most people in this message hear the thunder they see the cloud but they don't get the voice there was a mystery behind all that there was an opening of the word if we can just break through that static of superstition and things then the holy spirit just begins to fall around like anointing and just blesses the people you know when you receive the baptism in the holy ghost we always we always use the analogy that if somebody fell over dead right now you wouldn't have to open the door for their soul to get out no it just goes into another dimension well when you receive the new birth it was the soul of god and it came from a seventh dimension way faster than anything else come right through the wall wherever you were down on your knees crying praying people praying for you and boom did the work and you know what there was emotion there was some things went on but they didn't see an interview and they didn't see that old you die either but it happened it happened you know why because you walk now in newness of life listen if you don't walk in newness of life i'm telling you one more time kids to y'all that are 80. if you don't have the holy ghost you better find out right now whether you got it or not because it's not it's look but so many people today are babied petted that's one thing our pastor doesn't do and i thank god for that i have seen pastors pet people and pet them and pet them and they stayed babies because you pet babies brother dale don't do that he says shut up and do your work do your job do what you're supposed to do thank god for that but the fourth dimension let's look at that just for a second we know what happens in the fourth dimension we saw that before that just keep going go to the number yeah i just skipped that one i talked about that one that's the one where he talks about the angels coming from eternity there you go now we have contact through science the fourth dimension as it was because coming right through this building and i told you that the it goes by ohms or loops it the lowest one is like three and it's like 3 million cycles per second it cycles 3 million times whatever that wave is then there's one that's 300 billion times per second that they can go down and and man i mean how can you talk to somebody in a submarine that's two miles down in the ocean you gotta have something pretty fast and i tell you something else is pretty fast how long josh did it take for them pictures to get from mars to here how much 11 minutes and that's traveling at the speed of light do you know that the sun comes up about seven seconds before you see it eight minutes eight minutes the sun's come up and it takes eight minutes to travel that way even at 125 000. that's what speed of light's 125 000 miles per second per second so there is travel there is something that's got to be done that's what i'm telling you the same way with this those angels had to travel to come into this dimension to talk to brother branham then those angels in jeffersonville remember what brother brown said he said you know when the angel met him in the cave he said he just walked into that light where'd he come from he's in a cave by itself that angel had to slow down out of that whatever dimension he was in seventh dimension he had to slow down to step in that life where he could talk to brother branham because that was real folks that wasn't a spook that was real business but you and i have to have this sixth sense to contact what comes through the fourth dimension and not this junk coming right through this building now pictures voice radio pictures on television that our senses does not contact see i believe that you got one two and three you got four which is has no it's no it's not solid one two and three is pretty we're solid we're right here we can't go nowhere but now in the fourth dimension there's no there's no limitation same way with like it may take a little while for it to get to mars that signal but that signal comes from here travels to mars picks up the camera images and brings them back to earth that's pretty real but with god when he brings you a revelation you don't have to wait long for it you don't have to wait long for how many times were you sitting in a church i know boyd was in in the methodist church and just you know had a holy trinity taped on his forehead but when he heard the truth that was eternal that was something that came from another dimension it didn't come from this one your revelation does not come from this dimension your revelation comes from that seventh dimension comes right here to you and what you get puts you in the fifth to the sixth amen because what decision you make here because of what comes to you and then your travel then you either got to go to the fifth dimension which we'll talk about in just a second the fifth dimension which is hell but it's not burning we saw that before let's let's go on to number 10 let's skip some of this and we'll we'll get done here in just a second because remember we know what the fourth dimension is we know it's radial waves and we know it has no plug in it's it's all it's all wi-fi it's all the different things that you don't have to plug into the wall it's running through this building and i'm going to tell you something when i pray i pray that god doesn't influence there's certain people i pray for that i know that's being influenced by something going through that fourth dimension i just know that and that's what i pray as lord protect them because listen without the baptism of the holy ghost why do you when you were growing up when you were in the world why did you lean to all that because that was your influence that was what was bombarding you all the time that's why television they bombarded you with all those images and and subliminal things that they'd put a coca-cola real quick in there you know a long time ago when dad was growing up they had to anybody know what a what a drive-through restaurant is i mean drive-through uh theater is not many do you used to drive up to the theater put this thing in your car and watched the screen and most of the time it was like but anyway but that's what you were influenced by and then they would have subliminal messages that would be so fast and it would be a coca-cola or a popcorn right donny and you wonder why in the world why in the world am i hungry at the minute and i just eat three pizzas being a kid or a young adult i just eat three pizzas and drink three coca-colas and now i'm sitting here watching this movie in five minutes into the movie i need some popcorn wow that subliminal message was on that screen that you didn't see it it was so fast you couldn't see it with your natural eye but what picked it up your subconscious picked it up the spiritual part of you picked it up and it made this thing react to it remember they did away with that because they made it illegal because it was making people do all kinds of stuff and you never see it but once you slow it down you could see that image of that coca-cola or that popcorn with butter all over the pump card anyway so but see that's what listen you and our influence by that fourth dimension even brother brown said demons traveled in the fourth dimension cancers all that travel and where is it going it's going in here it's going in here not so much in your mouth but it's influencing you and you don't even know it right that's why with a carnal mind you can't contact god because you've got all that other stuff to contact but once you get the mind of christ what is it the base has found a receptor or somewhere it can send it to and then he can talk to you because listen that's one thing for sure the devil does not want you to have a revelation of god he does not he fights it he'll send you everything in the world but that so that fourth dimension absolutely still influences us even when we're talking on cell phone when we're doing all the different things wi-fi and all that it's beating your head you just don't know that it's beating your brain going through your conscious subconscious all the time all the time it's influencing you look now man it's it's just everywhere there's nothing plugged in anymore everything has to go through the airwaves amen now the fifth dimension is where the center of the unbeliever dies and goes to the fifth dimension is kind of well the horrible dimension now this man when the christian dies he goes in the sixth dimension and god is in the seventh dimension now then we see the christian when he dies he goes under the altar of god right into the presence of god under the altar and he's at rest to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not altogether asleep neither is he awake he's between sleep and awake and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep and he's not awake and to take that shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on earth and he cannot go into the presence of god because he's not fit to go there without the blood and he's caught he can't come back to earth because his time's finished here and he's caught between and he's in a nightmare he can't go in the presence of god to rest and he can't back come back to earth because his time's up he's in a nightmare and there he stays think about somebody like like cain or somebody that died i say un unregenerated he's been falling for years thousands of years so let's read this next one countdown then i think the fifth dimension is where the center dies where he goes now think that when the sinner dies he goes to this nate says fourth dimension he means fifth the first thing he cannot go in the presence of god because he's a sinner and his time's up on earth if i would type it for you it's like going to sleep how many of you been asleep the most vivid dream i ever had in my life was i got shot in the head with a gun my head hurt when i woke up just like somebody shot me in the head but that's how i woke me up somebody was robbing a convenience store and i was the i was trying to get him out out the door of the convenience store to you know keep the other people and i said take me outside but when he took me outside and saw the police he just he pulled the trigger when he did i felt the thing hit me in the head and woke me up but you know what i woke up though that's been years ago and i think i'm all right now but what about if you can't what if that's a recurring dream that you can't wake up from right what if that's something in your life that that maybe god came to you during a time of that and says here let me help you and you said no i don't want any help well whatever that was is just a recurring nightmare because remember look the presence of god is hell enough for me not having the presence of god not being able to be have grace not being able to know that there's a god that can save me and you being in a place where you came that's more hell than anything you burning up would be a pleasure but that recurring nightmare look hideous things are screaming that's the state of the wicked dead he can't go in the presence of god because he's a sinner he cannot return back to earth because his time's up and he's caught between the two things in the fifth dimension he's got a soul and he cannot go in the presence of god because it's not covered by the blood he's a sinner he cannot wake himself up because his time's up on earth so there he is in a tormented nightmare think of that now before you enter it a nightmare scream many of us have had nightmares it's just because you're told because the two consciences are passing sub and first conscious and it catches between how many of you had a weird dream but it's and you don't even know where in the world that come from well that's the two dimensions something something influenced that you just don't know exactly what it was and that's the nightmare when a sinner dies he's caught with his soul between earth and hell in a nightmare and there he stands all right let's go to the next one let's read that one for christ also once suffered for sin for just to the unjust now we know what happened there he went when he when he gave his life at calvary his soul didn't stay in the tomb his soul went down to hell and preached unto the soul upon to the spirits in prison now remember i have another quote but i'm not going to read it where brother brown said see they were people they were souls they could talk to him just like when he goes to paradise and he opens up the door and abraham says hey sarah that's the man we fed the calf to ezekiel was looking over his shoulder and said that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel all the different ones saw him in their own revelation but it was a man standing there it was god in theophany form was standing there amen by which you went and preached into the spirits of prison which sometimes were disobedient but once the long-suffering of god waited in the days of noah thank god for a prophet brother brown said that was all those people that died in the flood that turned god down because see everybody turned god down by eight people while the ark was preparing within wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water all right keep going number 12 souls in prison now jesus after he'd finished his ministry preached to those souls that were unsavable now god by foreign knowledge knew they were unsavable so he fixed the place for him but remember we're going to read here in just a second and then we'll close it's not a burning hell there is no judgment has been passed yet on anybody except the devil and the beast because the bible's already said that all right now watch he went and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not when mercy was given to them look that's what i mean that moment that they were given mercy they spurned it so whatever state they were in that's the state that they're sitting there in the loop i believe in the fifth dimension knowing and realizing that somebody did something for them and they rejected it when mercy was given to them they spurned mercy and now they're waiting for the judgment oh what a time that must have been oh i wish there's some way i could shake the world with that to let them see the reality see what the reality is all right let's go to 13. but after the days of his preaching his ministry continued on because the last group he preached to was the souls that were in hell that could not be forgiven i have clearly read that from the bible here in ii peter he went and preached to the souls that were in prison which is hell locked up until the day of judgment so they can't move because you see the judgment isn't now there is no burning hell now see thank god for that because you know what everybody said well now we're in hell burning no there's not a burning hell right now somebody tells you the guy's in the burning hell that's wrong a judge of this earth is just enough to never condemn a man until he's brought to trial so when we get to the white throne judgment that's the trial and god will never throw a man into the fiery furnace until first he is condemned by god's own laws he rejected mercy so you see he first has to have a trial and the trial is the great white throne judgment but now he's in a place called a prison house all right let's read this in luke and then we'll finish right here and there was a certain beggar named lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and desired to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores and it came to pass that the beggar died and it was he was carried by the angels into abraham's bosom now remember we know that's paradise that's not the sixth dimension but there was a place there for those old testament saints called paradise it wasn't that abraham was sitting there and everybody was sitting in his chest his bosom it was the faith abraham was the father of faith they died with a what with a they had a testimony that they believed what abraham believed and desired to be filled with the crumbs and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments now remember there's no burning hell but he's being tormented right and in hell he lifted up his eyes who the rich young ruler being in torments and seeth abraham afar off because look from that paradise to where that rich young world was must have not been a complete wall that must have been be able to see through the dimensions they were so close because remember look let me be honest paradise was a holding place until calvary they couldn't go in the presence of god under bulls and goats that's why i said they they they did there was no new birth in the old testament so there can't be a sixth dimension that you can put there like brother branham because remember when samuel was brought up samuel was not a young man samuel was the same prophet that brother brown said he had his prophet robe and everything still on and they recognized who he was now listen when brother brown went across the curtain of time he couldn't recognize a bunch of them people except the ones he saw when he was younger the 90-year-old woman that got eternal life he didn't know who she was he started when she was 90 years old so that place of to me paradise was just a holding place waiting christ to die on the cross then he could empty up that and put him in a dimension but lazarus and he left hell in hell the rich young ruler lifted up his eyes being in torments and see if abraham are far off at lazarus in his bosom in other words they were standing together all right and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented by this flame now i look that word flame up it does not mean fire it means a torment not a literal flame because the prophet just told us there is no burning hell at the moment all right but look that word up it doesn't always mean fire it's a torment but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime see you don't lose your senses when you go in these dimensions because abraham is telling that man boy remember what happened abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receiveth thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he has comforted and thou art tormented you know i preached that sermon one time why was the heathen rage i should have read that scripture let them rage all they want to look what the rich young ruler got and look what lazarus god and beside all this between us and you there's a great gulf fish in other words there's a dimension you can't we can't pass so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from there or from thence look then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou would ascend him to my father's house for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them who the lazarus lest they also come into this place of torment abraham said unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them in other words they're still alive they have a choice they got to hear what the prophet said but the rich young willer didn't have a choice he doesn't made his choice and abraham said nay father and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent now watch what abraham say if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead because why they made their choice they're where they're they're where they're at and that's where they're gonna have to stay is that all right that's where they're gonna have to stay and we'll get to i wanna read this one more part they don't have this revelation six verse nine i've been studying a little bit on the sixth seal fifth seal and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw on the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god now remember we're over in here now the fifth seal opens over here the fifth seal didn't open in the in the old testament so there's a place of holding for that fifth sealed jew that's not in the sixth and can't be in the fifth it's gotta be somewhere in there though but it's a holding place because watch when it opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar now remember they can't be under the altar of god because watch what happens and they cry with a loud voice saying how long lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood that's where brother brown got through revelation that that wasn't christians because christians would not call for blood he said that's the fifth sealed jew that's going to be given eternal life avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth revelation 6 11 says in white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should what rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were we know that's 144 000 should be fulfilled so there's a place of holding for them too you know why because god saw listen to this come on musician god saw he had to blind the jews god saw he had to blind the jews to get me and you because the jews were his first love the jews were his first wife the jews were the david apple of his eye but he knew they would do what they were going to do but he couldn't make them listen come on ellie they let's stand our feet ellie's going to come up here and sing a song or

their eyes you and i wouldn't have come in he would have took the jews they would have been his wife there would have been nothing else left and he'd have been just like the old testament he said destroy every one of them because you're my people and then i'm going to put you in the promised land right that's what he would have done but he knew what they would do he knew they would fall he knew they would go hard but he knew there would be a rahab he knew there would be a woman at the well he knew there'd be somebody that'd say be it unto me according to my word i'll take the scraps off
