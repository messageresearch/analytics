========================================

let's start up with the call and greetings to all of you that came in late now today's topic is a continuation from the last one which was communion communion testing be better trying to get it at just the right spot okay so let's turn to Ephesians chap 2 verse 13 and you notice even in Galatians all through the scripture this theme of the stature of perfect man is repeated you're you're growing God's bringing you from crying out the father to he's grow bringing you from crying out as a baby into uh closer and closer walk with God and and um so me and brother Wade are going to cross lines a little bit and um so let's let's read from Ephesians 2 verse 13 and talk about communion chapter two but now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby now there's communion let's let's let's go to the Lord in prayer real quick because he always want to pray um you know prayer is part of the the community communion act with between man and god let's Lord Jesus we just thank you God for your grace to us today Lord thank you for giving us traveling mercies yesterday and we all went to the fellowship meeting Lord and I pray God that you'll just be with brother way this morning as Minister us today Lord and open our hearts to hear your word and to see more of who you are and who we are Grant it Lord bless the sick and Afflicted and and be with the ones that couldn't be here today we pray in your name amen so I I hope you kind of are getting a picture of what God is doing is is he bringing us the the whole the stature of perfect man is really the central point of of uh it just Blends together all of these different doctrines Genesis 12627 one man made up of many many people he we got the statute of perf man down through the seven Church ages God is building up a body where he can come and dwell in fullness and that body is made up of lots of different people so he's bringing that Heavenly pattern like we talked about and and uh Moses went up the mountain and he saw uh God showed him the Heavenly pattern of how he should build a tabernacle so God's taking that Heavenly pattern and bringing it down to earth and how is he bringing it down to earth he's he's doing it through through through different stages of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost where at Faith then you can be begin taking the Lord's Supper because you're you're in communion with God but yet you're not in full communion and that's what uh brother Wade's going to get to when he starts talking about adoption is he's bringing us into closer and closer until we're in total agreement and that's the plan now now what I'm kind of getting to maybe I'm cheating a little bit you know somebody was telling me they called Microsoft support and when they got on the phone with Microsoft at at work they they said now this is what we're going to do and then they told them everything that they were going to do so I'm kind of telling you this is what we're going to do and then we'll get into the details because you we kind of get in our head that justification is something that just happens once it's like a one shot thing you get one shot to get your sins chopped off but justification you know brother Dale's been teaching that there's a mysterious part of justification a mysterious part of sanctification after you get the Holy Ghost there's still justification but you know if you if you do something wrong go to the Lord and get down on your knees like uh uh somebody was mentioning in one of the Sunday School classes that that that God saw that David had the right kind of attitude he's a man after God heart because when he did something wrong he ran quickly to the Lord God forgive me of what I've done even after you get the new birth if you do something wrong then quickly run to the Lord and he'll chop off your SE it's the Holy Ghost uh the Holy Ghost doing a work in you even after you've got the new birth to bring you into perfect communion with God and then what happens now this is the this is kind of this quote that brother Brown said back in 1959 kind of sums up where we're going it's just amazing that the things that brother brandham brought out in detail later on his ministry were also preached early on in his ministry they you go back and see the seals the stature for perfect man the uh all these things and I maybe he didn't even realize what he was saying because he said you know he'll get up and and the one time he said I I was preaching and my I just left my body and I was watching myself preach the Lord just completely took him over and began to speaking maybe he didn't even know what he was saying what was the Holy Ghost given for 1959 he said God poured himself into Christ correct Christ poured himself into the church therefore now watch and that day you will know that I am in the father and you are in me and I am in you and that day you'll know it right for the whole thing is one Plan of Redemption coming down that God coming back to live in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning now look look now he's talking about coming down and we know that the Rapture when brother preached the Rapture message it was contrary to what we thought we thought the Rapture would be us going up which it is you know but what is it really it's God coming down right by the word to make us to to build us up into an image well let's I'll let brother say it now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions wait I think I no I didn't skip over now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions and gets his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then there will come an Eden he'll take his church back to where it left him at back to an Eden again that there where it fell and now that's where it made it it first start of fall there's where it'll be taken right back with every clean state of redemption now how can you be in speeding condition if you don't fully uh have a full revelation of God's plan of who you are of who he is of what God's doing because brother Brown said I don't have that quote right now but the the the bride will know his will and his will this is his will his will is for you to have perfect communion with him to have not just uh you know it started off in in the Ephesus age the the on the day of Pentecost and and they they uh you know they the church began to grow but now in this day something special has to happen had to happen for us to take a body change and that's what happened when the seals were open and from 1963 on the the word began to preach in a way that could that could bring us back into full communion to Total uh to join us together in perfect Oneness of unity with Christ so that's that's kind of the plan what I'm what I'm talking about now 2 Corinthians I'm just kind of read some scriptures 2 Corinthians chapter 5:18 and 19 all things are of God who ha reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and haveth committed unto us the word of Recon reconciliation CU that's what what communion is is Recon reconciling reconciliation is I just print out the definition is to restore friendly relations between it's to cause to coexist in a Harmony or make or show to be compatible it's uh you know if you at work we do Financial things and and if if if you got some numbers missing or something out of place you got to reconcile it you go got to go back to the source and figure out where what's missing now that's what God's doing if there's anything that's not exactly right in your life and and brother brother Dale brother wa has has you know as we's talking about the statute of perfect man he's going through how the Holy Spirit washes you out and cleanses you and gets all the things all the little Trash that's not exactly right out to bring you into perfect reconciliation now you can see how when you when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can take communion cuz you're now the Lord can teach you the holy spirit is is dwelling inside of you and he's your teacher and can instruct you and and show you how to walk but now he's bringing us that that's what the seals the the that Capstone had to do to bring us back into perfect perfect communion with him so that we can take a body change and communion is always the communion has always been the kind of the problem what what what kind of got me thinking about this topic was we were at a fellowship meeting many months ago and we were standing outside and uh with all brothers and this as this brother walked up and uh one of the brothers said uh do you know he telling to talking to other brother do you know that brother he said well I know him but you know I don't really know him and and I wonder sometimes if that's how we are with Jesus Christ we we have heard about it maybe we we've uh we know we know him but do you know him and that's the whole basis of the Christian experience if you if you try to approach Christianity without communion then you're doing it based on the wrong motive the wrong objective because the whole purpose of communion is to know Jesus Christ and and you know we know by the scripture that the only way to know Jesus Christ to know God is by his word but it starts with communion it's start remember brother brother brandom telling that story of how he first wanted to know God and he he a letter to God and he put it out of the woods and he said I know you walk by here I want to talk to you I might be paraphrasing that wrong but but the that's how my journey started is I I I I didn't want to know I didn't want to just knowledge I didn't want to just know about him but I wanted to know him and that's the whole point of the Christian Journey the whole Christian experience if if you find yourself maybe getting off a little off track and maybe um cuz God wants to know you too if you he he's your pear of great price and your his it works both ways see he wants to and and uh you you know part of the journey is that God is unfolding his will to you and the first step in justification one of the things that I believe God reveals in justification is that he wants to save you now let's maybe look at uh a little example let's turn to John 12 and we're going to go to John and then Matthew and then Mark and then back to John now we were just reading in Galatians about the Bond woman and the free and how this that theme is is repeated all through scriptures there's two lines there's one that's got the promise and one that's Bound by their own their trees and trees and traditions and and their own ideas and everything and and and and here we're going to read a little story that if you kind of read between the lines you're looking at somebody that wanted communion somebody that wanted to know God and somebody that just wanted a name for themselves that wanted to set up a little personal Kingdom that wanted to to to make thems look great now now there's the problem because communion is just between you and God if you try to put if you try to uh it's about you know ministering really if if a minister I you know I haven't been ministering that long but this is you know I believe that if a minister gets into the way if somebody else is communion then then you're getting close to nickan ISM the ministers are to introduce somebody to Christ there's God if you get in the way then that that messes up the the the plan of communion right now John 12 tells this little story of the suffer of Bethany when Mary came and washed Jesus's feet let's just read through it real quick let's start at verse one then Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he whom he raised from the dead there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that ate at the table with him that sat at the table with him then Mary took and took Mary a pound of ointment of spiter very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment then saith one of his disciples Judas is scariot Simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor now we know this story brother B told it in in such a dramatic way about Jesus with dirty feet and all is about how this little woman was afraid that Jesus wouldn't accept her and she was looking she was ready to give everything away to Jesus because she wanted she didn't she wasn't maybe so interested in knowing uh at that time all the technical details but she wanted a relationship with God that's what the whole Christian experience is based on is a relationship with God she wanted communion with him now Jes Judas on the other hand was looking for a flaw and I I've read I I spent some time reading a lot of quotes about Judas and and and the thing that brother BR pointed out about Judas was he was he was kind of alone looking for looking to find fault looking to find something where he could say there it is there is the problem and this is what this was the turning point I believe in Jesus's life when he he came along through justification and sanctification and here comes this little woman that's willing to give up everything and Judas has a problem with her spending a lot of money on the the the O and watch what he does then saith one of his disciples you his car Simon son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor he was he was after money he was after he was more wanting to make himself look like a good Christian a good person look look how concerned I am for the poor look how look look what great things I'm doing this he said now there's the explanation not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bu what was put therein then Jesus said let her alone against the day of my buring has she kept this for the poor always ye have with with me with you but me have not always now the word when the word is presented it always separates sure you don't have to be mean and nasty to get somebody to to you know to separate the word you know Jesus Jesus would mean he just told him like it was you don't you're not always going to have me what she did was right and correct and this was judas's right after this we'll read in in Matthew and Mark now look look in John what it says much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came let's see let's skip down to verse 10 10 but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus alter also to death because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus now they're looking to kill people they're looking they're looking to to to kill Lazarus and Jesus and all they needed was somebody to help out somebody that was not interested in relationship with God they were more interested in building their ownself up oh man I'm not going to finish it off let's go to Matthew 26 and kind of read another version of this story told To Us by Matthew okay this starts at verse 6 but we're going to kind of skip through that uh that uh retailing um he said where where verse 13 whereever this gospel shall be preached in the old world there sh also this this woman has done be told a memorial for her then one of the 12 called Judas escari went unto the chief priest and said unto them what will you give me and I will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for 30 pieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him now I won't I I won't read uh just to save time I won't read in in Mark 14 but you can if if you want to but look there's a story there's a story of two people there two the two different strange if you will one that wanted communion with God that wanted a relationship with him and the other that just wanted to build himself up now I was I was kind of getting somewhere let me see let me see what I'm going to do all right let me let me skip over this cuz you remember last time in the in the lesson I kind of briefly showed this this is Bloom's taxonomy which is how they they teach kids in school that they start off with knowledge and they they they build up this pyramid now see you got two pyramids you got two ways of looking at it there's one that wants communion with God and the other wants to build themselves up I was going to read um the three things that that Nimrod wanted when he built the Tower of Babel and those are the things I believe those are the same three things that that uh maybe Judas wanted there three things that kind of that kind of stumble it it it gets you off of communion let's turn over to Genesis 10 I'm going to try not to rush a little bit cuz I want my goal is for everybody to understand I so let me just just relax a little bit and we'll just take our time and if we run into next Sunday then that that'll be fine let's go to Genesis 10 and verse 8 says Kush beg Nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth and if you go to verse 11 it says the whole earth was of one language and of one speech sounds like communion again everybody was brother Bram said when he explained this little story he said everybody was in one Accord they they they they believe one God they you know believe they just spoke one language and and then Here Comes Kush with a little saying and he put it in nimrod's hand and he took that saying and turned it into something to he he began building that's always how it starts it starts off with a little this a little saying and then it some becomes something tangible over time and and that's that's the same thing Judas had J just Judas something the devil was speaking to him a little saying and then he turned around and here comes 30 pieces of silver that he's he's willing and dealing with it starts off uh you can you can see how these everything just ties together the seals the statue of perfect man Genesis 1:26-27 Daniel 70 weeks Daniel 70 weeks is talking about by bringing reconciliation to the nation of Israel uh he you know all the all the sixfold purposes to bring reconciliation and uh end of sin and all those things but but look in Genesis chap 11 the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found a plane in the land of Shar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for Stone and slime had they for Mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth what do you think that sounds like let's build us something big that stretches all the way up to heaven so that we can get to close to God by knowledge that's not God's plan we know what God's plan is don't we we should right and and of course we're going to read that God had a problem with that uh and and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men build it and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they began to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and they confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the the Lord scattered them abroad from then upon the face of all the Earth and they left off to build the city therefore as the name of it called Babel because the Lord did their confound the language of all the Earth and from then did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the Earth you can build a tower of knowledge to try to get to God but it'll never work that's not God's plan the the the the latter to of know to to uh to to Unity and Oneness with God is by his word that's the only way you'll ever see God that's the only way you'll ever understand his will is to Value his word and the the the the Judas and the see that they always had a problem with communion when Jesus said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood and they left communion cuz they they didn't really want communion with God they didn't want fellowship with him they were so stuck on their Idols their their their traditions and their their their own carnal knowledge that that that my point is that that's what the whole Christian experience is about it's about fellowship with God and and talking to him and becoming one with him and and and that's why so much of scripture talks about when you go into your secret place you commune with God and then he'll declare it openly now if you if you do it the other way like Judas or like Nimrod and maybe next time we'll get into a little bit more details about nemi but you try to the three things that brother random said he wanted to do let me let me switch back to that he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished and if you see that's backwards God go let God make put you in a like like in Proverbs if you go to try to sit at the high place you might get moved down to the lower place but sit at the lower place and let God put you up and that's that's what the plan is now you know Nimrod he wanted to do three things and God wanted to do three things we maybe we'll talk about that next time
