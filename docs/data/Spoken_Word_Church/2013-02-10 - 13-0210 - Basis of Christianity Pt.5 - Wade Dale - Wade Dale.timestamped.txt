[0:01] that one either
[0:03] let's go back review and read
[0:07] review and read chapter 18.
[0:12] all right
[0:17] okay what's the date 10.
[0:32] this is
[0:36] okay
[0:39] okay we're in now okay
[0:42] 18 verse four let's back up for a second
[0:44] the words of a man's mouth are as deep
[0:46] Waters
[0:48] that can be good or bad
[0:50] and the Wellspring of wisdom is a
[0:52] flowing Brook it's not good to accept
[0:54] the person of the wicked
[0:56] to overthrow the righteous in Judgment
[0:58] of Fool's lips enter into contention and
[1:00] his mouth calls for stroke
[1:03] a Fool's mouth is his destruction
[1:07] and his lips are the snare of his soul
[1:10] the words of a tail Bearer are his
[1:12] wounds and they go down into the
[1:14] innermost parts of the belly
[1:17] you know what a tail bear is Right
[1:19] paddle tail Busy Body somebody talks all
[1:22] the time about others all right so we
[1:24] got to quit that the Bible says our
[1:26] Whisperer
[1:28] the words of a Whisperer that's in the
[1:30] original all right verse nine
[1:33] he also let it slothful in his work his
[1:36] brother to him that is a great waster
[1:40] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[1:42] the righteous run into it and it's safe
[1:47] the rich man's wealth is a strong City
[1:49] and is in high wall
[1:52] in his own conceit
[1:54] Before Destruction the heart of man is
[1:58] haughty
[1:59] and before honor is humility look at the
[2:03] difference look at that Before
[2:04] Destruction the heart of man is haunting
[2:09] and before honor is humility
[2:11] all right
[2:12] he's an actress of matter before he
[2:15] Hearth it it is finally in shame unto
[2:18] him in other words somebody that stands
[2:19] up and
[2:20] makes comment of something or or hearsay
[2:23] or whatever
[2:25] the spirit of a man will sustain his
[2:27] infirmity
[2:29] but a wounded Spirit who can who can
[2:31] bear
[2:32] The Heart Of The Prudent giveth
[2:34] knowledge and the ear of the wise
[2:36] seeketh knowledge
[2:40] now verse 16.
[2:42] a man's gift maketh room for him same
[2:45] thing with you sisters too this is
[2:47] sisters and brothers and bringeth him
[2:49] before Great Men
[2:53] we see that a lot of times you know you
[2:55] want to do something for the Lord and if
[2:57] it's not your gift to do
[2:59] it's not going to prosper but if it is a
[3:01] gift that God gave you if it is
[3:03] something a man's gift maketh room for
[3:05] him in other words if you got a gift of
[3:07] of wisdom then God's going to make room
[3:09] for that gift of wisdom if it's of God
[3:11] right all right and same thing with
[3:13] preaching or teaching or anything else
[3:15] you just gotta know though like I I
[3:18] don't try to
[3:19] I don't try to make myself be an
[3:22] evangelist I'm not
[3:24] I'm just not just not my mold and that's
[3:26] not my gift
[3:28] my gift is teaching breaking things down
[3:30] and and getting people to understand
[3:32] things and trying to make it you know a
[3:33] little bit on the fun side so we don't
[3:35] get so mundane in our in our learning
[3:40] but that you have to make room for
[3:42] yourself okay
[3:45] that's what the problem I see with a lot
[3:46] of people in the message we've got a lot
[3:47] of bangers wanting to be pastors
[3:50] a lot of pastors want to be evangelist
[3:52] you can't do that
[3:54] you got to stand the gift that God gave
[3:56] you all right if you stand the gift God
[3:58] give you you know what he'll make you
[3:59] more successful than what you think
[4:01] you'd be doing something else all right
[4:03] and that's the same thing with anything
[4:06] we need to pray you know of course we
[4:07] all have desires and this is what I was
[4:09] thinking about we all have desires to do
[4:11] things yes but maybe that's just not the
[4:14] gift that God if God gives you a certain
[4:16] gift then take that gift and use it
[4:18] nurture it do something with that gift
[4:20] all right uh even your sisters if your
[4:23] gift is just to be a homemaker then
[4:25] guess what just be on a good one just be
[4:27] a good Homemaker all right if he wants
[4:29] you to do something and go out for the
[4:31] Lord and testify or whatever
[4:34] do it
[4:36] but a man's gift maketh room for him and
[4:38] bringeth him before Great Men
[4:40] he that is first in his own cause sameth
[4:43] judge but his neighbor cometh and
[4:45] searches him
[4:47] all right
[4:48] in other words your neighbor's gonna
[4:50] know what's going on
[4:51] by the fruits that you bear that's what
[4:53] we've been talking about that's what
[4:54] we're talking about now about our fruits
[4:56] and living me a sermon
[5:00] let's go to 19 a brother offended it's
[5:02] harder to be one than a strong City now
[5:04] look at that a brother offended
[5:07] verse 19 a brother offended
[5:13] you see that is harder to be one
[5:17] than in other words a walled City with
[5:19] and you've got 50
[5:22] 000 troops
[5:24] it's easier to take that City that wall
[5:26] city and fight your way through it than
[5:28] it is
[5:30] to offend a brother
[5:32] so let's think about that
[5:34] just food for thought a man's belly
[5:37] shall be satisfied with the fruit of his
[5:39] mouth
[5:40] in other words what's in there
[5:42] is going to come out not just the belly
[5:45] of your general your belly
[5:47] it's talking about the inner part of you
[5:50] and with the increase of his lips shall
[5:52] be filled
[5:54] death and life are in the power of the
[5:57] tongue
[5:59] brother Brown said you can kill somebody
[6:01] with your influence without physically
[6:03] killing them and it's worse than just
[6:05] physically killing them all right
[6:10] and they that love it shall eat the
[6:13] fruit thereof
[6:15] so what's the fruit that that's going to
[6:16] Bear death and life death and life are
[6:18] in the power of the tongue and they that
[6:20] love it shall eat the fruit thereof
[6:23] who shall findeth a wife
[6:26] find it's a good thing
[6:29] and obtains favor of the Lord
[6:32] you're not just going to make your wife
[6:33] happy and you happy you're going to make
[6:34] the Lord happy
[6:37] the poor uses and treaties
[6:39] but the rich and shrimp
[6:42] roughly
[6:44] all right
[6:45] so you have to kind of be careful you
[6:47] can watch the uh I was looking for a
[6:50] quote I got one on being somebody being
[6:51] flattered or flattering
[6:54] just be careful when you start
[6:55] flattering
[6:57] because uh
[7:02] you can Heap a lot of things on her head
[7:04] to see the rich and ruffling the poor
[7:06] uses in previous so you have to kind of
[7:08] watch
[7:09] sometimes it is
[7:11] if you're if you're rich in God it is
[7:14] it is okay to be a little sharp it is
[7:16] okay to be a little you know say hey
[7:18] this is the way it's got to be because
[7:20] we're sheep we got to be led so we have
[7:22] to be told things what to do right all
[7:25] right right and that's just the way it
[7:26] is all of us all right same way with us
[7:29] and you know say who so find that the
[7:31] wife finds a good thing I'm trying to
[7:33] favor the Lord don't think about that
[7:35] just as your spouse
[7:36] you're the wife of Jesus Christ
[7:39] so whoso if Christ finds us a good wife
[7:43] us the bride
[7:45] you'll obtain favor from the Lord
[7:48] but oh my goodness be careful
[7:51] if we do things wrong because we will be
[7:53] chasing all right a man that has friends
[7:56] verse 24 must show himself friendly
[7:59] remember what I said about Abraham
[8:01] Lincoln
[8:01] Abraham Lincoln he said hey if we make
[8:05] our enemies our friends we've defeated
[8:06] our enemies that's what we need to start
[8:08] doing
[8:10] instead of instead of trying to put the
[8:12] person down just make them your friend
[8:15] and there is a brand that's stickers
[8:17] closer than a brother
[8:19] all right verse chapter 19 let's
[8:22] continue I want to get down to a point
[8:23] right here
[8:25] stop better is the poor that walketh in
[8:27] his integrity
[8:30] this is what we're talking about
[8:31] integrity
[8:33] see better is the poor that walketh in
[8:36] Integrity than he that is perverse in
[8:39] his left and is a fool
[8:43] our fruits are going to show what we are
[8:45] that's right and better is the poor that
[8:47] walketh in his integrity
[8:50] sometimes I'd rather have a poor man
[8:52] if he's pouring wealth
[8:55] right but have integrity have something
[8:58] you know something to show I've seen
[9:00] people like that but I've seen people
[9:02] that had millions of dollars that I
[9:04] didn't want to even listen to what they
[9:05] had to say right
[9:08] also that the soul be without knowledge
[9:10] it is not good he that hastes with his
[9:12] feet Senate
[9:16] he that hate in other words you'd go out
[9:19] you go out past the program of God
[9:24] brother Brown said you see him laying on
[9:25] the side of the road scrap heaps of
[9:27] ministers God has a program
[9:30] and how many times you've seen preachers
[9:31] I've seen preachers go go way out here
[9:34] go away from the program of God well you
[9:37] know what
[9:39] the steady ones is gonna The Tortoise
[9:42] and the hair all either went through
[9:43] because Dave Ramsey course you know who
[9:44] always wins that's why that being there
[9:47] like to read the book
[9:49] called in the end the turtle always wins
[9:51] that's right because the hair went out
[9:52] here and said oh I'm out here and I got
[9:54] all this great stuff and I'm this and
[9:55] this but that hair just I mean that
[9:57] tortoise just kept going day by day
[9:59] walking day by day now I think that's
[10:01] what God wants us to do we see a lot of
[10:03] things that that we want to try to
[10:05] manufacture well if we try to
[10:07] manufacture it I'll promise you one
[10:09] thing it'll fail that's right if we try
[10:11] to manufacture it it will fail that's
[10:13] why I'm just saying about the gifts God
[10:15] Will Make Room for a gift
[10:17] best thing for you to do is to be
[10:19] pliable enough instead of just say well
[10:20] this is what I'm going to do
[10:23] it's a lot different than saying I'm
[10:25] going to try this and see how the Lord
[10:26] you know see how the Lord feels about it
[10:28] because you know what he wants us to be
[10:30] successful but he wants us to be
[10:32] successful in what in what he wants us
[10:33] to do that's right okay not what not a
[10:36] lot of times what we want to do but what
[10:38] he wants us to do that's the same thing
[10:40] talking to your neighbor going to
[10:42] Walmart and I'm telling you I may be
[10:44] just real
[10:45] overboard on this but even walking down
[10:48] the aisles at Walmart if someone's
[10:49] laying in the floor I'll pick it up I
[10:50] may not put it back in the same place
[10:52] but I'll put it up somewhere to keep a
[10:54] kid from kicking it all at all the place
[10:56] and what in our parking lot the other
[10:58] day people throw down drink bottles and
[11:00] stuff pick them up I've seen people walk
[11:01] by them and kick them you know no pick a
[11:03] thing up make it make as you go through
[11:06] life make what's behind you better
[11:09] and if you do that you know what that's
[11:11] characteristics you say oh this is just
[11:13] this is just Mind Over Matter well
[11:16] maybe it is
[11:18] but I see in the scripture where where
[11:20] Solomon was a wise man he did what God
[11:23] told him to do
[11:24] right he was one of the wisest men in
[11:26] the world and he asked for wisdom and
[11:28] God gave him wisdom plus riches but if
[11:31] he would have asked for riches first
[11:33] he would have never got wisdom he might
[11:35] have got the riches but he never got the
[11:37] wisdom but he asked for wisdom first
[11:39] right right man then God said okay
[11:41] you've asked for wisdom and you've not
[11:43] asked for well I'm gonna go ahead and
[11:45] give you wealth too because by your
[11:47] wisdom
[11:48] you're going to be able to handle your
[11:50] wealth right
[11:52] that's what we're talking about in in
[11:53] the Dave Ramsey course and I agree 100
[11:55] God's not going to give you something
[11:58] oh
[12:00] and then you mishandle it
[12:03] I said if God gives you something and
[12:06] you don't want you to miss handle it he
[12:08] wants you to do the right thing with it
[12:10] same way with money I don't believe some
[12:12] people have money because God knows you
[12:13] can't handle it
[12:15] but if you'll start doing the principles
[12:17] and say Hey I want the wisdom of how to
[12:19] do this then God will bring the things
[12:21] together and we can live a better
[12:22] comfortable more comfortable life
[12:25] what you're saying is it and it goes
[12:27] down to trivial stuff too because let me
[12:29] tell you what happened to me now what I
[12:31] do now is when you go in the supermarket
[12:34] and you get something and you get so far
[12:35] you say well I don't want it and you
[12:37] just put it in the place they're gonna
[12:38] but now I'm very conscious of it and
[12:40] it's it weighs on your mind where you
[12:43] have to man you have to go six or seven
[12:44] hours back you take it and put it back
[12:46] in the same spot right yeah what
[12:48] happened is okay what I did my son
[12:50] daughter said well Grandma I don't have
[12:52] to take this as an um we have to take it
[12:54] you don't want it we have to take it
[12:55] back and it grows on over into it
[12:58] absolutely
[12:59] that's what that's the little trivial
[13:02] stuff that you don't expect until you
[13:04] start thinking about I want to be like
[13:06] Christ right ain't going on and you say
[13:08] well that's trivial and I know from the
[13:10] past experience I get something I don't
[13:12] want that whatever but I always had
[13:20] and what they're gonna do is take it
[13:22] back later somebody's gonna take it back
[13:24] and they're gonna put it back in there
[13:26] somebody's gonna get it or whatever and
[13:29] you think about it
[13:31] last time we're missing it in the walk
[13:34] let's try to do our walk right to first
[13:36] if we do our walk right God has got
[13:38] listen God has got to honor that
[13:42] it's not like we're just living good be
[13:43] good people no God's Gonna honor that if
[13:45] you do something right God will honor
[13:48] that and if we're children of God he's
[13:50] going to honor us much more I believe I
[13:52] just believe he'll want to rest more
[13:53] than somebody just you know brother
[13:55] Brown said some of these virtues were
[13:57] were you know were not god-given but
[14:00] they were Natures out in the world of
[14:01] people that were Mickey Mouse well
[14:03] that's okay but how take that though and
[14:05] put god with it and see what you can do
[14:08] y'all don't know but your pastor every
[14:11] Sunday morning this is the messiest
[14:12] place for that long giveaway thing over
[14:15] there he picks a whole grounds every
[14:18] time he messenger right
[14:20] and you know what yeah
[14:23] it makes you look better and we got a
[14:24] better place to be and
[14:26] and you know what it's just like when
[14:28] the Bible says honor your father and
[14:30] mother that your days belong on the face
[14:31] of the Earth well that doesn't say
[14:32] Christians that just says honor your
[14:34] father and mother that your days will be
[14:35] long that's why a lot of young people I
[14:37] believe are dying at Young ages because
[14:39] they dishonor their parents yes
[14:42] you dishonor your parents then
[14:45] it's just Bible
[14:47] but we're trying to take Natural Things
[14:50] to be a natural brother Brown said if
[14:52] we're missing it in the walk let's try
[14:54] to walk first right then God's going to
[14:57] bring these things right but if you make
[15:00] if you make a wall where God can't get
[15:03] to you
[15:04] with these virtues that are god-given
[15:08] then you're stopping God I mean it's not
[15:10] it's not God stopping God wants to give
[15:12] everybody these virtues but
[15:16] we need to have these virtues working in
[15:17] our life and I'm afraid like sister
[15:20] Johnny
[15:21] I used to not do that but I feel
[15:23] condemned at laying something up true
[15:26] you know what I go back and do it now
[15:29] we'll put it back put the thing back up
[15:30] don't put the do this do you know toys
[15:33] and stuff now I really don't try to look
[15:35] for the same thing to hang it up on but
[15:36] I'll at least put it back in the toy
[15:38] department you know and stuff like that
[15:40] and they just make make the place better
[15:42] and you know what if it doesn't do
[15:43] anything it gets that little devil that
[15:46] says
[15:47] it says you should have put that back if
[15:50] you were who you think you are well you
[15:53] know what the best thing to do is go put
[15:54] it back and he ain't got something to
[15:56] worry about it I was just along the same
[15:59] line I was just saying along what you're
[16:01] saying about putting things but just
[16:03] little trivial things like that
[16:05] the times that I have not done it it's
[16:08] it's almost it's more than like the
[16:09] little devil it feels like it kills
[16:11] something for me right in my spirit
[16:12] right like something dies that's right
[16:15] then when you go to pray there it is one
[16:18] condemnation pops up
[16:21] so if we can get rid of that
[16:23] that's what I want us to do here all
[16:26] right you know I don't want us to say
[16:27] well this and this is deep stuff
[16:29] this is deeper than anything that that's
[16:32] going on
[16:33] because brother Brown freaks God hidden
[16:36] and revealed hidden and revealed in
[16:39] Simplicity before he started to seal
[16:42] so it's the simple it's the simple
[16:44] things we got to do and then that little
[16:46] devil hops on the other shoulder once
[16:48] you've picked it up and he said now
[16:50] that's that was a good thing to do
[16:52] that's right that's one word one more
[16:54] step into heaven you don't you don't do
[16:56] it
[16:57] right that works well you get a nod from
[16:59] God and that's what brother Ram walked
[17:01] through life he got a nod from God why
[17:03] because he did a wrestling if we start
[17:05] doing the right things we might get a
[17:06] nod from God every once in a while you
[17:09] know he might say hey
[17:10] good idea good thing to do that's great
[17:13] keep it up brother Joe yeah
[17:17] they cracked up a pallets and they have
[17:19] fellas everywhere instead of me going
[17:21] around I pick them up from the garbage
[17:22] can sure absolutely and you know what
[17:24] somebody sees that
[17:27] somebody sees that and and even in our
[17:30] job I've told I've tried to get it to
[17:32] these young people if you would just act
[17:34] a little bit different than the others
[17:36] they'll pray they'll make you assistant
[17:37] manager
[17:39] and most time they'll make you a manager
[17:41] yet because the assistant the manager is
[17:45] they're just there for a job if you
[17:46] would just if you just do that man just
[17:49] that one little bit so you have a hand
[17:51] up yes no you had your palm up yeah
[17:55] bus 19. could you expound to that one
[17:59] a brother offended it's harder to be one
[18:01] than a strong City
[18:03] don't don't offend a brother because
[18:04] it's very hard to win him back yes
[18:07] that's right it's harder
[18:10] to be one than a strong City an offended
[18:12] brother it's harder to be one than like
[18:14] I said you could amass an army and take
[18:16] over a city rather than a brother
[18:20] offended you know brother Brown told us
[18:22] and this is something we don't do
[18:24] if you think a brother's got all against
[18:26] you you don't you don't wait for him you
[18:29] gotta you're supposed to go you're
[18:31] supposed to go to him that's right
[18:33] you're not supposed to wait and say well
[18:35] if he's got something if he's got
[18:37] something against me he can just come
[18:38] tell me about it no the scripture says
[18:40] and the brother round teaches that we
[18:42] supposed to go to that person and say
[18:45] hey you got something against me because
[18:46] what you got to do is get it off your
[18:47] tip so hey you got something against me
[18:50] brother and if he says no see the net
[18:51] Heat's all up on him
[18:53] you're done it Heats all up on him if he
[18:56] says no I ain't got no problem but he
[18:57] really does have a problem
[18:59] so if you think somebody's got a problem
[19:03] why I'm saying
[19:10] undies and I'm not saying this because
[19:12] of sister Dale no yeah
[19:15] no I'm saying this because of a brother
[19:19] he's not coming to church because he got
[19:21] offended somebody made a fun of how he
[19:25] dresses
[19:26] so I thought people be very careful how
[19:29] you treat people don't make wire of some
[19:32] somebody because what hurts you may not
[19:35] hurt somebody else and we'll have
[19:37] somebody else I'm gonna hurt you and you
[19:39] know we're trying to bring him back but
[19:41] people be careful how you treat other
[19:42] people that's right yeah just something
[19:45] small like that somebody come to church
[19:47] hey that's a stumbling block you know
[19:49] what if you stumble and fall I don't
[19:50] care if the Block's Empire or this high
[19:52] if you stumble and fall it hurts whether
[19:55] you're stumble on a little one or
[19:57] just to remember I was just
[20:04] be quit going to church because his life
[20:06] was better than it was a stumbling sure
[20:09] it was a stumbling block that's what it
[20:10] was he saw those deacons That was
[20:13] supposed to be exemplary deacons and
[20:15] this was in the 60s
[20:17] and he's all there everyday life
[20:20] was not good
[20:22] so that was a stumbling block
[20:24] that handled somebody so I agree with
[20:27] with um
[20:29] we say things in Jess sometimes but
[20:31] sometimes you know maybe let's hone this
[20:32] thing down to where we you know we don't
[20:34] have to be we don't have to walk in and
[20:36] be like zombies and just sit here you
[20:37] know and no you can
[20:40] use your personality
[20:42] but try not to use your personality in a
[20:44] hurtful way even though you might not
[20:46] think it's hurtful you know just hey if
[20:49] it's somebody brother wants to dress in
[20:50] a
[20:51] well I have a problem with the pink
[20:53] shirt and a pink tie all the time but
[20:54] let's do something else but you know if
[20:57] if they dress different so what as long
[20:59] as they're within the I mean your
[21:01] sisters look at the color difference
[21:04] look at the color difference of the of
[21:06] the what you wear mom likes flowers
[21:10] some others don't well just because she
[21:11] like flowers doesn't make her
[21:13] the devil and you God you know that's
[21:16] just human nature that's just human
[21:18] things that's just human but
[21:21] don't go off it's nice to tell somebody
[21:23] else unless it's provocative or unless
[21:26] it's not within the line of the of the
[21:28] message in the hour yeah but yeah right
[21:31] yeah
[21:39] these shirts and purple pants is okay
[21:42] well actually this brother was he just
[21:45] needs to get him a purple dress purple
[21:46] and pink tie to go with him he's over
[21:48] dressed it's not like he wore weird
[21:50] colors oh I did drinks and somebody and
[21:54] he spelled well if I dress up to go
[21:57] somewhere I should dress up to go to the
[21:59] house of God brother Brown said wear
[22:01] your best for Sunday wear your best now
[22:05] you don't have to look
[22:07] but I'm not hearing jeans and a t-shirt
[22:09] right I wear jeans on Wednesday night
[22:12] but you know what brother they'll see
[22:13] quit doing it I quit doing it if he's
[22:15] comfortable with it then I'm comfortable
[22:17] with it because he wears jeans he worse
[22:20] crops one night on Wednesday night you
[22:21] know
[22:22] his toes wasn't showing
[22:26] yeah I don't talk
[22:28] but see we get we get into that but but
[22:31] if we're within the light of the message
[22:33] of the hour
[22:36] so what big deal I don't care doesn't
[22:38] matter to me I don't you know we got
[22:40] some preachers in the message and we'll
[22:41] stop right here because I want to get to
[22:42] a point and we'll finish in a few
[22:44] minutes we got some people in the
[22:45] message some preachers in the message
[22:47] are Pastors in the message they don't
[22:49] let their sisters wear it won't does not
[22:51] want them to wear up
[22:53] they want them long
[22:55] if I want a big deal
[22:58] I mean he makes that a Doctrine in his
[23:00] church that his sisters have to wear
[23:01] their hand their hair like sister Gwen
[23:03] not like sister Jim
[23:05] to me there's no difference
[23:09] the only problem I ever got with it
[23:13] is if your hair is like assistant wins
[23:14] or anybody that wears as long
[23:17] you go in there and start working with
[23:19] food please put your hair up at least do
[23:23] something with it braid it Danny
[23:28] because it doesn't bother me though
[23:31] I'd rather have a hair this long in my
[23:33] food than one this long if you
[23:35] understand
[23:38] I'd rather have one
[23:41] have one from up here
[23:43] I had one stuck around the button the
[23:46] other day and I kept pulling that thing
[23:47] and pulling that thing and it was way
[23:49] down here
[23:52] that's okay
[23:57] I've seen that's just that's just that's
[24:00] not a doctoral issue though you don't
[24:02] say well sister you're going to hell
[24:03] because you wear your hair down like
[24:05] that's Gwen over here
[24:08] but but I do believe in being modest I
[24:12] do believe in the Bible says wearing
[24:14] modest apparel everywhere you go
[24:17] that's like Danny said one time he said
[24:19] you know you you dress up you go to
[24:21] church and you dress up you go to town
[24:22] you dress up you go to work and then
[24:24] your husband sees you and
[24:26] amen and a uh
[24:30] nightgown how many housecoat and fuzzy
[24:35] slippers all the time I don't agree with
[24:37] that
[24:39] I just don't see that do I I don't
[24:42] either thank you mother Danny
[24:45] but listen the whole thing of this we
[24:47] laugh about if we want to but we have to
[24:50] live an exemplary life if our life is as
[24:53] common as a world out here and and you
[24:55] can't tell the difference between me
[24:58] in my walk and my talk if you if you
[25:00] walk with me brother I said I walk in a
[25:03] man's office and tell him tell what what
[25:05] his desires are right okay so if you so
[25:09] then it must have something to do with
[25:10] your environment right that you create
[25:12] that you create whether you have you
[25:16] know
[25:17] music on that shouldn't be I know we
[25:19] work in some of you working offices
[25:21] where you can't control the music that's
[25:23] okay you just tune that stuff out but if
[25:25] you're in control of a situation and
[25:27] that's what you feed on then I would be
[25:29] I go to the altar I try to get rid of
[25:32] that thing same way with your clothes
[25:34] and same way with you know all of our we
[25:37] should be where everybody should know
[25:39] that we're Christians that we're
[25:40] different not even just like a nominal
[25:42] Christian I mean but we've got to be
[25:43] above that nominal Christian
[25:45] because a nominal Christian just knows
[25:46] what they know and that's it
[25:48] and that's basic even talking about what
[25:51] we're talking about now a nominal
[25:52] Christian wouldn't wouldn't even listen
[25:53] to you
[25:54] because about our hair and our dress and
[25:56] stuff like that because they don't deal
[25:57] with that stuff
[25:58] but that's why that brother Brown had to
[26:00] come and preach that
[26:02] to get a start toward the area of lining
[26:05] up and so that that when we walk through
[26:07] the you know through the Walmart or
[26:09] through work through the world
[26:12] they say man that's different or even
[26:14] like brother Joe see brother Joe nobody
[26:16] is probably ever sees that but that
[26:18] thing's on a video camera somewhere
[26:20] maybe
[26:21] and the head boss you never know and the
[26:24] head boss sees him throw that away on a
[26:26] security camera
[26:29] that's a wonderful man well if there is
[26:31] a situation comes up
[26:33] that maybe brother Joe let's just say he
[26:35] runs into one of the light poles out in
[26:37] the parking lot and it bends it over
[26:39] the guy's going to be a lot more lenient
[26:41] on brother Joe because of the things
[26:43] that he does because we're humans we
[26:45] make mistakes
[26:46] that's a human mistake
[26:49] but in light of but now if he would see
[26:51] brother Joe on a camera
[26:53] he don't smoke but now I'm throwing a
[26:56] cigarette butt down or drinking coffee
[26:57] and throwing the cup down he would ask
[26:59] that company never to come back his
[27:01] right well see bro Joe would then either
[27:03] lose his job or the company would lose
[27:04] something everything's connected people
[27:06] everything is connected whether you do
[27:09] this or everything is connected and if
[27:12] you do if you are in a worker day world
[27:14] with as many cameras that are out now
[27:17] you better do things right and you know
[27:19] what no it's on it's on it's a witness
[27:21] camera
[27:21] it's a witness right and like I said
[27:23] brother Joe you do or anybody you do
[27:25] something wrong an employer or a
[27:28] customer or a vendor is going to be much
[27:30] more settled hey it's just a human
[27:33] mistake but if he sees bro Joe just kick
[27:36] that pilot out of the way or throw down
[27:37] a coffee cup or he may kick him out but
[27:42] if you see him do the right thing
[27:43] he said hey this is your human being
[27:45] he's trying to do a good job he's just
[27:47] making a mistake and that's what I want
[27:48] us to uh you know we we got the message
[27:51] of the hour we've got all the quotes we
[27:52] got everything we need but if the
[27:54] brother around says we're missing and
[27:56] missing it in the walk that's right
[27:59] and we're missing it missing it and
[28:01] leave us a sermon
[28:02] then that's what we need to start
[28:04] working on
[28:06] I mean if we but if we do get that then
[28:08] that's a good foundation that's right
[28:09] there Faith Foundation don't forget your
[28:11] foundation let's work on putting all
[28:13] these other virtues and letting them do
[28:15] this with God instead of just having
[28:16] human nature virtues
[28:18] to do right there are people that do
[28:20] right just by human nature they're just
[28:22] they just do right maybe they were
[28:23] brought up right
[28:24] but if you take that though and you can
[28:26] take somebody that's brought up wrong
[28:29] take the new birth
[28:31] it's got to go back to right
[28:34] it's got to go back to right so if we
[28:35] take that and put them two together and
[28:37] I think that's what God wants us to do
[28:39] he wants us to walk as a human
[28:42] but walk is a Godly human
[28:44] because you can be
[28:45] you can be you can be a Godly human and
[28:48] a human at the same time because you got
[28:50] God in you and in what God projects from
[28:52] here like we read the belly out of the
[28:54] belly
[28:55] flows right rivers and water whether
[28:58] it's good or bad
[29:00] everything proceedeth out of the
[29:01] mountain so keep those things in mind
[29:03] we'll talk about a little bit more next
[29:04] couple of Sundays and then we'll start
[29:06] on
[29:07] statue of a perfect man thank you
[29:09] brother Tom Ernest he'll be here on
[29:11] Wednesday night with us goodbye
[29:14] yeah we got something guys this
[29:17] afternoon
[29:24] he'll do Jeff is fine
