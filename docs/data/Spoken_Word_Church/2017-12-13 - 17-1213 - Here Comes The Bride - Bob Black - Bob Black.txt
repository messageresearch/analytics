let's go ahead and turn over in your scripture to Genesis chapter 24 and I did talk to brother Lewis earlier and he said he they'll be trying to stream in from Fort Lauderdale so they're taking a little pit stop on the way down one of those you know where you switch planes and all that stuff it's good to be in the house of the Lord I was telling somebody you know you kind of look at all of the things that are happening these days and all the although you know all the people that have come out and the Hollywood and everything they have done all kinds of horrible things and it's getting in the news and it feels like manifesting time because the things that have been done in secret and now being made known everything all around and all walks of life the different groups of people are being kind of pulled together and and separated and it looks like people are being set aside and some grouped here and some group there and I know that sounds kind of like a little riddle but well that thing things are happening I believe and so too tonight I just maybe not not speak too long I don't I don't know how but long this will go but as the Lord leads I just want to take this little scripture from Genesis chapter 24 and the brothers in the back if you just kind of keep Genesis chapter 24 we're gonna just kind of read through that whole chapter and and look at some things here tonight so let's just cover the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we're just so thankful to be able to gather together around your word Lord Jesus and to be able to look into the promises that you made that you prepared for us before the foundation of the world and I pray Lord that you'll just open up these mysteries to us tonight Lord Jesus help us Lord to be able to see more of what our part is and who we are Lord that you'll open the eyes of our heart Lord Jesus to see you as song we sing Lord I saw all of our prayer tonight or DS Asst Lord as we look into the word Lord what service would it be Lord if you weren't here Lord and so Lord we just invite you to come and make your abode with us tonight we open the door of our hearts Lord the door of the church Lord that you'll feel welcome and be able to come in and set among us oh Jesus Lord and granted I pray Lord that you'll just make this word come alive to us that it won't be in vain as we gather here tonight Lord but Lord Jesus that you'll help us Lord Jesus to know you more we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm just gonna take my coat off and you're supposed to ask permission right is it all right if I take my coat not too much reading tonight Genesis chapter 24 verse 62 to 63 and Isaac came from the way of the well Lahaie La Hire OE for he dwelt in the South Country and Isaac went out to meditate in the field of the Eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming you may be seated so I you know with all of the different things that are kind of happening today and you know you many times ministers will say things look bleak and and so forth and you know out west a a lot of the people that I work with I work with a couple of people in their way at work in California and they talked about the wildfires that are near near the office that we have out there and and then you see things that people are posting online about the different fires around Los Angeles and somebody said that it looks like like hail had arisen and and you know the pictures that people are posting it it does look very hellish different earthquakes all around the world and things that are taking place but you know I believe that the reason a lot of these things are taking places is it's not just that there's a cause for it and and what's happening is that God is is preparing his bride and it is bride is coming together and it's the bride is maturing and realize who she is and and and it's kind of is something secret is taking place you know you you even you know to be honest and many of the ranks and the message I think many people fail to really see what's happening and and so I want to take maybe for a little topic tonight here comes the bride because you know that this little story that we're looking at Isaac looked out across the field at Eventide at the evening time and he looked out across the field and he saw the camels were coming when the camels were carrying his bride and you know you can look at all of these different things and they signify that something is taking place and I believe the bride is coming and maybe they're not I don't want to speak maybe in the future tense I think we've we've talked in the future tense for so long but now the hour is that the bride that is has come it's a present tense theme the bride is is where she needs to be I believe she's recognizing her position she's recognizing who she is and that's really one of the things I want to convey tonight is who do we say the bride is and I think you know sometimes you know you get up behind the pulpit and many times the things kind of like what I might talk about tonight or is something you almost feel pressure not to just straight up say things because it's it's it's hard to believe who the bride he is who the bride really is and and so maybe I just want to kind of lay it out there tonight yet the Lord will help me but you know think about that song that they sing at weddings and everything here comes the bride here comes the bride and the bride comes marching down the aisle and maybe just think about that that the the situation that's set up there all the different things that are done in a wedding and and are prepared in a certain way that that really they speak to something that a traditional wedding now I'm not speaking of like one of these modern weddings where everything is going haywire but in a real true traditional wedding where the bride comes down dressed in white why does she dressed in white and you know somebody has told her out how to walk and instructed her the white right way to present herself and and and how all of those things should be done and she comes down and she's got the veil over her face and then she comes up and she's presented to the groom and he you know you look at a lot of weddings and as the bride's walking down the aisle the groom might be thinking to himself well you know I'm not so sure I should be doing this and maybe he's having second thoughts and all of those things but in a real prepared situation where the groom has prayed about it and he's put thought into it when he when he sees his bride coming down the aisle he sees the one that that is gonna make him complete that she matches him she is going back to the to the original groom and bride and the and the Garden of Eden they she was born of his bone and flesh of his flesh he was a perfect match so when when a groom a real somebody that's really prayed and and and and it has been seeking a bride when he sees her coming down the aisle it's a very happy time and she's turned over to him and she she's got that veil over her face which signifies something she lifts it and and they go through the all the ceremony and entered in and and join them in the in the Bible way and say all the different things and then you know they turn and they present the bride the minister does presents the bride and the groom to the people and you know the traditional way a lot that all these modern things out they'll say differ both other names and all that kind of stuff but their traditional way is to present them mr. and mrs. and the name of that groom and not in two different names but they now they've got that same name and you know the the name the name represents it represents the characteristics it identifies who that person he is the name is what that person is all about you know we talked about in the Garden of Eden and when the Spirit of the Lord came upon Adam and he began to name all the different animals and those things he was naming them based on the spirit of god was quickening in him to give them a name based on what their characteristics were he gave that lamb the name of the of a lamb because it had a characteristic it was what what his nature was it produced wool and it was very meek and all of those different things and all the different animals that you could go through they had a characteristic about them and so that name that was put on them to show what it was and so on a groom when a bride and a groom are joined together she takes on his name because now she's got the same characteristics as him we're kind of mixing the natural the spiritual a little bit I know because a lot of times in the natural the the bride doesn't really have that any anything close to the same characteristics as as the husband a lot of times they're not really quite United and everything they have problems and everything but we're talking to spiritual and you know when when Isaac wanted a wife she was she was off down and in the land of mesopotamia often the Fertile Crescent worshiping idols and everything and so he he sent a messenger Abraham did to go get her out of that condition and though she was all her life was you know and kind of and not and not in a state where it would be suitable for her to marry such a man that had been had been raised up in a god-fearing household and everything but yet yet she was brought from that condition into a place where she could be presented to him and she would be worthy and I think that's where God what God is doing for us in this out what he's been doing for the last 40 50 however many years and so many of our lives he's brought us from the land of Egypt brought us through the wilderness through the valley of the sin all of those different things until now we're entering into the Promised Land so let's read a little bit from Genesis chapter 24 try not to start leaking here let's start at verse one if y'all want to pull that up Genesis chapter 24 verse 1 and we just kind of want to just take our time and just meditate on some of the things in this in this little chapter because we've got we've kind of got a scene that you know these are types and it's it's very hard for a type is not the thing so it's hard for you to see all of the things that make up the thing in the title if that makes sense there's a lot of things going on for example you could not fully see all of the different attributes that make up Malachi 4 or 5 6 in in Eleazar but you know it takes a lot of different types and things in the Old Testament to kind of put together that picture where you can see that of what what kind of nature what kind of person this this hour Eleazar would be well you've got the stories and an ester with it mimicking the Sabbath and all the de chambers and all the different things you've got this different stories of Elijah and Elijah and all those so it all comes together to create a great big tapestry of what God is doing and Abraham was old and well streaking an agent and the Lord had blessed Abraham and all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that rule over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord the God of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell you know I think that's a good lesson for us all all of us you know we teach our children that you want to find a good because of what I just said you want to find somebody that's a match for you and you don't you don't want to find somebody that's gonna give you a lot of grief and everything so we want the very best for our children and so but you know I we were listening on the way to church tonight we were listening to the choosing of a bride and I I think a lot of times in our kind of devotional we kind of stop it at that and make the choosing of a bride all these deep deep kind of sermons that brother Branham talked about just a little life lesson but what brother Branham was really speaking of was so much deeper than just just a little good a good little lesson to help you run your house and everything he's speaking of of what of who we are and I will make thee swear by the Lord the God of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife under my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I Boyle but thou shalt go into my country and to my kindred and take a wife under my son Isaac and we know that this is speaking of he had to find somebody that was kinship to him somebody that was related to you know and the only way that we could be related to him is he puts his own life inside of us right and so that's one of the things where I can I was speaking of earlier that it's difficult to take a type and apply it perfectly because it doesn't it is a little bit fuzzy there if you're just gonna look at the type exactly but he he's gay he wants to find a good relation and and so he makes us related to him not by your natural birth not by the way you came into the world from your mama and daddy but through a spiritual birth by putting by you receiving his word and and he comes in quickens his word and makes it alive in you I know that's kind of a little rehash of some things but you know it's good to rehash sometimes and the service said unto Him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me under this land must I knees bring thy son again under the land from whence thou camest and Abraham said unto Him beware that I bring not my son thither again the Lord God of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and I swear unto me saying under thy seed will I give this land he shall send His angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife under my son from thence so here we've got Isaac the promised son the one that had God had promised Abraham when he said I don't have anybody to take my inheritance I don't have anybody to leave all the things that you've promised to him there wouldn't that be an interesting predicament for for God to leave Abraham in where he had given him all of the land and all of those different things and all that made all those promises to him and then when Abraham died know what nobody to have it so of course he made that promise to Abraham that he wouldn't just give it to Eliezer the servant but he would he would his inheritance will be given the one that would come from his loins so how from his loins came Isaac and and one day we know with all of the different stories Isaac was he went through the the kind of the same types that that Jesus went through how he was offered up as a lamb on the on the sacrifice and that story of Jehovah Jireh that God will provide himself a sacrifice and and so Abraham turning to saw the sacrifice there and they were able to offer it up but you know Isaac went up to that altar willingly and laid his life down a willing sacrifice and so it's just a perfect type of Christ about how Christ gave himself on the cross and laid himself down so that so that really so that you could come forth because if he had not died done that then then this great mystery that's been hidden from ages and ages can never have come to be so as as Jesus was dying on the cross giving his life you know you think about when somebody if somebody were to pay for something somebody to give you a quarter for a loaf of bread or whatever then then they're given that quarter but they're giving it for something that that thing that they're buying has value and that thing you think about Jesus's blood dripping off of the cross that that blood was paying the price for something what was it paying for it was paying it for you you know sometimes I think the devil tries to get us all down and out and because it he makes you think that because you're going through trials and troubles and everything that you're you're not a good Christian that you're no longer worthy of these things but God paid the price he paid it with his own blood and he paid it because he knew that you had value to him you were you had you were more valuable to him than his blood was and that's that's kind of a big statement to him you were more but you had more value to him than his blood otherwise he wasn't he giving it away he gave it away on the cross and watched it drip down and so they took him in and they and they took his body and they laid him in the grave and they and you know they sealed it up and we you make all the all the stories about how the Roman dog might sealed it up and they they sealed up that grave so that nobody knew whether he was in there not and all those different things and the disciples were running around afraid and then and then that life came into that body and busted out of that out of that tomb so that to prove that that he was he was resurrected and they looked inside and they they searched and they couldn't find his body and when you know all the stories about how Mary came and looking for it and she thought she found the somebody that she thought was a gardener and and along and along make a long story short a very long story short he he went away and as he was going away he has sent it into a cloud the Bible says and he says in the same way that you see me going and this manner that you'll see me coming back and so you know this kind of sets everything up in the same way that this story of Isaac was set up because Isaac was not where his bride was he was away he had to leave the earth you know you know God kind of sets up everything in this way for a reason so that in each tip sensation there's another group on the earth and I believe he does that so there so we're not gonna get confused about what's happening as each thing takes place God Jesus Christ leaves the earth so now what's happening now what's happening his life comes back and lives inside of the believers and now is his bride on the earth and then you know you keep going down to the different dispensations Elijah comes on the earth God is speaking the voice of God in this man Elijah and he's speaking but then Elijah goes off the earth and you see different things taking place because you know that that the last time for the Lewis priest he read that that quote about how brother Brennan was said in the voice of the sign it was the the last of the four messages of the horses a sign during the prayer line brother Anna speaks that there's got to be somebody on earth to be the voice of God all the time there's got to be somebody on earth and you know I think sometimes I can be a little bit confusing what what is the voice of God you know program said the voice of God is is word if and so if it's not necessarily a particular person that has the voice of God we needed a person to come and give us the voice of God but once you hear that voice of God and you receive it and then that word becomes mature in you and you're saying the exact same thing exact same thing to that that that prophet said the exact same thing that all the prophets before him said and it meshes completely in the Bible and you can run it all the way through then you to have the voice of God it doesn't matter if you're a little a little washerwoman a little somebody out on the street that barely knows their ABCs you know you could you can be helped so much by a little washer woman sitting on her on her front porch in a rocking chair and you go up to here and sometimes she more know about God she'll know more about God and then a lot of people that are behind the pulpit because it doesn't matter necessarily what the you know a donkey could be the voice of God could be in a donkey as it was the Balaam it doesn't matter necessarily the vessel but what matters is the word and I believe that that were serving a god that that he's behind his word you know no man's the the voice of any man is gonna be their word so God is backing his word if he said it he's going to make it come to pass you know that that really kind of struck me the other day I was kind of meditating on that and and you know that God had got us framed the world by his word he spoke the word and the worlds were framed into existence and not just this world but all the universe and all the things you look up into the night sky and see all the different stars twinkling and everything and then all from that great vastness and then come right down to your fingernail and all the little things that make up your body and all those different things he he framed all of that by his word and so we're we're not serving a God where it's just a theological concept and everything but it's it's a God where there's actually power behind these words to change your life to change the power of transformation to take a sinner and turn them into a saint to take somebody that doesn't know anything about God and take turn them into a mature Christian to take you to take a hold of somebody that's called up in the world and and bound by alcohol and drugs and yeah who knows what else and transform them into it somebody's where God is tabernacled inside of them and so that's what I mean by when I say that here comes the bride because he's done that he's doing that now he's doing that for us all of us sitting here he's taking us and molded us and and and put us on the back of these camels and moving us down through history truth through time until we've come to a place where what we're waiting on next is the body change so if we just keep reading through this little chapter we get to a place where we're where this little special man was sent for this to get this bride for Isaac to get her and and take her back to him and you know I think it's it's moving us to kind of dwell on this for just a little bit and just this chapter 24 13 through 14 says [Music] that where I am yeah I'm just gonna skip down there because what what Isaac does is or what Abraham does is he sends a man after Isaac a type of what's happening in this day where after all of the seven church ages has passed and God sends a man to to man down to us to get the bride ready to polish everything up now now I'm gonna take a little liberties here and also type Eliezer is not just brother branham in this last day but also all of the all of the ones that have gone all down through the seven churches Paul and Irina's and Martin Colombo Luther all the ones that have been sent to get a bride ready in their day also because you know I think sometimes we we kind of get a little mistaken idea that the bride's only couldn't come out of this last day the bride's got to come out of the the wheat plant comes out of all the different ages you can't forget about the other ones you can't forget about all you can't forget about the feet and the leg and the knees and all the ones that all the other body parts because what what body what kind of body would it be if it only had a head but it's got to have the whole thing and they without us could not be made perfect it's all of it comes together into a great big tapestry and so there is a Eliezer he came to the well and he's asking the Lord Lord God of Israel to help him find the right one to lead him and guide him to get the right one and that she'll respond well and that the right one will that heal the right one will be identified and so he says behold I stand here by the will of water and verse 13 and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down that picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed before thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master and you know so so there he's laying it out before God that this little pattern and the pattern is that he's gonna say something and she's gonna respond and I like that because you see that's what's happening today on the tapes the voice of God says something and you should respond you gotta say something to as a minister behind the Pope is saying something and you got to respond you got to make a choice you can either have to say I believe that that's right or well I don't know but I'll go back and look at it some more I'll go study a little bit deeper or you just outright reject it which is not what we want to do if it's the true Word of God and so you know this the same little pattern has as repeated and lots of other little stories through Scripture and you know I think one of these little things that God is showing to us now is that is that these little women that the Bible talks about Rahab and the widow woman that Elijah went to and the Shunammite woman and the woman at the well the reason all these little special women were put in there is because there are types of the bride responding to this to this gospel call the gospel call is calling him out and they they respond and so that a special person is sent to each of these little ladies and they respond and in the way that the each of them do and they're different stories so Eliezer we talked about earlier that Eliezer was he he originally was gonna be the inheritor of all of the things all of the property but so you know that kind of makes him a very special person because he could have he could have inherited everything just by himself but he laid down his life really he gave his whole life over so that so that Isaac could have a bride you know I think that's one thing that kind of befuddles us today so many of us says we think that everything is all wrapped up in our Eliezer that Eliezer inherits everything our eyes are so stuck on Eliezer that we can't see past eleazar eleazar doesn't get everything now he gets everything as far as you know being part of the bride and joint-heirs with Christ and all that kind of thing he's part of the plan that's not what I mean but but we we need to go a little step beyond that and look at see what Eliezer came for he came to bring a message to catch a bride the bride is the is the purpose of what his message was about and so in this little story of Eliezer he was on a divine mission God sent an angel ahead of him he had an angel with him and he had supreme confidence from his master that he was going to do the right thing that he would follow the leading of the Lord to get a bride for Isaac that that he would bring a wife back to Abraham's inheritance and so Abraham was had confidence in him that he would play his role and that God would move upon the scene to have a wife answer back a young little lady that had been set apart so let's keep reading just this 24 1517 I clocked moving faster than I thought it would and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold Rebekah came out who was born to bethe UL son of Milcah the wife of Nahor Abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder you know I think that's interesting that this little story takes place at a well and it ends at a will because Isaac was coming by the will of a high high high ROI and he was coming through from that well and you know this kind of parallels another little story that we've heard about where there was another woman at the well and she was she was coming at to the well because I well was a gathering place where they come to get something to drink and she Jesus it ended up with her saying I want something I want some of this water that you're talking about that you're drinking of and so in this story Eliezer met this woman at this well because he was offering her something as well he was offering her to be part of Isaac's life it is so amazing how God does those types of little things he sets everything up so that you see these little interesting things being played out and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said let me I pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink and when she had done giving him drinks she said I would draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking and so she's doing the same thing that this little widow of Zarephath did when Elijah said first give me first give me something to eat she's offering a making an offering our first first herself she's putting others before so you can see all of these little types being played out where she responds in the in the correct way and so you know what what Eliezer is really doing is he's he's making that Gospel call to get her dressed up right so that he can present her to Isaac so that he can show her and and get her prepared what he's really doing is he's offering her an invitation to worship because you know you see that in God's provided place of worship brother Branham laid out all of the different places all of the different patterns of getting some money to worship and he ends up with where is it where is God has provided place of worship God has provided place of worship is in Christ and if you can get in Christ he's the door he's the way you could get into him and you have the right way of worship and get into his word but really summing it all up the all these different types and things that that God laid out in the Old Testament of the the blood over the little of the door and that in in Egypt and the the tabernacle that they built in the wilderness all of those were think speaking of God in dwelling inside of you that's what God wants to do he wants to dwell inside of the people get himself inside of you so that he can be Lord of you get himself so that he's tabernacling himself inside of you and then you're worshiping God in the right way you don't know how to worship without God inside of you to guide you to we need a guide like that story that brother I'm told about how when he got lost in the wilderness and he he needed a guide because he thought he knew the way home he thought he knew how to get back and he reached his hand up and said Lord I need you to put my hand on the guide without that guide you don't even know how right with the right approaches while you'll think that you're saved by the things that you do by the things that that you just because you go to church because you do different things but you're what you're what you do is you're saved by the word that you've you've held that you you receive the word and you eat it and you hang on to it so what what God's great mystery that was well sealed up when Jesus was down in that grave was sealed up that God was trying to has been hidden God's great mystery is that God has a bride and his bride has to be revealed so he he Abraham sent that little that little we'll call it a type of a prophet Eliezer down to get a bride for Isaac to as a type of God calling us calling us to worship to a true worshiper his provided place of worship so that we are dwelling with him in communion and in the experience of the new birth so let's keep on reading and I'm Iver honestly I'm not I'm not gonna take up too much much more time and let's see Genesis 24 55 to 59 I'm just gonna kind of skip down a little bit and just kind of read cuz you know you either Eliezer went and he began to speak to to Rebecca's family and begin to talk to them about how God had Abraham had sent him and all of the different things that had happened how he laid it before the Lord how he wanted to her to you know offer to water his camels and all those different things and so they you know her dad and her her granddad they said well this is this is definitely a leading of the Lord and so they began to have this conversation at Genesis 24 15 chapter verse 55 and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days and at the least 10 after that she shall go and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the Lord hath prospered my way he send me away that I may go to my master hey you know so many of us in our in our journeys we've been hindered by things that others have said to us you know brother Brown talked about how we need to get our flus unstopped and our flus run stop because of life and because of sin and all those different things somebody's told you something somebody's told you you can't be saved somebody's told you you you're not going to go in the rapture because your birth and all those different things and here we've got brother Branham explained that her brother had kind of types her you know you know maybe a preacher and her mother types that denominational system that came out of and all those different kind of things just kind of bind us up together you know you can get bound up by different preachers and you know today you you look around and people people have been so bound up by preachers that are not preaching to any kind of word or preaching false doctrine that now many people have completely lost all confidence in preachers but you know like Elijah when he wondered if there was even at 7,000 that was still serving the Lord there still if there's if there's false preachers there's still true preachers and and you know that really the difference between a false and the true is a false we'll try to keep that veil on your eyes and I believe a true preacher will try to lift the veil because it's not that preacher is God in the preacher lift lifting the veil over to cause you to realize who you who you are and to realize that God's Word is true and that God can save you and justify you and sanctify you and keep you sanctified and keep you saved that there's power in the gospel that he's able to do it but you know the false preached the false doctrine will bind you and make you think that there's nothing real going on and all those kind of things and so so she came out of this this system where where she heard maybe maybe her brother a false doctrine she heard her mother saying don't go with them let's just kind of stay back stay back in this system but yet she made a decision contrary to all the stuff that she was here and there and accepted the word of the Lord through this little Eliezer and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the Lord hath prospered my ways send me away that I may go to my master and they said we will call a damsel and inquire at her mouth now that's kind of striking because she gotta say something she's got a speech she's got to say I am gonna go and that's the way that your whole your whole Christian experience is based upon your confession right he's the high priest of our confession you've got to speak it and you know it's not alright just for you to you know didn't Jesus say if you if if you testify me in front of others and I know I'm a little paraphrasing a little bit because I frankly I can't require remember exactly but then I won't if you're not ashamed of me in front of others and I'm not gonna be ashamed of you before the Father and so we've got to testify we've got to confess and cause a confession will lead our life just like David when he went down there to fight Goliath we know that story and he said I'm a I'm gonna cut your head off and you know because he believed God's Word he believed it and and so he he kept marching forward reading God's Word understanding it confessing it speaking it speaking it and going forward and they called Rebecca and said under her wilt thou go with this man and she said I will go and they sent away because see then when you make a confession that's when you get set apart from everybody that's when they sent her away is when she began to speak what God had said about her and I know I'm kind of adding a little bit to the time it doesn't say that she said what God said about her but that's what we're doing in this day as we're reading what God says in the Bible we're listening to what the tapes say we're listening to different ministers and were confessing I believe that you know if we really believe what confessing was about I think that might that would change the way we talk in the parking lot and talk amongst on the phone and everything because your confession is gonna is gonna pull you alone speak it speak and go forward why cry speak and so and then the next little verse that says and Rebecca rose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and follow the man and the servant took Rebecca and went his way and so she got the back of these camels that we were talking about earlier that you Isaac could look out and see her coming on the camels hey how did she ride on these camels III think these camels speak of something that's happening in our own lives because you know first of all she watered those camels and brother Brown type that he said she watered the camels that were going to take her to her destination you know in this story she watered them at the beginning of the journey but I believe in our journey we're watering them every day of our life we're watering them because we're we we have to you know we really we have to bring the holy spirit in us we have to bring it the word and so we're we keep bringing it the word you've got to eat you got to go to church you got to do all those things and what really what what more can a Christian do is then eat you know we say we say all these different things about praying and fasting and all that kind of stuff but really it all bottles down into just faith you believe you're a Christian and you know like if you go to the zoo and you'll see all of these all these different animals you see a zebra with stripes on its back and what makes that a zebra have stripes on his back it's not doing anything it's not really struggling with in itself to squeeze those stripes out all that's doing is going up to the trough and putting his head in there and eating it eats and it eats and it eats and that's what a believer does that's what a Lamb of God does that's what an eagle does is it where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered together why because that's what the eagle does is it eats and eats and eats and I think that's where a lot of us have fallen short and this day we we haven't eaten a lot and and so now you you look around across the land and many are finding out that they haven't been eating and so they say well you know I believe the revelation of the hour is that we should be eating and and I would say to you that that sounds a little bit foolish to me that sounds a little bit worrisome do you know because in and the Bible talks about a people that were right there right about the time of the rapture when they would begin to see the bride coming into maturity coming into a place where she knows who she ours who she is and everything she would begin to look back and say do you mean that I'm supposed to have all in my lamp all this time I was supposed to have all and and and do you mean that I was supposed to be listening to the tapes all this time I'm sorry to spoil it for you but the revelation of the hour is not that you should be listening to the tape so you don't have to tell the bride to listen to tapes the bride's gonna be eating you didn't have to tell Rebecca to water the camels Rebecca water that Keller's the first thing she did and and we are water we've been watering the camels all along until is produce something that I would say that that now you can look back and you can know where you are and who you are I believe it's this is the hour of knowing this is an hour of knowing who you are that knowing that that you you have been redeemed that you've been brought out of the world brought out all these things and that that thing that holy thing that's living inside of you is the Holy Ghost and that's what's been keeping you you know I think in brief even brother brother Brown told about that story of sister Sheppard where what she wasn't quiet she didn't quite understand what the new birth was and so she you know she laid on her couch and she had that dream of the stands for a perfect man and after that brother Brennan preached the statue of a perfect man and explain how you have to come through a growth process and all those different things I believe that's what many have been struggling for years with knowing exactly what the new birth is and you know if I can give my own explanation of what the new birth is this the life of Christ living his in you and identifying you with his word and manifesting his characteristics and his attributes in your life and that's that's that's what it is and so now we're in a place where we know what the new birth is and whether or not we have it because we've been eating we've been eating and watering the word watering those cameras what are the camels brother Bram said those camels represent power that was the power that was carrying her to her destination and we have a power it's not just the theology it's not just a letter on the page but there's the power of the Holy Ghost that's transporting us to our destination you know there's another woman over in Revelation that said on a scarlet cover beast or near the scarlet beast and and that's that's a different kind of animal that's a different kind of beast a different kind of power a power of a denominational system power of false doctor and false teaching but we have the power of the incorruptible word this true seed of God that's gonna take us from this mortal realm from this fleshly habitat and transform us by by the renewing power of God's Word and of course we know that that Satan's scheme Satan's schema is debar that from taking place he won't he doesn't want you to catch a hold of that revelation of who you are and so he don't want to keep see the wheat plant come to fruition he doesn't want to see this bride mature into who she really isn't so he lets people like her brother and her mother come in and say things try to get you off of the real Word of God that but there's gonna be the bride is gonna stick right with the word she's gonna stay right true to the word and not deviate to the left or the right and so this is the hour of knowing because the same Bible that speaks of him we were talking about Isaac how at types of Christ the same Bible that speaks of seeing him speaks of you and he's got if you can see yourself and him then you see a picture of your perfection because he's already perfect and if you're in him then that makes you perfect as well if you can see how you the role that you play in him then then you begin to you you begin to get somewhere that the world won't like because that's when they begin to stone him was when he began to say I and my father are one and so in John chapter 10 verse 34 it says in Jesus will begin to offer up an explanation for he's manouse ink to stone me and he said they said because you're saying that you're God and so jesus answered them and he said is it not written in your law I said Ye are gods if he called them gods unto whom the Word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken and I'll say that again the scripture cannot be broken the scripture cannot be broken and it called them God say of him of whom the father has sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemous because I said I the son of God and see that's that's that great mystery that's being unfolded is that and just to say it plainly that God Himself is tabernacling himself in the people and all together they make the fullness of the Godhead bodily once they have received the word we receive the word and eating it until all the flues are gone all the fluids are cleared up everything's out of the way and now they begin to realize what their position is and I you know I like I like to you know compare that little story that brother Branham talked about and in the Bible of Elijah and Elijah crossing the River Jordan and and they go through a little journey of going to Bethel and Jericho and and then crossing over the River Jordan all along the way you have the school of prophets interfere and Medlin and everything trying to trying to copycat what Elijah was doing with kind of a theological copycat and you know you can't get it about education it's got to come by a revelation but they were trying to get it by education and so they knew that Elijah was gonna go up and they kept telling a lot Elijah what winds are gonna happen where's you know what's what's taking place and and Elijah kept asking Elijah as they went along through their journey are you gonna leave me now and the largest Elijah said I'm sticking right with you which is the type of us keeping our eyes or I don't crawl on Jesus Christ and so they they crossed over the Jordan and and Elisha watched Elijah as he slapped the water with his robe and and the water parted and he went on the cross in the and and he got caught up in the in the fiery chariot after he had promised him if you see me going up then a double portion will fall back on and so he he he he kept his eyes right on Elijah just as we're keeping our eyes right on Jesus and so he he went he walked back and he got back to the River Jordan and he stood there and and and he and he made that statement which brother Brahim said was not a question it was a statement where is the god of Elijah and you know really you could ask asked that same question today where is the god of a logic you notice he didn't say where is Elijah he didn't say where is Elijah and and you know today speaking earlier about the different the thing where there's different people on earth at different times and you know Jesus Christ is not on earth now and Elijah is not on earth now there's only one that's on earth and that you know one being the Bride of Christ the Bride of Christ is what's on earth now so if you were to say where is the god of Elijah yeah I would say the god of Elijah is in you because that's where that's where the god of Elijah is he's in his people and so when you begin to realize where God is then you become an invincible army because what can do what can the devil do with the people that realizes who their God is and then he's doing great exploits today not in a future chance but in a present tense that he's still Hebrews 13:8 he's this same yesterday and today and forever and I want to emphasize today because so times how many times we put him way off in the future but he's the same today right today in this present time and today God is making himself he has made himself manifested in a bride he has for his fulfilling what was hidden in a mystery all through the ages and you know excuse me you say well well where is that in the Bible where is that in the Bible that that God would have a bride who would be the the incarnation of himself that God will manifest himself and that's in Colossians 1 25 to 29 where the scripture that brother Branham used when he was when he was preaching the seven seals he said wherever I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been here from ages and from generations but now has made manifest to his Saints to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory but i thought the mystery was the mystery of eliezer that one day god will send a prophet and that we would put everything on that profit now you see how why that's hard to preach that is very difficult to priest because that's true that God would send a prophet and he would be the voice of God to this age but but that voice of God was not just sent so that we could rejoice say that God's in a prophet but there was a purpose behind that voice and that purpose was to produce and prepare Brides so that when she marks his down that how she won't look like in that dream that brother Branham had are the people all around the world dancing and doing the or whatever that they didn't he said I almost almost passed out when he looked at them but he wants to present a bride that is how would she be acceptable to God she will have to be exactly delight Jesus Christ she would have to be the same characteristic she will be have to be identified with him she would have to be the the embodiment of everything that God is and that's why she can take his name that's why when she's turned around and presented this is the bride of Jesus Christ she won't have her own name anymore she'll have his name because he'll have the same characteristics the same things everything will just line up perfectly so that that's why in the book of Revelation it says the spirit and the bride say come because now the voice that was in the bridegroom the voice that he sent down in Eleazar is now in the bride and she's able to speak the same thing and how is she able to do this you know and in the Book of Daniel where it talks about the word of the Lord is a rouble that headstone crying grace grace grace grace that's how she's able to do it by grace it's not anything that you've done it's not because how much you've went to church or how much you've done all these different things not that way although you've got to go to church you've got to eat but it's not the works that you've done it's the work of the Holy Spirit in you living out the life of God in you to produce those attributes you're not you're not going to church to be that way you flip it around right you know we that's why it's so precarious to preach a clothesline religion because you've got to present it in a way that that so that you know you know whether you're wrong or not but the right way of living is that God is producing inwardly from the inside outward and what's on the inside produces outwards and that's why at the end of this little story her outward appearance was correct because she came when he said I saw us he Isaac looked and he saw the camels were coming and her presentation was biblically correct because she had her face veiled why was her face veiled because she was coming to her head that's the same way that a woman covers her head she because she wears her long hair because Paul said because your hair is let me find it real quick he said for this calls out the woman to have power on her head because of the angels what a strange scripture power on your head because of the angels because you know that that when you wear your hair long as signifying that you have believed the message for your day you have believed the Angels message whether that's the seven church age as a messenger message or the angel behind the pulpit you have believed it and received it and now you're under headship and so she was coming with that veil over her face showing just like a bride coming to the to the groom and a wedding coming to her head coming to her she was approaching coming to her headship which is Christ let me read this this quote in from Christ as the mystery of God revealed now you can see now and I went longer than I expected but I'll be stopping in just a little bit so don't get too worried I know this is Wednesday night now you can see now the entire message why is rejected now no denomination but the revelation of his mystery see know that I'm nation the revelation God is not known by denomination he is known by revelation look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride oh my God made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the bride and as God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or creed no sir but she is coming back with a pure unadulterated Word of God being manifested and he says I hope every man that hears this tape and every woman will understand that see so God in his bride and so it says and Isaac brought her into his mother in chapter 24 verse 67 Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death became his wife and you know that's another thing that's very difficult to type because we become his wife down here and wife signifies union it's the the bride and the groom coming together in perfect ones and we come in perfect oneness together by eating his word and then we go to the wedding supper will where we'll have communion which types what has taken place down here well we've been communing with him by as he said back there and on the shores of Galilee eat my flesh and drink my blood something that they never understood but now we're able to eat his flesh and drink his blood as he said eating the Word of God and having that quickened by his spirit until it becomes a living reality in his life producing mr. and mrs. Jesus Christ because we take his own name and so that's why I wanted to get to the scripture going back to Psalm 82 chapter 6 to 7 where said I have sinned ye are gods and all of you are children of the Most High but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes you know that's a very word I just oddly worded scripture and if you look kind of at the original Hebrew of these different words it really tells an interesting story and I don't get tired on me now hang on just a few more minutes and I'll wrap up and just shortly I have said Ye are gods and you know that God that word gods ye are gods in this place the underlying word is Elohim ye are elohim that many member Genesis 1:26 27 that brother Wade spent so long trying to explain to us and it get us to see ye are gods and all of you are children of the Most High but ye shall die like me and if you go look at what Hebrew word that is that is the word Adam you shall die like Adam and if you kind of compare that how strange that is to have someone that is both God and man that would die like man and you see how a brother branham explained that that he put a soul into Adam and then he breathed into Adam the breath of eternal life just like he breathed into your eternal life when you heard the word and received and hailed it he breathed into your life and to you into your nostrils the breath of eternal life and that is going to allow you to escape death where Adam died now you can escape death because you know Adam Adam had a sacrifice and that allowed him to keep kind of moving the process keep moving on and we have a sacrifice that we can look to Jesus Christ paid the price for us that his life could come back and live inside of us and he had told he paid the price for our full Redemption soul spirit and body and all we have to do is eat and if you eat and eat and eat then that creates deity in amen and I'll just I'll just end on that note because you know that's a very straightforward thing so I mean about to be honest is something this I suppose would be difficult to preach in many churches that this mystery that God has tabernacled himself in the people that you are deity that God has his manifesting his bride unveiling this mystery that's been sealed for thousands of years and now it's made plain to us how thankful we should be let's just stand to our feet and go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we're so thankful to you tonight Lord God to be able to look into your mysteries and see ourself and see you Lord God and see how everything is put together Lord Lord I believe Lord Jesus many are tired tonight and weary and everything Lord but to mate maybe tomorrow Lord Jesus that you'll just bring everything rushing back Lord God and maybe inspire someone to dig a little bit deeper into the word Lord God to see who we are Lord and I pray God that you'll just bless the remainder of this service Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll help help the people Lord God I want with somebody Lord to see who they are Lord Jesus because there's a there's a pattern to all this we're all kind of lumped in this together that even if one of us comes to adoption we've all got to come to adoption all the ones that are born again before we can get out of here and so we're depending on one another we're depending on one another like the Bible says iron sharpens iron alright we sharpen one another Lord and we're we're all helping one another to grow and grace knowledge to grow in this word so that we can make a body change Lord and I pray Oh God you'll just be with this church be with all the people but brother Dale Lord Jesus and everyone that's present here tonight Lord and just bless the people we pray bless all the ones that are on the road Lord and I pray Lord it's you'll be with brother Lewis Lord and help him that you'll just put exactly the right words in this mouth to speak to bless all of the people down there Lord Lord you'll just help him to be a great blessing Lord and be with him through all of the the troubles and things that come with going to another country and the duress as well or God a granite I pray Lord it's your presence would be with them all the during the next couple of months Lord Jesus we just ask your blessings upon your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you know what the message what a day what a time you and I are leaving an opportunity to just be you know what God says we are in that something to just be what God says we are and let it come forth and manifest in that way in our lives each day walking in

thought about it and camel will probably drink 30 gallons of water and he might have had if he just had 10 you know I mean that's 200 gallon is she drunk how about you sisters would you be willing to run down in a whale and back out or draw or whatever there's different ways over there I've seen it both way I've seen the crank up kind but I've seen where they had to walk around the wall walk around the wall and go down and loop up the water and walk back up not no little bitty thing either I'm talking about her hold as big is almost from here to where Terence is standing they go down and and get that water would you sisters be willing to drop all that water just to let somebody's camels not be thirsty what about a bride bride has come amen amen amen we do this that's the way we say it the word is true and we believe it it's not a not a putting off for it it's it's believing it for right now everything is finished it's settled in God we've had a wonderful time coming down to where we are but now comes up the end of all time the end of all time you know we talked about is it really was saying about Ella either and Rebekah evident but you know it was a long time between dar and the end of the journey where brother read there was a lot of things in there the Isaac and Rebekah could become one the bride of Jesus Christ what a wonderful time tell her brother how much you appreciate they may see something on and just say thank you Lord because we do amen father we thank you for tonight we praise your great name because our brother has reminded us through the reading of the scripture and his comments and things about the bride and who she is and what's taking place in the life stays and she's come forth now Lord we thank you and we praise your great name and we ask
