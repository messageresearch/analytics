we got one down today brother Joe's um uh Jonas had a archery meet yesterday late and he's at brother Robbie ramsing in in making so let's just keep him in prayer also remember I want to thank brother luis's family and brother Lise for for taking brother Eric around and and double preaching um and keeping with him and and uh and taking him places cuz it's hard when you got somebody that number one don't hardly speak your language and number two don't know how to navigate the place it's good to have somebody it's good to have somebody in foreign countries like Michael different ones you get over there what if nobody met you at the airport what you would have known what to do but God send somebody Amen to be there for you everywhere you go amen and we appreciate the Lord for doing that uh let's remember the Bert's family brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday night just keep them in prayer with um the loss of of Steve and uh you know brother Aaron and I were talking and life so fragile Allan Allan sorry Allan life so fragile I I think of of Anna's Steve cuz they kind of look like but uh her uncle but um our brother-in-law so but we need to keep them in prayer but you know he didn't wake up yesterday morning thinking that was his last day you better think about that god holds all in his hands he knows what to do and he does it on time amen so let's just keep them in

salsa and stuff downstairs and we've got U if you want to bring a a soup and a sandwich to to to just fellowship with with the brothers from Ohio they hadn't been down in a while and the dad hadn't been here ever so it's going to be a pleasure uh to have him with us um he about lost it when we up went up there last year and he met brother Dale because he's been listening to the brother Dale since 2015 and he never met him before he saw he saw the message and he saw you know the his brother Bible talking about the teaching through the through through brother dev's Ministry and he just said I'm not going anywhere I'm watching this and and and then he tried to get his kidss which are kind of hard-headed yeah they are amen we all know them now they're pretty hard-headed so it took them a little while to get uh to get started and then and they're actually still on Wednesdays and different times they're actually playing some of Dad's old uh seal tapes and and statue of perfect man and some of mine and his um so they're they're trying to catch up you know what if if if you got a Zeal to catch up God will give you he'll give you a conduit to get it amen he give you a place to he'll give you an internet he'll give you a computer he'll give you a way to get what you need and in this time that's why in this time there's no excuse there's no excuse in this end time you might have an excuse if you lived over in somewhere and well nobody comes over here no you you got you got quotes on your on your watch all right so you can pull up whatever you need but let's just remember that this coming Saturday we'll just have a little Fellowship here about 12:00 and U and enjoy yourself and let's visit with them for a little while then they'll be here Sunday both services and then they'll head back on Monday uh brother Joe is so graciously keeping Richard and Elisha and we're keeping Isaac and Tabitha so just we keep them close but remember February the 17th our Valentine's banquet and remember also you can bring a couple with you and it'll be $30 per couple but they must be married they don't have to be Christian but they got to be married cuz we want to we want to open it up and we want to show love right and that in this that the week of love we want to show Christian love to somebody amen but they they must need to be married all right cuz we still believe in the sanctity of marriage around here all right amen so remember that February the 17th starting at about 4:00 we'll have pictures and then we will eat um we're going to have a little different menu this year so I want you to start thinking Anna uh and I got together and I think we're either going to have like a New York strip baked potato salad or chicken baked potato and salad so it's going to be not be like a buffet style it's going to be more like going to a restaurant and having white napkins and and having a um you know somebody playing no just kidding maybe a mariachi band but it's not going to be no good to have brother Ben Jackson with us I know everybody's wondering who is this guy he comes from Connecticut and don't hold that against him shake his hand say God bless you from the south and I'm sure it's like Five Below 1,000° up there right now and 24 in of snow so we don't have that down here but we have had cold weather though and we appreciate the Lord helping Brother Anderson getting his uh water turned back on but brother Ben goes to brother Craig Bo's Church never met him before heard of him for many years but never met him before maybe I get to meet him and also as somebody said Mester is here so what the heck so um and they go to somebody's Church down in buer South Carolina so they'll be gone after the first service so we don't have to worry about him no more always good to have you with us you know that amen always good to have brother Mike and I tell him I see him all the time cuz I watch brother Jason online cuz brother Jason's a good good Minister and um got some good wisdom and he's always sitting behind him and his dad sitting behind him you know playing instruments so we appreciate that he's still playing those instruments and I hadn't seen Esther sing there yet before but maybe I missed something maybe I missed it okay okay well good to be in the house with Lord just just um tell brother Ben we appreciate you coming bud and and you're not a visitor anymore so you've come with us and and we sure appreciate you and uh and we love you with love of the Lord and tell brother Craig when you get back that we said hello amen he won't know who we are but he has probably heard of brother Dale I'm sure so let's we're going to start a little bit different today we're going to start into the church ages I really enjoyed U uh getting back into church age book this past week and been staying with Dad a little bit and so I just took the church AE book and opened it up and was walking around with him and I just reading it actually I stole his church AE book so uh it had all the cheat sheet in it you know so I was reading his quote what he had written down before there was a concordance I was reading you know and I said okay all right I remember that and I'll go back and check it out but it's been refreshing so what we're going to do today is we're going to talk about that we got to get through the church ages and we got to see who this is because when we went through that statue of perfect man that's him display himself to us and then we display that through us back to him all right well here in the church ages we're going to see that he's in the midst of the church age we're going to see that in just a few minutes but he is now a judge and you got to understand that you say no it's Mercy yes it's Mercy but he's a judge he's already judged those other Church ages amen we'll read that in just a little bit so Lord bless you let's start into the church ages we're not going to get into Ephesus right now but let's stay and let's see who this man is that's controlling everything and look what form he's in now he has decided to become into another form all right he decided in the beginning was the word word was with God and that word was made flesh now he has transferred that into us by inor he has imorph himself in a bride and he absolutely right here tells us he's in Bride form right now all right so let's bow our heads Lord we know we got many sick many ones Lord that that are um not here Lord because of sickness we pray that you'd touch their body Lord be with the ones Lord that are sin sick as as brother Donnie said Lord we think of many ones that should be here Lord of our children and family and different ones Lord I pray that youd touch their heart father it's getting late this Gentile dispensation that we're that we're in now is about to be over in Revelations 4:1 John was caught up through an open door and father I believe that we're now into that place to where we're going to be caught up in a Rapture and whatever happens down here is going to be judgment to the Gentile dispensation father just be with us let us not be scared but let us have some urgency that we study more pray more come to church more do the things of the Lord more this year father than ever before father forgive us of our sins and faults and many mistakes Lord we make ask you to bless the bride around the world Lord be with the ones Lord that in places where there's a lot of bad weather Lord I pray that you'd touch them and be with them Lord give us this day our daily bread we come to hear from you father so I pray in Jesus name that that will happen amen Revelations 1:1 will dis still on the son of man because right at the beginning right here at the front boom when John looks over he saws he saw what one lik to the son of man so we're going to carry that into what we've been speaking for 10 and something services but now we're going to put him in the m M all right everybody with me Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now we're going to maybe break a little bit this down a little bit more later on but look at verse 11 saying I am Alpha and Omega now the alpha bride has already been here that was the Beginning Church ages that was the way God wanted his church to start he said I'm Alpha and Omega now in between he was the Holy Ghost and he had Believers and he had bride but what whatever he had in the first he wants it in the last all right us we're in the Omega part all right thereby with me on that I am Alpha and Omega and we'll see in just maybe later on down the road that even the verbiage that John uses shows you that Ephesus and leosa is the two book ends all right we'll see that maybe later on I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest right in the book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia under Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia and laa and I turned to see the voice now remember John that voice was familiar John had literally heard Jesus for three and a half years speaking all right and John was put on the aisle of pmas to write what he saw all right but he's going to hear something first because Faith cometh by hearing so he had to have faith in what he was hearing so I turned to see the voice that spoke to me and be and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as flames of fire and his feet liking Define brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength there seven identifications of this man that we're talking about and we'll break them down this afternoon all right as the sun shineth in its strength all right you may be seting the Lord that His blessings of the word now that word mixed means among or from among and actually it means also the middle all right can everybody see that okay CU if I if I magnify it maybe a little bit more there'll be some um some uh pictures on here that we can uh that we can see so let's let's get us a little bit more up here all right so he's in the midst of the church he's in the midst of these candlesticks now here is the Candlestick that the manora as they call it now watch cuz I'm going to show you another picture I couldn't find one with Jesus in the middle of it but I did find one but the the lamp stands off a little bit it makes them separate listen it's not separate what happened was in the inner Court not the holy of holies in the inner Court there was an artificial light and it was these candles sticks what happened is is there was a little thing down at the bottom at that ve at the bottom of that let me get up here we maybe you can see it all at the bottom of that there was a little place you could open and you poured oil in all right and then the wick ran down into those into those bars all right everybody seen everybody seen a hurricane lamp well I'm sorry you young kids it's not LED it's actually a burning fire we have a couple that we use and it's full of oil and it's got a wick that you turn up and down to make the flame go up or flame go down so that's kind of what that was at the top of that was fire and as you kept pouring the oil in the priest would come in and light those and he listen he lit one off the other that's important because it's the Holy Ghost in every Church age but it's the fire from one Church age that goes to the second Church age from the second Church age to the Third Church age listen they are separate in in do but they're the same with the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost in every Church age it's just that we'll see here in just a few minutes that that light is being divided into seven different ways all right so there's your lamp stand that's the official one that's one that's in the and if you'll look right down here if you can see it there's one right here in this case um which is the just like that but you pour the oil in which is the type of the Holy Ghost and then that Holy Ghost goes into every lampstand all right everybody with me on that now what John saw was pretty close to this right here I don't know if you can see that well it's not too bad I tried to blow it up but you see that he had what hair like wool sword in his mouth stars in his hand his feet was brass but he was in the midst of the church ages and that's why I said I couldn't find one all those should be connected but that's his that's his personage that's who the that's who the uh the church ages are Laing to the son of man G about the paps which means breast all right so that would be a feminist form of Jesus Christ which is the what the bride me and you all right everybody with me on that now I want to show you something here that I looked up and that may be a little bit blurry but we understand about the rainbow colors the the world uses it for for something filthy but God used it for something that said I'll not destroy the Earth with water anymore it was a sign but now what happens and look it's funny that a prism you can't do it with a circle right it has to be a triangular pyramid looking and you can and then reading it online you can take that and you can cut it like this A Million Ways as long as you got a little bit of that glass it will as they say in a minut a big word called refraction but it's important because what God's doing he's standing here one person in the midst of these Church ages but there's a there's a a voice to this age and a voice to this age and a voice to this age and a voice to this age all the way through seven seven different voices coming emanating from one light now the whole thing of this is is this light that goes into this must be white and then as it goes into this pyramid our prism it changes our disperses in different light forms all right what does the prism do the light as light passes now watch as light passes through the prism it's bent in its own unique way right all right everybody with me Bob's Bob laid a lot on y'all about teaching today so we're going to try to understand this thanks a lot buddy lay the pressure would you as like no it just keeps us it keeps us where we study a lot you know study some more so as light passes through now watch as light passes into that it bends or refracts it slows down eternity white light comes to the church ages it goes into seven different and we'll get in we're not get into the brother George Quinn if you want to know about George Quinn about 10 years ago he came here preached about all those seven seven um U colors in the rainbow I will not get into that but it's been a refracted now what refracted is if you put a straw inside of this water remember if you look at it like this it look like it's broke cuz what happens is when the light goes into something an object it bends it can't go straight through it bends and when it bends it slows down and as it slows down it creates color God had to slow down for us amen he was the white light he was the he was the Eternal one but he decided to go through a prism he decided to go through a church age and the angle of light for each age is different so what does a prism do to light as light passes through a prism it is bent or refracted I tried to look up the word refracted in the computer and the uh internet was down it's back up now but what refracted basically is is like I said before something white the light's going like this but when it hits any object it bends right so it refracts or bends just a little bit and then what look by the Angles and plain look it has to be an angle you can shoot it through a flat piece of of glass and you don't get anything it's got to be a shirt in shape can't be round it can't can't even be square as some of us may be but those young ones will understand I mean old ones will understand young ones will not but you see the you see the end of that what it looks like that's what it is it's a triangular glass prism that white light goes into and then the light slows down and and why seven why not 8 10 9 4 three cuz God's perfect he's complete in seven if that white light is him then all that light right there is him being bent or refracted or revelated to his people down here because that's what we see right all right everybody with me so what it does is by the Angles and plain faces of the prism and each wavelength of light is refracted by a slightly different amount every Church age is different by slightly different amount all right everybody with me on that all right upon Passage through the prism the white light it actually says the white light all right the white light is separated into its component colors so inside of that white light come on somebody inside of that white light is those seven colors you can't see them though until he reveals our bends now listen he don't bend the word but he bends himself enough to where he gets down here with us puts up with some of our junk is somebody here today puts up with some of our stuff and says I love you anyway you were part of me before you were part of me when it was white and now you're part of me now that I've divided you into seven different ways I still love you cuz you were in me before the foundation of the world these colors come on somebody these colors were in him before the foundation of the world they just didn't go oh I think I no he had a seven colored prism he had a seven stars in his hand he he had seven Messengers he had seven messages and thank God we're in the last one cuz I'll read to you in just a little bit what happens now let's look at this real quick I was running through this what brother rman said about the allseeing eye for those of you that don't have a dollar bill can you see that or I need to make it a little bit bigger Anna be honest can you see that let's make it just a little bit bigger if you got a dollar bill look look on the back of it but listen this is what America done now think about this the pyramid never had a cap put on it all the pyramids in Egypt one bill nothing it's flat on top how about with me cuz remember the headstone was eject was rejected or ejected was rejected so there shouldn't be that up there but you got to have your white light you got to have that all SE eye that's looking down through the church ages praise the Lord and he's glowing looking down he's an eye why do you think we need isav in this end time all right why do we need isav H because of that right there because look in this use the I representing the allseeing eye of God serves as a reminder that Humanity's thoughts and deeds are always observed by God now there whoever wrote this didn't continue on as brother brandham did he said so that the world so he's looking at the why would the United States he said that's why she's going to be judged more than any other place they are saying that is the Seal of God they're saying that's the allseeing eye of God watching what they're doing as a nation come on he's going to destroy this place if he sees this nation and what we've come now he's got to destroy it but that allseeing eye that's why they why they put it on the back of a dollar bill why God made them put it on there right right God will make you whether you like it or not he'll make you testify what age you're living in he'll make you testify as where the Bible saying whether you're a Christian or not or whether you got the gift of God or not heal it's got to come out like I said before all last year let it out now it's going to manifest itself all right so it's the Eye of Providence or Divine Providence is all seeing eye brother brand and Daniel 70 weeks so now because they're in shape see where I've got this shaped up here like a pyramid the arising of the Saints makes the March into Glory you understand it now Christ The Headstone the rejected Stone that's what we've been talking about and that's what we're into now we're into the headstone talking about the church but you got to look him in the headstone though he's looking looking down on his church the white light is now looking down and he's divided himself into seven Church ages seven manifestations seven men one to each Church age all right so we're not looking for another messenger it's the holy ghost pulling up through that oil that oil pulling up through our Candlestick Christ The Headstone the rejected Stone the allseeing eye coming exactly like the Bible said and Daniel said he watched this Gentile age this is kind of why I'm bringing it cuz listen the Gentile age started on the day of Pentecost the the alpha bride it's going to end in the Omega bride and it will end the Gentile dispensation will end when that stone came out of the mountain that wasn't cut with hands they had never put a Capstone on that pyramid it wasn't cut by man's hands that's why this is not a man this is not a man's religion this is not a man's message except the man the white light it's the white light man's message all right you see it and what did it do it hit the image right smacking the feet if you want to knock somebody over do what hit them in the feet and broke it to Pieces grounded into powder hallelujah what happened at that time the coming of that stone up went the church into Glory at the Rapture cause it ended the Gentile dispensation why did they put it on the dollar bill because it's ending the Gentile dispensation and we're part of it and our own money declares it our own government I'd like to talk to whoever that was that put that on there course I mean they're passed on now but and ask why why' you put that instead of a you know because they got a eagle in one and they got all these things held up with the different things but they put a pyramid with an allseeing eye up went the church into Glory at the Rapture because it ended the Gentile dispensation God ended it up the coming of that stone and that's what we're in today we're into the coming of The Headstone all right The Headstone back to the church to unite the head and body if you'll look at that picture there's still a gap between the two there's an interval there's an intermission there's something in between that that's got to be filled up that is where your seals are there he is Christ is that stone cuz look the headstones already took a body change the ones underneath have not right right there he is Christ is that stone he wasn't born of a man he was born of God he's coming for a church that's been reborn Again by the spirit of God because the strength of that headstone look the strength of that headstone runs all through the church like a magnet and we saw those white lights refracting down upon us into seven different colors so now the future home brother B talks about this now I don't have my pocketbook with with me but if you'll notice he did not carry pocketbook it used to be called a pocketbook it's a billfold all right so some the young people are going did he PR a pocketbook no your pocketbook with your BFF hoo all right like saying boot or trunk and glove compartment or dashboard brother in Connecticut's going what in the world are they talking about I don't have my billfold with me but if you'll notice in your billfold if you have a dollar bill they have the SE of the United States an eagle on one end holding the spears the coat of arms as it were and the other end has got the pyramid with an allseeing eye on top of it see they don't know what they were doing and on there is wrote in Latin and you'll find out it says this is the Great Seal they didn't know what they were doing neither did Kus know he was prophesying brother Bown illustrates is there's the Great Seal here it is see the city he's talking about the future home home so what's he saying listen the future home is going to be what a pyramid shaped City and then he's going to sit down on top of it and be the light and and who is really the light of the city it's not just coming from one man it's coming from the bride we like the city right we're Lights of the world is that not right but when we get over there it's not going to be any kind of Shadow there's not going to be a Monday it's not just a flat Cube like this see it's got to refract so it's got to have an angle to it got to have an angle to refract his light or to bended enough to have seven different Church ages all right not seven different ideas right no that's happened before there's seven seven different ideas in the in the message much less down Through the Ages but it's not it's what the personage of God being shown into each Church age because remember the picture that was a sharp two-edged sword came where out of his mouth but he was in Bride form right we'll see all this afternoon you'll see all this and you'll think man judgment is over that's why a lot of people thinks judgment is over and and we're in a millennium and all we don't have to do this you don't have to do that listen if you have a doctrine that takes stuff out of the Bible and you can't accept all of it I think Revelations 20 or somewhere in there says your name would be taken out of the book if you took something out of the Bible we're not beyond anything right just put that in there for a minute so it's not something new it's not new doctrine it's just more revelation of the same one aren't we going to get more Revelation even when we get over there we're going to get more revelation of what went on and all the things that happened and we'll understand we'll understand it better by and by but it leans up so that it can be seen now he's talking about the city upon this Holy Mountain of the Lord Lord the Lord shall descend upon top of his Mountain here he is that's the reason the Capstone wasn't put on by Enoch that's the reason the Capstone has to come now and the mountain will be pushed up and it'll be the Mountain of God and who's going to live there just the bride everything else will live outside the city in this great big world but the bride will live inside that City and we will be the light thereof that says the Bible the lamb but who are we by the spirit of God today we're the Lamb of God God that too much no it ain't enough right even Jesus stood one day and said whoever sins you retain they're retain whoever sins you forgive they're forgiven who is he talking about he was talking about Peter talking about the disciples but it was Christ in them because they couldn't do it by theel that's right so Blasphemous names we've been reading this quote where brother around SS the church is a mystical Body of Christ and we we kind of showed where the church and the bride was cuz we know the church in the bride is different the mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God did you get it the Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathed breath into the nostrils spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul did you know the Pentecostals are the true Pentecostal church now he's talking about the alpha church is born by the Breath of God Amen we see licks of fire and different ones but it was God had already breathed on them and God breathed on them and went in them to make them Sons and Daughters of god so let's read this just for a moment and then we'll get into the into the thought but watch what brother B says he talks about look each age has had its message and its messenger cuz I want you to get established there is a message there is a messenger there is a rebuke there's a spiritual war starts we'll read that in just a minute cuz what's combating us now it's the anti Christ but remember in the end time though that battle is going to be so close till it's almost going to deceive the very elect that we were talking about Jesus in Matthew 24:24 that the two Spirits would come so close and brother Ram talks about the two spirits in the framework of the church one's going to make it lukewarm cold and Powerless one's going to make it powerful and nobody's going to stop it it will happen through and in somebody called the bride all right all through the times every age has packed its message with a messenger our refracted the light of God not changed it but ref reflected or refracted what's already the white light showing in every dispensation has sent forth someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that age every time all right let's read this right here God's gifts find his place notice I've said God he divided his word now look he divided his word at the beginning so he doesn't have a problem talking about refraction God divided his word but listen if it's God's word and he divides it it's God's word if we take God's word and divide it it's our plan right or it's anti anything contrary to God is anti all right brother man says I can take Genesis and show you every age in the Bible we might do that cuz I the Lord I believe opened up something years ago about there is seven Church ages in the Old Testament cuz you got your you got your mirror image and we'll talk about maybe a little bit later it doesn't mean anything to us but it just shows the continuity of God he was in the Old Testament now he might not have been in the people but he was right there dividing and keeping the people he always separate when did Israel get in trouble when they started mingling with the Earth with the world they started mingling he said separate divide come up here with Moses I'm going to destroy them people thank God there was a Moses but but Moses could only do it so much cuz when Dayan and cor did that Moses could have said whatever he wanted to those people had rejected the word and they died all right the ground opened up and wow what a what a great God I can take Genesis and show you every age in the Bible down to this age here all the Cults and things we have today I can show you exactly where they was in Genesis now I want you to realize and and understand that brother randam he's he's getting ready to go through the church ages to show each age but now remember when he first got started he didn't know every Church age messenger he's the only one that God delivered that to him because it just says to the angel of the Church of Ephesus Angel of the Church of Smyrna Angel the church thara and even brother brandham was studying we'll get to it in the second second Church age he was leaning toward polycart because polycart was a great man great individual he had done great things but he had one thing against him that the Holy Spirit brought to brother bram's attention brother Bram said he leaned too much to denomination so he chose irenius the Holy Spirit chose irenius and then showed brother Brenham and and showed him that that was the right refraction or the right light now listen polyart wasn't lost right he's a great man he was absolutely they said that when they burned him at the steak that at one moment the fire came away from him then when the fire came in they said it just like an angel just like something lifted up out of the out of the uhu out of the Flames so God takes care of his own God gave his word so much here and so much here so much here for each age and then he sent a prophet down anointed to make that word come to pass and it supports the other one now look it supports the other one that was coming they're not different it supports the other one and see like the Messiah always supported every prophet in his own life his own being the word that was given for that day are the refraction or the bending of the light and foretold what the other one was going to be now see i' never seen that before but you got to have a platform for the next person to stand on that's why we'll talk about later on about the overlap or the or the message between the ages there's an overlap that overlaps the church ages it's not just an Abrupt end that Wesley died and everything died with him no Wesley passed on and the messages keep going then then you got the Pentecostals come in at a lap over and they're bringing it up then you got each one are lapping over God doesn't have a time when he's not in all the ages he's got bride in every Church age but they lap over and as we've many times before and we'll get into it in the L toy in church age I believe that's what brother Bram a lot of people that were he was preaching to were not message Believers oh don't get quiet on me they weren't message Believers there wasn't a message Church started till later on in the late 60s all the other ones went back to their denominations cuz they saw they got they got Blinded by the Light that's right amen they didn't see the refraction for their age they didn't see the color for their age but yet they were part of it okay they don't we're not kicking anybody out God's the only one that does that all right oh by the way thank you Hudson see that thing he's holding up back there that's a a fan I think Sister Charlotte brought a bunch of them up here and and uh I like palm trees palm tree leaves so we'll just just if y'all get sleepy this will really help you cuz you know if you fall asleep you might throw it to your neighbor and hit them in the head or something you know so we'll sharpen the ends of them then we'll pray for the sick get you laugh a little bit cuz you fallone sleep already look and every one of them spoke of that white light so you can't take anything away from the white light which is God all right can't can't can't take it away from anything from the pure word of God cuz he was the fullness he was the head of the prophets in other words the allseeing eye he was the word of God he was the prophets he was the word of God he was the prophets there he is how wonderful what he was each one of those prophets now listen we'll continue on identification of Christ 1964 this is after the after the seals open actually in the church ages now we find out that he in the beginning God look God lotted so much word for each age listen the alpha bride had so much word then what happened in the other ages in between all that man got involved brought their own idea and it weakened the church it didn't destroy the church it weakened her but he still the the light still refracted but God didn't refract his light on a father son Holy Ghost baptism that's right he allowed that to happen because man had just got into such a scruple like brother Brandon on marriage and divorce don't go by leave when you say marriage and divorce people getting real nervous nobody leave but he want had the marriage and divorce he said what's the problem what's the problem with why we're sitting right where we're sitting today he said misinterpreted theology coming from the pull pit saying it's okay to do that come as you are I believe in coming as you are but I don't believe in leaving as you were I don't believe in living like that on down the road come as you are no doubt you got to get into you got to get into water somehow but that water should what clean you praise the Lord don't miss this when it comes time for that word to be revealed talking about each Church age I want to see how listen this thing is separated but it's all together it's all together the body of Christ but it's been separated into this church age here the first church age they were powerful God God Jesus had just left the scene they had Paul Peter and all these great Apostles they had the foundation of the word of God they had these virtues working in their church but what happened was this man got involved at sthus right at the first you know he says oh Jesus was a light substance of God so see that just we'll get to it in a little bit as as brother Bob was alluding to the nician spirit it starts as a what SA well do you think I don't think what do you think God don't care what you think remember I told you you get in real big trouble when you start a word of of a sentence with me saying I thought we're going downhill from then on all right and then as the word becomes time look time for it to be revealed in other words the light's coming in it's already refracted in one age and it's going to be just and listen it says slightly slightly into another church age don't miss this when it comes time for that word to be revealed usually man had it so messed up till he appeared to a prophet and we'll get into that just in a few minutes and see where brother Brown in the first seal clears every bit of this up and shows exactly how God moves in the church ages praise God for the open of the seals I think he says that too search the scriptures see now remember the unchanging God the unchanging white light he cannot change his ways he must every time do it the same unchanging listen he did it the same man's the one that took and refracted it or or bent the word of God to fit what their Doctrine to fit their time why they say you know they say well y'all just y'all just live in the Old Testament or you you you just you know you look like back in under somewhere you know I remember when Grandma used to well what changed what changed I tell somebody in the family the other day we were talking about granny granny Dale she's she died in 19 87 or 88 but I never see her I never saw her wear a pair of pants and she was a Baptist long hair I mean who took that out man took it out living the word of God man took it out and what did God do I'll tell you what he done here in just a few minutes and seven Church agents that set forth in Revelation now look chapter one is showing as brother R calls it his personage it's showing who this guy is but it's also showing where he is he's in those seven Gentile Church ages in a bride bride form all right so in Revelation chap 2 and 3 Tak in the whole span of the fullness of the Gentiles cuzz remember Revelations 41 does what John top of the Bride gets caught up right in a Rapture are the whole time in when which God is dealing with the Gentiles unto salvation in every single age Bar None it says the very same thing in opening and closing the message to each age until the messenger of and he list them these things saith he etc etc he that hath an ear let him singular hear what the spirit sayith to the churches notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age they're the color or the refraction they catch the word of God they catch the Revelation for their hour then they bring their message we'll talk about that in just a second only one messenger for each age now ask you a question brother BR never denied D Moody all he he he list all these great people right Clarence Lin all the he he names them right he said he said Dwight Moody put millions in in the kingdom of God was he a church change messenger no he didn't have the light for his day he had part he come in under the light he actually came in under Wesley's light in the late 18 1900s early 1900s but only one messenger for each age and you talking about Charles Spurgeon and all these different ones Smith Wigglesworth read about that man he wasn't a prophet messenger he didn't have the light for the day but he told a guy that had one leg he one leg sure he didn't have a foot he told him to go buy him a pair of shoes right uh do you hear what I said a pair of shoes and when he got in the shoe store he believed that man so much but when they went to get his shoes when come back there was a foot there now praise God but he wasn't a messenger because he didn't receive the message it was made for one man William brandham one man John Wesley Martin Luther Columba all the way down the line and that one messenger is the messenger to the look to the true church he speaks for god wow by Revelation to the church you know why cuz he catches that white light which is eternal God he catches the thought of God brother R said let's go back into the what back part of the mind of God nobody's ever said that before the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger people want to try to do away with brother brandom well find me a messenger find me somebody I need number seven I need that seven star I need I'm in lay out of SE that's for real I need that messenger if brother R's not yet God got to send it to me but I believe he already did N is a group getting their Collective Revelation watch this but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God now this will explain it all right here in the first seal brother Brown says look says now notice but it's to be revealed when the lamb leaves his intercessory place from the father now that's Revelations 5 now he takes the book of seals the book of seals or a book sealed with seals everybody with me amen the book was was a scroll remember it wasn't the Bible it was a scroll and it had tabs on it it sealed up what was inside each one had seal right breaks them and shows them look at the End of the Age now after the intercessory is over the church age has done finished up he come in the first age the Ephesian age revealed sent a messenger notice what happened as we go along now here is the plan of it now this this is explained the best I've ever heard I hope brother Brown said it here's the plan of it now as we go through the church ages you keep this in your mind the first thing happens there's an announcement in heaven first what happened a seal is open right we'll talk about that in a little while what is that a mystery is unfolded Paul was the mystery of Christ revealed for his age right brother brandham was the mystery of Christ revealed for the age but then there was a there was an announcement in Revelations 10 that in the days of the voice we would catch it all right everybody with me on that we would catch it he didn't take it with him he gave it it went through the Airways it broke the airwaves we break it every Sunday and every Wednesday we break the Airways with the what the voice of God are you listening to it or not so now listen we F to go through the church ages I want to tell you something we talk about church ages you look at yourself now Paul irenius Martin and different ones they were human beings Paul had issues the things I would I would not the things I do I shouldn't do he wasn't sinning like that but he wasn't doing right 100% he'll tell you he didn't look at each one of them each one had a flaw something quirky that you know but you know what that didn't stop God he picked that age that messenger for that age so he picked Paul Paul for that age but now Paul he had to go about preaching irenius was was married the different ones you you know what I'm talking about you and I we're like we hold them up like this and we think man they were all perfect no they were human you just didn't get all their life I promise you if you started tomorrow that's enough to begin with right there you start tomorrow and write down everything you did and record everything you did through the week I said everything let's see what it sounds like on next Sunday so we all got issues brother Brown said he had complexes so when we but what I'm saying is when we look at this we got to see Christ in the messenger preaching the message and then it affecting the the bride affecting her all right and you know it does affect you in your personal life because I hope when I hear all these all these um uh y'all going to do that right start recording yourself tomorrow morning and bring it Sunday we'll go through some of them we'll edit some of it out but I hope somebody didn't go to a bar didn't go to a you understand what I mean so that way it has affected us where we don't do that but we're still humans right and we do human things we make human mistakes but a mystery is unfolded now how's it unfolded it's got to be somebody to speak it and there's got to be somebody to hear it Faith cometh by hearing hear what the spirit says to the church right two one listen twice as much as you talk I'll get there and I hear Giggles Rippling all the way back to the back see I told you I'm I have flaws hello so now look what brother Brian says look when a mystery unfolds now listen what is a mystery it's something previously hid but it's there uh those lights are there in that white light it just takes God to slow down a little bit and and get into a messenger slow down a little bit get into a messenger and then that light bends it doesn't it doesn't break it bends and gives Paul a message to the church but there's somebody there listen we see rainbows we see light if we didn't have any eyes that's why the end of the church agent says isaf use isaf brother R talks about Gree who talks about gree Isa and when a mystery listen a prophet is is the word for his day so he lives to the whole thing now he's got flaws he's got a family he's got all these different things but he is the message so he becomes that part of the word brother Bram was identified with Malachi 4 Revelations 10 Luke 17:30 all those different ones he identified with that and he lived it so now what we got to do is catch that same mystery and live it and when a mystery unfolds look a trumpet sound so to unfold a mystery somebody's got to hear it like I said before they might be those seven um Indigo readed and all those different ones but unless you see it there nothing nothing there so unless somebody sees the light for the day unless somebody sees the light for the day and becomes that light they're Blinded by the Light yeah all right now look when a mystery unfolds God has these great Mysteries he's getting ready to unfold them he's going to unfold them through seven Church AE Messengers all right and then there's going to be seven groups that receive it and when a mystery unfolds a trumpet sounds a message and we hear it now watch what he says it declares a war that's why we're going to see his seven full personage this afternoon if it declares a war there got to be somebody to fight it right and who's the captain to the host he's already identified himself as that and when a mystery unfolds a trumpet sounds it declares a war what did you do when you got born again when you got born again you may have been out in another church not I'm not talking about a m Church you might have been in the Baptist or the Methodist or the Pentecostal but when you heard the voice of this messenger come on somebody you're sitting here today for a purpose you're sitting here today because you heard something different than your neighbor heard you heard something different than your family heard maybe sometime you heard the voice of God for your day and now you're producing whatever light that is and there is something to that because indigo is the beginning and I think red has the weakest signal but we'll talk about that maybe later on because each one of them when the light bends it changes it just a little bit to make the different colors so as it bends it slows down we'll talk about that in a little bit not today we're about done now we get out of here and go eat something get real full for this afternoon and when a mystery unfolds the trumpet sounds it declares war listen you you yeah you come into the message and it was just so perfect I Comm in and everything's fine everybody loves me my family just opens arms they say come on in no they don't it declares a war cuz there's only two people fighting that's the devil and God and when he gets inside of you he's fighting so there's a war declared now when brother Bram came on the scene we saw all the wars he was born during World War I he was here during World War II and right after World War II in 1947 he got his Commission right then you had the Korean War and he was in part of the the the most wars that a prophet had been here he was in them he wasn't in them he was here during that time there was a war declared and fighting began why does a war happen in the natural two opposing forces one has this idea one has this idea everybody with me same thing with you when you get your side or the Lord's Side there's always opposition yeah you'll be hated by your family even Jesus said he said father and mother sister and brother you know they're not going to understand you and they don't why do you'all do that church thing all the time what one guy asked me and cusses and prays at the next meal but why do y'all do that church thing I said well that's what the Bible said to do if you didn't see it in the Bible then you need to open your eyes right amen what you here today for You Had Your Eyes Open you got the eyes have out you read the scripture where it says as the day approaches you need to come to church more problem is is we don't have a revelation that it's getting close to the end or you'd be here more and more look it declares a war though look or a plague Falls right and a church age opened a a light comes forth a a different color light than was before but it supports the light before because it comes from One Source the white light but it come through a prism it come through the headstone that's why the headstone was rejected he became the chief what Chief Cornerstone that Through the Ages that light could shine through that and refract hisself in all these Church ages then what's going to happen though see we get the headstone he's up here pulling us up here there's a push up there there's a pull that's why it's the third pull it's pulling us up into the headstone amen or plague Falls and a church age open see what is the war part the angel of the church now watch catches the mystery of God right not f look not fully yet revealed brother R didn't know what the seals were come on he didn't know every Church a messenger in 1947 but he kept he kept going he kept catching staying in the mind of God staying in the mind of God and then God would say study this or have you ever looked at this take this right here the angel of the church catches the mystery of God what am I saying well you know you just don't have a church anged messenger and all of a sudden he's he's uh you know he's working at wherever and and all of a sudden it just God dumps on him and he runs out and starts preaching no he catches the mystery God starts speaking to him now listen Here's my thought on that like dad's thought is about Abraham why was Abraham called God's not respector persons Abraham's the only one that responded to the call many men from here backwards is going to say you never spoke to me and and God's going to say at judgment he's going to say yep right there I said that person oh that was you yeah that was me oh St Martin remember St Martin in the dream or not the dream but the day before he gives his coat to the beggar has a dream that night and it's the Lord Jesus standing in the same same coat it's me we've been putting this age am to be God to the people God sees it that way what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of God so in other words one man catches it so all of a sudden he's separated right all of a sudden he has this new light that's never been shown before the blue the Indigo the yellow whatever it is he they have that light but now to have that light somebody's got to see it brother Rand would have been not a prophet of the end time if he had have preached and died in 1965 and that was it right no somebody thank God caught the voice of God and said that man's a prophet we need to listen to what he's saying that's the voice of God for the age that was God speaking to a group of people but look not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God then he goes forth to the what to to the people after the mystery has been given to him it's why I believe that whatever that was 1947 when the angel come and met brother brandom he said I've been sent from the presence of God and you got these things you got to do amen and then God kept telling him don't smoke Don't drink don't defile your body because of a work for you I wish You' have spoke to me like that but see we're not light reflectors number one like that he brother Bron was the light reflector reflector for this age we got to get caught up in that light but he came to him first he said hey I got a work for you to do keep yourself but when he does he catches this mystery and then goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him Goes Forth to the people what does he do he begins to Proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war today you're having a spiritual war if you don't understand what I'm saying or what God's speaking to you there's a war going on but it's a spiritual war look and then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon the ones that rejected it that's why this United States America is going to be destroyed they got a messenger that spoke their language lived in their towns went through their pull pets and they turned him down America's going to get it first sorry with the greatest nation and I love where I'm living wouldn't live nowhere else but she can she's going to get it she's going to get it they ain't nothing they ain't no Buy Reading other day where now they taking them silos that they had the nuclear bombs in and these rich folks are building their their house down in them where nobody blow them up guess what read the word of God that's a little bit futile it don't matter if you make it through a nuclear bomb explosion soon as you walk out you going to get burned to Pieces by the radiation so hey get into god let's be the light if we be the light then not going to worry about the rest of it but he lays them asleep then he drops a plague upon the one that rejects it a temporary this where I want to get to a temporary judgment cuz this afternoon you're going to see all these Flames Flames coming out of his eyes feet like brass sword coming out of that's all judgment but where is he going to judge the world from his bride he drops a plague on them who rejects it a temporary judgment and then after that is over now look then he goes on they denominate bring in denominations and start off with that man's work like of Wesley and all the rest of them then it gets all in the scrapple again then another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on Earth another refraction of the light arrives on Earth for a church age now listen we don't get any more of this there's not another messenger there's not another age this is it right no more we can't say well we'll just wait till the next guy comes there is no there's only one next guy to come then when he arrives the trumpet sounds he declares war see then what happens finally then he's caught away and then when he's laid away then plague Falls destroys them that's why I said brother stood one day and he said these denominational churches are no more than lodges go to one don't lay out a church but we may not have church one Sunday do like I did I went back to the church of my Nativity where I was raised and me and June got married and dead as the hammer I'm sorry it was so formal I asked a girl s beside me I said can I say amen and I get thrown out she said yeah but nobody else did so I didn't but that's the way it is everywhere right even jun's dad realized going to Presbyterian Church is nothing but a ritual just a ritual you say these things you sing two songs you you do a doxology and even in the Baptist Church they they used to not do that but they have a thing they read like Apostles Creed almost but it's not the Apostles Creed that's kind of funny because they hate the Apostles Creed and that's their mama but listen brother Brandon that was where a war started he come on Earth listen God was okay with the denomination listen to me until brother rown came on the scene think about it but Jesus walked into the temple he said if I had not have come here you had a cloak you had Ten Commandments that says as long as you don't touch that woman you're good he said but I say unto you boy talking about a war I say unto you you just look on a woman to lust after and you've committed adultery already they hated him for that the religious people killed him not the people the Beggs on the street the religious people killed him CU why there was a spiritual death declared he said you're dead twice plugged up plucked up dry Man's Bones praise God we were dry Man's Bones but according to the word of God we got a quickening them dry bones have come to life and a bride in the end time and then when he's laid away then plague Falls in other words like I said before brother B tells me many many times he said there will not this will not denominate and there'll not be another denomination now we understand that may they may have been more cuz there was 900 and something if you look them up on the Internet there's like 13,000 different denominations now boy God so really confused think about that white light and it opened up into 13,000 in different views no God's Sovereign God said you going to hear this prophet he preached around the world seven times I made sure that we kept him on tape I made sure brother R stood there in 1947 preached his first sermon he said they got these new gadgets and it was a wire that they' got from the war that they developed into something that you could record voices with well well hello now War might have started but the real war started when they put that on tape amen and then when he's laid away then the plague Falls destroys him spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group then he goes on to another listen we don't have one to throw it back to musicians come on we don't have want to throw it back to we're at this is all you either catch this light this refraction or you don't get it that's right he sent us the spirit of Truth as brother B was talk about this morning what did he send us he sent us what at that day you shall know you'll know your Messer for your age it's all right I've read about Luther and Wesley I'm reading some of their books now not that they wrote but about their life and it's wonderful but you can see listen Martin Luther was a Catholic hello he still wanted to pull the Catholic church out with him cuz he liked some of the things that was going on but God said no separate yourself I got 95 things you need to write down right and when he posted them things on that door that excommunicated him from the Catholic Church why he caught the light of god let's stand to our feet at that day you'll know I ask you today do you know your messenger and your age that you're living in is this the message of the hour or is this just other something that we're going to go and and then we're going to all die and and somebody else is going to come back up and brother Mike is going to start preaching and and said Mike I said mik oh Michael and Micah okay but this is how we're going to know the difference the comforter which is the Holy Ghost that's why brother BR said that was the most important thing in your life Esther it's okay I breathe but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things listen he'll tell you what light you're living in he'll reveal to you what you need for your time and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world gives give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither be afraid cuz there's two Spirits coming Matthew 24:24 is going to be two spirits in the framework of the church false Christ not false not false demons false Christ which are demons are we singing songs now you hear that you don't to hear that I guess I need to I hear something playing in the background here look the church Spirit of the church people and the bride Spirit of the Bride people would be so close together till it would deceive the very elect if it was possible that's how close right that's how close that's why brother random came to tell us the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless and absolutely Satan has done his job that's right but it exposes Satan now Reveals His work he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church in other words your light for your day cuz listen we can't live in Luther's light Luther's light will not even get you in the body of Christ amen it's a different light for a different age but we we collect off of that same same comes from the same Source we believe in Luther's justification amen you got to be justified by faith Faith it's not by works but if you get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit deser and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ with stood his every effort to gain power in the desert Satan hates Revelation but we love it amen with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail not saying it won't come it's going to come but the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against us
