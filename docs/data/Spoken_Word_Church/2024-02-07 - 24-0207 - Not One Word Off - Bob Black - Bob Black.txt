and good to be back with you all we uh we've been on the road a lot lately and uh I sure appreciate my wife and she she don't like me doing stuff like this but I appreciate my wife and my kids my daughter's hanging out with me on the road up and back that was that was a rough weekend she's going to get me later oh no well we we anyway we'll leave that for later but uh it it was a good weekend good good time with the Believers up there and just a precious group up there in in Indiana and so tonight we're going to take a little scripture from Hebrews chapter 1 and Genesis 1 and just take a little topic um not one word off cuz that's what we God wants us to be let's bow our heads Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word tonight Lord Jesus and we just Lord want to invite you in Lord God to take these words off the page and Quicken them to us Lord God and give us exactly what we have need of and Lord looking around the room Lord you know every need Lord Jesus Lord I don't I don't know what's buried down in the heart of the different s men and women that are gathered here get today Lord but you know Lord and you know exactly what they have need of and we've got a promise laying in your word that the word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the Heart Lord Jesus you can let it go out and just lay right in the good ground and and begin to draw and and and and minister to exactly what the needs are Lord and we just ask that tonight Lord Jesus that you'll just be with us and feel at Liberty to to be with us and come and stir up our hearts tonight we pray in your name amen now Hebrews chapter 1 verse one if we'll start with that and it says and then we'll go to Genesis 1 it's Hebrews 1 says God who at Sury times and in diverse manners spake in time passed unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person now there's there's the part to kind of hang on to the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins said sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high and so that's speaking of Christ and then we'll go over to Genesis 1:26 that says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth now you think about what a promise that is to have dominion over every everything that's what the Bible says so God created man in his own image in the image now see how that ties together with Hebrews 1 Christ is the express image of his person now so God created man in his own image Amen in the image of God created he him male and female created he them you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we'll just kind of tonight uh I just want to kind of just maybe talk and of course some I know how sometimes I'll say that I'll talk I just want to talk and then here we go but I just want to talk about some things and uh that are laying here in the scripture and you you think about what it's saying there that Christ is the express image when he was walking on the shore of Galilee if you want to know if you want to talk to God you can walk up to him and talk to him but then then then uh and of course they didn't recognize him they said if show us the father and it sufficeth and all those things and he's like I've been have you been with you all this time and you didn't recognize it in other words he was he was God on display where they could imagine that to be able to walk up to God and give him a hug talk to him and listen to him but now on the day of Pentecost he took that same Essence the same life and put it inside Believers to fulfill what's written in here in Genesis 26 27 that that you and I would also be the express image of God that God could take his own life and put it inside of a Believer and they would be the expression of Christ on display amen now you you think about how how maybe strange that is that because there's a lot of fake out there there's a lot of nonsense out there there's a lot of things like that that get people off the track and you look at you people people get you know confused about things how things work but there's the promise L here that you and I can be the express image the express image of God God on display where you can what does that mean that you can be just as kind as Christ just as patient as Christ that's what these attributes that we got on the board behind us just as virtuous as Christ that you can think like Christ that you can be one with Christ God wants us to be completely United with him amen now you think now just kind of laying out the pattern down through down through the last 2,000 years it's like the word has been just growing and growing and growing where you know down in the Dark Ages they they were just putting everything on the Catholic system and the way that things were that that you had to come to a priest and confess things and whatnot and then Martin Luther came with it uh that you know he began to preach that we're just we're justified by faith not not because we confess to a man or anything like that but because because we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and the word kept growing and growing and then John Wesley John Wesley began to preach that we we ain't going to live like the devil if we're we're Christians we're going to we're going to be Sanctified and we're going to be set apart we're actually going to fulfill the things like like in Ezekiel 44 that says that we're supposed to be not God's going to separate the the profane from the holy the profane and the holy got to be separated and that's what John Wesley was preaching that we're going to be we're going to be clean even to the point where John Wesley wouldn't drink uh coffee or tea because he was like if it doesn't have any profit to me we're we're we're not going to do anything with it because he was I want to be separated he wanted to be separated and and the word just kept growing and growing of the day uh on isusa Street the Holy Ghost fell on the on Aza Street back in 1906 to to show that God was he's growing it's it's it's like the word is growing that um more word is being given to actually restore the signs and wonders and the gifts and things in the church and it just keeps growing and growing and unfolding why because God wants to God wants us to bring us to a place where there's no there's no hindrance to the spirit moving there's no hindrance to the way that you think about the word that you can actually believe for all that all things are possible why why are these why is it so because there in Genesis 12627 God created us to have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth now isn't that why even in your own natural self you you like my wife loves the little chickens she loves the rabbits there's just something in you you want to you want to take care of the little dog you want to take care of it you want to take you want to you want to help the cattle in the middle of the night when they're delivering the little calf you want to go out there cuz there's something within you you want to help thing now of course man in this Fallen condition they just pollute the thing they let all their they they pollute the water and pollute the ocean and and and and just fish everything out until there's um having to worry about uh you know no more no more salmon and no more all this in the ocean and and everything just goes Haywire because what that because sin entered the picture but the way that the picture that God had for us from the very beginning was for there to be peace and Harmony Harmony in your mind happiness and joy and and just Union with God that's the the picture that God wants us to be God don't want you to be all depressed and he don't want you to be in a situation where you just you you have no purpose in your life oh that's what this gospel is for to take you from a place where there's just confusion and Chaos in your life and all you're doing is just coming home at night and sitting there on the couch with a beer or whatever and and take you from that place where you have no purpose and bring you to a place where God has makes you holy where you can be a witness to somebody else uh that's going through some rough times and be speak a word of encouragement to them oh I I thank God that that's what the gospel is that you can you can be Christ on display and not just by some intellectual thing where I got to be Christ on this play but actually Christ Living in you his life the very essence of his being the same the same life in you that was in Christ that's what the Holy Ghost is that's what your purpose is in Ephesians 2: 13 and 14 says but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ now that's what the blood of Christ does to take you that were far off and bring you into Union with God for he is our peace who hath made both one and ha broken down the middle wall of partition between us now to think to think tonight that down in sin and and and the the situation that that the fall put you in that that was a wall between you and God and God come and died on the cross to tear that wall down to tear that wall down and begin to bring you together so so that it's it's it's really difficult to tell where the line is if you think like God and and you believe all things are possible and you're living like God and you're walking like God and you can speak a word of encouragement to some somebody else even when when somebody's going through a bad time and you can you can speak a word that will make them want the gospel and you can tell them something that will make them something begin to pulsate in their heart see that's God on display and you can speak something that will that will make them realize that God does care about me and that's what I want to speak to you tonight to remind you that God does care about you no matter what situation you're in maybe the the wall is still up where where you think that you think there's a gap between you and God I I I I want to preach a word tonight that to make you realize that God cared enough for you to come down and die for you to tear down that middle wall of partition to bring you into fellowship with Christ to bring you back into Oneness with him so that you can have real communion with God now now that is what is what is Oneness what is Oneness is Unity Unity where there's no there's no line of division there's no Gap there's it's it's Unity Oneness is a it's like a profound Spiritual Awakening it's it's where you begin to you begin to wonder where is the light where is that middle wall of petition where is the line drawn and and so you you think about the Oneness of God Oneness the Oneness of God the Oneness in God means that that there is one God Oneness in Christ Christ the unity of the Bride the mystical Union of the Bride In Christ all those it's all coming together in one now of course now the devil's got his idea of un unity in Genesis 11:6 it says and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they imagined to do they they got all together and they started building this Tower of Babel which is like uh that's where Babylon began from and bab Babylon all that is a is a symbol of Satan's confusion that he brings and there at that Tower of Babel they just got they were United but there they got confused and they began to God confused their allow them to start speaking different different languages now see the devil's got a plan to bring Oneness that that I don't want and that's to unite us together outside of the the word you see that word is everything to us God wants us to not be one word off now you think you think about that tonight how can you how can you walk together if you don't agree how can you walk with God if you don't agree on things how can you walk with your spouse if you don't agree I I was actually reading this morning I just saw it pop up on my news little thing on my on my phone that that uh spouses that come together if they don't agree on how to raise their children if they don't agree on finances if they don't agree on anything just in the natural it's not going to be long before they're going to separate because they just can't they just can't live together you you're going to before long it's going to Stew up into a great big argument and you won't be able to you won't be able to keep see a even a good marriage just in the natural is going to be started on agreeing on things agreeing on what your faith is agreeing on how to uh do your bank account agreeing on on different things because the Bible says how can you walk together if you don't agreem amen and God is a plan and the devil has a plan and and then the devil is trying to get all people under his plan while God's trying to get people to be one under his plan now what's the devil's plan the devil's plan is just it it doesn't matter we just all come together we'll just all come together and unite and try to just cram everything together and just say it you know just ignore ignore the truth but God's plan is to is to is to unite based upon his word amen and now if you Unite with God you got to separate from the world Amen I this is this is something that maybe you know causes so much confusion to think that when you begin to unite with God it's going to it's going to cause conflict in Matthew 10: 34-36 it says do not think that I have come to bring peace to to the earth I have not come to bring peace but a sword amen right for I have come to set a man against his father now you think maybe in your own life think about the impact that this had when you became a Christian when you begin to find the truth for I have come to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a person's enemies will be those of his own household what a strange thing you think when you become a Christian everything is we're going to be unite and everything's just going to be hunky dory but but then you find out that it actually makes you an enemy of people a person's enemy will be those of his own household and make you enemy of the people that are your family why cuz what a strange thing that Unity with God will always bring conflict yeah right why because there's somebody that's trying to adhere to God's word trying to stay in lock step with the word and others around you may might not see things exactly the same way in Luke 12: 51- 53 it says do you think I came to bring peace on Earth this is Jesus talking do you think I came to bring peace on Earth no I tell you but division y right from now on there will be five in one family divided against each other three against two and two against three they will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law I was actually talking to a brother recently that his his father left the faith and and he's wondering you know they when something like that happens you're always hunting for like that say a Magic Bullet tell me tell me the thing that I can say but but there's the promise here every look every everybody is an individual and that's that's just the way it is everybody's got their own walk everybody's everybody's going to surrender or not surrender and sometimes it's just hard to admit that there's going to be a division as people go their own ways and accept or reject the truth there's going to be this conflict because Unity with God as we're trying to trying to uh trying to walk according to the word it's there's you can't but there to be for there to be conflict and that message marriage and divorce I'm just going to read one marriage and divorce quote brother Ram said we are not lutherans we're not Wesley neither are we Pentecostals we've got to be children of this age through the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth a child of this age the seed child he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating him saying by himself his children begin to kind of look more like him because it's fully maturing or they become children of the word not children of the church Children of the word and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word amen unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made Theory she'll be purely unadulterated Bride of the word oh you think that now that God is going to have a bride a bride that that uh that is not touched by any any of man's ideas is any man's thoughts about how things should be she's going to be a a bride that is not one word off now you think about one not one word off is the word is maturing and maturing until it comes finally comes to a grain and you're like okay we got the word but brother Ram said it's got there's on that on that stock of wheat it's got to mature and what's happening as it's maturing it's actually coming out to be expressed in your life oh think about what's happening is it is it you you come you struggle and you struggle and you're striving and to to study these things out and come to a place of maturity and then you you you it it matures and matures until it's on that wheat stock right there the the corn but now brother brandom laid it out like this it's got to mature and mature and mature until it's like bread on the Lord's table bread on the Lord's table oh now that's mature where it's actually living so all those thoughts and all those ideas and things that we've learned about become more than just an idea but they come an expression oh that's why I preach so much that it's got to be lived it's not just something that we intellectualize or we just learn about but it's got to be liveed the same kindness oh brother Bob we don't need kindness yes we do because Christ was kind we don't need patience oh yeah we do we need to be patient with one another and patient with God we need to be temperent temperent to be in control of our spirit to not fly off the handle when somebody says something wrong we need to have all these things these attributes in us that were not just things that Jesus knew about but things that he expressed in his life it's got to be expressed it's got to be expressed until it's like bread on the Lord's table sitting there a loaf of bread and that is perfect Oneness Oneness Unity with God where there's no difference no no no no difference between what Christ lived and What Christ manifested and what you and I are living and to get to that to get to that place it's going to take a perfect surrender now that's that's what uh you know many times you know we'll we'll think about Oneness as learning but I want to maybe shift your thought this tonight to surrender because it's surrender we can learn and learn and learn and And just pack in all that knowledge and you never surrender and you never come to Oneness because you ain't surrendered you know a lot but you don't surrender now you you say well brother Bob I've surrendered when I got born again well listen now in the in the in the in the type that of of the life that Jesus lived there he was in The Garden of Gethsemane and he had to surrender all of his will not my will not my will but thine be done now see it's surrender surrender to come to a place where everything that God wants to be manifest in your life is lived out and manifested every drop of goodness and Holiness can be squeezed out like it was there in that Garden of the Gethsemane oh God wants to say sometimes he'll bring us through the wine press and bring us through events of life and bring us through situations where you don't know exactly what's going on what's he trying to do he's trying to test you out and bring you to a place where you of total surrender total surrender to God oh you see when you get totally surrendered to God it's like you're in a stream it's like you're in a river and and God's just bringing you you're God is bringing you where he wants to bring you and then you can look back in your life and you can remember where God brought you from this church to this church to this church to the what your final destination he brought he's leading you he's leading you all through your life and as you surrender to him then you give him the ability to do something to do with your life what he wants you to do now there's perfect Oneness Perfect Harmony Harmony where there's you know you ever hear go listen to a choir where you got maybe somebody singing Out Of Tune and and and if you if you're not toned if it'll make you go but but a good choir a good a good little group of singers or whatever Everybody's In Harmony it just sounds wonderful because they're listening to One Another they're singing the the right tune they're obeying the the leader they're in the right beat every they're in the rhythm of the composer everything's just as it should be and that's Harmony that's that's the way that God wants us to walk in this word to be in the rhythm of the composer the rhythm of the spirit of the author that wrote this word and and to and to be to to be right in beat with what he wrote down on the pages of this gospel and brother Brandon would say now the first man and the first woman in the garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve now that see they wasen on Facebook and they wern't on watching Netflix and they wern't on their Tik Tok and they wern't they weren't spending all that time on the in politics worrying about whether Trump or Biden or this or that was going to they were they were in harmony with God's word they were in the Rhythm I I I I think so many times we get called up on what governor abid's doing in Texas or whether the buses are going and we get so caught up in all those kind of things or whether Co is real or not or all those kind of things and we get we get you get sidetracked away from the the real thing which is the word of God now brother Ram said now that is perfect Oneness God and His creation God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God God God and his family was one so what's Oneness now Oneness is communication and understanding and a common heart what what what what situation did they find themselves in they were ready to hear anytime God wanted right anytime now you'll find you'll find really that the more time that you spend with God the more time that he'll spend with you the more time you spend alone Al in prayer the more time you meditate on the word the more the more it's like the Gap begins to close that's how Adam and Eve were they were ready any time for fellowship and communion with god well God come down in the cool of the evening they didn't have to say hold on I got to go pray up a little bit let me go put this magazine that I'm looking at under the bed let me go let me go put this blanket over the TV let me go let me go let me go hide all the that I'm not supposed to be doing let me go get everything right no they were ready anytime oh now that's that's the kind of relationship God wants us to have with him anytime God wants to talk and now come on now it might sound crazy to say that God speaks to us but I believe that when you read this Bible that God will speak to you and he will reveal himself to you not some kind of through some kind of fanciful thing like the world is make it h I heard from God and he told me to go I'm going to aliens spacecraft is going to come pick me up or a light beam is going to pick no now we're not talking fanciful tonight we're talking real that this word of God is actually actually the the something Supernatural happens when you read it and you begin to find out that God cares for you and so on and so forth they were ready for Fellowship they believed what he said and brother BR said any man in his family a correct good Noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere they should all be one father with Mother Mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture now you think about that tonight that your family is supposed to be peaceful you you maybe you get together at night play a little a little board game with your children or something get together and talk to them about their problems and things but your children are supposed to see your life and your wife or your husband supposed to see your life back and forth It's supposed to be a communion and communion comes from communication and understanding I I think so many of the problems today one of the biggest problems with communion in a family is they just don't communicate communicate you either communicate too much or you communicate too little the silent treatment is terrible and overcommunication is terrible if you just vomit out everything that pops into your head it'll be Terri what you thought that about me but if you don't communicate at all that's just as terrible if you can find a balance in things where just I've been meditating one of these days I'm going to preach a sermon on balance because there's every everything's got a balance Trinity and Oneness there's balance uh everything but so you're you're you're children see your life your friends see your life and your friends what are they looking at they're looking at your Unity with God your oness with God or your Oneness with the world your Oneness with the things of the world where where you where your heart is that's where you're that's where you're going to be attracted to but listen God wants you to have a peaceful home am that's God's perfect that's that's what God's purpose and brother Brown would say what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and Mo and God with them made them one they wanted to hear what he said they believed what he said they desired what he desired that's what one to see us they wanted what he wanted they believed what he believed believed they wanted to hear what he said what he said they wanted that the same nature the same mind the same thoughts that's what the word is bringing us back to amen and I'm not when I say that's what the word is bringing us back to I'm not talking about just some ideas and things I'm talking about the the the furthering revelation of what's laying here in the Bible amen like in John chapter 17 because that's exactly what Jesus was praying for in John chapter 17 that we wouldn't be different we wouldn't be separated but we would be one now I know a lot of times you've heard us preach here in this church that Jesus was praying for you when he prayed that prayer in John chapter 17 so maybe when you go home tonight you want to read a good good chapter out of the Bible go read John chapter 17 and be reminded tonight that God that Jesus was was praying for you when he prayed his prayer in that chapter Jesus prayed in John chap 17th chapter in the 11th verse that the church and he would be one like he and the father were one that the church we as members of the body of Christ would be one together just like he and the father are one now isn't that what we just read there in Hebrews 11 that Christ is the express image of God but he wants you to be you and him to be one just like he and God and the father are one what a union a Oneness that would be to see God and his church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and God and now that's why in John chapter 14 it says at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you right amen now there's Oneness what what kind of Oneness Unity where the division is being torn down and what's tearing down the division word upon word precept upon precept is bringing you into Oneness with Christ where over time maybe over years like brother bisell set up there at the men's meeting he said it could take a lifetime over years precept upon precept you're bringing you're being brought into Oneness with God that starts from the new birth and ends like now we this might seem a little bit strange but we hear we believe that one day we are going in a Rapture amen that our bodies are going to be changed because that's what the Bible speaks of and and and that Paul told us in the 1 and 2 Thessalonians and and other places that's the church that Jesus is coming for is a church that's one with him that's when his prayer will be answered that we will be one Oneness is with God is now you ever you ever talk to an aged Saint and you just get in their presence and it's like man I feel like I'm in the presence of a somebody holy I I feel like you know you just get it they give you a hug and you just feel the presence of the Lord all around now that's where that's getting to a place what kind of one is where where the line gets a gets a little bit fuzzy am I talking to just sister so and so or is this really an emissary of God is this like a little Messiah it that God's same life is in her or him and when I'm sitting on the on the front porch you know sipping some lemonade and and and talking about the things of God I'm not just talking to just some somebody but this is somebody that God came down and was pleased to dwell in them that was that God come down and was pleased to dwell in them his own life is on display now this is a quote qu that's kind of shocking to some people but somebody you know because in brother bram's life if you don't know his life so many miraculous things happened the pillar of fire was visible on displ and this and his and several photographs and many many many miracles were done in his life to the point where some people got it in their head that he was God and brother randam in one place he said I'm not even going to preach anymore if y'all don't stop believing that but but the line got a little bit fuzzy to people now listen I'm I'm trying to make a point here brother Bram said he said people are saying brother brandom is more than a man he can create and Jesus can look just like brother brandom he said now let me the person said this whoever it might be I don't know but I'm your brother I'm your brother I'm just your brother see Jesus is your savior I cannot be your savior for he has already saved you now you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth the person that told this person this now listen of the way he explains this because you think he's talking about himself but he's talking about you amen he's talking about you he said one sense of the word that's exactly the truth another sense of the word is an antichrist there's another example where we need balance because the truth is always between two extremes one another sense of the word is an antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an anti Christ right for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high and will come again in great power and Glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him it's exactly the truth and you become Christ not Jesus Christ but it's the same life in you it's the same life in you that his life is in you the Oneness of himself and the people and and when I say not Jesus Christ not the person the fullness of the person sitting there in the Pew that's not the point that the same life on display that you can be a witness to the world he said that's why he said don't put your light under a bushel don't cover it up cuz you are lights you are the same light just as Jesus was the big light you are little lights to go to your job to go in your family to raise your children to encourage others to be alike to the people at church you are a light because God's light that same light is expressed in you the Oneness of himself in the people is the only grounds of Fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself and his church that's the only grounds of Fellowship now that means the only way that you can ever fellowship with God is to be one with him I'm talking about through a new birth experience where you heard the word and you believed it and you surrendered yourself to it and his spirit quickened that word in your heart and it became a living it became a birth to you the word is birthed in you so we're talking about eternal life to be United with Christ to have the life of almighty God to be United with him in the spirit of his power is eternal life you're eternally United with God now that means if you're separated from God tonight that God doesn't want you to stay in that condition God made a way for you to be United with him to come in Union with him in Ephesians chap 2:3 it says but now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ in Psalms 1331 it says behold how good and pleasant it is when Brothers dwell in unity not to argue and fuss and have a big wall between them in John 17: 211 that they may all be one just as you father are are in me and I in you that they also may be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me now you think about what he's praying there that so that the world may believe that you have sent me that you are actually the witness that God sent that that Jesus was sent into the world that you are the witness because you're a light because you're Union with God I'm going to kind of skip through some of my notes here so y'all hang on I can't I can't do like Andrew lover and just kind of skip through you see what what God is doing is he's dealing with us each as individuals to restore us back into Unity with him to to bring us back into unity all together now brother R said today if we don't live the Christian Life well then would people people can say we're not Christians but if Christ is in you he lives his life in you oh that's why I kind of belabor the point if you believe it's going to be manifested his life is in you in another place he said Jesus said if I do not the works of my father then believe me not but if I do the works of my father believe the works there you are we ought to be reflecting the life of God in our life what is it it's the Holy Spirit his life in you working his own life through you his own life living in you remember it's still him it's his life in you it's his own Life Tabernacle L himself in you in Romans 8:1 it says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now there's the thing that the new birth makes us walk not after that carnal mind not after our carnal thinking but because we're uniting with God it's changing the way that we think and the way that we look at things why because we're surrendered to the word surrendering to the word makes you deny your own will your own thoughts now see there's so many times we'll think well I I wish that things would go this certain way or I wish it could be done this certain way but when you surrender to the word and let God have his way God can have his way with your life and make things go the way that he wants them to go in Romans 8:5 it says for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh the carnal nature and the carnal thinking and everything that's contrary to the word of God but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit that's why Paul said in Galatians 3:1 16 this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh walk walk in the spirit be surrendered to the spirit be surrendered to God surrendered to his word so that he can change us and fulfill his will in us now Jesus laid out that formula to eternal life to Martha there in John chapter 11: 25 and 26 Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever believe liveth and believeth in me shall shall never die you're believing on him until you receive eternal life then eternal life is God's life in you then you're believing in him now that's the difference when you're believing in him cuz it's his life in you that is giv you power to believe oh there's the real a real evidence of a Believer you believe a Believer is going to believe in the good times and bad times and what are you believing in you're believing in a supernatural God that can do things more greater than than anything that you can do with your own abilities anything you can do with your own self It Go Rises you above all of your legalism and all of your works it's not you doing it it's Christ that's doing it oh if we could just have confidence like that when it looks like we've got a big mountain of circumstance in front of us to know that God will bring us through it that God will bring us right through that mountain or over it or around it or he'll remove the mountain one way or another the Mountain's going to move why cuz there's a God on the scene God is on the scene and you're you're not believing on him you're believing in him because there's communion there's no middle wall of partition between him and you he's in there with you he's been vulcanized to your soul he's part of you his life is in there and it's him believing and living and walking and manifesting himself in you now these things are true it looks like so many times you you look at the way the world is and way a lot of people even in the message live and it looks like there's a lot of fake a lot of fake Christianity and whatnot but yet it's true it's true that God is going to have a bride that's in Union with him that God is going to have a group of people that will believe him so much so yielded to him until God can have the preeminence in their life from top to bottom from their feet to their head from the foundation of their experience all the way to the caps Stone God is going to have somebody that will believe him regardless of what all the carnality and all the circumstances and all the mountains in front of their life are they are going to stay right with the word because we can't be one word off not one word off you're one word off you lose your confidence one word off your the word is what gives us confidence in what we believe it gives us confidence that we're really born again you look back in the word and you can identify your life with what the scripture says that your your Born Again experience should be you look back in the word and it identifies who you are and where you come from and it identifies everything it identifies that you can have a hope in Christ that you can have confidence in him it identify it gives you everything that your experience is based on so if you get one word off one word off it just it it it Mars the whole picture oh you see how even in your experience the devil is looking for that one little in your armor the one little Gap in your understanding to get in and that's where he's going to attack you you got to close up every Gap every in the armor every little place so that there's no way for the devil to come and say aha what about this every Gap every every little place has got to be closed up that's where your confidence is that's how you defeat the Devil that's how Jesus defeated the devil when when he came to him after he was after he was baptized there on the Jordan River and began to tempt him with three different times and Jesus everything that everything thing that Jesus said back to him was right out of the scripture doesn't the scripture say and he and he just quoted the word to him and that's how he defeated the devil and that's how you'll defeat the Devil every time you'll not defeat the Devil by some some carnal understanding or some man-made ideas or anything but when you can quote the word back to the devil it'll make the Run make make him run and John chapter 4: 24 it says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and and in truth they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the truth that's on the page but the spirit to give the meaning and the essence to it so you really know what the words are saying oh that's what the Holy Ghost does it gives the real Essence and the real meaning of the things that are laying there on the page and oh what you believe you worship God in spirit and Truth and it'll be the same truth the same truth that Jesus stood for when he was on Earth the same life the same Revelation the same character the same character the same character brother Bob the same kindness yes the same truth yes the same love the same compassion the same everything so we can be in God United brother Brandon was sa because Adam and Eve before the fall before the disbelieving of the word was an example of what we could be in him before the fall they were an example of what you and I could be before the fall and complete harmony with God complete Union with God complete Union with God y'all don't make me struggle tonight y'all looking at the floor and the wall and the ceilings and everything come on now at least pull with your eyes come on now we know we make mistakes brother am said but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them but you see it's following his rules following what he said do stumbl and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he'll stumble he'll get up again so when you fall get back up what what a blessing to recognize our mistakes when we look into the word and find that we're not measuring up we're not matching up something's wrong to recognize that's what I'm talking about tonight surrender surrender to the word and say if I'm wrong I want to get straightened up I want I want everything to be right if if there's something wrong with my life I want God to get a hold of my life and and and straighten me up oh what a blessing tonight to be able to recognize our mistakes if there's something off-kilter to look into God's word and see where it's telling us where don't measure up and so many people are blind to their predicament in Proverbs 26:12 it says do you see a person wise in their own eyes there's more hope for a fool than for them Proverbs 12:15 says the way of fool seems right to them but the wise listen to advice a wise man will listen to the words of the the word when it tells you you need to be born again or tells you you need to straighten up live a Sanctified life in Luke 18 it says this is the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector and the story The Pharisee was self-righteous and did not recognize his own need for forgiveness while the tax collector humbly acknowledged his sinfulness and sought God's mercy it's really worse to stubbornly refuse to admit your failure than to stumble and fall his word is what we are to measure ourselves with brother Ram will say we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them yes sir but you see it's following his rules right following what he said do following what he said what did he say to do to believe him to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said you must be born again that's what he said you got to do what do you got to do get up and give it your all surrender everything to him surrender everything so that God can use you he said now look Adam and Eve in a position to never die in a position to never be old to never be sick to never have a worry you say I sure wish I could be like that I got news for you you are in the same position God places that to every creature on the earth in the same position what was the agreement if you'll keep my words keep my words why cuz we not going to be one word off what what are his words you got to be born again amen be dressed right live holy go to church do unto others forgive others forgive others that your sins might be forgiven put God first don't put anything else before God rise up early in the morning and give God that a long time instead of jumping right on social media put God before all of your Idols put God before everything else put God before your family put God before your church you put your church or somebody at church up on an idol where you're looking at them instead of God and you're spending all that time trying to please somebody else instead of pleasing God but put God first don't lie cheat or steal keep his words keep all those words that he's laid out for us in the Bible for us to live a happy life and you know if you don't lie cheat or steal you'll live a happy life you'll live a life where people can look at you within as a man or a woman of Integrity somebody they can have confidence in somebody they can have trust trust that when they tell you something or confide in you that you're not going to go blab it out to somebody else that you can be a trustworthy individual that you can keep a secret y that you can be trusted with confidence and you know nobody can believe the devil's lie because the devil's got all his lies nobody can believe the devil's lie until they disbelieve God's truth I I I was thinking today I just going meditating on what brother Ram said here that Satan don't have nothing to give but he makes all these promises anyway brother Bram said here he said Satan will make you all kind of promises but he has nothing to give you because he don't have nothing he don't have no salvation what is Satan anything contrary to the word he doesn't have salvation he doesn't have light his kingdom is Darkness the end thereof is death darkness and death is Satan's kingdom the only way to stay in Divine Fellowship is to keep his word I think the word is is the word is everything to us if you get off the word your your life is on a slippery slope Jesus said in John 15:7 he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen now those are the words layer on on the page but if you believe that and you have confidence in that it it's got to be true in Psalm 119 1-2 he said blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the the law of the Lord blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart blessed are those who want what God Said and are willing to surrender themselves to it surrender to the word to be able to admit when they've done wrong to admit when they're walking wrong when they're not doing right to straighten their lives up to live right and to walk right and do right in Psalm 119 : 889 it says forever oh Lord Thy word is settled in heaven Thy word is settled in heaven and the Oneness and fellowship back there when Adam and Eve were in the garden was broke between God and his children the minute that Eve disbelieved one little paragraph one little word of God she disbelieved maybe maybe like sitting here this afternoon if you disbelieve that you can be healed if you disbel that you can have peace so you're not going to have peace like that but you set your mind set your thoughts on what God Said and you watch God begin to work in your life you begin to think that I don't believe he's going to be able to back up his promises oh but on the contrary if you believe that God will back up his promises and come like Paul said come boldly to the throne of grace you watch and see if God do back up his word that's right you begin to think that God don't care or he's not the same today as he was yesterday and and there's that middle wall between you but God tore down that wall he wants you to have Union with him so that he can fulfill these promises that he is the same yesterday today and forever he's still the same look that you can't be happy without without God there's no way to have true joy and peace without God that's the only way and then in every man woman boy and girl there's that thirst that thirst that's can only be quenched by God something in you where you know you got to have it something that's something that's draw in you there's got to be something to quench this thirst and all the drugs and alcohol and cigarettes and all of those things they'll never satisfy this thirst because there's only one thirst that can satisfy this and that's God there's only one thing disbelieving God disbelieving God's word causes everything to fall fall apart and we'll stop there as the musicians come forward God promised to bring us back into Fellowship back into Unity back into Oneness and that's the reason you got to be in Union with God to let God have his way with you to surrender to him and allow the word to have pre imess in your life God's word is truth and everything the devil has is lies that's all he's got it's just a lot of lies but we've got the truth laying here in the pages of the Bible God bless you Saints let's stand to our feet and Just Praise Him and worship him and let's go to the KY D I surrender all all to Jesus I surrender all to him freely give I will won't you just surrender yourself to it meditate on his words and on his promises his oh think about how much he cares for you God loves you and he cares for you Just Surrender yourself to surrender all all to thee my blessed savior I surrender all to Jesus I oh [Music] God at his [Music] think about Abel that story ofel that brother Ram told he wanted God wanted able to get up on that sacrifice on that altar with his sacrifice and be identified with it Sur and that's the same way with you and I he wants us to be identified with our sacrifice to die out to the things of this world and of our own mind and surrender everything to him his savior I surrender all All to Jesus I Surrender make me savior holy th let me feel the Holy Spirit Tru know that thou are mine I surrender [Music] all I surrender you

amen we got to surrender to him cuz we just just can't do it ourselves I was uh reading that quote um where brother Adam said the reason that he gave the law to the Jews to was to prove that nobody could keep it you can't keep it you need God to keep it you need God to live it out in you cuz we can't do it we can't do nothing of ourselves we need him that's why we got to surrender let's just pray and then we'll we sing another song as we're dismissed Lord God we're so grateful for your word to that you given unto us Lord the word that you sent to to loose to to to make a way for your spirit to work in our lives Lord Jesus I pray Lord that maybe maybe tonight as your Saints go home Lord God that these e words will echo in their hearts that they'll remember these things as they drive home they'll think about them in the coming days Lord Jesus and if they haven't surrendered everything to you Lord I pray that their heart will be pricked yes Lord Lord that they'll begin to draw and Lord you'll pull them back to yourself Lord Jesus you want us to be fully surrendered Lord God surrender everything to you Lord God I pray God that you'll guide your Saints Lord as they go
