Wednesday and uh Romans chapter 3 and then we're going to go to First Corinthians chapter 10. and so we're going to read a few scriptures there and before we read the scripture at night let's just all bow our heads and speak to the author heavenly father and Lord Lord we're just so thankful tonight Lord to be back in your house Lord and Lord we're just so thankful Lord for what you've done for us Lord that you've brought us this far Lord we didn't we didn't lead ourselves Lord we didn't save ourselves Lord but it's just by your mercy and Grace Lord that we've come this far Lord you've brought us and Lord you're the one that does the work Lord we just have to yield ourselves to it Lord and Lord we're just so thankful Lord for that that healing stream Lord the flow of Calvary Lord that shed blood Lord that Lord not only does it does it it's it can heal Lord but it can it can wash us clean Lord Jesus Lord it keeps us clean Lord and what a wonderful thing that we have or all we've got to do is believe that's just what you asked us to do if all the Lord just help our unbelief tonight Lord as we look into the scripture Lord that we should know these things and Lord as Paul said I would not have you be ignorant of these things Lord just to stir up our minds in a way of remembrance to look at these things and remember these things that are in the scripture Lord just anoint our hearts

bless the bride around the world Lord father touch brother Louise and brother Bob and the lord of the ones since they're working and laboring there and and Nicaragua Lord and Lord just blessed their

sickness Lord there's no no issues that they run into Lord but it's just been a a wonderful trip a smooth trip Lord Jesus you know we know that your hand will be upon them until they come back home Lord and I know they're getting tired in their bodies Lord Jesus after so many days or just continue to touch them Lord and refresh them in their bodies Lord Lord bless your bride around the world we pray we commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Romans chapter 3 verse 19. it says now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be the just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus and then we'll turn over to First Corinthians chapter 10. and verse 1. it says moreover Brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and it eat I'll eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness amen God bless you you have your seats this evening and just going to continue on from where we were at last Wednesday and speaking on to know and and not be ignorant of here and Romans chapter 3 we know that in the in the and Paul's peeking up here in in Romans 3 and and he begins to talk about the the Jews and you know he says there's no benefit they they asked what was the benefit of of the Jews he said really the only thing was they received the Oracles of God they received the they received the law but it didn't do them any any benefit because if they didn't have faith to believe in in what what God had said the word that was given to them it didn't benefit them and then he was as he continues on he begins to talk about you know there's there's no benefit because even the Gentiles who didn't God didn't even deal with the Gentiles and they were alienated from God and they were cut off and we were under sin because of we didn't have a way back so we were understanding but they had given were given the law but because of the law only brought them to a knowledge it didn't bring them into a perfect uh relationship with God it didn't it didn't cover them so that's the reason he said that when the law was given he said that the law was given that nobody has a it says unto them that are under law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God now through the through the law you actually realize that you're guilty you you become you realize who you where you're at and so when you see that you you've become guilty through that that when you see when you see those then you realize that no no Deeds that you can do under the law is ever going to justify you but when you don't realize when you realize that there's nothing that you can do the only thing that you have is the righteousness of God so you have to accept the righteousness of God and through that you can become perfect before God and you can come into the right condition before God but that's the only thing it takes it takes faith in what God has what God has done and not anything that you can do and so when the when the scripture talks about the children of Israel when they begin to walk in the journey they had to have faith in what God Said and that was that was the same problem that they you know that they had was when they when the word was given to them for them to follow it they did not have faith in what God had said and he says and many of them were overthrown why because they didn't walk by faith because they walked by the things that they saw and he said it's the same thing with us that we have to have and realize that there's nothing that nothing you're going to do I I thank God there's nothing there's nothing that I can do to take me out and there's nothing that I can do to put me in it's all by God's grace it's because what God has done for me I just accept that you know uh you know many times I've seen people that you know they they go and you know the Lord begins to deal with them and the first thing they do is they they want to get baptized you know they want to follow the scriptural process and understand this is what I need to do and they go get baptized well you know what that's a good that's a good outward work that's something that you do as a as a showing but you know water doesn't change you baptism doesn't change you and you know because we understand that because of the uh the nature of a person when you're when you're born you have that fall in nature water baptism is not going to clean you it's not it's showing what that God has begun to do a work in you and you're taking God at his word and you're going to follow God's word because there's something that you I see that I need to be baptized why because that's God's word and I'm going to fulfill God's word but many times the problem is is when they go to the water and they get baptized and they come up then they expect that everything's going no it is God has to there is a the justification doesn't come by water justification comes by faith in God's word when we take God at his word that he can justify us that's what he that's what Paul is saying here so you justification comes by faith and God cuts off our past sins God doesn't remember those anymore and then he says that we are as a outward showing that God is doing a work in us we go to the water showing that we're laying the old man down and we're coming back up but the problem is is that old man is still there you're still dealing with the old man you still got to fight that old thing and many times people get get discouraged because when they go into the water and they come up they expect some miraculous Miracle to take place well sometimes it does for some people and other people you know what they go down and they come back up and they still got to fight the same Spirits they got to fight the same Devils that they did before they went in the water and not realizing that I'm continuing to walk by faith and I'm going to put my faith in God well then guess what I still gotta I still gotta overcome the same devil that that I saw when I walked down under the water you know what because you know it's not like the devil gets slick and he falls off you're not going to wash him off but what does it take it takes the word it takes you know what I have because that is part of the word and I continue to walk by that and then the other part of that is walking and continuing in the word and feeding on the word and meditating on the word and being in the word and believing What God Says and many times it's Society it's the same process that we go through we read the scripture there are things we don't understand but you know what we hold them before God we still hold them before God and waiting on him to Quicken it to us for him to reveal it to us but it's the same process you just keep going and you keep feeding on it and what do you have to do you've got to step away from the things and lay aside all the things that you had before you can't go to the same places that you went before you can't be in you can't see the same things that you saw before you can't talk the same people that you talked to before because you know it's just like people when they when they go to you know you see people that go in into a rehab situation or whatever when you go into this place and you're trying to do these things it's good but the problem is is you've got to lay that old thing down you've got to move on to something else and it's the same way with God when you lay down your the problems and I'm stepping in I'm walking forward with God you know I can't go back and talk the same thing I talked before you know the thing is because when when I put my faith in Jesus Christ and I say you know what I am I am saved because I have faith in God then you know what I should never talk the devil's language I don't know if God's going to do it you know what if God done it one time and if he's ever done it because you know what he brought all the people through the Bible all the people that he's ever brought through and you know what if you want to find a fake if you want to find somebody then you'll find somebody real somewhere you if you can find a counterfeit that there's got to be a genuine somewhere and every time the day will appoint you to somebody that falls and fails and is a little you know a Slicker or whatever else but you know what you'll always find somebody that is true to the word you will find a true genuine Christian and you'll find somebody so you can look at it and say well this person was this way and you can't no you got to get your eyes because if you want to see what God God just didn't come and write a book but he come and he manifested himself into people you know because anytime you want to fight you can find somebody that's true to God's word that's a true Christian now that doesn't mean that they don't have faults and failures they don't have problems but you know what you'll see somebody that knows how to overcome somebody knows how to handle their problems why because you know it's because if somebody's come through and you're a real true Christian then the thing is as God begins to work through you and then as as brother Wade's been preaching on you come through faith and then you've got to have virtue and knowledge you want because those virtues are being built into you and then you begin to display them not not just to have them and say well look what I've got no you display them to other people to be edifying to the body God doesn't do just anything just to be doing it but it's all for the body one of the things I just want to thank I was preaching on it brother JT says you know as a body as the the body has a Ministry we all have a Ministry we all have a part to play and you know everybody's like well you know I don't have somebody well God didn't call me to be somebody else God didn't call me to be in the same spot as somebody else he called me to be in my spot and the problem is is I got to be faithful to what God called me to be I came I can't be somebody else and you can't be me thank the Lord that you don't have to be me but you know what God only called us to who we are supposed to be and that's all God wants us to be is faithful told the calling that we have and so then we the part of that calling is to show people Jesus Christ and so when we're when when you're walking then you can find somebody that's genuine and God will give you somebody somebody will put somebody somewhere along your path that'll speak to you that you'll see Jesus Christ in them you know sometimes it's not just the preacher but you know thank God we've had we've had Godly Parents we've had we've had Holyfield holy ghost-filled parents that were able to raise us so we know who we know what what the Life of Christ is we know what the love of God is why because we were we were that was manifested to us they were showed us the Life of Christ to raise us up and then sometimes people didn't come from backgrounds like that but you know there's oh I've never met anybody that didn't have a that's not had a Christian Journey somewhere in their life that somebody God didn't put somebody across their path to speak to them it wasn't always a preacher it wasn't always a deacon I think about brother biscoll one time and he was talking about that his dad was watching this woman and she was uh you know just just a housewife out washing clothes and doing different things but he said he kept watching that woman's life and brother Biscoe said his dad's watched that woman's life so much he said because just by her life was her testimony he said there was something about that woman that was something different about her and he said you know what it began to create a thirst in him it created a desire in him until he got to the place he had to go talk to that woman to find out what is it that makes you different and he said that's how his dad got saved was because he saw it wasn't just just you know just anybody but it was something about this one why because God was there because she was a Christian the love of God was being manifested the Life of Christ was being manifest and when you see how those things begin to be brought out then that's the same thing with you and I it's it should be us when as the song says you know uh I I love this song and it says when they looked they beheld him when I spoke they could hear him when I walked my every footstep brought them all to Calvary if if our if our life doesn't match that if if people can't see Jesus Christ then you know what we need we need to get in the altar because every that's our goal in life not to how much money we can make or or all these type things but can the world see Jesus Christ in US can the world see who who Christ is that he's the same yesterday today and forever but you know when when you begin to walk in this journey you know God's going to bring you somebody and you're going to continue to walk well then you know what you don't look at all the the peripheral things you lay all that aside and you put your faith and trust in God and God begins to walk with you and he begins to deal with you and you know that and it doesn't matter because he is the one that's overcome says he overcome the world everything in the world he's overcome and so when when he begins to lead us and guide us then you know what we have the same opportunity to overcome everything we don't have to hold on to the Past we don't have to hold on to things that hold us back but we can move on because you know what God is a god of Deliverance God is a god of Miracles because the Bible is full of Miracles and you know what he's the same yesterday today and forever so if he's ever done a miracle then you know what he's still the same and if anybody has ever been saved if anybody has ever been delivered and any time in point in history if you make the same conditions then he's obligated to do the same thing because brother Brown says he's not a respecter of persons but he is a respecter of faith God respects faith and that's what causes God to move is faith but see when the children of Israel when they begin to walk they begin to look at all the things that were all around them that when the children of Israel when God sent Moses down there sent a prophet with a message who was Vindicated to bring them out everything that they had neither was given to him but the problem is is they they didn't walk by faith they began to walk and then all of a sudden they had all the issues that they saw all around them but they didn't say that God was there leading them that God spoke to them and when you when you began to say how we were speaking last time when when they the children of Israel began to see all the things that they had went through God delivered them all the way they fed them to clothe them all the Miracles that took place when the greatest the greatest Empire when the greatest nation in all the world was tore up and and destroyed and collapsed in front of their eyes when they had seen all those miracles and then when they came out and they complained and God parted the Red Sea and they walked across on dry land all the way that they had led all the Miracles they took place and they stood there and couldn't believe that God well I don't know if God can do this or not he brought them all this way and he kept showing them that he's the god of Miracles that he was gonna that he was going to lead them and every time that was a problem you know what he he overlooked their unbelief and he brought them forward until they came to kadish Barney after he brought him all of that way until they came to the Judgment seat the Judgment seat of God and then he couldn't Overlook their their sin anymore they had to believe and it come to the place they had to agree with the word and they had to take it by faith and many times it comes to the same thing you and I we've got to come to a place that we've got to sell out to to this word and there's nothing else in this world we've got to lay everything else aside lay every weight and every sin aside and sell out to nothing but this word and have our complete confidence in God and His word that he's going to lead us through but we have to believe what God Said he said he he said he God honors believers and even even when people don't know which way to go and sometimes sometimes we take the wrong road sometimes we do do the wrong thing because you know what sometimes we're ignorant how many times have we done things and it's like well I thought this was right and we're just doing the best we can as brother Brown talked about those those people going out they went to totem poles and witches and everything else and God honored their faith why because they followed what they that's all they knew and they walked in and God honored their faith well you know sometimes we we believe things that were wrong you know some of us some of us believed in the Trinity and different things there's a lot of things that that we didn't that well we didn't agree you know didn't see but you know what it was God's grace that kept leading us and there would come a time in our life that he began to deal with us and show us what the truth was and then he began to show oh I see that well you know what that that makes sense and then all of a sudden when it begins to open up then you know I can walk in that and you know when when it begins to oh the word begins to open up it's like hey I can rejoice in that because I can see that that makes sense and then there's more to go and then all of a sudden the more you go and the more you feed then there's more to open up and sometimes sometimes you the word will begin to open up to you one little thing will open up and then sometimes the Lord don't speak to you for a while why because he's going to see what you're going to do you know many times as I I was speaking you know when when different things happen and we see why things go certain ways and we don't understand it you know just like Elijah's sitting there at the brook Sheriff you know when when all the famine and all the things was going on God had a place for his Prophet to go to and it's it's interesting when you read that story The widow woman's down there going and starving to death just trying to make it with what little bit she's got and you know when she when she's in there and there's no rain in the land and you can see all the death and destruction all around there there's no rain there's no Earth and everything's drying up there's death all around all the things that she was she saw and you know what it began to weigh on her that you know what that's what that was her path that's exactly the way she that was inevitable for her she was going to die also she didn't have any she didn't have any water everything was drying up and it was and she's sitting there every single day looking in that Mill barrel and it's just her and her son but you know what the prophet was off somewhere by a a creek by the Brook and he's he's eating and drinking and having having a great time now the Lord the Lord supernaturally feeding him he's he's got water and he's enjoying himself and sometimes in our lives we wonder why and sometimes you know it's we're like the widow woman or sometimes we're like Elijah you know there's times that God brings us into places and it's like we're just there and sometimes we we begin to see the situation that we're in and not realizing God's got us in a place that he wants to feed you he wants to water you he wants to comfort you he wants to arrest you but sometimes we get we get anxious in those places why we said we don't see the Lord moving we don't but you know what sometimes the Lord has to open our eyes and realize hey God because you know there's been times in my life when when things have happened and people you know you wonder what's going on and how things are going it's like well sometimes this may be the brook cherith we're just sitting here waiting on God so I'm just going to look and I'm not because I'm not going to get anxious about it because sometimes and and you look back over your life and sometimes when you go through situations in your life and and things and it looks bad and and you get worked up and you know what realize God's on the scene and God's working but you don't see that but you're but you'll get worked up and you'll be anxious and and you'll get nervous and you'll worry about things and you know what not realizing later when you look back you know God had it all under control but we didn't have faith in God to realize that we were sitting in a place that God wanted us to be but you know there was that widow woman sitting down there the whole time and God knew what what she was going through God knew what she was facing that she was down there in the midst of all of that death and destruction and what she was facing but you know when it came the appointed time he sent the prophet to her and he gave her a word and not only did he just speak the word to her but he gave her something to do so when he when he spoke to the the widow woman you know then he come down there and said give me a drink well that wasn't that wasn't a problem to give him a drink the problem was she had a little bit of a problem when she was going to have to get in that milk barrel and give him a little bit of some bread it's like listen I you know we're running out down here I don't know if you know we're in a famine but you know in the midst of that God God through the prophet told her said listen just make me a little one first hate him on all of it he just wanted her to have faith and uh and work and and so move forward in that brother Brian said you've got to do something for God to honor and so when you do something what she does she made that cake and she give it to him then what it then what Elijah tell her said listen it's never going to run out in the midst of all of this drought and all of this it's never gonna run out you're never going to you're never gonna go dry you're always going to have it just by following what God wants you to do right and it's the same way with you and I you know if we put our faith and our confidence in God you know we always go and God always has something for us not to worry and and fret and and all these things but just put our trust in God and then all of a sudden when he come to that place that she gave them you know what she always had just by her little portion have faith to give it so when we have that when God calls us into those places and into whatever situation is if we can just put our trust in God and do what God wants us to do how how small or how how looming or large it seems sometimes but you know if you just honor God with what God has asked of you and you know I was thinking about where brother Brown was talking about the children the uh over season you know he was talking about the all those people coming and you know they had a desire to see and hear just one word from God and all and all those Stone you know the storms and different things like that and he was talking about you know as the story I was telling last last week you know here they are in those in those storms and and the Heat and all that kind of stuff and he said they just want to hear one word from God and they went through all of that to go stand there spent all day standing in the hot sun or braving rain storms or whatever it is just to stand there just for brother Branham to come and say and just speak one word from God piled up just stacked up the sick people and everything why because they just knew that if he had just come then they were expecting something from God and it's the same it's the same thing you know you know no matter how bad the storm gets no matter how many the problems get whatever it may be that we come through in our lives if we can just if we can just continue to do just like they done because you know it like brother Wade's always said you know you see people when when they have problems hit their lives and they have troubles and and different trials and different things like that the first thing they do is they leave church when when those things happen no when when the problems get to the point where you get it feels like you can't make it and it become unbearable that's the time you need to be in church you don't need to be away from church you need to be in church how many how many times have you been in and just from your own personal experience I know for me but how many times have you been where you you either you're so sick that you you that you just don't feel you just don't feel like you can make it through the door or you whatever the problem you've got so many problems that that you're burdened with something or you know you're just frustrated whatever it is that you're facing and you're and you come to the house of God and you're just you're just so tore down with everything all this is upon you and when you come in the house of God the first thing that whatever is said sometimes it's a song that are sunk when they begin to sing the songs of Zion all of a sudden something changes inside of you and it begins to speak to you and to speak to your situation and you know you know what you've been blessed just to be in the house of God just walk through the door and sing the songs and the word ain't even preached you ain't even heard the word but something begins why because you're in the atmosphere and it's soon because when you begin to worship God and you get into that atmosphere then God can come and speak to you but the problem is is you get in the wrong atmosphere and you get weighted down then you can't God can't deal with you but all of a sudden you get in the house of God and all of a sudden the songs begin to sing and you can you can be mad you can be sad whatever it may be but you get into the presence of God and he you begin to sing then all of a sudden something begins to change inside of you and and sometimes you may you may not even make it through the song service I know I I know I've led singing before and it's like the first song the second song the third song and I mean it's just like you're fighting a battle the whole time it's like trying to push a great weight up a hill and he's like well you know what I could just quit but you know what it's you just continue to press and you continue to press and all of a sudden as you keep on just worshiping the Lord and you keep going because sometimes sometimes it's uh you know for those who've ever led singing sometimes it's a wonderful experience I mean the presence of the Lord drops down and it's like you could sing all night long it's just wonderful and other times you're fighting a battle up here and you're just really it's just like a but you know sometimes all of a sudden you just keep pressing press and pressing and all of a sudden you break through and all of a sudden then you realize that whatever whatever was holding the spirit back in the service whatever it was it breaks and all of a sudden then the presence the Lord begins to move in this in the church why because you know what as the old saying there is a blessing and pressing because if you begin to press your way in because you have to press your way into the kingdom of God if you begin to press and all of a sudden you're going to get a blessing because all of a sudden you're going to overcome that you just keep pressing you keep pressing you get into that it's the same way sometimes the same way we're preaching sometimes when you start out it's like you're trying it's sometimes it's a real struggle it's really hard but you know what you just keep on because it's not me I'm not trying to preach it's yielding myself and if I can just get myself out of the way that he can preach and you operate the gift because sometimes you know it's not just looking at who's up here because if we didn't see if we didn't see a vessel up here if we just realize it's God speaking it doesn't matter if if the person was illiterate didn't matter who they were because you know Peter and John were ignorant and unlearned but you know what they knew that they hadn't experienced because they had knew they had been with Jesus they had had an experience in their life that changed who they were now this is um Hebrews 4 verses 1 and 2 says let us therefore fear lest the promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being Faith mixed with faith in them that heard it so it takes because we have to have just like them the word was preached but they did not mix it with faith when they what they heard they did not follow because God was going to lead them and all the time God kept proving to them that he was leading them and yet they did not mix it with faith and it's the same way with you and I if we want to enter in then we've got to mix it with faith and from Jehovah Jireh above says let me give you a scripture first see with what we do it must be scriptural got to be scriptural God won't honor nothing else God won't honor a lie you know that you couldn't attach that to him he don't honor lives he only honors his word but he promised that my word will not return to me voice it'll accomplish that which it was purpose for and we say the word that's lauded today no matter how much unbelief rises in the camp God will honor his word when he find Faith to honor it by so when to have faith to believe what God says then he will honor our faith but that's what we got to have we got to believe what God told us what God has said and then we then God will honor that all the way through if we take it and mix it with faith believe what God has said it's always been the same way this is from the permanent Church age there he said he said with so many dishonoring God turning him into three gods and changing his gracious name to titles he said one would wonder if the signs and wonders that attend such a great name would still be visited among the people and did those peop those signs were mightily and wonderfully manifested through certainly not in the false Vine he said men like Martin were greatly used of God and bore them witness both by signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost the name was still effectual as it always has been and ever will be where the Saints honor him through his word and Faith so as long as we have see we've got to take the only thing that God's going to honor is his faith and you have faith in God's word then he will do what he said he's going to do but you've got to continue to follow in what he said and all the all the things through the scriptures that we look at it's them taking what God had said and then when he when they take it what God had said then we see the Miracles take place we see the things that take place brother Brown speaking later on he was uh talking about Paul and you know he said it was the people that had faith in what Paul's bought in the aprons and the things the handkerchiefs that were taken it was their faith in God that it wasn't Paul that was able to do Miracles but it was their faith in God through Paul that they could lay in the in the in the shadow of Peter it wasn't it wasn't Peter that they had faith in it was God that they saw God in Peter that they could lay in the shadows of them and they took those aprons from the body of Paul and those unclean spirits went out why because they had faith in God the the faith that that the god that Paul preached they had faith in that to believe that they could take that from him and they could they could have the Miracles take place the the healings and different things that were taking place that come through that why because they had faith in God by by what they had seen and it wasn't who you know because you know you they had to get past who Paul was you know it was like you know some people go out there you know you still got blood on your hands someplace somebody had to get past that they had to get past the point of what Paul was you know when he was saw what he done in the past when he began to talk about you know all the things I was a blasphemer but I'd done it in ignorance all the things that he was talking about all the things that he had done in his life I'm the least in the Kingdom because I persecuted the church but you know he said but it was God's grace to me that I could be where I'm at today and when he begins to talk about those things and he said and he talks about all the things that have went through all all the murderers and all the things that that had taken place and he said such were some of you when he began to talk about you know but now you're clean now you're Justified why because all those things have been put away by the washing of the water of the word all those things have cleaned you you know you don't have to hold on to those things anymore you know I'd like you said you know he said now he said laying aside all these things he said I pressed toward the Mark I've got to lay all these things aside and that's the same way with you and I we can always you know there's many people in this world and and they get offended one time in their life or or whatever something something comes up and you know they'll never get past that they hold on to that for the rest of their life you'll never grow as a Christian holding on trying to hold grudges and hold on to what took place years ago you'll never get past that you got to lay it all aside why because you know you know as as Christians our goal is to make sure that everybody makes it he's like well you know what you just wait we're going to get to the Great White throne and I'm gonna make sure you go to hell because you know I got I got that well guess what you know what um I wouldn't back my Bank on going to heaven you may be over there waiting somebody stand at the white Throne trying to get mercy and Grace hey man because you know that's not that's not the life of God that's not the spirit of God to have it to have any but that's the way some people are you know you know as brother Brown said you know our desire is that I'll make it the scripture says that God was willing that none should perish but that all might come to repentance and so it's always as brother Branham said you know when when they care they said well brother Bradham we don't agree with your Doctrine and we don't agree with this and we're just going to draw you outside of our Circle because we don't want you well brother Brown said well don't worry brother I love you anyway and I'm gonna draw you back in because guess what you can draw your circle and I can draw a bigger Circle and if you you draw me out again I can just draw a bigger Circle you can't draw me out because there's one thing there's one thing about it brother talking about you know there's one you you can do something to me but you know you can't whatever you do the way I react to it is the way I react to it and you can't control that so if if you do something to me and you offend me then you know what I can forgive you and love you anyway and guess what you can't stop me from doing that [Applause] because you know what you can you can do whatever and and but you can't stop what I do because that's what that's the way that's the way that God is that's the way that's the way the word is because you know he's always reaching out and he's going to reach out because you know he's always reaching out until there's there's no until you're cut off but it's not God cutting you off you sent away your day of Grace you cut him off when Cain when Cain come before God and God began to speak to Cain he had to access God made a way for him and told him which way to go light it out perfectly for him but you know what it was it was Kane's decision not to follow God's word so when he decided hey I'm not going to do what you say I'm gonna do my own thing the you know what that was his choice God didn't cut him off and you know and if God didn't make a way for Cain to come if he said listen he said if you do as your brother he said you'll be accepted if he didn't if he didn't believe that and he didn't say was not honest when he said that can you imagine God's a liar he said well you know God could you know no it wasn't God cutting cane off can't cut himself off and it's the same way with you and I he's made the way and but you've got to turn it down brother Bradham said we fight our way all the way to hell you got to step he said you got to step over the blood of Jesus Christ to get to hell that's a that's a that's a powerful statement I gotta fight my way I got a struggle and I've got to work my way into hell because why because he's made a way and he stand there and he's trying to reach out to you but you know what I'm gonna if I'm you know it's not like you just on a slippery slope not like everybody says well you know God's got you roasting over hell like a on a hot dog like oh no string he just barely got you dangling over hell you know you just buy this little string and you know you're just ready to he's ready to throw you in the fire where everybody's like you know you got this big God he's got this great big hammer over top of your head and he's just waiting for you to mess up saying whack you in the head he just walks around like this just but you know what as as brother Dale always said you if you understand God and you understand who he is you realize he said he chastens he corrects with nail print hands nail scarred hands you know God is so loving and kind but he's a just God but you know what he has a way for you but you know you turn it down and he oh and so many times we we have fallen and failed and and we have come short but you know what God is always there to bring us back he's always there to bring us back and show us the way to come but you know you've got to come that way and this is from the message expectation he says now just believe him tonight and he will do the same way for he's no respect of persons he's respecting Faith he said God will honor Faith even your salvation sometimes won't atone for your healing not the merits of your salvation you're not healed by that you're healed by the Merit of your faith he said I've seen Christians come to the platform renowned Christians and fail to get healed and see a prostitute walk on the platform be healed instantly see because the Christian had been drugged through of many places and skeptic kind of believing wonder if the days of Miracles has passed and they'll go off missing it and a poor old prostitute come to the platform knowing that she's guilty condemned before God and their Giver heart to Christ and be healed instantly and just walk away so it's on the Merit of your faith look in the times of Jesus how the Pharisees and Sadducees they walked by and doubted and the street women and so forth of that day and so forth and the Beggars and things would be healed where many of the others didn't get healed see it was on the merits of your faith so it's just so simple how things and not why because the people that when they walked before Jesus they didn't worry about what they had done because they realized who they were they realize who they were because they didn't have their own uh self-evaluation that that you know they were so good because when they realized God is greater than who I am when they walked before Jesus you know and realize hey I'm I'm worthless I'm I'm I don't have anything I'm not good enough but you know what he's greater than that he's great so that I can put my confidence in him not at not looking at the things that of of my life or the things I've done but realize he's greater than that and then when that when they come by then he could that he can do something for them that I'm not trying to do it by my own by my own merits but realizing who he is and this is from the Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever he was talking about the prayer lines he says then he says as soon as the Holy Spirit starts to work as many of you've been in the meetings well then it moves to the audience everywhere to where the people are that sick and Afflicted they're healed he said by their own personal faith in Christ nothing I have in myself to do it I'm just your brother that's all he said but Christ their faith in Christ does the healing and they said and now each evening talks about them passing out the prayer cards get them out every day fresh and then sometimes when we get a lot of cards out we'll have a line get our ministering Brethren to line up lines and pray for the sick all of them he said we take up the cards and just show you that God hears any Minister's prayer anybody's prayer don't have to be a minister you can pray for the sick God will honor your prayer see what is it it is it a faith in the finished work of the Lord Jesus so if you just have faith because whatever he's done it's a finished work it's finished and if you just put Faith in what God has already done what he's already said many times when I as I've said before when I pray for people it's a finished work I thank the Lord you know I pray over somebody and say thank the Lord because it's a finished work I all I'm doing is is doing what he said lay hands on people I'm just fulfilling the scripture but he's already done the healing he's already done the delivery he's already done whatever you have need of whatever you come for it and when you've prayed for somebody and you and you agree with somebody touching anything it's already done I'm just agreeing with you then if and if then if it doesn't take place then you know we need to stop and find out what the problem is why is it why is it that we've not had the the Deliverance or the healing or whatever it is that takes place why because there's something wrong in the body there's something wrong that if we don't if we if we if somebody comes up here and doesn't get healed then what is it then there's something there's some kind of problem then it should have we should be in desperation his brother Branham said here's a first John chapter 2 and it says but whosoever keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to work even as he walked now brother random speaking in in the uh message the perfect Faith he begins to talk he said when when Satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith in a perfect word like Jesus did he said the word of God is perfect we're to have perfect faith in this perfect word and resist Satan and he continues he said by his faith and his word it conquers we can conquer anything both death hell and the grave we know that God is God what that perfect faith in God's perfect word he conquered everything he came in contact with God could not death could not even stand in his presence could not uh sickness could not stand in his presence but then he continues to drop down he said there he was walking walking in a world with perfect Faith because he was the word he said and now he said if ye abide in me through him he brought the word to you praise the Lord he brought the word to you if you abide in me he said in my words abide in you he said then walk in the same kind of a way virtues flowing from you the rivers of God's Fountains of blessings just flowing out of the people see what I mean and you're not bluffing it you're not imagine it it's actually taking place and you see it if you're just imagining that won't do any good but if it's really there it really happened and it's really amazing when you see that because if we understand see if you about he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you he said then you walk the same kind of walk that he walked that he had a place did he realized who he was and he walked in a in a path a perfect faith and a realm of perfect faith and realizing you know if if I'm in him then you know I'm not I'm not resting on me I'm not resting on my ideas I'm not resting on anything I've done but I realize that if I'm in him and he's in me that you know I could walk the same kind of walk oh well I don't know about that no it's true because that's what he's saying he said if you can see that he said you walk the same kind of walk the virtue's flowing from you why because that was that was Jesus Christ right there in the flesh the FL the virtues were coming out so he had Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience all of those were in Jesus Christ being being made manifest and if it were and if you're in him then you know what you can have the same thing flowing out of you and he said you know because if something if you've got a if you've got something that's full of water and you put a crack in there you turn a a hose on or something like that you don't have to worry about trying you've never had to pull water out of anything I I've I've never had to pull water out of anything all that's doing is there and it's just looking for an Avenue to come out how many times some of y'all if you've ever worked in maintenance you'll know this brother boy don't know this you're working on something and you think you got it all under control and all of a sudden there's a pipe break and the next thing you know you get baptized standing up you think you think I've got this under control this is going to be all right well somehow it breaks loose and next thing you know sometimes it ain't always water but you get covered in something but you know what you don't ever ever have to try to coax it out you don't ever have to wait on them because you know what as soon as there is an Avenue for it to flow it's coming out and it's the same way with the Holy Spirit if the holy spirit is in us then you know we don't have to try to coax it out we don't have to try to pull that why because it flows out so that's the way it is he said say though it's a he said the rivers of God's Fountains of blessing just flowing out to the people now that's that's the kind of life that God has has promised us that's that's what he promised us that can be us not just no we're just waiting on brother Dale or brother Wade no every single person every believer every born-again believer has the same opportunity to have the virtues flowing out but it takes it's the same beginning it's the same faith that he walked in do we really if you are in him and he's in you and you abide in his words then that's what can take place see he said and you're not bluffing it you're not imagining it it actually taking place then you actually can't have those things it's not it's not just a hope so maybe so I think so you know no because it's something that's really truly happening now when when people see then you actually see these things take place if we because sometimes when we see those things it's like well I I don't know no if you get the first inkling in your mind that that well that's I don't know if you get a little bit of uncertainty in your mind then see that's the problem because when you begin to read the scripture and you begin to see those things and it it's it's to you and it's to flow out of you it's a promise and the first thing in my well you know I've done this and I've done that and you know and and then all of a sudden you start dealing in in the realm well that's one of the things that you've got to overcome you got to overcome your reasoning you've got to overcome your memory all those things why because those things are contrary to the law of God they're contrary to the word of God when he begins you know because as as as Hattie Wright was sitting there in the different ones but you know just like Hattie Wright was sitting there and when brother Brandon began to speak about those squirrels being being created and all those things and God began to speak to him why because he didn't understand the scripture because he had some kind of issue you know because I didn't understand he said if you say these mountains be moved and not doubt in your heart and he began to think about and God began to deal with him on the scripture and he began to meditate on the scripture on what the scripture says and then when the god began to speak to him and then he said you know you and you can speak squirrels they said you need some squirrels you need something to eat here how many squirrels do you want well you know it's like I I don't know about this God you know what brother Brandon didn't argue with God he didn't try to try to reason it out he was like okay and I'm just gonna walk forward I'm just you know how many how many do you need he said well three makes a good mess right so he began to speak about well there's three and he said where are they going to be at then you know what he didn't he didn't argue with God he didn't try to reason it out he just began to walk in what God was showing him and he began to say well I want one to appear there and appear there and appear there and then he you know as he began to walk he just he just started to walk in that in the spirit and they began to as the Lord began to speak to him and deal with him then he just kept moving forward and he said well this I want one here because this place you know you don't see squirrels over here like this I almost wanted to be there you know as he began to deal with that then he all of a sudden and then you know he had he shot what two of them then all of a sudden the Lord said I thought you said you wanted three so the Lord brought him back to that and he's like oh yeah that's right you did I did say three but God gave him those three but you know what he didn't he didn't try to figure out what was taking place just like when he was sitting there and he was talking to all those Brothers he said you know we don't try to figure out how Abraham got the RAM on the mountain when he wanted to slay Isaac when he was right there he said all of a sudden all we know is that he's Jehovah Jireh that's all we know and all of a sudden when he came to that place that had faith in God then he realized the lamb was there the ram was there for the sacrifice and when when sister had heard those and brother Byron began to speak on that just simple childlike faith and when she heard that he said that's nothing but the truth that she rose up in faith to hey that's for me I can see that nothing but the truth and now God honored her faith some poor literate woman but you know what God spoke and told the prophet give her what she had whatever she desires whatever you speak sister had as you said it whatever you speak you can have it's it like he said he said if you ask for a million dollars or whatever it is he said see if God doesn't come down and do it right now but you're so amazing because of all the things that sister Hattie could ask for a million dollars her sister is healing all the things that she could ask for in this world and the only thing that was more precious than anything in this whole wide world the only thing she wanted was the salvation of her sons why because God knew what she would ask for and that's right when he put it before he knew what she had asked for it and when she said I want the salvation of my children then you know what you can have it in the name of the Lord it belongs to you because you've asked what's the same thing when you come here what what have you he said whatever you ask when you desire whatever you desire When you pray he said believe and you shall have it but the question is is what do you believe what do you have faith to believe what do you what do you have need of what are you do whatever is it that you desire when you come to the house of God what is it that you have that you're Desiring tonight what is it that you stand here not and say well God is the same that he ever was will have ever if he's ever done anything in in the in the scripture we've ever seen God do anything that he's here tonight to do the same thing whether whether it's me or or brother Wade or brother Dale or brother Bob or whoever it is it doesn't really matter who the person is because you're not putting but we we can all gather but we're the representative because we're his hands and his feet here so we're just standing here in his place but we're just following what he said but he's the one that's going to do the work whatever you have need of he's here to meet the need but all you got to do is have faith in what God said you can trust him hey do we believe what God Said this is this is from the message faith is our victory he says he said you say John when he wrote that well 15. first 15 first John just scroll up there first John chapter 5 says whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that beget loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God now continue on there and and faith is our Victory brother REM says so you say John when he wrote that he did not have he did not have my troubles he did not have to deal with the folk I have to deal with he did not have to go through the things that I do that's right he may not had to deal with the same folk he made I had to overcome the same thing but he never excluded them for he said this the faith is the victory that overcomes the world the whole thing he said how is it it's faith in it right above it when you have the written word of God laying before us and the Holy Spirit here performing and showing the resurrection of Jesus Christ with the Divine promises written here that whatsoever thing you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it what do you have to do then have faith not just floating faith not just a make-believe Faith but a real faith I used to continuing oh he says he says now Faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is Faith what is the conquer conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prisons it means that the sin that once ruled you you roll it now it means that you have overcome it he said you've whipped it you're greater than it is he said oh I feel religious right now he said what was first a sin a sinner or a savior he's at a savior for a savior is more powerful than a sin which was first the Healer or sickness it couldn't be a Healer lest it was over the sickness It Is A Healer it could conquer the sickness and faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil faith is the victory he said faith in what not faith in your church not faith in a Creed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it is the victory say my arm's still crampled my faith is the victory I still feel sick but faith is the victory oh it overcomes the world when you can climb into God by prayer until you've seen the thing conquered under you there is nothing that can hurt you you've overcome you've got 50 miles of Elbow Room you're selling free then Elbow Room why because when when you're under that weight and you're under that oppression then all of a sudden when you realize that you can come into God and all of a sudden you realize you've overcome through him whether it's moved or not you've already overcome it he said you've got 50 miles of Elbow Room well because you can feel all the freeness why because everything has moved back why because light has pushed back the darkness why because you've pushed back the powers of Satan so all of a sudden you've got room you've got room you feel like you can breathe and why we've overcome why because you have faith in him because we have faith in him that we've already overcome why because he's overcome that he's overcome and we're standing in him that we're Overcomers we're more than conquerors through him brother I was talking many people talk about having different you know oh I have this problem and I have that problem but if you have but if you have faith in what God said he said so what I still feel sick whatever so what if we're not putting our faith in all these things if we realize what God has done and we put our faith in it so what ever happens we don't be shaken by those things and this is from the message desperation I want to read this he says I I believe that the reason this is 24. the quote 24. he said I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love God the love of God I think that the love of God calls us desperation if God is in you the token inside of you and you see the conditions of times and people waiting in sin the way they are it'll throw you into desperation I believe it will he said now the word plain that states if you want to put this down Galatians 5 6 says that Faith worketh by love see Faith worketh by love and the only way that you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is Love's incentive incentive that exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love now now you if you don't have love you can't have faith see he said how can you have faith and if you how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's in philio now how about in Agape to God how can it be if you don't love God he said if you loved your wife and never tell her about it and never sat down to make love to her expressed it to her kiss her hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know and how pretty she is and how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it he said that's the way we do to God if we love him tell him about it we sit down and we adore him and we worship him see love drives us to that and he's talking about if you're if your wife was sick you know you'd throw you into desperation if she had some kind of disease and he said that's the same way it the way it is we must have love before we can have faith and Faith when we have genuine love what does it do it pushes our faith out on the Battlefront for God see genuine Godly love for God and for his word and for his people will push Faith out there love just takes a hold of faith and says come on let's go and it goes and cause that's what love does John 14 23 says Jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep my words now you can't keep his words without having faith in what he said see so you see if you if he loves God then he keeps God's word if he said I'm the Lord that healeth thee he believes that love makes him believe it because the love dominates all though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not love it's nothing see though I have faith to move mountains and not have love it's nothing love dominates all because God is love a love of a god of love now yes sir see Jesus said if a man loves me he will keep my words so if we have faith in God and to have have the love of God to love God and if we love God as you said then have faith and say and it should throw us into desperation Lord make Lord make us desperate if that's what it takes one because if we have the love of God then we see the world and the condition that things are in it should put us in a in a state of desperation but if but many times we've seen people you know they just they go along it's the same old same old and they never it never changes but you know it should throw us into desperation when we see the condition that the world is in it it should it should drive us to that and he said if you have the love of God in you and you have faith in God's word he said then it pushes your faith out on the Battlefront then what is it wherever the wherever the the the attack of the devil is or whatever taking place that it pushes you to have faith and go out there well because God doesn't have cowards it's going to push you out there but because you know if you if God if the Devil comes in and you're a Son of God and you and you know your place or you're a daughter of God and you know your place then you know what something's got to be inside of you to raise up to go against that well because he said when the Devil comes in like a flood when the enemy comes in he said he'll raise up a standard well you know many times people they think the problem is well we're just going to take a step back no God's working through you he's expecting you how many times did Brother around stand there and he was talking about having the prayer line and different people being sick and and the different things and he was standing there waiting on well God what are you going to do and God told Brother Brown I said well what are you going to do about it he said because you've got to have something to do with it because God will honor what you do what you say God honors your faith it's something that you've got to do not just wait on God well I'm just waiting to know you've got to take the got to move you got to take it one by what he says and claim it confess it 'll push you out on the onto the Battle Front God doesn't have cowards if we if we stand there and have needs and you know what and we don't ask God for what we have need of whatever it is if we don't claim it and believe that it's going to take place then you know what that we're dishonoring God that's a that's a that's a disrespect to God because you know what if he died on the cross of Calvary if he took those stripes on his back for your healing and he then he died on the cross for our justification that if we don't walk in exactly all of that you know what because you know what Hayden Hayden what an Indian giver when he died and it took those stripes on his back for our healing and he said I am the god to healeth all your diseases and all your iniquities are healed then you know what if we carry those diseases with us and have not put it under the blood and claiming our healing and walking in that then you know what that we dishonor what God Said because you know if if God if somebody gives you something and you don't take it well you know it's just like when somebody needs something and you've got it there before them and you're holding it out to them and saying listen this is what you have need of just like when he was talking about the man sitting on the doorstep of the doctor and the doctor trying to help him and giving him medicine and telling this is what you got to do to get better and the man dies on the doorstep why because he's right there and he sees the doctor face to face and here's what the doctor tells him and he gives him the exact the the prescription of what he has to do but he does but he fails to do it and it's the same way if you have a need then you know what if you've not put it if you've not handed over to God if you've not claimed what you have need of if you've not claimed your Victory then tonight is the night to do that you know if the devil's jumped on your back and he's hey whatever he's done then you know what you know what just stand up and say you know I claim I claim my Deliverance I claim my healing I claim my blessings in Jesus Christ's name whatever it is that you have need of you just claim it why because he's made the way I don't know I don't know how he's going to work these things out I've got money problems or whatever it is but you know what when God speaks to your situation he begins to speak then you know what you claim it Lord I don't know how you're going to work it out but you know I know you're going to work it out now I can just take my hands off of it but I'm gonna give it over to you I I tell them about brother JT's Church you know you know when I'm going to preach on I preached on Levi up there but you know I was talking about when Levi was little you know it didn't matter what it was you know he he told everybody daddy was a fixer I worked in maintenance but you know I was a fixer and it didn't matter what it was I he I could fix it you know he just gave it to Harry here Dad it's like you know Plastics broke somehow I'm supposed to weld it back together or whatever you know he didn't care he's like Dad it's yours here you're going to work you got miracles you just work them well sometimes you know what there's no Miracles that you can work you know it's it's it's beyond all hope now it's time for the garbage can it's easier it's like let's buy you another one because that one's gone they're not but you know the thing about God is there's no there's no such thing as hopeless there's there's no such thing as no hope and and you know you know well it's got you know I you know God's a god of Miracles when it when it gets to the place where it looks impossible when you don't see a way out that's when God Specializes that's when God comes on the scene and that's what he wants you and I to do put our faith in him and spell wait on him to come and because you know like lots of times just like the Hebrew the the children of the Hebrew children you know when they went into the fire you know they didn't know how they were going to get out or if they were going to get out but you know what they had faith in God wait we're not going to Bow we're not going to we're not going to follow that and if we have to go into fire we just go in the fire because our God's more than able to deliver us we don't know if he don't but you know what we're still got a testimony that we're not giving up and we're not bowing and because of their because of their faith in God because of what their testimony was God didn't send somebody he couldn't send an angel or anything they say no I got to go down there myself he was in the midst of the fire with him when you when you ever looks impossible you just look for God because he'll be there amen God bless you tonight let's all stand how the musicians come [Applause] you know the let's see got any rivers you think are impossible got any mountains you can't tunnel through I don't know where that should be in the spiral book I think God Specializes in things thought impossible I'm not sure what what key that's in but but he'll do for you what no power know what anybody else can do but he'll do it but
