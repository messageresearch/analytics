[26:54] where we've been reading Matthew 24 and we'll started reading about 23 22 23 to
[27:02] read this if we had any bring out a little early if we can we'll try to get
[27:06] to see if they can be any questions anybody Woodhouse oh you know we could
[27:13] try to cover that a little bit and we'll just call it questions and answers and
[27:16] what I've done now I ran off a good many copies this morning of basically all of
[27:25] the quotes that I've been using from the prophets so Terrence is passing them out
[27:30] if you want one just get one like to each family and then that way we can you
[27:35] know we can go back if there's any extra we'll have them to do with it but that's
[27:40] you know at a real good time yesterday with the the youth that we the lifetime
[27:46] see we didn't get to come we came a little bit late so we didn't get to see
[27:49] the events and the things and we enjoyed it it was real good brother Nathaniel
[27:55] done a good job ministering given little testimony and looking forward this
[27:59] afternoon to him ministering for us and this afternoon we'll be the youth time
[28:06] so they will be taking the services and doing the things in heaven and all like
[28:11] that so remember that remember the evening service rather than insane you
[28:14] know remember the fellowship meeting will be
[28:16] here on the third Saturday and brother what's his name what errand McGarrity
[28:24] I'm going to write that down somewhere McGary where I can remember it all right
[28:30] and that'll be the word that we can know that okay also Oh Wade will be
[28:36] ministering Lord within wins the try to get him back into the line and
[28:41] getting things to going in the Lord okay any other announcements 15th of February
[28:57] will be our Valentine's band for quit for the couples of the church so
[29:02] remember that you know we'll try to get everything together and all do it okay
[29:06] all right father we thank you for this day and your grace we thank you for your
[29:11] love and your understanding of us thank you for you and we just ask you Lord to
[29:16] help us to understand what the hour that we're living what a wonderful
[29:22] opportunity to be able to enjoy the presence of your revealing of your word
[29:28] unto us we pray that you would just have your way open their eyes of
[29:34] understanding close our hearts to things that are not needful and what the rest
[29:41] of the world does the rest everybody does that's their business help us to
[29:45] just settling in to where we can be have a personal revelation in a association
[29:52] with you Lord through the opening of your word forgive our sins cleanse us of
[29:57] all unrighteousness and got us in dial up in Jesus name Amen
[30:04] Matthew 24 verse 23 you remember how we brought this out all the other is back
[30:16] prior to this time coming down from from the building of the mosque of Omar and
[30:21] on down to the Titus and and sent in now coming down to our time our time here
[30:27] then If any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ there I believe it not
[30:33] for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great
[30:39] signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they say all deceive the
[30:45] very elect now we know brother Branham said frankly get to elect
[30:49] tied-up you'd have to cut it short right now just remember one thing if
[30:57] this day of the anointed ones and the things that we've been talking about is
[31:03] the deceiving part remember one thing the bride can't be deceived all right
[31:11] but you know what that means everybody else is is that sensible if it's almost
[31:19] gets the elect then everything else is deceived you know so then ething
[31:26] anything outside of this message is deceived all right now because the only
[31:33] way we can know about the message of the prophet or the God bringing it to us
[31:37] okay now that's sensible enough behold I have told you before wherefore if they
[31:44] shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth go not forth behold
[31:52] he is in the secret chambers believe it not no don't follow every little
[31:57] doctrine of whim whims and ideas and thing where is the lightning shyness
[32:02] Lightning cometh out of the east and shyness even unto the West so shall also
[32:07] the coming of the Son of man be now our concern we haven't dealt into this part
[32:13] we'll go back to it but you see there is to be the coming of
[32:18] the Son of Man that's the main part is the coming of the Son of Man all right
[32:24] now there's that's the thing we had this last night in the questions and answers
[32:30] in the Bible study and the questions ended up which I hope we'll get to the
[32:34] in it how do we know well we're only going to know by the revealing of the
[32:40] Son of man the only way we're gonna know the truth is by the revealing of the son
[32:46] of man all right now that'll that'll staying on for wheresoever the carcass
[32:51] is the word there will the eagle's be gathered to get it you may be seated the
[32:57] Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word
[33:07] what I'll stick that in my Bible yeah I put a great big one right there okay all
[33:17] right like I said we last night we have questions and answers you know if any of
[33:23] you are interested in any time coming and we don't have no set line to go by
[33:30] we just come and ever who has a question we lay the question out and we try to
[33:36] discuss that question as to what you know they're doing all right we got
[33:41] started last night and we had one question and we finished two hours
[33:46] talking on that one question because it wound up being exactly what we're
[33:52] talking about here and I told you last night I said I will speak in the morning
[33:57] about these things because this is message number six that we've been
[34:02] talking on the anointed ones all right I believe that we're in the last days I
[34:10] believe the Prophet brought the message and What did he say
[34:13] the only wants the endtime thank God for the opening of the seals now if you'll
[34:20] take my word and go do it look over at the beginning I'll give you the page in
[34:25] a minute but you go over to the end of the book read about the last 20 pages of
[34:30] anointed ones it's right down where we're living
[34:34] all right right to the point to where we're living right now because that's
[34:40] the way it's supposed to be all right but talking about those things we were
[34:44] discussing you know the anointed ones and that's the one thing I want you to
[34:50] think about there is not but one Christ there's just one god there's one Christ
[35:01] one Lord one faith one baptism now he anoints many yes because we're in the
[35:09] last days when it was promised that he'd pour out his spirit upon all flesh
[35:15] right now we covered those things to show you that's right down here
[35:20] Azusa Street was a fulfillment I've been pouring out of his spirit upon all flesh
[35:26] but that just keeps going now it's going on now because he's pouring out that
[35:31] spirit upon all flesh now all right and in doing that see then there can't be
[35:40] many Christ so we're gonna have to take the one thing and I believe that's the
[35:44] one point that that most people are missing on the message of noted ones we
[35:51] want to have an anointing over here an anointing over here you know we want to
[35:58] have one for the bride and one for the rest of the world
[36:03] well that's no such thing I want you to show me where the Prophet says that I
[36:08] want you to show me and cry in anything where he said it's the same anointing
[36:12] that's the mystery the mystery is if the anointing is the same yeah but see
[36:22] that's what what we say we think this is an anointing of the Holy Ghost come over
[36:26] here for different anointing of the devil no no no and we'll go through this
[36:32] in a little bit and just read some of it to show you brother Branham says the
[36:36] same anointing that was on Moses was on Balaam ain't no difference then but you
[36:49] see the same anointing that you have right now is the same anointing that was
[36:56] back very to walk the shores of Galilee or else you got another anointing just
[37:03] trying to make some simple statements for our understanding you say do we need
[37:08] to understand this brother branham said in the anointed ones the end time that
[37:13] we would be able to understand whether or not that we are a cuckoo bird you
[37:19] know our excuse me he uses the word Brier or a thistle or whatever and this
[37:26] only came out at the opening the well let me just get to that point and
[37:30] we'll just read it okay they let it be that away go ahead and pull up number
[37:35] one brothers must let's get started on just a little bit I'll try to just run
[37:40] through some of these and run them off real quick if I can but I ask you to
[37:46] please read anointed wants to end time and brother Branham in the naughty ones
[37:53] the end time said a good message to study would be the god of this evil age
[37:59] all right now he said that that it would be good to study that part of it because
[38:04] that's where he was covering him alright you go from from about the anointed ones
[38:11] being in 65 at the beginning 725 you know beginning and from then on he's
[38:18] talking about anointed ones until his crucifixion he talking about anointed
[38:24] ones and just about every message go back and study at the sea yeah I try to
[38:28] give you something to make you interested in your own self of reading
[38:36] it's not that the pastor has this or the preacher has the issue or the preachers
[38:41] are supposed to feed us no no you're supposed to have your own experience now
[38:48] the question was last night how do we know whether we were anointed wondering
[38:54] brother branham tells us he said it is only by the word well they got the word
[39:03] and they got the word and even you say the Baptist has got the word they only
[39:12] got part Pentecostals got booked only got part it's what I said one Christ one
[39:22] message one Christ see this message is the only one that's got the truth of all
[39:31] there's not one outside of this and that's what tears my heart out to think
[39:35] how these people can turn around in and say brother Branham was so wrong come on
[39:44] the doors of Lula opened for you out on the Internet's they've got your great
[39:49] revelations to come and show us that ain't no challenge that's just a
[39:57] straight fact come and show us we're all but now don't bring little silly things
[40:05] you know don't bring that one gospel says there's two blind men the other
[40:11] gospel says there's one blind man now don't be that narrow-minded if you're
[40:19] gonna come to talk about the word let's talk about the word I'm just serious
[40:23] that's not arrogant or hateful I'm serious it's time to say it it's time to
[40:28] say back to the people out there and let the people have a choice see the
[40:36] anointing that's on the bride is the anointing that's on the kimono can we
[40:41] quote it this way it rain falls on the just and the unjust it's the same rain
[40:48] for the beans of corn the cocoa bears in fact it's the same right behave it one
[40:54] line the able one Christ I don't you don't like my words I ain't but they
[41:01] finally did put that in the dictionary I reckon I quoted it so much too like they
[41:05] put it in in there but not all right now listen seeing all of this accumulation
[41:15] of evidence that now now that we now live in I think it's a good thing to
[41:25] rehearse these things and draw them out since the seals has been opened and find
[41:31] out the truth of these things as God has been so loyal to us with His grace to
[41:37] show us these things now I asked you I said it I asked you
[41:43] go to the lots of lies ten pages of the northern ones the end time and read it
[41:48] real careful it's right down to where we're at now he says the same thing but
[41:55] he brings it down to his message and worse I had no all right thank God for
[42:03] the opening of the seals these things were not understood I'm saying until you
[42:09] listen the Prophet didn't preach anointed ones until after the seals were
[42:13] broke he didn't preach marriage and divorce to life the seals broke there
[42:20] were certain things he didn't preach the life to the seals was broke why cuz
[42:23] that's revealed in the seals everything was revealed in the ceiling why don't we
[42:28] don't want to see you you know what's the trouble alright go to the next one
[42:33] and we'll get these little points out of the way
[42:37] paragraph 70 look what he says the prophecies of Balaam exactly right cuz
[42:42] he couldn't speak nothing else that ties the whole Bible together even Balaam
[42:47] could not say nothing contrary he told Balin I'll go with you you've offered me
[42:54] high for your kingdom you can give me all of it but I can't say nothing that
[43:00] God don't tell me now him you call him a false prophet the that state in his life
[43:11] that he could not speak nothing different listen if we claim to be
[43:15] anything we were to do something now look I hope your feelings don't get hurt
[43:20] and don't turn that off them phones off and don't get up and go out just sit
[43:27] still and let's see if it's the Holy Spirit won't reveal it to us and prove
[43:32] it to us you say brother you say but that just whatever you believe nother
[43:37] way you're saying just whatever you believe he ain't saying that just sit
[43:41] still and listen ask God to open your heart then you'll find out whether
[43:45] you're a briar or a thistle or whatever you're standing wherever you're standing
[43:52] now this message do we need to know how do you gonna know whether you're
[43:59] Breyer at this one or what you are that's what he just said well I know
[44:06] that I'm born again how do you know how do you know you're born again I shouted
[44:16] I cried I swung huh every one of those things Satan can
[44:19] impersonate and you know yourself the Prophet said what I just made this table
[44:23] you can't depend on no fleshly things to be proof you can only go to the evidence
[44:30] of the Holy Ghost and the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[44:35] what whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word that's the only
[44:42] thing we can go to yeah but I know I'm born again praise God I'm not trying to
[44:48] take away your experience I'm trying to tell each one of us we need to have an
[44:52] experience with God if we haven't had it then that's what we need and brother
[44:59] Branham comes over to that he brings that out in the message there and what
[45:05] do we do well I know I'm saved that's like what I said back in when
[45:10] that guy said God was dead boy they just put it in the papers and I know my god
[45:15] live die I talked to him this morning
[45:20] come on how many of them that put out on earth and many denominations put out
[45:26] great statements against that man well how many other one had a new birth why
[45:34] did they turn the message down if they turn to message down it proves they
[45:39] don't have the new birth right so you can holler all you won't do I talked to
[45:45] him you know I doing this that's great statements but all that is you're just
[45:51] running your mouth words are true evidence whether or not the spirit in
[45:59] you agrees plural agrees continues to agree
[46:05] doesn't stop anywhere you know that never done away with brother brother
[46:11] branham never done away with with apples on the tree is proof it's an apple tree
[46:19] right he never done away with any of them things that used to be a people's
[46:25] idea of what the holy ghost was he believed in every one of them he shouted
[46:29] he spoke in tongues he done all of those things but he had one thing to connect
[46:36] it out and he said the angel of the Lord
[46:38] corrected him in a dream told him that's whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[46:45] with the word these didn't there's one thing about it you can't then you ain't
[46:53] gonna change what you you ain't gonna try to change what this man say is no
[47:00] you're gonna take what he says okay listen now getting to the point you say
[47:09] number three someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on those
[47:16] people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine
[47:24] spirit of God upon a person and yet they are false wound down to the bottom and
[47:34] what does he say he says that's dust saith the Lord now you want to argue
[47:39] with it thus saith the Lord
[47:43] so then anointed ones genuine annoy only one Christ so the same anointing has to
[47:55] be it has to be the same on each individual all right the wheat if you
[48:03] got your things go with and just turn over the rough number forward we'll
[48:05] start on here both of wheat and the weeds live by the same anointing from
[48:13] heaven both of them rejoicing over that ought to be sensible same rained it
[48:23] brings up the beans brings up the weeds but you know what it brings up more
[48:28] weeds than it does beans I plant a whole bag of beans get a few and I don't plant
[48:34] them other things they get out there on their own and there's more of them right
[48:40] but you see the point of what I'm getting at
[48:46] reiji's going up to the bottom where we got martins they've really same guard in
[48:52] the same place under the same spouts they're come up weed and they're come up
[48:55] tears by the same thing notice the same anointing water anointing water brings
[49:01] forth the wheat brings forth the weed the same Holy Spirit that anoints the
[49:07] church that gives them a desire to save souls and gives them power to perform
[49:12] miracles it falls on the unjust the same as the just the very same spirit now you
[49:22] can't make it another way and understand Mathew 24:24 and he said there shall
[49:29] arise false Christ's false anointed ones anointed with a genuine thing but the
[49:34] false prophets of its false teachers he said he'd get down to the mark of the
[49:39] beast but listen the same anointing that anoints the church he said is the same
[49:54] anointing that noise although everything else that's only one anointing yeah but
[50:01] we got this anointing over here and and and they got that anointing over there
[50:05] and show me where the Prophet taught that I'll accept it and be glad to tell
[50:09] who told it to me but you can't find it it's the same anointing there's only one
[50:17] Holy Ghost there's only one God there's only one anointing all right so just
[50:25] remember that point there's never been but one anointing
[50:28] all right go ahead to number five yeah we know we're number six Moses a man
[50:41] sent from God with the Word of God and on his journey taken Israel into the
[50:45] Promised Land strictly with the commandment of God he met another
[50:49] prophet another anointed one that had a genuine anointing of the same Holy
[50:58] Spirit that was upon Moses are you going to say that the prophets wrong well I
[51:11] don't believe that then you're saying the prophets wrong guys II sense wake up
[51:19] he's a prophet the Holy Spirit was upon this man his name was Balaam we're all
[51:26] acquainted with him well the very things the same thing the things that the man
[51:30] said is still taking place he spoke in ascender Bible about 2800 years ago
[51:38] they aren't like a unicorn or Israel and as many there's more other things that
[51:43] he doing okay now think about it same anointing go ahead we're still in the
[51:51] north he wants to end huh progress 68 Balaam anointed with the same spirit
[51:56] that was upon Moses what was the difference
[52:01] well Balaam was false now he's gonna tell you what the difference is so what
[52:07] we think the difference is don't mean nothing
[52:10] it's what he says that's the way I follow the Prophet I'm either gonna
[52:15] follow him or I'm gonna get out no because I got enough sense to know I
[52:21] can't stay between you're either in this message or you're out of the message and
[52:28] what we do about the word will determine whether what we got come on by them
[52:35] annoying with the same spirit that was upon Moses what was the difference the
[52:39] teaching of Moses was perfect and watch him the Bible said here in 2nd
[52:44] Peter it was the teaching of Balaam that
[52:48] Israel received that God never did forgive unpardonable sin the teaching is
[52:54] the difference the teaching is the difference the anointing is the same to
[53:06] understand Mathew 24:24 what do you got they go ahead number 7 the vultures of
[53:18] Jesus day was also casting out Devils now I didn't say that he did it okay
[53:26] anointed ones on the old carcass that's a pretty good statement right they were
[53:34] casting out Devils jesus said and remember they had prophets in those days
[53:38] Kath was the high priest prophesy how many knows that calf was prophesied
[53:43] notice the position of the weed in the field it's watered by the same anointing
[53:48] why did the Bible say he prophesied because he was high priest that year a
[53:53] rotten scavenger a weed and a thistle sitting among the wheat but the Spirit
[54:02] was upon him Catholics prophesied and said it was necessary that one died for
[54:08] the sins of the people because he was trying to stop with the insurrection of
[54:13] taking place out in the natural all right so he's saying that it was
[54:17] necessary that one died for the sins of the people he goes on and crucified
[54:22] Jesus Christ did what are we gonna do Church come on but the Spirit was all on
[54:32] him the genuine the Holy Spirit of God the Holy Spirit of God was upon him
[54:38] to preach prophesy for tell it to come and come to Pais and denied and crucify
[54:44] the very vindicated word of the hour
[54:49] then what are we doing
[54:53] hey brother def what are you trying to do I'm trying to prove one time there's
[55:00] not but one anointing there's not an anointing for the genuine and anointing
[55:07] for everything else it's the same anointing if you don't get nothing out
[55:13] of the message study the message bring it and show me that there's a to
[55:17] anointing show me there's two guards water it's the same anointing yeah but I
[55:22] I don't understand you mean you mean that that's the Holy Ghost throwing them
[55:26] out there that your prophet said it was a Holy Ghost from cosmos and confidence
[55:31] is one had Jesus killed you get the anointing of the Holy Ghost was the same
[55:41] he said I don't understand that we are listen if you don't understand something
[55:51] what do you do well I don't know what to do it sounds like this and it sounds
[55:56] like that I don't know what it is we'll find somebody do something that's too
[56:03] late well how do we know cause there's no only does you say in there knowing he
[56:09] would have same anointing well somewhere this thing goes got to be settled right
[56:18] there falling away now by the thousands from the message because that's what the
[56:23] Bible said that they must be a falling away in their falling away but you know
[56:27] what they had to be somewhere to fall so they had to be up in the message going
[56:31] with it running with it now they're falling all right we'll see that's the
[56:36] greatest sign that is the Bible being fulfilled and why are we not then
[56:43] resourcing not because it Dara falling away no not resorting to that but
[56:48] rejoicing that the Word of God is keeping us from falling
[56:55] number one thing keeping me and you from following that's God himself well not
[57:03] use fetters I just can't see how they let that anointing cesano both them do
[57:08] you believe brother Brian was a prophet well why don't you accept what he says
[57:14] when I still see now you're saying he's wrong we know we're gonna put everything
[57:21] we've got onto the Prophet that's where the people this message the biggest
[57:26] percent of you they don't do it they're scared what do you think they're falling
[57:30] away now any little thing comes up and churches
[57:35] just fall away them any of you was around in 1977 when it didn't take place
[57:45] and churches were falling away and sending their books back to
[57:48] Jeffersonville well because it didn't happen according to what they thought
[57:56] well you know what evidently what was thought of back that must been wrong you
[58:04] know how I know it must have been wrong go we're here 2020 so what we thought of
[58:13] back dar was wrong that it's wrong inlets or whatever coming through but
[58:18] listen I'm trying my best to get you to see one thing you can't see anointed
[58:26] ones and if you can't see anointed ones in the correct way you can't see what
[58:32] you are where you're at or whether or not you have the new birth but can you
[58:44] understand it this way the rain falls on the just and the unjust it's the same
[58:54] rain the quickens of wheat that quickens the Browns same identical God doing it
[59:05] yeah but what you mean God for that huh yeah that's
[59:09] what it says in the Bible he said he sent these things among mr. tries to see
[59:12] whether we'd fall brother Brendan said that he would try the bride in the end
[59:16] down to see she'd fall said see what were she wouldn't fall like he fell oh
[59:21] but you can't get people to agree with the word take that one right there Eve
[59:30] brother branham said before Adam could come to Eve she had fallen he said
[59:37] before Jehovah could come to the Old Testament bride she fell he said before
[59:44] the bride could come to Jesus Christ in his fullness
[59:50] they went to Nicaea and failed but I've heard preachers right here they used to
[59:59] preach with me say oh but that wouldn't that wasn't the bride it went and I see
[1:00:04] yeah brother Branham said it was he said the true church wound up it and I see
[1:00:10] yeah we see they didn't believe that they believe the false vine went and I
[1:00:16] said what the false line have to go far if they're false right they aren't ready
[1:00:22] to see but you see that's word that when you stand you're gonna stand alone what
[1:00:27] you believe in you minister brethren you better consider that sometimes you're
[1:00:32] gonna stand by yourself because God's gonna try you to see what you'll do he's
[1:00:40] gonna put it out there in front there to see what you're gonna do and look what
[1:00:43] they're doing that falling right and left like I said to start with if it's
[1:00:51] to the point that it would almost deceive the elect
[1:00:55] everything else is already to see what about it look where we're staying all
[1:01:05] right now let's get something and then we'll pick it up and move over all right
[1:01:13] bring up Luke eight
[1:01:19] all right they're supposed to have these on only it's not it's not in what you
[1:01:26] got no pull up Luke eight a simple little parable one parable told in Luke
[1:01:38] Mark and Matthew a parable let's see what it says he's got Luke Luke eight
[1:01:48] nine go to 11 verse 11 now you know he gave the parable in told what it wasn't
[1:01:57] then they said you know this what is this and he says well this is the
[1:02:02] parable this seed is the word of God all right now started off the seed is the
[1:02:06] word of God we ain't talking about sowing beans and corn everybody thanks
[1:02:10] Boyle ain't it something that brother branham
[1:02:13] told us that when you plant corn you're gonna get colon said we thought when you
[1:02:19] plant corn you gonna get beans you say that's stupid brother Dale that's
[1:02:23] exactly the way people are he didn't have to tell me
[1:02:30] planting corn would get corn the parable is what it's the word now let's see what
[1:02:40] it says what do we do ask him saying once the prayer will be and he said unto
[1:02:49] the imminence given it is given to know you unto you it is given to know the
[1:02:55] mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others and parables that seeing they
[1:02:59] might not see and hearing they might not understand now we good old Baptists we
[1:03:09] thought Jesus spoke in parables to make it simple how much is that in the
[1:03:15] message now how many are you thinking that Jesus procured spoke in parables to
[1:03:20] make it simple he spoke in parables to hide it
[1:03:24] that's what the Bible says to hide it not to make it simple that's what I said
[1:03:31] you plant beans you get beans you don't have to make it no more simple than that
[1:03:39] but he spoke in parables that he might have it the scene you might see in here
[1:03:44] and you might understand understand now the parable is this the seed is the word
[1:03:49] of God those by the wayside are they that hear the Watts now then come with
[1:03:58] the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts unless they should
[1:04:03] believe and be saved the devil comes and takes the word out listen they under a
[1:04:15] car they which when they hear receive the word with joy in these having no
[1:04:21] root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away and they
[1:04:30] would fell upon thorns are they which when they heard go forth and are choked
[1:04:36] with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to
[1:04:41] perfection but that on the good ground are they which in the honest and good
[1:04:48] heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit unto patience simple
[1:04:58] parable Matthew says they understand understand it Matthew says understand a
[1:05:07] thing and mark says receives I'm powerful but listen do you understand
[1:05:17] what he's describing there's two things being described don't have a enough to
[1:05:27] do it with two identical so we'll do that these two things being described
[1:05:34] all right both of them is talking about the sowing
[1:05:38] of the seed it's the same seed that falls into the ground and withers away
[1:05:49] because there's no nothing there to quicken it all right
[1:05:54] the same seed is the seed that's in the thorns and tongues
[1:06:00] that's people at what hears the word and because they don't want to the cares of
[1:06:08] life and things and all come in and take over right and what do you turn down the
[1:06:14] word come on what do you turn down the word but the
[1:06:27] lysed is what the word that's in sown into the heart and it's quickened or
[1:06:34] made alive you understand what I'm getting both of these assignment
[1:06:44] what's the difference what happened in that parable the word was planted you
[1:06:52] agree you want to reread it you don't read Matthew you want to read mark you
[1:06:56] want to say that the word was planted that's my point each one of the three
[1:07:00] Gospels declares the word was planted why did it not mature what went wrong
[1:07:11] come on this was I was thinking about it last night when Nathaniel was talking
[1:07:16] about Cindy what was that when you said everybody preach it on David and and
[1:07:20] there were you know a new preacher to come you know what new preachers in the
[1:07:23] Baptist I'll preach the seed the word the parables that's what the priests
[1:07:31] come on the parables telling you what
[1:07:38] I'm seed everything's fine with it no problems what went wrong was when you
[1:07:45] don't water the seed and are by it'll die and go away goes into the ground it
[1:07:52] does this it don't work right but what's the difference in the anointing upon the
[1:07:58] genuine and the false the order remember one time they're not false into you
[1:08:06] turning down the world if you don't get that point then drop it and forget it
[1:08:11] Balaam Balaam was a prophet you listen to brother Branham he said Balaam was a
[1:08:17] prophet he said to be a prophet in Israel is a wonderful thing you realize
[1:08:23] they depended on Balaam as being their profit until Elijah stood up Balaam was
[1:08:29] not a false prophet until Elijah come up then when in Balaam had to go against
[1:08:37] Elijah he proved then if there's something wrong he wanted to riches he
[1:08:41] wanted two things and he finally got him
[1:08:46] the parable the sowing of the seed goes into the ground some of it you know what
[1:09:02] we're talking about some of us in stony it don't do no good
[1:09:04] some of us in this that don't do no what's the problem they were not wrong
[1:09:09] with the word there was nothing wrong with the seed it's what took place to
[1:09:16] the seed after it was planted it's the same anointing same rain that raised up
[1:09:23] the wheat raised up the beans raised up the corn raised up the weeds it's the
[1:09:28] same seed because you're not talking about but one seed what happened the
[1:09:37] Holy Spirit comes down to quicken then
[1:09:43] what was the difference in Peter them and con us and then when Caiaphas with
[1:09:48] all of his paperwork could rolled it out of them how long and tell them how great
[1:09:52] what had stuck with the word and how everything was right Nicodemus even goes
[1:09:59] to the Lord Jesus has said we know that thou art a man sent from God we know no
[1:10:06] man can do these things let's go to me with him but what happened to him his
[1:10:14] statement was good he had a good confession but when it was put on the
[1:10:19] line he backed off and said I don't understand I gotta go back to my mama
[1:10:30] and be born again me understand what I'm trying to get you to look at same rain
[1:10:43] same seed different conditions the different conditions is what made the
[1:10:49] problem it took a true seed that was put in the
[1:10:54] ground and the cares of life and things killed that seed out took the life away
[1:11:00] from it all right when the Holy Ghost fell what could it do that seed rotting
[1:11:07] in the ground when the rain fell how could it quicken it if it was in thorns
[1:11:13] and the cares of life and these things happen how could it quicken it the seed
[1:11:20] is right the rain is right what went wrong judas iscariot brother branham
[1:11:30] said was anointed it's in the only one then he said he was anointed he kept
[1:11:35] that devil heal the sick the whole kind of thing Judas was all right till he
[1:11:43] faced Jesus at the finish at the finish of the day he showed if color the finish
[1:11:50] of the day he went after the richest in different things right what happened to
[1:11:56] all that word that he had planted in him all in here he wound up thinking it's no
[1:12:01] good you know what it went being no good for him but you know what
[1:12:10] Peter heard the same word Judas did James heard the same word to Judas then
[1:12:19] some of them took the word and held it and some of them took the word and
[1:12:24] turned it down when they turned down that word in non seed the church age
[1:12:31] book says in none seed there's nothing to quicken what is none seed what is
[1:12:40] done seed we're supposed to be farmers or what is non seed hybrid seed it'll
[1:12:49] produce one time that's it it has nothing to carry it on non seed means
[1:12:56] hybrid high breeding in this message is what adding anything or in the Bible to
[1:13:02] coming down through adding any thoughts whatsoever to that Bible it'll take away
[1:13:06] the true meaning of that word all right when the Holy Ghost Falls
[1:13:12] what can you follow him you understand one took the word and hailed it they
[1:13:22] cherished it they couldn't understand that even said we don't understand what
[1:13:28] says thou hast the words of eternal life
[1:13:33] they went to the upper room the Holy Ghost failed and quickened him Judas
[1:13:41] didn't make it to that upper room experience of that and now he was in the
[1:13:44] upper room where the water the the supper was at but he wasn't at the upper
[1:13:49] room when it comes with a holiday and like I said last night and I keep saying
[1:13:55] it over and over you don't think the Bible said Jesus was seen of over 500
[1:14:04] brethren after his resurrection the brother Aaron I mean you would be there
[1:14:13] and you would see him raised and you'd know it with him and you you could
[1:14:20] talent and not you were just with the rest of them and you knew it and he says
[1:14:25] now you go to the Upper Room away well something went wrong with three hundred
[1:14:30] and eighty people that had seen the little boy if I could just see the Lord
[1:14:34] race I'd be alright you're a line through your teeth you
[1:14:37] don't even understand any what you see is what you believe it's what you can
[1:14:43] hold on to is your own belief not what you see you can see a lot of things
[1:14:47] Satan can impersonate anything that God has but he can't be the Holy Ghost why
[1:14:53] did that 380 not make it to the upper room and I'm as human as can be
[1:14:58] I'd have never said they were all lost because it calls them brethren they
[1:15:04] could have come on later and got the Holy Ghost I'm not saying they didn't
[1:15:08] well then they're saying why didn't they make it to the upper room they didn't
[1:15:14] count it worthy they didn't count it to be anything that he was telling them was
[1:15:18] going to take place evidently and they never made it
[1:15:22] whose fault was it they had to seed
[1:15:30] right they heard the word but then when it come to the point of having to go do
[1:15:38] something they walked away what about it
[1:15:48] you mean you could hear the word you mean you can hear the word and turn and
[1:15:55] walk away I pray to you I should be open to the day that we're in you ought to be
[1:16:03] able to say amen to that because you see it happening right among the people of
[1:16:07] the message they're just walking away now what is it don't tell me it's like
[1:16:14] I've always told you eyeing against no brother night against none of them but
[1:16:18] you tell me that a brother could preaching this message for twenty or
[1:16:21] thirty years and he priests great things but when he walked away from the message
[1:16:29] what happened first his wife could or her now the Bible says
[1:16:33] not to do that you don't have to have a prophet to tell you not to cut your hair
[1:16:37] the Bible says don't do it and went right back the life was now I'm
[1:16:42] saying they could have chopped it on put life they'd seen the guy with a beer in
[1:16:46] his hand they're sending me a thing to wear that I can hear it they got a thing
[1:16:52] going now there's a man in I won't try to quote that part closer I'll get to
[1:16:58] the thing but today's a man got over 20,000 in her church he's saying that
[1:17:04] he's come to take her place of brother Brandon you want a little more now this
[1:17:14] is what was told me so I haven't viewed if they take a great Catholic archbishop
[1:17:26] got up and announced the man has to be the one that would take brother
[1:17:30] branham's play mm-hmm come on now hey how close is that this
[1:17:40] Catholic gets out and says this man is I get the tape we'll try to pass it around
[1:17:47] look at it I'm just saying what would set them that close to be sent to me I
[1:17:50] don't really care but for your benefit
[1:17:57] see how can you preach all the life that you preached for 30 40 years and then
[1:18:03] turn around and turn against it
[1:18:09] do you realize though that that anointing is still on those people you
[1:18:15] know those people that are turning against the message the anointing is on
[1:18:19] them I tried to explain that didn't finish the class not I probably
[1:18:26] shouldn't even say something about it but I mentioned it and dropped it
[1:18:31] brother mote years ago told me something that it took a long time to get it down
[1:18:36] into me that I could understand he said brother Dale there's no difference
[1:18:39] between free love and legalism I said brother
[1:18:46] I can't see that because legalism goes that away free love goes that way you
[1:18:58] keep going into legalism you wind up in free love
[1:19:02] because in legalism you're trying your best to appease an angry god legalistic
[1:19:08] ideas and thoughts you're trying to do it and you're saying I know I'm saved
[1:19:12] because I done this I spoke in tongues I cried I was there when God gave me this
[1:19:17] whole ego I know it I see somebody going into free love what do they do they
[1:19:25] don't condemn me to do that sure they gonna think I need to be condemned
[1:19:30] wedding my brother runs that ain't snake thing got no helps right do you
[1:19:38] understand what I'm saying look what's happening if you don't see it without
[1:19:42] one illustration when that brother set up there denounced brother branham's
[1:19:46] message and the first thing that happened his wife started cutting her
[1:19:51] now that's known that ain't just talking about it
[1:19:56] well you tell me that wouldn't okay let's go
[1:20:06] but you can be anointed with the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of
[1:20:17] your life and be lost
[1:20:25] like I told him lies not back in the seventies when these things was coming
[1:20:30] out I will remember him we had ministers meetings on to the cloud out in Arizona
[1:20:37] whether it was right or what is wrong what the dates was that was in the 70s
[1:20:42] we had ministers meetings on these things we had ministers meetings on this
[1:20:46] right here because we didn't have all the abilities to search the message to
[1:20:50] be able to give quotes and I remember they get up and they say you could say
[1:20:56] but brother that that can't be that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:00] every day your life and die and go to hell
[1:21:01] because you can't do it you can't take the Holy Ghost to hell you can't put it
[1:21:07] in hell you can't do it so then there was no way to answer satisfactory until
[1:21:17] finally somebody come up and found I believe us and North it not where
[1:21:22] brother Brennan said you are knowing it on your spirit he said you can be
[1:21:29] anointed on your spirit by the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost now you got
[1:21:37] the right answer it's on your spirit it's where the anointing comes no the
[1:21:44] Holy Ghost came into my soul
[1:21:48] That's all right. There's a genuine there's Peter. But did the--now here's the Word.
[1:22:01] you know, this represents the Word. Peter took that Word in and held it or
[1:22:07] it held him, it's a better way of saying it. Alright, when the Holy Ghost fell what happened?
[1:22:15] Peter was justified and sanctified. Which means he was cleansed and set in order
[1:22:24] for service and everything was perfectly right. The Word had done the cleansing.
[1:22:28] The Word had done it; "Sanctify them through thy Truth cause thy Word is Truth. Is
[1:22:33] that Jesus? St. John 17. Peter and them--the Word had cleaned them.
[1:22:41] Like brother Branham said about David. He said "Look at David what he had." He said "But all he
[1:22:45] needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost." What did Peter and them need then? There they
[1:22:51] were with a clean vessel full of Word. they didn't understand everything, they
[1:22:55] said they didn't. Jesus kept telling them when the Holy Ghost comes I'm gonna
[1:22:59] send it in my Name. It'll come; it'll quicken to you what to do, and don't worry
[1:23:02] about it. Go on! And when the Holy Ghost fell it made that Word alive. There's your
[1:23:09] new birth. You say what happened to this guy? We're gonna change out and just use
[1:23:15] the one okay. But that's the two guys. What happened? Peter and them got the Word
[1:23:23] and the Holy Ghost quickened it. You agree with that now? You go that way? What
[1:23:28] about the others? The cares of life. Are you watching? The things of the world.
[1:23:44] What happened? Satan entered in and brought back into
[1:23:51] the man the 7 times worse. Right? So after it was all finished,
[1:24:02] what are you going to quicken? There's nothing there. There was nothing in Judas
[1:24:11] to quicken. It had been taken out. It was there. It was there. It was there in both
[1:24:28] of them. But the cares of life and the things took it out. Took out what? The
[1:24:35] Word. Or you listen to somebody interpret false Word
[1:24:45] and it took out that Word. And when you do what could you quicken? There's
[1:24:51] nothing in the vessel to quicken. The anointing can strike but it can't go in
[1:24:59] and do anything. It can't quicken a Trinity. Oh I tell you what, now that that
[1:25:04] Trinity when it was revealed to me you ever heard people say that I've heard
[1:25:09] people in this message say that they say well more that that - so that - lords
[1:25:16] then thanks man they when that was revealed to me I was waiting on that -
[1:25:23] soul doctrine to come out I've heard that statement made I said how in the
[1:25:28] world could be waiting on something that ain't true because they can't be - Lords
[1:25:35] they can't be two souls the to soul doctrine was what God give you a soul
[1:25:42] Satan give you so I challenge that on the basis of God's Word and the prophets
[1:25:46] message show me where Satan could ever give you anything other than piss
[1:25:50] twisting turning he can't give you he can't create what you see when I Holy
[1:26:01] Ghost fell I shouted I cried I've done everything you know I know now last week
[1:26:07] I had a little problem now we're not done something wrong but I feel like I'm
[1:26:11] saved I don't think I spend enough to be lost see what are you doing
[1:26:17] you're propping up yourself right well I'll tell you what that's what I was
[1:26:26] trying to get across life's on this boat and tried to get you to cross lies not
[1:26:33] you are a body spirit and soul it doesn't matter what you do about the
[1:26:37] names of these things make sure you keep them in three line one line being a body
[1:26:43] the next line being you can call it spirit or slowly the one it doesn't
[1:26:47] matter to me but make sure you give it memory reason conscious affections then
[1:26:52] the center man you give that either faith or doubt now you're writing 50 60
[1:26:57] and on when the Prophet ended it all up he didn't have to go and
[1:27:02] preach a long sermon about how in his early ministry he said body so spirit
[1:27:08] then in the Ministry of 65 write in 64 he's taught body spirit and soul but see
[1:27:17] if he hadn't told it that way the Bible would have been incorrect because the
[1:27:20] Bible said it divides the difference and he said because of the open of these
[1:27:25] things we can understand do you realize what I'm getting that do
[1:27:31] you realize that this person out here you don't mount to a sign that's your
[1:27:39] body all he's doing is just something you living in well my body let's see
[1:27:44] your body can't lust now I'm quoting I'll give you this one in here where
[1:27:48] brother Ron said you don't even thank with your body he said you think with
[1:27:52] your spirit as a man thinketh in his heart not in his thumping gizzard North
[1:27:59] natural heart in order to brain it's not it's that spirit in you that motivates
[1:28:04] you to make you to think right that's the difference you and a dog but see I'm
[1:28:11] asking you a question
[1:28:16] they said brother Branham said to Christians sin he said yes did brother
[1:28:25] Branham said do you you know how to listen ones huh do you back sighs he
[1:28:29] said everyday well I don't know whether I don't know I'm so confused with with
[1:28:39] with whether it's older spirit or whatever I'm confused well just get out
[1:28:43] the confusion and gets it line up number one you got five senses of the body
[1:28:49] number two you got five senses of the second room number three you got one
[1:28:53] sense faith or doubt let's do it the other way and handle it and forget it
[1:28:59] because I'm asking you a simple question how does a Christian sin when the Bible
[1:29:05] said he that sinneth is lost dead
[1:29:12] we get the Prophet said you seen every day come on church we taught this in the
[1:29:21] Baptist Church you don't like me because of that but I remember in the Baptist
[1:29:25] Church where we was taken we said well what it is is it if we're not really
[1:29:30] this we're not really going out and Atlantis Lee sin
[1:29:33] I wish brother dick was here he'd explain it to you better not can we're
[1:29:36] not going out that landis Lee sin we just do little bitty times well
[1:29:40] according to my Bible ain't no big thing ain't ain't no little sin they sin why
[1:29:47] would the Prophet say you sin if you send in your throw your love if you sin
[1:29:56] in that sin or realm whatever you want to call it you're lost
[1:30:00] but if you've seen in that spirit realm of reading the memory console design
[1:30:09] then you're not lost your soul will correct you and bring you back into line
[1:30:15] then bringing it to you to show that you're wrong that's what I've tried to
[1:30:23] explain 40 years it don't bother you it don't bother you for your prophet to say
[1:30:34] that you see them every day well brother Brandon word I said what hope do I have
[1:30:41] and I quote it wrong last night let her run said that Jesus was tempted of women
[1:30:47] I've caught it in the lustful part and corrected it down there but I'm making
[1:30:51] sure if anybody hears that or anything they tell know what I'm saying but a
[1:30:55] renin said Jesus was tempted
[1:30:59] where was he tempted my Bible says you can't tempt God so it had to be in
[1:31:07] Jesus's spirit realm not as so because your body can't sin well I just wish I'd
[1:31:18] get this over I don't worry about that old body that's why you don't understand
[1:31:24] the way I preach i dont preach quit this quit that do
[1:31:28] this and do that and it makes you saved I've never taught nothing like that and
[1:31:33] never will code it's not scriptural if when you let God take out these things
[1:31:41] you let him come in and take away the need the desires the things in you let
[1:31:48] him do it because you can't quit it you get rid of the Dagmar's another one
[1:31:55] quick as you get that demon out in another one coming back trying to
[1:32:00] condemn you going all right do we believe the Prophet he said we see
[1:32:08] in every day so where do you sin well we don't need to know cuz we're not
[1:32:14] probably garbage-can to you and you're thinking cause that's exactly what
[1:32:20] you're doing you're taking out things that could be quickened you're letting
[1:32:27] those things we've taken out of you by some demon and when you wind up you wind
[1:32:32] up with an empty vessel trying to say it's fool oh I know my vessel is empty
[1:32:36] because I remember when I was clean amen but that ain't all of it you got to put
[1:32:45] nothing in put the word in and let it take it out sanctification and not you
[1:32:53] quit smoke smoking drinking gambling off that's not sanctification that's what we
[1:32:59] teach is sanctification sanctification is the unclean spirit going out of you
[1:33:05] that's what Jesus taught sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit can I
[1:33:13] quote it that away but it runs the justification of work of the older
[1:33:16] spirit sanctification is work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism hears the
[1:33:19] Holy Spirit that's why you can be justified sanctifying you still lost
[1:33:36] the anointing is no different in a bride person that becomes a bride
[1:33:46] birth center it's lost the anointing comes across to try to quicken what you
[1:33:51] got that's the purpose of the anointing what's the rain for little rains for
[1:33:59] making mud holes in my yard don't lie oh that's about as good as we can go
[1:34:05] what is the rain farm to make whatever you have planted come forth alive and
[1:34:14] that's exactly what the preaching of the word does it does that brother Branham
[1:34:19] said preachers what do you do he said a preacher does only one thing he said he
[1:34:24] breaks the spell that Satan has over the people's eyes to work God can speak
[1:34:30] straight to the people now you need that quote that's identical a preacher all I
[1:34:36] do is have a gift they'll be able to do one or the other I can stand right here
[1:34:41] and make you mad as a Hornet or I can stand right here and make you shout but
[1:34:50] I can take my gift and sell ice cream to an Eskimo no you don't understand gifts
[1:35:03] gifts are eternal now I'm talking about 500 minutes per gift
[1:35:07] now gifts are like speaking in tongues out that's in the body across five full
[1:35:11] ministry the gifts you know that brother Branham said the báb to use well let's
[1:35:17] go come on what time we'll go all right then it's a church or church and what
[1:35:23] you want come on I'm trying to find you okay
[1:35:26] the order number eight let's read Feist
[1:35:32] I got the baptism so you saying that I got the baptism with the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:35:38] going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir
[1:35:46] you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still
[1:35:51] be lost and go to hell the Bible says so
[1:35:58] so now worse the baptism of the Holy Ghost do what does it do it strikes that
[1:36:03] second dream I've tried to explain it you've done this out here justification
[1:36:11] sanctification cleanse the vessel and you took the word and you held it and
[1:36:15] when you hold it then the Holy Ghost can come in quick it what you got in there
[1:36:21] but you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you know what I'm saying we'll
[1:36:26] get to it in a minute he said that's on your spirit go ahead
[1:36:33] to the next one still be lost if the baptism on your spirit it's not coming
[1:36:42] into your soul it quickens what you got in your soul then that way it can
[1:36:51] quicken two souls two lords all these doctrines in the message it can't
[1:36:55] quicken the Trinity you can't do those things cause it's not part of the word
[1:37:00] come on trying to do God a service out his will
[1:37:04] now notice in this now David thought he had everything in order
[1:37:07] and he was inspired see how the Holy Spirit kind of known a man but it's got
[1:37:13] to be in the order of the anointing I wish you'd write that down steady on
[1:37:20] that it's got to be in the order of the anointing the Holy Ghost fell in was in
[1:37:29] the street the Bible says in the last days I'll pour out my spirit on all
[1:37:33] flesh did it fall on the Zeus the street around the world no it fell on those
[1:37:40] that were sitting in Azusa Street praying for God to come in
[1:37:46] do something it didn't do it on 10th Street and 15th Street it done it on
[1:37:50] whatever the street was it would just to say that you pull out his spirit on all
[1:37:55] flesh don't mean it poured out on everybody in the world you got to get in
[1:38:00] a religious order come on see how this holy spirit could have known a man but
[1:38:08] it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside spirit can be
[1:38:11] anointed with the Holy Spirit holy goat and the soul as dark as pitch
[1:38:19] now where did he say you're anointed by the spirit on your spirit anointed with
[1:38:24] the Holy Spirit the outside spirit can be anointed with the Holy Spirit the
[1:38:31] soul is darkest be the cocklebur grows on the same water a little bill but the
[1:38:35] soul of it is cover raising only we get false teachers can rise teaching all
[1:38:41] kind of trinitarianism and everything else and be anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:38:44] and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but the word here that's
[1:38:50] what it does see what I mean now it's alright to teach this I guess he said
[1:38:56] I'm not in a denomination this was teeth is not in the world listen all right
[1:39:01] what is it go ahead is to what was that 9 ok going
[1:39:08] 10 I'm going to give you now this is modern events made clear by prophecy now
[1:39:15] we found out today that many people just can't believe it every spirit feel
[1:39:19] people even spirit-filled people I'm gonna give you one that'll choke you the
[1:39:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that
[1:39:30] don't have anything to do with your soul
[1:39:35] did he say how many times have I told you you're not mourning again in your
[1:39:40] body you're not born again in your spirit the only born-again in your soul
[1:39:46] you don't need the new birth it would be good to have it but it doesn't work
[1:39:52] don't have anything to do with the soul that's the baptism
[1:39:57] another baptism one in just a minute we're brother Brendan says the baptism
[1:40:02] of the Holy Ghost is just a temporal gift okay don't have anything to do with
[1:40:09] it that's the baptism see here's the inside soul in here that has to come
[1:40:14] from God but then on the outside of you you have five senses and find out inlets
[1:40:20] in your contact your earthly home the inside you have a spirit in there you
[1:40:26] have five outlets your conscience and love and so forth five outlets to that
[1:40:30] spirit remember in that spirit you can be baptised with a genuine spirit of God
[1:40:37] and still be lost in that spirit you can't be baptized in your soul be lost
[1:40:49] so it ought to be realized as what's happening something that spirit realm is
[1:40:53] where it's all that go ahead to the next
[1:41:00] yesterday that would have been number go to number 11 I got the baptism the Holy
[1:41:08] Spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's just a temporal gift for you
[1:41:21] baptism on your spirit is just a temporal guilt
[1:41:24] temporal means of temporary you realize that so that you have can be eternal
[1:41:33] that spirit is not eternal I don't care how much it's anointed it's not eternal
[1:41:40] that body is not eternal what do we need we need a change of this body and the
[1:41:46] spirit chain but - so we don't need nothing - yet other than the point of
[1:41:51] letting the word come in us and go back out because if your soul is born again
[1:41:57] it's eternal so what's he saying the baptism own your
[1:42:03] spirit it's just a temporal gift the real gift is your soul and down in Darcy
[1:42:10] that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the Word of God and
[1:42:14] the will of God and there you grow up you say well I belongs don't have one
[1:42:22] thing to do with it that if you don't line up with that word
[1:42:27] there's something wrong see you see your fall real father ain't
[1:42:32] God because that real start in your soul before there was even a spirit come on
[1:42:44] remember when it all souls are mine they ain't no such thing as your so
[1:42:53] belonging to the devil devil can't give you so the Bible said all souls are mine
[1:43:00] but it also says that soul that sinneth shall die it never says the spirit that
[1:43:06] sent us you'll die and this is a such solace why because you can't do it all
[1:43:11] right before that was even the spirit so your
[1:43:15] soul was first go back to Genesis 1:1 now right let us make man in our own
[1:43:23] image what do you make later soul
[1:43:28] come on that soul didn't come from God see let's let me read it because that
[1:43:34] real start in your soul before there even was a spirit it was your soul that
[1:43:39] soul didn't come from God then it wasn't a germ of God to begin with
[1:43:44] you deceived you're in a patch of weeds and burn the world's record of the weeds
[1:43:49] coming forth acting like the world loving the world it's because the love
[1:43:53] of God is not in you and now there'll be false anointed ones in the last days not
[1:43:59] Jesus's they wouldn't stand for that they're anointed with the spirit to do
[1:44:04] the signs and wonders that Christ did but won't line up with his word you
[1:44:14] wanna do like who was it Benny Hinn that walked out on the earth
[1:44:20] and turned and walked back anybody won't try I ain't going to cuz I know if I
[1:44:27] step off your mohit now God tells me to I'll do the best I can
[1:44:33] I'll tell I'll step out cuz I'm gonna argue with him but I'm just trying to
[1:44:37] get a point to you what about people that can do all kind of things like that
[1:44:41] you realize that Janice and Jam breeze could do everything Moses did bring
[1:44:47] everything Moses brought the one thing they couldn't do was take away their
[1:44:52] plagues read your Bible they could bring them but you couldn't take them away
[1:44:59] well well that would represent divine healing I believe that's right or the
[1:45:03] prophets okay let's see where do we get temporal get all right go ahead to
[1:45:10] number 11 what excuse me I'm gonna get my numbers right I'm still on number 11
[1:45:19] but we don't read that so lot go to the boy I'll leave it on well that's fine
[1:45:23] you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't mean that you're saved
[1:45:28] not by a long ways brother Dale you're confusing me I confuse the prophet
[1:45:37] blame him for confusing you and have I become your enemy because I found it I
[1:45:44] mean you're mad at me because I'm saying if you're lost brother Browns won saying
[1:45:50] it I'm just reading well you're fine it's me that's good
[1:46:00] you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that don't mean that you're saved
[1:46:04] not by a long ways looking here you are a Trinitarian or trying being you are
[1:46:09] inside this little fella here is the soul the next is the spirit neighs
[1:46:13] inside coming out right and the next is a body now you've got five senses in
[1:46:19] this body to contact your earthly home they don't contact the rest of it
[1:46:23] you got five senses of the Spirit here of love and rent and so forth like that
[1:46:27] but in here is where you live that's what you are the soul what are you and
[1:46:37] God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul brother
[1:46:46] Brendan said he had eternal life now you go argue that I got the quote so he said
[1:46:52] it he had eternal life well you know if he had eternal life Eve must have got it
[1:46:56] too because she had the same soul okay in the end of that you say well you're
[1:47:02] confusing that much more good maybe you'll go home and study
[1:47:07] alright let's see what else we got that's number number thirteen or that
[1:47:16] you're in a cycle of three which you're one person like father son Holy Ghost
[1:47:21] cycle of three but one person three attributes of the same guard fatherhood
[1:47:26] three offices like fatherhood sonship and holy go and you are body spirit and
[1:47:31] soul now the outside body has five inlets to it to contact your earthly
[1:47:37] home see taste feel smell in here the inside which is a spirit it has five
[1:47:43] senses conscience love and so forth but the inside of that but
[1:47:51] the inside of that the sole has but one thing all right now what's that's where
[1:47:59] you live but look the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain
[1:48:04] things and you do it but that don't mean you're saved
[1:48:11] think of it confers prophesied Judas cast out Devils see the spirit anointed
[1:48:18] him this rain falls on the just and the unjust and the spirit can actually make
[1:48:25] witness of it and still it isn't so because if that soul hasn't come from
[1:48:30] God it can make all the impersonations out there but it cannot be real you can
[1:48:37] act healing you can act you how you can act like you receive Christ Christians
[1:48:42] gonna act like you know they're Christians and that can ever end so good
[1:48:46] at it but that don't mean that you're saved that's exactly right
[1:48:52] the spirit can be there the real genuine spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you
[1:48:58] that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside soul that never dies
[1:49:03] it's got eternal life what about it
[1:49:15] let's go on to the next what's the next one fourteen or did we read it is that
[1:49:22] the one we just read okay now inside of that is a spirit which you become when
[1:49:29] you're born in to the earth and the breath of life is breathing to you that
[1:49:32] spirit of a world in nature because it was not given from God listen but it was
[1:49:38] given permitted by God why because it wasn't eternal a baby's not eternal it
[1:49:50] doesn't have an eternal body spirit though so his Spirit is permitted of God
[1:49:55] right what it was given permitted now you got that every child that's born
[1:50:00] into the world it's born in sins having an iniquity come to the world speak
[1:50:04] life that's right so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with but now
[1:50:09] it's got two five in listens that's the thing first I know it's doubt conscious
[1:50:14] and love choice reason there is five inlets to the Spirit you can't think
[1:50:21] with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in
[1:50:26] your body it has no mental faculties at all your
[1:50:30] body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't
[1:50:36] reason with your physical being because reason doesn't see touch feel smell or
[1:50:41] hear reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or if you're out
[1:50:47] your body is lying there dead but your spirit can still reason there is five
[1:50:52] senses that controls the inside man that now to the last man which is the soul
[1:50:58] there is only one sense that controls that and that is free moral agency what
[1:51:06] are you getting at what is the new birth well it's the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:51:15] the prophecy says you can have it every day your life let's still be lost what
[1:51:22] is the new birth it's the birth of the word the word is might alive in your
[1:51:25] soul then works back out through your spirit the things where I where go ahead
[1:51:32] all right and now the reason that people today
[1:51:35] they don't forget this now and you'll see what the what the initial evidence
[1:51:40] of the Holy Ghost is now let's read it now people can live in the spirit they
[1:51:45] can dance in the spirit they can shout in the spirit they go to church in the
[1:51:50] spirit and they can absolutely have the real Spirit of God anointing on that
[1:51:56] spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be without
[1:52:02] that spirit because their good thing gave me no hope
[1:52:13] I thought you're supposed to know the truth is most set you free
[1:52:18] okay where did we get to what's the next one number 15
[1:52:25] okay that's the top post in the church what's he getting to Sunday next time he
[1:52:31] remembers basic their spirits are anointed in this second realm
[1:52:37] what's the second real memory reason conscious affections that's where the
[1:52:41] Spirit is anointing from all right go ahead to the next you might dance in the
[1:52:48] spirit you might still speak with tongues and them things are fine but
[1:52:56] that's not it yet no sir remember the Bible said in the last days
[1:53:00] there shall come false Christ not false Jesus they won't stand for that false
[1:53:05] anointed ones they're absolutely anointed with the spirit with the Holy
[1:53:10] Spirit and still false there's - there's a third people three there's three
[1:53:18] people of you the outside of it is the body you've got five senses you contact
[1:53:23] your earthly home with it the inside of the spirit there's five senses dark love
[1:53:27] and conscious and so forth you contact but the inside of that is the soul see
[1:53:32] what is that the inside of that seed is a nature and that nature display
[1:53:38] displays itself it can stand in the same field right there with the weed the weed
[1:53:43] and the wheat stand together resourcing just as much its head is down if
[1:53:48] starving for a drink when a rain comes the cook of work and shout just as loud
[1:53:54] as the weekend but by their fruits you shall know them
[1:53:59] what are we going let's see if I can read two more I go ahead to the next one
[1:54:05] should be eighteen or what at seventy from Christ revealed in his own word and
[1:54:12] lie Sunday when we was going into these cycles about how that the five senses on
[1:54:17] the outer rim that's the end let five senses to the body there's only one way
[1:54:22] you can get into the body that's by these five senses see taste field
[1:54:26] smelling here see faith comes by hearing you got here
[1:54:28] for no other way to contact the body on the inside of that man is a man called
[1:54:34] spirit and he has five senses think thought and thought in love and
[1:54:39] conscious and also for now you can't think with your body you think with your
[1:54:44] mind and in there is where the many of Christians only stop they can just like
[1:54:50] the corn in the field and the weed in the field they can be anointed with the
[1:54:55] same Holy Spirit that the real believer is anointed with but down on the inside
[1:54:59] of that next room the third room is the soul and that's predestinated by God and
[1:55:06] those were the real seed germ layers is in dark right today so confused about
[1:55:14] the evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can impersonate any kind of
[1:55:18] a gift that God has but he cannot bring that word word by word now how do you
[1:55:26] know is whether or not that spirit in you agrees of the word you know you're
[1:55:35] sitting there on the town I'm going to illustrate it now so you're sitting
[1:55:40] there saying I know you're reading what the Prophet says but I don't believe it
[1:55:44] now what gives you that right if I said it you have a right to argue but if I
[1:55:53] read it what you just read part it come on you got it come on come on up here
[1:56:02] come here and show me where than I just handpick stuff that's why I wanted it
[1:56:07] all to be given to you because you can know at least is this was nineteen and
[1:56:13] seventy eight or nine I've been teaching this over forty years I don't have to
[1:56:21] worry not exalted just telling the God's honest truth because when God showed it
[1:56:27] to me he showed me what it was that anointing on your spirit but it doesn't
[1:56:35] mean you're Christian you can dice and shout this in the inside
[1:56:39] listen what is the true sign that's your Christian and give you body to be burned
[1:56:53] you can do all kinds of things do everything
[1:56:56] what's the sign the Prophet said whether or not your sighing and crying for the
[1:57:04] abomination have done in the city that's what I said when the brothers that we
[1:57:11] all know step down of course what he's done that's his business
[1:57:14] but I haven't come here and bound by lambasted him at all what I've prayed
[1:57:18] for him have you have you really prayed for it you have no right to condemn him
[1:57:31] to your first pray for now that's brother Dale I'm not quoting Jesus or
[1:57:35] brother branham that's the way I live I have no right to condemn anybody that I
[1:57:41] haven't prayed for him first right so what is it simple thing of the Bible
[1:57:57] there's Peter named the disciples Jesus kept pouring the word in then what had
[1:58:10] happened when the Holy Ghost fell under their Pentecost he didn't have to go
[1:58:14] down in here and get all this and stir it up it just come right across it
[1:58:18] there's like rain and dropped in and says it's alive but what happened to
[1:58:27] those that didn't what happened to Caiaphas when the Holy Ghost fell he had
[1:58:33] nothing for it to follow me God can't quicken word that's not
[1:58:37] genuine he can't quicken the Trinity because
[1:58:42] there's no such thing I can't be done do you wanted one scan all the way you can
[1:58:52] understand it got to bring them all to the same place
[1:58:54] and let that anointing be at the same place but what it does you took the word
[1:59:01] and held it it'll quicken that word but if we take the word and get our own
[1:59:06] ideas and thoughts he can't quicken that it's our responsibility to study the
[1:59:12] word and let the word be in the field that's just like standing out in your
[1:59:19] garden and sand Lord I'm glad my garden is coming up and I walk up I said well
[1:59:24] you got well I didn't plant nothing but it's coming up say why yeah okay see my
[1:59:31] bees going the stuff three years later we're still looking the same bean and
[1:59:35] corn ain't working that don't do it the same word comes to the whole people
[1:59:47] there ain't but one gospel it comes to all people but it's what we do with it
[1:59:54] let's take it take these home with you you got any questions let me know later
[2:00:01] we'll try our best to cover it I've never done this all right we're gonna
[2:00:06] well have no music nothing with a single song I love him and then if anybody
[2:00:11] hasn't need the altars open so I
[2:00:16] you have a need coming let's see well brother Dale what do you believe the new
[2:00:22] birth is it's the birth of the word that I've cooked and according to the Prophet
[2:00:30] each one of these is a birth so it don't end just by you getting the new birth it
[2:00:40] just begins that's one reason I know what I know because what he told me
[2:00:50] years ago I can stand right now and say thank you Lord even two personal things
[2:00:57] when he told me that most of the people in the end time would die and go by the
[2:01:01] grave the followers of this message I said that 40 years ago I'm not tobacco
[2:01:08] but in no way was I ever references to anybody that would be lost but see we
[2:01:17] don't want it that away why why can't you believe it Dunaway when he speaks to
[2:01:29] you what are you afraid of he told me years ago he said there'll be a lot of
[2:01:34] people come from Athens to Lola there's a lot of you standing here you were to
[2:01:46] say brother Dale even if you're a false and everything in the world wrong at
[2:01:51] least you said what I would do and I am now doing it what about it
[2:02:02] father we thank you for today and we ask you to be with us guide us and direct us
[2:02:08] in your love Lord we ask you to just forgive us when we fail you in the
[2:02:12] things that we bring forth and our own thoughts and ideas forgive us bring it
[2:02:16] out in your own self it's bless us as we go either naturally
[2:02:20] Oh bring us back this afternoon and Lord for the children too to sing in worship
[2:02:25] about you and then for brother Nathanael to bring the evening message to us Lord
[2:02:30] we just thank you for these young ones that are coming along that can take this
[2:02:34] message and cure it on because we're getting older we're dying away we're
[2:02:38] we're all pricing on the yet you have never have left us without anything
