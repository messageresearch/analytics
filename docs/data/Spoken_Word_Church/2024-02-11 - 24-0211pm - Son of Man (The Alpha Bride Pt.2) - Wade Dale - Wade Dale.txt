place at the right time good to be in the house of the Lord good to be back here in service um I enjoyed this morning I enjoy uh reading about the church ages and seeing what happened to those people back in the uh you know they had lives just like we did like said before they got up and went to work there were Monday back then too I think that started in the garden but uh amen amen so that's why I said I hope the Rapture takes place Monday morning just jerks us right out of here and we don't have to have to go to work on Monday be just tear the devil up cuz he's been he sure has been loving Monday for long all all my life he's loved Monday so get us out of here Lord all right let's remember brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday night next Saturday 4:00 pictures brother duck Gott will be with us we'll have a meal uh we're going to have um we're going to have something a little different um we're going to have uh New York strip and and some uh chicken breast and baked potato and salad so just come and eat you eat your uh eat your heart out make sure you um tell U tell each and every one that's in that's involved how much you appreciate it because it takes a lot to put this thing together our sister Lisa and sister Rachel and different ones it helps and then the that next Sunday this coming Sunday week Brother David gadman will be here for the 18th it'll just be one service and it'll be a regular normal service we'll have Sunday school and everything else too so just keep that in prayer also February 25th like I announced this morning brother John durett the second service will be doing a U uh Dave Ramsey Financial Peace uh class and uh weaving it into um our Christian Life uh to be good stewards and you know the Bible says oh no man no one and all those different things God but God's a che forgiver and uh he wants us to be the same way but you can't give if you don't have it so also I didn't say this morning but that's going to be every other month starting February 25th it won't be in March it be in April brother John will speak one Sunday afternoon all right but in between that on March the 10th that's why brother Joe wants the song leaders and musicians to get together next Sunday because on March the 10th the Second Sunday in March we're going to have the second service uh I'm going to be uh speaking just for a few moments to explain about worship and about what we um the way we're set up as a church Church to worship not just this church but church church worship and then after that he'll get with you this coming weekend next weekend um all musicians and all song leaders not an option all right unless you got something to do but from then forward the next week the next time we have it it will be a 2:00 uh the song leaders if you have two or three songs you want to um work on you'll get up here with the song leaders and it won't be a service you can leave if you want to you don't have to come to church but we'll have a singing and a worship service and we'll be practicing our songs uh some of the musicians have come to me uh wanting to get together so we can get everything in harmony get the right chords get the right um music get the right uh and and you say Well it don't matter just get up here and play no if you play for the Lord you need to play in right key so the song leaders and musicians nobody else you don't have to be here but song leaders and musicians you need to be here at least March the 10th and then brother Joe will I mean um next weekend and brother Joe will talk to you about then we'll start March 10th and then that afternoon um we will have a um it'll just be open if you want to if you want to coordinate with brother Joe if you want to learn a new special I know we all need to learn new songs um we all need to learn new songs not sing the same ones over and over that's okay but but let's learn some new songs let's get into a mode of worship as brother Joe said you know and now that we've let it out let's show it let's show God that we can worship because God's in worship word comes first but we do and the reason I'm doing this is is because most churches do this if you're a Community Church because like Pine Grove I mean they'll go over there 5 minutes all of them live 5 minutes from church well they'll all go over there one Sunday Saturday afternoon but see some of you live there's not a one of you lives within 5 minutes of here I don't think I think we're probably the closest ones at at 8 to 10 8 to 10 miles right most of y'all live at other places like like you know 30 minutes 45 minutes hour and something away and you can't just call everybody and say hey get up here Saturday and and we're going to practice just a small length of time then you got to go back back home then come back on Sunday morning so what we'll do is on Sunday afternoon we will just do that once every other month the month that brother John's not doing it we'll have another Sunday afternoon of worship and play bring your instruments play if any if you have a new instrument anybody got something to to uh to add to it please let us know we'll try to make space for you everybody understand that so next Sunday afternoon after the second after the first service all musicians and all song leaders that are here meet with brother Joe Canada cuz he's going to head it all up and then March the 10th will be our first time of of having a time of worship and learning new songs and learning the keys and learning the new if you want to learn something new I may bring my bass guitar you never know but we'll see y'all don't all fall our life at the same time so uh let's turn to turn the Bibles Revelations 1:10 and U I wish we were a community church where you could all be right here together and you wouldn't have to yeah I know some of you and it's hard on some of you that drive hours how long you drive hour and 15 minutes hour and 30 minutes so when we're still sipping on our coffee you know us that we live eight miles away brother Michael's harnessing the horse up and they're heading away they're heading up here and same way with a with a lot of you you know brother Bob then 45 minutes away what I'm saying is I appreciate y'all driving Brother Gary CR different ones appreciate y'all coming that length of time to uh to be in church service we sure do appreciate that and we want to be we want to be um uh mindful of that when we do decide to do something special is maybe try to do it while we're all here so uh we appreciate the Lord having giv us a church to go to anyway so we sure appreciate that more than anything and U give us the uh uh the song leaders that we have and the and the musicians that we have I mean man they're they're they're good top notch so just keep that in your heart and mind and we will uh we will start that next month Revelations 1:10 dear Lord thank you for this evening you've give us father I pray that you'd be with us now as we speak about you for a few moments Lord that you'll open our eyes and give us eyes sa of the Holy Ghost and give us ears to hear Lord what the spirit says today to the churches father forgive us of our sins and many mistakes heal the sick be with the foreign Brothers Lord that are taking the gospel the different places Lord I pray that you'd be with them Father and bless the ones that are that can't come here Lord that's watching online I pray that you give them a special anointing today Father just bless us now in Jesus name amen I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest right in the book now he told John take this and write it in a book and send it to these churches John didn't John didn't keep it he wrote it and sent it to them all right because it tells it says to the church in Ephesus it tells them what to you know what to do and what you've the salutation and the and the rebuke what thou seest right in the book and send it into the seven churches which are in Asia which is Ephesus smrna pergamus tharus Sardis Philadelphia and L us here now remember none of these none of these are in Israel right these are not Jewish cities these are Gentile cities so it was a gentile bride that God come after so he put those cities over there in Asia and made them a gentile um made made Gentile cities out of them and I turned to see the voice that spake to me and behold turning I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks went lik un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle you may be seated Lord add his now who was that that was the son of man but what form was he in he was taking now he had had he had had his form so many days 50 50 days before Pentecost he had had a form of Flesh he was in a glorified body he was walking around on the earth he could still eat fish and and all that and and he had substance he he was in a glorified condition but he hung around for a certain length of time and then he said I must go away in other words so that I can come back but what does he come back he doesn't come back back as himself in flesh he comes back in your flesh and my flesh Paul's flesh Peter all the different ones that's the flesh that he wanted to inhabit to do what to get the gospel and forward it to the people all right so he stands in the midst or the middle of all this he's right Among Us he's got both hands open he's got stars and he's got the uh Messengers and the Stars he I mean he knows what he's doing he's one he he knows what he's doing he knows how to started like we were saying this morning and he knows how to end it brother Aaron it might be that that needs to be off of heat and put on a little bit air conditioning cuz it's hot and U I'm I'm that much higher than y'all are and it gets a little worse up here but I know some of y'all are Fanning please keep Fanning maybe keep you from falling asleep the seven Church ages is a complete take a bowling ball hold it the seven Church ages is a complete and final revelation of Jesus Christ you you say brother way that's final it is a final final revelation of Jesus Christ to the Gentile bride there is no other Revelation there is no another church age there is no other denomination there is no other anything that's going to come to a gentile Church except the bride amen and when he leaves through us he leaves where are we a wedding supper and he goes and presents himself to the Jews no other Gentiles is going to be saved not one all right so we're at the end we're at the part right now to where we're at the finality of at all there is no other Church age there is no other day we're it that's why it's important as Bob said this morning it's important to be fervent about what we're doing especially now toward we're getting toward the end John 1:14 says the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we've been reading that forever well he wants to be in your flesh because this new dispensation was it was animal flesh that was sacrificed and it didn't do away with your sin now now Christ has come by a New and Living Way Christ came gave his own life so that he could come back inside the believer and make you him in another form called a bride everybody with me all right by a New and Living Way which he has consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh uh Sister Christine we were talking last Sunday we talking about the veil being rent do you know that Veil is was 4 Ines thick the veil that covered that Mercy Seat was 4 in thick and it was some I don't know astronomical 20 something feet high but it was rent from top to bottom that way they knew no man had went in there and ripped it from the bottom to the top it had to be God that rent it from the top and he just pulled it apart why because his brother B said if he would have turned and looked out the window of the temple they'd have seen the mercy seat sitting hanging on the cross all right so he moved from that a new testament or a New Covenant was which was in in his blood how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot Purge your conscience from dead words to serve the Living God God's whole intent and purpose is is to live in you and make you holy make you holy make you him make you able to defeat the Devil listen to me without him standing right here with us well that'd be easy you got God standing beside of you in a glorified body he couldn't even save you he could not he's got to be inside of you so the only way he could do that was was go away leave the body there as a as a sacrifice that that as an advocate that God can see that and see the blood and sends the spirit back down here so that he can go out into each one of us and live through each one of us that's pretty simple but it's very profound how God did that and and you know what he's perfect I didn't know if y'all knew that or not I wanted to start it off with the message God's perfect he don't make no mistakes whatever he does every move he makes he never has to say oh sorry didn't mean to do that no so everything he set up is exactly the way that's why he thought so much of that Alpha bride to set set everything up in that first church age everything the mode of worship Paul comes in and tells us what deacons are what Elders are what pastors are what this is he sets it up in the first day age then we then it gets so convoluted down through and I'll when we get back to the nickan part of it somebody ask a question and I'll explain a little more about that but what happens is the power got took away from the people in this middle part of the ages all right so now what brother Bram comes he comes here and he tells the people he said hey it's not one it's not a hierarchy here I was just reading just a few minutes ago in the Hebrew series brother Bri said if you as a church vote to preach Jehovah Witness Doctrine he said we must either preach it or vote us out you not a deacon not a bishop not even the pastor your vote so see you put it all back into the Ley where the Ley has a power of a vote and you know what brother R said he said now if it's 51 to 50 he said that 51 wins he said what are you that lost going to do about it he said if you got the holy ghost Hebrew series 1957 I believe it is he says you that lost get with the ones that won and let's get out of here in other words be no well my 50 I I voted against and I I just well you need to leave brother BR they asked him one time said said we got a de you got a deacon in your church that doesn't believe like you believe he said he ought to get rid he said we ought to get rid of him givis them in the body don't work for this cuse he is a mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance not one of them got the inheritance of the promise of eternal life in the in the Old Testament not one not here anyway we got a promise of Eternal inheritance right here where you're sitting today for where a testament is there must be necessary the testator's got to die in other words he's got to die to give the force to this his will all right everybody with me I'm going to keep I'm going to fly through some of this cuz we we know that the body that was a body was prepared over there and then that body come that body left and now he's in the body of Believers he's his his Corporal body is not here it won't be here until the Millennium all right we come back with him everybody all right with that we know that so where is his body now he has a bride body and everybody's got got a part to play that's why you got to take it out and quit Conquering the leoty you got to have the leoty have the power and then God can flow through everybody then not just a set of hierarchy cuz that's what happened in the first part of the church ages they said oh the people don't need to understand this we've got it in Latin we'll just just just believe on this guy uh let this guy well you know sister Anna you can't understand a word they say when you go to church at a Catholic church but you depend on who the guy read it and you don't understand nothing see that's took a power away from the Ley that's Conquering the Le so they go oh well okay no the power is in the people the power is in the the power is in the church amen so let's continue on I want to try to get to something so I want to try to get this get through some of this now we know and understand that each age has his messenger and it's message so God is a dispensationalist God does have dispensations all right everybody with me we are not in the Lutheran dispensation if we were then it'd be wrong timing cuz we're in the end this is time over here that we're in the end we're not in the Luther age Luther won't even get you in the body now not Luther the person the Lutheran Doctrine everybody with me cuz you see this is the way I I uh approach everything is the Holy Ghost is the same in every age we know that but there's degrees that man has either put their hand over or hierarchies try to keep it away from people but if Luther was to come in today and not just sit here because of me sit here and listen to message Believers preach amen he'd be like wow that ain't nothing but the truth man I I didn't know I'm sorry baptize me again amen baptize me in the name of Jesus Christ I didn't see that oh Hallelujah and you yeah he'd be one that'd be you'd have to sit him down cuz he looked through a glass Darkly he could see certain things but there certain things he couldn't see same way with Wesley Wesley's like you mean y'all wear dresses all the time you don't cut your hair Oh Glory you don't wear makeup that's right that'd be him because the Holy Ghost Inside of him it would Quicken the word that he held plus Quicken the word now that he held that's why me and you have to have fresh Mana every service because your Holy Spirit feeds on that just like we feed that's like we fed down there a few minutes ago your body needs food so the church body needs food to sustain itself if not if you conquer the Ley then it makes it cold formal and Powerless that's what brother brandom said all right cold formal and Powerless and that's what we've seen in a lot of places but so the message and the messenger are one they come at a certain point of time and then what God does is when he's finished with that messenger he takes him home right it's not for me and you to go well why did he take brother Brown he did every one more time God Perfect all right if he's got his hand in it God's perfect it's not ever going to be a mistake so we must just lay it in his hands yeah I know there's a lot of people see a lot of people put and I'll explain this a little bit later but a lot of people's Holy Ghost was brother brandom and when God took him off the scene their Holy Ghost left with them left with him and then they scattered off into this church and that church and this place and that place if you put you if you put your confidence in a man you see that a lot of times you know you see U um um not here but you see preachers that the pastor dies or goes off somewhere in adultery or something and and the people just well he was he's everything he was all I put my I hope you never put your Hope on me or anybody that preaches in this church you put your hope in Jesus Christ and if I tell you what Jesus said you put your hope in that and you'll not fail but you put it on a man you will fail cuz the Bible says right here if you don't do the right thing I'm going to pull your C listen God can do that he said I'm going to pull your Candlestick out you know when you pull a Candlestick out what happens it pulls it away from the oil that's down inside and what happens your fire goes out all right amen plain but not it wasn't as plain as Bob there was a lot of Band-Aids given out today big ones drag across the floor I started to say when I come in this morning I thought now everybody reach down pick your head up put back on your shoulders or brother Claude wisinger he called me one time he said man he said I just know I just know that y'all y'all's head separated from me I said what he said I was watching your dad last Sunday and he he cut down on something he said I know y'all's head had to hit the floor and roll he he said cuz mine did but you do it with Loving Hands brother Dell always did it with Loving Hands All right so look what happened a seal is open what's that a mystery is unfolded cuz each age had a mystery Luther had a mystery the mystery was as just shall live by faith the rest of the world said no put it on the Catholic Church let let let let the pope go do that for me let the priest go do that for me all right but the mystery of that was is that just shall live by faith come out of that thing come out of her my people same way with me and you the same way when you saw this message a mystery unfolded that you had not previously seen in the other part of your life or at a church somewhere else denomination or or something like that you saw something You' never seen before that's a mystery all right and why because of the message that you were taught you receive Revelation and a mystery from what's taught you don't get you don't get a Revelation from any from a a tree or or a piece of wood you get it from somebody preaching the message to you and then something Sparks inside the Holy Ghost says that ain't nothing but the truth let's go study that for a minute to me that's where you see a mystery unfold see a mystery is unfolded when it unfolds a trumpet sound so the mystery is going to unfold listen the prophet's going to get it first Paul irus I ain't talking about brother R he's part of it but I'm talking about all they get the message first they get it fresh from God and then they turn and they deliver it to the people well listen God's got so much confidence that when he tells that person he knows that person is going to turn around and tell the truth right cuz I God's perfect did I ever tell you all that he picked those Messengers brother Bown didn't pick them he picked them brother random just by Revelation got them out and Sh saw the characteristics of each one and told us it was Paul irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley and and Elijah all right but God picked them way before brother brandom did cuz remember he had those seven stars in his hand way back when now a church AE op so a trumpet sounds it declares a war uh look at Luther oh wow he went against the whole world remember what he said he said they said Luther said the world is against you he said let it be known I'm against the world the teaching of the Catholic church was all over it was like a cancer and here he stood out and said no the just shall live by faith and that was a war started and the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed in other words brother Brown didn't get all when he started progressive revelation but when he does he catches the mystery of God then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him Goes Forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to proclaim a message what does it start it starts a spiritual war and when God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep now we're going to get into something a little bit about lap over cuz remember God doesn't now he does take his messenger at a certain time but remember that message trickles on a little bit further CU you can't just stop brother random you couldn't take every tape right now and throw them away there's always going to be something somewhere out there some some MP3 something's going to be out there you can't just abruptly stop and say well brother R don't listen to him no more so that's the same way with Paul Paul had a message and he died he died in the in 86 60 something well the age started in the ' 50s and went to 170 so it had to be the people catching the Revelation which God knew they would and taking that Revelation and preaching it all but remember there was a time where brother brandham he even says he says one time he says he said you need to tell them and said you're not preaching what Paul preached is it time for us to say you're not preaching what brother Randon preached sure it is all the different doctrines we got the church but he puts them to sleep drops a plague upon them who reject it a temporary judgment then after that's over he goes on look they denominate bring in denominations and start off with that man's work like Wesley and all the rest of them gets all scrapple again then another mystery comes forth when did Israel get a deliverer when did Israel get Moses brother Bram said when when God heard the Cry of the people God sent them Moses so we've got to cry out each age cry out and says oh we need that but we need something fresh yes amen you and I have come to this part to where we need to know what we're knowing now not plus not somebody else not we go past the prophet no we got start understanding what he's already said praise the Lord I agree with that then another mystery comes forth what happens another messenger arrives on the earth for a church age in other words starts back up again in other words he shouts a trumpet he declares a war then what happens finally he's caught away when he's laid away the plague Falls spiritual death hits the church in other words what they all denominate and she's gone that group then he goes on to another now let's read this I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end so we were talking about the the book ends this morning excuse me the alpha church is Ephesus the Omega Church is leosa it's the beginning and ending of the Gentile bride dispensation all right and what God had at the first he's going to have the same thing at the end all right everybody with me on that so the pattern is we're going to see the pattern and we saw it some this morning you're going to see the pattern it holds through all the way till the end all right he was all all the letters but specifically he was Alpha and Omega he had a rainbow over his head which was the Covenant now look the line of Pentecost where it started gradually smothered out these men irenius polyart and all the rest of them sealed their testimony with their blood until it finally squeeze Christianity into the darkest of days which was the Dark Ages all right but everything started I want to get back over here all right let's just right here because I didn't read it this morning I did this but let me continue on with this masterpiece bless you every one of these churches coming down through here he revealed himself in deity only in his glorified form is everybody with me on that you this morning Paul had a complete clear understanding of one God Paul Peter had a complete understanding John had a complete understanding of one true and living God all right now it got as brother Brown said scrapp down Through the Ages well what had to come out on this side was the Supreme deity back again that Jesus was God not a second person not a third person but he was God Almighty but during the church ages they knew he was deity listen but they had him as a second person amen because of what not God because of man's ideas all right they had conquered so much to where they said oh just whatever the Pope says you know you take somebody I going to ask you a question I know sister Anna was a Catholic is anybody else a Catholic in here before brother uh Louise you take some of the things that they force on the people it's ludicrous it's down right funny it's not but it is that Mary took a Rapture I mean Mary you know Mary she's not buried she had she resurrected and she went up and she's the mother of God and then this one over here Patron saying of something other something happened and if you'll pray to that guy he'll get you across River or something you know you understand what I mean it sounds silly to us but hey I mean who in the world's going to pray and go 12 beads Pray Again 12 beads pray again oh it broke I need to go buy another one so go to the Catholic Church buy you another one you see how funny that sounds but it's it's not that was that was so much formed in those people's mind till they believed it and they'll kill you for it they'll kill you for it why can't we be fervent about the truth that way all right if they can do that and pray to this saint and pray to that Saint and anyway they have a place listen they got a place they're the old mother so that's what the Bible says so now look in the Masterpiece I didn't put this in I put this in this this afternoon it'll never be it at the Harvest Time look the seed is back to its original condition so where's the planting planted on day of Pentecost First Church age where's the Harvest at over here in the end time in other words it goes back the seed that is back to its original condition and must have all the word in order to be the seed now you can't have half a seed it won't grow am amen all right I believe in speaking in tongues that's just part of the seed uhhuh but now there is there is added to that Hallelujah the life not the gift gifts the life of the gifts see what I mean we're at the end time brother stock tassel husk is dead and dry now in other words if you planted a stock of corn before it's really robust and green and you put a lot of Nitra on it man you squeeze it and the water just runs out of it and it makes this big old ear of corn and and that ear of corn is when it's ripe to eat when we eat it it's just so juicy but the Stock's dead as a hammer the there's no life there anymore it dries up then all the everything else start drying up what happens is bless you there's a there's something going on here but that seed's got to be what that seed's got to put in the sun to ripen dry out and then you can plant that seed and start just like the original everybody with me all right so stop tal husk is dead and dry now that's why we can't go back to 1906 Pentecost we go to the Pentecostal blessing but you can't go backwards how in the world these people that leave the message go backwards they never had the forward there's only one thing that has to happen to that that's to be gathered in the world Council of churches for its burning the word has become flesh exactly like it promised in Luke 17 Malachi 4 and all that's right see Revelations all true life that was in the stock tassel and hus now listen when that when that thing was growing and it was a stock it had life yeah right it was real it was the part of the Corn but God moved out of that life to put all the strength that's why you prune something everybody with me that's why you prune around the suckers cuz what happens is that life's coming up through the root and if it has to go out here to a sucker which is just something that's there a a limb wasted energy cut that thing off everybody with me are you thinking spiritual now or we an apple tree and an apple orchard anyway so the life comes up and then it's got a shoot that runs out this way cut the thing off prune it because what happens is is that that plant's whole entire existence is to reproduce itself again the whole thing is for them to reproduce theirself again and to reproduce yourself again you got to go back to seed and for us to reproduce we got to go back to seed all right everybody with me on true life that was in the stock tassel and husk is now gathering in the seed that's where you that's why you really put the nitrogen to that corn when it starts making that ear because you know you want all that energy to make a big full ear corn because that plant's existence is is to get in and make that corn seed everybody with me same thing with the word of God like I said this morning God's going to have a bride he's going to have an enti bride is going to take a body change I don't care we can sit we can sit and say no no no the sun ain't coming up no no no the sun ain't coming up if you'll open your eyes about 6:30 in the morning you'll see the sun come up all right ready for the resurrection ready for the Harvest the alpha has become Omega amen the first come last and the last is the first the seed that went in has come through a process and become seed again the seed that fell in the garden of Eden and died there come back wow he went way back didn't he from from that imperfect seed that died there come back to the perfect seed the second Adam all right first EP fell we know that but look the Alpha and Omega is the same we become the same all right the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the last message of the same that's why I read you that quote the other day where brother Bram stood down across a curtain of time and he said did Paul make it the angel said yeah Paul made it he said I bless God I know I will he said I preach the same thing he preached and all them millions of people said we are resting on that right there there'll be a day that we won't be called day or night but in the evening time it shall be light see Alpha and Omega it's become the first and the last the Masterpiece we talked about the vision where brother Brown said the church came into to view once the bride comes into view twice all right everybody understand that if you don't remember Vision go back and read it all right that's the reason she was in View the second time she was reviewed the first time then the second time and she was perfectly the same the second time like she was the first time let skip through so we won't be Sate but the bride came back cuz she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor has made him a masterpiece for it's a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden and took a piece from and made another piece that was Martin fell now he's been all this time building up it up again and he brought forth this masterpiece and was smitten in order that part that was smitten was in order to bring back again he's saying that I'm saying this this masterpiece is what the prophet of God came to get so the Masterpiece and the Son of God the Masterpiece in the bride and it's a piece of him which must be the fulfilling of the word because we're going to look in another church age that even means the unfulfilled age they were all unfulfilled and until you accept the message of the hour and get all the doctrines correct and get our lives straight like the first church age we'll be the same way everybody with me they didn't believe in three gods in the beginning of the church you can't find that sort of belief amongst the apostles it was after the apostolic age that this Theory not a Doctrine Theory came came in and really became an issue in a cardinal Doctrine at the Nan Council the doctrine of the godhead caused a two-way split at NAIA everybody we've been through that all we know what happened the true bride went to NAA to try to turn it around and they left with their head down cuz this over here was so much stronger but God had to allow that to happen cuz remember the seed had to go in the ground right to come back through Luther and come back through Wesley into today Revelations 2 unto the angel of the Church of left of Ephesus right these things sayith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they're Apostles and are not and have found them Liars what' he do give them the word test and hath borne and hasth patience and for my name's sake H hath labored and hasth not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove your Candlestick out of its place except thou repent here's what we got to this morning but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I also hate you say God hates yeah God hates God's got emotion if y'all didn't know that or not he's the very seed of emotion Satan just twists his emotion and makes it something else right everybody with me S remember Satan is not a Creator he can't create one thing not one thing he is not the originator of nothing except chaos so whatever he gets he copies from God and makes it that close so that you can't tell the difference hardly so we looked at the word Deeds means an act or something done cuz in the first church age it just became as like a saying or or what's your opinion about uh um you know I can't be God he cried uh he can't be God he he got tired he slept in a boat he can't be God well well he close enough to God though let's make him let's make him something a little different but the same a that the way where do all doctrines come from talking to somebody else and then bringing in here amen yeah so nanism or nickan means Nico which is Victory or conquer which the word Nike comes from letin which is the members or the leoty and somebody asked what somebody said well how can you conquer a whole church you can conquer a whole church by being so forceful and so uh adamant about I'm the man you just got to do what I got to you just do what I tell you amen that to me that to me that just beats everybody down and we you know we I've seen it before it don't work but when you put everything in place like it's supposed to be did I ever preach that God didn't make a mistake okay so he didn't if he set his church up first right he said Alpha church is going to be right then he said Omega Church is going to be right all right they have been identical in two that held the doctrine of balam I remember what I told you balam was a hireling prophet they seem to have held that it was lawful to eat things sacrificed to Idol now look take that and put it in the message or a message or someone's message well you know come to church as you are we want everybody to come to church right we do and I agree with the statement Come As You Are but don't leave as you were or you just wasted your time that's right right come as you are that's fine but what it is says oh well that's okay you can stay here don't worry about it well I would lose people if I preach that remember what brother R told Brother Ram said I'd rather eat soda crackers for those of you that don't know what that is that's little bitty crackers about that big and they used to call them soda crackers now they're what are they saltines salting crackers same I'd rather drink Branch water and eat that and preach on the side of a street corner than to compromise on the gospel and I agree because if you don't you become a hirling and then you're just a hirling prophet and you just do what somebody else says they may have been identical in those who held the doctrine of balum they seem to have held it to where it was lawful to eat things sacrificed to Idols to commit fornication in opposition to the decree of the church rendered in Acts 15 so in other words they wanted to be a church listen Satan does not want to be in church right he wants to be here and he is but he wants to just change it one little way and that's all he needs to do to get you at all of us so it's the opposition to the decree of the church because remember when a when a when a a message Goes Forth what does it cause why does it cause a war because there's a opposing forces there's only two forces Satan and God that's the only two there is there's nobody well I just believe I well no you might be the devil okay only two sides devil side God's side there's no in between all right pick a side choose you this day Who You Shall Serve if it be God come over here if it be uh Janice or whoever the other was um who was it cor Corin Dayan choose them God stood there one day and said I've had enough right I've had enough and Moses said he said if you're for me stand right here if you're for daythan and cor go over there and God said I'm fixing to show you which side was right he opened the ground up literally opened the ground up and swallowed several hundred people and closed their back shut what a mess that was but that's God separating the good from the bad cuz he hates nickol latinism he said he did he hates all this he hates somebody coming into church and trying to change everything all right when it's supposed to be set up the way it's supposed to be set up all right so to hate these Deeds is a sign of life in a church that otherwise is weak and faithless to tolerate them is well n to Forfeit the glory of having been faithful under persecution so let's continue on the alpha church is born where was the alpha Church born it was born on the day of Pentecost all right but now the first church age didn't start on the day of Pentecost there was a Pentecostal age right let let me let me show you something right here real quick if I can get to it you have your um you got your chart there let's see brother Anderson if we can I'm have to can you still see that a little bit come on how about now you in the back no oh hang on a minute oh blow it up a little how about that can you see that kind of shorter that's the church age thing that I gave you a little while ago uh when brother Dale preached on the eight manifestations of God and then I preached on the porter this has been back lord 20 years ago almost now if if brother K know he knows exactly when he listen to them old tapes so if you got your Alpha bride right here right you got your Omega bride right here right their book ends they've got to be starting the same way are they different so in ad30 we'll get to it in a minute but I just want to show you this now in ad30 there was a Pentecostal age that Paul was not involved in amen ad30 when Jesus died resurrected 50 days later on Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell and an age began but it was the age of Pentecost no messenger Peter was the spokesperson not the messenger got it then there was an age began in ad 53 who was Paul who comes at the end of the Pentecostal age that's going to be real clear and for when we get to right here now I looked all over this church and asked all y'all I couldn't find no white out so anybody know what white out is and the kids are going what's that just masty race uh but right here right here should be Pentecost again because between that age and this age there was an age of Pentecost 1906 isza Street brother brandham was not a part of that wasn't even born it's 1906 he was born in 1909 he wasn't even born during this time that started but there was a Pentecostal age right here it was run by the Holy Ghost just like what fell at this Pentecost the the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost came himself on the day of Pentecost to birth and start the church not the church age start the bride all right same way with here that's going to happen here we'll see it later on there was a Pentecostal age no messenger brother Brown said the Holy Ghost came himself to bring this message and then what happened then brother BR just stepped out from that just like Paul Paul stepped out from that Pentecostal age cuz remember when Paul stepped out of that age it was a little bit different than brother Brown because when brother Brown stepped out of that Pentecostal age they were still trinitarians cuz they were at the end they needed to be turned back but now the first one when Paul stepped out remember when Paul came on the scene Peter and them had already receed the Holy Ghost like 20 years before he came on the scene or 15 years right but here's Paul that was killing the Christians not literally but causing them to blaspheme and and die every by with me he takes the scrolls with the Holy Ghost goes into Arabia or into Egypt or wherever he went and sat down and God revealed all that to him cuz he was a church age Messenger right then he comes out and he steps into that first church age and him and Peter's preaching the same thing he didn't even know Peter and he comes up to Peter and says oh we're preaching the same thing but then you got to remember when Paul gets the real revelation of that age Peter says he says things hard to understand in other words he's got a little more depth than I do okay is everybody with me so you see that happen on both ends Pentecostal age began Paul stepped out of that Pentecostal age and started a group of Ephesus brother random stepped out of the Pentecostal age of 1906a Street and then it was 1947 when he started preaching what we know is the message of the hour right a little while later but you'll also see that that brother Paul he said in the Bible he says I was one born out of due season in other words I should have been born in that Pentecostal age but I wasn't there was a there was a there was an opportunity for Paul Peter and them to bring the message and then Paul just steps right in well same way with brother brandom in 1950 if you'll watch that movie that they have of him preaching in Washington DC what did you tell the Pentecostal to people he said I was one born out of due time he said I should in other words I should have been born 1906 of Z Street no not born born again during that time all right cuz listen Peter was alive when the day on the day of Pentecost he was here he was just persecuting the ones that received the Holy Ghost not preaching the Holy Ghost all right so do you see that cuz we've got overlaps in between and we'll get into all that and we'll see how the the messenger comes at the end of the age and we'll see the manifestations of God but just see one thing for sure there was a Pentecostal age began here then Paul stepped out the messenger that was a Pentecostal age here that brother R stepped out and was a messenger everybody with me all right the Holy Ghost had to come back in power restore the gifts but they were still trinitarian so there were some things that that that brother Bram had to preach to get him out of that all right everybody with me all right so the alpha church is born and we know how it was born it was born on the day of Pentecost I don't have to go through this anymore now watch what brother this is what I was going to talk about this morning about the Thrones this is Jesus talking I didn't just put that in red that's what Jesus is saying behold I send the promise of my father upon you now this is Jesus when he's getting ready to leave and he's getting ready to come back on the day of Pentecost he's going to U the alpha bride is going to be born and it's going to be born right all right behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tear you in the city of Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high so what is the father what is that promise that they would receive the Holy Ghost right Shake Yourself they send the promise of the Holy Ghost I'm going to send you the comforter I'm going to send you what somebody to help you the advocate somebody to lead you and guide you into all truth which is the Holy Ghost now look now this is Brother Rand watch 1955 Switzerland said now his body with nail scars in it has not come back yet it's sitting at the right hand of God he's sitting on the father's Throne now you with me but when he comes back he's going to sit on his own Throne the Throne of David that he inherited now that's in what the Millennium amen all right that's when he comes in physical form but he's here now in spiritual form working through your body and my body the father's Throne Revelation chapter 5 watch I want you to notice I'm looking right down the fifth chapter he says fear not fear not you don't want to get scared about anything one of the elders said unto me weep not he's in Revelations five Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and loose the seals thereof and lo behold in the midst of the throne and four beasts in the midst of the Elder stood a lamb now watch what brother R says now what are those four combat beasts lonox man an eagle what is that a representation of that's the Holy Ghost everybody with me it's the Holy Ghost so he's talking about the Holy Ghost a lamb why didn't he see the lamb before the lamb had been seated on the father's Throne inside of the guards the four combat Beast or in other words the Holy Ghost John could not see in there he only seen those foreheaded or four Beast standing there or those four cherubs standing there guarding the holy place in the breach brother R said look where did it come from it come from the father's Throne where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised again he sat on the father's Throne sent the holy goes back this has been the father's Throne the whole through the whole church ages right but now remember Revelation 3:14 says we get to sit on his throne okay all right so we we'll cover that later on he raised up and sat on the right hand of God ever living to make intercession how does he make intercession by the Holy Ghost that's what intercedes for you it doesn't matter if I'm praying for brother for brother Louise it's the Holy Ghost interceding inside of me right right and that's why you ask prayer for this one and that one and you you want to have prayer you want the Holy Ghost to intercede for you okay so so the father's Throne Jesus said look the father's Throne is now the kingdom that's in power now cuz Steven when Steven was stoned he looks up and he sees what Jesus standing on the right hand of the father in other words on the throne right remember he says don't lay this charge to anybody because I'm going to read it in just a minute there was somebody standing there that had some significance when Steven got stoned so what step was making intercession because he said father don't lay this to nobody's charge and Paul was standing there Saul held the coats I was watching a movie one time of of of Paul and it was really what they done they throwed Steven out well they come running out of the they all had their robes on come running out of the Temple where they had condemned Steven Steven preached him a message he didn't leave nothing to be desired except that they were wrong they had killed Jesus so what happens is Paul stand or Saul is standing right here a young boy standing right here and as they run by him to get to where they can Stone him good you know you can't fight with a coat on so they take their cloak off and he's standing there like this and they're just laying their coats over him as they're running by to Stone Steven so he was there when the first martyr took place amen but he said father don't lay this to their charge and there stood Saul John 17 I prayed for you Jesus said I prayed for you I pray that you make it I pray that we be one I pray that you understand what I'm saying so when the day of Pentecost was fully come we know what happened a rushing Mighty Wind came and it filled the house where they were sitting as we were talking this morning and they all spake in tongues but when they went outside it was that everybody was hearing them in their own language what a what a revelation that was and there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under Heaven because Pentecost was a feast day and they all came from all over the country all over the world actually from all these other places so as we skip down through here Pentecost means 50 we know that so let's get through this real quick well it's hot oh here here's here's what he says watch th this is what Peter says this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost so there's your there's your answer what is the Father's Throne it's the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which you now see in here for David has not ascended into the heavens but he said the Lord said unto my Lord sit down on my right hand till I make thy foes thy foot stols you know how he's gonna do that he's gonna do that to me and you Heaven is my throne and Earth where we living today Earth is my foot stol amen I'm going to do it on Earth therefore let all the house of Israel know ass surely that God ha made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said Peter to Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do and Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you shall receive what the father's Throne the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and your children to all them that are far off listen he's sitting on a temporary place right let me get back to that cuz he wants to be sitting on his throne cuz that's where you and I are amen right everybody with me he sitting on the father's Throne making intercession for us down here but in Revelations 3:14 he said I want them to sit with me and my Throne as I have also overcome and sat on my daddy's Throne right so he's not on his the correct Throne he wants to be on cuz are we in heaven no the father's Throne now is right here he's making intercession he's not way over under somewhere he's right here but he wants to sit on his own throne and us be there with him that's his whole that's the whole part of him dying for what to get us to sit where he's at I like that for the promises to you and your children them the before off even as men as the Lord thy God shall call and then man 3,000 people were saved at one time what a water baptism now here's Peter real quick Peter on the day of Pentecost like I said before he wasn't the messenger he was a spokesman cuz the Holy Ghost spoke himself through the people there was no Messenger to that age all right Peter was a spokesperson before the day of Pentecost he was given the keys to the kingdom we find that he opened it to the Jews on the day of Pentecost and he went down to Samaria and opened it to them came back to the house of Cornelius and opened it there and he never had had to do it no more it was open to the world see like that the Holy Spirit but you remember Philip went down and preached the Samaritans and baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus only the Holy Ghost had not fallen on any of them so what did he do he called for Peter Peter had a key so they sent up for him that had the keys and he laid his hands on them and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them then we we Gentiles we're just heathens Romans Greeks and so forth we worship idols we weren't looking for a messiah we had no time for a messiah we had our own Gods our forefathers but the Jews were looking for a messiah so was the Samaritans because they were half je and Gentile now watch now I said this morning Jesus will appear to those who are looking for him if you're not looking for him only those that's all he is not obligated to the unbeliever but to the believer brother Dell told us many many times he said God does not adopt the devil's kids he adopts his own children all right it's your choice whether to be his child or not but to the believer he is obligated he is obligated to raise the believer up in the last days only to the believer now this what happened in the book of Acts this is during that Pentecostal time before Paul steps on the scene now and we'll stop right there and we'll get to it when Paul steps on the scene and they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple they went to church breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and single heartedness of s singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved Acts 3 ver4 it says Peter fast his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength I'm talking about the characteristic that happened in the Pentecostal age all right everybody with me all right acts 7:57 I didn't bring this one but I read it yesterday where even even they thought so much of those disciples and they knew they had so much power they would walk down the street and the people would lay down in front of their Shadow and God would heal them wow they were called Christians in Antioch because of why they acted like Christ acts 7:57 then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran to him with one Accord now this is Steven and they cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their cloth at a young man's feet whose name was Saul and they stoned Steven calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this s to their charge and when he had done this he did as all real Believers he fell asleep amen he didn't die he fell asleep so let's review this just a little bit we we'll be done age of Pentecost started ad30 because that was when Jesus was crucified 50 days later which he was died in ad30 so the day of Pentecost or their day of Pentecost was close to that in ad30 the messenger to that part of the of the age of Pentecost was the Holy Ghost Peter was a spokesman but Peter was not the prophet to the age everybody with me all right Acts 2 verse1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were one Accord in one place that came a sound from Heaven as a rushian mighty went they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they all were not just one person they all were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance watch Peter was the spokesperson and had the key to open the door to the Gentiles until Paul come on the scene and he had so much grace that he just stepped away and he said Paul says things really hard to be understood I don't I don't disagree with him but I just sometimes can't understand what he's saying all right and then this is the there it is I was looking for there it is right there same thing day of Pentecost there was a Pentecostal age and then the age of Ephesus began then the same thing over here in leosa we'll see that later on I want you to read this right if you can see this right here it says the messenger to the age this kind of sums up all that that I read you in the first seal so the messenger to the age does what condemns the world the messenger steps on the scene he immediately condemns the world cuz what's he doing there he's condemning the ones that turned away from back here all right then what is he doing he rebukes to previous age for getting away from Luther's message Wesley's message whatever you want to say and then he brings his message then as we said before there's a war begins a spiritual war here's what Paul Peter said and account that the long suffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you as also in all his Epistles hey Peter read Paul's writing in as also in all his Epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest or wrestle as they do also with other scriptures unto their own destruction amen acts 13:46 then Paul and Barnabas W bold and said this is necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourself Unworthy of everlasting life low who's he talking to he's talking to the Jews cuz Paul's a Jew he can speak to the Jews cuz he's a Jewish all right but he says I've told you all this I've spoken to you I seeing you put it from you in other words seeing you ston me and Barnabas you put us in jail Hey listen who was the worst persecutor of Paul the Jews judge yourself Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn this is in Acts 13 this is where we're going to stop right here Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so ha the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this when the Gentiles heard this they were glad that God had turned a message that was supposed to be for the Jews he turned it over to a bunch of stinking Gentiles and he took a bride out of that he said that's a wife I want to live with praise God and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad look and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as it were ordained to eternal life believed Romans 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceit that blindness in part has happened to Israel God literally blinded Israel's eyes right cuz he had to put them away amen cuz what did they do they went to Idols they went whing so he put them away and he blinded them blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness now watch until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in that didn't happen in the first church age right fullness happens in our age he was telling them there's going to be ages and ages but until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in I'm going to Blind Israel cuz remember when we leave out of here God's going to lift that blind off right God's going to lift that blind off and they're going to go we've been looking for a messiah and you two witnesses are telling us he's already come 2,000 years ago and he say yeah then they receive the holy ghost or they kill him one of the two am and so so is so all Israel shall be saved as it is written that shall come out of Zion the deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my my Covenant unto them now see he still got a covenant with Israel he'll never forget them and he he'll always have Israel there there's going to be 144,000 there's going to be all kind of things set up that's still in the Jewish Kingdom as concerning the gospel now watch as concerning the gospel now this is what Paul's preaching the gospel as not the Ten Commandments to them everybody with me now watch what he's saying as concerning the the gospel in other words what I have preached to you you've turned it down you become my enemy they are enemies for your sake but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake in other words they're going to hear the elect is going to hear and they're going to accept it you're going to turn me down and make me an enemy as whoever said that uh today about of I become your enemy Paul Bob did if I become your enemy cuz I told you the truth people get way more mad at you for telling the truth than they will a good old fat juicy lie cuz you manipulate a good old fat juicy lie and make it sound good but the truth NOP it's just the truth for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance for as ye are in times past have not believed God yet have now obtained Mercy through their the Jews unbelief even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also May obtain Mercy what's Paul saying look they didn't believe over here we're the Believers now but since we're the Believers now we're going to take what we have the mercy that we have and give it to them amen this same message is going to the is going to the Jews same message to show Jesus Christ in a group of people not that the messiah's coming not that they need a temple not that they need a a red heer not that they need any of that he's already come and they didn't know it they say where did you get those scars believe in Jeremiah somewhere like that he says in the house of my friends what 2,000 years ago when they put him on the cross amen Israel was one that said let his blood be on us and our children not the Gentiles the Jews did right so now let's look at the alpha age just real quick let's musicians get ready to come on the Ephesian Church age then started a. 53 Paul founded the church at Ephesus about the middle of the first century this enables us to set the date of the beginning of the Ephesian Church age about ad 53 and you'll see we got it back up there but remember the age of Pentecost ad30 to ad 53 all right then a messenger comes on the scene until the angel of the Church of Ephesus write all these things now watch this real quick musicians come on the key given to me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine this is out of brother Brown talking determine the messenger for each age is most most scriptural one in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible it is the Revelation that God never changes have I not said that before God don't change it is the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever in Ecclesiastes here it is an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done for the last time there will never be a change apply that to the church ages the kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's Ministry would be the example for all other ages what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do and all all other ages okay said he wanted to do it now we know exactly from the word which was recorded by the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit how the first or original church was founded we've been talking about that and how God manifested himself in her bride the word can't change or be changed because the word is God now look there's some bullet points real quick let's stand get done a little bit early thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there's no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed his pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church age closes like I said there was an age there there's an age here all right that original church was not organized by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated and despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true to God it stayed with the original word pattern now don't get LED astray here when I said that God and his ways never change I did not say that the church and its Messengers could not change ah there's where it happens the church isn't God so she can change but what I said was that because of the unchanging God with unchanging ways we can go back to the beginning and see the first and perfect ACT of God and then judge by that standard that is how it's done the true church will always try to look like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that every that every first one and the messenger to the churches having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that come the closest to Paul who was free of all men sold out to God Gave forth the word of God only and manifested Ed the Holy Ghost in power none else would do you have to work from the original as light begets like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her Founders at Pentecost and her Messenger will follow the Apostle Paul the first Messenger to the first church age it is that simple and that wonderful and who was a messenger it was Paul we'll talk about that the next time we we preach but um whatever that is read the book of Acts whatever happens in the book of Acts has got to happen today that was your first church age started in the book of Acts didn't start in Matthew Mark Luke and John started in the book of Acts that's when the New Testament started after Jesus died then you look all the way over here and you can't change your pattern that's why brother R couldn't say well now now now Paul now he's just a woman hater no he said Paul was right in what he said yes that's what I put my confidence in if Paul wrote 80% of the New Testament right he he wrote 80% of the New Testament right his writings ought to be a pretty good guy to follow and if brother brandham mirrored it and preached the same thing plus brought us to the seals I ought to be able to I ought to be able to go with this guy okay I ought to be able my the Holy Ghost and me ought to agree with the Holy Ghost of that person right there right pretty simple let's sing a song God bless you Lord Lord Lord you surely been good to [Music] me Lord You've surely been good to me Lord Lord You've surely been good to me you have done what this
