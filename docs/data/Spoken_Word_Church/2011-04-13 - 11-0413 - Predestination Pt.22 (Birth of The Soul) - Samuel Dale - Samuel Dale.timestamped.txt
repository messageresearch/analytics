[27:41] any other announcements I know I

[27:46] like turning your scriptures turn where
[27:48] we've been reading in Ephesians we'll
[27:50] only read like verse 3 through 7 and to
[27:53] get a point but then we will go to a
[27:56] very familiar scripture with all of us
[27:58] which will be John
[28:00] 3 and so let's just look at that
[28:05] Ephesians 1 and John 3 father we thank
[28:08] you for an opportunity of being out
[28:10] tonight and we pray that you would just
[28:12] come among us and not be just an
[28:14] onlooker to record our lives but be a
[28:16] per very preeminent one in our hearts
[28:19] and lives and we thank you for your word
[28:22] that you have given unto us and we
[28:24] Praise Your Great Name we give you all
[28:27] honor glory and praise and we commit
[28:29] everything to you now and ask you to
[28:32] just have your will and have your way
[28:34] with each one of us forgive our sins
[28:37] because that's what we want to do is
[28:38] make sure we're always covered lead us
[28:41] in Jesus name
[28:45] amen we've been just using part of
[28:47] Ephesians you know kind of uh on each
[28:50] one and we will get into the Lord
[28:53] willing on Sunday into like the adoption
[28:56] and things of trying to cover it so uh
[29:00] verse three Ephesians 1 blessed be the
[29:03] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[29:05] who ha blessed us with all spiritual
[29:08] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[29:12] according as he has chosen Us in him
[29:15] before the foundation of the world that
[29:17] we should be holy and Without Blame
[29:19] before him in love having predestinated
[29:22] us unto the adoption of children by
[29:24] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[29:27] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[29:29] of the glory of his grace wherein he ha
[29:32] made us accepted in the Beloved in whom
[29:34] we have Redemption through his blood the
[29:37] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[29:39] riches of his grace now if you would
[29:43] turn to John 3 and it said very familiar
[29:45] with all of us you know the new birth
[29:48] scripture cuz that's what we'll be
[29:50] dealing with
[29:52] tonight there was a man of the Pharisees
[29:54] named Nicodemus a re ruler of the Jews
[29:57] the same came to Jesus by night and said
[30:00] unto him to him Rabbi we know and look
[30:03] at the great
[30:07] honor that you know was
[30:10] given is we know thou art a teacher come
[30:13] from God now brother random says on
[30:15] Church AG book 141 that Jesus said I'm
[30:18] not the
[30:19] teacher I'm the
[30:22] sacrifice all right so now my point is
[30:26] we read the Bible and it's put in the
[30:28] Bible enough to what we need right but
[30:31] it's not necessarily everything that
[30:33] went on in the
[30:34] conversation right you understand so
[30:38] then when when Nicodemus you know come
[30:40] to
[30:41] Jesus they probably had greetings they
[30:44] had all kind of things that took place
[30:46] you know and and you know a discussion
[30:49] but then right in the middle of it you
[30:52] know Nicodemus says now now
[30:55] Rabbi we know that th are a
[30:58] teacher come from God all right now
[31:01] watch for no man can do these Miracles
[31:03] that thou doest except God be with him
[31:06] so he wasn't just talking about a
[31:08] teacher that's right you
[31:12] understand he wasn't just meaning you're
[31:14] a teacher he was saying we know you got
[31:17] to be
[31:18] right
[31:20] right because God don't back up error
[31:23] all right so we know you're right you
[31:27] know and and and and all and we know
[31:29] that God is with you okay then Jesus
[31:33] answered and said unto him now watch the
[31:35] two parts of what I want you to get
[31:38] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[31:40] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[31:43] borned again he cannot
[31:48] see
[31:49] understand see the kingdom of God all
[31:53] right Nicodemus sayth unto him how can a
[31:56] man be born when he is old see totally
[32:01] natural because without the new birth
[32:03] you cannot
[32:05] comprehend the scriptures right no
[32:08] matter if God is speaking personally to
[32:11] you you will not comprehend what he's
[32:16] saying all right you following me
[32:19] now can he enter a second time into his
[32:22] mother's W and be born now watch Jesus
[32:24] again verily Jesus answered verily
[32:27] verely I say unto thee except a man be
[32:30] born of water and a spirit he cannot
[32:35] enter into the kingdom of God that's
[32:39] right it's possible that you can see the
[32:41] effects of the Kingdom as my point you
[32:44] can see what's taking place you can see
[32:47] uh signs and wonders healings
[32:50] Etc you can see that I don't mean you
[32:54] understand but you can naturally see it
[32:57] so Jesus put it into a stronger form you
[33:00] can't enter
[33:02] it you can't enter it so you got to be
[33:04] able to see it before you can enter it
[33:06] right see that which is born of the
[33:08] flesh is flesh and that which is born of
[33:10] the spirit is Spirit Marv not that I say
[33:12] it unto thee you must be born again you
[33:15] may be seated the Lord had his Blessing
[33:18] to the reading of the
[33:20] word
[33:22] now we've been on
[33:25] predestination
[33:28] and we see that from the story of
[33:32] predestination
[33:34] that God
[33:36] doesn't predetermine things apart from
[33:40] his forn
[33:43] knowledge and then in his forn knowledge
[33:45] then he would know how many people would
[33:49] be
[33:50] saved and how many people would not be
[33:54] saved by his for knowledge not not that
[33:57] he desired it now remember the prophet
[33:59] said he desired and the scripture says
[34:02] it you know he desired that everybody be
[34:05] saved all right so then it's not based
[34:08] upon the desire of
[34:11] God it's based upon the fact that he
[34:14] knew all right by for knowledge okay
[34:17] then he could
[34:20] predestinate all
[34:22] right some people to come to the New
[34:25] Birth and it did on the day of
[34:29] Pentecost but out of a world of how many
[34:32] million Etc was may be
[34:37] there on that day only
[34:40] 120 received the new birth right right
[34:44] all right
[34:46] now see there was only 120 predestinated
[34:51] them to come to the New Birth there was
[34:55] only 120 that
[34:57] uh would be able to hold on to the
[35:01] word all right as the scripture said
[35:04] they took the word and held it see the
[35:06] scripture says that Jesus was seen of
[35:09] over
[35:11] 500 see
[35:15] Brethren after his resurrection right
[35:19] but evidently there was 3 about 80 of
[35:22] them or something there that they didn't
[35:24] hold on right now they could see now
[35:28] that's the point I want you to get they
[35:30] could see the
[35:32] effects of the
[35:35] Kingdom they could see the resurrected
[35:38] Lord Jesus Christ y right they could
[35:42] handle him they could eat with him they
[35:44] could fellowship with him for a period
[35:47] of
[35:47] time but yet they never got to enter
[35:52] into the Kingdom right on the day now
[35:54] I'm not saying they didn't later that's
[35:56] between them and God but it did say they
[35:59] were
[36:00] Brethren and maybe that means they later
[36:02] came to it I you know that's all right
[36:04] we're not trying to judge anything We're
[36:06] just trying to lay down a situation for
[36:08] you to look
[36:09] at but see some reason they didn't count
[36:12] it right worthy or whatever to go to the
[36:16] upper room to wait so then when we get
[36:19] back to the message from Romans you'll
[36:23] see that uh you know predestination
[36:26] start starts in the New Birth amen all
[36:29] right and it'll come out to be the uh
[36:32] you know the adoption of situations but
[36:36] you know and and remember one
[36:39] thing I'll get to it later in the
[36:41] message cuz this is just a kind of a
[36:43] background so keep it in in your mind
[36:46] until we can get back to it Sunday as
[36:49] what I'm trying to bring so remember
[36:51] this is a background Point let see you
[36:53] and I were born kin folks to the devil
[36:55] right amen so so God had to adopt
[36:59] us into his
[37:02] family that's right you so then we start
[37:05] talking about it in your new birth
[37:07] you'll understand then see basically
[37:09] everybody talks about adoption what you
[37:11] hear is they want to go up the pyramid
[37:13] but you got to get in the pyramid before
[37:16] you can go up the pyramid so keep that
[37:18] now in your mind until Sunday and then
[37:21] we'll see how that it'll it'll start
[37:23] unfolding maybe a little more of of
[37:26] about the the doings all right but see
[37:30] there was only like I said
[37:32] 120 out of the whole world and out of
[37:36] the thousands of thousands that had
[37:39] heard the Lord Jesus Christ and brother
[37:41] randam gave it one time about what 116
[37:44] to 1% or something I forgot it was just
[37:46] a very small minute number of people in
[37:50] the world that actually ever even seen
[37:52] Jesus or heard much of him but then you
[37:55] keep breaking that down no wonder it was
[37:57] only 120 you know in the upper room but
[38:00] now so follow the point now these people
[38:05] were predestinated to receive the new
[38:07] birth
[38:09] right because that would be the the
[38:12] point or the time and the word that
[38:15] would be unfolded unto them all right
[38:18] now so now we'll we'll drop back to what
[38:20] we're talking
[38:24] about why would Jesus
[38:27] tell the most learned
[38:32] man of the day Nicodemus was the teacher
[38:36] right he was the teacher of Israel amen
[38:39] you know he was T not
[38:41] sky and here he comes talking to the
[38:44] Lord Jesus putting all on the line of
[38:48] his life and job because he'd be
[38:51] ridiculed and everything else you know
[38:53] if people found him so he comes to him
[38:55] by night
[38:57] and
[38:59] seemingly it looks like that he starts
[39:02] bragging on the Lord
[39:04] Jesus you know right because we know
[39:07] that no man can do these things unless
[39:09] God be with
[39:11] him and immediately seemingly Jesus
[39:14] comes up with something that would be
[39:17] that was so contrary to what Nicodemus
[39:21] was right coming for cuz there's no
[39:24] record of what he came for you know he
[39:27] had heard of the Lord Jesus you know and
[39:30] all like that but it's not written down
[39:32] that he came for a reason or he came for
[39:34] this surely he had some
[39:36] reason but immediately the Lord Jesus
[39:40] says You must be born
[39:48] again and he was telling them then you
[39:52] cannot see or understand the kingdom y
[39:58] Nicodemus is looking at
[40:00] him
[40:03] Kingdom born
[40:08] again this man knows the
[40:11] Bible that's right right amen and he's
[40:15] trying within his mind to
[40:20] comprehend what the Lord Jesus is
[40:22] talking
[40:24] about see they believe they were the
[40:27] people of God right and they were until
[40:30] they turned the Lord Jesus down y
[40:33] right but they believe that they were
[40:35] the people of God they believe that the
[40:37] so in other words Nicodemus could be
[40:38] sitting there what if it was you that
[40:40] had never heard anything about it and
[40:42] and all like that and you you hear of a
[40:44] man doing great signs and wonders and
[40:46] you go sit down and and and you have in
[40:48] your mind that you're there for a reason
[40:52] right and seemingly the the man turns
[40:55] around to you and says just like he did
[40:57] to disciples you know they come up and
[41:00] said well these are gone he said well
[41:01] why don't you go too you know I mean
[41:04] that's just paraphrase in the language
[41:06] you know why don't you just go see right
[41:09] a lot of things in the Bible you know
[41:10] like the the little woman you know the
[41:12] the Gentile you know saying you know and
[41:16] Jesus
[41:17] said you
[41:19] dog so there's a lot of things sometimes
[41:23] seemingly hard to understand why
[41:26] it would be done that way but you got to
[41:29] remember one thing now you and I have
[41:32] different ways of approaching people
[41:35] right you know you may talk about one
[41:37] thing I may talk about another we may
[41:39] approach them this way we may approach
[41:40] them that way whatever but just remember
[41:43] now me and you we're carnal you know we
[41:46] we we may be led of the Lord to talk to
[41:49] somebody but maybe not letter of the
[41:51] Lord all to be said but just remember
[41:54] we're talking about almighty God right
[41:56] so there was no other or better way you
[41:59] say well it looked like he would have he
[42:01] would have said this and looked like he
[42:02] would have said that looked like he
[42:03] would said this you know to each one of
[42:05] the the Nicodemus or to the you know to
[42:08] the the Gentile woman you know or
[42:10] whatever or to the disciples why don't
[42:12] you go to Y it looked like maybe that he
[42:16] was being something where he just looked
[42:18] like he's running them
[42:20] off but now remember that's
[42:22] God right so don't question what he's
[42:25] saying to the
[42:27] people
[42:29] right well he could have said it a
[42:31] little different way well see that's
[42:32] your
[42:36] carnality well now he comes to Jesus but
[42:39] see our carnality would put him some
[42:41] other way but remember that was God's
[42:44] way and remember if it's God's way then
[42:47] there is no other way right and there's
[42:49] no better way right
[42:51] amen righten see we we comprehend in our
[42:55] mind try to figure out some better way
[42:57] right we approach somebody one way and
[42:59] that don't work we go to the another way
[43:00] we go to another way but God doesn't do
[43:02] that he just goes straight and says it
[43:04] and that's it it right so he says now
[43:08] Nicodemus you got in your
[43:10] mind
[43:13] something and maybe that was what he
[43:15] wanted to talk to him about right maybe
[43:19] he wanted to discuss with him the reason
[43:22] that he had heard him in in speeches
[43:25] that he in sermon you know that he had
[43:26] made that he was speaking of a
[43:30] kingdom surely Nicodemus wasn't blind
[43:33] you know to not knowing anything and he
[43:37] knew that he was speaking of a
[43:39] kingdom and he knew that he'd speak like
[43:42] that seemingly he must die to bring that
[43:45] Kingdom we see all of this is in
[43:47] Nicodemus his mind
[43:49] right and remember he's talking to
[43:51] almighty God that could know what was in
[43:54] his mind or thoughts
[43:56] all right but he says now but Nicodemus
[44:00] you got to be born again
[44:02] right you can go through all of the
[44:05] discourse about how that the wind
[44:07] bloweth and this goeth and that goeth
[44:09] and all up and down through there and
[44:10] all that's well and good but just get
[44:12] one
[44:15] point Jesus said except you'll be born
[44:21] again now here stands a
[44:24] man that thought he was born right
[44:29] mhm right now they knew as I've always
[44:33] said about it and believe
[44:35] it they knew about life and how you was
[44:40] born am and and Nicodemus wouldn't have
[44:44] had any trouble for the Lord Jesus to
[44:46] say Nicodemus you know are you a perfect
[44:51] man and he would have probably said well
[44:54] no right I'm not
[44:58] perfect but I've done the
[45:01] sacrifice I've done what God required
[45:04] for me to do and I stand under that see
[45:08] because he was a good man that's right
[45:11] now you're not dealing with somebody
[45:13] coming along you know thinks he's all
[45:14] this that and the other but I've always
[45:16] told you I believe that those
[45:18] Pharisees they laid on the fact that
[45:21] that
[45:23] circumcision
[45:24] yeah was the what set them aside and it
[45:27] did from the other nations of the world
[45:30] right see and and they believe that that
[45:33] circumcision was what would do away with
[45:36] any serpent
[45:37] seed
[45:39] existence man because it's you know it's
[45:42] odd that he would would give them the
[45:44] the the sign of
[45:46] circumcision knowing that what happened
[45:48] in the garden yeah he wouldn't eatting
[45:51] apples you know see he gives them the
[45:54] sign of circumcision and there laying
[45:56] heavily on it said we you chose us from
[45:58] Abraham you you know this is all in
[46:00] Nicodemus is
[46:03] mind and and yet Jesus seems to be just
[46:06] driving it even
[46:08] harder he said Nicodemus you can't under
[46:11] you can't understand what I'm talking
[46:14] about unless you're born again now that
[46:18] means born from above is the original
[46:21] translation I gave you some quotes from
[46:23] Brother random to show it it means born
[46:25] from above that's right amen all
[46:28] right
[46:30] now Nicodemus is said knew Jesus spoke
[46:34] of a kingdom and that Jesus spoke of a
[46:37] kingdom up in
[46:39] heaven he spoke of a father's Kingdom he
[46:42] spoke of a a coming
[46:45] day and there he's
[46:49] wondering he says you can't comprehend
[46:52] what I'm talking about unless you're
[46:54] born again
[46:56] right he turns and looks at him he
[47:00] says what good would it do me to go
[47:04] back and be born a second time I'm a
[47:08] smart man now you know he wouldn't have
[47:11] saying that you know how smart he was he
[47:13] said I'm sensible I understand what good
[47:17] would it do if you say I was born wrong
[47:19] the first time and I must be born from
[47:21] above what good would it do for me to go
[47:23] be born again go back my mother's wound
[47:26] and come again right you say I can't see
[47:29] I can't understand you and Jesus then he
[47:32] laid it down
[47:35] hard he said I say unto you Y unless
[47:38] you're born again you can't enter right
[47:41] to the kingdom I'm talking
[47:45] about Nicodemus is sitting blindly
[47:48] trying to figure out what's going on
[47:49] right y
[47:52] right you remember when somebody first
[47:54] started maybe talking to you about the
[47:55] the Lord you don't want how to do with
[47:58] it did you right we had a different
[48:00] reason than Nicodemus had Nicodemus were
[48:03] was a very religious man that's right
[48:06] but
[48:09] listen
[48:10] Nicodemus was like all mankind
[48:16] then and he
[48:18] says I don't understand
[48:21] you I just can't comprehend
[48:24] you right I'd like to
[48:29] know that was the reason I came was to
[48:32] try to get some understanding cuz I've
[48:34] heard so many things that you preach
[48:37] right and you spoke of a kingdom and you
[48:39] spoke of of of God up in
[48:44] heaven and you spoke of a a way that you
[48:47] know that we must get
[48:50] there they
[48:52] said this I just don't understand
[48:57] but see way that we would be we would be
[48:59] like the especially the Believers in the
[49:01] message that would say well well what do
[49:03] you mean I must be born again I believe
[49:05] the message right now isn't that the way
[49:08] people state it today I don't in other
[49:10] words let me state it the way they
[49:11] stated all I don't need a new
[49:15] birth I always was
[49:23] eternal now that's what you would call a
[49:27] worser
[49:29] deception than even the blindness of
[49:32] Nicodemus amen right right CU Nicodemus
[49:36] never laid anything
[49:38] on you know right all he would lay on it
[49:41] was this Natural Things of what would be
[49:44] right according to the scripture the
[49:46] circumcision was a point of setting
[49:49] aside they were a chosen
[49:52] people see right
[49:56] but the only
[49:58] way you can be in the kingdom of God is
[50:01] to be born from above amen you got to be
[50:04] born again amen it's not because you
[50:07] believe the
[50:08] message
[50:11] right it's not because that you you
[50:13] believe you know and you you say well
[50:15] well you know I believe everything that
[50:17] the Bible says I believe everything
[50:19] brother Brown
[50:22] says I wonder what he'd say today right
[50:27] I wonder what the Apostle Paul would
[50:29] say when he said have you received the
[50:32] Holy Ghost since you believed
[50:36] right you believe the prophet's message
[50:38] but have you received the Holy Ghost
[50:39] since you
[50:44] believe because see we're sitting in a
[50:46] situation of I I I I tried to explain
[50:49] things and I know in the carnality hard
[50:51] it is hard to do uh you know a good
[50:54] Baptist would say all Nicodemus had to
[50:56] do is
[50:58] believe right
[51:00] right poor Nicodemus all he had to do is
[51:02] believe now here's a guy that all he
[51:04] ever done was believe right m i mean he
[51:07] believer her from the day he born
[51:09] because he set aside for the job live
[51:11] the life everything was perfect Jesus
[51:14] never said one thing about him right
[51:17] almighty God setting there never told
[51:20] him as I said the other day in the
[51:22] message prior to this that you know
[51:24] people say say well what must I do to be
[51:26] saved well you need to quit this you
[51:28] need to quit that you need to stop doing
[51:30] this you need to go here you need to go
[51:32] you need to believe the message you need
[51:33] to you remember the message we
[51:36] brought but see Mankind's never ask it
[51:39] that way they ask what must we do to be
[51:41] saved yeah all right
[51:45] now but you
[51:49] see living a good life is
[51:52] wonderful but you can do that without
[51:55] the B baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[51:58] right that's right there's plenty of
[52:00] good people in this
[52:02] world that we're really in a realm make
[52:05] us ashamed of ourselves and a lot of
[52:08] them maybe not even claim to be
[52:10] Christians they're just good people
[52:16] right but have you and I been born from
[52:20] above
[52:22] right see Jesus was saying if I'm
[52:26] talking about a
[52:28] kingdom and I'm going to have a
[52:31] kingdom
[52:33] then you ought to know Nicodemus and I'd
[52:36] have to be king of
[52:38] it cuz I haven't come to introduce
[52:40] anybody else so now John introduced me
[52:43] but I haven't spent any time introducing
[52:45] anybody else cuz Jesus never done it
[52:50] right he spoke of his own
[52:53] self unless you believe that I am he you
[52:58] will die in your sins he never spoke of
[53:01] another one to come that's right that's
[53:03] right he spoke of the Holy Ghost that
[53:05] would come and live in the hearts of the
[53:06] people to make them into the Kingdom
[53:08] right but he never spoke of another
[53:10] person to come right amen cuz the Holy
[53:13] Ghost is that selfs sameed person amen
[53:16] and just just listen to my point now so
[53:19] I gave you about three quotes there
[53:21] where brother Brown was talking about it
[53:22] on the oncoming storm and and that's
[53:26] 1960 then he has the eagle stir at her
[53:28] nest in 1960 and and then one on uh
[53:32] questions and God being misunderstood in
[53:36] 61 he said we're to seek those things
[53:39] which are
[53:41] above cuz we're to be born from
[53:46] above a natural birth to go back and
[53:50] come back again would not change us
[53:56] right we would come through the same
[54:00] situation no matter if you was aund went
[54:03] back to a baby you would come forth as a
[54:07] sinner
[54:09] right all right see then we must be born
[54:13] from where Jesus came from
[54:17] amen and he came from above
[54:20] right he said if my if you know in other
[54:23] words if if my king was of this world my
[54:26] subject would
[54:27] fight but instead of that he said Peter
[54:30] put up your sword turn around put the
[54:32] man's ear back
[54:33] on that Peter had cut
[54:36] off had no reason no fight no no
[54:42] doing all right now we know then if he's
[54:47] speaking of you must be born from above
[54:52] right all
[54:54] right
[54:56] then Nicodemus could understand one
[54:58] thing being born from below wouldn't
[55:01] help
[55:02] you cuz that's what messed us up being
[55:04] born from below right if we' been if you
[55:08] come into the world with eternal life
[55:09] Jesus Christ didn't have to die for you
[55:12] right because you'd have eternal life
[55:15] from the kingdom he was talking about
[55:17] right and I don't believe that well you
[55:19] just don't believe the prophet well I
[55:21] believe some of
[55:22] it I just put it that way we in the
[55:25] church right here one day and door used
[55:28] to be back here you know and I won't
[55:30] call his name but this old brother he
[55:31] was here going to preach and we were
[55:33] going to have communion so I come in
[55:34] carrying the cups you know and
[55:36] everything and he seen when I got out of
[55:39] my other car and started in the church
[55:40] he said brother
[55:42] down he said all believers in the
[55:45] message have one
[55:48] cup well see I had done checked all that
[55:51] out you know and went back and asked
[55:53] brother Mo what they done to Tabernacle
[55:55] and he was there and took communion and
[55:57] they had many cups and all things I
[55:58] didn't went through all of that so I
[56:00] wouldn't going to argue and scream at
[56:02] him and say this that or the other I
[56:03] prove quote here quote there quote you
[56:05] know what I said to him I just open the
[56:06] door and let him in and I said well we
[56:10] believe part of the message oh I just
[56:14] arguably and say I said We Believe hard
[56:17] in the message so you know you say well
[56:21] you don't believe all what brother R
[56:23] said bring you quotes let's see there's
[56:27] the difference in it BR the quotes the
[56:29] prophet has said and let's see well he
[56:31] said we were born with eternal life he
[56:33] said yeah if you have eternal life
[56:36] that's
[56:38] right if you're born again you got
[56:40] eternal life that's right that was what
[56:42] he's trying to show Nicodemus all right
[56:44] but now let's get on with it we must be
[56:47] then born from where Jesus was born from
[56:50] right exactly but we know that we were
[56:53] all born here in this natural
[56:57] nature you know of ways and Kingdom and
[57:00] born in Satan's
[57:03] domain
[57:08] right looking at the kingdoms to me I
[57:12] got to thinking about this is just kind
[57:13] of meditating a little you know China's
[57:17] got a
[57:18] kingdom America's got a kingdom Russia's
[57:21] got a kingdom right huh what I mean by
[57:24] that is what Prophet said he said if you
[57:26] go to China they got a nature about
[57:28] him he said you go to this country you
[57:31] go to that country he said you come to
[57:32] America he said we've got a as brother
[57:34] Claud said the other day we've got a
[57:36] life and joking nature about America
[57:39] right right man we're whistling as the
[57:42] little boy was going through the
[57:43] graveyard kind of make out like that
[57:44] we're not afraid which that's the reason
[57:46] we're whistling but you know that's
[57:48] still we've got our nature right about
[57:51] us because a nature then will begin to
[57:54] deal deal with what we're trying to talk
[57:58] about see if we were born into the wrong
[58:01] Kingdom which was born into the kingdom
[58:03] of
[58:05] Satan then we can see easily why the
[58:08] Book of Ruth was
[58:09] written everybody knows the story there
[58:12] in the Book of Ruth
[58:13] right the Book of Ruth was written to
[58:15] show us the things you know of how that
[58:22] uh the way God would deal and what would
[58:24] take place
[58:26] and in the Book of Ruth there was born
[58:30] you know one was more kin folks to
[58:34] Naomi than Boaz
[58:37] was
[58:39] right there was a closer K than Boaz
[58:43] amen now Boaz then he wants he knows he
[58:49] got to get Naomi never how you pronounce
[58:51] her name there I but said you know to
[58:54] but to the point he he was really
[58:56] interested in Ruth right y well to me
[58:59] now that's what brings the whole thing
[59:01] to
[59:02] pass because that's the way I look at
[59:04] the Book of Ruth I love
[59:07] it see then Boaz he's smart enough to
[59:10] know
[59:12] that when he says to the Kinsman you
[59:15] know he said redeem your
[59:18] right he said I'll redeem it y read the
[59:21] book of
[59:22] Ruth he said I'll redeem
[59:26] now Boaz he's got to be smart enough to
[59:28] figure out something then so what does
[59:30] he say he said okay now you get
[59:34] Naomi but said Just remember
[59:37] now if you get
[59:40] Naomi Naomi's done too old so we're
[59:44] we're not thinking about having any more
[59:46] kids through you and
[59:48] Naomi but said the law requires that you
[59:52] take
[59:53] Ruth right
[59:55] and that you bear a child un through
[59:59] Ruth and that child will be put back as
[1:00:02] being the lineage from her husband you
[1:00:06] remember her husband was dead right
[1:00:09] instead it being the lineage and and
[1:00:11] that way the name won't diminish off the
[1:00:14] Earth and uh
[1:00:16] so being a Jew now this is a natural
[1:00:21] story see it's got to be a natural story
[1:00:23] cuz Jew didn't want to do with the
[1:00:25] Gentile see he was willing to take Naomi
[1:00:28] right and there was property involved
[1:00:30] and there was all the things that he
[1:00:32] would get you know and everything but
[1:00:34] when Bo said but you got to take
[1:00:38] Ruth he
[1:00:40] said she's a
[1:00:42] gentile and I'm not bringing a gentile
[1:00:45] into my house and having babies by her
[1:00:50] and let the first one go back to her
[1:00:52] husband a gentile
[1:00:55] you know maybe a Jew or whatever the
[1:00:57] name but a gentile would be in in
[1:00:59] enlisted all right so the Book of Ruth
[1:01:02] is a wonderful
[1:01:04] thing it shows
[1:01:06] us and I gave you a quote from kinsman
[1:01:09] redeemer I just wish you'd read that
[1:01:10] whole message number four on your
[1:01:12] notes cuz it shows
[1:01:15] us that we had one more kin to us that's
[1:01:21] right cuz in the story there more as was
[1:01:25] typing
[1:01:26] Christ Ruth the
[1:01:30] bride and this guy that was had the
[1:01:33] right to
[1:01:36] redeem was Satan the
[1:01:39] devil see you and I were born kin folks
[1:01:42] of the devil whether you like it or
[1:01:44] not but I don't see why you wouldn't
[1:01:46] like it why you going to talk about
[1:01:49] redeem take out all these words out of
[1:01:51] the prophet's message you know ex them
[1:01:54] out of the Bible of you must be born
[1:01:57] again and and you must be redeemed and
[1:02:00] and all these things and if you're lost
[1:02:01] and and and all of this and if you have
[1:02:04] to have a kinsman redeemer why don't you
[1:02:06] ex all them out of your Bible and out of
[1:02:08] the prophet's message if you're going to
[1:02:09] S oh he always was eternal y That's
[1:02:13] right go
[1:02:15] ahead but I would just exal them things
[1:02:17] out of my Bible I rip them
[1:02:20] out and and I'll heck you what a man
[1:02:23] told me one time he said
[1:02:25] you know them them gifts over in 1
[1:02:27] Corinthians 13 said they need to be just
[1:02:29] taken out of the Bible just ripped out I
[1:02:31] said hand me your
[1:02:33] Bible I was grein he knew better to hand
[1:02:36] me that Bible I'd give him $500 bought
[1:02:39] another Bible if it had took
[1:02:41] it but I was going to rip her
[1:02:44] out because that's what he said you
[1:02:48] order to be taken out I'm just going to
[1:02:50] rip it
[1:02:52] out I was being mean I was just
[1:02:56] grinning and I knew he wasn't going to
[1:02:57] do it so he wouldn't let me have his
[1:02:59] Bible all right but now listen he never
[1:03:02] said no more about the gifts will be
[1:03:03] taken out either but anyhow now listen
[1:03:07] the prophet of God says that you first
[1:03:10] belonged to
[1:03:14] Satan our natural
[1:03:17] birth because of the fall in the
[1:03:21] garden now we dealt with Adam and Eve
[1:03:25] but then we move over now to Cain and
[1:03:29] Abel the the first two
[1:03:32] children sure everybody would agree that
[1:03:35] Cain was
[1:03:37] lost but they want to make some kind of
[1:03:39] a lineage thing out of
[1:03:42] Abel well if it did I'm sorry your
[1:03:45] lineage ended because Abel got killed
[1:03:47] before he had the children so you got a
[1:03:50] problem with your lineage
[1:03:52] doctrines see
[1:03:56] all
[1:03:56] right but you see everybody then
[1:04:03] borned you know into the world except
[1:04:05] Adam and
[1:04:07] Eve we would all be born in Satan's
[1:04:09] domain
[1:04:12] right right belonging to the devil yeah
[1:04:17] whether you like it or not the devil was
[1:04:20] your
[1:04:22] husband he was
[1:04:27] your
[1:04:30] Redeemer you belong to it we all
[1:04:34] did right no no I I was always a child
[1:04:38] of God well all right go ahead yeah I'm
[1:04:42] just still oldfashioned enough to
[1:04:44] believe in
[1:04:46] Redemption you know and believe you must
[1:04:48] be born again that's right
[1:04:53] now
[1:04:54] see then if we belong to him the prophet
[1:04:58] said who
[1:05:00] Satan he was the one in in the Book of
[1:05:04] Ruth he had the right to redeem but he
[1:05:08] didn't do it brother R says it you know
[1:05:10] the statements he made he said Satan
[1:05:12] can't cast out Satan he said Satan can't
[1:05:14] become a redeemer he said because it you
[1:05:17] know where would you redeem you to
[1:05:20] that's right he is from hell where would
[1:05:22] he take you take you with you
[1:05:24] no he ain't redeeming you you just
[1:05:26] belong to it that's right so you don't
[1:05:29] have to do anything to go to hell right
[1:05:32] except deny Jesus Christ right right
[1:05:35] because that's automatic it's not
[1:05:38] something that he's going to redeem you
[1:05:40] it didn't cost the devil a
[1:05:42] thing he didn't pay no price to get you
[1:05:45] and
[1:05:49] me we wound up belonging to it right
[1:05:53] right and the guy guy you look at in the
[1:05:55] mirror every day is the devil just
[1:05:56] looking back at
[1:05:58] you because you know what I'm going to
[1:06:01] say you're not born again in your body
[1:06:03] you're not born again in your spirit
[1:06:05] you're born again in your
[1:06:08] soul you're not saved there's plenty of
[1:06:10] people that are Christian saved in body
[1:06:13] form that don't go out and do cuz they
[1:06:15] keep theirselves from doing things
[1:06:17] there's plenty of people then are in the
[1:06:19] anointed Realms of of that and that's
[1:06:21] the biggest portion of Christianity is
[1:06:24] the reals of what is called the anointed
[1:06:26] ones and and they go to church and do
[1:06:29] more than you and
[1:06:31] I serve God more than you and I ever
[1:06:34] even think about it y but yet they're
[1:06:36] not born
[1:06:43] again see Satan was our King y that's
[1:06:48] right you know it's kind of odd I watch
[1:06:51] things you know I'm sorry I I'm not like
[1:06:55] what people you know I don't watch
[1:06:57] things like other people seemingly do I
[1:06:59] don't mean that way cuz other people
[1:07:01] look around and they'll watch brother
[1:07:02] colie if they see him do something wrong
[1:07:04] yep yep yep yep yep yep they got their
[1:07:06] eyes on him you know they're looking at
[1:07:08] people that way I don't look at people
[1:07:10] that way right I look at people as
[1:07:12] people right and give them an
[1:07:15] opportunity but I tell you one thing I
[1:07:17] do look
[1:07:20] at I look to see what you do about the
[1:07:23] word
[1:07:25] and see how you'll handle the
[1:07:28] work see I thought that was a way we to
[1:07:31] was to know the spirits right whether
[1:07:33] they be of God or
[1:07:36] not you know the old Pentecostal way
[1:07:38] look them in the eye you know oh I'm
[1:07:41] Discerning your
[1:07:43] spirit no you don't discern Spirits by
[1:07:45] that you discern it by the
[1:07:48] word cuz that can be fooled and messed
[1:07:50] up but see I keep my eyes upon what you
[1:07:53] and I
[1:07:55] and are thinking about the word y that's
[1:07:57] right that's the part I watch okay see
[1:08:01] because I know that we're all born kin
[1:08:04] folks to the devil that's right and that
[1:08:07] the new birth doesn't take place in your
[1:08:09] body
[1:08:10] right that's where we go on to into the
[1:08:14] forms of one day that the adoption has
[1:08:16] to come to the basis of the Redemption
[1:08:18] of this
[1:08:20] body all right page 49 future home
[1:08:23] brother said Soul's redeemed said the
[1:08:25] body's waiting Redemption yeah that's
[1:08:27] right now so you're not born again in
[1:08:30] your spirit because that Spirit won't
[1:08:31] work and I've explained it to you how
[1:08:34] that brother Bram you watch him up until
[1:08:36] 62 on the greatest battle ever fought
[1:08:39] and you'll find him up through there not
[1:08:41] all the time because he was a prophet
[1:08:44] and God was speaking to him but
[1:08:45] basically he was preaching what Body
[1:08:48] Soul Spirit
[1:08:51] right but after this the the greatest
[1:08:54] battle ever fought from there on you'll
[1:08:55] find him saying what Body Spirit Soul
[1:09:00] right all right to me now it was done to
[1:09:03] where people can come up with the fact I
[1:09:04] get a New
[1:09:05] Soul the Bible doesn't say that Bible
[1:09:08] says you get a new spirit well the word
[1:09:10] soul and Spirits interchangeable up and
[1:09:12] down no that's all right all those are
[1:09:15] well and good but I hope by now you're
[1:09:18] beginning to see that brother Dale
[1:09:20] believes that a soul is real amen that
[1:09:23] it's a real
[1:09:24] you that's the part I'm trying to deal
[1:09:27] with that's right I Don't Preach to
[1:09:32] bodies I Don't Preach the
[1:09:37] spirits cuz you can sit right there and
[1:09:39] H Glory hallelujah amen and denying
[1:09:42] every word I'm saying that's right and
[1:09:45] everybody in the building thinks you're
[1:09:46] right there with me
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:51] right but I hope you get to point that
[1:09:54] I'm trying my best to make the soul the
[1:09:56] real you right right it's real it's not
[1:10:00] just a a a thought it's not just a a
[1:10:04] wind something blowing around in some
[1:10:06] spiritual being that's somewhere in some
[1:10:08] other category or fitting in the inco
[1:10:11] our compartment in your heart
[1:10:15] yeah it's the thing that lives on
[1:10:18] whether you're Christian or or lost it's
[1:10:21] the thing that lives on after death
[1:10:25] it's the thing that will have to come to
[1:10:26] judgment to be
[1:10:30] judged right that's right it's the real
[1:10:33] you who does it look like you
[1:10:38] y yeah would that be something me wind
[1:10:41] up one of these days and get all this
[1:10:43] change that everybody talks about and me
[1:10:45] look like Brother
[1:10:48] Ray and then him having to look like me
[1:10:51] that's going to take a whole lot of
[1:10:53] stretching shrinking right
[1:10:56] right
[1:10:58] he no I believe Brother Ray is going to
[1:11:00] be the same height
[1:11:03] Etc that he is and I will be too right
[1:11:07] cuz I don't believe in getting a new
[1:11:09] body right I like what uh brother who
[1:11:12] was it listen to Brother Richard the
[1:11:15] other day maybe brother CLA one of the
[1:11:16] two just said recently maybe brother
[1:11:18] Claud was talking about it that uh job
[1:11:23] he said in this he said though you skin
[1:11:26] worm destroy this body he said yet in
[1:11:27] this body I'll see God this flesh in my
[1:11:31] flesh see he didn't believe in getting a
[1:11:32] new one absolutely Jesus come up with
[1:11:35] nail prins and his he believe getting a
[1:11:36] new one but see that ain't going to
[1:11:38] change anybody that thinks that's right
[1:11:40] right amen you know why cuz they can't
[1:11:43] see
[1:11:45] right amen amen that's right you get it
[1:11:49] they can't
[1:11:51] understand n that's right they're just
[1:11:54] like
[1:11:56] Nicodemus they can't
[1:11:59] understand so thereby they can't
[1:12:02] enter
[1:12:04] now see we
[1:12:07] understand at least I'm trying to get us
[1:12:09] to
[1:12:10] understand that we were born in
[1:12:15] Satan's domain right that's right amen
[1:12:18] this doesn't belong to God now he paid
[1:12:20] the price yeah sure all right but he
[1:12:22] hadn't claimed yet right Satan's still
[1:12:25] The Prince and power of the IR he's
[1:12:27] still the controller of the world right
[1:12:30] sure we know God's in control we
[1:12:32] understand yeah but we know who the
[1:12:33] devil is
[1:12:35] too but see Jesus said you must be born
[1:12:39] from where I am he said he double stated
[1:12:42] it you know what the prophet said
[1:12:43] anytime the Bible double States itself
[1:12:45] you know for sure it means pay close
[1:12:47] attention it says verily verily I say
[1:12:49] unto thee you pay close attention
[1:12:51] something fixing to be said that verily
[1:12:53] is not not
[1:12:54] enough verly verly right step it right
[1:13:02] listen that's the reason he's doing that
[1:13:05] cuz he doesn't repeat
[1:13:07] his but let's go back now look at
[1:13:10] something CU Jesus said and I know what
[1:13:12] this is about but you better believe
[1:13:14] it's all about everything I know what
[1:13:16] Jesus said in the scripture he said but
[1:13:17] from the beginning it wasn't
[1:13:20] so I know that's talking about marriage
[1:13:22] and divorce
[1:13:24] okay but I know it's talking about me
[1:13:26] and
[1:13:28] you amen see from the beginning it
[1:13:30] wasn't so right we wern't planned to
[1:13:34] come this way no that's right but God
[1:13:38] knew by predestination for knowledge
[1:13:41] that we would come this way amen but he
[1:13:45] didn't make us come this way we had to
[1:13:46] make a choice
[1:13:48] amen and in doing it see then he would
[1:13:53] see what it would take place and he
[1:13:56] would see that he would have to
[1:14:00] come but he couldn't send an Angel
[1:14:03] that's right he couldn't send a son
[1:14:06] that's right he had to come himself
[1:14:08] Amen in the form of the
[1:14:13] man our form our being are like us right
[1:14:17] to be a
[1:14:20] Kinsman to take away the perversion
[1:14:25] all right
[1:14:28] now so he
[1:14:34] predestinated of
[1:14:37] people to come to the new birth
[1:14:43] right that's been all the way down to
[1:14:45] there that's right amen all right ever
[1:14:48] born again
[1:14:49] believer because what he done he knew
[1:14:54] that if he put us the prophet said on
[1:14:56] free moral
[1:14:57] agency and I know a lot of people don't
[1:14:59] believe that you know but that's all
[1:15:01] right I'd still rather have whosoever
[1:15:03] will cuz the prophet said I'd rather say
[1:15:05] that than say William Brandon right cuz
[1:15:08] there might be some more of them but
[1:15:11] see but he permitted us to come the way
[1:15:16] that would make us into a fallen
[1:15:19] condition and then when that would come
[1:15:22] down through
[1:15:25] look at number five on your notes and
[1:15:27] North it not
[1:15:30] 1965 he said that
[1:15:34] spirit is permitted of
[1:15:37] God not
[1:15:40] given now hold on a little
[1:15:45] bit what's he saying are you reading it
[1:15:49] he said permitted of God not given now
[1:15:52] what's he saying
[1:15:56] all life comes from God right right so
[1:16:00] it's
[1:16:02] permitted why would you say not
[1:16:07] given because it would not be the plan
[1:16:10] of
[1:16:14] God right it wasn't the plan of God for
[1:16:17] you and I to come the way we
[1:16:21] come his plan was for us to come the
[1:16:23] correct way
[1:16:26] right everything was there but he
[1:16:30] knew that that would never take place
[1:16:32] that way so he permitted a
[1:16:37] life but he didn't give it in a fallen
[1:16:43] estate now you understand why did I
[1:16:45] hammer it so
[1:16:48] hard that there's no way God can create
[1:16:52] anything
[1:16:54] sinful that's right he cannot create
[1:16:56] anything
[1:16:58] wrong but he can create things perfect
[1:17:02] right he created a perfect world we have
[1:17:04] turned it into a sinful condition
[1:17:08] righten he didn't I didn't say Eternal
[1:17:11] there's a lot of difference between
[1:17:12] perfect and eternal right
[1:17:15] amen our bodies come from Mom and Daddy
[1:17:18] as perfect as can be made that's right
[1:17:20] for the time and the day and the
[1:17:22] elements May we live in but it's still
[1:17:25] perfect
[1:17:27] right our spirit is permitted of
[1:17:31] God not given sinful right but permitted
[1:17:36] to come into being right man
[1:17:40] perfect cuz how can he create it
[1:17:42] imperfect amen if he created it
[1:17:45] imperfect you he can't blame you for
[1:17:47] being wrong right that's plain
[1:17:49] language just take it what you want to
[1:17:53] so your soul when it was created was
[1:17:55] created perfect not Eternal a lot of
[1:17:58] difference in the
[1:17:59] word but perfect cuz how could it be
[1:18:03] anything and I'm talking about ever
[1:18:05] Soul
[1:18:09] right I believe that Abel needed
[1:18:12] Redemption just as much as Cain
[1:18:14] did cuz Cain was a living Soul right
[1:18:19] yep now don't get it tied up back there
[1:18:22] any it remember remember the Beast had
[1:18:24] no soul right that's
[1:18:26] right now that's what your Prophet said
[1:18:28] so don't get it tied up in there and
[1:18:30] think it's I'm saying something wrong
[1:18:31] the Beast had no soul
[1:18:34] right that's right cuz he was an
[1:18:37] animal and an animal doesn't have a
[1:18:42] soul right but Cain was just as much a
[1:18:45] human being as AEL was no matter who the
[1:18:49] daddy
[1:18:50] and or whatever that's what we want to
[1:18:52] do get into some lineage if I could find
[1:18:54] my lineage and run it back to to Adam I
[1:18:56] could believe I saved well you ain't
[1:18:59] going to get no further in the ark
[1:19:00] anyway right you sure would mess up
[1:19:04] there and why would you want to go with
[1:19:06] that kind of a line that's
[1:19:09] right like brother CLA was talking about
[1:19:11] those signs and everything there the
[1:19:12] Zodiac and all I really enjoyed it cuz
[1:19:18] see I
[1:19:21] believe that you you might be born under
[1:19:24] a three four Aries or Leo the line or
[1:19:29] whatever you do it and then you'll say I
[1:19:31] can't hit it I born this way I guess I
[1:19:36] just born to be
[1:19:41] mean what people don't realize is you
[1:19:43] can take that zodiac and I can take it
[1:19:45] and I can pass it out right here in this
[1:19:47] building and 90% of you would agree with
[1:19:49] what I pass out as being
[1:19:51] you and I'd copi it out of some
[1:19:54] dictionary somewhere it had nothing to
[1:19:55] do with anything what you're talking
[1:19:58] about but see that's where I believe
[1:20:00] when you're born again I believe all
[1:20:02] born again Believers are born under the
[1:20:04] same side right
[1:20:06] amen you say is it Aries I ain't worried
[1:20:09] about it's Heavenly right amen that's a
[1:20:12] sign I want to be under as a Heavenly
[1:20:14] sign cuz Aries has got enough junk in it
[1:20:18] right right to give us problems
[1:20:21] right I hope you understood what brother
[1:20:23] Claud was saying cuz you know I talked
[1:20:25] to him later see you got the Zodiac just
[1:20:27] say a word word to make sure you
[1:20:29] understand you got the Zodiac that's
[1:20:31] covered just like so many days of a
[1:20:32] month and you got 12 signs for the year
[1:20:35] Y and that happens every month right you
[1:20:38] know but then he was talking about the
[1:20:41] heavenlies of way above that in that it
[1:20:44] comes around every 2100 years or
[1:20:46] something
[1:20:48] right M and you think about it there's
[1:20:51] 2,000 years
[1:20:54] from the Garden of Eden to the to the
[1:20:56] flood
[1:20:58] right see then Noah I mean Abraham comes
[1:21:02] on over there yeah after then right then
[1:21:07] you can move it on over 21 22 23 2400
[1:21:10] years or something here comes Abraham
[1:21:11] along you know here comes Moses along
[1:21:14] see born under all them signs and things
[1:21:16] so don't get the two mixed together in
[1:21:18] your mind right right just listen to
[1:21:20] what the man was talking about we are in
[1:21:22] the age right and I've taught you over
[1:21:25] and over that brother Brown's message
[1:21:27] began in
[1:21:28] 1963 y the message that was to be
[1:21:31] brought beginning the seals right the
[1:21:33] other was a a restoration back to what
[1:21:37] it was already in the written form am
[1:21:40] that's right we're in the age of the
[1:21:44] water barrier the son of man that's
[1:21:47] right yes sir how many knows where I
[1:21:49] started that at 1969 brother brandham
[1:21:52] was talking about son of man in 1949 47
[1:21:55] or something yep right but then he
[1:21:58] finally entered his ministry that's
[1:22:01] right in the correct order right we're
[1:22:03] in that day in that time
[1:22:06] amen cuz that that doesn't deal with son
[1:22:09] of man doesn't deal brother R was a son
[1:22:10] of man but in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:22:12] he's part of the son of man the son of
[1:22:14] man is the Lord Jesus Christ in the body
[1:22:16] of the Bride of Jesus Christ okay get
[1:22:18] off that listen but you see brother
[1:22:21] Brown says you're Spirit was permitted
[1:22:26] y but not
[1:22:28] given now he's got to be explaining
[1:22:31] something because God is the only one
[1:22:34] that can give a spirit
[1:22:37] right even a
[1:22:40] body brother said you tell me how all of
[1:22:43] them wiggle taals and things running
[1:22:45] around in there he said it's not the
[1:22:46] first one it meets he said it's all
[1:22:51] predestination but when when you come
[1:22:52] into the world God permitted us in a
[1:22:55] fallen condition for Mama and Daddy to
[1:22:58] bring a body that we could live in
[1:23:00] that's right
[1:23:02] amen but that our spirit and our soul
[1:23:05] would be created of him to bring to us
[1:23:10] amen and that Soul being the real
[1:23:13] you that would make us perfect not
[1:23:17] Eternal but would make us what Mortal
[1:23:20] Mortal remember how you say it RT
[1:23:23] everybody SP that's right mortal beings
[1:23:26] all people
[1:23:28] right all people born in sin sa iniquity
[1:23:31] com from the world speaking lies I'm
[1:23:34] sorry if you think you were the only one
[1:23:36] that got left out of that situation I'd
[1:23:38] like for you to explain to me how you
[1:23:40] got it
[1:23:43] right cuz Jesus Christ didn't have to
[1:23:46] die one person could get it right that's
[1:23:48] right but now listen let's get down to
[1:23:51] something because this is what this is
[1:23:52] the message
[1:23:54] part then I believe that your soul is
[1:23:58] the real
[1:23:59] you
[1:24:01] amen we'll get down to one on the
[1:24:04] Redemption of the body one of these days
[1:24:05] and you
[1:24:07] know brother Gary I don't believe you're
[1:24:10] predestinated to look like
[1:24:12] me that's
[1:24:15] right that's right I believe we're
[1:24:18] living in the
[1:24:19] body that can be redeemed amen and we'll
[1:24:23] be turned back young right and we'll be
[1:24:26] Eternal one day amen that's right we're
[1:24:28] not going to get a new one n that's
[1:24:31] right we already got it so the
[1:24:33] predestinated plan of God is coming to
[1:24:35] pass right cuz remember it's not the
[1:24:38] person that comes predestinated
[1:24:40] eternally but the word or seed well if
[1:24:42] the word says these days the day of the
[1:24:44] change then that's
[1:24:45] predestinated
[1:24:48] right that's right right that's pre how
[1:24:53] brother how can you believe that we're
[1:24:55] going to take a chance I believe
[1:24:56] somebody is cuz it's
[1:24:59] predestinated which means Destiny was
[1:25:01] determined before the world ever begun
[1:25:03] amen that somebody was going to be
[1:25:05] standing here and that word and that
[1:25:08] Spirit would connect together and we'd
[1:25:10] be changed okay so you can see I'm way
[1:25:13] down here and the way up you where the
[1:25:15] message where I'm trying to get to all
[1:25:17] right see but what happened in the
[1:25:20] garden you know in the fall of mankind
[1:25:22] and all the way down and so just bring
[1:25:23] it on down to ourselves cuz like I've
[1:25:26] always told you when the baby's born I
[1:25:28] believe it the baby's born as I said the
[1:25:29] body is is perfect as can be made from
[1:25:32] Human elements of w coming you know in
[1:25:34] the perversion and life and Etc but
[1:25:36] still as perfect as can be and real good
[1:25:39] thank God for it and all them little
[1:25:40] parts are working in the work everything
[1:25:42] just right on time and even like Brother
[1:25:44] Gary the blood may run this way and run
[1:25:45] that away and mind and run that way and
[1:25:47] his but you know how this
[1:25:51] working he God made all of it you know I
[1:25:54] mean he didn't make it to be
[1:25:56] wrong but you might find out one of
[1:25:58] these days we're all wrong brother GE
[1:26:00] and you in the right
[1:26:02] shape like I've always said they say
[1:26:04] your heart is
[1:26:07] were it's right in the
[1:26:09] center you know but get on to it listen
[1:26:14] so what happens to a baby when it's
[1:26:18] born all
[1:26:21] right
[1:26:22] now as far as body and
[1:26:25] spirit when it's
[1:26:28] born it's just like any animal this
[1:26:31] morning did you understand what I said
[1:26:33] body and
[1:26:35] spirit it's so amazing
[1:26:39] though because in that body and spirit
[1:26:42] realm why don't we act like the
[1:26:45] animals I think we do sometimes monkeys
[1:26:48] that's all
[1:26:51] right but you can take a a baby and let
[1:26:55] it be
[1:26:57] crawling and you know what it'll come to
[1:26:59] the edge of a table and it'll just fall
[1:27:01] right off the
[1:27:03] floor
[1:27:05] right did you take a
[1:27:08] dog from the time it's just enough to
[1:27:10] where that they can almost hardly see or
[1:27:12] whatever you put it on the same table
[1:27:14] and it get to the edge and look off it
[1:27:16] won't
[1:27:17] fall maybe they're a little smarter than
[1:27:19] we think they are right my point is that
[1:27:23] there's a difference between the dog and
[1:27:24] the human what and that's the soul right
[1:27:27] that Soul has to be motivated or
[1:27:35] trained are you
[1:27:37] listening bird
[1:27:39] dogs are born bird
[1:27:42] dogs they have to be trained to make
[1:27:45] them good bird dogs yeah I'm better but
[1:27:47] they'll automatically point
[1:27:51] right
[1:27:53] I get tickled about it but thinking
[1:27:55] about how those dogs will do and cats
[1:27:57] will do and animals will do and cuz they
[1:27:59] born that is that nature about him
[1:28:02] that's
[1:28:02] right in that Spirit
[1:28:06] realm not no soul that's right Spirit
[1:28:10] real all right see so what happens to
[1:28:14] the
[1:28:17] baby God gives it
[1:28:19] life permits it to come
[1:28:23] lets it
[1:28:25] live gives it a
[1:28:31] soul Satan immediately takes over as I
[1:28:34] say you know and I like to make that
[1:28:35] illustration that there are the little
[1:28:37] babies laying in the cradle and has just
[1:28:39] been born right from the mother and just
[1:28:41] been stanked and Made Alive you know and
[1:28:43] here comes the nurse blankety blankety
[1:28:46] everybody fussed and arguing and
[1:28:47] screaming at each other you know and all
[1:28:49] these babies coming around and the poor
[1:28:51] little old things start starts off here
[1:28:52] and all that right you said does that
[1:28:55] have anything to do with it
[1:28:58] well where did we get the natures that
[1:29:00] we have oh yes of course I born under
[1:29:04] Aries who in here had born Leo who's
[1:29:06] who's Leo Brother D are you the Leo no
[1:29:09] he's a taus okay he's he's a bullhead I
[1:29:12] be hard he's a bull but see we blame
[1:29:16] that for that
[1:29:19] right yeah you know
[1:29:22] we can't help
[1:29:24] it and a lot of that has to do with it
[1:29:27] that's right but you know what brother R
[1:29:29] said about those angels that
[1:29:35] fail he said they give you a nature
[1:29:40] right those that fail give you a nature
[1:29:44] we found that back under about the ones
[1:29:46] that didn't fall they have to do with
[1:29:48] the ARs of Salvation is right but see
[1:29:51] the one ones that are Fallen then they
[1:29:54] jump right over on us and start
[1:29:56] perverting us
[1:29:59] what what part of you starts being
[1:30:02] perverted it's not the
[1:30:04] body right it's not the
[1:30:11] spirit it's the
[1:30:15] soul that begins to be
[1:30:18] perverted see then what's Satan doing
[1:30:25] he begins to revert us are see this what
[1:30:30] a lot of people don't agree with me
[1:30:31] about because they'll say the Soul's the
[1:30:32] nature the spirit Spirit is the nature
[1:30:34] of the Soul that's fine but what are you
[1:30:35] making
[1:30:37] it you just making it in
[1:30:40] nature then we're no more than an animal
[1:30:43] right we just we're just different in
[1:30:45] the point bird
[1:30:47] dog cuz they got that
[1:30:50] nature
[1:30:52] they survive they live they build their
[1:30:55] houses
[1:30:57] right what's the difference between us
[1:30:59] and a
[1:31:00] dog it's a
[1:31:05] soul right but that soul that nature of
[1:31:09] Us coming from God because only God can
[1:31:14] create I give you a quote I think in
[1:31:16] your something yeah the devil cannot
[1:31:18] create on anointed one the end time
[1:31:20] right the devil can't
[1:31:24] create then you go to the Oneness of
[1:31:26] unity 1958 brother said God made man to
[1:31:29] thirst Satan only perverts The Thirst
[1:31:32] it's what I told you no matter where
[1:31:34] you're born in the world you find people
[1:31:37] as are far north as you can go to alasas
[1:31:40] or Africa or anywhere and you find
[1:31:43] people
[1:31:44] worshiping they're God right
[1:31:49] why because they are a
[1:31:52] soul and that Soul knows that it's got a
[1:31:56] makeer
[1:31:59] right Satan then starts perverting the
[1:32:02] nature of that Soul amen it's not the
[1:32:05] soul Soul's okay right
[1:32:08] right he starts giving it a nature
[1:32:11] that's
[1:32:13] right starts telling you you got to be
[1:32:15] this because you're a zodiac sign I
[1:32:17] don't even read them I refuse to even
[1:32:19] read the zodiac sign right amen I've
[1:32:22] been that way for 40 years and I refuse
[1:32:24] cuz I used to read them and they' read
[1:32:26] in there boy you're going to be blessed
[1:32:27] today and I'd find out I always was
[1:32:29] blessed but then didn't say material
[1:32:31] wealth's coming your way not end today
[1:32:36] broke I quit yeah that's right I just
[1:32:40] refuse to even read you know why I do
[1:32:42] because see what I tried my best to tell
[1:32:46] you you think that zodiac sign is your
[1:32:50] controller and and you'll lean to
[1:32:53] it because you'll say I can't help it
[1:32:57] you'll blame somebody for what you are
[1:33:00] you'll say I'm just like my
[1:33:07] daddy
[1:33:09] right people tell you act just like your
[1:33:14] daddy why I want to act like my daddy
[1:33:17] from heaven right amen I don't have to
[1:33:21] act like my daddy
[1:33:26] dad my daddy had a lot of good traits
[1:33:28] about him what to say but I still don't
[1:33:30] want to be like him I want to be like my
[1:33:31] heavenly father brother CL said I found
[1:33:33] out I'm not the son of of Hannah and Sam
[1:33:37] Dale right I'm a Son of God Amen I want
[1:33:40] to act like my
[1:33:42] father I want to be led of that but get
[1:33:45] what I'm talking about look what I'm
[1:33:47] trying to get you to see the
[1:33:49] perversion and by that you'll see why we
[1:33:51] must be born again cuz Satan immediately
[1:33:53] starts upon the
[1:33:55] baby I don't care if it's born you know
[1:33:58] what I'm fixing say it's true it don't
[1:34:00] matter if Mom and Daddy are both
[1:34:01] Christians right that don't make the
[1:34:05] baby a Christian right he'll still lie y
[1:34:10] everything will take place and Mama
[1:34:12] Don't Lie daddy don't
[1:34:17] lie who was it the twins back there and
[1:34:19] brother BR said Mom and Daddy both was
[1:34:21] Christian one of those come forth acting
[1:34:23] like the devil the other one come forth
[1:34:25] acting on God's
[1:34:28] side what is it see Satan begins to he
[1:34:34] don't worry about your
[1:34:36] body sure cuz we're in a fallen domain
[1:34:39] yeah all right we're under the subject
[1:34:41] of sin yeah and all these things starts
[1:34:44] hitting the body yeah yeah but don't
[1:34:46] worry about the body right cuz the Bible
[1:34:48] says don't worry about the body right y
[1:34:52] he said don't worry about who can
[1:34:53] destroy the body right what does it say
[1:34:56] you better be concerned about he that
[1:34:57] can destroy the soul right amen okay
[1:35:01] Satan begins to deal with us and pervert
[1:35:04] the nature of that
[1:35:09] Soul he begins through memory reason
[1:35:12] conscience affections and things coming
[1:35:15] down into to pervert the nature of that
[1:35:18] Soul because we're one unit right
[1:35:23] that's why the soul that sinth it shall
[1:35:26] die why your New Birth has to come in
[1:35:29] the soul amen Satan starts dealing right
[1:35:33] there to pervert the nature he cannot
[1:35:37] create that's where you two Soul people
[1:35:38] said Satan give you a soul God give you
[1:35:41] a
[1:35:42] soul Satan cannot create I gave you that
[1:35:45] once the end time 130 paragraph 139 ano
[1:35:49] once the end time the devil cannot
[1:35:51] create
[1:35:53] anything that's right
[1:35:55] amen God made man to
[1:35:59] thirst Brother Richard Wilson was
[1:36:01] quoting one night uh not for life I
[1:36:03] guess we listening to him where he was
[1:36:05] talking about how that uh Moses born
[1:36:09] with that great gift he said and
[1:36:11] everybody is born that
[1:36:16] way you said no no he's born CU he no
[1:36:20] okay go ahead
[1:36:21] see God created the soul of man perfect
[1:36:25] placed it within the body of that M baby
[1:36:29] at
[1:36:30] birth of the baby Satan begins to
[1:36:33] pervert the nature of that
[1:36:38] Soul he begins to pervert the nature of
[1:36:41] it he it's not that it's that it's just
[1:36:43] a
[1:36:44] nature he begins to pervert the nature
[1:36:47] of that Soul that's
[1:36:49] right the Soul's real
[1:36:56] amen Satan begins to pervert the nature
[1:36:59] of it see see the soul is the real you
[1:37:03] Satan begins to deal with that to
[1:37:06] pervert that now when we'll get on down
[1:37:07] here in a
[1:37:08] minute you'll see that's where God has
[1:37:10] to start at
[1:37:14] right God has to start from the soul
[1:37:19] amen all right see see Satan cannot
[1:37:22] create but he perverts the nature of
[1:37:26] it he gives you his
[1:37:29] nature in China they got a Chinese
[1:37:32] spirit in America they got an American
[1:37:33] Spirit where' that come from all them
[1:37:36] Devils that fell in the beginning
[1:37:39] right you see you mean I got only them
[1:37:41] devils in me not only them devils in you
[1:37:43] it's just the anointing from them right
[1:37:47] the nature of them
[1:37:50] y
[1:37:53] see he perverts then the nature of our
[1:37:56] soul and
[1:37:59] automatically the body will act like it
[1:38:03] right
[1:38:05] right because the spirit of the man see
[1:38:08] you say well there quotes where brother
[1:38:10] said souls and nature of spirit spirits
[1:38:12] and nature of Soul that's all that's
[1:38:14] well and
[1:38:16] good but is it just a nature of
[1:38:20] something
[1:38:22] if you're saying it's just the nature of
[1:38:23] a spirit then you got anointed ones and
[1:38:26] you got a problem with them because they
[1:38:27] got the genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:38:29] Ghost on their Spirit
[1:38:32] right right that don't make them
[1:38:35] Christians
[1:38:39] right we'll get back on this the next
[1:38:44] message somewhere in there we we'll get
[1:38:46] into
[1:38:50] it see the new birth then is the birth
[1:38:53] of the soul look what brother brother
[1:38:55] says on cruelty to sin number eight on
[1:38:57] your
[1:39:05] notes 1953
[1:39:09] 403 made him out of the Dust of the
[1:39:12] earth now not in his own image he had
[1:39:16] already made the man so you know what
[1:39:17] he's talking about and the man that he
[1:39:20] created was was made in image of animal
[1:39:22] right then he breathed into him the
[1:39:25] breath of life and he became a living
[1:39:27] Soul so the soul of man is the nature of
[1:39:30] the
[1:39:35] spirit now when you're
[1:39:38] reborn you don't get a new
[1:39:44] spirit well I thought I thought the
[1:39:47] Bible says we get a new
[1:39:50] spirit
[1:39:52] remember when he was dealing back there
[1:39:54] that this Spirit he say in his
[1:39:58] soul you get
[1:40:00] a you get a new nature of that Spirit
[1:40:07] right it's the same Spirit but a new
[1:40:11] nature of it
[1:40:13] right he said you take two then let them
[1:40:16] stand out there one a sinner one a
[1:40:17] Christian he said you can't tell the
[1:40:19] difference one of them is a different is
[1:40:22] a different his
[1:40:24] soul his nature is different he's been
[1:40:27] changed
[1:40:30] right exactly right Something's
[1:40:32] Happened now we get to it with Ezekiel
[1:40:35] where he says you get a new heart and a
[1:40:36] new spirit cuz that's a
[1:40:40] justification so look what he says on
[1:40:42] the law and Grace
[1:40:44] 54 he's talking about you know the
[1:40:47] animal's blood it couldn't change his
[1:40:48] heart cuz an animal life won't compare
[1:40:51] with human life the animal can't give
[1:40:53] the human
[1:40:54] blood see the animal can't do it because
[1:40:57] his life is a different life and an
[1:41:00] animal has a life but not a soul right
[1:41:03] an animal is a living being but not a
[1:41:05] soul right but God put soul on man now
[1:41:09] you think I'm reading it wrong but you
[1:41:11] read it see God put soul on
[1:41:13] man so then my soul what is the soul the
[1:41:17] nature of the spirit
[1:41:19] right
[1:41:21] so the nature of the spirit right but
[1:41:24] see you just make it a
[1:41:25] nature bird
[1:41:29] dog rabit
[1:41:31] dog you
[1:41:34] know it's a
[1:41:38] nature if it's a nature then why can't
[1:41:42] it work we just getting the nature
[1:41:44] changed we just read up there you don't
[1:41:48] get a new spirit why wouldn't it be you
[1:41:50] just get a new
[1:41:53] spirit why wouldn't that work same
[1:41:57] nature because you the same thing on the
[1:41:59] inside right you ain't done nothing to S
[1:42:02] right see thirsting for Life 1958
[1:42:08] 611 he's talking about the soul
[1:42:10] thirsting and coming on down said you
[1:42:11] know my soul thirst for thee if your
[1:42:14] soul is what directs you it's what makes
[1:42:18] you what you are a conversion is list a
[1:42:23] soul is the nature of the spirit and
[1:42:25] when a man is converted he doesn't get
[1:42:27] another
[1:42:29] Spirit he gets a spirit change listen a
[1:42:34] conversion means to change his thinking
[1:42:37] change his way of living and so forth so
[1:42:39] my soul thirst for thee see it's not a
[1:42:42] change like exchange right
[1:42:45] right there's a Doctrine in the message
[1:42:47] called change of the soul and this sex
[1:42:49] change and it it just won't
[1:42:51] work listen to what he says on the
[1:42:53] message token 1963 901 the morning
[1:42:58] service now there's a life a blood a
[1:43:01] life and a soul in the
[1:43:04] life now listen to what he
[1:43:07] say the soul is the nature of the
[1:43:12] life right now remember this is on act
[1:43:14] 63 so now he's got the soul is the
[1:43:16] center part of
[1:43:18] you therefore it had no certain
[1:43:24] nature it was an
[1:43:26] animal see an animal he has no certain
[1:43:29] nature about him he's an animal he's got
[1:43:31] the nature of the animal
[1:43:35] yeah this what is it what is that one
[1:43:39] me Abby what koala koala is the one that
[1:43:43] eat certain
[1:43:45] leaves it'll only eat
[1:43:47] eucalyptus see that's his nature yep
[1:43:52] what you can turn around and tell him
[1:43:53] say hey
[1:43:55] look over on that tree right beside of
[1:43:58] you is a beautiful
[1:44:01] fruit wonderful taste got a whole lot
[1:44:04] more vitamins and minerals and the K is
[1:44:07] giv his heating
[1:44:09] his he keep on his eucalyptus you can't
[1:44:12] change
[1:44:14] him but see you tell a
[1:44:17] human my wife used to tell me when we
[1:44:20] first got got married she'd cooked okra
[1:44:23] and she'd say honey it's
[1:44:25] good ain't no way I said I don't care
[1:44:29] nothing about
[1:44:30] it you know what she done she started
[1:44:32] putting cornmeal in it and onions and
[1:44:34] cutting it up and thing putting it
[1:44:36] together and I'd eat the
[1:44:38] cornmeal I found that it taste pretty
[1:44:41] good y now I love okra
[1:44:43] amen you know why cuz I got a soul in me
[1:44:46] that can make a decision
[1:44:49] right but now
[1:44:53] listen therefore the blood stood for a
[1:44:56] token that the life had been
[1:44:59] given but in this glorious place under
[1:45:02] this Covenant there's a difference
[1:45:04] between the blood and the
[1:45:07] life the token for the believer today is
[1:45:10] the Holy Ghost not a blood a chemistry
[1:45:13] but it's the holy spirit of God that is
[1:45:17] the token that God requires of the
[1:45:19] church today and God meets us we must
[1:45:21] have that now
[1:45:25] listen Satan as I
[1:45:28] said he perverts the nature of your soul
[1:45:32] exactly right those demons that fail
[1:45:36] they come down and we don't believe in
[1:45:38] them being like you know some of them
[1:45:39] taught it that they come down and
[1:45:41] inhabit man and and and you know they
[1:45:43] become superhuman men and they've done
[1:45:45] this that and the other and all the
[1:45:46] doctrines they had about it back there
[1:45:48] no the prophet said no I don't believe
[1:45:50] that
[1:45:51] coming down press themselves into human
[1:45:53] flesh he said no said they give you a
[1:45:54] nature
[1:45:58] right why because they pervert the
[1:46:00] nature of your soul the nature of that
[1:46:02] Soul had to be pure to start with right
[1:46:05] because it God could not create it imp
[1:46:06] created
[1:46:08] imperfect Satan perverts that
[1:46:11] nature we come down through
[1:46:14] life and there's not much said because
[1:46:17] God understands that's what I love about
[1:46:20] it
[1:46:22] he said there's not much reset about you
[1:46:24] until you reach the age of
[1:46:27] accountability you say well what is that
[1:46:29] brother Dale you can't determine that
[1:46:30] for every person cuz some people their
[1:46:33] mentality may be to the point that
[1:46:35] they're 50 years old before they ever
[1:46:37] reach the age of
[1:46:38] accountability but some kids May reach
[1:46:41] it earlier because of their
[1:46:42] accountability so it's how much they can
[1:46:46] understand and accountability and
[1:46:49] comprehension but somewhere in life you
[1:46:51] reach a a a time that's called the age
[1:46:53] of accountability right around said then
[1:46:56] a tape is made and put
[1:46:58] in not much before then why because
[1:47:01] you're under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:47:03] and all babies that are not reached the
[1:47:05] age of accountability that die you know
[1:47:08] before they reach the age of
[1:47:09] accountability all babies go to heaven
[1:47:11] amen I love that amen I always told you
[1:47:14] I used to wonder how God could tell them
[1:47:16] tell them people and children of is go
[1:47:18] out there and kill them amorites kill
[1:47:19] them every one men women children and
[1:47:21] all thought oh God why couldn't he go
[1:47:22] over and get just kill the men and women
[1:47:25] and just bring the babies home cuz I
[1:47:27] love babies you know why could he just
[1:47:30] bring them home with them you know and
[1:47:32] raise them up as Israelite babies you
[1:47:35] know you I said well Lord you know why
[1:47:38] why did you have them babies killed and
[1:47:40] one day he said he said I've done them a
[1:47:43] favor he said they' grown up they' have
[1:47:45] been big amorites and I'd have had to
[1:47:47] kill them send them to
[1:47:48] hell he said but that little amorites
[1:47:51] and he said all babies go to heaven I
[1:47:54] said Thank You
[1:47:55] Lord all babies that die for the age of
[1:47:58] accountability go to heaven no matter
[1:47:59] who they're born to Mom and Daddy's bad
[1:48:01] whatever it is brother said didn't have
[1:48:03] nothing to do with it but when you reach
[1:48:05] the age of
[1:48:06] accountability see don't blame nobody
[1:48:08] else for your perversion cuz when you
[1:48:10] reach the age of accountability you
[1:48:12] start accepting then what Satan has done
[1:48:15] right and how great it would have been
[1:48:17] for me as a young person and I remember
[1:48:20] that if I just listened to that being
[1:48:24] that I am I would have went out and done
[1:48:25] what I
[1:48:27] done you think about it you wouldn't
[1:48:29] have done
[1:48:31] it but instead I listen to The Devil in
[1:48:34] his ways my buddies and people
[1:48:39] around it perverted
[1:48:44] me so remember as I said now Satan
[1:48:47] perverts the nature of your soul
[1:48:51] he gives your soul a
[1:48:52] nature you soul is a
[1:48:56] nature
[1:48:58] well here's where your Prophet said it
[1:49:01] and I told a man up in Jeffersonville
[1:49:03] when he was talking about it and I said
[1:49:05] brother I
[1:49:06] said the nature of your soul is God if
[1:49:08] you're born again if not it's of the
[1:49:09] world he said how could a soul have a
[1:49:11] soul see all he knew was a nature Soul
[1:49:14] nature nature Soul that's all he
[1:49:17] knew I said you go talk to brother rown
[1:49:19] about I didn't say
[1:49:21] it you but I was going to argue with him
[1:49:24] about it I just said you go talk to
[1:49:26] brother brand but see Satan perverts
[1:49:29] your nature right amen makes us into a
[1:49:32] position to where that he is our King
[1:49:36] right now you said it when you got up
[1:49:39] old enough and I did too Saturday night
[1:49:42] came we didn't have no problems it was
[1:49:45] never a question are we going okay this
[1:49:50] said are we going to church
[1:49:53] tomorrow everybody understand why I said
[1:49:55] it that way there was never no doing
[1:49:57] that on the devil's side was it right
[1:50:01] you didn't say am I going out and follow
[1:50:04] the world
[1:50:05] tonight but now when it's serving God
[1:50:07] you well I don't know I I feel pretty
[1:50:11] bad well the church is a place to come
[1:50:14] where you feel bad amen
[1:50:16] right that's right you go away feel good
[1:50:19] right
[1:50:20] all right but you see Satan perverts the
[1:50:24] nature that's right of that
[1:50:26] Soul all right see that's why Jesus
[1:50:30] Christ had to
[1:50:31] come and watch it and study the study
[1:50:34] Matthew Mark Luke and John sometime just
[1:50:36] sit down and read them with this thought
[1:50:37] in mind and watch how the Lord Jesus
[1:50:41] would stand before them people and take
[1:50:44] the word he didn't have to discern them
[1:50:47] out I discern you got a bad spirit
[1:50:50] there not in the Bible that he said
[1:50:52] anything like
[1:50:54] that he just took the
[1:50:57] word and he started
[1:51:01] talking he never called them people
[1:51:06] Devils he said if you're that way your
[1:51:08] father your Devil's your father but he
[1:51:10] didn't call the father they had a deam
[1:51:13] choice he just started laying that word
[1:51:18] down and after a while looked at him and
[1:51:20] said you're talking about us he said Oh
[1:51:23] Glory you finally caught it I said I
[1:51:25] didn't do it I was talking about
[1:51:27] everybody Parables right
[1:51:31] right what was he
[1:51:33] doing let's see birth pain brother said
[1:51:37] it was hard to get those Pharisees to
[1:51:41] realize they were sinners now maybe
[1:51:43] Sadducees maybe religious something like
[1:51:45] but this is almost verba see it's hard
[1:51:47] to get them to realize they were Sinners
[1:51:49] we he could die
[1:51:53] for you know he didn't die for the
[1:51:55] righteous that's right is that according
[1:51:58] to the Bible right righteous don't need
[1:52:01] a
[1:52:02] savior he said it's hard to get them to
[1:52:04] realize they lost that's right so is it
[1:52:08] today folks hardest thing in the world
[1:52:11] to get the Believers of this message to
[1:52:13] realize they're lost right cuz he got
[1:52:15] all of the quotes always was
[1:52:18] eternal
[1:52:20] you can't get them to realize and search
[1:52:22] for God I told you about preaching that
[1:52:23] man's church that time and he said you
[1:52:25] got my people stirred up about seeking
[1:52:27] for God I said I'll never apologize for
[1:52:30] stirring the people up for seeking for
[1:52:32] God I'll apologize for preaching
[1:52:34] something in your church you didn't
[1:52:35] agree with but I will not apologize for
[1:52:38] trying to stir up people to get them to
[1:52:40] se go search for God that's
[1:52:42] right see because Satan begin now I know
[1:52:46] what brother R
[1:52:48] says he said said in the garden you know
[1:52:51] when the thing he said Satan took the
[1:52:53] head God took the heart now I know
[1:52:57] that so don't misunderstand Satan took
[1:53:00] the soul of mankind and perverted it
[1:53:03] amen that's right the nature of that
[1:53:06] Soul wound up perverted for his domain
[1:53:10] because that's what he started on right
[1:53:13] it was through the head you understand
[1:53:15] what the prophet said through the
[1:53:18] head
[1:53:20] through the memory reason conscience
[1:53:22] affections the see The Taste the feel
[1:53:25] the smell the
[1:53:26] hear and he begin to pervert God don't
[1:53:30] deal through seed taste feel smell and
[1:53:32] here he don't deal on memory reason
[1:53:34] conscious imagination
[1:53:36] affections he said oh yes no no he
[1:53:38] doesn't cuz he said brother BR said
[1:53:40] don't you go back there and try to talk
[1:53:42] them people into coming to the alar cuz
[1:53:44] he said you'll make them a two-fold
[1:53:46] child of hell you're dealing with their
[1:53:48] Spirit real or their body right he said
[1:53:51] don't do
[1:53:52] it you preach the gospel and let him
[1:53:55] come well I fail L of the lord well
[1:53:58] that's your choice you feel led of the
[1:54:00] Lord you do what God tells you to do but
[1:54:03] when this thing's over with you'll find
[1:54:04] out where that prophit was right or not
[1:54:07] you'll find out whether you led of the
[1:54:09] Lord that day or
[1:54:10] not he said Brother D I've never
[1:54:12] listened to anybody like you you never
[1:54:14] will probably well I'm in this world
[1:54:16] find anybody else as dumb as I am but I
[1:54:18] believe the gospel bless amen I believe
[1:54:21] in being born again
[1:54:23] amen and I went through that of people
[1:54:25] trying to get me into the
[1:54:28] altar it made me turn against coming to
[1:54:30] the
[1:54:32] altar amen now if it had been a real
[1:54:34] good
[1:54:36] person if brother Tatum let me say it
[1:54:38] that way if brother Tatum would have
[1:54:40] been there come back to me in the church
[1:54:43] and talk to me about God in his
[1:54:45] wonderful sweet way I would have walked
[1:54:47] with him to the altar
[1:54:50] but you know what I've told you before
[1:54:53] and they come and tried to tell me about
[1:54:54] Jesus Christ and come to church I said I
[1:54:56] live a better life you're a Deon
[1:54:58] board and I did and they couldn't argue
[1:55:01] the point brother R said it's the church
[1:55:05] that's right that's messed the whole
[1:55:06] thing up yep that's exactly right but
[1:55:09] watch now Satan begin at the soul to
[1:55:11] pervert the nature where does God
[1:55:16] begin he drops right down into that Soul
[1:55:19] he don't deal with your body and your
[1:55:22] spirit that's why there's so many
[1:55:23] religious people today they only to get
[1:55:25] it as far as their Spirit we'll get to
[1:55:26] that Sunday I got to hurry listen look
[1:55:29] at souls in prison preached in
[1:55:32] 1963 um 11:10 the morning service he
[1:55:35] said now this and he's talking about
[1:55:37] souls now in prison Souls that are now
[1:55:39] in prison now the soul of man is not the
[1:55:43] body of man it's the soul see and the
[1:55:47] soul is something that's the the nature
[1:55:50] of the
[1:55:51] spirit and then when the nature of a man
[1:55:54] when he said we are dead the scripture
[1:55:56] plainly tells us that we are dead and
[1:55:58] our lives are hidden and God through
[1:55:59] Christ still by there by the Holy Ghost
[1:56:02] now it wasn't that your body died now
[1:56:04] he's talking about the new birth right
[1:56:06] right you talking about salvation
[1:56:10] now it wasn't your body died it wasn't
[1:56:13] your spirit
[1:56:16] died it was the nature of the your
[1:56:20] spirit died amen
[1:56:22] see the nature which is the soul amen
[1:56:25] now watch it the nature of your soul is
[1:56:30] is
[1:56:31] God if you're born again amen if it's
[1:56:36] not it's of the world
[1:56:38] right so the nature of our soul is of
[1:56:42] God if we're born again right if not
[1:56:44] it's the nature of the world
[1:56:48] Amen it's not just Souls the nature the
[1:56:53] spirit go right on down reading because
[1:56:55] of
[1:56:57] continuation when so when you see this
[1:57:00] man walking down the street thinking
[1:57:01] he's somebody you know and got a little
[1:57:03] education and things you're you remember
[1:57:06] it's a clot of Indiana dust that's all
[1:57:09] and that woman that's all dressed in
[1:57:11] shorts and smoking cigarettes and
[1:57:12] carrying on down the street twisting
[1:57:14] like she owned the whole country it's a
[1:57:17] clot of Indiana dust and that that's the
[1:57:19] way it's turning back so you're not very
[1:57:22] much to begin with see so that that's
[1:57:25] right that's what you
[1:57:27] are but that Soul that's in Dy that soul
[1:57:33] is where is that soul is what God's
[1:57:36] working
[1:57:38] on he's not working on your body he's
[1:57:40] not working on your
[1:57:41] spirit watching see if he can only get
[1:57:45] that nature of that Spirit to agree with
[1:57:48] him
[1:57:50] then the nature
[1:57:51] dies
[1:57:53] amen the nature and the love of the
[1:57:55] world dies and the things of the world
[1:57:57] is dead see because you love the world
[1:58:01] or the things of the world the love of
[1:58:03] God is not in you and when and a man
[1:58:06] must be born again so this Nature has to
[1:58:09] die and the nature of God comes and
[1:58:11] lives in you and God is the only thing
[1:58:14] there is that never did begin or never
[1:58:17] can End Amen right now it can give this
[1:58:19] one but it's continuation of the reading
[1:58:22] same message so therefore he has
[1:58:25] partnershi you and taken this man
[1:58:28] Earthly and this eternal spirit and put
[1:58:31] it together because God reflected
[1:58:34] himself back in in that he became a man
[1:58:38] when he became Christ Jesus and he was
[1:58:41] God see God was in Christ lived in him
[1:58:43] reconciled the world to himself and
[1:58:45] through that perfect man each one of us
[1:58:48] imperfect that believe in God and has
[1:58:51] accepted that becomes a Perfection of
[1:58:54] him
[1:58:56] amen so what's he working on God begins
[1:58:59] to work on your
[1:59:01] soul to change the nature of
[1:59:05] it why because it had a nature of the
[1:59:10] world so what is the new
[1:59:15] birth what is the new birth it's the
[1:59:17] birth of the Soul
[1:59:20] not the birth of the body not the birth
[1:59:21] of the spirit it's the birth of the
[1:59:24] Soul that's why I don't try to get
[1:59:27] people
[1:59:28] to and I know people don't like his
[1:59:30] statements but I don't try to get them
[1:59:32] to come to
[1:59:33] church brother R said I don't believe
[1:59:35] we're getting them to Christ we're just
[1:59:37] getting them to church right
[1:59:40] right now do you misunderstand that
[1:59:42] that's you got a problem because I
[1:59:45] invite people to church yeah but I'm not
[1:59:48] trying to get nobody body from anywhere
[1:59:50] to come to this
[1:59:55] church you I always just tell everybody
[1:59:57] and you know it's probably been told to
[1:59:58] you I said if you come to the church
[2:00:01] just because you want to come to church
[2:00:03] you'll be a hindrance to me and I'll be
[2:00:04] a hindrance to you right but if you want
[2:00:07] to come and seek God and try to find the
[2:00:09] word then we're here right all right we
[2:00:12] walk on in God and try to to make this
[2:00:15] thing and come out of it in the right
[2:00:16] manifestation right cuz I believe in the
[2:00:18] birth of the word right cuz he got to
[2:00:22] plant that word and we'll get to it
[2:00:24] Sunday then when planting that word
[2:00:26] according to read future home between
[2:00:28] now and Sunday or listen to the message
[2:00:30] pay close attention about page 14 15 16
[2:00:34] 17 and you'll see what he explaining
[2:00:36] then you burth
[2:00:39] right that unclean Spirit has to be
[2:00:41] driven
[2:00:44] out before God can come
[2:00:47] in y that unclean spirit is the devil's
[2:00:52] nature that was given to our soul by
[2:00:55] perversion God begins on that soul to
[2:00:58] try to plant that seed of the word right
[2:01:01] to drive that unclean Spirit
[2:01:03] out but just because it's driven out
[2:01:06] doesn't mean you're
[2:01:11] saved you re future
[2:01:13] home just because that unclean Spirit
[2:01:16] goes out the Bible says be careful
[2:01:18] because he'll come back in the state of
[2:01:20] the person be seven times worse
[2:01:24] amen the new birth is a birth of the
[2:01:26] Soul amen amen to try to bring God's
[2:01:30] nature that's it right there into our
[2:01:34] being
[2:01:37] amen not into our body not into our
[2:01:39] spirit bring it into the soul the body
[2:01:42] and spirit will follow the soul
[2:01:45] amen the battle that people have is they
[2:01:48] try to become Christians in spirit realm
[2:01:50] and then they have troubles why because
[2:01:52] the flesh is a problem yielding one way
[2:01:55] and God is trying to gring them another
[2:01:56] way and they just a constant
[2:02:00] battle you see Jesus Christ had to give
[2:02:04] his
[2:02:05] life he had to give his soul a ransom
[2:02:09] that's right not just an anointing of a
[2:02:12] spirit right he had to give his soul a
[2:02:16] ransom for you and I
[2:02:21] and if that wasn't the soul of God we
[2:02:24] are lost amen
[2:02:27] amen that's right but if that was the
[2:02:29] soul of almighty God then we have a
[2:02:32] hopes of eternal life that's right come
[2:02:35] on think on these things that's
[2:02:39] right think on these things are you born
[2:02:43] again what do you mean brother Dale I've
[2:02:45] got all of the signs in I didn't ask you
[2:02:48] that
[2:02:50] right Paul run into people there that
[2:02:52] were really great people and he said if
[2:02:54] you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:56] since you believe that's
[2:03:00] right they were proven and that the one
[2:03:03] a poish them that was appren that Jesus
[2:03:06] was the Christ by the scriptures
[2:03:09] right amen sure
[2:03:12] was but he said you need to be born
[2:03:15] again amen that's right what about it
[2:03:20] yes but brother Dale I can't deny
[2:03:22] because if I deny him he'll deny
[2:03:27] me good old Baptist
[2:03:31] Doctrine not much salvation in it but a
[2:03:33] good old Baptist
[2:03:35] Doctrine if you was ever there you'd
[2:03:37] know what I'm saiding is the truth cuz
[2:03:39] they'll
[2:03:40] say I've got to believe I've Got to
[2:03:43] Believe In The Father Son and Holy Ghost
[2:03:45] cuz if I don't believe in the father Son
[2:03:47] and Holy Ghost the Bible says I'm lost
[2:03:49] yeah well I do too I Believe In Father
[2:03:51] Son Holy Ghost amen I just don't believe
