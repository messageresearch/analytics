God bless you I guess that's her husband I just talked today so you could call you to write God bless you God bless praise the Lord I'm so glad to be here uh I brought greetings from my wife sister Vivian from Nigeria I've only been married once in my life and and I'm not planning for another one either we don't believe in that nonsense praise the Lord there are all kind of things flying around and your brother told me when I was here many years ago say no brother Tony got a wife in America I said that's allow the devil now you know he's lying to you we don't my father was married to 10 wives he's the chief he's the high chief of the tribe he could do that if under my 5 16 what I've been back there but the Lord brought me to this right here and I ain't going nowhere brother you know I'm home to stay I thank Lord Jesus this hour for sending us a prophet amen he did not send us just a prophet he said not the mighty prophet and I've been pastoring now for the past 30 years the past three decades and the message of the hour I came to the Christian church I mean in 1968 over 45 years ago and I remember the Reverend father the first church I first went towards the Roman Catholic church and uh they I was from my school and the Reverend father was from Europe and and he one day you know those those preachers of those days even though they're in organizations there's something about them they have some spiritual gifts in their lives they don't have the giver but the parents about they have the gifts and the man looked at me I didn't know I was going to be a preacher because I don't like to be a creature I used to laugh at preachers or even Christians those days I never know I was going to be one myself you know but the man look at me said um would you like to be a priest I said uh yes sir I said but you're gonna have to talk to Daddy you're gonna have to talk to Chief and let him give you the uh they go ahead but I know you can never do that I can never go for my dad to ask him for permission my dad's not asking what's wrong with you who are you you know but um I thank Lord Jesus that doubt with that God said a foundation for me and little by little and from the Roman Catholic Church I went to Penn different Pentecostal organizations and things until one day one day yeah I said one day I heard the voice of Jehovah Eagle God the mother eagle and coming to come up out of those champagne and I appreciate the goodness alone thank Lord for Pastor Dale uh some years ago I would do some art teaching uh what do you call that Atlanta Georgia God bless him coming over there with the church and my brother brother um her brother here about her brother brother Collins God bless my brother came over there help us move stuff and things it's such a blessing to be with God's people I tell you there's no other group like this bread of Jesus Christ we are a special class of people sometimes people compare themselves with denominations I said don't you that's an insult you don't ever compare the bread of Christ with the Oneness Holiness Assemblies of God there but but as a matter of fact they are not even ashamed of God they are Assemblies of the devil God to assemble with God is to assemble with this word you have to be in the light of your day to assemble with him says the evidence of the Holy Ghost is all about and I really appreciate the Lord Jesus for the goodness of God in the ministry of this church and the puppet is not a place to joke or to try to flatter because Paul said that the spirit said we should name my brethren be not ye teachers of many things knowing that we're going to receive the greatest damnation we don't come here to just run our mouth people don't understand the job of a Preacher is a very dangerous one you know it's not an easy one to about appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ for the past of this church brother Samuel Dale so all the years I have known him I remember when I used to come to Georgia those years ago when I come to Georgia I only came to two people two pastors to preach for pastor Samuel Dell and brother old brother Wilson hambre then Covington Georgia those he asked you know before his wife after I just before his wife passed away or something and you know and since then but the deal has no change he has no move he still right with this world and that's what I thank God for you know hallelujah praise the Lord amen people there are a lot of things flying around today I told some bread and I said there and I hate to say that but I'm going to say the truth you know I I don't fear any man I only fear him right you know I only I respect man I don't fear any man we're not supposed to fear men the Bible said to fear the lord Jesus and and and and and there are some so many churches in the message today in North America that even if we are offered you know one million dollars for the deal We're not gonna go there because they of what they are doing or what they have done with this message of the hour in Africa we don't have the sister who tell your brother will tell you back there we don't have Medicare we don't have Medicaid we don't have I mean medical insurance all those stuff we don't have all those Richards Richard but when this one came to us right that's all we needed right there that's our Medicare that's our Medicare that's our you know you know Blessed assurance Jesus my Hallelujah and when once we got this message he ain't going no we got it you're not going to go anywhere right and for anybody to come and play with it this you know he's playing lives we're not going to let them we don't we're not going to play around and we'll not go around those two brothers whenever you see a man leave the word he say you leave that man alone I appreciate the Lord and they pass to pass past pastors I mean they may have some great time with him and sister Dale may God bless him please put your hands together so much you know you know we have heard that quote so many times brother answer whenever a man is called to the ministry if he's married his wife is called also you just don't understand the pressure that goes with this ministry I may Pastor all these years and I can tell you exactly the attempts that come from home to the church and I feel so happy singing dancing and driving comes to church and I do when I leave the church in the evening I'll be so sad that somebody didn't hurt my feelings in the church I said oh Lord God what did I do now you know that's how the past reminisce result is you know it's it's just the grace of God right but the branches The Minister's job is the most difficult in the world may God bless with the deal appreciate but the Wade God bless my dear friend put it together for my brother here please somebody I'll put you thank God for the word amen every time we see several attorneys smiling you know you just don't know what it is but Abraham says America sends money in domestic War has that what what has that Elijah he said America send money to all the world financial aids to all the world countries of the world to make friends they say and that's not those countries get back on their feet by their feet feet they turn their back around in America against America but the rest of you say see you can buy friendship with money that's right he said true friendship is a gift from God and I thank God today for good friends that Jesus said here are my friends and we are friends and that God brought us together we don't know anybody no no we don't know each other in this life but we've been together in his mind right before the foundation of the world so at the time the Lord for for them there's many things flying around the world today in the message of the hour we discuss many of them a lot of them yesterday and Pastor Dale and things and and it's just sad there's so many of their brothers that we started this race together if in fact those who have started risk for us those that should have known better those that you think will stay here they are all they mean they mean they're not missing for so many years they should be the pillar in the church but it won't going back by sliding today that's sad isn't it that's very sad because actually you know I believe a True Believer is like the wine the longer it's in the bottle the stronger it becomes yeah I mean these people uh they've been around for them in the message for so long a time and they just go back that's very sad now I thank love for wayfaring men who are present the battle and I may the Lord bless you today um I want to I want to I want to read a few things here before I preach my message God help me today I I'm not I've never preached here on Wednesday night brother they'll always bringing bring me in on weekends so we have time to preach in the morning go downstairs and downstairs and eat some food no we don't eat food for here the sister is laughing we we go down there and eat some of the your American food you know that's what I like about America you know yesterday but the Dale took me to rise remember the deal brother Wayne and I appreciate his precious wife there somebody give her a hand somebody flick on the plates God bless sister Mr wait praise the Lord and sister Hannah right and back there we had a good time yesterday and her husband I tell you I enjoy the family but you know go downstairs after the morning service and eat some of the food yesterday at Ryan's they took me to the buffet I got all kind of food all over the place oh my God this all look good they might they might say they are hybrid but they smell good it tastes good too oh we thank God for his goodness but before us we sing it we sing a song with Jesus had a table spread where the saints of God are fed he invites his chosen people come and die and with his manner he don't Feed and Supply our every needs oh it's sweet to serve with Jesus all the time I'm so glad there's not no other place that's so sweet to be like at the table of the Lord that's why we receive strength receive healing receive encouragement and eternal life above all hallelujah amen so but the brand was when was was running of his ministry he taught the climax of the ministry he he said we are so grateful for the Gospel Light just imagine what this world will be or look like without this Gospel Light and when I said the gospel like I mean those there's only one gospel I'm not about the denomination forget about them shut them out I'm talking about the gospel the good news that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah we thank the Lord for it but I'm still one thing about it is that Italian law that when the law sent him out there to preach the gospel this the gospel he has he did not play with the gospel but because the angel wrote all of the Lord told him in his Commission in the cave he said thou can be sincere and that's what's lacking today among the preachers if thou can be sincere and get people to believe you he said nothing shall stand before your prayers not even cancer this ministry requires a lot of a lot of sincerity you know and you know you but the Branson you must never try to deceive the ears of the people right and so but Abraham was saying that he hasn't he's not in our class he has never deceived the hears of the people and they came when they say we thank God for this Gospel Light and he said and and he said I'm like I feel like Jesus he said Jesus said to those those disciples before he left the Earth then he said what I hear I speak I have not hidden anything from you all that the father showed me I give to surely to you and brother Brown said and I also remember Apostle Paul when he was speaking in acts in 20 verse 27 when Paul said to those Elders that I have not shown to declare unto you the whole counsel of God and but the man said I may I join in the message Look Away to Jesus said may I join in tonight and say the same thing with that great sense of old he said to the best of my knowledge I have not not shunned but declared to you the whole counsel of God and that's exactly that's what William did he did not hold back anything from the bride because it is not his message it is his message and then he did not hold back anything and those of us who are old timers here but they were telling me that we have a couple five six brothers here Believers here who are actually witnessed by the Browns Ministry you all that are there may God bless you we weren't there but we read about the message I thank God for the message but I also thank God for the spirit of the message because you can say people said they believed the message but they don't have the spirit of the message so therefore they were stuck in their intellectual mind they try to figure out what Ram was saying that's why they're all messed up but if you have the spirit of the message you have the Holy Ghost the spirit of Revelation that makes Jesus realer to realize English say make Jesus realer to you amen and and during Brothers Ministry we know his ministry is a very unique Ministry it's not the kind of riffraff or all kind of preachers past but now it's just a preacher or a pastor but Abraham was a prophet if the prophet and and we we remember how that his ministry uh was in three phases 333 polls and we know the Frozen second polls what now for us the first example is for the campaign it's just an attraction together the crowd and we remember the first pool was the sign in the hands whereby it can with this left hand it can hold their your right hand and then his head on the tip of his fingers to his elbow which in color whether to blue or purple to tell the kind of disease the person has I said sir you're a shadow you have a cancer or something like that and then the angel Allah by the answer come to pass that you also know the intents of the hearts of man but when I said that happened the first time when he was in Florida or something that was able to disarm it was the hearts and things tell them what to do many years back and everything and what they need to do to get straightened up and things and then we also remember that I'm so enthused and so excited he began to you know explain those give those four two gifts and even even the brothers who are even the mess they were following him then uh every time Advanced is going to to to to to to to to to to hunt they say oh brother then right now we go with you we're gonna go with you but actually the them brothers are not actually going to hunt they were going there to use the gift and when they got to the to the woods huh they would live put their leave their gun down there on the floor on the ground and go to talk about that brand they know because that's not they start talking about the Branham the vision will break up even to see visions and things like that even though they know about the brown said every time it goes to to hunt he's just going there to rest a little bit and you know but see he explained the first and the second pole of his ministry and there are all and there are all kind of impersonation that came out of that uh and to the point that the union of law said that he's trying to teach Pentecostal babes Supernatural things so you can do that you know and then we remember our various preachers like A.A Allen like even though our robots remember foreign Kansas City remember my brother or a robot Apple Branham he said that you think God can answer my prayers like this but Abraham says sure do you answer anybody's prayer and our Robert said well here I go and they might went in the ministry and started became a big old uh big Prosperity preacher or whatever more and different ones that also follow him after that the voice of healing erita God only see how many of them and those guys they used they impersonated the first the first two polls and what they do to pull crowd for themselves they did not pull crowd to Jesus they tried to use William Brown's Ministries to make themselves big shots I was in Canada sometimes last year and I heard but the day I heard about uh about arm Bast Baxter quote by the Rams campaign manager for a while he was pastored in Canada and after I left this church and then followed by the ram to be his manager for a while and after a while I believe in California one time saying I'm going back to my church my church is looking for but actually when he left that time it's not because you want to leave he was going to have his own outfit set up now it was no longer last year somebody was telling me that Ambassador has a bible school then in Canada and he even denied all the supernatural things that he saw on the William Brothers Ministry you see what we're talking about these are people that saw the stood to sat there and they watched the supernatural took place in William Brown Ministry and they are denied today sister Salah it does is not something that's that's that's that's that's sad but after the angel of Lord told me the Brahman he said the third pool cannot be impersonated and you know and and but the man said I'm pouring my heart to you through the opening of the world he said because if the spirit of Christ if the love of Christ in me I cannot you know give the love of Christ to you if I have the spirit of beetle of Beethoven I must sing like Beethoven if I have the spirit of Shakespeare I write poems and write dramas like like Shakespeare and he said and if Christ lives in me he said the worst of Christ I'll do so right it's got to be and he said and what is Christ he said the word he said if he abide in me and my wording you then ask what you will it will be done because the word is there see it just need the light to Quicken it you know and the light makes it leave he said so now you say I'm gonna say something to you now that I have not said Allah all along and that is the thing that we've I've looked forward to for so long for at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pool has not been Vindicated I want to put my keyword to use the word Vindicated as my keyword there because I know these are 10 places three after the opening of seven zeros when I see going until now God is still vindicating the third person now because the blood of Jesus Christ is sort of play and use the major part of the Tuple number the plan right amen so and they said that now remember there will never be an impersonation of that because it cannot be see it cannot be it can now it's in existence he said right at this time now it's just happened why everyone was preaching remember when I was preaching at seventh seal uh with the Sunday with the pastor today I believe but the brother was three on seven seal and there was no way but around we'll talk about the seventh seventh seal without talking about himself because that is his seal that is the bright seal so there is just now possible for him to talk about about 70 without himself and Angela said stop right there it is in the summer so if you remember in seals so don't know about it and here in this message Look Away to Jesus he started to talk about his third pull again and then you can say stop number runs it just happened right now he said I should stop you know and why he said so he said he asked me to stop right now so it could identify it's identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a greater way until this Council begins to tighten up and when it does so when that does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything right right then why are you surprised by Ben Hina Benny Hinn having Crusade and heal him campaign and everything because that's what runs are going to happen after the open of the world when this when we're getting close to this to the squeeze the Pentecostal were built impersonate almost anything you know and it's happening already right now he said but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down there you will see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of his power and he said see c c c four times that's emphasis praise the Lord he said everyone knows that for as certain as the frost at Frost was identified for the two so has the second been identified and if you will think real closely you who are spiritual as the Bible said here is to him that has wisdom he said the third is properly identified see we know where it is so the topic will say what is the Tuple the purple is the opening of the word the fullness of the world we call it the seven Thunders these Seven Seals got the seven thunders at the Revelation containing the seven zeros what is it the surround climax of William Brampton Ministry the evening Shadow remember this evening Shadow remember the evening light the review word that's the third pool praise the Lord and so when the Bible said it is so sacred for three it is so sacred that I mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said he said this say nothing of it so you remember that years ago they say amen he said it speaks for itself the word the fullness of the word speaks for assembly Richard he said see but two he said I've tried to explain the others and I made a mistake said but this the purple the fullness of the word will be the thing that to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away see the turtle the opening of the word and that's why I told you I said no wonder Satan has been so much against this message at this stage because it is no longer the gifts anymore there's nobody campaign anymore it's the truth the fullness of the word and Satan doesn't like the truth he hears the truth yes exactly right he said now talk about this quiz he said then let's come this quiz the next we are waiting for right now is this quiz but this quiz has to come before the Rapture before the body change and but the man said in uh in in inverse paragraph 44 of them as I said now I must lay acquired for just a while and he did it's been Restless since then right in glory paragraph 45 he said there is coming a time talking about this quiz there is coming a Time upon in this nation America is talking about here in America this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before it that's Rome that this nation will do that brothers and sisters you say America cannot do it you're gonna do it we see what America did near Iraq because she had the military power she has shown that she can do it she brought it in 1992 during the Gulf War America has enough power and influence to bring the Allied Nations together and nobody resisted him her she had the power to do that praise the Lord and recently the war in Iraq and Afghanistan America has shown the world what he she can do praise the Lord but it's not going to stop there because she also had a religious power also remember she came up in Revelation 13 like a lamb which is a religious power and but the man said well Euro revision 13 He said now and the dragon is Rome always so don't you see see Roman denomination paragraph 47 a mark Protestant denomination and image unto the beast making the power that will force all Protestants right like into like a union you see you will have to be into this castle of churches or you won't be able to have Fellowship I told people with Nigeria even in Florida during the convention last weekend I said people those of you like to run away from church when they shot the doors of our church you don't have to worry them no more right because you ain't going to have no church to go to them but right now the pastor is begging is preaching the preachers are begging and say please come to church come to church see Paul the Bible says not to forsake the garden of one another as a manner of some but Abraham said you see those some are unbelievers because Believers go to church God goes to church but around certainly man and that may say as an eagle start our next he said before we come to church he said the angel of Lord are here for us to prepare the service before we got here that's why them demons don't have a chance and after this and they make sure that the service go through the song service went through successfully and the preaching goes through successfully and then at the end of the service God detail one Angel each to each of us to follow up oh Hallelujah just imagine security of the angels I haven't started preaching here maybe I wouldn't preach now just help me Lord you know and God will send each of us with an Angel you know talk about the CIA or FBI from Heaven follow me to protect me hallelujah amen and to is that to keep you and to watch over you and to keep you safe that's how powerful it is so that's why we come to church but see they said they will close our church and would not be able to have Fellowship anymore but all this Pokemon would have been eaten on you know he said hit the book right we've been eating on this what's wrong word that's when they will come to effect in our life and the third pool will take effect the world will become flesh like we have never seen before before then you know we are close to the body change well see they will close the churches down uh it's practically that way now that's as a December 29 1963. he said it's practically that way now but Odell he said uh you can go to a church and preach then unless you have a fellowship card or some identification you see you see and now on Persons like us Mercy believers we are going to be caught out of all that all together we will not be part of that Union of churches right and that's exactly he said because they won't be able to do it why because the power of the thoughtful in us will hold us up it's a stabilizer but everybody say our stabilizer holds in the word it is not you holding him it's him holding us you won't be able to do that they will put pressure on us you know and they will get the sweetness of God out of us for that you know when you buy you buy an orange nice good wrapping orange you don't get the taste of it until you squeeze it right and this bride will be squeezed by these churches and they will see the power of God out of our Lives you know that we shouldn't go in the Rapture Hallelujah but if I said now it's tightening up now you start me now it's starting now yes they are starting now now they they know who you are don't think they don't know who you are they know you they have your ID they have it on internet they know where you live they know where you work they know how much you make right they do remember that boy is nodding that just exposed the NSA his name is in Russia right now you know trying to get some Asylum somewhere but you know what they're not the government it's not just spying on the people but the way they've been doing it for so many years so they know what every time you make your phone call they listen in every time Hallelujah so they know what's going on so when the time comes they know those they know where you live so that's why we're saying we better get the Holy Ghost now we feel the Holy Spirit right in the fire of God now be still into the body of Christ right now because before because tomorrow might be too late he said so he said so therefore he said that and I standing up now and then when that time comes and the Press comes to a place to where you are pressed out he said then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then see and it will be absolutely to the total loss but to be for the bride and the church so now we are closer than it seem to be say I don't know when but it's real real close and I said today in Gainesville Georgia 2013 is real real close events being made clear by prophecy there's no hope in this world anymore there's no no there's no hope anymore the government don't know what to do anymore they have no solution to life trouble this world will not know peace on the Prince of Peace returns to the Earth again Hallelujah so now we are really close then it seems to be I don't know when but it's real real close I may be building a platform for somebody else to step on I will be taken before that time I wish he was I don't know and I finally said and I want to say this I've never said it before but according to scripture according to what he said 33 years ago 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in Ohio uh 1933 rather what he said everything has happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world and he's doing it right now it doesn't matter how many scoffers we have the message right now because right now we're having people denying this message proclaiming all kind of nonsense against William Branham they claim that a mystery the cloud was not real they step around made some mistakes I don't who care about his mistake I already got in my message that was sent to me I don't care about no mistake if you come even to a local assembly if you come here to look for Mystic you're going to see plenty here are you following me but at the same time you come to see Jesus you're going to see the Lord here because it's right here you say we're about two or three I got that in my name there I will be in their means and if people come to this message to look for thought because he plenty of mistakes too you know but if they come to see Jehovah and Murphy Christ in his bride they will see it also bless me I ain't here to look for no missing this message I'm here to see Jesus Christ and I've seen already I ain't going nowhere anymore are you following me so he said uh um so they have about I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world for as John the Baptist was sent to foreign coming and John said behold the land of Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world see so it is parallel it parallel in every way and I know it will and he said this message will go on this message will go on brother I don't care who is against it I don't care who is trying to run it down I've been I've been passing this message now for 30 30 years ain't gonna tell me to turn back I ain't turning back going nowhere I will invested so much time so much energy so much money I have convention every year preach on the radio do outside crusade to win soul I attempt to go back man I'm gonna tell that guy he's crazy he lost his man I ain't going nowhere man I'm home to stay when I get to this message brother Carly I quit shopping Hallelujah Blessed Be His holy name praise the Lord if you have a Bibles tonight let's switch together just bear with me Brothers I I don't

said no tell me when to stop bless him here let's pull him for my me like that teach me like that bless you I love her that way amen let's bow our heads today together Sins Of God Heavenly Father Lord just like your precious Prophet said no doubt any man that could read or write can pick up this bible to read from there but it takes the great Holy Spirit to give the Revelation behind the lines we are asking tonight Lord that you come to us Lord in the beauty of thy power and holiness and speak to us through the spoken word forgive Allah as soon as trespasses to their father peel the skin sick and The Afflicted as it's written written that you sent your word and it healed them let healing virtue flow tonight it's pretty sure healing the soul and physical feeling for the healings for the body Lord at the end of all things tonight may we glorify that in the holy name in Jesus Christ's name we prayed amen Exodus the first chapters the third chapter verses one to six now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priests of median and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him watch in the flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and it said draw not neither put off thy shoes from all thy feet for the place we are on thousandest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God may the Lord bless the reading of his holy word we may be seated this this evening tonight I want to speak to you Sins Of God for next few minutes on this subject of the pillar of Fire blessed be the name of the Lord I I was reading um uh quotes right there while I was in the office there but Brown was talking the message exhortation of Divine Healing in 1951 May the the first and was praying during the prayer line they said and father my desire is tonight personally that you will magnify yourself before the people in this day to let them know that your spirit your spirit that your word that your promise oh master your promise it is written the scripture that you heal the people that might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet you did these things that it might be fulfilled and oh Lord God Of Heaven these things we do tonight that might be fulfilled which was spoken by our Master these things that I do he said shall you also so he knew the house of the people he knew what was wrong with them and the spirit is here Brothers here how many believe that night spirit is here tonight he healed the people and father this is tonight to fulfill which was said by our Master going into all the world and preach the gospel lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you see and Grant Lord that you will send tonight your Great Divine Angel somebody say Amen tonight your Great Divine Angel your healing spirit maybe it's the same angel that was on the pull of Bethesda we do not know I do not know him father in that way his name maybe it's the same angel that followed the children of Israel that led them rather in the sign of a pillar of fire maybe it does a simpler fire that we are looking at right now tonight in this church maybe he's here tonight here no maybe he's here tonight Hallelujah and and I thought that he will be and will show great science and wonders I mean the outcome is tearing among the people quickly for we realize Lord that we just have a few days to be here right now that's done with the absolute truth we have much time to stay in this world we are nearing home we are closer to home people I was we went to the church to the to the hospital today with the pastor and we pray for the George George Canada and we press it I would say brother will soon going to be home we are nearly home we are almost home brother you know and then the devil have no power or control over this pleasure anymore we'll be living in perfect Perfection I look at him on the bed tonight and I saw my and the pastor didn't know it but while he step out to take care of something with the daughter how did she has just rolled on my from my eyes I said this is Brother Canada the last time I saw him I was in his house I have just preached for about the Dale I preached for the Dale here morning and evening I remember the brothers Andrew head and uh Joseph Canada took me to their daddy in the house and I held his hand in his house and we prayed and that building shook but the Lander would tell it the anointing came down so smiling his house and that was the last time I saw him and today when I saw him was on the bed he can't even talk back to me you see he shows that here we have no continuing City people and I believe that sometimes we need to remind ourselves for that purpose remind ourselves of the the about the things about this common salvation that we share that we share this conservation that brought us together in this evening light at this crucial hour and when I first came to the United States many years ago people of God I remember that there was a lot of Fellowship in America I remember remember those days we traveled to different meetings brothers having meetings conventional over the United States in Canada and it just seems that right now that it's not like that no more it's like everybody is now on to himself and and it wasn't that this preachers but Richard they just can't instead of working for the master each of them is trying to build a kingdom for themselves and I tell that's very sad isn't it we are not called to come and build the kingdom for ourselves we are servants we are on what is servants it's not even our message it is his message and that should make us even fear how we relate with this message how we handle this message we should handle this message with fear and trembling not to play with this message but also when Israel came to Goshen when the angel of death was going through that night said they are not there to discuss the message they were there to apply the token the end time message applies the token which means you can never receive the genuine but it's not Holy Ghost answer that this message you have but Abraham said also said in seven Church ages book he said total obedience to the word of God and that was the believer to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's the turbulent action right there you know and and and I'm so sad that today is not no no no no it's not like that anymore and the different preachers saying all kind of stuff and and even short members too they are taking over from them he didn't install the people he started the preachers but you know because you hear the Bible but the Collins grandson was claiming that kind of stuff against him saying that but after 36 years in the message he will was born and raised the message by his Granddaddy and that boy I went on the website in Florida and my heart just bled within me to see what that boy put on the internet openly to the world took interview in the television stations to denounce William Branham to say the Bible was forced but Abraham did not they are the the mystery Club was not genuine all kind of nurse and Mary Mary Rose prophecy was not genuine I said what is wrong with this boy you see but see their problem started with the preachers but the Bible says but in any people it's the leaders of the people he said in every age it's like that it's not the people see see people the preachers yeah that's why I said you are blessing against Georgia you might not understand but I know what I'm talking about because in some Churches of the message they don't care about the Holy Ghost no more all anything goes there brother and today I've been in denomination over this all the many years of fighting the message and all my years in the nomination I never witnessed a minister in organization come before for me and tell lies to my face but I've seen that this message people I've seen preachers in the message tell lies for the richest to my face I said brother I totally preacher one time South Carolina I said brother you said that I said brother put your hand in this Bible and look at me straight in the eyes and someone just told me it's true and just said well he said that's just a book I said what that's the Bible brother that's the Word of Life brother oh mercy God have mercy on this preachers but that's what is going on today we we cannot believe this message and I I see what I'm saying people are changing every day the churches are changing a problem with the statement here in the in the unchanging God he said but we find out that the churches change they are changing thoroughly my father used to say when he was alive he said you know if you have a friend that you have not seen like about a year a good friend of yours see next time you see him you got to be very careful you better watch out because since the last time you saw him you don't know what he has turned to yeah you don't know where he's been hanging around so you better watch out and try to study what is it what it is right now because he may not be the guy you used to know before and that's the same with the churches today and with the preachers today when you see them few years and simply next time he better watch out that be careful now you know what they are believing now you don't know what they are preaching now you know you have to you know be on guard and everything you know he said but we found out that churches change and the people changes Road changes yeah I see all kind of construction America going on he said that the same changes even even the politics changes politics changes too whoever thought that a black man will be in the white house today as a president of America that's not gonna happen if black man in the White House how is he gonna die who's gonna put him there how's it going to get there but today we shall have one day Obama I ain't no politician people I'm a Christian now I don't vote for nobody you know I only casted one vote and that's for the Lord Jesus Christ and that say I'm done are you following me but politics have changed I know it's very hard for the for the Republicans to to swallow it but they cannot change it because polities have changed and the same thing people have changed churches have changed but it runs about there's one thing that does not change and that is God Hallelujah he said he Remains the Same he said I am God and I change not so no matter how long it is that God has never changed one bit and it cannot change he said what a place he said the reason he cannot change is because God is infinite and anything that is infinite can not change Hallelujah and guess what the good part of it is that when we receive the Holy Ghost his spirit will become infinite too Jehovah and Murphy Christ in form of his bride I always tell the people when you when you become a Christian in this basically the Holy Ghost don't look down yourself anymore you got power you become little Jesus that's why he said in Marx 16 this sign shall follow them that I believe in my name shall they cast out Devils he wasn't playing it's not just a word it's a promise and I try it every time and it's worse for me in Nigeria now in church we see I've seen the dead raised I've seen God heal the sick my own father went blind I blessed him he received his side back in this message if anybody nobody can tell me now that this message is not true I will say brother you come too late brother you're too late man Hallelujah you are too late because I have seen the evidence of the good land Hallelujah that God is truth is worth it and this message is true Blessed Be His holy name I believe it's very important for us face of God in in Gainesville to cherish and appreciate the mystery of God revealed to us in this last days by the seventh angel a Francis revision 10 1-7 when I'm talking about the pillar of fire today when we're back in the organization um we don't hear much about the pillar of Fire neither knew we its importance as related to the presence or the deity of God or even the bathroom Holy Ghost but this message by the grace of God through the opening of The Seven Seals has started a whole lot amen about the mystery of God than any Christian groups as the War Began you know when that Paul cried out in first Timothy 3 verse 16 and he said and in the class that with that controversy with that argument he said great is the mystery of godliness now I did not say Mysteries that's a plural it's a mystery as of singular right am I am I right there it's a mystery as of singular and then Revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when his Shah began to sound the mystery of God not Mysteries as a plural singular the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets what was it the opening of the word this the the this Revelation 10 7 is what revealed and produced the one the true Oneness of God in this hour what is the true wonders of God man and God becoming one Jesus said and that day what day this day ye shall know that I am any father and the father in me are in you and you and me only this message it makes men and God one by the New Birth by the general barcelon Holy Ghost because when you when you were born again you're converting this message and you got the only goes you got God in you you don't got just a little God you got the whole of God in you because every element every Power every attributes that made the create of Heaven are not God that's what's inside of you too the Holy Ghost he got no power to speak another word into existence and God live there Hallelujah Blessed Be oh Hallelujah Blessed Be His holy name in John chapter 8 verse 56 I'm going to read this scripture right quickly in John 8 verse uh we read verse 52 right quickly 258. uh Hallelujah they came to Jesus then the Bible said there that then said the Jews unto him to Jesus now we know that thou has a devil Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou says if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death are thou greater than our Father Abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead whom make us doubt I said who are you who Do You Think You Are and Jesus answered if I honor myself my honor is nothing it is my father that honored me of whom ye say that he is your god say yet ye have not known him I hate to say that people there are a lot of people in this message they don't know who God is they don't even know who this messenger is he is at all he said that and but yet he have yet he have not known him but I know him and if I should say I know him not I shall be a liar like unto you that's the first time Jesus ever called a man a liar so shall be a liar like unto you but I know him and keep his sane he said your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it I was glad I'm sure but Tommy said oh what do you hear that and Jesus and they said he do something Thou Art not yet 50 years old and has thou seen Abraham what and Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you before Abraham was I am so in our text tonight sins of God when Moses taught to God and he asked God who he is who should I tell them talk to me he said tell them I am talk to you isn't that something I'm going to read that Exodus the third chapter again but I'll read now verse 13 and 14. read with me he said and Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall send to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said those shall thou say unto the children of Israel I am has sent me unto you amen so God here in our test tonight Moses tell the people that I am sent you to them but I want us to notice something today the sins of God that I am is not a name I am is an expression but that's how much is new God I am I am that's just an expression right right I am your healer I am your savior I am your king I am the lily of the valley the rose of Sharon and the brother Morning Star I am the Alpha and the Omega it's an expression I am the beginning and the ending I am the first and the last and you take that what I am I am I am from that point in Exodus although it's Revelation you found out that it always come back to Jesus are you following me Jesus hallelujah praise the Lord I am he that was dead and now at least that's what Revelation did in the first chapter I am he that was dead and now lives that has to be Jesus isn't it he said see God the Father did not die praise the Lord he can't kill the spirit like that right God the Holy Ghost did not die do they put it right but God the Eternal God came to your body and he hung up under the cross Hallelujah so that boy can die for our sin that body and then he returned around and I'm back back now in Revelation said I am Hallelujah so when Moses came out uh came you know he comes every time out into the Into the Wilderness to Tender his father-in-law jitro's sheep and things and you know remember the story when Moses was only living in Egypt with he was not giving a rod like we're watching now Sister the military said in in Ten Commandments that ain't true that's a lie that's right he showed that the the Pharaoh Ramsey whatever his name was gave Moses a rod and send in the wilderness that's a lie Robin and Cecil well we saw what happened was most remember the story Moses went to the camp of the Jew Israelites one day and he saw an Egyptian doing something wrong to an Israelite and he went to defend the Israelites and they killed that guy that that Egyptian are you following me and he came by the following day and here he saw two Israelites fighting Brothers I said Brothers what's wrong with you man you guys are brothers when you find one another you brothers and the one that was wrong said who you who are you talking to do you want to cut cumula you killed the Egyptian yesterday yeah and Musa wow so everybody know they know about my secret now oh they know what I did and that's why Moses ran away from the Egypt from that place not not in the Lord and a bottle of water bottle and said man now that's allowed the devil yeah and Moses went into that land of the midianites and he met with Jethro and Jethro hired him and whatever and he married his daughters and everything and and every day the the deal in the contract is that every day he gonna take his the the rod the street that Moses had he got it right in midianite and they took that road and they tender the flock every day and it goes every day like that and bring the ship back to the house but this particular day was different and he was turning the floor up with the weight and uh they let the ship start going and gracing and eating you know and he just sat down there all of a sudden he has a sound and turned around he looked right on the right there in the desert in the wilderness there ran a little pass out of the hill and saw a fire burning and well that's not maybe somebody was there working it though you know he didn't pay any attention they look back again therefore I still burning he looked back again therefore I didn't burn it but an extreme part of it the leaves were not being consumed he said this is strange and Moses stood up I mean go step aside and see what is going on this this is strange and that's not just making the first step a voice performed that fire said Moses Moses right take half thy shoes for the ground that which thou stands the Holy Ground I mean to speak I am the god of your father Abraham Isaac and Jacob but they did what I've done put it across tonight before I go to the main part of this message is this that the Bush was not burning even though the fire was you know going like that well that means it's not the kind of fire that we have today right it's a different kind of Fire it means it's a kind of fire that doesn't need oxygen to burn because the leaves were not being consumed it's a supernatural father fire what it was it was the pillar of Fire that came down there to cause attraction so it can commission His prophets you know a manifestation a presence to the prophet so it can fellowship with him now that's what the Bible said the pillar of fires the Holy Ghost hallelujah praise be to God so all right so Moses was commissioned there that day and we remember the whole rest of the story do I wonder I don't want to take time tonight and Moses went he went back to Egypt and to take Israel out and everything and and we know all the plagues and whatever all the power that that all the supernatural thing that took place there but Mrs when Moses took Israel out of Egypt and they came to the Red Sea when Israel looked back they saw the host of Egyptians right behind them closing on them oh my God and right to their left hand is a mountain to their right is the mountain nowhere to fled and right in front of them they were blocked by the Red Sea and the Bible said but we need to cry oh Moses oh most what have you done to us Moses she's like why don't you leave us in Egypt where we can have a great where we can bury us and whatever more what have you done through us and they cried and when they cried the Bible said Moses cry also unto God when people were crying God did not say one word but they don't know who he was but when Moses cried then God spoke and God said Moses why cry speak the word hallelujah what do you have in your hands the rod and Moses took the rod and he lived on the Red Sea and the Bible said that that night is strong wind came and stopped the racing from flowing and that that that that what I keep patting up about 19 feet high Hallelujah but here's what the good thing about it before the rest he parted what is Egypt was closing up on Israel that pillar came down praise the Lord you become a bigger bigger street light for Israel that they can see but on the other side of Israel before Egyptian is a student blackout right so that Egypt cannot see through to see the Israelites and they stopped Hallelujah so why does why the blackouts stop them the pillar of fire became a light for the Israelites and the Red Sea parted and they walk across the Red Sea and that's not a client to the bank of the rest on the left side the pillar fire moved to the Israel side Hallelujah and then God removed that Blackness then Egyptians can now see oh they went through the rest we're gonna do the same thing and you know the rest of the story they came through and the water cover them and they perish in the rest but but he that's where I'm going tonight and since that that was the first time that Israel will see the pillar of fire praise the Lord and and um if you notice in in Nehemiah chapter 9 Brothers feet at the back they feel Nehemiah chapter 9 verse 12 to 19. it's explained how that during the day the pillar of fire became a cloud right but at night it was a pillar of Fire but the same money presence of the almighty God are you with me because I stayed with Israel for 40 years in the wilderness on the Arabic Promised Land I want to read the Nehemiah we have your Bible record Nehemiah Nehemiah chapter 12 chapter 9 verses 12 and verses 19. he said moreover thou letters them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in the Night by a pillar of Fire to give them light so it was a street life for them to give them light in the way wherein they should go now go to verse 18 of the same chapter say yeah when they had made them a molten calf after the the Moses got the Ten Commandments and then they saw him you know they made a molting cave and said this is thy God that brought it out of up out of Egypt and had wrought great provocations made God mad yet thou in thy manifold mercies for Success them not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed now from them by day to lead them the way neither the pillar of Fire by night to show them lights and the way we are in they shall go that Pillar of Fire became part of Israel's Journey and there's a good part of it right from the open of the Red Sea another pillar for having to lead them the news spread around like fire all those countries on the way the amalekites the jebo side the parasite the Philistine they were scared to death of Israel even when people of Jericho heard about Israel they were so scared to death they said there's a God among them who works with them in the pillar of fire and they were scared to death are you following me today and they stay with them until they arrive in the promised land and Joshua divided portion the next time that we will um well the next time Israel will hear about the city plural fire again and and hear his voice was in in Exodus the 19 chapter verse 3 when Moses was called up to the mountain by God to receive the Commandments remember and when was it because God said he wanted to talk to the people himself remember but around says when Lord came down the pillar of Fire on the Mountain and I want to talk to the people he said because of the powerful manifestation around the area the fire burning the wind blowing the animals from the Helter Skelter Israel could not stand all those thunderings and all the Lightnings and the Thomas the Moses you go ahead and talk to that God and come tell us what he says they were afraid to talk to God now but once that's why from that time on God decided to send His prophets to the people but okay we come back for the next 40 years the pillar of fire was with Israel now okay the nest I will hear about the pillar of fire manifestation after Sunrise manifestation was when Solomon was dedicating the temple and now the Bible told us when Solomon uh was beginning to empty Temple and he prayed to the Lord and asked God to come down bless your people whenever whenever they're in trouble somewhere and they turned into the 12th direction of this Temple you hear from Heaven a lot of stuff like that and the Bible said that the the Cloudy pillar came down declarative presence came down there to the point that the glory was so heavy that the priest could not Minister because of that presence that even the priests had to walk outside isn't the Bible there right there the simpler fire the simple in the day is a pillar in the cloud in the night it's a fire burning fire Lively fire are you fully with me today that's in First Kings chapter 8 verse 10. all right the next time we're here by the player fire again was when Jesus you know during his ministry towards the end of his ministry during his adoption at Mount transguration and the Bible said Jesus went to the man with Peter James and John remember the story and while the others said that the cloud came down remember that cloud that's the presence of the almighty God there and him said the almighty God the presence came they had to to vindicate who he was and they saw Moses and Elijah talking to him about his death burial and resurrection and Peter said oh my lord it's good to be here but remember I want to start a denomination he said oh it's good to be here if he pleases you Lord let's build a tabernacle for one for Moses one for Elijah and one from you for one for you but but that's not what God was intending for that Supernatural manifestation he said a voice came through that clarifier and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him don't build no other organization don't build no denomination the pillar of proud right there to vindicate the presence of the Lord Jesus of God of heaven and flesh and we did not hear about that Pillar of Fire of Love Cloud again until Acts chapter 9 verses 1 to 22. when that one whole stubborn hard-headed try to see man Call Saul of Tassels was on his way to semester to Damascus to arrest the Believers and while he was going there it was almost on Damascus he saw a light from Heaven come on come on that cloud can die again but being a scholar he knew what I was but because we don't know what that was he would not call it Lord when that president came down and the voice came from that that cloud cloudy flight and said Saul Saul why persecuted down me and Saul said who are thou Lord right and guess what he said now say I am Jesus he ain't no more The Jewel of the Old Testament he's not Jesus now he has a human name a Redemptive name I am Jesus whom thou persecuted it's a hard thing for thee to kick against the priests and and the people thought oh my God what shall I do now and you know the rest of the story he went to ananias and whatever and and and he was saved and he went to the ministry one of the best the greatest airports of the of Ages and we did not hear about the pillar of Fire or the of them well so I I I I jumped I jumped something I had to come back right quick right yeah Pentacles excuse me right back remember they are Pentecost on their Pentecost the pillar came down after that Transfiguration experience the Philadelphia came down the Bible said when the day off I'm going to read that directly before before we close tonight the Bible said when the Pentecost was fully come they were all together in one Accord I like that word one Accord because that's what the Church of the Living God needs God works in unity God does not like division people of God that's what we always said we will stay with your pastor God Reverend told that guy in Arizona says stay with your pastor and God will work Miracle among you still it's not because the Brazil is there because he's a friend or I know him stay with your pastor people that's God's order that's God ordination that's the word of God save your pastor because that means protection right are you following me today the all kind of demons flying around today in the message and they were all one Accord and when it's in verse chapter two of Acts verse 1 7 when a day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a son from Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind and if you love the house where they were sitting and they appeared to them clothing tongues like us of Fire but if I said I'm already quote by around saying it was that same pillar right I came down there that this they were praying that was 10 days after his Ascension and that pillar felt like a ball came down the room where they are and in John Mark's house in the upper room and when that build up that ball of fire came to the room he said this time if this Sunday has never done before before he divides that severally as clothing tons of fire and rest on each of every other disciples right in the room each of them became a part of the pillar of fire hallelujah praise God and then the next time we've ever heard about the pillar of fire is is where we just couldn't join in Acts chapter 9 during the time when Paul was on due to Damascus okay now we didn't hear about the people of Friday more since then since that Damascus Road experience the next time by the way that we heard about Pillar of Fire was in 1909 in 1909 a little boy was born in a little cabin here in this country not in Nigeria where I come from nothing no nothing not in Europe not in South America here in America a little boy was born and that little cabin in Kentucky and while he was laying the crib that day as long as the the the testimony in my life story it like him from the heavens that's in pillar of light came from the heavens during the day and the real daylight entered through the shadow of the window and enveloped that boy in the crib in the room and these parents were now religious people and everybody in the neighborhood coming to see what manner of a Child is This and That Was the baby Branham William Branham and that pillar fire enveloped him showing that he was not just an ordinary baby he was a problem he was born a prophet of God William Brown said you don't go to school to be a prophet a prophet is brown a prophet and I I I pray that people that have followed this message will realize what they are doing by trying to discredit William Branham or say knock on a manner of foolishness against this message or the supernatural Vindication that follow this message in every age whenever God said a prophet to that one word of that messenger a prophet is total Annihilation from God it to that cut out blasphemy of the Holy Ghost and I'm feeling unforgiving sin unforgivable sin you know and and that that like cover that boy and uh and then we know with the rest of the story I don't want to waste time because of our time and I'm going to close very shortly on that and and then when it was uh liberal grown about seven or nine years old he himself told my life story another ninja came to me I was going to fetch Water Somewhere someday and that angel that came that light that symmetal of Lord the Lord himself he wasn't spoken through the dark popular tree and said do not smoke or drink or defile your body in any way for when you die when you grow older I got a job for you yeah are you following me but okay well it came it happened it wasn't Baptist Church it was a preacher I think of the Bible and in 1933 in Ohio River he was baptizing some converts and then when when it was but that's in the 17th person uh James Humes took me there many years ago he said that light started coming from the old bridge you know the old wooden bridge of across Ohio that light that pillar flight deploy fire came down there and walked his way slowly and people saw it moving at the lower range and was moving all the way coming all the way until they come to wherever I was stand the river and hung on his head right the pillar of fire people and a voice from that Pillar of Fire and said as John the Baptist was sent to Faron the first coming of Lord so uh you sent the message that we foreign this second coming of the Lord 's carried it the journalists carried it they don't know what it was but they know it was a supernatural manifestation people we are not just following a commonly devised favors why now why is it that today in this message we have scoffers people who have their daddies or their granddaddies have worked with William Branham and then today they are saying William Brown is for us people how what a blasphemy what a blast for me today I am born in America I was born in Africa are you following me when I came to America the first time I thought when I go to America everybody in America will never William Branham because in Africa we right sisters William Brown they know William everywhere but we evangelize we win Soul we give the books out we give out the tracks we don't play around we stay all night praying for days to get this message out I said surely when I go to America everybody Gonna Know Who William Brown is with all this Supernatural Ministry he had I came here to America I learned in I believe Florida or Georgia I married somebody I was trying to win so like I didn't have Nigeria I said brother I said have you ever heard about the name William Branham he goes William who has a William Mariam Branham he said who is he I said what I said is a mighty Prophet a prophet Mighty in words and deed born in Kentucky in the band look at me say I don't know wow wow that is string in America they don't even know who he is and there are many people in this message today in our message churches they do not know who William Burnham is they do not know the importance or the efficacy of these summer books look if you go to the pastor Dave's office right now you see he gave me some books I'm taking home with me we don't play with the books we don't play with the tapes people come to church in this message they just want to hear some song and and stay a few minutes and then go home and watch television what a child what what a town we're living in today or go home and stay behind the computer and stay on the internet for a good five hours and that internet is not about seta's magnets you go there to check your emails you could stay there for the next five hours and your back will be hurting too or you'll follow me but they cannot afford to play this someone test for the deal for just 15 minutes they cannot afford to read this book or even read their Bibles for 10 minutes what a time we living in right and God came down in this day instead of the Prophet Vindicated in the pillar of fire William Branson in in the in all the ages all in the world in the entire Bible only two prophets were under the pillar of fire Ministry Moses and Paul right William Brown been the third person to be another fire Ministry we are not just following a man we have fallen a Vindicated prophet we should be proud of it this is not the time for us to to be discouraged this is that to back up now this knife this is not the time for us with reasoning or is it true or not I don't care look let me tell you if you have anybody with a sour spirit in the church don't hang around him or her did you hear my English if you say it fine if you know of somebody that just have a sour or bitter Spirit he's always complaining complaining against the pastor complaining again because you're gonna complain against the message too is a demon is an evil spirit that's why that's why I live my life if you don't love this message we cannot be friends with man you're my friend let me let me people like to complain too much they complain they come but everyone said that message take the take the road and gather the people he said maybe some of those poor Israelites they let garlic and onions to eat Angel's food and was complaining about it they were eating Angelic food they were complaining about it look at the kind of message the manner from heaven we got today seven cast many look you go to I don't know if you go to denomination God they have a fellowship and see how dead they are today those churches the organization they are dead right all they got is some whoop up music and that's it brother wait they don't have no life among them you go and check it out to see how precious we are people how special we are to have a message and a messenger are you following me today we cannot be paying me this man there's no time for us we complain anymore we should be certain of God that's what but the Bible said you see they are let the Muddy Waters of Egypt they like garlic and onions onions to eat in Galax food and was complaining about it think about it people they are left the Muddy Waters of Egypt to drink from the Fountain of Life and we are complaining about it yeah yeah think about it they allowed the Boston physician of Egypt to be with the great physician himself and what's complaining about it I don't care many daughters you have in America if Jesus don't heal you they cannot help you because he is our healer no not us the doctors not those medicine because if they are the Healer then the scripture is broken Isaiah said it was blue it was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and it's just testments of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we were healed two thousand years ago that's the great physician why should we leave the great vision and he's the world tonight he eat the spoken word tonight why should we leave him to go around all this against Sayers yeah I didn't want to hear no complainers it doesn't bless me it made me weak but everyone's complaint is not good sister Silas say complaining weakens your faith yes that's what he said he said and they were complaining about it they are left they boasting position of Egypt to be with the great physician and was complaining about it they let a bunch of people that believed the days of Miracles were passed to be with a bunch of people that believe that all things were possible and still complain about it think about it he said isn't that just like the church today huh come out of Egypt organization denomination come out of the world out here in this glorious Church of the Living God and there's only one Church by the way in this glorious church of living God the firstborn he ain't talking about the denomination that he talked about the mercy of the hour the Church of the firstborn that's Malachi for messy followers amen and because we have little of of because we have little trials because economy is not good in America God asks us to believe and to hold on keep holding on let's keep holding on I love the Sun that brother brother but I'm not close I'm close now I love the Sun that brother uh yes billion uh 19 years ago said this in the time to get discouraged this Hindi time to turn around you can't fight with your back to the devil you cannot fight with your back to the devil

leave my house as a sister in the name of Jesus Christ come back to your body come back to your body your pastor loves you the people love you your family love you come back to your body but I'm said when Jesus went to the river Lazarus he was calling Lazarus in the spirit world you remember the old Paradise that was under the Earth remember before the blood was shed and my brother when he said Lazarus William Brothers echoed into eternity searching for the owner of that name when God is calling you you know he's calling you we say that song when the Savior occurs I will answer when he calls for me I will hear when the Savior calls I will answer I'll be somewhere listening for my name oh I'll be somewhere listening I'd be somewhere listening if you have the seed of God in you you will hear when they call you and as a matter of fact he is calling you tonight Hallelujah William Brown said anytime any other time the gospel is preached it is your name being called yes that's me hallelujah amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever yes it's me it's your name being called because you are Mrs Jesus you are the word bride Hallelujah I lay my husband says a sister come to your body all of a sudden I back up from her after the prayer with her pastor all of a sudden the sisters moved and lifted her hands she was gone she was dead they have tube and I'm in my mouth they passed dream to her body she has said handle take that tube and remove that tube into out of her mouth and spoke now you tell me Jesus is not still a Healer you're too lit man you're too

Vision now I don't like hell Vision I love the Holy Ghost I love the promise of God because heaven are not will pass away but this world shall never pass away Ohio River and and commission a prophet are you with me let me leave this alone I'll come out of this The Nest I will hear about the pillar of fire again was in Sam Houston's Colosseum in Texas remember that time when that old demon possessed Baptist preacher who was arguing against Divine Healing a manner of nonsense I can't let me go and talk let me go and prove to that guy but the man said no I don't like argument we don't like to we don't force new house of God but Abraham said I'm not gonna boss what's it brother I'm not gonna Force he said if you promise you're not going to force I'll let you go so I'm not going to follow them let me go and meet that I'm the boss what went to the platform and and said brother tied that guy up with all kind of divine promises on healing that guy was it was blue in the face spoken for you now step out out of the balcony and came to the platform Abraham came behind the platform very humble man of God you see Brethren I'm not a Healer and I don't claim to be one I think our brother misunderstood me and things like that and they were taking pictures to make fun of to make just make fun of Brothers what right and they know of all those pictures all of them were black I know you have it somewhere here praise the Lord and right there this picture right here when that was when with all these negative was developed only this this one came out behold that simplify again hanging to vindicate his profit are you following me I'm not close with this right here because I put all these Demons of you know what kind of force doctrines truth denial and this message is not what we need at this time the hour is too late for that the next time we hear about the pillar of fire pillar of course it was in the millions and things you know but next time it came down that it was visible to the world to everybody to people out there again was a man sunset remember right right when the Seven Angels Came Down right you know you remember you're ready to Sun your ears for all of that in the message sources this is the time remember how that this heavenly Messengers come to me or whatever more and those everything just came down and spoke to him and they asked him to go back to Jeffersonville that we all come to you one by one for the opening of The Seven Seals and when those something just clean up they form that cloud again see if that had been denied if they've been the pillar of Fire are you following me right there that everybody can see it how many brown said and it is our Lord up there science live magazine packed it yeah yeah he said we didn't take the picture they took the picture United States Air Force send airplanes over there consists my high can serve much across they say there's no Airline there's no war plane there there's no moisture there needed to form a cloud they said this is a mystery cloud and for anybody in this day and under this message in this message churches to claim that is that's the horse that fellow is demon possessed that person has a devil and I want to say this church in close today the same Pillar of Fire that ladies Center of Egypt is the same Pillar of Fire with us today and as a matter of fact he was not just on William Bram their simplifier is right here in this church tonight now right now as I'm talking to you that's why that's the anointing I've been feeling that's the anointing of your of the world that's his presence Hallelujah you cannot break the scripture he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there will be in their Miss Hallelujah bless sir be the name of the Lord how can anybody doubt that right right how can anybody put stuff on the internet on the TV against that that person is is is is possessed by evil spirit but I say unto you people this message was brought and Vindicated by the pillar of Fire Christ himself Jehovah and Murphy in our midst and is here tonight to bless you he's here to heal you I don't if you have lost your job he's gonna bless you give you a better job let me tell you this I know that they're coming over the American economy is very bad now but the economy by God is getting better every day God is not promised to bless you and I based on the economy of any country in the world Philippians 4 19 Paul said but my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches not in America he said according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus Hallelujah that's what I like people with God here today that we are not living on the economy of the world we are living on Eternal economy that can never fade away so I asked tonight people be encouraged tonight be strong in the Lord and the power of His might Jesus Christ is not dead he's the same yesterday today and forever and his power is still the same if you are here today you still want to receive the Holy Ghost you can refuel the Holy Ghost tonight people are receiving the Holy Ghost in Africa our young people our older people they are living the Holy Ghost last last Last Friday in Florida during the convention I was the Holy Ghost asked me to have a prayer line for the people have a long prayer and say if you have the only if you need the Holy Ghost I challenge you in Jesus Christ's name I didn't bring you an African Gospel I bring you the End Time Gospel Hallelujah and the people line up there and they were being filled the Holy Ghost if you are here in this assembly you need the Holy Ghost right right he's here the pillar of fire is here to bless you if there's some evil thoughts going through your mind deeply advice here to give you a positive thinking the mind of Christ if you can believe all things are possible people all things are possible to everyone that I believe I'm I'm close in here let me read this one but Abraham said he said uh he said they said uh what we need today is the next turn time people are getting complacent the churches are getting cold by the way how you follow them everywhere but everywhere I go message churches people are cold they call them something like as if God is dead God is not dead that's him fire is right the player fights right here right beside you right now time to our Discovery the pastor we're having a good job in the house last night that's what give you charge in the church that's why you feel the anointing from Hallelujah Jesus Christ is not dead he's alive forever more if your marriage is shaky I know in this message we have a lot of people that can pretend a lot husband and wife is going to fight like cat and mouse in the house and then come to the church as they'll look people from the house driving to church they're gonna fight I know you're laughing but he knows the truth though right you know I'm sorry that's all right go ahead and lower the gospel I always tell my church members whenever I speak and they say I love you I say oh you laughing go ahead and laugh at the gospel I know I'm sure you're laughing because you're guilty you know but you know the devil hates us people but Jesus loves us I like that someone sing Jesus loves me this I know how do you know for the Bible tells me so little ones to him belong we are weak that's right but he is strong we in Nigeria we sing a song serving our living God we are serving our living God Amen serving a living God we are serving all we are serving a living God who is mighty in word indeed you come to church they won't even talk to each other in the car right away like chameleon now they want to hold hands then God bless you uh brother and sisters here now I'm nothing about you now but the Nathan sister Nathan God bless oh God bless you we're happy and we yeah we're happy we are you're happy you're right you know you're happy and they come to the church and sit down people the hour is too late for their people right right if you have the Holy Ghost the love of God is shed abroad in your hearts you will love your wife you forgive your enemies you will not stay in your home and criticize your pastor did you know that any man any child member that can stay in their home or in the parking lot or somewhere else and speak against their Pastor they are demand possessed yes sir all right are you going to save internet or not I'm telling the truth man actually I don't fear nobody now I only fear him I'm going to Nigeria tomorrow anyways if you go around your pastel how's it going to be able to do anything good for you right you have to respect a man before his gift can work for you exactly are you with me today even the medication they give in the hospital those couplets and vitamins if you don't the drug the Frozen doctor will make you do is to have faith he's gonna work for you first because oh you're gonna be all right you're gonna be all right just take this I say oh and you believe that that's how simple it is you have to believe in the in the man of God if I can help you you have to believe you don't run down his wife you don't look he's you know it's not easy to be a preacher people it's hard to be a pastor because when you all make a mistake check members guess who you run to the pastor and we pray for you but when we made mistakes or our wives or our children who are we gonna run to yeah we have to cry in the house and say Lord help us and then you order the champion to criticize the past that's why see what she did see the pastor because the pastor's family is on a high platform see anybody can see it's their mistake very easily but whereas there are millions and millions worst mistakes being committed right in the church as The Sinner right and the people and nobody said nothing about it people look we need the grace of God in our lives we need the Holy Ghost we need that caption of the pyramid charity to cap our life Hallelujah so you can be like Jesus in thoughts in words and indeeds beloved Lord Jesus tonight I'm just I'm gonna just stop here I'm not you know I God help me actually I'll come here on a Sunday I got some quotes about the readers you know God help me tonight I'm close enough believe me in the message early spiritual experiences brother man said is that the one I want to read go ahead man I want to read something praise the Lord Hallelujah Lord Jesus yeah that's right as an eagle started our next 1960. he said what we need today is a next stirring time what we need today is the power of the Holy Ghost what we need today is Eagle's food right we don't need no local weeds yeah yeah we don't need Dr Dobson I was shout that message pastored in America they are going they are teaching Dr Dobson's theology brother yeah all right that I don't have the Holy Ghost right right what and they say talk about focus on the family what kind of family not my family yeah when we have the seven sealed broken to us William Brown said if you are a Christian and you have the Holy Ghost you say all that you needed to get happiness out of life is already in you all you have to do just know how to use it that's what he said even when he said when you ask God for a blessing in the message where I think Pentecost failed he said don't ask God for little little things he said ask God for big things talk about a Prosperity preach over there you think these guys they're out there they never got properly Prosperity than we do no sir we know more than they do we just don't Focus we don't measure on that but it's part of the message Hallelujah it is true God said his children will be head and never be detailed it's a promise yeah well don't major look when you are in Christ you got all things Paul said all things are yours right are you with me today William brother asked for big things big things are very as much easier to receive as small things see when you have that faith and you know how to use it you say you're going to be all right are you with me you have to believe that Pillar of Fire is with you is in you is no longer here but the bride is here the pillar fire now is in the bride he will take care of you he will
