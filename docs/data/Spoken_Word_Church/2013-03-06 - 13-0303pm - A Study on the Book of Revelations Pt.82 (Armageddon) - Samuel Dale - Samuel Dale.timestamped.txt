[12:28] amen
[12:30] amen Revelations
[12:33] 1 and then we'll go to Revelations
[12:37] 16 says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[12:39] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[12:41] servants things which must shortly come
[12:44] to pass he s he signified it by his
[12:47] Angel unto his servant John who by
[12:50] record of the word of God and the
[12:51] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[12:53] things that he saw blessed is he that
[12:56] readeth and they that hear the words of
[12:57] this prophecy and keep those things
[12:59] which are written there in for the time
[13:03] is at hand now
[13:05] Revelations
[13:07] 16 I said this morning I'm not going to
[13:10] try to cover the plagues that are
[13:13] written in 15 you know talking about it
[13:15] and starts at 16 and goes on through I
[13:19] just want to make a a insert right here
[13:22] on something that will take place during
[13:24] that time and you'll see in a moment
[13:26] what we're talking about so let's just
[13:28] read
[13:30] 13-6 and I saw three unclean spirits
[13:33] like frogs come out of the mouth of the
[13:34] dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast
[13:36] and out of the mouth of the false
[13:38] prophet for they are the spirits of
[13:40] devils working miracles which go forth
[13:43] unto the kings of the earth and of the
[13:45] whole world to GA them to the the Battle
[13:48] of of that great day of God Almighty
[13:52] behold I come as a thief blessed is he
[13:56] that WTH and keepeth his garments lest
[13:58] he walk naked and they see his shame and
[14:02] he gathered them together into a place
[14:04] called in the Hebrew tongue arm Edon so
[14:08] you may be seated the Lord add his
[14:09] Lessing to the reading of the word now I
[14:13] believe he needs to get Aaron up and let
[14:16] him at least turn the fan on we got to
[14:18] learn how to do these things and you
[14:21] know come on up to the Aon at least turn
[14:22] a fan on because I know it's stuffy in
[14:25] here and temperature wise it might be
[14:27] all right but we need a little a
[14:30] stearing all right
[14:33] now I hope he was following this
[14:37] morning what I was bringing cuz I
[14:41] actually had notes written to speak upon
[14:44] what we
[14:46] miss you
[14:48] know by being the Bride of Jesus Christ
[14:51] of these plagues and things and I
[14:53] wouldn't go and preach on the plagues
[14:54] and that's see I I actually took them
[14:57] out rewrote the notes and everything had
[14:59] to turn around this morning and rewrite
[15:00] it put it all back in so that
[15:03] okay it'll all work out I get to the
[15:07] right place eventually and if it don't
[15:09] we'll get when we get over there so it
[15:11] be all right but I hope you enjoyed that
[15:14] what we
[15:15] miss we miss all of these things you
[15:18] read chapter 16 and you read on over and
[15:22] that Lord willing we jump into chapter
[15:24] 17 the next but you read that there is
[15:27] seven plagues
[15:30] vows as is called there and those seven
[15:34] plagues you know are things that will
[15:36] happen to Israel and to the people of
[15:39] the world during what is known as the
[15:41] tribulation period and that coincides
[15:45] with the trumpets with the the seals
[15:47] opening the things and U if you'll
[15:51] notice and we'll read just a minute what
[15:53] the prophet said but if you'll notice
[15:56] that you're going through the plagues
[16:00] and especially if you have a Scofield
[16:01] bible if you'll look at it it's covering
[16:04] 1 2 3 4 5 6 the sixth vow is the uh 12th
[16:09] verse and then the seventh vow begins in
[16:12] the 17th verse and this is an
[16:15] insert that's placed within here on the
[16:19] uh three unclean spirits like frogs and
[16:22] things like that and coming down to
[16:24] Armageddon it's an insert by meaning
[16:27] that that part of these things will be
[16:31] this this is something added in and it
[16:34] is actually a uh uh you remember between
[16:37] the sixth and seventh Church age there's
[16:39] an anle and the prophet preached uh the
[16:43] uh 10 virgins right then between the
[16:46] sixth and seventh seal there's an
[16:48] interval and he preached the uh you know
[16:52] the bringing in of the seventh chapter
[16:55] of Revelations because you're bridging
[16:57] in in other words you're expressing what
[17:00] these
[17:01] things
[17:04] uh what they make or do see because
[17:08] that's the way that you you come up in
[17:09] the church ages and then you got a
[17:12] breach see you come up in the seals you
[17:14] got a breach right all right each one
[17:17] see you've got a breach and actually
[17:19] here you've got a breach or a
[17:23] interval and the interval is between the
[17:26] sixth and seventh uh
[17:29] plague and then it shows you something
[17:32] that is very important because now
[17:34] remember the compound meaning right
[17:38] remember what we've bringing in the
[17:40] always been trying to bring a compound
[17:42] meaning because see we're not over here
[17:44] this is not to us the literal reading if
[17:47] we read this here I can stand here today
[17:49] and say this has nothing to do with us
[17:52] and I'm exactly
[17:53] right see but then to turn around and
[17:57] say this has a lot to have to do with us
[18:00] because it is showing us where we're at
[18:03] now I'm exactly right see you're saying
[18:05] no that's too different things no that's
[18:08] a that's a showing you a compound
[18:11] meaning what will happen here will
[18:14] continue on over to Israel right as we
[18:17] were covering this morning of the The
[18:20] Three Angels the that justification
[18:22] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:24] will go right on to Israel they'll get
[18:26] justification sanctification to baptism
[18:27] of the Holy go all right see then here
[18:30] we get this part of the three unclean
[18:32] spirits like frogs Y and then this will
[18:35] carry over to
[18:37] Israel all right now if we get to it
[18:40] this afternoon I may have to rearrange
[18:42] something with the brothers cuz I'm
[18:44] always doing that and they're wonderful
[18:46] to to change things when I want them
[18:49] to but I want us to see right where we
[18:54] are at by the
[18:55] word all right and if God God is
[18:58] revealing these things even through the
[19:00] Book of Revelations you know showing us
[19:03] the symbols showing us the places
[19:05] showing us what these are right and if
[19:07] we can see it happening
[19:11] here all right then we can look and see
[19:13] it happening there right right all right
[19:16] and we know what will happen to Israel
[19:18] when we get out of here right right we
[19:21] can study the book the whole book the
[19:23] whole this is our book this is the
[19:25] bride's book and we're just not limited
[19:27] with say the New
[19:29] Testament right we have the the complete
[19:33] revelation of the entire
[19:36] Bible delivered unto
[19:39] us and the prophet would even say one
[19:41] day like this he said as far as man knew
[19:43] of justification sanation baptism and
[19:45] the Holy Ghost said it's been revealed
[19:48] he said then the seals
[19:50] open to show us the
[19:53] future what about it so wonderful a
[19:55] thing to be able to stand here and know
[19:57] what will happen
[19:59] right see but it don't have to go
[20:02] there but what I see of myself here is
[20:06] what I
[20:07] need the seals are the literal
[20:09] happenings of the seal is to Israel but
[20:12] the revelation of the word of God will
[20:16] change these bodies right amen
[20:20] right amen and will take us in a Rapture
[20:23] all right then if we can go in a Rapture
[20:25] then they will follow in the B
[20:28] of whatever to to be made known and they
[20:32] will get the
[20:34] message and and you know and and and
[20:36] they will have their time and we have
[20:39] our
[20:41] time now listen to what I'm saying if
[20:44] this don't happen here I've tried to say
[20:47] this many times if if the bride can't
[20:50] overcome
[20:52] right if the bride can't overcome and
[20:55] and come forth in the word and CH be a
[20:57] change and don't even talk about Israel
[20:59] over
[21:01] there right cuz there's no need to worri
[21:04] about what will take place if we if we
[21:05] don't come to the place to take a change
[21:07] of the body so then they are waiting on
[21:11] us so they without us cannot be made
[21:14] complete see they're waiting on us to
[21:16] come to the position but see I've done
[21:19] read the book that's what I'm if you
[21:21] understand what I'm doing I done read
[21:22] the
[21:24] book If you you had a book that would
[21:26] tell you you know that things and and
[21:29] and and in the book you find out that
[21:31] maybe you're an inheritance to a great
[21:34] amount of
[21:36] money
[21:37] well if you could read the
[21:42] book see the deed to whatever you want
[21:44] to bring it the
[21:46] will and you say this is
[21:50] mine you say yeah but but the will
[21:53] hasn't been probated
[21:55] yet what does it matter that's that's
[21:59] right I've always said you know if I had
[22:01] a something if I come along you know and
[22:03] somebody was going to give me $10
[22:06] million you know right but it was going
[22:08] to be 5 years from now before I got
[22:11] it well I I I would go to all of the
[22:15] banker people I could find that would I
[22:18] could find somebody that would say
[22:21] Okay 5 years from now I get $10
[22:25] million if you let me have a couple of
[22:27] million in
[22:29] advance I'll give you 1 million when the
[22:32] 5 years is up well if he's a good Banker
[22:35] he would read the paper see the things
[22:37] know that it's true know everything's
[22:39] right and he say hey I'll take it why he
[22:42] going to make a million
[22:43] bucks all right you're going to lose a
[22:46] million bucks but you're going to be
[22:47] able to enjoy it that's right it's like
[22:49] we went up my wife and I kind of check
[22:50] on drawing Social Security and I was
[22:53] really checking on me drawing and how
[22:54] long it would take me to get to the
[22:56] places cuz I had kind of wavered 62 all
[22:59] and U we get in there the leg said what
[23:01] you start drawing now I said because I'd
[23:04] lose
[23:05] money she made a couple of calculations
[23:08] she said you got two or three years
[23:10] before you can start drawing she said
[23:12] you realize how long it would take you
[23:14] to get the $100 back that if you wait 3
[23:18] years and draw it and you get $100 a
[23:20] month you realize how much money you
[23:21] going to make between here and there I
[23:24] said hey I think that's got some sense
[23:28] to it I said sign me up she said okay
[23:30] I'll sign you wife up
[23:32] too you mean I can draw see we found out
[23:36] something you understand what I'm saying
[23:38] if you can get something and see
[23:41] it and if you can really see
[23:43] it in the
[23:46] word and then you can hold on to that
[23:49] that's it I have a promise in the Bible
[23:52] I don't have any physical evidence
[23:55] whatsoever to produce to you today right
[23:58] everything I would produce to you to try
[24:00] to show you that one day I'm going to be
[24:02] changed in a moment to twinkle and I
[24:04] everything I've got is false right cuz
[24:07] I'm getting older I'm getting sick I'm
[24:09] doing this I'm I'm going the opposite
[24:11] way but see God has told
[24:14] me that I would come to a place if I
[24:18] believe it right somebody is so why
[24:22] can't I believe I'm it well what if
[24:25] you're not well get me up okay you know
[24:28] you you're the one that's going to bring
[24:30] me out so you believe it right if I
[24:33] can't do anything let me preach it to
[24:34] you get you to believe get you to be
[24:37] anchored into the word right so we're
[24:39] not over where the seals literally
[24:40] happen but we see by Revelation the
[24:44] things that will take place that's
[24:48] wonderful we don't have to go through
[24:50] these things to be able to see what
[24:52] they'll be we already know what they
[24:55] will
[24:56] be as much as can be seen of maybe but
[25:02] not the physical part all right but we
[25:06] can see it we can understand and see the
[25:09] day that we're living is the most
[25:10] wonderful day we were talking about it
[25:12] last night we had a wonderful time last
[25:14] night of doing it now tapes or there if
[25:16] you want to get them you know brother
[25:18] Joel can make some copies off of them
[25:20] but we do copy the Bible study it's kind
[25:23] of independent and kind of you know out
[25:25] we just eat popcorn and and and have a
[25:29] good time talking about the word of the
[25:31] Lord amen all right see and
[25:33] fellowshipping together but see we were
[25:36] in it last night talking about the
[25:38] things that are personal to
[25:42] us right see you can read the word of
[25:45] God but you remember when you read the
[25:47] word of God it seemed like it was over
[25:49] Yonder seemed like it was to somebody
[25:51] else right right because it's kind of
[25:55] the way we were taught well we'll never
[25:57] come to this oh yes one of these
[26:01] days but that's you know you talk to
[26:04] anybody and say the end of that say
[26:06] they'll tell you they'll say the end of
[26:07] the world's coming don't you believe it
[26:08] look at the B time you start talking
[26:10] just a little bit and that first thing
[26:11] they'll say but nobody knows the name on
[26:13] the hour now let's don't get excited
[26:15] about it because I believe it'll be 100
[26:17] years from
[26:18] now in other words it means they don't
[26:20] have to put up with it that's right
[26:22] right cuz they're going to be dead to
[26:23] God that's
[26:24] right but see church I believe we're
[26:27] down here at the end of it right not
[26:30] because there there's doing this or
[26:32] doing that but because of the revealed
[26:34] word not because of a pop com out of the
[26:37] United States or
[26:38] whatever what if he don't come what are
[26:40] you going to do well I guess you could
[26:42] die with in just a little bit see you
[26:44] always want to prop it up why prop up
[26:47] things why not be what we are amen but
[26:50] now if I bring this the way that I'm
[26:52] looking at it it might be a kind of
[26:54] surprise at the end so just hang on
[26:58] and think about it and it says here that
[27:00] there's an insert or a a
[27:05] interval a gap right and then in that
[27:09] Gap you have to put things in there to
[27:12] make it across right right you know you
[27:15] know what I'm talking about a bridge
[27:17] that's what a breach is brother around
[27:19] preach the six seal and then took the
[27:22] seventh seal to bridge it in between I
[27:24] mean the seventh chapter to bridge it in
[27:26] between the and sth seal he had
[27:29] something to put in there he took in the
[27:31] church ages the the the 10 virgins and
[27:35] if you go back and look you'll read it
[27:36] it'll go through six Church ages then 10
[27:38] virgins and then the seventh Church a
[27:40] bridge a breach a bridge something in
[27:44] the breach the breach is is something
[27:46] but something's got to be in the breach
[27:48] if you just said there's a breach
[27:49] between yeah you would mean there's a
[27:52] gap yes right but if you can see what
[27:55] goes in that Gap amen right
[27:58] y l well amen I kind of believe I'm
[28:02] looking at what's going to fill the scal
[28:03] up right you know this gap between time
[28:07] amen that's right and Eternity amen I've
[28:10] always preached to you and I always
[28:12] believe you you go back to Leviticus 25
[28:14] and 8 and 9 and
[28:17] 10 you'll find this prophet's message
[28:19] come at a special time yes
[28:22] right it came in a promised time a
[28:24] wonderful time amen he may have had to
[28:27] die we were talking last night and go on
[28:29] by the
[28:30] grave but yet his message is to
[28:33] live cuz he was that angel Messenger to
[28:36] bring us the message of but he said I
[28:39] must decrease that he might increase he
[28:41] had to get out of the way yes he'd be
[28:43] 104 5 years old now if he live you know
[28:47] that's all of the things but still we're
[28:49] not looking at that right we're looking
[28:52] at what did he bring amen all right now
[28:56] brother Brown
[28:58] this is an interval between the sixth
[29:02] vow
[29:03] plague and the seventh
[29:06] one and what is this that you're waiting
[29:10] us to
[29:11] see so we read it there three unclean
[29:13] spirits like frogs and notice it goes
[29:16] out of the mouth of the Dragon it goes
[29:19] out of the mouth of the false prophet
[29:21] goes out of the mouth of the
[29:23] Beast the same
[29:26] Doctrine so we've been through what the
[29:28] Beast is we've been through what the the
[29:30] dragon is we've been through what the
[29:32] false prophet brings and knowing that
[29:34] all of that is
[29:38] Catholicism coming forth now I'm not
[29:41] going to get D this
[29:44] afternoon the Lord willing will do it
[29:46] Wednesday cuz I'm going to change the
[29:47] directions in a minute and you'll see
[29:49] where I'll turn but you see when we come
[29:52] to
[29:54] it
[29:56] Armageddon is a little different
[29:59] from what we used to think about
[30:01] Armageddon that's
[30:03] right
[30:05] right see arm is just the termination of
[30:08] forces okay but where those forces come
[30:12] from we were down at aens Georgia years
[30:14] ago and a brother preached on
[30:16] Armageddon and he had the Russians
[30:18] coming down and he had the the the India
[30:22] China whatever all of those China
[30:24] especially all that coming down to fight
[30:28] Israel okay there will be those things
[30:30] right but brother Mo came out and he
[30:32] said brother said according to the force
[30:38] seal say where does those forces come
[30:43] from and the brother said he
[30:46] said I don't really
[30:49] know he said brother ROM tells you
[30:51] exactly where they come
[30:54] from now some of you that would know but
[30:57] don't say nothing but where does those
[30:59] forces come to fight the battle of
[31:01] Armageddon right well it comes from
[31:03] Russia it comes from China it comes from
[31:05] here com from that you show me in the
[31:08] fourth seal where brother randam ever
[31:10] named any country that they come from
[31:16] right right and yet he preached
[31:23] Armageddon he said it was Protestants
[31:25] and Catholics
[31:28] MH read your seal book and you get home
[31:30] come on he said Protestants and
[31:33] Catholics comeing against the word of
[31:35] God that's right
[31:37] right sure there'll be Russians and
[31:40] there be Chinese and there'll be this
[31:41] that or the other forces is
[31:44] coming but isn't it odd how the world is
[31:46] opening up now to allow Christianity to
[31:48] go into all of those countries yes right
[31:51] right do you know that in World War I
[31:54] that the Germans had In God We Trust on
[31:57] their belt
[31:59] buckle and we had it on our belt
[32:03] buckle
[32:05] right see we're looking at some kind of
[32:08] a great
[32:10] catastrophe to take
[32:13] place and missing the Simplicity that's
[32:16] the whole purpose that I'm going through
[32:18] the Book of Revelations is to get our
[32:20] mind off of some
[32:22] Beast some Dragon blowing fire some kind
[32:26] of s
[32:28] right and look at it already
[32:31] happen the mark of the
[32:34] beast what is that oh that's that that's
[32:36] that come on that's that's that's what
[32:38] we used to think oh they going to St it
[32:40] right across your
[32:42] forehead we found out it's your
[32:45] trinitarian
[32:47] Doctrine bring it down to
[32:50] Simplicity not make it some great big
[32:54] catastrophe make it what it say simply
[32:58] is once St the blood that's my whole
[33:00] goal we all in the Book of Revelation is
[33:04] to get us away from looking at great
[33:06] things and saying here it
[33:09] is the Bible said the moon would turn to
[33:11] blood I can't explain that to you even
[33:13] after the prophet said it but he said I
[33:15] can show you that's already happening
[33:19] well I don't know where happened if you
[33:22] ever find where it happened the prophet
[33:24] said you come tell me
[33:27] right and don't get down into some of
[33:29] those things that we think the moon was
[33:31] made out of
[33:34] cheese you know that brother Brown even
[33:36] made this statement was listening to
[33:37] tape the other day and you know what
[33:38] statement he made he said if you ever
[33:40] notice that man in the
[33:43] moon you know certain times you can look
[33:46] up you can see look like a man's face in
[33:47] the
[33:49] moon you know what he said it
[33:52] was it ain't cheese
[33:55] right you know what said what and they
[33:58] proved it when they got
[34:00] there he said it's valleys and
[34:03] mountains on the surface of the
[34:06] Moon that you make it look like a man's
[34:09] face look how
[34:11] simple we spent all the time to go and
[34:14] what did he do he said I first went
[34:17] first off he said don't think he'll ever
[34:19] make it that was a statement come in
[34:21] there ear years that's what he said but
[34:24] watching what he said he said if they do
[34:27] they won't find
[34:30] nothing you need that quote from R
[34:32] random he said they won't find
[34:35] nothing well if we just listen to that
[34:39] or read the Bible you know the the day
[34:40] missing in space he had to go back to
[34:42] the Bible to prove what it was high not
[34:43] and to find out how to make their
[34:45] calculations
[34:46] correct they had to go to the Bible to
[34:48] get the time and it says about a day so
[34:50] they run it up there they found out
[34:51] there was about what 40 minutes missing
[34:53] or something like that so many minutes
[34:55] was missing well then they had to go
[34:56] back to the Bible find out that the moon
[34:57] the sun went back so many degrees then
[35:00] they had enough to prove right if they
[35:02] read the Bible to start with it would
[35:03] have to wor about but if they read the
[35:05] Bible and believed
[35:06] it they would been working on trying to
[35:09] find cures for all the things we've got
[35:11] instead of billions of dollars of junk
[35:14] to send to outer
[35:16] space What are you going to find up
[35:19] there brother you don't believe in
[35:21] illegal alien no I believe in stupidity
[35:23] of
[35:25] people if there is somebody there he's
[35:28] just like me he needs salvation that's
[35:31] amen right he may not look like me but
[35:34] he needs salvation right that's right
[35:37] why can't we be this straight honest
[35:38] what if a jet what if a big plane sits
[35:40] down in your front yard I'm going to say
[35:42] hey guys how you do it it's going to be
[35:44] hardd they to understand ain't that
[35:46] something all these uh times that people
[35:51] have talked to these extraterrestrial
[35:53] beings they can always understand them
[35:55] uh oh that's kind of ODOT is
[36:01] it okay get off going on but listen
[36:06] there's three unclean spirits like
[36:11] frogs and it goes out of the mouth of
[36:13] the Dragon right goes out of the mouth
[36:15] of the Beast goes out of the mouth of
[36:17] the false prophet right whatever they
[36:19] say is the same right right y right
[36:24] that's the point this whatever it said
[36:26] is the sign
[36:28] now watch it when we get down towards
[36:31] the
[36:32] end of seeing how come in this message
[36:36] seemingly the a lot of the Ministers of
[36:39] this message are turning back to
[36:42] those word
[36:44] phrases and things that they had a long
[36:48] time
[36:50] ago you need it odd that the first I see
[36:54] in Council was not over the Trinity
[36:56] right
[36:58] I want you to show
[36:59] me it was over whether Jesus was
[37:02] almighty God or a like
[37:06] substance they even denounced the like
[37:10] substance doctrine of the first n in
[37:13] counsel and declared read it declared
[37:16] that he was almighty
[37:19] God but people don't want to go read
[37:21] that they just got their mind
[37:24] see but see the man had already made the
[37:26] inroad of his Doctrine right that back
[37:29] there that taught that Jesus wouldn't
[37:31] god Till The River
[37:34] Jordan that's what he
[37:37] Tau and it kind of odd that Doctrine
[37:39] would flare up in the last days
[37:44] right they were trying to establish the
[37:46] fact of two Lords andin it kind of odd
[37:49] that Doctrine fell back into state right
[37:55] y
[38:00] some of these doctrines are so identical
[38:05] right you can take the two Soul Doctrine
[38:07] and identically lay it with the Mormon
[38:09] doctrine of pre-existence
[38:15] right but yet a big portion of the
[38:17] message people believe that Doctrine
[38:19] especially the Foreign
[38:22] Fields and still believe it
[38:25] today
[38:29] is it odd that those things came from B
[38:31] guar over
[38:35] here well you know brother brand might
[38:37] be right when he said every doctrine
[38:40] that there is come out of Genesis you
[38:41] remember that right he said the Baptist
[38:45] the Methodist the Presbyterian the
[38:47] Pentecostals the Catholics was all in
[38:49] Genesis right now some he brought down
[38:53] with enough understanding that we can
[38:55] clarify
[38:57] nimrods and things like that motherson
[39:02] worship
[39:04] right come out of
[39:07] Genesis out of some of those people that
[39:09] were back
[39:10] there is it odd it would come over
[39:15] today and be right Among Us right ain't
[39:19] it odd that the deity doctrines of the
[39:22] back there in Genesis would come over
[39:23] and they would believe brother Bram to
[39:24] be God
[39:32] right we see people don't want to hear
[39:34] it like that I want to hear something
[39:36] about how good we are tell us how tell
[39:40] us about the good like we were talking
[39:43] about last night when the Bible says
[39:46] that that talking about coming to the
[39:49] the law being a school Master to bring
[39:51] us to Christ all right when you come to
[39:53] Christ do you forget the
[39:55] law
[40:00] the law would be don't cut your heart
[40:02] don't wear paint don't do this don't
[40:03] worry don't don't do don't do
[40:07] don't but when we come to the school M
[40:10] we come from the school Master the
[40:11] Christ of
[40:13] Revelation go cut your hair all you want
[40:15] to where all pants you want to we're in
[40:17] another dispensation now do you know
[40:20] that's a Doctrine in this message
[40:25] right
[40:27] it's called that we're already in the
[40:30] Millennium
[40:34] yeah that's in this message see see
[40:38] church I don't like to be arrogant or
[40:40] hateful and don't call names but those
[40:43] doctrines are in the message right
[40:46] where' they come
[40:51] from the original
[40:54] Trinity first Trinity we call it the
[40:57] original
[40:58] Trinity came out of the mouth of
[41:05] somebody how many of you know that
[41:08] brother Brown Tau that there would be a
[41:10] new Trinity come out in the end
[41:14] time you ever read that we're going to
[41:17] read it in a
[41:18] second that won't be my
[41:22] opinion that it would come out of the
[41:24] old Trinity
[41:27] the old Trinity was established bragging
[41:29] on greater depth but en roded in it 325
[41:34] a day or come in a little bitty thing
[41:36] but then by 606 it began to be developed
[41:38] in what was called a trinity
[41:40] Doctrine all
[41:42] right what about a new Trinity to come
[41:46] out after the opening of the
[41:55] seal
[41:59] you believe he said that yes
[42:03] sir if it came out after the opening of
[42:05] the seals and it came out after
[42:09] 63 you know I'm honest and I'm I'm wrong
[42:12] you correct
[42:15] me I don't know of no new
[42:18] doctrine in Catholicism other than the
[42:21] old Trinity do you has the old Trinity
[42:25] Doctrine yeah n see you coming down the
[42:28] denomination the organization are they
[42:30] teaching any form of a new
[42:32] Trinity no they're still on the same old
[42:34] Trinity right right y same one they
[42:37] started with they still got y MH so
[42:41] could the new Trinity come out of the
[42:42] people of this message right amen
[42:45] sure
[42:47] amen
[42:51] oh got to come out of the mouth of
[42:54] somebody that's right
[43:01] y I give you a break this morning I
[43:04] harder screamed with you now let's
[43:06] than
[43:09] okay I like to do that every once in a
[43:12] while but I like to settle down and just
[43:14] think things over righten am you know it
[43:18] took a long time for me to learn to ride
[43:21] a bicycle a matter of fact I was about
[43:24] 16 years old
[43:33] I just kind of
[43:36] slug but you know what I did finally
[43:39] learn the right
[43:41] one we just bear with
[43:45] me let's see what brother randam had to
[43:48] say about this three unclean spirits
[43:50] like
[43:52] frog and see where he says they come
[43:54] from and when they come out then would
[43:57] you believe
[44:00] it of course after turn on the the
[44:02] internet you're going to you're going to
[44:03] cut it off and you say I don't believe
[44:05] it anyway well going just see what
[44:06] brother Brown has to say go ahead
[44:08] brother let's start off I didn't give
[44:09] them these so I had to give them to him
[44:10] later and you know I'm bad to do
[44:14] that to shuffle things
[44:17] around I I wouldn't asked you to please
[44:20] read the our hearer the mass the
[44:23] anointed once at the end time all but
[44:27] remember it is the the anointed ones
[44:30] that he's speaking of is the genuine
[44:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost anointing
[44:37] someone but they themselves are false
[44:40] you you understand the background of
[44:42] anointed
[44:43] ones you say well how to do anointed
[44:45] ones well then you don't have the new
[44:49] birth because you that you know the ones
[44:52] that have the new birth you got to have
[44:53] an anointing of the Holy Ghost right are
[44:56] you going to say the anointed ones got
[44:57] something greater than you no brother
[44:59] random is explaining the anointed ones
[45:01] the inside the soul of that individual
[45:04] is not born again the outside of that
[45:07] individual is Anointed with a genuine
[45:09] baptism of the Holy Spirit I believe
[45:11] that right all
[45:15] right that's why it's called see they
[45:17] put it the anointed ones at the end time
[45:19] y but it's really the title is what
[45:22] anointed
[45:24] ones
[45:26] all right now watch what he says when he
[45:29] gets over to paragraph 236 through
[45:33] 244 let's just read it this may be all
[45:35] we get on the message today but that'll
[45:37] be fine preached in 1965 7:25 the

[48:17] the dragon see the Beast and the false
[48:20] prophet
[48:22] now you think you some people think you
[48:25] trapped Point down of what I said want I
[48:28] go but
[48:31] remember the old Trinity came out of the
[48:34] Roman Catholic Church which was
[48:38] paganism that's what he's explaining
[48:40] right paganism of trinitarian Doctrine
[48:43] come over to the Catholic church and
[48:45] formed a new
[48:47] Trinity
[48:49] right a new teaching of uh paganism
[48:56] come out from the old Roman paganism
[48:59] that's what he's explaining but then he
[49:01] gets on down in a minute and he explains
[49:03] something else related to this day so
[49:05] just in case somebody would look at that
[49:06] and say hey wait just a minute you
[49:08] explain while to go well let's explain
[49:10] now see there's no such a thing they
[49:13] look back to the naan Council okay where
[49:16] the Trinity was born at notice where
[49:18] they come from where did the Trinity at
[49:21] Rome where did the Trinity at NAA come
[49:23] from and The Trinity of frud came out of
[49:26] an old
[49:28] Trinity from old doctrine of many
[49:32] gods that's why the Roman Catholics come
[49:34] in with all of those many gods they had
[49:37] to get something brother around said
[49:38] because it wouldn't line up with the
[49:40] word where they come notice in the
[49:42] Trinity FR come an old Trinity give
[49:44] birth to a new Trinity their mother so
[49:47] they gave birth to organized religion
[49:48] gave birth to the Roman Catholic Church
[49:51] the mother what did it come out of a
[49:53] trinity the dragon see the Beast and the
[49:55] the false prophet a trinity knew for
[49:59] when when were these frauds come
[50:03] out we did it notice they was there all
[50:07] the time but it wasn't manifested until
[50:10] between the sixth and seventh
[50:13] vow just before the seal opened to
[50:17] reveal
[50:20] it now he's bringing it down
[50:24] our okay
[50:26] he said I feel of people resenting that
[50:28] notice the Trinity the dragon how many
[50:30] knows what the dragon was it was wrong
[50:32] and the dragon stood before the woman
[50:34] div our child as soon as it was born
[50:36] that's right what does beast mean in the
[50:39] bible power right Bible means power all
[50:42] right false prophet false prophet and a
[50:45] false anointed one all right now what
[50:48] false prophet false prophet a false
[50:49] anointing one now let me explain
[50:51] something
[50:52] here
[50:54] see the dragon is
[50:59] Rome Pagan Rome become powerful wrong
[51:04] true right I know you're getting sleepy
[51:08] so high
[51:11] highas
[51:13] now the dragon that stood before the
[51:15] woman of our child was not the Roman
[51:18] Catholic church right so you need some
[51:22] understanding in there right the Roman
[51:23] Catholic Church didn't stand before Jus
[51:25] before married to Dev child devour child
[51:28] when it was first
[51:30] born come on you got to think a
[51:35] little the Roman Catholic Church didn't
[51:37] come along till a few hundred years
[51:38] later
[51:41] right see she's trying to devour this
[51:43] child
[51:45] that comes
[51:48] forth see the natural Roman government
[51:50] was one that stood before Jesus Christ
[51:53] that's right and before he was was born
[51:55] and killed all the babies and the things
[51:57] that wasn't the Catholic church right so
[52:01] now move the Catholic Church on down a
[52:02] few hundred years and then see how she
[52:04] starts trying to Devour the child in
[52:06] other words the word she started eating
[52:08] the word
[52:10] down right through the Dark Ages she
[52:12] took the word away she's eating up the
[52:15] child I've mentioned a little bit of
[52:16] that in Revelations 12 about what 40
[52:19] sermons ago all
[52:22] right started work this is false prophet
[52:27] singular look how specific the prophet
[52:30] would
[52:31] be the Bible says false prophet it
[52:34] doesn't say false prophets you know in
[52:36] the reading comes out of the mouth of
[52:39] the dragon out of the mouth of the the
[52:42] the and then it comes out of the mouth
[52:44] of the false prophet look how specific
[52:46] brother R can be starting word this
[52:49] false prophet
[52:52] singular false prophet the first hope
[52:56] MH now he's so specific with his
[53:00] scriptures he got it exactly in line the
[53:03] Bible says false prophet doesn't say
[53:05] false prophets they in
[53:07] Revelations
[53:10] 16:13 if the th come out where did the
[53:13] come from the and the mother
[53:15] of Harlot the whole thing it came from
[53:19] that original false prophet singular guy
[53:22] that started the first poem now that's
[53:25] that's pretty specific a it you said
[53:27] brother BR really didn't understand it's
[53:30] amazing to me sometime how the man
[53:32] speaks with a seventh grade education
[53:36] amen that he's so precise with his
[53:39] words if you'll take it right right and
[53:43] try to devour what he's talking about
[53:45] cuz like up above there he's putting the
[53:47] dragon the different the the mother the
[53:49] different things the old
[53:52] Roman government was the one that tried
[53:55] to kill or put Jesus trying to kill him
[53:59] it wasn't a Roman Catholic church but
[54:01] the Roman Catholic church after it began
[54:03] to develop was started trying to Devour
[54:05] the child right that's Revelations
[54:08] 12 y coming on down watch a false
[54:12] Trinity was Rising not in the early days
[54:15] wouldn't be made manifest in the early
[54:17] days it went right on through with it
[54:20] but when the Seven Seals become
[54:23] come and open those Mysteries and
[54:27] reveals them that's when the frogs the
[54:30] three unclean spirits like frogs come
[54:32] out to manifest
[54:36] themselves a trinity Doctrine against
[54:39] the
[54:44] truth are you
[54:47] reading when did the seal was
[54:49] open I thought that was
[54:52] 1963
[54:54] right y so there's a new Trinity to come
[54:57] out in the end
[55:03] time where're at see where it come from
[55:07] see where it's going back to ecumenical
[55:10] council they're all Brothers anyhow and
[55:13] the
[55:14] things watch
[55:20] now where we at
[55:23] 241 what paragraph We on how it
[55:27] uncovered yet false prophet singular so
[55:29] we're through with a
[55:30] reading all right come out to manifest
[55:36] themselves now you look around at the
[55:37] people of this doctrine of this message
[55:40] and if you can't find those old
[55:42] trinitarian
[55:44] Concepts you was asleep while ago when I
[55:47] was
[55:48] explaining and then you come up later
[55:50] and you tell me I missed it and I say
[55:53] you wake up that's
[55:57] right had a brother one time he said you
[55:59] said so and so I said I never said it he
[56:02] said yes you did I hurt you I said we'll
[56:06] solve that
[56:07] problem see he thought he was really
[56:10] going I said let's go pull the
[56:13] tape that's why they're there right you
[56:16] out on the internet you say I I caught
[56:18] you here there okay come on let's see it
[56:21] I've got the tapes that I can pull every
[56:23] tape that I preached here from 198 82 up
[56:25] to
[56:28] now and let's see if I said it the
[56:31] brother said well I don't know and see
[56:33] he he was just trying to Bluff me don't
[56:36] try to Bluff me I don't Bluff too good
[56:39] I'm just honest cuz I've always been you
[56:41] know you can run after you you if
[56:43] somebody Bluffs you just Bluff back you
[56:45] got to run then run later you know I
[56:49] mean he bust your nose time to
[56:51] run but if he's Bluff it just Bluff
[56:56] but see if you got the goods you don't
[56:57] have to worry about Bluff in or all do
[57:00] you I
[57:02] smart why in the world can't people
[57:05] value somebody that knows this message
[57:07] over something that's made predictions
[57:09] and made all kind of things that's going
[57:12] on and know nothing about the
[57:14] message and the Very people that's
[57:16] preaching these doctrines that the
[57:17] prophet said he I didn't read I didn't
[57:20] say he said it would come out after the
[57:23] seals what was the SE pre 63 to after
[57:27] then three unclean spirits like frogs
[57:29] developed in this message mhm right you
[57:32] go read anointed on and see if I'm wrong
[57:34] that's
[57:35] right come on you read the whole book
[57:38] come back and tell me I'm
[57:41] wrong he really got strong in anointed
[57:44] once the end time to show how it was
[57:47] going
[57:47] off that people was twisting his
[57:52] message go back and read
[57:58] three unclean spirits like frogs going
[58:00] out of the mouth of somebody it's got to
[58:01] have a false prophet amen right every
[58:04] Doctrine in this message is got a false
[58:06] prophet
[58:07] y if it's a false Doctrine right right
[58:11] and then it can't be but one true
[58:12] Prophet cuz it ain't but one truth of
[58:14] the
[58:14] message so we didn't need but one true
[58:17] prophet and that ain't Samuel Dale
[58:18] that's William Bram right he was a true
[58:20] Prophet so then it'd have to be false
[58:22] prophets come off to try to tell you
[58:23] what he's talking about
[58:27] right right
[58:29] right come on I'm just asking you to
[58:31] check it it is
[58:33] hardd that these doctrines that were way
[58:35] back
[58:36] there right I come through the Baptist
[58:39] Church and what was the doctrine there
[58:42] you don't have to believe it I mean you
[58:43] don't have to have it just
[58:45] believe just believe you got everything
[58:47] when you believed people in this message
[58:50] say that you get all of this right here
[58:53] the day you're born again
[58:59] you get all them virtues and everything
[59:01] day he born
[59:05] again well how in the world could you
[59:07] tell that person
[59:10] anything you know what it would be
[59:13] like and this actually
[59:17] happen most of you know that I was 2
[59:20] years in studying this message before I
[59:23] ever said I had to baptism with the ho
[59:25] ghost because I didn't believe I had it
[59:27] once I seen the prophet the way he was
[59:29] bringing the message I seen I didn't
[59:30] have the new mer you said well I had a
[59:32] new bir all the time it brought me to
[59:34] where it is I was reading six books a
[59:38] day and listening to two
[59:41] Tes don't you think I believe the
[59:45] message you know what I talked to a
[59:47] Baptist one
[59:50] day and I had told him that I didn't
[59:52] believe that I had the new birth
[59:55] brother brother said you better leave in
[59:56] bad just alone you ever heard him say
[59:58] that he said theyare you depart that
[1:00:00] word
[1:00:03] right I was telling this bck I could
[1:00:05] call his name and he would know
[1:00:10] him and I said told him about something
[1:00:13] in the the godhead and the doctrin you
[1:00:16] know and everything he said Sam I
[1:00:18] thought you told me one day that you
[1:00:20] didn't have the new birth you know the
[1:00:21] baptism of the Holy
[1:00:23] Ghost I said you're exactly right I
[1:00:25] still don't have
[1:00:27] it he said then you can't teach me
[1:00:30] nothing he said because I have the
[1:00:32] baptism of the Holy
[1:00:36] Ghost and says you know that you're not
[1:00:38] supposed to teach it unless you got
[1:00:42] it is that Bible right you can't tell
[1:00:44] nobody about the new birth until you get
[1:00:46] the New Birth come on PL
[1:00:48] SS you know what I done I shook his head
[1:00:51] and laugh I mean his hand laugh you're
[1:00:53] right that don't change what I just said
[1:00:55] that's the truth you still need to get
[1:00:58] baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:00] you
[1:01:01] know but you see what I'm talking
[1:01:03] about we think we've got it figured
[1:01:06] out then a prophet would come along and
[1:01:09] talk about a new Trinity that come out
[1:01:12] after the opening of the seal this is
[1:01:14] not a new thing we preached this 40
[1:01:16] years ago a new Trinity to come out
[1:01:20] before some of these doctrines ever even
[1:01:22] come
[1:01:23] out
[1:01:25] I was warning you to be careful of the
[1:01:27] doctrines you hear
[1:01:30] right well brother D I listen to brother
[1:01:33] so and so I didn't hear him say that
[1:01:35] wake up
[1:01:39] yeah I've talked to people exactly like
[1:01:42] that and they say I've listened to Tes
[1:01:45] out of that man for years and he ain't
[1:01:46] never said there was two
[1:01:53] Lords
[1:01:56] you don't understand what they were
[1:01:58] trying to say maybe I don't
[1:02:05] right so you don't understand them that
[1:02:08] that say that that you don't have the
[1:02:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost today like you
[1:02:12] had it on the day of
[1:02:15] Pentecost there's a major doctorine
[1:02:17] among the message forign fields are real
[1:02:19] full of it yeah I can name the names of
[1:02:21] the doctrine those people that taught
[1:02:23] them
[1:02:29] we see they would tell you right in
[1:02:30] front of you don't W do it with me
[1:02:32] because I was there one of them told a
[1:02:35] brother that used to be here is dead and
[1:02:36] gone on now he said I ain't never taught
[1:02:38] nothing like that that's a
[1:02:40] lie I tapped him on the shoulder I said
[1:02:43] turn around and tell me you ain't never
[1:02:46] said it CU he sit in my house and told
[1:02:49] me that nobody had the Holy Ghost like
[1:02:51] it was in the book of Acts I said I'm
[1:02:54] not trying to prove a doctor I'm showing
[1:02:56] you brother random brother BR said he
[1:02:57] met people with the Holy Ghost with
[1:02:58] exactly like the day of Pentecost 50
[1:03:01] years before him right but see he
[1:03:05] wouldn't turn around and tell
[1:03:07] me he wasn't afraid of me physically he
[1:03:10] just knew better cuz he knew I'd sit in
[1:03:13] home and talk to him about
[1:03:15] it other brother was a wonderful sweet
[1:03:18] brother that wouldn't say nothing back
[1:03:19] to
[1:03:20] him but listen
[1:03:22] church I thought brother Bram said I'll
[1:03:25] be glad when somebody gets like they
[1:03:26] were back there that would say you're
[1:03:28] not saying what Paul said that's right
[1:03:31] that's
[1:03:34] right oh you just got your you're just
[1:03:36] arrogant and
[1:03:40] hateful well does that change the
[1:03:45] truth I'm going to agree with
[1:03:48] you I'm arrogant and hateful but does
[1:03:51] that change the
[1:03:52] truth does that make you where you don't
[1:03:54] have to believe
[1:03:56] it I thought if a dum donkey told you
[1:03:58] the truth you had to believe what the
[1:04:00] truth
[1:04:04] was you see what I'm talking
[1:04:06] about three unclean
[1:04:09] spirits injected in between right the
[1:04:13] sixth and seventh
[1:04:16] plague you know some of these plagues
[1:04:18] has already taken place right that's my
[1:04:21] point that I've made with you some these
[1:04:24] vows are already taking place upon the
[1:04:26] Earth some of these things are already
[1:04:33] here why don't we believe
[1:04:39] it you just got a bone to pick with
[1:04:42] somebody I've got a bone to pick with
[1:04:43] one
[1:04:45] thing it's either the truth or not the
[1:04:47] truth let's get this thing settled right
[1:04:50] I mean 40 something years why do you
[1:04:52] think we've been here 40 something years

[1:07:33] opinion outside of that I'm trying my
[1:07:35] best to tell you what he said am he said
[1:07:38] these three unclean spirits like frogs
[1:07:40] would go out of the mouth of somebody
[1:07:43] after the opening of the
[1:07:47] seals but look around you and find a few
[1:07:49] doctrines going on that are connected to
[1:07:52] the trinity
[1:08:00] okay what see that makes me a smart at
[1:08:05] it because I told you the truth now you

[1:08:33] way then Wednesday night the Lord will
[1:08:35] preach I'll try to bring it back into
[1:08:40] things there's going to be a battle one
[1:08:43] of these days it was called the battle
[1:08:44] of
[1:08:46] Armageddon and in that battle it will be
[1:08:49] a great forceful battle in the Bley what
[1:08:51] is it mego megido is that the word for
[1:08:55] it says it even it'll be there and
[1:08:56] brother brandham said it scripture
[1:08:57] doesn't bring it out brother Bram brings
[1:08:59] it out it even the blood would run to
[1:09:01] the bridal mouth of a horse I've been in
[1:09:04] that Valley we were there in Israel we
[1:09:07] went to that
[1:09:10] Valley I I'm just plain honest but not
[1:09:15] contrary if you took all of the people
[1:09:17] of the world and put them in that Valley
[1:09:19] right now the blood would not run the
[1:09:22] depth of a Bridal's mouth if he was
[1:09:25] standing up you say okay he's laying
[1:09:26] down okay you you do your
[1:09:29] carnalities CU a Bridal's mouth would
[1:09:31] mean it would have to be at least
[1:09:33] somewhere in a 3-ft
[1:09:35] bracket and that Valley is thousands of
[1:09:38] miles this away and that way it's not a
[1:09:42] a valley that's ducked out you know and
[1:09:44] it's 5 miles
[1:09:46] wide it's hundreds of
[1:09:49] miles but if you took every battle that
[1:09:53] has ever happened
[1:09:54] there and all the blood that has run out
[1:09:57] of those people cuz it's 26 I believe it
[1:10:00] is times that that place was rebuilt I
[1:10:03] believe that's right 1926 I I keep
[1:10:06] forgetting the memories of it but you
[1:10:09] take all of the battles that's ever
[1:10:10] happened there and you put all the blood
[1:10:13] there that's ever happened in that
[1:10:14] Valley it would be up to the brid's
[1:10:16] mouth for the Bible
[1:10:18] Tri the prophet
[1:10:22] tribe because you took all of the blood
[1:10:24] that was shed there but see it's to
[1:10:27] happen there and it's to be a great
[1:10:28] battle a great destructive decisive
[1:10:30] battle all
[1:10:33] right but you see the Bride of Jesus
[1:10:36] Christ is now fighting the greatest
[1:10:38] battle that's ever fought right you
[1:10:40] agree where's it at right here in the
[1:10:42] human
[1:10:44] mind is that the N the greatest battle
[1:10:46] ever fall and see we're in a spiritual
[1:10:49] Army getting remember the compound
[1:10:52] meanings a physical battle of Armageddon
[1:10:54] but a spiritual battle of Armageddon
[1:10:57] we're in a spiritual battle right now
[1:10:58] you and I are having a spiritual battle
[1:11:00] of
[1:11:03] Armageddon I'm trying to think of a
[1:11:05] direct quote that brother were talking
[1:11:07] about about some battle that happens and
[1:11:09] he said that's what's taking place now
[1:11:11] we're at Katie Baria yeah
[1:11:14] right right you remember that you want
[1:11:17] prophet's message we're at kades barel
[1:11:20] which was a decision time of whether or
[1:11:22] not to go into the Promised Land all
[1:11:24] right and Cades Baria you remember what
[1:11:26] happened the first time they were there
[1:11:28] and they refused to go
[1:11:30] over and Moses said okie doie yep to the
[1:11:34] Wilderness we go yep if you remember the
[1:11:37] story if you don't read your
[1:11:39] Bible The Story Goes that the next day
[1:11:42] the children of Israel come to Moses and
[1:11:45] they said we don't want to go to the
[1:11:46] Wilderness y we want to go across he
[1:11:49] said I'm not going with
[1:11:52] you you don't made up your mind you said
[1:11:55] they said we're going they went down and
[1:11:56] fought a battle and lost a bunch of
[1:11:59] people read your Bible at CAD Barne they
[1:12:03] went and fought a battle because they
[1:12:05] did not have the leader Moses with them
[1:12:06] to lead them through and they had to
[1:12:08] come back and follow Moses y right
[1:12:11] around the mountain y we're at Katie
[1:12:14] spia because of a decision time of
[1:12:16] whether or not this message is
[1:12:18] right right or whether or not we're so
[1:12:21] sympathetic until we believe that
[1:12:23] brother someone was a good brother I've
[1:12:25] never said nobody wouldn't I've told you
[1:12:27] many of the doctrinal people of this
[1:12:29] message that I met and shook their hand
[1:12:31] and that as far as a person they were
[1:12:33] great
[1:12:36] people the two Soul Man invited me to
[1:12:39] come up and preach for him when I first
[1:12:41] met
[1:12:43] him I told to him I said I just don't
[1:12:45] understand it I don't believe what you
[1:12:46] believe that's called I don't believe
[1:12:48] it's because I don't see
[1:12:51] it I've talked to many of them the I
[1:12:53] mean the well I talked to the 700 virt
[1:12:56] man year years ago too but the one that
[1:12:58] was no Holy Ghost Doctrine I said listen
[1:13:01] him preach wonderful
[1:13:04] man but yet he got carried
[1:13:08] off the two Soul Man
[1:13:11] preached against polygamy in his first
[1:13:15] Beginnings but then he started
[1:13:17] practicing polygamy and the ending of
[1:13:18] his
[1:13:21] message I'm talking about good people
[1:13:23] getting caught not talking about some PP
[1:13:27] out of
[1:13:28] Rome talking about Good
[1:13:31] Brothers I've known some good brothers
[1:13:33] and sisters in this
[1:13:35] nation some wonderful people going to
[1:13:38] spend eternity with them you say yeah
[1:13:41] but if they got the wrong Doctrine
[1:13:42] that's what you don't know than what I
[1:13:44] preached 40 years ago that there'd be a
[1:13:46] lot of people die before the end time
[1:13:48] because they wouldn't have the ability
[1:13:50] to come to a change and I may be one of
[1:13:52] them and you may be one of them because
[1:13:54] we don't have the ability to stand there
[1:13:56] and change the moment twinkling life if
[1:13:57] it don't and you got the new birth you
[1:13:59] got to go to the ground first so you can
[1:14:00] come
[1:14:01] up like I told him last night you may
[1:14:04] die one minute and raise the next
[1:14:06] one sure what's it got to do with
[1:14:09] it but you're going to go by the grave
[1:14:11] if we don't have Rapture in faith that's
[1:14:13] pling
[1:14:18] sense you said well brother Dale I got
[1:14:20] you there what about the babies the
[1:14:23] problem
[1:14:23] cuz I heard you say that if a baby was
[1:14:26] there like Jo like
[1:14:29] uh Jonas and like you know Eli I believe
[1:14:34] if Mom and dadd is a born again
[1:14:36] Christian and go into Rapture God's not
[1:14:37] going to leave that baby here and that
[1:14:39] baby's going to get eternal life and
[1:14:42] going to be standing
[1:14:44] there 18 20 years old you want proof of
[1:14:49] it Sharon Rose brother rand's daughter
[1:14:53] MH 18 months old but the next time he
[1:14:56] saw her she was standing at the gate a
[1:15:00] beautiful young woman that he didn't
[1:15:02] even know who she was cuz she was 17 18
[1:15:05] years old she said I'm waiting on Billy
[1:15:07] to
[1:15:08] come see we don't think about what
[1:15:11] eternal life
[1:15:15] is what if it's a spec of eternal life
[1:15:18] that's Eternal y that's right that's it
[1:15:22] any spot of eternal life is eternal
[1:15:24] Luther's justification is eternal life
[1:15:28] amen Y and his the of is just as Eternal
[1:15:31] is
[1:15:35] yours why because eternal life is
[1:15:38] eternal life it's the person of Jesus
[1:15:40] Christ right he not
[1:15:47] degreed Jesus had all of it right but we
[1:15:51] don't have all of it so it's degreed
[1:15:52] into bases that you and I must become
[1:15:54] the fullness of the godhead bodily or
[1:15:56] there's not going to be a Rapture of the
[1:15:57] church that's what your Prophet says
[1:15:59] amen that's right he said we got to be
[1:16:02] delivered of a new birth from According
[1:16:05] to Malachi 4
[1:16:08] yes
[1:16:10] right that's what he
[1:16:14] said said turn this back turn that back
[1:16:18] but you get a new birth of that you'll
[1:16:20] know what's going
[1:16:21] on y
[1:16:24] the birth of this
[1:16:27] message do you understand what I'm
[1:16:29] trying to say
[1:16:31] yes we're in the greatest battle that's
[1:16:33] ever fought in the human mind because
[1:16:35] right now going through your mind is
[1:16:37] quotes quotes quotes
[1:16:41] quotes I got chewed out one time for
[1:16:45] saying one thing and I I simply said I
[1:16:47] said I don't want you to write down any
[1:16:49] notes today I want you to just listen to
[1:16:51] me preach
[1:16:54] cuz you write notes you can't hear every
[1:16:55] word I say I don't care who you are
[1:16:57] right right right even you that can typ
[1:17:00] every word I say you can't comprehend
[1:17:03] what I said you're only getting
[1:17:06] wor the mind is not comprehending what
[1:17:08] I'm saying the mind is only hearing what
[1:17:11] I say and transporting it to the fingers
[1:17:13] that's
[1:17:15] right
[1:17:17] right why you got so much mass
[1:17:21] confusion let see Church
[1:17:24] that greatest battle is going on right
[1:17:26] now am whether or not we believe this
[1:17:32] message and why is it in the end time
[1:17:35] that they've now come out with all of
[1:17:37] these things that brother Bram was wrong
[1:17:39] about his dates out there in
[1:17:42] Arizona yeah then he said this and said
[1:17:48] this is it's all come out after the
[1:17:51] opening of the seals
[1:17:53] right
[1:17:56] right they wouldn't dare attack brother
[1:17:58] Brandon when he was here and say he was
[1:18:01] wrong right now they're saying he was
[1:18:04] wrong and not only now saying he was
[1:18:05] wrong saying Jesus was
[1:18:10] wrong and if I call that name most of
[1:18:13] you would go through the flowboard of
[1:18:15] this church and wind up in the basement
[1:18:17] because you're listening to
[1:18:21] them
[1:18:29] and you call them wonderful
[1:18:31] brothers I'll never called them nothing
[1:18:33] to
[1:18:34] tell but I just don't agree
[1:18:41] no but listen
[1:18:43] Church what about all of the things of
[1:18:45] the message until look at it now around
[1:18:48] the message until you can hardly get a
[1:18:49] group together they're just little
[1:18:51] Splinter groups
[1:18:53] yet the Foreign Fields are running like
[1:18:55] crazy and there millions over
[1:18:59] there but now I'm going to ask you
[1:19:01] something I'm
[1:19:02] sorry but if you take a two Soul
[1:19:05] Doctrine to a foreign
[1:19:07] field you're not going to convert them
[1:19:09] to this message I don't care how much
[1:19:12] you say brother Brown said you're going
[1:19:13] to convert them to your
[1:19:16] Doctrine
[1:19:18] right y you're not going to put
[1:19:21] out money to convert to brother Brown's
[1:19:24] message you're putting out money to
[1:19:25] convert to your idea of two Soul 700
[1:19:29] virt Peru is son of man no Holy Ghost
[1:19:32] River Jordans and things that's right so
[1:19:35] what is the world
[1:19:37] hearing are they hearing the
[1:19:41] truth
[1:19:45] right I told you about the brother you
[1:19:47] know and I told him one time I said now

[1:20:12] that's right I know about being that
[1:20:15] American I know

[1:20:21] truth the world's wanting to know what
[1:20:24] this Prophet taught but what are they
[1:20:31] hearing I talk about what I know right I
[1:20:35] said and listened to a man explaining to
[1:20:38] denominational
[1:20:41] people just trying to get them into the
[1:20:44] message and he was telling them that
[1:20:46] brother brandham was the angel that come
[1:20:48] to John on
[1:20:51] patmas
[1:20:58] that's a big doctor in this
[1:21:01] message even if that was
[1:21:06] true do you realize what those
[1:21:08] unconverted people are thinking this guy
[1:21:12] is deity this guy believes R around him
[1:21:15] is God that's
[1:21:17] right right right that's right cuz I
[1:21:21] believe it was God that come to John
[1:21:22] pmas the Lord Jesus Christ the son of
[1:21:24] man amen
[1:21:32] right but you teaching will we we're
[1:21:34] teaching them about the Simplicity of
[1:21:36] the message brother there we're not
[1:21:37] getting into the deep time well why do
[1:21:39] you bring
[1:21:43] up right if I have been some of them
[1:21:45] sitting there and didn't know this
[1:21:46] message i' have got up and spit in that
[1:21:48] man's face and walked out you said
[1:21:51] brother Dale you would have yes I would
[1:21:53] have because they were teaching I teach
[1:21:55] people that don't know
[1:21:58] nothing that brother randam was the one
[1:22:00] to come to John on even if that was true
[1:22:03] ask brother dick did I explain brother
[1:22:05] brandom to him when I first started
[1:22:07] talking to him he asked me months later
[1:22:11] where did you get this
[1:22:13] at I said no I'll tell
[1:22:15] you
[1:22:17] yep trying to convert people to the
[1:22:20] message but then telling them brother
[1:22:22] brandom is deity while you
[1:22:25] doing you said Brother
[1:22:28] D who's doing
[1:22:34] that I'm already in enough
[1:22:37] trouble I'll answer you
[1:22:41] privately but I won't answer you from
[1:22:43] here cuz I'm already in that much
[1:22:45] trouble cuz everybody thinks I'm against
[1:22:47] everybody in this minage
[1:22:50] no I'm looking for people that want to
[1:22:53] hear the word not what I got to
[1:22:57] say I want to hear what they've got to
[1:22:59] say about Jesus
[1:23:03] Christ do you understand what I mean yes
[1:23:07] three unclean spirits like
[1:23:09] frogs come out after the opening of the
[1:23:18] seals you know that brother random even
[1:23:20] people used to no I won't go that
[1:23:23] bring up
[1:23:25] night but you see brother random loved
[1:23:28] people and wanted to help
[1:23:32] them but they said he had a book now
[1:23:34] this is what was told that he had a book
[1:23:37] written down where people come into the
[1:23:38] message and went out you ever heard that
[1:23:41] story the brother R had it wrote down
[1:23:43] where they come in and where they went
[1:23:45] out if God revealed it to him it would
[1:23:48] be no problem with
[1:23:51] it look at the people in this message
[1:23:53] that come to brother Brown and moved in
[1:23:57] beside of him and things in
[1:23:59] Jeffersonville And yet when he died they
[1:24:03] went back to organized
[1:24:07] religion the Nam that you hear on almost
[1:24:10] almost every
[1:24:15] tape not sure hope God didn't let
[1:24:17] brother randam see those things
[1:24:20] right cuz he would have died of a broken
[1:24:26] heart three unclean spirits like frogs
[1:24:29] come out of the mouth of someone the
[1:24:30] prophet
[1:24:31] said the Beast the false prophet the old
[1:24:34] mother the denominations
[1:24:36] everybody's teaching the same identical
[1:24:40] Doctrine and a big portion of the
[1:24:42] ministers in this message are preaching
[1:24:44] the same identical Trinity Doctrine
[1:24:47] right if you believe that Jesus wouldn't
[1:24:50] go up to the River Jordan you're a
[1:24:51] trinitarian
[1:24:52] screaming that we're W
[1:25:04] this take on these
[1:25:06] time the battle of Armageddon is a
[1:25:09] spiritual battle in The Bride of Jesus
[1:25:10] Christ going on right now right right
[1:25:13] the termination of forces cuz that's
[1:25:15] what happens in Armageddon right yep
[1:25:17] that's a termination of forces right
[1:25:20] right yep and brother R is R and we'll
[1:25:22] get to it Wednesday that the battle of
[1:25:25] Armageddon will be between Protestants
[1:25:27] and Catholics trying to gather against
[1:25:29] Israel right if that's
[1:25:32] right then where are we Gathering now
