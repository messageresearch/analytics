========================================

bending your hands and just have your way and lead us by thy grace and father got us less reliant sister Rebecca their Lord just review a brother with sister Kathy's mother be with all the others that are sick among us we pray that you would bless each one got us in Jesus name I didn't give you the scripture but they'll throw them up in a hurry first Peter 1 and then we'll go to revelations 1 alright so we'll go to her I told you we're gonna try to make a point and go through a series maybe on the church ages and things and come up through so but we're starting it and we'll be using this for the reference to it because of what is said in Revelations 1 and then what we're going back to Peter alright let's go to Peter 1:7 that's a trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold at purchase though it be tried with fire I'll be found unto praise and honor and glory were at the appearing of Jesus Christ now there's a difference than appearing in the coming right see he's appeared he can appear right over here he could appear over here in this church if somebody's healed over there you know he's dark alright that can be his appearing and see then his coming is the revealing of God's Word all right the world can benefit from his appearing because the healings and the signs and the wonders and the thing out there is because he paid the price but the bride is the only one that's involved in his coming so there is a difference in appearing in the coming okay whom have having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets now remember our point Hebrews 13:8 same in the Old Testament I'm in the knew of which salvation the prophets have been inquired and searched diligently who profits out of the grace that should come unto you seeing what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify Christ in every verse right when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow and to whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the thing things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost now not just their own doing but with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which think the angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ go to pirate page 45 Christ some history we'll get to it eventually be literal explains that okay now let's go over to revelations 1 and it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand I wrote in my Bible alone you may be seated I wrote in my Bible a long time ago time to understand I believe that I believe it's time to understand all right the hour that we're living okay now what was our thought we would just stay on this point this morning because we won't be having an evening service we'll be cutting it short in a minute so we just you know kind of stay with the point that we were trying to bring out Wednesday night of doing that you know talking about where the Prophet says it that before I show you anything paragraph 143 the Patmos vision they can pull it up as number one and then we got a 180 we're gonna start with but before I show you anything I want to let you know who I am nothing that marvelous he doesn't want us to get confused about who it is doing the talking now I say there is mass confusion in the people of the message trying to understand the Book of Revelations especially just these first few verses and there's mass confusion about who this is and what that is and who said this and who said what we will eventually get into that but to me this is the point the Prophet said if you don't understand undecided the greatest of all revelation is a deity of this this the deity the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus if you can't you can't get the first base until you believe that all right we can't get nowhere until we believe you know the revelation of Jesus Christ this is not the revelation brother instead of John all right so it's not the revelation of any other man except the revelation of Jesus Christ now it's marvelous and wonderful the hour we live in that God has brought us the message all right but I made a couple of statements there Wednesday night to just to set your thought in a line to her that see you you you try to go through the book of Revelation you wind up and there's a lot of breeches remember the Prophet said there's a breach between the church ages and the seals there's a breach between the book of Acts like in in the church ages there's many breaches there are gaps and they must be filled in by the Word of God all right in the correct order to make sure it falls and we understand all right now so he says now I want you to know who I am what was our thought that we cover one true and living God wanna know who I am before he continues on he wants us to know who he is all right we tried to cover some things on one God and all like that of knowing this is not a second person or a third person he's really not even the first person Jesus is the person of God all right see now if we get that correct and we follow the line up we won't have no problems when we get over into the scriptures and we run into something and we stop we were listening to a tape last night and I can't remember it I know it was Hebrews chapter one I know that but brother Branham was saying something there and what he said physically speaking to the mind you know what you hear was actually wrong because the way he said it so you could take that lay it out over here and say well he said this alright but it's like I've always tried to get you to think about the before and the after explains what he's talking about so when you're reading the Bible read it and look at the before and the after well I just say what it says see we can do that there church that don't in fluence nothing that's not anything to say how'd you say what the prophets say it well it's like I told one brother I said you want to say what the Prophet said say what the Prophet said I said okay here's a direct quote Luther denominated and died went to hell see you want that quote do you want to quote you you won't give me a quote no you can quote yourself to dinner but now we know Luther never died Luthor never denominated he died physically but he didn't die spiritually see it's before and after I've explained it to you over and over but the outlier to people listening when he says the word boards that it's got so many different meanings to it yeah but the before and after explains it because I can say come on board and stand on this board because I'm bored with you well I've just explained all three times you know exactly what I'm talking about all right see then that a way the Bible is that way if we listened to what it's saying all right so now John says he says to John you know John introduces we're gonna go to that so go ahead and pull up on revelations one we'll go to verse four and start John when he speaks he's introducing this one and he finalizes it for the life part of saying I am Alpha and Omega now who is this that's speaking to John on Patmos so you can ice like I said you can spend all you time we run yourself crazy about trying to figure out this angel of that angel or who is this or who was that if where it was that what it appeared I'll go ahead and say this to you so you can think about it and you'll know that it's not gonna it won't run around with us but the angel that's mentioned in verse 2 and signified it by his angel I invite you to show me where that angel comes into being at because he's not mentioned as that away until the 19th chapter no no it's over here see we got a long ways to go but we're not interested in this out of the other I'm not trying to prove a point or show point it's like I say hey I just make it straight you want to put up for Christmas tree put up a Christmas tree that's as straight as I can be I'm not gonna condemn you for putting up on but now I don't want to hear you condemning somebody else vice versa either way see just stay where we are let's stay with the word that away all right and we'll come out to the end with the right understanding okay so look what he said isn't it before I tell you anything I want you to know who I am I like that I am don't you you know Jesus said before Abraham was I am Moses's to burning bullish I'm not going to you tell me something personal he said okay tell him I am that I am right Moses went with that when he got down there he said by rolling in said well well who sent you down here he said I am who's going to deliver the children that I am you get that personal to doing with him in his ministry yeah but he ain't the I am he ain't the one in the burning bush that was Christ so remember that now when we get down to the point in a minute and then we'll try to just hurry it up well look John to the seven churches which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace now watch from him now he's directed he's coming down to tell you something John is gonna tell it to you and who's it from from him which he is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his strong I know he is which was which is to come we know that as who Almighty God not a second person not a third person and he's not in really even dealing as a prophetic realm there he's expressing his deity okay listen and from Jesus Christ good enough to be coming up here but now and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood what's he doing who is this speaking who is this that John is bringing the message we'll get to it and read it where brother Branham says is referring to this that this is the only book in the Bible where as Jesus Christ appearing personally to ascribe to right now the scribe was John we know that all right but now listen to him washed us from our sins it goes all the way to showing who he is all the way through the church ages with this statement and have made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen behold what's new behold he cometh with clouds whoo who's coming with clouds the one Lord Jesus Christ right it's coming with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all Kindred's of the earth shall wail because of him even so he says amen now once who's doing the speaking now I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the LORD which is which was and which is to come the Almighty alright so you see what I was laying out there Wednesday night from what the Prophet said before I tell you anything about it right about these we were doing that I want you to know who I am so now he puts his stamp of approval as he starts off saying this was the one that which was which is which has so come he winds it up by saying I am Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end he which was which is and shall come the Lord Jesus Christ all right so where do we put all the honor and the glory to the Lord Jesus Christ all right who is appearing to John to rock the Lord Jesus Christ yeah but wait don't you worry about it if I can get to the end of this like it is you should rejoice over what is hurt instead of having your feelings hurt just wait just gotta bear with me for a few services until we get a little background cuz you say well just tell us what you thinking I'll tell you what I'm thinking and you don't have nowhere in a world an idea of what I'm thinking see but if you listen you might come out to the right order alright now who is this and if you've got a red letter Bible you know it's written in letter red letter saying I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ended all right John before you tell them anything I want you to know who I am said now is that settled you realize by making that statement I looked it up and I know it doesn't refer to every time but I forgot how many six or seven hundred times it says in the Bible I am that all of don't refer to Jesus or anything like that we know that but just remember Jesus in Chapter eight 58 verily verily I say unto you before Abraham was I am I Exodus Moses at the burning bush said I am that I am now when the Bible speaks of it when it says burly burly or anytime it double states itself or its twice written about anything this dark remember its emphasizing the importance of listening to that point all right so when it says verily verily I say unto you all right that means not just listen that means lay down everything you've got and listen to what I'm saying because I'm going to bring forth something that's very interesting so when G when Jesus speaking to Moses from the burning bush that's what's your prophet said he was because he's the I am over here then he got to be the I on back tyre or you got an eye on back dar that means one thing I am over here that means something now that ain't right you're not going with Hebrews 13:8 okay you see why when he said that they said you're a man over 50 and said you say you you see neighborhood he said before Abraham was I am yeah when he spoke to Moses at the burning bush he said I am because he wanted no name read your Bible to listen he said I'm the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob her Joseph one of the two every witch wish that sit there and he said in other words plain language we just read in your Bible Moses said I know who Abraham here I know who God is I know who Joseph is I know who the God of all these are and I believe it what's that ain't going you saw that don't say that well tell me what it says he said I ain't going like that give me something personal and I got a quote in here when brother Ron said that's where Moses failed he's what worried failed was he said he was anointed for the job with City he got a head - what'd he do he got a stinking dead Egyptian now if he'd waited on God now it's gonna be amazing when we get to reading that because in that reference he's talking about that Jesus said I do nothing until the father shows me why because it was the father showing him well now here we are Connor don't we get we get into these things and we get so carnal I'd like to get this carnal with you I guess God had to go over shake Jesus okay get up you got to go you got to go shave you got to go take a bath you got to go eat I said what are you talking about I'm talking about your stupid me to you there's that clear enough talking about your stupidity to think the way you think in your mind when Jesus said I'd do nothing till the father shows me what does that mean he didn't do nothing to kill God told you no what about you you know it's amazing in the human elements trying to explain our Wednesday night you realize that that being that you are inside of our keeps running when you're asleep you know it's amazing that that thing can keep working and you in a total unconscious state and your heart still beats right see let's don't be that away that's me let's listen to try to understand alright so who is this talking it's that I am and he puts it to word the emphasis would be there to not leave it just to say I am he said I am alpha just not at I am I'm alpha I'm the beginning and I will Megha I'm the ending he's playing the emphasis down to show one true and living God and who this was that was standing before John the same I am that appeared in the burning bush to Moses the same I am that walked on the shores of Galilee the same on him here he appears to ascribe and tells him what to rock now we won't get to it today cuz we don't have enough time on the end in just a few minutes on the thought but we'll get to it as we proceed along in our thoughts that the more and more that the Bible unfolds the more and more you ought to see Jesus Christ right the whole emphasis then is put back on who he is all right so before you get anything about all of this I want you to know who I am now listen this is what I'm going to say and this is the way I mean it where the problem with trying to understand the Book of Revelations of mankind I'm saying mankind which is denominationalism and all and coming all the way down to the people of the message I miss its way I think so that's what say it the problem is trying to understand the Bible from a bunch of quotes our thoughts and ideas that we have instead of the approach that God has for our understanding are you following me all right what is the approach this is the one that was speaking to Moses from the burning bush this is the one that walked ashore to Galilee this is the Alpha and the Omega I like it this way you know people say well he was Alpha and Omega and they'll say nothing in between oh boy they just used to quote that I'm Alpha and Omega and nothing in between let's direct quote but this brother branham meaning there's an Alpha and Omega and nothing in between or what's he trying to express he's expressing you one simple point he's Alpha and Omega nothing in between there is nothing between Alpha and Omega Alpha is Omega Omega is alpha all right now there's another quote where brother Brown said and he's everything between all right now are you gonna fight them without quotes so you're gonna fight your quote with a quote now instead of this being simple there's nothing between the Alpha and Omega because he's not a manifesting any form in between it but he's the Alpha in the church ages he's the Omega in the church age which means he's the same in each age I like the way the Book of Revelations is written to me it's so marvelous when used to read a simple little scripture and mankind has tried to figure out all of those things but to read or we will to when we get all over the next mason yourself that he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks now let's just be his carnal if we'd be I like to do that but make you think we say oh he was back here in the first we think we have the Alpha and Omega down said he was back here in the first and he's over here in the lice now I know what your profit is they will eventually get to those times sure he was a great manifestation back dire and then that died and went down to the ground and comes out over here to the manifestation again that's Alpha and Omega but just related to church hedges he didn't we say well now he was back here but he wasn't over here that Lutheran Westland Pentecost was false and you drop dead if I told you who said that huh what'd you see he's in the midst that's what I like which means without trying to understand it or interpreting it because you go one way you're going wrong we go the other way you're going on what does it mean to be in the midst of the seven golden candle stick he's just as happy in one ages is the other he was just as happy to be in Luther and West this day as a matter of fact you say he was more happy because those people stayed with what they could believe and served him under all that they were doing all of Dark Ages and the death coming forth the killing of them you know 68 million of them and all of that he said the minister the selling of again he's just as much in the first church a disease in the life when he's just as Mitch in the middle church agency isn't any Church age that's how simple I think people call me Saudi that's how simple I think see because you say oh no he was more over here than he is over here I know what you're talking about if you put it in the right order but if you don't put it in the right order you got any more yearning it away now where's a Hebrew Thursday night right you see Church we don't do we understand that's my point of what I was saying a moment ago if we just understood the Godhead we wouldn't be so confused about all the other things was that what the Prophet started off with saying the patent was vision that it's the revelation of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ see then who is he talking about here who is this one this says I'm Alpha and Omega the Lord Jesus Christ no okay you said what I just don't understand but Iran said that even the Apostles didn't understand he said they had troubled will read it then he said they had troubled he said they couldn't understand him he said the reason they had troubles he said because sometimes the father was speaking and sometimes her son was speaking well that's - you got this one up here coming down and divorce from over here saying behold you know so you know all them feelings in their mind but I think sensible uh-huh we'll get to it in just a second who do you pray to where's he at but let's get it right this way who is he he said I'm the Alpha and Omega I'm the beginning and I'm the end it besides me there's not anything else right nothing else in between it's just the Lord all right now then when he appears to John he declares to John who he is uh-huh let's just go ahead and get that part let's pick it up see we're not talking about two persons or one person trying to speak to another person let me ask you the question who do you pray to now would you admit that the biggest portion of your prayers is not audible words brah is that ruler the biggest portion of your priors because the Bible says to Prairie without ceasing well we ought to be praying all day long you know and it's easy to pray if you know how it is you know why I don't understand how all this telephone system works how that they got this one wire that runs from here to California and now they don't even have that they got all these mono filaments and all the stuff that there and thousands of voices is going through one little old system but it works well you know what my point is you know what he can keep up with all of the prior requests that's turned into him right he's never busy you never get a busy signal when you talk try to talk to it he's always there to listen but do you speak you've got him inside of you do you speak to he that is within you how do you speak to the one that's up in heaven no no brother Dale we're supposed to pray our Father which art in heaven where's heaven I thought heaven was wherever God was that where's God at living within you right he's Christ in you the hope of glory all right think about it then who do you pray to most of our priors is just thoughts in her mind write what you know in that same mind there's also all kind of thoughts of Satan and all kind of perverted things you know and how the Lord you know divides between all of that I don't know that's that's all right he just said God man had broke into God and laboratory they broke into work the things that God could do before bread run said TV was back in the garden he said we just never come together until now all right see we look at TV back in the garden there was a tubes and blood tube you can be sued over those of your younger kids don't remember all the old thing he had a little ol bitty screen about this big you didn't have a full-length screen you had a little screen about this big on the first TV and you know how big the TV whoa I mean it was at least 36 inches high I know and you have tubes in there that's bigger than our TVs today he's got them all to working mechanism but do you get what I'm saying man has broke into her god damn little random said our thoughts in heaven were louder than our words on earth it would be careful what we think right Lord ask God to clean that slate you know I don't know what they do in all this stuff today but the old recorders you know you had a thing you could just take a cassette or a Seventeen's real and you can just drag this thing across he didn't just demagnetize aren't you gonna call it and all of those things that go off of it then you go back and reuse it yeah I sure hope God does that with all my thinking but you know every once in a while he does get into you thinking right he does every once in a while this is my whole point we'll finish there we don't get nothing else it's all right the whole point he he can get through all of that and talk to you tell you things that the prophets desired to look into Sara he can tell it to you because he can speak to you in your inner being and you can speak out of your inner being back to him don't think like that they're wooden the Prophet brought her What did he say this lady was talking about you know he's up here son over her speaking of where and he said let me just ask you one question said when you pray and said who you talking to well I'm talking to God up in heaven is he up in heaven I thought he was in you right I thought he lived in you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I thought the Prophet said he wants to do his thinking through us he's talking through us so what is it I'm just trying to be sensible to where you'll think about what it means when he says I want you to know who I am I'm trying to get you to see who he is right here today in your own thinking well some of you are sitting there saying are we seed hurry up some of your saying I wonder if that food downstairs is burning did I get the biscuits cooked right Oh what in the world is this guy talking about we're spending all this time I'm trying to express a point that Jesus that I do nothing until the father shows me that the Prophet said it was time that the father was speaking there was times the son was speaking larra I don't understand you got to hold a ghost inside of you he's at him talking all the time no no no that ain't it it ain't him I wish it was but it ain't him there's another guy does most of the talking in me I'm honest that's why I still like that partner we have an advocate but let me repent and get rid of all the things I don't have to answer down at the rivers we call it what think about it children think about it you realize God can speak to you in your inner being and communicate with you and your priors don't have to be audible but it's nothing wrong with them being audible but you know what I think about when I think about people in their their ways of doing it like audible to this I don't don't do it so much today because I don't have them but I don't mean this wrong I wasn't being truthful you know we always we go hunting we go places and I you know we've had them to console the whole thing of the morning to get us to pray and say come on wait or Sam y'all pray over the food we'll see we don't might know I'm a preacher we're gonna pray for we go let's get y'all getting out here and pray you said well that's what brought around with it yeah Kyle rode around the tunnel brother went hunting sinners so what we do what's their own problem a lot of times we around the table we'll say us quiet prayer take our hats off and pray sometimes we just take our hats off in there hey I know all the quotes - I never be like well I'll come in and he was late getting there this is the story he told and they had done parade and they were getting Billy Paul sat down pat him and he said brother Brown said did God hear you Billy so I didn't hear you well he was making a point yeah but we just say our priors we don't force nothing over on them because there's no need of it cuz they don't care what you doing but we do our own thing well why can't we do that whatever thing just this be ourselves and do it you can talk to God all day long you were saying right you ever just seen you're just saying out loud but you ever just sing to yourself you know I mean my voice is crazy but I'll says I'm somewhere between a joyful noise in an awful racket well that's a pretty good place to put my own color don't know but you know what inside of me I got the prettiest voice if they were heard in life I get so tickled you know brother Adam is the world's worse to start a song off but the best there is in the world to get to where after he starts one word gets a second word right and take off with it you pay attention he'd have that first word wrong but the second word he's right on key and see you musicians tell me first word of a song is what the highest note or ever what you call it that first one peaches for the whole song well that's the way most of us are we're flat to start with well you say what do you talking about I'm talking about don't you sing don't you sayin I mean I'll be going along sometimes I'll they say jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so you know I can communicate with him I can sing about it you see the way that I pray I always pray my father see the reason it is that my father died in house four years old I never knew much about having a father I had to have a brother as a father figure and I appreciate it all now but he's my father you know what I just talked to him so fonder I love you love you Father thank you the father I know you don't understand those human elements you came down and lived a while with us to learn all about the things but you ever reminded him hey I'm getting old or you didn't get old I've heard a lot of things good like that's okay you know women say well there's one thing about it he never had a baby he don't know what it is to have a baby no but he knew the worse and worse of all of that you know it worse a lot worse or thing that's not throwing off on nobody it's just truthful before you understand anything about this book of revelations I want you to understand who I am who had come from and what happened is another situation let me ask you a simple question because it'll come out later does the word come to the profit is that true well did the Book of Revelations come to brother branham or did the entire Bible come to Oh what it's just it's just a book a revelation come to prop well then who was the rest of it you see we've got some wonderful things to think about if we'll just be simple than our thinking the Prophet said who do you pray to I pray to the Father watch good that's what he's dad but why did Jesus come and say now what is the name of your God my God's name is God not here you're being silly what is the name of God Jesus was the only name God ever had I'm quoting brother Branham okay but one of Jesus come along instead ask anything in my name the father didn't say ask anything in my night but the man Jesus said ask anything in my name and the father will do that you know while we don't get our prayers answered but around says you can call him Jesus Jesus and not get nothing but inside of you and you're thinking when you're thinking about who you're talking to and know that Jesus is the Christ so who do you pray to well I see you changed it now and get it okay bro okay brother there we got it now I pray to the ones inside of me we that doesn't work either cousin they asked you to answer the blessing you pray out loud right and there's nothing wrong with praying out loud but like I said you know we get it to the point we want to pray out loud to where everybody in the building can hear us especially in the old days when you had to smoking all over the place and that was one it always tickled me you know we'd walk in and say well okay you're coming in the door how are the non-smoking when they're behind the building no he wanted non-smoking what good was that now tell me it didn't happen come on and sometimes it was you happening with it come on let's hurt your feelings you gotta get right no you don't have to get behind God's not hard of here he's not death but he does like to hear you voice you know you're saying and what are you doing seeing him now if you sing in the world songs who's the one you're singing to right but if you're singing the songs of Zion who are you singing to God loves good music but the random was listen last night and run around city to know someone he said whatever you do put everything you got into it he says because they ain't no need of doing if you don't put everything all right what are you talking about what's the problem the purpose we believe in one God do do we believe it correctly well now let me make one more statement we pray to the garnish within us we talked to him all day long but you know what he's my god I don't pray to the God in you does he see I don't know who's it I might be calling him Jesus Jesus they're not getting nothing I don't pray to the one in you I pray to the one in me could I know where he's at what are you saying he's not even me that's between you and God that ain't none of my business my relations between you and God not between me and you and God do you get the point we spent Wednesday night talking about trying to get down to the thought of one God because he says before you I tell you anything I want you to know who I am then immediately now we go verse 4 through 8 to see who this is this is the Lord Jesus Christ appearing personally - John - right so you think I'm doing away with nine just wait gotta get the story right we might understand who was who and what's going on but he spends his time there saying I'm the I'm the one that he was which used to come that's the Lord Jesus Christ then he finishes it up by saying that that I'm Alpha and Omega B that was which he is and shall come how many gods do you have there's just one true and living God in the Bible there's not a Trinity than the Word of God that's what's talked to us by mankind with his reasoning abilities who was it up in the sky that was speaking up there and said Jesus down here and the Holy Ghost over here and gotta be two or three of them there's many manifestations of God but there's only one true and living God and his name is Jesus that's why Peter and him knew what he was saying when he told him to go baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost they knew who he was talking about that he had no doubts of a Trinitarian concept and really to show you the natural story the Trinity had not been conceived into the mind of mankind it comes on over about 325 AD I like that before it really comes into realities of kind of come forth with a Trinitarian concept the Jews never believed in nothing but one God they had no concept of a Trinity back in the writings of Matthew Mark Luke and John read it or even in the writing of the early apostles but a simple phone who do you pray to I pray to my father well I pray to Jesus now what are you trying to prove you know well what are you trying to prove I'm trying to prove Bible drive I pray to my father that's what the Bible says ask how to pray that's not the Lord's Prayer you know he asked how to pray pray our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name God's prayer is over in Saint John 17 where he said sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth that's the Lord you see Church we've proved a lot of times our thoughts because we won't listen to further advancements and we say we've got it figured out well if we gotta figure out right I'm quoting the Prophet this is what he said I read him other day he said we got it Ron said we got rod that's good but he said if we ain't got it right you got a problem no but now do you understand what I'm trying to say that your prophet said that Jesus and God was the self same person now Jesus is the flesh amen I'm glad you saw that but when if Jesus is the fleshed in the name of the flesh is Jesus what was his father's name he's gonna come my father's nothing what was the father's name the father's name had to be Jesus no oh it was Joe come on we've been in the message long enough his name of the Old Testament wouldn't Jehovah you want to scripture for that he said by my name is Jehovah what I never known that's Bible you will find it and let you read it read that true Jehovah Witness sometimes when they're trying to tell you that his name was Jehovah say what it says here he said by my name Jose I never known Jehovah is a title to a name his name was Jesus but see it wasn't pronounced not it not if they never said Jes us Jesus because it was a lot of Jesus's back there but there was never a reference to whom God is and knowing his name and knowing that name is Jesus his name is Jesus that's why you baptize name of Lord Jesus Christ that's why you're to pray in the name of Jesus because he told us that but one day it'll don't tell you what you're doing he said ask anything is my name well father I want to ask you in the name of the son his name was Jesus see that's where we got it all figured out but then we go this ballistics when anybody says something different but I run said that those that was a dual person father and son was a dual person in here do a person I'll find it a minute and look through a dual person dual means to win a morning we got it now come on look at it Manoj yeah number three Jehovah Jireh 1956 that's the reason people couldn't understand him sometimes it was Christ speaking or was the son speaking other times it was the father speaking he was a dual person they're not two persons a dual person one that's why people don't understand because Jesus was God made manifest in human flesh if you just get that part as I was trying to bring out Wednesday night we're a human being right we're body the spirit or soul God came down to dwell with mankind body spirit so body was a creation by the Word of God spoken into existence the body was not eternal it had to be made eternal in the resurrection and change the body wasn't eternal so the body was a human flesh but in that body dwelt Almighty God body spirit and soul body he was a man I'm quoting brother Branham I gave him to you ins de nada be glad to read him he said benign soul he was almighty God he said body he was a man but said in spirit he was Almighty God but you see I'm trying to express a human part of us and I'll I'll get this wording and we'll quit that the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily well in that flesh man dwelt the soul and the spirit of Almighty God because he was Almighty God now if the soul somewheres else in the spirit was somewheres else then he wasn't complete right he wasn't a being without having body spirit and soul to make him a being a person yeah but brother dad you just make God to to you try to make him to real or something thank God I wish I could make him so real until you could see him when he said if you've seen me you've seen the father well now that was just a statement of well something like something no statement of something like son if he's not telling the truth are than he lied so where we at but do you understand take the thought with you as we end in this part of God was in Christ we'll get back to the scripture and it says in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily in him to all fullness dwell so he was either all God or he would his heaven but but you just said then he had a body dried he had to have a body to live in what do you think he would have lived how could he have come down and died for you and I melchester that couldn't do it he was a creation but he was Almighty God in human flesh but he couldn't die for our sins but when he come in human flesh to be a savior he had to come in flesh he said well brother Dale what are your God gonna look like when you get over they're gonna look just like he did when he was here and see that's why I like it so I like the message you see until the Lord appeared to brother branham up there in the field you know his idea or thoughts or what Jesus looked like would just been his thoughts right and there were many people drought all kind of pictures of Jesus before brother around him ever coming on but then God laid it on the heart of a man named Hoffman to paint a picture of the Lord Jesus now brett Ryland didn't say that's where we misquote him he didn't say that Jesus looked just like Hoffman he says the closest the closest we'll see I believe he saw Jesus don't you you know I
