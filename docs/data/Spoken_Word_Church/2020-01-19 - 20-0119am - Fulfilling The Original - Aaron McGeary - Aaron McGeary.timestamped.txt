[35:46] the word of the Lord I'm very very glad
[35:48] to be here with you and we bring
[35:50] greetings from our pastor brother berry
[35:52] coffee and the Saints there in Hickory
[35:54] North Carolina Hickory Bible Tabernacle
[35:56] we moved there from Fort Worth this past
[35:59] December so we haven't been in the South
[36:01] too long so just be patient with me if
[36:03] I'm if I don't have the correct
[36:05] mannerisms for a southerner we're just
[36:07] we're just learning them and I'm an old
[36:10] dog so it just takes me longer to learn
[36:12] these learn these new tricks but we send
[36:14] love and greetings to you and very very
[36:16] happy to be here Genesis chapter 2 and
[36:19] we'll start with verse 7 and it says the
[36:23] Lord God
[36:24] formed man of the dust of the ground and
[36:26] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[36:28] life and man became a living soul and
[36:31] the Lord God planted a garden eastward
[36:33] in Eden and there he put the man whom he
[36:36] had formed and that that sentence
[36:39] contains so much he planted a garden
[36:42] eastward in Eden and there he put the
[36:44] man whom he had formed and out of the
[36:46] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[36:48] tree that is pleasant to the sight and
[36:50] good for food The Tree of Life also in
[36:52] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[36:54] knowledge of good and evil and I just it
[36:57] comes in my mind as I read this every
[36:59] tree that grew out of the ground was
[37:01] good to eat so God's not trying to trick
[37:05] him if they grew out of the ground it's
[37:06] okay to eat it so this tree that you
[37:08] partake in that would cause death must
[37:11] not have grown from the ground so we
[37:12] know it's not just by the plain language
[37:14] of Scripture we know that there's a
[37:16] mystery there in the original sin and a
[37:19] river went out of Eden to water the
[37:20] garden and from thence it was parted and
[37:22] became into foreheads and we'll just
[37:25] skip for time to verse 15 and the Lord
[37:27] God took the man and put him into the
[37:30] Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep
[37:33] it and the Lord God commanded the man
[37:35] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[37:37] mayest freely eat why those trees that
[37:40] grow out of the ground you may eat out
[37:41] of but of the tree of the knowledge of
[37:43] good and evil thou shalt not eat of it
[37:45] for in the day that thou eatest thereof
[37:47] thou shalt surely die so it must not
[37:48] have grown from the ground and the Lord
[37:51] God said it is not good that the man
[37:53] should be alone I will make him a help
[37:56] meet for him and out of the ground the
[37:58] Lord God formed every beast of the field
[38:00] and every fowl of the air and brought
[38:02] them unto Adam to see what he would call
[38:04] him and whatsoever Adam called every
[38:06] living creature that was the name
[38:08] thereof and Adam gave names to all
[38:10] cattle and to the fowl of the air into
[38:12] every beast of the field but for Adam
[38:14] there was not found to help meet for him
[38:16] and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[38:19] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[38:21] one of the ribs one of his ribs and
[38:23] closed up the flesh instead thereof and
[38:25] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[38:26] from man made he a woman and brought her
[38:30] unto the man and Adam said this is now
[38:32] bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh
[38:35] she shall be called woman because
[38:38] she was taken out of man therefore shall
[38:40] a man leave his father and his mother
[38:42] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[38:44] shall be one flesh and they were both
[38:47] naked the man and his wife and were not
[38:49] ashamed a man we desire God bless the
[38:53] reading of the scripture you can be
[38:54] seated
[39:05] my title this today is fulfilling the
[39:09] original fulfilling the original and I
[39:12] want to use the statement from power of
[39:14] transformation that is serves as my
[39:17] inspiration and just what we'll be
[39:18] building from today as the Lord gives us
[39:21] Liberty and brother branham says there
[39:23] was Adam and Eve walking in the garden
[39:26] every seed bringing forth it could never
[39:29] do nothing else it never could do
[39:31] nothing else because God said let it be
[39:34] that way it had to be that way and so
[39:37] brother Branham is actually describing
[39:39] the condition of Adam and Eve at the end
[39:42] of Genesis chapter 2 and in some ways
[39:45] he's describing to us what would be the
[39:47] silence between Genesis chapter 2 and
[39:49] Genesis chapter 3 because after this
[39:52] scene has been set in Genesis chapter 2
[39:54] immediately we come into Genesis chapter
[39:56] 3 where the fall comes so brother Bram
[39:58] is describing what would be the silence
[40:00] between these two chapters Adam and Eve
[40:03] walking in the garden every seed
[40:06] bringing forth he says it could never do
[40:08] nothing else because God said let it be
[40:11] that way it had to be that way and
[40:13] brother man once he describes this scene
[40:16] which he as a prophet he's describing it
[40:18] but yet it's not outlined that way in
[40:20] Scripture you're not read not reading
[40:22] from Genesis to 26 or anything like that
[40:25] he's just describing what it must have
[40:27] been like and he makes this statement oh
[40:29] how I'd like to stop here just a minute
[40:31] to say see there is where we are facing
[40:35] yet the completion of that word that's a
[40:39] remarkable statement and it just really
[40:41] grabbed me how he says this he's
[40:43] describing Adam and Eve walking in the
[40:45] garden each seed bringing forth and he
[40:47] says that is what we're facing I want to
[40:49] stop now he says and I want to point out
[40:51] that we right now are facing the
[40:54] completion of that word that word that
[40:57] signified they're in Genesis chapter 2
[40:59] we are facing the fulfillment he says
[41:02] the completion has to bring something to
[41:03] fulfillment we're facing the fulfillment
[41:06] of that word so I want to just expound
[41:09] upon that today on this subject to
[41:12] fulfill in the original because there
[41:14] must be a restoration of
[41:16] the original in order to complete the
[41:18] fridge the original in order to fulfill
[41:21] God's original and ultimate purpose
[41:23] there must be some restoration of these
[41:25] elements of Adam and the woman walking
[41:27] in the garden each seed bringing four
[41:29] and we know that brother branham makes
[41:33] many remarkable statements about purpose
[41:35] and how that God has a purpose for you
[41:38] and Satan cannot take you till God's
[41:40] purposed is finished so yet God's
[41:42] purpose becomes something that's the
[41:44] overriding power over our lives because
[41:47] Satan is unable to touch us until God's
[41:49] purpose is finished and so a purpose is
[41:52] the intention of something or the goal
[41:54] the aim that something has and it's the
[41:57] combination of the prefix pur which is
[41:59] to put forth and pose which is to put or
[42:02] to place so there's a placing you set
[42:05] something forth you place it you
[42:06] positionally put it with an intended
[42:09] design or for it to do something so when
[42:11] you purpose something as a verb you
[42:13] design it in a particular way so the
[42:16] purpose relates to the the intention of
[42:19] something the design of something
[42:20] placing up in a particular position in
[42:23] order for it to accomplish a very
[42:24] specific goal and brother Bram says all
[42:27] at the church only knew its position
[42:29] right he knew what he was putting her
[42:32] forth for if he knew why he was
[42:34] positionally placing her by the word he
[42:36] says it will one day set off she only
[42:38] knew it and Christ is the mystery God
[42:40] revealed that silence lifting from that
[42:42] Seventh Seal oh she only knew her
[42:44] purpose which is revealed under that
[42:46] Seventh Seal she only knew her purpose
[42:48] he says oh she will one day it will one
[42:51] day then the rapture will go when it
[42:53] knows what it is so this is the power in
[42:56] purpose this is the power in
[42:58] understanding our purpose the purpose of
[43:00] God is such a great force one of the
[43:03] most important things his intention his
[43:06] goal and his design even for us and so
[43:10] what we're facing brother Bram says what
[43:12] we're facing is the completion of that
[43:14] word what we're facing today is the
[43:16] fulfillment of God's original purpose
[43:19] we're facing the completion of what God
[43:21] had in his mind from the very very
[43:23] beginning brother Branham says in
[43:26] question and answers the very creator
[43:28] that
[43:28] the earth for a purpose he created the
[43:31] earth for purpose
[43:32] he said Satan defiled him what Satan
[43:35] defiled was the earth and in defiling
[43:37] the earth he interrupted God's plan
[43:39] because he cannot destroy God's purpose
[43:42] but he created the earth for the purpose
[43:45] brother Bentham writes in the church age
[43:46] book the heart purpose the eternal
[43:49] purpose of God was to take a bride of
[43:51] his own choosing and that purpose was in
[43:54] himself and being eternal was decreed
[43:57] before the foundation of the world so
[44:00] God's heart purpose that means his very
[44:02] central purpose the very thing at the
[44:04] very center of God what gave him essence
[44:07] and meaning and purpose of existing was
[44:09] to take a bride of his own choosing
[44:12] but RAM says in the message paradox God
[44:15] made the earth he made it for purpose
[44:17] what are we all here for why did God
[44:19] make the earth he says to take a church
[44:22] out of it a bride says and that's the
[44:24] most important job in the world
[44:27] so when brother BAM said the very
[44:28] creator that created the earth for
[44:30] purpose the very purpose of the earth
[44:32] was to get a bride out of it from the
[44:35] very moment that God formed himself in
[44:37] the logos he was moving himself towards
[44:40] fulfilling this purpose because if you
[44:43] think about it if God did God bless you
[44:44] better Lewis didn't mean to leave your
[44:46] name out I don't know who all the
[44:47] preachers are here so if I left your
[44:48] name out I'm sorry I'm only going by the
[44:50] ones I've met and you can meet me
[44:52] afterwards and set me straight and I'll
[44:54] remember to remember to acknowledge you
[44:56] next time but he God in the very
[45:00] beginning has this purpose in his heart
[45:02] to have a bride of his choosing had he
[45:04] just created a bride she just would have
[45:06] been okay God God and fills all time and
[45:11] space there was nothing else but God and
[45:13] if he just would have created some thing
[45:15] she'd just been there like okay Here I
[45:17] am but God wanted to have a bride of his
[45:20] own choosing so it first forms himself
[45:22] into the logos and from that very moment
[45:24] that God becomes expressed in this logos
[45:26] he's working towards this ultimate
[45:29] desire of having a bride of his choosing
[45:31] so he made the earth for a purpose to
[45:34] get a bride a Bateses and that's the
[45:35] most important job there is in the world
[45:38] he brights in the church age book
[45:41] chapter seven he says first of all we
[45:43] know most assuredly that the purpose of
[45:45] God stands in election it was purposed
[45:49] in himself it was God's purpose so that
[45:52] he says that the purpose of God stands
[45:54] in election he's in it that's a drawing
[45:57] from Romans chapter nine in these
[45:59] different things he says it was purposed
[46:01] in himself
[46:01] it was God's purpose now this is brother
[46:04] branham bringing it down to a very
[46:05] singular goal it was God's purpose to
[46:08] bring forth a people like unto himself
[46:10] that would be a word bride this is God's
[46:14] purpose so then you can see how brother
[46:16] Branham can make a statement that what
[46:18] we're facing today is the completion of
[46:20] that word and when he says that he's
[46:23] pointing to what was happening in
[46:24] Genesis because in Genesis we see the
[46:26] beginning of all things and that's the
[46:28] beginning of God now is expressing his
[46:31] divine purpose and introducing us to his
[46:34] goal of having a bride of his own
[46:36] choosing so if we look back to Genesis
[46:38] we can see God's pattern we could see
[46:41] God's purpose things God's doing to
[46:42] foreshadow his ultimate desire of having
[46:45] a people likened to himself that would
[46:47] be a word bride to have a bride of his
[46:50] own choosing that purpose was in himself
[46:52] I love that a people like unto himself
[46:57] someone co-equal something that had
[46:59] lightness God lightness God equality and
[47:02] so this is I want to begin to look into
[47:05] Genesis because it's the beginning of
[47:07] what we're finishing it's at the
[47:09] beginning of what God is wanting to
[47:11] fulfill and in Genesis not only do you
[47:14] see the beginning of God's purpose being
[47:16] made plain but you also see Satan's
[47:18] attempt to stop it and to fight against
[47:20] it billa Branham says in marriage and
[47:23] divorce Genesis is the seed chapter to
[47:26] every question in the Bible I apologize
[47:28] if I'm going fast and if it seems like
[47:31] I'm going fast I think I'm going even a
[47:32] little bit slower than I normally do I
[47:34] get I get nervous when I preach and then
[47:36] I just preach faster but the bad part is
[47:39] is when the pull when there's no pull
[47:41] and it's really dry that's when you
[47:44] preach your fastest because you just
[47:45] want to get it over with
[47:47] so if I slow down and and go long it's
[47:50] your fault
[47:55] so it says Genesis is the seed chapter 2
[47:58] every question in the Bible and you
[48:00] always have to go back to the seed to
[48:03] see what kind of seed is in the field to
[48:05] find out what your crop will be so this
[48:08] is why we'd go back to Genesis and lose
[48:10] fellowship in it Genesis chapter 1 and
[48:12] chapter 2 and chapter 3 today because
[48:14] it's the scene chapter where the man
[48:16] says it all come up in Genesis it's the
[48:18] seed
[48:19] he says you start in Genesis you get
[48:21] says you'll get your picture straight so
[48:23] if we want to know what we're facing the
[48:25] completion of today you go back to
[48:27] Genesis and you'll get your picture
[48:28] straight we'll know what to expect we'll
[48:30] know what God is doing and so brother
[48:32] Branham is just want to keep repeating
[48:34] this phrase he says there was Adam and
[48:36] Eve walking in the Garden of Eden every
[48:39] seed bringing forth he says there is
[48:41] where we are facing yet the completion
[48:44] of that word so we're facing the
[48:46] completion of something that Adam and
[48:48] the woman did not finish we're facing
[48:50] the fulfilment and the bringing to the
[48:52] climax and the product which God
[48:54] envisioned in the beginning when he sold
[48:56] those seeds in Genesis so Genesis of the
[48:59] seed chapter of every question in the
[49:01] Bible go back to Genesis that's where
[49:03] the seeds were sown so if they were seed
[49:06] sown in Genesis what we're facing today
[49:08] is the perfection and the full harvest
[49:11] of what God showed in the beginning my
[49:14] what an exciting time to be living that
[49:17] even a seed that he sowed in Genesis
[49:20] those intentions he had that are going
[49:22] to come to fruit in this hour and we're
[49:24] going to be the expression of it his
[49:28] brother Branham says there was a
[49:29] three-fold purpose of God manifested in
[49:32] Adam and Eve so he makes that statement
[49:35] there was a three-fold purpose of God we
[49:37] know that the language that he uses to
[49:40] express himself in Christ have premise
[49:42] and the bride restored back to the
[49:44] Garden of Eden will read some statements
[49:46] from Christ as the mystery to expound
[49:48] upon that but he make when he makes this
[49:51] statement the threefold purpose of God
[49:54] manifested in Adam and Eve so his
[49:57] purpose was a mystery that was hidden
[50:00] the very manifestation of the man and
[50:02] the woman the threefold purpose was
[50:04] manifested in Adam and Eve but there was
[50:06] a it was a hidden mystery that a prophet
[50:09] now is bringing out to us and if I could
[50:12] say this the purpose of God is fulfilled
[50:14] or completed by fulfilling what God
[50:17] started in that manifestation of Adam
[50:19] and the woman I says in Christ as the
[50:23] mystery of God revealed what's his
[50:24] threefold purpose because what we're
[50:27] seeing in the manifestation of Adam and
[50:29] the woman God was foreshadowing
[50:31] something there was a type thing because
[50:33] Satan thought he came in marred martyred
[50:36] the whole thing but in doing so Satan
[50:39] only worked right into God's plan to
[50:41] express redemption to express his
[50:44] purpose in his ultimate plan so he says
[50:46] what what's his three-fold purpose
[50:48] manifests himself in Jesus Christ that's
[50:51] the first of the threefold manifest
[50:54] himself in Jesus Christ that expresses
[50:56] the bridegroom that expresses the last
[50:58] Adam and so this is the purpose
[51:01] threefold purpose of Christ to meta name
[51:03] so God wants to manifest himself in
[51:05] Jesus Christ and then to come into the
[51:08] body by Jesus Christ to have the
[51:11] preeminence
[51:12] so by Jesus Christ and if you wanted to
[51:14] even back up and with the the cross of
[51:17] the shedding of blood and the sacrifice
[51:19] of the life brought for us is by the
[51:23] sacrifice of Jesus Christ he can come
[51:25] into the body and have the preeminence
[51:27] and who is the body it is the bride it
[51:30] is the last woman and you can see all
[51:33] these things foreshadowed in Genesis 3
[51:35] and the shedding of blood and even in
[51:37] these things that take place in
[51:38] Scripture and so that's the first fold
[51:40] the second fold have preeminence in the
[51:43] bride to restore back in that's the
[51:47] third part but he has to do this he has
[51:49] to restore back Eden bring back that
[51:51] which lost and that's that's a real good
[51:55] summary statement where Birnbaum is
[51:57] identifying these three parts the
[51:59] threefold purpose of God manifested in
[52:02] Adam and the woman and we see that there
[52:04] was a bridegroom there was a bride and
[52:06] there was a condition that existed them
[52:09] together
[52:10] he says it this way in that sermon
[52:12] now through that the Tree of Life he
[52:15] brings forth the bride tree which will
[52:17] be the Tree of Life restored back to him
[52:19] it's gonna come back to God she says as
[52:21] a husband and wife in the Garden of Eden
[52:24] so now this is God's expression back to
[52:27] husband and wife in the Garden of Eden
[52:29] by the same word in the same God that
[52:32] made manifest in husband and wife the
[52:34] same bride tree back again so we know
[52:37] that the tree of knowledge of good and
[52:39] evil produced Satan's Eden and it
[52:41] brought to pass what we look out in the
[52:43] world today to see the climax of the
[52:45] pinnacle of Satan's plan and Satan's
[52:47] devices and that's come by the way of
[52:50] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[52:51] but now by the tree of life by that he
[52:55] brings forth the bride tree which is The
[52:57] Tree of Life restored back to the
[53:00] expression of a husband wife God made
[53:03] manifest as husband and wife
[53:05] the bride tree back again he says
[53:09] continuing and now on his way back to
[53:12] the original Eden restoring back his
[53:15] bride and fellowship back with God as
[53:17] husband and wife in the Garden of Eden
[53:19] sure Christ and his bride and I'm and
[53:23] I'm just I guess maybe it's
[53:24] cherry-picking or peach picking maybe is
[53:26] what we do here just just to kind of
[53:28] take these statements out where he's
[53:30] identifying that it's back to Eden in
[53:33] the Garden of Eden back to the original
[53:35] Eden in the Garden of Eden this is a
[53:37] language he's using in Christ as the
[53:39] mystery
[53:40] so this mystery that was in the back
[53:42] part of God's mind which is now
[53:44] unfolding to us by the open of the seals
[53:46] which only a prophet could bring it
[53:47] forth he's bringing to us this great
[53:50] mystery this thing's been the back part
[53:52] of God's mind and you were the thought
[53:54] in God's mind because you were the heart
[53:56] purpose so when he preaches Christ as
[53:58] the mystery of God revealed he's not so
[54:00] much just talking about Jesus the man
[54:02] who walked the shores of Galilee but
[54:04] he's actually bringing forth the bride
[54:06] because Christ is the mystery of God
[54:08] revealed the bride is the mystery of God
[54:10] finished and it's always bringing these
[54:13] thoughts to us out of the Garden of Eden
[54:16] because this is where God's plan was
[54:17] first hidden he's there in the Garden of
[54:19] Eden so he says it's a revelation it's
[54:23] as eternal as God's Word is eternal this
[54:25] is still in Christ
[54:26] the mystery look the threefold purpose
[54:29] of God's great mystery is revealed God
[54:34] manifested in Christ Christ manifested
[54:38] in the church in order to redeem the
[54:43] lost Eve back to the original condition
[54:46] in the Garden of Eden so it's not just
[54:50] maybe a location uh with certain
[54:54] amenities and and and maybe a certain
[54:56] landscape or sort of things growing but
[54:59] it's a condition back to the original
[55:02] condition in the garden I mean there was
[55:04] a Garden of Eden condition that God has
[55:06] to restore back to you
[55:07] so in fulfilling the original there has
[55:11] to be a manifestation of the full
[55:14] maturity of the original spoken word and
[55:17] that spoken word seed which was sown in
[55:20] the beginning because you got to have to
[55:22] fulfill this purpose right so when we
[55:25] see when even when we believe and we
[55:27] hear it taught that this message is
[55:30] restoring us it's a restoration and it's
[55:32] a restoration back to go back to the
[55:35] original it's a restoration of that
[55:37] image and that condition that existed in
[55:39] the Garden of Eden
[55:40] because when brother Branham was
[55:42] restoring us back and this is a
[55:43] restoration message it's not just back
[55:46] to Pentecost and even back to what that
[55:49] first church was in the beginning but
[55:51] it's actually fulfilling the purpose of
[55:54] what that first church was for and we
[55:56] will get into that perhaps later as we
[55:58] continue today is this was this is
[56:01] actually this message restored just all
[56:03] the way back to the very beginning of
[56:04] the Garden of Eden
[56:07] that's what this message restores us
[56:09] back to an image and a condition that is
[56:11] expressed in the Garden of Eden now and
[56:16] it's wonderful to be able to minister to
[56:17] people who are taught well because you
[56:19] don't feel like you have to read a dozen
[56:21] quotes just to substantiate what you're
[56:23] saying so I can make this statement and
[56:25] and know that you'll just pick right up
[56:27] where brother Ben taught these things
[56:29] but the first masterpiece was adamant
[56:32] the woman in a perfect Eden brother man
[56:35] have called it a masterpiece family so
[56:38] the it's important to understand this
[56:39] part the first masterpiece was not Adam
[56:42] it was Adam and the woman the first
[56:45] masterpiece was a family brother man it
[56:48] says in the masterpiece for nearly 2,000
[56:50] years God has been making him a
[56:52] masterpiece
[56:53] he says he struck Adam so now he's
[56:57] pointing us to what's happened in this
[56:58] hour because that's what we're facing
[57:00] yet today the completion of that word
[57:02] and so there's something that that word
[57:04] signified a represented so he says he
[57:06] struck Adam to get a part of him a rib
[57:09] to make a wife for him and now that
[57:11] perfect masterpiece that he struck at
[57:13] Calvary he got a piece off of him so the
[57:16] the image that brother Brandon brings up
[57:18] before us is that here at first was Adam
[57:20] and that he took a piece of Adam and
[57:22] made the woman and that was a
[57:24] masterpiece then he raised up Jesus
[57:27] Christ who is the last Adam and then he
[57:29] takes a piece also off of him and that
[57:31] is to be the bride and now you have the
[57:33] masterpiece coming into expression again
[57:37] so in it's wonderful language he says
[57:40] he's got a piece off of him it's just
[57:42] the New Testament that's all well if I'm
[57:46] gonna be at that's all that's all I want
[57:47] to be it's just the New Testament so
[57:51] there's this is a great mystery because
[57:53] now the bride is the fulfillment of the
[57:55] New Testament he says he fulfilled the
[57:57] Old Testament now it's the New Testament
[58:00] another piece to be fulfilled
[58:03] it's important to understand the Old
[58:06] Testament contained prophecy that has
[58:08] expressed perfectly in Jesus Christ and
[58:11] now the New Testament language contains
[58:13] prophecy that is expressed in you they
[58:18] look at Old Testament New Testament they
[58:19] say well that's it this is the complete
[58:21] word but the Old Testament was made
[58:23] perfect in the flesh of Jesus Christ now
[58:25] the New Testaments made perfect in your
[58:27] flesh he goes see the new and the old is
[58:31] husband and wife and it take it took the
[58:35] old to foreshadow the new Christ come to
[58:38] masterpiece to fulfill that the old now
[58:41] his bride and this is really maybe a
[58:43] thesis of what I'm trying to share today
[58:45] now his bride will fulfill everything
[58:48] that's in the New Testament another
[58:51] masterpiece isn't making a lot because
[58:54] you have the bridegroom revealed to the
[58:56] bride in order to have a masterpiece in
[58:59] the making there has to be an expression
[59:01] of a perfect bridegroom and there has to
[59:04] be an expression of a bride that's been
[59:06] brought face to face with that
[59:07] bridegroom because in the beginning he
[59:10] brought her unto the man so there has to
[59:12] be a coming together in a recognition
[59:15] and an acknowledgement of the bridegroom
[59:17] and the bride to come back to a
[59:18] completion and the bride will fulfill
[59:21] everything that's in the New Testament
[59:24] says another masterpiece isn't making so
[59:29] the bride fulfills all the hope all the
[59:32] promise and all the potential of the
[59:34] original New Testament church this
[59:38] message and I share this with with great
[59:41] caution and take great care with my
[59:43] words because I'm in no way trying to
[59:45] talk down on anything that God has done
[59:47] this message restores us back to the
[59:50] faith of our Pentecostal fathers it
[59:52] restores us back to that Pentecost in
[59:55] order to achieve what that one didn't
[59:59] and I say that with great care because I
[1:00:02] wouldn't want to disparage at all but if
[1:00:05] we have time to get into this brother
[1:00:06] BAM teaches very plainly that all the
[1:00:08] promise and all the potential and what
[1:00:10] that church stood for the glory that
[1:00:13] could have come from her it didn't
[1:00:15] because Satan's work
[1:00:16] against it and defiled it but we are
[1:00:21] predestinated to not fall out so brother
[1:00:28] so you could take these images of the
[1:00:30] original woman in the original Church
[1:00:31] and begin to see how brother Bentham is
[1:00:35] expressing this in the masterpiece he
[1:00:36] says Michelangelo could not reproduce
[1:00:39] that again now as he's describing Moses
[1:00:41] and this is a great a piece of art that
[1:00:45] it was chiseled out of stone and as he
[1:00:48] struck that the knee there of Moses and
[1:00:51] told it to speak and that piece broke
[1:00:53] off he said he couldn't he couldn't
[1:00:55] reproduce that work he could replicate
[1:00:58] it he could maybe try to do another one
[1:01:00] but that one could never be restored
[1:01:02] says he could not put it back but God is
[1:01:06] going to do it he is going to bring this
[1:01:09] little bride that smitten right back to
[1:01:12] the side of the original word now that
[1:01:15] to me implies that there's a union that
[1:01:18] takes place during whatever has been
[1:01:21] ripped apart whatever has been torn
[1:01:24] whatever has been rented it's brought
[1:01:25] back into perfection again he says and
[1:01:28] there he is
[1:01:29] there's the masterpiece the family back
[1:01:32] in the Garden of Eden says how is this
[1:01:35] bride going to do this how is this week
[1:01:37] going to do this Malachi 4 said in the
[1:01:40] last days it would be restored back
[1:01:42] restored back like the beginning
[1:01:45] whatever was lost through the fall is
[1:01:48] brought back whatever was expressed and
[1:01:50] the man and the woman God's going to be
[1:01:52] stored back because God's going to put
[1:01:54] that family back together again I'm
[1:01:56] gonna take this little bride though
[1:01:58] she's smitten it's gonna be right back
[1:02:00] to the side of the original word he says
[1:02:05] this in Satan's Eden says having faith
[1:02:08] in all his word his seeds he speaking of
[1:02:12] God brought an Eden of holiness love and
[1:02:15] eternal life so God had faith in his own
[1:02:19] word why because he's not gonna ask you
[1:02:21] to do something that he hasn't done
[1:02:23] already God practices what he preaches
[1:02:26] and so in order for the word seemed to
[1:02:28] bring forth God had to have faith in his
[1:02:30] own word so when he tells you to believe
[1:02:32] his word he's telling you to do what
[1:02:33] he's already done and look what it did
[1:02:36] for him it can do the same thing for you
[1:02:39] God with faith in his own word seed it
[1:02:42] brought forth and Eden of holiness and
[1:02:44] love and eternal life he says that's
[1:02:46] what God's Eden produced holiness and it
[1:02:51] brought an Eden of holiness of love
[1:02:53] understanding perfection and eternal
[1:02:57] life brother Branham described how they
[1:02:59] had perfect love around him no death
[1:03:01] around him describes his perfection
[1:03:03] there in Eden he says that's what God is
[1:03:06] planting his word his seed that's what
[1:03:11] his church will be at the end it will be
[1:03:13] the same thing now brother Branham has
[1:03:18] has connected the condition of the
[1:03:21] Garden of Eden the holiness the love the
[1:03:24] eternal life the understanding the
[1:03:26] perfection he's connected it with the
[1:03:28] what the bride will be now so he's
[1:03:33] connected what the bride is now to the
[1:03:35] original condition in the Garden of Eden
[1:03:37] why because this word is to restore us
[1:03:40] back to the condition of the Garden of
[1:03:42] Eden
[1:03:43] so while he's preaching Satan's Eden
[1:03:45] he's describing God's original Eden and
[1:03:48] how that God has already sold a word
[1:03:50] seed that Satan's Eden could not destroy
[1:03:53] and God will in the midst of sayings
[1:03:56] Eden restored back the image of what was
[1:03:59] in God's originally praise the Lord he
[1:04:03] says that's what the bride the church
[1:04:04] will be at the end she'll be the same
[1:04:06] thing that that garden was holy perfect
[1:04:10] having understanding holiness the bride
[1:04:14] that will be a manifestation of his
[1:04:16] planting because he says this is God
[1:04:19] this is what God is planting there's
[1:04:21] gonna be holiness love understanding
[1:04:23] perfection no death around her at all so
[1:04:29] there's there's an image that's
[1:04:30] expressed in this original garden that
[1:04:32] God plants that signifies and represents
[1:04:36] the bride so if you look at Genesis
[1:04:39] chapter
[1:04:41] and in verse seven he's formed the man
[1:04:44] now he hasn't created him again but he
[1:04:47] first makes him supernatural spiritual
[1:04:49] which is in the image of God and in
[1:04:51] verse seven he actually forms him not
[1:04:53] creating forms a body that he puts this
[1:04:56] man I had quickens him to life in this
[1:04:59] whole body now becomes through that
[1:05:01] quickening this this this flesh which
[1:05:03] came from the dirt it becomes one person
[1:05:06] body spirit soul another it becomes a
[1:05:09] living soul the soul in man living
[1:05:11] animating spirit animating body and this
[1:05:14] is of the perfect man here is Adam in
[1:05:17] the beginning Ana the very next
[1:05:19] statement is verse eight Genesis chapter
[1:05:21] 2 verse 8 and the Lord God planted a
[1:05:25] garden eastward in Eden and there he put
[1:05:29] the man whom he had formed now this is a
[1:05:32] beautiful beautiful picture God God has
[1:05:34] in this verse just laid out his plan of
[1:05:37] redemption and his plan even up to the
[1:05:40] very end and I hope just to amplify this
[1:05:42] for the remainder of our time this
[1:05:44] morning and then whatever I do in the
[1:05:47] afternoon beginning at noon we might
[1:05:48] just change change the subject but it
[1:05:52] and that doesn't mean I'm gonna finish
[1:05:53] this morning I would just continue under
[1:05:55] the evening or maybe and while to do
[1:05:58] that we'd have to preach a long time
[1:05:59] because the next service starts at 2:00
[1:06:01] I'm mindful of them but he's laying
[1:06:05] something out here which is quite
[1:06:06] remarkable now the man is perfectly
[1:06:09] expressed and then he says the Lord God
[1:06:11] planted a garden eastward in Eden this
[1:06:14] threefold purpose manifested in the man
[1:06:16] of the woman so now you have the man and
[1:06:19] now you have the garden but this garden
[1:06:21] represents something because it isn't
[1:06:23] there he put the man he had formed and
[1:06:26] God is foreshadowing something about
[1:06:28] this endtime he says the Lord God
[1:06:31] planted a garden eastward that means in
[1:06:33] the beginning so it's not so much a
[1:06:36] geographical location well that's in the
[1:06:38] East part of Eden but also means
[1:06:40] symbolically and literally that God had
[1:06:42] planted a garden already at the
[1:06:44] beginning of
[1:06:45] so when God formed Eden at the beginning
[1:06:48] he had planted a garden when he formed
[1:06:51] Eden there was already a seeds have been
[1:06:54] sown of a garden and Eden means his
[1:06:56] delight so God had planted a garden
[1:06:59] eastward at the beginning Eden so in his
[1:07:02] delight there was a garden that he had
[1:07:03] formed he had planted and brother Bram
[1:07:06] says when Adam and Eve had their
[1:07:07] children in Eden he says not in the
[1:07:11] Garden of Eden
[1:07:12] because they've been driven out of the
[1:07:14] Garden of Eden but they were still in
[1:07:17] Eden and the Garden of Eden laid east in
[1:07:20] in so this was something special that
[1:07:26] God had planted in the garden or planted
[1:07:29] in Eden this was a special place in Eden
[1:07:32] so that Adam and Eve after the fall
[1:07:35] before the fall it's Adam and the woman
[1:07:37] after the fall it's Adam and Eve and so
[1:07:41] because if we were living in a perfect
[1:07:43] condition the bathrooms that say Adam
[1:07:46] and woman but since we're in the fall to
[1:07:49] have the faults Adam and Eve hey does it
[1:07:54] says this in a number of different
[1:07:55] places and not just in this one instance
[1:07:56] where he's identifying the Garden of
[1:08:00] Eden as a special place within Eden this
[1:08:04] is something that God had planted a
[1:08:06] garden this is very specific
[1:08:08] God plants a garden eastward in Eden
[1:08:12] Reverend says there was a Garden of Eden
[1:08:14] that laid East in Eden someplace special
[1:08:17] now brother Adam says it this way in
[1:08:20] Satan's Eden when he got it all made
[1:08:22] finally arrived with its headquarters of
[1:08:24] the earth and a beautiful spot lane East
[1:08:27] of Eden
[1:08:28] called the Garden of Eden so it was a
[1:08:30] Garden God made the world headquarters
[1:08:33] in the Garden of Eden in Egypt right at
[1:08:35] the at the east end of the garden was
[1:08:37] the headquarters and over the whole
[1:08:39] situation
[1:08:40] now he's describing this Garden of Eden
[1:08:41] condition he put his son and his son's
[1:08:44] wife over all of it and when he's
[1:08:47] preaching Satan's Eden marriage and
[1:08:49] divorce and godless evil age he he says
[1:08:51] some very strong things about the woman
[1:08:53] and the fallen woman but he also says
[1:08:56] that in the beginning the woman
[1:08:58] and the man were coequal and he says he
[1:09:01] put his son and his son's wife over all
[1:09:04] of it so and when he establishes this
[1:09:07] Dominion he's not saying that Adam had
[1:09:09] this dominion over the woman we find
[1:09:11] that the rule that he has over here
[1:09:13] comes after the fall and there and then
[1:09:15] needed that because even the woman had
[1:09:18] to be told now your desire has to be to
[1:09:20] your husband before it didn't have to be
[1:09:22] told there was a perfect love that they
[1:09:24] had one for the other he says he put his
[1:09:27] son and his son's wife over all of it
[1:09:29] that's what God did he put them in full
[1:09:32] control they could speak to the winds
[1:09:35] and it would cease to blow they could
[1:09:37] speak to the tree and it would move from
[1:09:39] here to there think about what this
[1:09:41] message is trying to bring us to not to
[1:09:43] a place we say Oh God do this oh God do
[1:09:46] that but when you speak that's the power
[1:09:50] of the third Pole when you speak that's
[1:09:53] what this message is trying to bring us
[1:09:54] to where the bride has thus saith the
[1:09:56] Lord where she speaks the word she it's
[1:10:00] God fulfilling his word the way he wants
[1:10:02] to do it and he does it for you as you
[1:10:06] think about Adam there at the beginning
[1:10:07] and the woman brother Graham is saying
[1:10:09] that they put it in their control where
[1:10:11] they could speak and brother Branham at
[1:10:13] the end is trying to declare that the
[1:10:15] bride she must speak it's not even all
[1:10:17] honey
[1:10:17] oh dear would you do this but now it's
[1:10:19] the bride could speak and that's exactly
[1:10:22] what brother Branham is manifested in
[1:10:24] those five temporary manifestations of
[1:10:26] the third pole and there's one that
[1:10:28] stands out to me is very extraordinary
[1:10:30] when he created those squirrels he
[1:10:32] didn't say in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:33] Christ he didn't call it upon the Lord
[1:10:35] he just said let there be and there was
[1:10:38] and that would perfectly Express Adam
[1:10:41] and the woman there at the very
[1:10:43] beginning Adam didn't say in the name of
[1:10:45] the Lord Jesus Christ and the power
[1:10:47] given to me by God Adam just spoke it
[1:10:49] and said move here do this and do that
[1:10:51] and it did it and now here's a prophet
[1:10:54] standing there in the wilderness
[1:10:55] speaking the word and by his own
[1:10:57] authority it comes to be what is it
[1:11:00] that's God speaking
[1:11:07] I don't say this to embarrass anybody
[1:11:10] but it's amazing how people can sleep
[1:11:12] why somebody's screaming young people
[1:11:20] these days right those earbuds have just
[1:11:23] they they they it's in their ears they
[1:11:24] reduce their hearing down to a preacher
[1:11:26] can just scream his lungs out and they
[1:11:28] don't hear it maybe we should pass out
[1:11:30] earbuds he says he put them in full
[1:11:36] control they could speak to the winds
[1:11:37] and it would cease to blow they would
[1:11:39] speak to the tree and it would move from
[1:11:40] here to there the lion and the wolf fed
[1:11:43] together and the lamb laid down with
[1:11:44] them there was no evil it was perfect
[1:11:47] peace perfect harmony everything in
[1:11:50] perfection and when God had it under his
[1:11:52] control he had his world he had it all
[1:11:54] in operation he had everything coming
[1:11:56] this is the word that began this is what
[1:11:59] God loved this is a this is the world
[1:12:01] that God loved this is what God looked
[1:12:03] to and and thought was so wonderful and
[1:12:05] then saying this now and I may be
[1:12:07] getting it in a little bit what I want
[1:12:08] to get to later when the Bible says for
[1:12:11] God so loved the world this is the world
[1:12:13] God loved because that's what he sent
[1:12:16] his son to redeem is this world not the
[1:12:18] cosmos we see around today but this is
[1:12:21] the world God loved and it's the way you
[1:12:24] resolve the paradoxes the Bible says if
[1:12:25] you love the world and the things of
[1:12:27] this world the love of the father's not
[1:12:28] in him so when you have to understand
[1:12:31] the world that God loved this is the
[1:12:33] world that God loved for God so loved
[1:12:34] this world that He gave His only
[1:12:35] begotten Son to redeem this world but if
[1:12:38] you love that world then the love of the
[1:12:40] father's not in you perfect everything's
[1:12:45] perfect had everything under control
[1:12:46] everything eating eating vegetations
[1:12:49] nothing to die nothing to be ruined
[1:12:50] nothing to be spoiled it was just
[1:12:52] perfect and over all of it he placed his
[1:12:55] beloved children his son and his
[1:12:58] daughter a husband and wife to control
[1:13:02] it this is this is how brother Branham
[1:13:06] describes the word that we're completing
[1:13:08] God is foreshadowing the bride of the
[1:13:11] perfect Eden God's foreshadowing what
[1:13:15] his ultimate desired objective is and in
[1:13:17] this very language that God uses in the
[1:13:20] the Lord God planted a garden in Eden
[1:13:22] the word garden is figurative of a
[1:13:25] spouse it is figurative of a Brian
[1:13:28] because it says the Tree of Life was
[1:13:30] also in the midst of the garden brother
[1:13:33] Benson's gonna be by that tree of life
[1:13:34] when this bride comes back it brings
[1:13:36] back the tree of life again and so
[1:13:39] there's a tree of life also in the midst
[1:13:41] of a garden he says in verse 10 and the
[1:13:43] river went out of Eden to water the
[1:13:45] garden so you can see that this garden
[1:13:47] is figure to them even the bride the
[1:13:49] Tree of Life and the midst of her and
[1:13:51] how even the river of life running
[1:13:53] running to it to water the garden and
[1:13:55] you see these very things expressed in
[1:13:57] Revelations at the end in this New
[1:13:59] Jerusalem which is the bride because
[1:14:03] what does brother branham teach us we
[1:14:05] know the future home they're described
[1:14:07] in Revelations 21 in those places how
[1:14:09] it's describing the New Jerusalem of
[1:14:11] future city but it's first expressed in
[1:14:14] you because brother Brennan says when a
[1:14:17] man chooses a woman he's choosing her
[1:14:20] based upon what he wants his future home
[1:14:23] to be so the choice of a wife reveals
[1:14:26] what the future home will be when a man
[1:14:29] chooses the woman she holds the mystery
[1:14:31] of the future home when God chose the
[1:14:33] bride she is the revelation of the
[1:14:36] mystery of the future home
[1:14:37] you hold that so you're the first
[1:14:41] expression of that New Jerusalem the
[1:14:44] City of God and that's why there's maybe
[1:14:46] John said I'd you want to see the Lambs
[1:14:48] wife and he's shown a city then he's
[1:14:51] gonna see the city and he and he just he
[1:14:53] sees the Lambs wife what is it he the
[1:14:54] way he's described it's the same thing
[1:14:56] first expressed in the flesh of God's
[1:14:58] people his bride and so this garden is
[1:15:01] represents the bride in the very
[1:15:03] beginning when he speaks he planted a
[1:15:05] garden eastward in Eden Eden and there
[1:15:07] he put the man he had formed he's
[1:15:09] actually foreshadowing you I want to
[1:15:16] look at Scripture Hosea chapter 2 verse
[1:15:17] 23 we're identifying what was being
[1:15:21] foreshadowed in the garden this hidden
[1:15:22] mystery the completion the word that
[1:15:25] we're facing the completion of and Hosea
[1:15:28] at 2:23 there's a great mystery hidden
[1:15:30] this I will sow her unto me
[1:15:33] the earth this is a mister of the
[1:15:36] Gentile bride he says I'll have mercy
[1:15:39] upon her that had not obtained a mercy
[1:15:41] and I will say to them which were not my
[1:15:43] people thou art my people and they shall
[1:15:45] say thou art my god so this is actually
[1:15:48] Hosea 2:23 is a prophecy of a Gentile
[1:15:51] Briony the body of Christ which we be
[1:15:53] made up of Gentiles who were not a
[1:15:55] people of God before regardez heathens
[1:15:58] and reprobates and people of no promise
[1:16:00] and and but God had identified himself
[1:16:02] with Israel and they were the God of
[1:16:03] Israel he was the God of Israel they
[1:16:06] were the people of God the children of
[1:16:07] God but now he prophesized that a people
[1:16:10] that before he had not had mercy on
[1:16:11] people that were not his people before
[1:16:14] he was going to reveal that they were in
[1:16:16] fact his people I never say that weren't
[1:16:18] my god and it all begins with the seed I
[1:16:21] will sow her unto me in the earth the
[1:16:26] Lord planted a bride at the beginning of
[1:16:29] Eden before say never got to the woman
[1:16:33] God had already planted the bride I will
[1:16:37] sow her a bride a body for me unto me in
[1:16:41] the earth it's already there just as you
[1:16:44] said the Lord planted a garden at the
[1:16:46] beginning of Eden I will saw her under
[1:16:48] me and the earth here's the seed already
[1:16:50] started the beginning everything sown by
[1:16:52] the spoken word all seeds were sown in
[1:16:54] Genesis brother mem says and he's
[1:16:56] planted a bride in the beginning and he
[1:16:58] gets to foreshadow that bride through
[1:17:00] this garden Song of Solomon chapter 4
[1:17:03] verses 12 to 16 says the garden enclosed
[1:17:06] is my sister my spouse the garden
[1:17:10] indicates a wife it's a spouse a spring
[1:17:13] shut up a fountain sealed my plants are
[1:17:16] an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant
[1:17:18] fruits Kemp fire was spikenard Spiker
[1:17:20] and saffron calamus and cinnamon with
[1:17:23] all trees of frankincense myrrh and
[1:17:24] aloes with all the chief spices a
[1:17:27] fountain of gardens a well of living
[1:17:29] waters but the tree of life is in the
[1:17:32] midst of the garden a Rivard way out of
[1:17:33] Eden to water the garden he's describing
[1:17:35] these things the continuity of
[1:17:37] scriptures beautiful and streams from
[1:17:40] Lebanon verse 16 awake o north wind and
[1:17:43] come thy south blow upon my god
[1:17:45] that the spices thereof may flow out so
[1:17:48] this is this is now the word coming to
[1:17:50] the bride let let her fruit be known let
[1:17:52] it be expressed and then the bride
[1:17:54] speaks now she says let my beloved come
[1:17:57] into his garden and eat his Pleasant
[1:17:59] fruits so now you have a garden which is
[1:18:03] the spouse but now he's won the the
[1:18:05] brightest income Lord coming to your
[1:18:08] garden and in Chapter five it begins as
[1:18:10] the scripture continues verse one I am
[1:18:12] come into my garden my sister my spouse
[1:18:16] why is it my sister this is bone in my
[1:18:18] boat flesh of my flesh
[1:18:20] it's another description of what
[1:18:23] happened in the Garden of Eden the Lord
[1:18:24] planned to the garden the beginning of
[1:18:26] Eden and there he put the man he had
[1:18:27] formed but now prophecies going forth
[1:18:30] about the bride oh my sister my spouse
[1:18:32] you're a beautiful garden and the
[1:18:34] Brice's let my beloved come into his
[1:18:37] garden he says I am come into my spouse
[1:18:40] I've gathered my myrrh with my spice
[1:18:43] I've eaten my honeycomb with my honey
[1:18:44] I've drunk my wine with my milk eat o
[1:18:47] friends drink a drink abundantly Oh
[1:18:49] beloved this is a fellowship this is
[1:18:54] this is a feast this is the bride's
[1:18:57] secret feast
[1:18:58] I believe the sister sang a song about
[1:19:00] Esther and you know that Esther there
[1:19:03] here's a in the end almost a reverse
[1:19:06] type here's a Jew named
[1:19:08] Hadassah myrtle tree roots earthbound
[1:19:12] and she's raised up to be Esther a star
[1:19:15] married to a Gentile King it's a mirror
[1:19:19] image of this bride this Gentile bride
[1:19:21] who begins earthbound but it's raised up
[1:19:23] to be a star to be a queen married to
[1:19:26] the bride of the Jesus Christ the
[1:19:28] bridegroom and it what is it that Esther
[1:19:31] doesn't that time she's called to the
[1:19:32] kingdom for purpose what does she call a
[1:19:34] feast and her and her husband feast in
[1:19:37] the presence of her enemies
[1:19:40] very one is instigating this conspiracy
[1:19:43] against the Jews against her people and
[1:19:46] here we can see foreshadowed this
[1:19:49] prophecy of the bride's feast Song of
[1:19:51] Solomon
[1:19:51] I'll come into my garden mice and he
[1:19:54] says I am coming to my garden wife
[1:19:56] husband and now the feasting begins she
[1:19:59] says Oh drink abundantly my beloved Oh
[1:20:01] drink and joy and joy your creation and
[1:20:07] says in Genesis chapter 2 verse 15 and
[1:20:09] Lord God took the man and put him into
[1:20:12] the Garden of Eden to dress it and to
[1:20:15] keep it listen I hope you're putting the
[1:20:18] pieces together yourself this is exactly
[1:20:21] what's happened in this end time just as
[1:20:24] though he had planted this garden now he
[1:20:26] puts the man in the midst of the garden
[1:20:28] to dress it and to keep it so that it
[1:20:30] will bring forth fruit to perfection
[1:20:32] so that it she'll fit shall fulfill her
[1:20:35] purpose
[1:20:36] and as they at 27 verses 2 to 3 in that
[1:20:39] day sing ye unto her a vineyard of red
[1:20:42] wine so here's the song to her this is a
[1:20:45] why she's a vineyard she's a planting of
[1:20:47] the Lord
[1:20:47] a vineyard of red wine she's fooled the
[1:20:49] stimulation of Revelation oh what a
[1:20:52] beautiful prophecy of the bride in that
[1:20:54] day singing to her a vineyard a planting
[1:20:57] of the Lord the garden of the Lord hide
[1:21:00] the Lord to keep it I will water it
[1:21:03] every moment less teeny hurt it I will
[1:21:05] keep it night and day I will come into
[1:21:09] the midst of her I will water it I will
[1:21:12] dress it I will keep it that she might
[1:21:14] bring forth fruit to perfection to bring
[1:21:17] the full manifestation my purpose it
[1:21:20] will serve its purpose just as he put
[1:21:24] the man in the garden to dress it and to
[1:21:25] keep it God prop the sign of you I the
[1:21:28] Lord will keep it in water at every
[1:21:29] moment
[1:21:30] lest any hurt it I will keep it night
[1:21:32] and day this is very mystery that Paul
[1:21:36] picks up on an Ephesians chapter 5
[1:21:38] verses 25 to 32 husbands love your wives
[1:21:43] even as Christ also loved the church and
[1:21:46] gave himself for it that he might
[1:21:49] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:21:52] of water by the word
[1:21:54] this is the language now he's using to
[1:21:58] sanctify and de cleanse I the Lord do
[1:22:01] keep it watered every morning the man
[1:22:03] was put in the midst of the garden to
[1:22:05] dress it and to keep it that he might
[1:22:08] present it to himself a glorious church
[1:22:11] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:22:13] thing but that it should be holy and
[1:22:15] without blemish and whose job is that
[1:22:18] the husband's say says so ought men to
[1:22:22] love their wives as their own bodies he
[1:22:25] that loveth his wife loveth himself for
[1:22:28] no man ever yet hated his own flesh but
[1:22:31] nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the
[1:22:34] Lord the church and he realized in that
[1:22:37] statement he's perfectly referring to
[1:22:39] Adam in Christ because in those two in
[1:22:43] there their wives they were their flesh
[1:22:47] so he says no man ever yet hated his own
[1:22:49] flesh that's Adam who when his wife
[1:22:52] sinned he didn't hate his own flesh but
[1:22:55] he acted quickly under one marriage
[1:22:56] covenant not a double covenant but under
[1:22:58] the original marriage coming to acted to
[1:23:00] restore her and redeem her because he
[1:23:03] didn't hate his own flesh she was bone
[1:23:06] of his bone flesh of his flesh and now
[1:23:08] Christ the same with his wife which was
[1:23:10] fathered he does not put her away and
[1:23:12] start over but he works to redeem her
[1:23:14] because those are that's the first man
[1:23:17] in the last man and no man the first nor
[1:23:20] the last ever hated his own flesh why
[1:23:22] because his wife was his own flesh it's
[1:23:26] beautiful and you were commanded as a
[1:23:28] man to love your wife that way says for
[1:23:34] we are members of his body of his flesh
[1:23:35] and of his bones think of the language
[1:23:38] he's describing hi in the very beginning
[1:23:40] Adam says this is bone of my bone flesh
[1:23:42] of my flesh and now he's saying that we
[1:23:45] are members of his body of his flesh and
[1:23:47] of his bones he's drawing from the
[1:23:49] original marriage covenant he's drawing
[1:23:50] from this original proclamation of Adam
[1:23:52] and the woman was brought to the man
[1:23:54] see now quotes almost verbatim from
[1:23:56] Genesis 2 for this cause shall a man
[1:23:59] leave his father and mother and shall be
[1:24:01] joined under his wife and they two shall
[1:24:03] be one flesh
[1:24:06] it's remarkable how the statement is
[1:24:11] made by Beth's prophecy and in it it
[1:24:14] expresses the perfect masterpiece family
[1:24:17] he says for this cause shall a man leave
[1:24:18] father and mother even though now all
[1:24:21] you have expressed as man and woman it
[1:24:23] expresses the purpose of the divine that
[1:24:25] the seed must come forth and as he
[1:24:29] described this a man shall leave his
[1:24:31] father and mother shall be joined and
[1:24:33] his wife and they too shall be one flesh
[1:24:35] we see the image then the perfect
[1:24:36] expression of God how he desired not
[1:24:39] just to have a family but to become a
[1:24:41] family
[1:24:41] he said God loved fatherhood they said
[1:24:45] to become a father he had to become the
[1:24:47] son of man so if God wanted to be a
[1:24:49] daddy he had to become a son and so in
[1:24:52] order to be a husband he had to become a
[1:24:54] wife is the expression of God and he
[1:24:59] says the two shall be one flesh
[1:25:01] that means the husband is expressed in
[1:25:03] Christ now Christ is invisibly United to
[1:25:05] his bride and the two become one flesh
[1:25:09] he says this is a great mystery but I
[1:25:12] speak concerning Christ and the church
[1:25:15] I'm not talking about the men and a wife
[1:25:17] because that would be a mystery how a
[1:25:19] man Here I am I'm here with my wife and
[1:25:21] I believe we're one flesh but yet you
[1:25:23] can say there's Aaron there's Elizabeth
[1:25:24] and then we just have these all right
[1:25:27] whether it's mental gymnastics or
[1:25:29] whatever it is we just somehow imagine
[1:25:30] them as one flesh and there wasn't flesh
[1:25:32] even though there - and maybe that's the
[1:25:35] mystery with the great mystery there
[1:25:37] though is the oneness of Christ and the
[1:25:39] bride and this invisible unit where
[1:25:43] they're going to come back into perfect
[1:25:44] harmony again and I'm not sure how far
[1:25:46] I'll get tonight and I don't mind maybe
[1:25:48] mission in it now this afternoon as we
[1:25:50] come to the services afternoon we know
[1:25:52] this union that's coming together if
[1:25:54] something that brother Branham says was
[1:25:56] incomplete in the garden and incomplete
[1:25:58] in the first church but we're now
[1:26:00] fulfilling the original
[1:26:02] it's now complete this is a great
[1:26:05] mystery he says concerning Christ and
[1:26:07] his bride
[1:26:07] what's a mystery then becomes fulfilled
[1:26:09] now it's not just the mystery built it's
[1:26:12] the finished mystery why because it's in
[1:26:15] this last days the mystery of God is
[1:26:17] finished so Paul is preaching from his
[1:26:24] revelation of the mystery in the Garden
[1:26:25] of Eden and when he instructs husbands
[1:26:28] to love their wives he's drawn from
[1:26:29] Genesis chapter 2 so he's preaching from
[1:26:32] his revelation of this mystery in the
[1:26:33] garden the original three fold purpose
[1:26:36] of the of Adam and the woman and brother
[1:26:39] ben says there is where we're facing yet
[1:26:41] the completion of that word what a
[1:26:45] brother Bram say about Paul's revelation
[1:26:46] his revelation then was prophecy for
[1:26:49] today so what brother Branham preached
[1:26:52] the same gospel Paul preached amen every
[1:26:56] bit but he also brings the fulfillment
[1:26:59] of what Paul preached because brother
[1:27:02] Branham when he preaches the same gospel
[1:27:04] Paul preached he's just not repeating
[1:27:07] what Paul preached you could almost say
[1:27:10] in one sense up to the time he has that
[1:27:11] vision of going beyond the curtain of
[1:27:13] time there before they opened the seals
[1:27:16] and I can't remember now if it was 61 or
[1:27:18] what the exact date was when he gives
[1:27:19] that and I apologize for not being a
[1:27:21] perfect student of the word but when he
[1:27:24] gives that when he gives that
[1:27:25] declaration going on beyond the curtain
[1:27:27] of time and he expresses these things he
[1:27:29] says and he says then I will Paul be
[1:27:32] judged he says yeah he'll be judged as
[1:27:34] this people says I preached the same
[1:27:35] gospel Paul preached so he's preaching
[1:27:38] the same gospel but now at the open of
[1:27:41] the word he's no longer repeating but
[1:27:44] it's fulfilling he's actually bringing
[1:27:47] to pass what Paul would Paul saw and
[1:27:50] desired to see come to pass because
[1:27:52] listen Paul wrote to the Hebrews and
[1:27:54] said I started talking about Melchizedek
[1:27:55] and he goes you know what there's a lot
[1:27:57] of things I want to say about
[1:27:58] Melchizedek but I can't say it because
[1:28:01] you become like children again and you
[1:28:03] should be teachers but you become like
[1:28:04] children need to be taught again
[1:28:06] you can't endure this strong meat so the
[1:28:08] things I want to say about Melchizedek I
[1:28:10] can't say brother branham came along so
[1:28:12] I'll just take the who is this
[1:28:13] Melchizedek and I'll preach it at the
[1:28:15] end time
[1:28:16] the things even Paul couldn't speak part
[1:28:20] of Paul's gospel that remained prophecy
[1:28:22] or mystery this message today is the
[1:28:24] fulfillment of Paul's revelation in
[1:28:26] prophecy and so to be completing the
[1:28:31] original fulfilling what that word
[1:28:34] represented this restoration back to
[1:28:37] Eden will try to end on this thought
[1:28:39] here this restoration back to the
[1:28:41] original requires the full manifestation
[1:28:42] of the bride whereas it says and in the
[1:28:47] midst of the garden there he planted a
[1:28:49] garden and now this garden represents a
[1:28:52] wife then we see there in in Song of
[1:28:56] Solomon and Isaiah and Ephesians 5 the
[1:28:58] dress in the keeping the sanctifying the
[1:28:59] cleansing him is a husbandman keeping
[1:29:03] this vineyard dressing this garden
[1:29:04] this garden represents a wife and then
[1:29:07] it says in Genesis that there the Lord
[1:29:09] took the man and put him into the garden
[1:29:13] what are we having this endtime we have
[1:29:16] her Christ The Tree of Life comes down
[1:29:18] into the midst of her United one with
[1:29:22] the Tree of Life brother Branham says
[1:29:26] and does God change his mind
[1:29:28] he says now Jesus came in three names
[1:29:31] now I'm really biting off a mouthful
[1:29:34] here and this is things I know you're
[1:29:37] faithfully taught so you can immediately
[1:29:38] begin to connect all the the dozens of
[1:29:40] places or so where brother Mehmet uses
[1:29:42] this teaching he came in three names son
[1:29:44] of man which is a prophet the son of God
[1:29:46] which went through the church age so he
[1:29:49] says the son of God is the Baptist
[1:29:50] although goes to the Holy Ghost through
[1:29:52] the church ages so he manifested him or
[1:29:55] revealed himself as the Son of God
[1:29:57] through church ages now I'm just gonna
[1:30:00] use this language for you to ponder so
[1:30:02] that if you reveals himself as son of
[1:30:04] men then that's a special dispensation
[1:30:09] that's that that's your exit out of
[1:30:11] Laodicea
[1:30:13] that's why we're in a bride age anybody
[1:30:16] says layout to see is over all right
[1:30:18] well it is for the bride but all you got
[1:30:19] to do is look out there and know it
[1:30:20] ain't over lael to see it exist around
[1:30:23] us but what are we calling people out of
[1:30:25] label to see it too - a bride age to a
[1:30:29] place of safety a secret place a secret
[1:30:31] feast so he teaches us very carefully he
[1:30:35] says then son of David which would be
[1:30:37] the Millennium and he says but in
[1:30:40] between the Son of God and son of David
[1:30:42] according to his own word and according
[1:30:45] to Malachi 4 in many scriptures he is to
[1:30:48] return back into his church in physical
[1:30:53] form in the people in human beings in
[1:30:57] the way of being a prophet oh he's the
[1:31:01] return back it's the son of man in his
[1:31:04] people again the son at the revelation
[1:31:07] the son of man is the invisible union of
[1:31:09] Christ to his bride that's what the
[1:31:11] revealed of the Son of Man is it's
[1:31:12] Christ United with this bride repeating
[1:31:15] the Ministry of the son of man not just
[1:31:18] one man it came by way of a prophet a
[1:31:21] son of man revealing the son of man but
[1:31:24] now the bride becomes the final voice of
[1:31:26] the final age because there's been an
[1:31:28] invisible union with her head the
[1:31:31] revelation of the capstone is a
[1:31:33] vindication the raptures at hand
[1:31:34] it's the uniting between the bride and
[1:31:36] Christ that's this is the promise of the
[1:31:40] revealing of the son of man not the
[1:31:42] denominational conception of a 900-foot
[1:31:44] Jesus that splits the sky and Janes will
[1:31:47] start digging out graves and airplanes
[1:31:48] are crashing and there's just a great
[1:31:50] catastrophe and a big mess but here is
[1:31:52] the secret of the revealed of the Son of
[1:31:53] Man he's returned back into his bride
[1:31:56] and now he's in physical form because
[1:32:00] that's one of the big stumbling blocks
[1:32:01] for this is the form he takes on he's in
[1:32:04] physical form he is in the physical form
[1:32:08] of his bride in human beings in his
[1:32:10] people because the corporal body of
[1:32:14] Jesus Christ the one that was shed for
[1:32:16] us the body that's given for us it won't
[1:32:18] take a step foot on this earth until he
[1:32:19] returns back with his bride in the
[1:32:22] Millennium so now he's returned back in
[1:32:25] you
[1:32:26] listen I believe this expression of his
[1:32:29] coming this this coming to the son of
[1:32:30] man is just as peculiar as the first one
[1:32:33] look at Jesus all the rumors surrounding
[1:32:35] him illegitimate child of his some young
[1:32:38] teenage girl and could it be a Roman
[1:32:40] soldier but that Joseph look how much
[1:32:42] older he is and heard all these things
[1:32:43] all these rumors swirling around but yet
[1:32:45] there's God in flesh and here it is
[1:32:47] again today God in the flesh of his
[1:32:50] people this was always what was in God's
[1:32:52] mind so here is he's returned back into
[1:32:56] his bride and to me it just gives great
[1:32:59] clarity to this prophecy of revelations
[1:33:01] 3:20 behold I stand at the door knock If
[1:33:04] any man hear my voice I will open the
[1:33:06] door and open the door I will come in to
[1:33:11] him here it is in the end of Satan's
[1:33:15] Eden what is it that God does at the end
[1:33:17] of Satan Neath Eden there he puts the
[1:33:19] word there Christ comes down puts him in
[1:33:22] the garden that he's been bringing up
[1:33:24] through seven church angels put some
[1:33:26] right in the midst of her again I will
[1:33:28] come in to him and will sup with him and
[1:33:30] he with me he comes into his garden
[1:33:33] again for feast should I preach it again
[1:33:38] when I preached last night the big good
[1:33:39] that big good foundation for the bride's
[1:33:41] secret feast that's what we're living
[1:33:46] and that's what we're enjoying because
[1:33:48] right there right there and I shared
[1:33:50] this is just burning in my heart I
[1:33:51] haven't I think I've only gone an hour
[1:33:52] at this point brother BAM said you could
[1:33:54] set hour after hour I'm in the after
[1:33:57] hour and the very beginning here's God's
[1:34:07] perfect Eden and I just had a few more
[1:34:09] statements to read before we close she
[1:34:12] in God's perfect Eden Satan immediately
[1:34:18] knew that God has a plan God God and he
[1:34:20] knows God's doing something and God got
[1:34:22] us for shut all these types and shadows
[1:34:24] that are laid out but he hides the
[1:34:26] mystery of Satan his head Satan known
[1:34:29] what he was doing he would have never
[1:34:29] done it because the same thing expressed
[1:34:32] in the in the last Adam had they known
[1:34:34] that it was God's purpose that he come
[1:34:36] as a lamb and be crucified Paul said
[1:34:38] they would have never crucified the Lord
[1:34:39] of glory
[1:34:40] and it's the same thing the same
[1:34:42] language brother branham uses about the
[1:34:43] seventh seal in about the third pulp the
[1:34:45] devil could ever get a hold of it he
[1:34:46] would do great damage that's a paradox
[1:34:48] because it's been made known unto us but
[1:34:51] he's saying if the devil could ever get
[1:34:52] a hold of it the Word of God the true
[1:34:54] fulfillment of it he could have done
[1:34:55] great damage in the same way that had
[1:34:57] the devil fully understood that he was a
[1:34:59] land to be sacrificed he wouldn't have
[1:35:01] done it so it's very very intriguing up
[1:35:04] the language of Scripture and brother
[1:35:05] Rams language it lines up in these
[1:35:07] things but here Satan now knows that
[1:35:09] there's something that the goddess have
[1:35:12] for chaton that God's doing and he wants
[1:35:14] to interrupt God's program and he wants
[1:35:17] to institute his own because we
[1:35:18] understand he wanted to exalt himself
[1:35:20] above the stars of God but Satan could
[1:35:22] not create and then this is where I
[1:35:26] would love to expand upon this more and
[1:35:29] I'm by no means asking to be invited
[1:35:30] back but God says that only God could
[1:35:36] dwell in human flesh he said he reserved
[1:35:38] that right to himself alone so Satan
[1:35:42] could not inhabit the woman same could
[1:35:44] not Rhian habit the man but he could
[1:35:47] inhabit the serpent and by inhabiting
[1:35:49] the serpent he took a hold of the
[1:35:51] serpent and by dwelling in the form and
[1:35:54] flesh of that serpent he preached a
[1:35:56] message to the woman that caused her to
[1:35:59] fall and receive seed and in doing so it
[1:36:02] brought death and then brought forth the
[1:36:04] son and a child which was perverted and
[1:36:07] now Satan couldn't well that and
[1:36:11] immediately he does but he could not
[1:36:14] dwell in perfect Adam or the perfect
[1:36:16] woman
[1:36:17] he could only in dwell hybrid flesh so
[1:36:20] he couldn't even get in the side inside
[1:36:21] of Abel he could only get inside this
[1:36:24] this hybrid flesh and so that's what
[1:36:26] Satan wanted he couldn't create a
[1:36:28] kingdom he couldn't create a people he
[1:36:31] could only pervert and that's how he got
[1:36:33] access to humanity and that's why you
[1:36:36] kids even see that the spirit it that
[1:36:39] same spirit that possesses the the
[1:36:41] serpent that same spirit can possess the
[1:36:43] swine there why because he could inhabit
[1:36:46] the serpent to begin with but it's
[1:36:48] through the high breeding the
[1:36:49] mongrelized of the blood that's what
[1:36:50] Gabe's saying access to hybrid human
[1:36:53] but the perfect man that's reserved for
[1:36:55] God alone hallelujah thank God for a new
[1:36:59] birth thank God for the sealing of the
[1:37:02] womb thank God for the raising up of a
[1:37:04] super race but the very weight and this
[1:37:09] is where God's plan is so perfect it
[1:37:11] takes some six thousand years to build a
[1:37:12] perfect Eden there's the man there's the
[1:37:14] woman and a perfect Eden everything
[1:37:16] bring it forth of its kind and Satan
[1:37:18] comes down right there and gods eaten
[1:37:20] inhabits the form of what would look
[1:37:22] like a man and upright beast and he
[1:37:25] preaches a sermon to the woman that
[1:37:26] causes her to receive his seed and bring
[1:37:28] forth death after six thousand years and
[1:37:32] what was what was God allowing to happen
[1:37:34] a preview after 6,000 years Satan's got
[1:37:38] his eden a perfect evening just exactly
[1:37:41] the way he wants it all his perverted
[1:37:43] seeds bringing forth of its kind and
[1:37:45] right there in the midst of Satan's Eden
[1:37:47] God comes down and inhabits the flesh of
[1:37:50] a prophet who preaches a word to a woman
[1:37:52] who received seed and brings forth life
[1:37:55] and will not die God oh how this would
[1:38:00] end hey man maybe just hold some of that
[1:38:04] for this afternoon so brother Branham
[1:38:07] says in Christ revealed in his own word
[1:38:09] seed down to the age we started off from
[1:38:11] the foundation from the first church age
[1:38:13] when the seed went in the ground the
[1:38:15] complete seed then it come up through
[1:38:17] the feet Luther come back out then
[1:38:19] through Wesley then into the
[1:38:20] Pentecostals the tongues in the lips so
[1:38:22] now it's in the eyes prophetic of
[1:38:24] Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's
[1:38:26] nothing else left for it to come but him
[1:38:31] himself to step into that because that's
[1:38:35] the last thing there is the next is the
[1:38:38] intelligence does the bride have the
[1:38:40] mind of Christ yes she does that means
[1:38:43] he has stepped down into this the
[1:38:45] intelligence has come what the I brought
[1:38:48] the intelligence he says it's God
[1:38:50] himself just skipping now it's God
[1:38:51] himself it's be coming to a place and
[1:38:54] he's governed the body all the way
[1:38:56] through through the churches it's been
[1:38:58] his government then the complete body of
[1:39:01] Christ is revealed in the form of a
[1:39:05] bride that was
[1:39:06] taken out of his side like Adams was at
[1:39:08] the beginning whoa
[1:39:12] praise the Lord that's what we're facing
[1:39:15] today the completion of that word why
[1:39:18] because we have the bridegroom revealing
[1:39:20] we have the bride coming on the scene
[1:39:22] brought back together again in a perfect
[1:39:24] union brings us back to that part of
[1:39:27] that original condition in the Garden of
[1:39:29] Eden man and woman no wonder he said
[1:39:32] it's come to an age of the astronaut so
[1:39:34] it's called an eagle age he says we find
[1:39:37] over in the Bible we find in Malachi
[1:39:39] four that were promised that in the last
[1:39:40] days he likes it likens his profits to
[1:39:43] Eagles he calls himself an eagle he is
[1:39:46] the great Jehovah eagle and he calls you
[1:39:48] Eagles says he is able to achieve to
[1:39:51] himself a bride he is going to in the
[1:39:54] last days be able to get a brine that
[1:39:56] with the ministry that so exactly like a
[1:39:59] man and his wife becomes one
[1:40:02] when Jehovah gets his people like him
[1:40:04] then he lives in his people they are one
[1:40:09] that's the time we're living in it's the
[1:40:12] invisible union but not just the
[1:40:15] invisible union the indivisible union
[1:40:17] cannot be broken up cannot be separated
[1:40:20] the invisible union the marriage of
[1:40:22] Christ his bride it is the continuation
[1:40:25] of the book of Acts but it's not only
[1:40:27] the continuation of the book of Acts
[1:40:29] it's the consummation of the book of
[1:40:31] Acts because we will complete we will
[1:40:35] fulfill everything in this New Testament
[1:40:38] that's what he says about this church
[1:40:41] the bride will fulfill everything that's
[1:40:43] in the New Testament as we read in the
[1:40:47] beginning about the purpose of God and
[1:40:48] put that before you I want to close with
[1:40:50] this we can invite the musicians to come
[1:40:53] is that okay to invite the musicians to
[1:40:55] come he says I join with Joe this is in
[1:40:57] my Redeemer liveth I joined with job of
[1:41:00] old I know my Redeemer liveth and at the
[1:41:04] last day he shall stand on the earth I
[1:41:08] could see him now
[1:41:11] the last day staying in the form of his
[1:41:13] bride the complete body of Jesus Christ
[1:41:15] is revealed in the form of a bride he
[1:41:18] says that the purpose that God has I
[1:41:20] must serve this purpose my whole life
[1:41:25] must be brought into his purpose and to
[1:41:28] his program he says each of us is that
[1:41:31] way could we say that in our hearts
[1:41:33] today as you stand with me say it in
[1:41:36] your heart I must serve this purpose
[1:41:39] because it must serve its purpose it
[1:41:42] must come to its perfection it must come
[1:41:44] to manifestation and here we are the
[1:41:46] bride in the last days fulfilling the
[1:41:49] original completing the original purpose
[1:41:52] of the woman and this bride will fulfill
[1:41:55] all that's in the New Testament oh I
[1:41:58] thank God that he saved us for this last
[1:42:00] day that he's raised us up in this last
[1:42:03] days for this what a great privilege
[1:42:06] let's bow our heads together the
[1:42:09] musicians have a song in their heart the

[1:42:17] great purpose but he sent you forth
[1:42:19] today for two / to pose to position to

[1:42:53] within them that's coming to this
[1:42:54] perfection that it might create a
[1:42:57] desperation and a hunger to be what
