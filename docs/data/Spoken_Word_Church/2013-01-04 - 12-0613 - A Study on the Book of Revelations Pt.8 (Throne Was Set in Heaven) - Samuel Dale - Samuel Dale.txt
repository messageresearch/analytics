God revealed the Prophet said the bride is also to be revealed well then we're seeing ourselves in the book but odd to be C is we're not trying to find ourselves in the other well call that's fine they had their day and we can associate with it but we're trying to find ourselves in the book that we were told to stay away from right so you can see what a Satan has tried to to hinder us and understanding the book of Revelation because in that we can see our very day an hour that we're living upon the earth and the things you know that we are here and we we thank God for that now but we we covered up now until we started into chapter 4 and I pray that you just keep reading it and over and over and jot down your little culture along the way and we'll finish up with chapter 4 we're going to chapter 5 right now this past Sunday we spent actually two services bringing a point to you are trying to get point to us then the ride will go up in Revelations for one all right and then not seen until the 19th chapter I tried you say yes but brother their wares revelations 10-7 don't you think that's the prophets message that's exactly right right it is the prophets miss you this product this message is going to Israel when we get out of here and it will leave the prophets match the Osprey those two witnesses will pick right up and they'll have a wonderful background because you know I wouldn't doubt what they're not here right now on the summers tried to make it this man in that man who's worried about it no we're not going to be here to look at I don't want to go I don't matter me who it is that's right but if it would be anything I can do the happy to get it understand it now how did you do that but I do that with anybody you know I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't have no problems with we're trying to help anybody to get a an understanding of God because that's that's the thing that's always been in my heart alright is to try to help others but now we saw that so I just put about three little quotes back into where that we wouldn't you know have any problems and connect it together and somebody getting this message and doesn't get the the one before or whatever then it's hard to for them to be able to understand what we're talking about that's right see if I just left it there with that revelation for one we go up don't come back to nineteen twenty-one I'll kind of doctor and they got you know well then we just show that where the prophet is telling those sunny my toe on the brother Anderson I said tonight we may be jumping from one to ten to eight to folder if that's the numbers of this none of the quotes but try not to but i wanna i got a couple of thoughts in my mind that i want us to see and then we'll keep moving on and do it so let's forge number one of the notes we were using this pass undie and and look at what the Prophet says this is papered from the fifth seal 1963 322 paragraph 87 but the reason that he reveals that as I understand that it is because of the mystery of the book of addiction and luck as far as the Antichrist being revealed that's right now watch and it's a sign of time the church is going up now the Antichrist being revealed right now the Antichrist is not made known as the man of sin sitting in the temple of God to fulfill the first seal of the Antichrist not until we go out of here in rapture and a strut around them that question you know well first Thessalonians their male sensitive let fulfill the functions that yet all right so now we are seeing being what Israel will get because the Antichrist is revealed to us right see now literally he'll stand up nice that's right yes but he has to go through the stages of Antichrist spirit form a false prophet which will get back to in the church ages when we do cover a little bit the chapter five and then he becomes incarnate false prophet and then he can become the beasts that's if stages are the four four beasts they come up right but look what the prophet is saying be here as we come to revelations for one then the book of the mr. ridiculous party to end across leader of evil is made known to you not sure right no matter it's made known right now that's what's happening here all right now and what and at the same time to church is normal and these things don't even happen in the church age at all that's right there away from the church in the church absolutely fractured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of Revelation and does not return until it comes back with skin in the nineteenth chapter but these seals here are revealing one has been what is in what will be like everything is revealed in the seals all right now the bride has been given the seal that was the prophets message was to start there in 63 then to bring us his message the other was a restoration back into what would be known as the faith of the Father room 47 everywhere you want to start with it you know forty-sevens when they started keeping the taste her whole hand ability to hold it tight until 62 and the lies he was dealing with bring in the face of the Father Capricia what they were bringing my honor then he brought his message he's the Nugget in the years rapture minutes 90 years of preparation we said when he begins to sign right alright so they brought the prophets message begin their through the opening of the seal and going through the last seizure so then the sealed is going to really no one has been what it is and what will be and you're not have the Bride of Christ we look back at the Garden of Eden run and we see what happened in the garden probably do you say like is he said cerfancy what what happened in the garden what started that he's it is revealed in the sealed so we see what was the beginning we see I'm saying we the bride we see what's taking place now we see that is getting very close for that hope to walk into a covenant with the Antichrist I mean the Jews and the Gentiles in the basis of the Antichrist movement of hope in vases is just coming closer and closer and closer I try until you know it could happen at any time and you know yourself now be sensible you wouldn't you don't just start something you're doing because even many many many years ago I showed you this is probably 30 35 years ago that the Catholic Church is not in the World Council church but you all right but they have representatives that you know what's happened we we start dealing with you know we hear something that if you're going to make a sign a deal with some country over her when I letting go there yesterday and sit down and write out all of the stuff give a sense about that with the Bible and understand for years they deal on those things they're trying to work out all of the problems and then when we begin to see it it's already almost into a fact you know well see that's the way Satan does that add the christ covenant is already close to being made with Israel as a nation another 144,000 will come out of that and they're not counted as the nation while we're here on earth you know they're counting 144,000 which would be units to the bride all right see we see what has been what he is and what will they ever we see all the way to the future home the previous message has been delivered to you and I and we can see all the way to Revelation 21 22 and see what's going to be even what the city of the uh you know that's right because that's his bride no he's not going to withhold anything from no now you may have kept a few secrets from your wife before you marry her but basically you told everyone all right I know right you basically through the years of courtship for time of courtship you basically told your wife what to expect right you know and getting ready for everything all right now so think about those signs then you will see what's taking place so the bride does did she goes up revelations for one she's not single 1921 that's right but that's what I said everybody said but what you made revelations Tim Sabbath I stood and I expressed that to you I've done that for 30-something years when I'm excuse me I'd say about 20 years on that really or more on that in emphasis in essence I'm trying to explain it that John when he got up the dark he was wondering how he was going to get what he was a saying back to the church but he wasn't told her to to write this book of revelations to the world right collector chapter one write this and send it to the church I even named the ones that was to be sent that's right where it would come down to me and correspond with the ages that would come down right leave and that was going to be set to not in the world the world can't understand the book around the world can't understand Genesis 1 MA amen that's right away come on they can't do it the cameras there another have a few were born again we can and we quote a lot I say we go one better and said but does that mean we understand now see you doing that BIM coming up to where we are see then the prophet said john was looking and he said how can i get this back to the church when he realized something that happened that he had been taken from the church ages and he was riding to the message to you know and about each age is he wrote chapter 2 and 3 and they said how can they get that backpack so the key was the word but he's standing on how can I get this back bear to them but in the days of the Sabbath angel the angel to come in the Lady of cmh not the beginning of it but the ending of the age the dimension jerwood come now he seems that that messenger will be a prophet heaven and he says glory glory glory man yep you look up when you get time just go home I look it up the other day mr. Jacob loop but just look up the word but it's got a lot of good means to you know because it's a it's the word expressing in other words showing at that time or this is right this is something going to happen right just look at it on mccoll now let's go to number two and then number three will will read these and then we'll get into a message you or him with number two this is from the Feast of the trumpets 1964 719 the mornin serve our graph 36 37 the first three chapters the book of revelation revealed all the happenings unto the church then from the third unto the 19th of Revelation chapter of Revelation there is no more scene of the jerky talking about the bride you felt like a church the church dark the church go through the tribulation right but not the bride all right i call it the church goes up at the fourth chapter revelation returned back to 19th chapter of Revelation the bride of the groom together come into the earth and then from the 19th chapter to the conclusion out of the 22nd chapter is all over millennia mean what will be in here this power you're in the fourth the night King God is dealing with this real that's right all right now so that's not us being put over that right all right let's get the next one because that was what we grow them Sundy you get the point under paragraph 23 of the breach 1963 317 II now now we're going to turn to the fifth shot now this is not the seven seals it is the briefs between the church ages and the seals 70 and there is also a sixth chapter of our there was a fourth chapter of Revelation and that it kind of reveals something that would take place after the church going up that the church goes up on the third chapter revelation and does not return until the nineteenth chapter revelation see therefore the church mrs. the tribulation the bride mrs. the tribulation now the right the church system and we'll go through the tribulation huh but not the bride she's not going through the tribulation why cuz she's already perfect my blood of Jesus Christ oh and we missed the tribulation now that's wonderful heaven does ice trying to express Sundy you know we think about we'll look at all these horrible things taking place until now they're getting diseases that the doctors and fight medical sites don't even know what it is right the things that are just you know I mean is this something what about that little girl the other day with that disease that it's just eat enough the body they're having to take off appetite e parts of her body to keep your own then that's up whoever thought something would be like this yeah for you my brother round said he'd come a time cancer would be like a toothache and yep hey man disease is now they call it something up the chalk or something easy person is literally almost herbs the child yes big there's no no cure for him all right good nothing for it okay just bear with me preach sunday like 40 not gettin it hell if you're not you wound up giving me problem that okay dammit Helen who worries about that that may be part of that tribulation but it needs a great trip last night the elite revelation is the wrath of God we're at pre tribulation we're if you're a horrible time around the world right but we're not in the big privilege you may not be here then cause you're proud of Doncaster you crap the rocks to fall on you and then we'll do no good and then what about your body's just beneath what about even to work that the animals will lead off your bodies might still alive that's right club event yeah and be pretty horrible yesterday a man I mean make you sick and as you see that in the paper just recently work that somebody attacked that homeless guy and just eat his face up come to Tom grace yes sir what about that that's vishal an animal you know I mean I wonder brother I'm city without the Holy Ghost ain't nothing but an animal that's right yeah but how do you see what I'm talking about yes the bride comes in the rapture there everything all right in the fourth chapter a bad burn that why she doesn't have to go through the tribulation the fullest version does because she does not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the new birth you see what I say it as the new burger you may have it as an anointing may be that kind of a win but not as the new birth alright so that I she misses it you know and we can see it but as I said it let me save again see you say but with brother Dale I can't understand how come you don't want real nice again I didn't move that license 10-7 I even showed you where brother Brown said that revelations 10-1 about money angel is the same as revelations uh 113 right one standing in the midst of seven gold against o'clock another son of man burned about the back true no do we believe what he says he didn't are you mad at me cuz i found what he's saying you know or are offended at me because you know that i say these tiny them will do you know well that's all right I'm not worried about it but main time to make know a great thing it away I'm trying to beat one thing used of God to try to break the scriptures and the prophets message down to were you and I can understand it right we don't have the Holy Ghost with Nate lenders name for the greatest thing in the world for any money is the bad kids man all right now that ought to be settled with one thing in our hearts and our life ok now the prophet of God then John being who he was he could look back to the seventh church age angel you know the ending up and he could see that there would have been ability to tape the rest of what he would be talking about even in heaven you remember I gave it to you there we run around said that this was something like Paul's experience Oh John hadn't experienced my Paul see Paul was taken up and he couldn't describe what he saw but John was taken up and told her write down what he saw but now we know he wrote it down in symbols be all right knowing then it would be a prophet to come in the Leister age to be able to expound upon the symbols so they would you see what they mean I brother ousted the heat pump the book of Hebrews all right did he use the old testament in the symbolic you know the thing even says that John uses those things in the writing of the book of revised you use a lot of the Old Testament forms to break it night like I've always tried to tell you the name and he looks up and he sees tarius joslyn in the street well he may have seen 85 or 285 he hung it with him buick slowly over hills and Pontiacs and cataracts and the Zeus is everybody now running together and just you know right I happening room if I some torches like mine you know what good comeback right I saw a Buick and I saw an old mobile he's mean even seen the word he couldn't wrote it now cuz wouldn't even the word available for it man join wrote one what he saw if I cherish Jocelyn in the street but then it would come down to where we were the Prophet would expel the second on the gusset are here this place and those symbols are therapy but we've had that the one to break this in here man i'm handing all honor and glory to the Lord Jesus Christ but he did send the messenger right he did send a messenger right okay so now we covered what we were doing this for words chapter for now we'll go we'll reverse 1 and 2 i'm chuck before the revelation and then we'll just get into something and try to move on a little bit tonight so after this but after the church ages right oh I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and we covered that what that's the Lord is Lord Jesus i iron and heaven we didn't spend that much time on it but heaven is where God he is all right now now listen here's the one caution a lot of people wants to go into the Book of Revelations and they can bring you beautiful soundings and college all right I said beautiful family in the top it off let me enjoy but let's don't be so spiritual until we spiritual eyes every time that's right and do away with reality right you know there's people that believe that we're not going to go in the rapture in a glorified body we're going to be in some form of the otha new spiritual form you know and and the whole body is going to drop to the ground and be out in the ice is in some way we connect back to it over in the future home or somewhere I don't understand never could understand what I heard but see when you want to single out we will take the simple we got it we got it that doors Jesus Christ they ain't no door in heaven that doors down here I stood except you just put the wrong word in that they ain't no door in heaven just remember the only way you can get to heaven is by Jesus Christ who is the door and the only heaven there he is is where God is that so don't do away with watched our but let's no wait till we all get better understand what that is true see we can understand it here because it always the connection between the two one to watch what he's going on back in the first voice which I heard rumor as of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither I'll show thee things which must be here after in other words Astrid is all right we went through the voice the same voice that calls you tell you to turn around the new birth the same voice to call you up but that voice is up that's right you said no it's just calling them out of the world hey man that ought to be the new earth the new birth or to start us out of this world and then the statue of a perfect man is still growing hill on the earth right we're going up we're hearing the voice but one day we will go up good we're not going to be like what is it the jungle witnesses we're gonna be just the basic thought is you'll be around here on earth and you know you building cars and you Mazzy paulson and you stay extended cuz he's fussing at you for missing something and the next day the box are happy you're happy we're still building cars you said no I don't believe it like whoa why not I believe we're going to be going on right here no it's unnatural uber right of course they've got a good doctor if you know their doctor they believe this group of people down here is you one is going to be going through this but that gray called out 144,000 they believe is the ones down to time they're going to be at the heaven I just got lost writer than you because they told spiritual they don't make me stay down here we're so related they're going up there well I thought we believe that we was going up there with God and I thought that would be people live down here right Clinton they've got scripture were just lining up wrong right you said any what too late brother did go find you wouldn't ask you to that what he believes then you come back say well you don't you said buddy buddy little difficulty letting election book so you won't you just want you won't worry about it but now think about it so let's go to verse 2 now for tonight and immediately I was in the spirit now if you've noticed that's four times in the Book of Revelations i'm pretty sure where you talk about being in the spirit story last year it isn't and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne right right now we're going to be dealing with a two-part thing first the throne all right then the one sitting on the throne now what is that throne in heaven now remember you want watch it dominical I repeated what do you mean brother Dale withdrawn God is in my heart well amen if you know what you're talking about i'm a men in the statement that's right i'm not a men and what your thought is about it I'm not agreeing with your thought because a lot of people have the thoughts in there no heaven it's all right here and I harm will worse the future home going to bed I'm all right here at heart we're gonna play hearts and set on clouds there will be no clouds because that has to do with the other part certainly it would be no harsh so we gonna I guess I don't have it money Dean you know I you ever you ever played an imaginary guitar for the dick these brothers can display these guitars my brother Chris come along display all the signs the hand at Camilla but you know in my mind I can beat everyone and I never yes enough in my mind beautiful piece of machinery but I can't get out of the way down on the word supposed to be done all right now let's do it but we're going to be dealing with a two part now like we dealt with chapter verse one where he said there was an open door and i thought was crouched and a voice and there was a voice of Christ whose any problems with that now the cottage to one person yes listening the profit today if he would say you know talking about in the church a smooth how did people think from their doctrines he says they're not just God he said that's what we're trying to explain the dim Jews won't have a father son Holy Ghost doctor but is there because you can't take that to them because they don't believe in that girl right but then that you will tell you that that the Messiah will be a human person born right but he knows that's God that will be glad standing on earth Brad he knows that I don't make two three guards out it neither does it make a worthless because he can understand that there's regarded heaven to speak and not like people think we don't of what that was is gardens up in heaven and Jesus was a ventriloquist you don't even god you're speaking of heaven yo her dad and mom coming up but now listen that's wrong No that's wrong started on earth no no and then has to be a reality in heaven right you say well you don't think is reality now sure do to my heart great thing but you have to take it all to be in my heart of nowheres else would mess up everything just as much as if you put it all in heaven and had nothing in your heart what would you be right you prick it all put it up in the head and have nothing in your heart are you taking it all in your heart but nothing up in heaven what do you got you sure left out a whole lot you left out a great understanding or so then God strong is right here in our heart that's right amen but they'll come on the day of Pentecost David we wasn't born with it in us it had to come on the dead kitty cox doctor ahora the new birth now it was in Jesus Christ the very throne of God was a very heart of the Lord Jesus Christ and it being back then when he came on to death henikoff he would dwell in our sole the village eternal I've ever and then the pool starts to carrying us in an upward form but one day we'll leave this earth amen that's right no i told you i'll give you a kia once you want so when i'd say i'll give you a little kill much while I pay attention watch Nixon be saying all right so if you take a little kid once won't think about it then the Bride of Christ has got a lot to do with it that we're talking about half am the bride of Jesus Christ not to church world old man that's right they got her place but the bride of Jesus Christ and got a lot to do with a man huh so we're think about but now note there was a throne said in heaven now on the day of Pentecost that throne started on earth but now listen did the throne start on earth and then go to heaven or the throne started in heaven and come to earth now what do you think I think it was in heaven first because according to my understanding of the Bible Jesus Christ supposed to be a slant a lane slain before the foundation of the world and from my understanding of what I've been trying to bring to you that what we're reading is now in heaven so then he was brought from heaven to earth that's right the throne of god was brought from heaven to earth the throne of god was the Lord Jesus Christ you greet them the very heart soul being person at all of the Lord Jesus Christ did you understand all that far so being person that's why Jesus could say over there in you know after his resurrection he said all power given under heaven and earth I know we got it here somewhere real wrestling and arson then you got ain't got no power he's the DJ powerless talk unless you can see the both the side of an nothing since I their psyche dammit then you see where things that so the true understanding is one God man so now if I don't read anything i'll give you these notes later in the dinner because I want I told him I said I which led go I know I'll find out a little bit and I'm go anyway I feel you bear with me but you see the throne of god was in the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ when he said the kingdom is within their argument over here with an old r was it in him or what he was the king he was the key and he was the kingdom when he was here on earth God lived on the throne amen in the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ you that He gave His life to release the life of God let that laughs of God could come back into you and I look huh see then when he died he said I hands I commend my spirit when he died he went up right and the Corporal body of Jesus Christ is on the throne in the heaven event that's what we just seen have been one sitting on from now I've always saying I don't want Courtland forgive me but always say that it's not a lifeless body weight now my Bible says by giving you the other day jesus said I go to prepare a place for me if ever you say well that's right in here that's right they gotta be something dire that's identical to this year we don't go back right so don't make it all here don't make it all right make it to a god wants it he gave his wife that it could come back in you and I and bring the throne of god and the bat gives them of the Holy Ghost into our sole right to give us eternal life no but we only receive guarantees is that the Bible right here are nice to marry her amen you got the prophets maintenance we all miss Reeve an artist that's right we'll see something's pulling us yes sir you look behind its stature perfect man you're going to get it faith and you look up the top you'll see love that's pulling it right drawing you now Joe Billy the drone that we're seeing in heaven started on earth damn when it left the heaven there is what's wrong you say little more than literal why because Jesus Christ raised in a glorified body you agreed so then the throne would be more than literal right you won't argue with us about the pointer well we think you ain't literal well I believe it is and more than literal that's right we call this eternal in that night but don't you think one of these days brother there with that drawn to be done away with you show me one quote from rudder Brown are the Bible that you're right all the representations that was ever used in the Bible to represent Christ and will be in heaven try to get back yeah my love that's right makes you think you see me brother led across star well why don't you believe the villain an amazing thing to me and I thought it was so wonderful I mean you ever been to biltmore house did you go in the garden and look at all of the trees and the shrubbery anything they got apple trees growing right straight up the wall close to that you know planted closer then that guitar is goes right up the wall you've seen it and the limbs go up and out and go hook right against that wall they designed it that way I stood there let's do nothing oh we get to heaven they'll still be a lot of crops as you right now on the cross was a bad thing do you think the crops from the bad thing it was your ability to go to hell the only way you're gonna get the hell of it by the crops and you think it's a horrible thing the tree of life will be there according to the book of Revelation high 22 he's a 21 or 22 you know and the river of life will be there that why do you want to do away with any form of God when he raised with nail prints in hand do you think when you would get there in the future homies not know how them know maybe that's what you believe anyone only right I believe they're still be a bad way not to have to remind us the big part of his attributes see that's why when when I get started then I'm begin to just roll into the guardian and I can't help it so you know bear with me that that's where I begin to seek my type you know I see everything in him I'm just trying to express it to you and I might try the throne come on come to man a boy was made for it to be delivered to mankind to make it roll into our heart now who's strong is that now Jesus according to revelations but it 321 I've got it in here but that's our they don't have to pull it he said he that overcometh will sit with me and my throne as I've overcome and sit with a father in history right now if you'll notice not a brother I'm uses the word on a long time that's all right I looked at that too but if you'll notice it doesn't say home it says he impact right because you got to make the person enjoyed one right now d everything got to come together no mom is like setting the first known to another person or you know whatever you do alright then when Jesus was here he wasn't on his own pro his strong doesn't come into being until of millennion we got a plan here so we get good but you see what he was doing was making a way for the Father strong to come in to be right absolutely amen the Father strong is the magic using the right we go ahead the new birth Jesus was making a way for the Father's throne to come into being into reality releasing his life to work to come and living you and I'm ready father struggling to be and run around said it's been the father strong down through seven church ages right that son of God right that's true he said then he'll come back to Son of Man amen sidity of me son David that's really the promise to Jesus Christ because David's son Solomon took over the natural but Jesus Christ is to be our God in the Millennium era to fulfill the promise to David is really the promise now where r evenings we got here until I want you to think trying to dis not read so much deny just preach a little about think America now this will help for later on down the road you know that it takes seven church ages neat shades having the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth to bring the Father strong into it's foolish be okay that's why can't do all these people say that Luther Western him to having the right they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for their day after the day was justification or sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been the same in every event code is the new murder now so then it's going to take seven Church ages to bring this thrown into total being and then when we get Barry you don't find it in the revelation forward you find the lamb in Revelations five right with seven horns and seven eyes which are the church ages and the messenger yep all right write that down bang on it but we're talking about here when this ad is not complete completely we be going so we're still in the forming of the Father strong maybe that's not a good word I don't know I don't have the education forgive me folks you put into that work closely now in this age all this did we complete you agree alright the Father strong is going to become completely right you said well it was darn about shirt was it with aren't each one of them listen you birth see if you just took Lutheran West with him I'm used to feed him colleges well off the earth world would be right and you would not have because it is a lamb with seven horns and seven eyes it's not a lamp with six home one and then you try some way to put two eyes on the next we make yourself eyes or so right that's not what it is they selling horns or 7i you take out any Church ain't the lamb is not complete so the throne in the hearts of mankind of the baptism of the Holy Ghost when that is completed finish complete the throne be completely you can't go to me son of man until he finishes that all of the doings will son of God r it around said he left some work for us to do you need that quote he said when he went went away he didn't finish all things so you'll have some work for you and I to do what are we to do bring forth the Father strong then I get back and I look at the message in the titles and the doings and I think about it you know that run around join you than exactly how it would do the brother round preach the message one time and they change the title just a little how you look it up and change it but original title was raised in Jesus from history now they got if you're looking it up you'll have to pull you under another word or do that raising Jesus from history now most of you know what I'm fixing to say those you've heard it many times you know that even though the Holy Ghost was there the new birth but you know that man and his ideas he dethroned God in the church heading that's not a good word to use but my best understanding in other words they took guard off the throne and made a Trinity then they could shift around the person's it was up there you don't move around in the way of saying they'd be thrown you now come on folks just be sensible I guess you know all of this when you first before you ever come into message Oh no she things about it him but you realize our doctrines took God off the throne even in our heart to be in full control don't tell me you didn't do is we all do trying to figure out you first come into the message first thing you try to figure out the Godhead and off and then you come up with the idea of trying to figure out who do you pray it two to one person one time I heard preachers say now we know who to break it well I thought that's who was praying to all time we just had him off the throne would you see when this prophet began to preach God was being restored to the throne of the revelation of understand yet he was bringing back the Father strong to where the father could sit on his own drum amen hi is that enough to cover the throne then we'll read a lot okay but the one sitting on the throne that's what Johnse see first he saw throne and there's no telling how long he said bear to look earth did I looked at it he's just stealing from then he saw one sitting on the throne and if not then why would he emphasizes my thing who was that sitting on the throne it's Almighty God in the form of Jesus Christ amen not Jesus the flesh he said well it's sitting on the throne up there yeah that's not the heavy that's right did you see church what we've done we've taken gone off the throne we put another guards on that throne what do you like that or not that's that way the round says you can call in Jesus Jesus and worship the devil now do you need that quote did you call in Jesus Jesus would be worshipping the devil that's right my because it's not revealed to you who Jesus Christ is you're still going to think he's a second person of the Trinity or a third or some kind of reform that's where you got all these two Lords and river Jordans and all that from we got to have two or three people running around they just can't settle it name well y'all got everyone that's what I to say where I'm at don't worry you going let's do you get that right but you know what when I get there I'll love you just as well because that's thrown in my heart has nothing but love in it right you may not be to the capstone of love no but it sure does love people and want to happen your wack in anything while because I believe in scraps right okay but do you understand won't say it right if you don't understand one God then you're going to be trying to make too many people sitting on the throne my brother dick says now that's the reason you can't understand is you you don't get it down to where the one God's that's right you can't understand the Bible with a Trinity you want to work out you go run aground some water let's see like the first seal here stands around with the book into that and diagnose a white horse rider was shredded carrots when we have like Danny then they go dear lemme run always go look at God doing there nice new Cupid address shooting love in art and run around them believe that very good until God straightened him out we say give me a quote okay he said I used to believe that Jesus loved me and God hated me until I found out it was a safe sane person that's a direct quote you wanted me but listen church is God on the throne in your heart now let's get it right without the bad kids with the Holy Ghost you can't understand do you agree to remind integrating one we're going mad because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the father strong in your heart right right Matthew's my Holy Ghost his father's throwing in your heart the person sitting on the throne is the Lord Jesus Christ himself right in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost not making us to people but making me a child of God that I should have been in the beginning I Matt listen to both Steven Wilson are they talking about you know that work right around my believers must go to this come on forward Regency we're going around did it when you were born a worded spirit brings you back like it should have been in the beginning he said I just hope that I'm pretty sure is this a message there he says I just wanted to be born into the Spirit of God walking in the light of the hour at you and I are living God strong is coming back and I ever beginning to match from here what's there when we match what's there we go dark cousin towards us to go but it's got on the throne in your life right and you say now wait a minute brother Dale well let's wait a minute now when we were believing a Trinitarian doctrine right I said when we were bleeding a Trinitarian doctrine life that's all of us you know whether you like it or not solothurn wesleyan him in azusa street Pentecost was Trinitarian sure but you know they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the new birth but in their revelation God was dethroned because he was a Trinitarian concept so you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not have all the words you agree i magnified what about me sure so you're playing a bad kids when the Holy ocean I'm going argument nobody about before you ever come into message here's Trinitarian and believe in that God had three there's like a bunch of grapes and we have it all explained enough is that true but you see then this message starts doing away with them God's right and when we told to get rid of our God's with all these all of them burning the miles you realize it's United Trinitarian doctrine in our mind and those God's was on the throne of our mind then God's not the true God this message is the only message your ears it can bring God back to the trial attorney you said well it could be with the book of Acts yeah but it's either I'm glad you said that way the coast we didn't understand the book of Acts and the Apostles and their doctrine until right the Prophet came back so now okay went back we were starting to get him on the throne you said brother Dale is he on the thrall of your art I believe I have the back is long ago I'm moving out of that Disney with it but is God on the throne the prophet of God said it like this he said he Lord of your life you remember the message called doors and door that's right you need to go listen to them he said they was doors in her heart that we had the door closed to now I do not believe we had seen in there like seeing of natural filthy garbage but we didn't have him on the throne of our hearty we had too many husbands right right better prom too many husbands cuz we had a father son and holy ghost and all that man now we drop over to Fargo to the one that's were just as bad so don't throw stones nobody that's right but what about it is he god of your life but around said we want him in our lives and I quote if you like it he said just enough to save us from senior just enough to keep us from hell but sin is he Lord of our line that's that hey ma mattress is the all of there is or is it still a lot of things in between I love my wife I love my kids I love my grandkids and great-grandkids my wife will tell you in a hurry that I've got one love that I have keep getting on she never tried to because she's got the same love right all right and by that she would never get offended to what I'd say about it because she knows who i'm talking about my live but she would have no way to try to take away the one that i have overthrown in my heart I'm because he's trying to get on her throne then I the way it makes a husband and wife one go got son gone the same dolch might not understand each other correctly yeah okay that's human don't we still got two more brains but in the finality what is it he is the Lord of our life we might love our families but we can't love them like we do going that's right trick right man asked me one time you go to church fury city if you come to the comments you had to make a choice between your wife or your jewelry so which would you give up you have any choice that's it very simple I don't have to think on it let's not give up my children because my wife was the ability to get those children and i still have even the ability to make it right for some lower you know through her but I said first off she's part of many he said when I can't say that these funds the end here in the church today right he's honest he's holding his children meant more to him than his wife did but why would you want to be that way my children how the same DNA but they are not if the one that me and my wife then we're not even the one lined obvious cuz there's two of us nature's one hand I wish we could get that down in our mind think on it yeah well we don't want to talk about Godhead we won't get any deep things work I didn't I thought the capstone revelation was the last revelation you need that mountain church in his book the final revelation is the capstone revelation of the Godhead to realize that you and I are a part of God made manifest that sons and daughters alrighty understand then the throne come on the death in a cup he came on the DEP headquarters in 3,000 people run it came on a dental dam Pentecost 120 the upper room at 120 upper room had to teach at 3,000 how to climb up the pyramid that was lost down through the ages and they never dealt with the fear me and that dethrone God the prophet of God started back in returning those things and begin to preach he got into 62 they started talking about statue a perfect night bringing God back to the right place on his strong in our Archon life but just remember we start reading we're not gonna do away with that time we're not going on so spiritual until everything yeah no we're going to go out with him in the heaven and be up there for about three and a half years well he's appeared in that Israel the frenzy slips back we could explain that one he's up there with us having a wonderful time and he slips back and peers to the Jews hey you remember he's gone right right but see then we all come back as the drive in Revelations 19 so we're not in there between 419 right but we understand all that's going to go on between them is that enough damn it got enough to think on it you now preach the macy done let me read so we read fast okay so if i jump backwards or fourth forgive me okay brother let's go to quote number 10 yeah i ask you tonight we got some abs and season this one tonight I told my system or were you out cuz we're going from one that direction to the other one go ahead brother let's go to 10 8 which is questions an astronaut e55 68 e paragraph 82 in the Garden of Eden the devil took man's head now i'm reading to prove what I preach okay if I understand what I'm gonna do I'm gonna read to you to prove what I preach okay the devil took man's head God took his heart that's the throne of God we're God dwells in the human heart and now if it's intellectually oh sure young man or woman that's born of God will act like the kingdom there from emily is intellectually don't act like it live it won't work with her neck revelations chapter 4 paragraph 2 37 61-101 now what is a man he's a trying being body soul spirit and meeting those that watch God's approach what is is hard you remember my message got chosen man's heart or his coming for his control power the devil chose his head for his control tower see he makes him see things but look through his eyes that's how much say Satan makes a seat night we look through his eyes honey but in it God in his heart makes him believe things that he cannot see well if you just show it to me I'll leave it now you gotta believe it in the extent right look through his eyes but God in his heart makes him believe things that he cannot see ddc did eat see God is on his heart in the heart of man is the throne of God you get it and God made his throne in the heart of man now what what's the first part of the man the first part of the man is body the next part is his soul you know the interchangeable back in their room industry day which is the nature of the spirit and that makes him what he is he approaches that he approaches now now the third part of the man is his spirit and his spirit is the center of his heart and in the center of the heart is where god comes far come for the go to the next be you see he be seen how to do garter service 1965 1227 be paragraph 1 33 through 134 but what God lining us to sheep and we must have a leader and that leader is not man that leader is the Holy Ghost the Spirit of Christ among us a little while in the world shifting the Lord his physical being was raised up to the throne of God where the Spirit was on the throne now Christ is on the throne Jesus a little while in the world stiffed me no board yet she shall see me for I'll be with you to the end of the world even in you the throne of god of Christ is erected into the heart and he's sitting on God strong but in the moment millennium he sits on his own throne which he swore that he raised up this man his son David son to settle with you strong alright so now where's the throne of god in our heart the matter when this strong here in our heart matches what's in heaven we go to heaven but just remember it's gotta match much doctor it's not that matches much here all right it's not that matching what's here it's what here matching what's that ok so then only is that father strung now let's go back we'll pick up now number for room we read for just a little while this is the message of being honest afraid it is I preach 1963 05 he climbed so high till he went all the way into heaven the Bible said he is so high though he has to look down to see heavens I like that heavens cuz there is seven come on heaven is he strong and the earth is his foot still there when he climbed so high into into power and glory until it sets on the Father's throne and looks down and there's not even the sparrow can follow to the street without anyone so where Jesus setting them of the Father strong right earthly being he's sitting in your heart by the baptismal we go that's right heavenly being he's on the throne will read them in whatever I said even is corporal bodies laying on the truck huh let's go go to the nation sardis the church age now he the door come show set with me on my throne as I have overcome and sit down with others from other words no work explanation of how that a throne of God can be the father strong and how he overcame and went to its father strong already read explanation in other word now i'm going to explain it t what everybody say huh other words i took within my body the Holy Spirit is like a more Jesus mistake I overcame come all the things in the world through the jet patient's about a holy spirit took over and him him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily all powers in heaven and earth is giving them to my hands he said all the power then God is perilous if he's another person where the Bible said jesus said after his resurrection all power in heaven and earth to give them to me alright so what is he doing he's taking explain it I took within my body what does the Bible say Hebrews didn't find a body down has prepared me God came down to earth in a body the body we called Jesus now all right go to the next this is the first seal 38 Dean's 1963 program 152 to 155 we all know it's Christian that God's Word of David and he would raise up Christ to sell his throne and give him an everlasting Kingdom here on the earth he did and jesus said he that overcomes the Antichrist and all the things that would the world cup of the world she'll sit with me on my throne as I have overcome and out sit down on my father strong fear now someday he rises from the Father strong we're going to chapter 5 dr. 5 is when that will take place mmm now some day he rises from the Father's throne and something's got to happen me he's going to raise from the Father strong all right look what he's gonna do and goes to take his own from now he comes to college suckers how's he going to claim them he'd already got the book of the death in heaven now so what are we wrong number six I notice the scripture for revelation 3 clinically him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me and my drone even as I also overcame and sat down with my father India strong that time when he was crucified that was God in and he went right to the throne the Spirit came back into your on right person that's why the father's Thrones here but the Father strong sign I shouldn't be any problem with thinking of God Evan but see that's what everybody else to do you won't have balances go up diner that's later denominations forgive me for saying it like that they say one of these days we're going to heaven when these days we're going to head we're going to learn everything to be great we want a problem to that all right now the people of this message got soul rebel aid the back during the sixties that's what they started preaching about time we came in the message the Father strong this year so there's no heaven so there's no way we'll help and this is gone because it no you start now I don't believe that one never did then don't believe it man I believe there's a heaven to go to that and then I believe heaven is one day going to come to earth then we're not y'all with us and he's just making cars and people build a car drunk we're gonna have a good time have on so we're going to sit with him in his room now remember this is the only age now follow me listen if you think they're not waiting on us d Bruce 1041 it 1540 maybe without us got to meet many perfect lemon 40 now watch the point this is the only age that man can develop into neva and the throne of the Son of man can be here on earth in the change of the vahana you agree now what about all of those behind this thing see they're going to be taken into that drone part that they had no understanding because they didn't teach this time they had no understanding of the son of man I've always said to you John or Paul even the great apostle ever mention son of man that is withholding from it even after John the Revelator wrote it in his Gospels and went over the pad listen so unlocking the son of man he still never could write about it put it in a revelation this age we've got to become good place in the son of man the bride of Jesus Christ on this earth before we go dark because you can't go now listen this may not mean a thing to you but listen you can't go from Son of God to the Millennium no more then you could go from Jesus Christ crucified and went to heaven and us step in a millennium now that couldn't happen could it but we had to have a new birth we gotta have a way to get to the Millennium that it takes the Son of Man then we talked about Malini right that's right then go ahead in the next name is number six is that one or not much number I'm ready excuse me I'll read just a few more here iam not you fit 7105 r fa dat sick then he is working in it if the only thing that different in Jesus no one sees his corporal body sits at the right hand of God on the throne of God now we know it's not down here then right so they got to be a throne for him to set on right seeing you so much all right down here woman worse yet that's all I've got the problems with everybody I'm sarcastic where's he at no you know he's not here that way do you ready to throw them in heaven I want if corporal body says it to hand right hand of God on the throne of god and what's that's not Jesus is strong you talked about in heaven right that's his father strong all right his strong one he's the heir fall Eric to that one because his old one he has David strong but he's on his Father's throne lady and he would overcome except sit with me on my throne as I have overcome and said on my father's from now he's waiting there in a corporal body but God sent his spirit back to the church ever known that number nine wasn't something beginning 1963 06 / go eat 53 the only thing different tonight I love that he said well God does not here like he used to be where'd he go you took him off the throne again right right no one thing never deny that he's using your flesh and my flesh because his flesh sets it to rock him to the throne of god in in majesty and glory he that overcometh shall sit with me on my throne as I have overcome and set down on my father strong oh what a wonderful thing Jesus Christ the Son of God sitting in the heavens and all these mortal soul that's just under the altar now that's not this you view that's right look up and see that body sitting there that corporal body oh I feel really is that poor provide keep it top of the Corporal monster everyone would be in trouble let's go to that this is the working of the Holy Spirit 19 kitchen 6 8 16 he 32 and the night Christ is not even city on his own prom he's sitting on who strung his father's strong you know Akash upset with me on my throne as I have overcome and sitting on my father strong isn't that marvelous and we have that great and grand privilege of knowing someday we'll be able to sit with him on his drum and he takes the throne of David which he's heir to and will ride with him a thousand years on earth and then through he turned in forever next I told my wife call numbers cooking he we're down to the next or get on no go through the ACE woman no wonder Tim Tim like 7i talking about I don't play through the 90 TN box left to go ABC oh ok number 10 work into the Holy Spirit 5632 oh that's one we just read it right ok go to number 11 just roll on now we're going to go when I go to number 11 oh the third seal 1963 303 20 on paragraph 29 now all that understand thats a man he has been doing the work of the kinsman redeemer with our will come a time that when the redeeming work will be over and when the regaining work is over then he leaves the throne of God where he seated now that's why everybody thought retention was over when the seals broke because he left the throne when dr. book nope but remember we're seeing what was why he isn't want will be alright but that's not your strong where is he seated night but that's not a strong even though what comes to sit with me my throne and I overcome and have set down on my father strong this is not his strong that belongs to the Spirit God Christ the Lamb that doesn't belong to him he is the Incarnate God see which is the same God made incarnate number 12 the Adelphi Christ of all ages 60 for 6 16 / graphic 60,000 50th if you wanted to do then when he died rose ascended to sit back the holy spirit that was the song gone God is a spirit and through the church edges it's been son of god are you finding and then in the millennium is sunday sitting on the throne ruling he has ascended up he that overcomes the Civil kneeling on my throne as I've overcome and sit down my father's from he is sitting on the Father's throne now but in the Millennium he sits on his own prom because he is the son of David he is son of man son of God sunday is just perfect a church that ought to be another face a cup of 23 more quotes I hope you understand right if that ain't enough to show what I was preaching then you need to go back and listen to what is preaching because from the day of Pentecost the Father's throne the baptism of the holy ghost came into the hearts of the sites Jesus Christ had to make a way that's a corporal body lays on the throne waiting yep finishing up you're going to find that body in Revelation fire at home the room their entrance now would you see he come into our hearts to make way no more than he could come down and die even and then just take us to the Millennium but how would you birth and neither can he just come down here in this age and just finish it up and just take us all to the Millennium there's got to be a way so when that prophet came out there in the early ministry and begin to talk about the son of money he said that same son of man is here today he said had to prove it that that son of man stood back bear and the dead was raised to sit with he'll lead ones are cast out and he said he's doing it right back down he was revealing the secrets of the heart did your mother with it would he said I saw you under the tree no they look Nathaniel my senior some of you under the tree I'm am standing here turn his back to the crowd you show the sign of the Son of Man you know the sound of the Son of Man is a resurrection tonight I hope you understand that it's the resurrection Simon son of man is when it raised the dead right the Son of Man not brother branham the Son of Man ministry standing here in the end time raise the dead about you said know something Fred well then how about FF I me know Smith Wigglesworth that raised fifteen or twenty three twenty three years from the date was that to suddenly it was a son of man ministry garage the dancer but it was in the wrong place wrong time right it was gone working I hope you go home and bike on this tonight the Father's throne is in our hearts right there's a Father's throne indelicate sir okay you want on the throne in our hearts but the baptismal only goes there's one on that throne and help have it they're not to resect on that front they've won them but around said the lamb come forward from the Father's throne to take the book so it's got to be something will happen right about my head musician first state bank on these things you get appreciate some family wishing that about flowers yes sir event and over the mind can only comprehend what the body can endure mistake iphone these things the throne of God is in your heart they're at front but there is a heaven heaven has come to earth and we're resurrected sitting in how many places at crime scenes it's all wonderful but there is a heaven hey we're going up with him one day in a rapture but you
