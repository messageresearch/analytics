And um let's speak to the author before we go to the word. Ready? Fresh heavenly father, we thank you for this day and we ask you Lord to forgive us of our sins. Cleanse us, Lord, and have your way with us. Pour out that form and let her rain through us, Father, that we can manifest that which you have brought to us and laid on our table here at this end time, Father. And we ask, Father God, today that you just bless every ear that's here and every word that spoke come from you, Lord. And reveal it to us, Father. Open our eyes. Let us not be blinded by the things of the world or and Father, we ask now that you'd bless all of those that couldn't make it through the door today, Lord. Be with them and bless them, the ones at home and bless our family members still out in the world, Father, cuz we know your word. Your word said we'd be here with our offspring. And we believe that, Lord, this time of season, we ask you just to bless each one in a special way. bless our pastor, Lord, as he's preparing to bring the your meal to us today that you've placed upon his heart. And you just be with him, Lord, and come down and use that vessel and bless him, Father, as he speaks to us. And we ask now, Lord Jesus, that you bless the reading of the word and have your way with us. And we ask these things in your name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. as we go to the word. Went the wrong way. Sorry. The old Bible don't have the names in it anymore. So, here we go. [clears throat] John five, I mean James 5 1-12. Go to now you rich men. Weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Miseries, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Your gold and silver is cankered, and the rest of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasures together for the last days. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been lon. Ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter. Be patient, therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husband man waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it until he receiveth the early and the latter reign. Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the judge standeth before the door. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy. But of all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by earth, neither by any other oath, but let your yay be yay, and your nay be nay, lest ye fall into condemnation. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the opening of the word. You may be seated. this morning. I want to I want to try a song this morning. Um, I I like this song and uh it's been many years ago I got to sing this song with brother Richard Marlo at the at the nursing home and uh you get thinking about this time of year, get thinking about all the ones that have gone on and precious memories and things and God's touched your life. I heard this song and I love it and just wanted to hear wanted [music] to sing it this morning. It's called It Came Upon a Midnight Clear. That glorious song of old. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; It [singing] came upon the mid night clear [singing] that glory a song of old from angels [singing] bending [music] near the earth to [singing] touch their hearts of [singing and music] gold. Beson earth good [singing] will to [music] men from heaven's all gracious king. The world in [music] somn [singing] stillness lay to hear [music] the angels sing. Till [singing] through the glowing skies [singing and music] they come with peace flowings unfold. And still [singing] their heavenly music flows [music] for all [singing] the way. Hear me world [music] above it. Sad and lonely [music] place they bend on [singing] our way. [music] And every [singing] sounds the blessed [singing] angels sing. [music] And ye beneath [singing] [music] life's rushing low are low. You tore along [singing] the lighting way with painful [music] steps and [singing] slow. Look now for glad and gold and eyes come swiftly on [music] the way. Oh, rest beside the weery [singing] [music] road and hear the angels sing. [music] For low the days of facing [music] home, my prophets sing of [music] all. And with [music] the ever certainly years shall come the time for trouble. [singing] And [music] peace shout over all the earth it is [singing] anient [music] splenders fling. [music] And the whole world gives back the song [music] which now the angels [singing] sing. Yet with the woes of sin and strife, the world has suffered [singing] long. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And the angels strength have rolled 2,000 years of Rome. And man at home with man. Here's not the long [music and singing] sound which they bring. Oh, hush the noise [music] man of strife and hear me angels sing. [music] Amen. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a night when there was angels, that heavenly host came with a message to speak to them peace. Thank God we had a message. &gt;&gt; We've had an angel visitation in our day &gt;&gt; to bring a message of peace to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know that message is still going on today. &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is stop and listen. There's still an angel voice speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. To bring you great tidings of great joy. &gt;&gt; That you can receive a king also. &gt;&gt; Not just one that came 2,000 years ago laid in a manger. But he comes to reside in you, take up residence inside you. &gt;&gt; I'll lead you and guide you. &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you. I'll be with you, &gt;&gt; even in you, to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus wasn't born in December. &gt;&gt; But you know what? That message still applies today. &gt;&gt; Every single day, &gt;&gt; we worship the God of heaven. &gt;&gt; He took on the form of sinful flesh that didn't know any sin. that I could become what he is &gt;&gt; today. I'm the righteousness of God because of his gift. &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to proclaim that to the to the world &gt;&gt; to show the world he still lives today. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Like brother said, don't let ever this message ever get common to you. &gt;&gt; You know, many years ago, the Lord come by my way. It spoke to me. He brought me out of the miry clay. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; He delivered me from the things of my past. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm sorry. I just &gt;&gt; I think about that. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful gift. You know, we spend so much time talking about people buying gifts and everything. [snorts] The greatest gift on earth is free. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And you want the world to see that Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.

Um, I just wanted to piggyback on what brother Emanuel had read. He read 1 Chronicles 16. [music] You know, the glory and honor are in his presence and are in the King [music] James version in my Bible is italicized. So, it's put with emphasis. Strength and [music] gladness are in his place. And if we skip down to verse 9, you see, give unto [music] the Lord the glory that is due unto his name. Bring an offering and come before him. Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. So, we've come all [music] with an offering of praise, I would hope. And my goodness, [music] there's such a presence this morning and my hands are just shaking. All right, so this is a a very well-known [music] song. He brought me out of the miry clay. So I invite all of you to sing with me cuz we all know the song and [music] clap your hands and give him the praise. Okay. My heart was distressed with Jehovah's [music and singing] W. And in the pit where my sin dragged me [singing] down, I cried to the Lord from the [music] deep fiery clay who tenderly brought me out to golden day. He brought me out of the merry clay. [singing and music] He set my feet on the rock to say he puts [music] a song [singing] in my soul today. Hallelujah. [music] He placed me upon [singing] the stone rock by his side. My steps were established. Here I'm abide. No danger of falling. [singing] While here I remain but standing [music] until the crowd I [singing] gain. He brought me out of my mind. He sets my feet on the rock to sing. He puts a song [singing] in my soul [music] today. A song of praise. [singing] Hallelujah. [music] He gave me a song to a new song of praise by night. My heart's overflowing. I'm happy and free. I'll praise my [music] redeemer who has rescued me. I'll sing [singing] of his wonderful [music] to me. I'll sing [singing] of his. [music] [music] I like this verse. I'll sing of his wonderful mercy to me. I'll praise him till all men his goodness shall see. I'll sing [music] of salvation at home and abroad. Till many [singing] shall hear the truth and [music] trusting God. He brought me out of the mighty [music] way. He sets my feet on the rock till his day. He puts a song in my soul today. I pray.

We are helpless [singing] and we're so afraid. Jesus arose when [music] they called him. He said to them, "Where is your face? Cuz you prayed [singing] all night.

Um, once I had finally gotten a grasp of on English, you know, with the vowels and all that consonants, uh, this was the first song I had sang for the church and was able to really articulate myself. So, um, I'm hoping that it reaches and touches y'all as it did me. Um, growing up, wasn't a very big kid. Strong, fast, yes, but the eye test I failed for a lot of people. So, you know, a lot of people thought they could come in, shake me up, you know, get in my mind, rattle me up, but I shall not be moved. Amen. So, I'm not sure what key really to call. So, just go. Jesus is my savior. I shall not be moved. In his love and favor, I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that's planted by the water. I shall not be Oh, I shall not be moved.

Say God bless you. Good to be here. We appreciate everybody. All of us. God bless you, brother. Appreciate you. Good to be here. Amen. [snorts] Amen. By way of a few announcements, remember there'll be no service this coming Wednesday be Christmas Eve and we will have uh uh no service then. Um happy holidays to all of you. &gt;&gt; On and off. Um remember brother Chris Long will be here next Sunday. Um watch night service coming up. These are all the announcements next not this coming Wednesday and next Wednesday at 8:00. Is it not switched? Um I want to give you a report from Jamaica. U brother Keith Reed. I know y'all heard that Mon'nique had a chatter appendix taken out. That's what exactly what I said. She had her appendix taken out. &gt;&gt; So, she's doing good and the Lord was good that [clears throat] she didn't have that attack in the air or have that attack somewhere else. She was at home with mommy and daddy. So, we uh we thank the Lord for that. But we have sent um according to reports um now this is accumulative of four churches uh brother Thomas Ber um brother Dut Scott, brother Isaac Negron and this church have sent approximately $26,000 to Jamaica. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] And brother Keith sent me a report that they have bought the material for the two roofs to go to Northampton and to go on Ginger Hill. And that's about $14,000. So they've got that started. They've got the wood bought. Uh they still need to buy, I think, the uh the roofing material for for one more church. Excuse me. But that's $26,000 that the four churches have sent over there besides what brother Joe Green got and besides what other people have sent them. But we wanted to make sure to send it to brother Keith so that the believers could have a um um you know benefit from it. Okay. Now, we did send a bunch of clothes and all that that y'all sent and put downstairs. We give it to brother Aaron and he took it to where he works and it's a division of Toyota and Toyota put it on a big boat and shipped it over there. But now that won't go to all the believers. That'll go to the whole people in the islands because we believe in helping humanity. We believe in helping our family first. &gt;&gt; But we believe that there is people there that were suffering that needed these things. So we we sent that out to them. So we sure do appreciate all of you for all the stuff you brought together. the funds and the food and the different things for us to send over there. And they said, "Thank you so very much." So, I'll give you another report when they finish or when they get almost finished with those two churches. Now, I don't know about the um uh the brother that lost his home there at Ginger Hill. I'll have to call and ask about that, but we pretty much the funds that we sent is probably going to be able to take care of most of that. The $26,000 from just us are going to take care of that. So, it wasn't just from the church. It was the four churches. Uh, Brother Brad uh Powell from Brother Ber's church jumped on the bandwagon and they um took up money and took up money twice actually. And then Brother Dutch Scott wanted to put some money in. Brother Isaac Negro. So, they sent it to us and we sent it through um Wells Fargo because we're that's our account Wells Fargo. And we were able to send it instantly to brother Keith. Only cost like $25, right Jim? to send the money over there. So, we did that, got that sent over there and and we'll get a report from them and if they need any more, we'll talk about it later later. But, but as of right now, I think that's enough for them to get started with. And like I say again, appreciate all of you having a part in it. So, and we sure appreciate all the gifts and the and the stuff that the last couple weeks and thank you so very much. And we appreciate the gift of eternal life more than anything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've um I've been asked by two separate people about having Bible study again. So, I want to kind of put it before you this coming year. Uh maybe having it like once every two months. U we'll talk about it. Maybe we'll discuss it in January once all the holidays are over and brother Joe and him's going to be gone. brother Luis and them's going to be gone and our line's gone and different ones are going to be gone uh during the holidays and that's fine. Go visit your family and uh come back to your church family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz that's the one we're going to live eternity with. The other one we'll see. We'll claim them all. We don't throw any of them out. We going to claim them all. That's what I was telling brother Boyd. I said, "Brother Keith Reed told me one time, he said, "Brother Wade, that's at the white throne judgment." He said, "We will have more power." &gt;&gt; We will have more power than the prevailing power that was in this Bible that said they got to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Because you understand one thing, somebody that never knew God ever, never knew about Jesus Christ, if they did something good for you through you, you would impart the eternal life to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how powerful your eternal life is. And you know what? That eternal life is going to carry you all the way to the white throne. Not to be in judgment, &gt;&gt; but to be a judge. &gt;&gt; And you know what? If you judge righteous, &gt;&gt; somebody's been good to you, your family's been good to you, your mama, your daddy, anybody that's not a believer, claim them. &gt;&gt; Claim them. Even it's a white throne judge. Why not? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's for big things. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because that's where we're going to have the most prevailing power. We will have eternal life. We'll be eternal people. and we'll have the mind of God. &gt;&gt; So, we'll not do anything that he didn't think we did were going to do before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; But he wants to do what? He wants to do it through us. &gt;&gt; Okay? If not, then we can just go home and sit down and just close our eyes and let God talk to us in our brain. Well, guess what? Most of the time that ain't God that talks to me like that. &gt;&gt; Well, hello somebody. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, pray for me and and brother Gay because he's he's admitting the same thing. So, just pray for us that the devil won't be playing in our head anymore. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; But back then ne back then we'll have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; We won't have to worry about that guy. He's gone. He's in the He's in this He's in that sea, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Of of of We ain't going to never remember that guy no more. &gt;&gt; The former things will pass away. Behold, what? &gt;&gt; All things will be made new. &gt;&gt; God bless you. We're uh good to have you again. We're going to stay on the Son of Man. We're going to try to get through some of this uh through Matthew 24. And uh now listen, there's only one man on earth that ever understood really who the devil was and where he was. &gt;&gt; All right. And that's the son of man. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He sat there and he told them, they said, "Is it me? Is it me? Is it me? Is it me at the at the supper? Is it me? Is it me? And he said, "Whoever sops the bowl," well here goes Judas the bowl and nobody knew a thing. &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew &gt;&gt; cuz he was the son of man. &gt;&gt; So keep that in the back of your mind. The son of man is the only only form of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That can tell where the devil's at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody else is deceived. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Except the group that's going to take the body change and get out of here in a rapture. All right. &gt;&gt; So, I just believe we're part of that. I believe that we are in the right message. &gt;&gt; I don't mean this building, but we're in the right building. We're in the right tabernacle. We're in the right mode of transportation. We're in the right way. &gt;&gt; We got to get oursel out of the way, but we got to get in the way that that that God sent us a prophet to go down that path. And that's what I believe that these seals are for. They're not just to expose the Antichrist, but they're to reveal Jesus Christ and where he's at. &gt;&gt; He's in his people. Amen. So, let's bow our heads to heavenly father. Lord, thank you for this day. Thank you for all the songs and the worship, Lord. Now, we're going to worship you, Lord, in in speaking of the gospel. Father, I pray that you'd be with each one. Lord, bless the ears to hear, Lord, and the hearts to receive today, Lord, what you have for them. Father, forgive us of our sins and mistakes. Lord, bless the ones that are sick. They're not here. Brother Joe and them that are traveling. Brother Luis and them getting ready to travel. Sister Regina already where she's at, Lord. The ones that are traveling, if we miss anybody, Lord, just protect each one. Father, this time of Christmas time, Lord, is a time that that we need to uh reflect on you more and know that it's not you that was born in a manger on December 25th, that it was we know it was in April, but Lord, we know that we had a birth. That was the manger of our heart that you were birthed when we were lost in sin and didn't know anything. We were out in the world running around and Father, you come to us and said, "Be mine. I want you to be mine." And we accepted him in our heart. And we thank you for that, Lord. That we accepted you, Lord. Now, Lord, I pray that you accept us. Accept the gifts that we give you, Lord. the things that we have today, Lord, to give back to you, Father, which is listening and hearing the word of God. Lord, just bless each one, Father. Be with the bride around the world. Be with the ones in the foreign fields like Brother Keith and different ones as they navigate through all that time of of turmoil and things in this country, Lord. I pray that you'd be with each bride over there and all the humanity, Lord, that you'll be with them, Father. And may they see Jesus Christ in all these things. We ask you in your name, Jesus Christ. Amen. 1 Corinthians 2:9, but as it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared. Now watch, for them that love him. So that puts it in a different category. &gt;&gt; All right. I like I like Paul. He He brings you He brings you a dissertation and he says, "This is why." &gt;&gt; So we're going to get the things that God has prepared prepared for us if we love him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're prepared for everybody. But you and I have got to be the one to accept it. &gt;&gt; But God has revealed him unto who? Us &gt;&gt; by his spirit. For the spirit searches all things, yay, the deep things of God. And that's the um in one of the um versions of the Bible says, even the inmost depths of God's being. And that's what we're here for. We're here to learn more of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. and his being and his substance and what he is and and how that he's been hid from everything else and and without a revelation he's hid from us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you can be seated and I'll continue reading though. Let me read this for brother Brandham trying to do God a service in 1965. Now, we're we're getting ready to start on the seals. Uh like I said before, we've kind of piecing this thing together because of people being out and uh we're going to be out in um January um a couple of days. Brother Richard Wilson is he just about pretty much lassoed me to come preach for him. So I'm going to do that on January the 11th and then on the 4th I'll be gone to hunting in Ohio. But we'll be back and then we'll get started end of January, 1st of February straight through every service will be we'll talk about the seals. Okay, thereby with now without the opening of the seals we will not take a body change. Without the opening of the seals, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; will not get the fullness. Now, that don't mean you're not a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to don't don't think that that because I you don't understand fully everything that you're that you're not a Christian. No, the devil's telling you that, but we're not telling you that. &gt;&gt; But to live a full Christian life, he wants us to be what? A stature of a perfect man. He wants us to be Christians to where if you can't find me, you can find him. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; He's the one you need to talk to anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. As we were talking last Sunday or before, I said I, you know, I being a pastor, that's it's been different the past year or so. But I found out one thing. You're never going to make it by a human mortal man. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to take the leadership of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; through a group of men by the five-fold ministry that's going to bring you to perfection. You just every once in a while, um, Brother Gabe, you need a shepherd &gt;&gt; with a shepherd hook &gt;&gt; or or break your leg every once in a while to keep you in the fold. But it's God that's going to do the revealing. It's God that's going to do all the work. All right? And we appreciate all of you and we thank you so very much. Okay. I the devil just beat me up the other day because I said I didn't want to be your pastor. That's not exactly true. I didn't want to be I didn't say I want this job. Okay. I didn't I didn't hand out flyers and posters and you know I've been through that voting thing, you know, so I won't be and I won't be the mayor after a few weeks. So I didn't become I'm not a mayor anymore. So, um um that that was just something that I did to help the community and I believe I did help the community and the community got better for it and now I hand it over to somebody else cuz I got a bigger job to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um but you know there is going to be government in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The government shall be on his shoulder. &gt;&gt; There will be kings and priests. And brother Bram said, if you got kings, you got to have something to rule over. All right. So, not with a rod of iron. That's down here. &gt;&gt; But we do like he he he leads us with what? Nail scarred hands. He leads us by example number one and by what? Grace number two. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're going to read this in just a minute because when we get to the headstone, there's only one thing Brother Ram talks about the headstone and he talks about it being Jesus Christ, being the son of man. But he takes you back to the scripture in in Jeremiah, I believe it is, that says that the headstone will come crying grace, grace unto it. Okay? &gt;&gt; So that's the headstone. The headstone is Jesus Christ. The headstone today, when we're going to read this scripture in Matthew 24, that was the headstone. Now, what do you mean by headstone? Headstone is the head man. And it's the when you have an arch that comes up like this in a doorway, right here in the middle of that arch is a stone. If you've walked through some stone archways, there's one big one in the middle. That one is if you pull that one out, it all collapses. &gt;&gt; So that headstone has to be there. We ain't talking about headstones in a grave. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on, somebody. We put them on there symbolic that there is a head. There is a head of of the whole human race. But we have a headstone that's not out in the grave. &gt;&gt; He's what? In the pillar of our heart. He's in the arch of our heart. &gt;&gt; And if we don't have him as the headstone, then we're going to crumble and fall. That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, just remember that. That's why in a nutshell, that's why the son of man ministry had to come back in the end time &gt;&gt; cuz it's the headstone to the church. It's the head man, which was the son of man &gt;&gt; back in power again in his people. &gt;&gt; What? Doing the same things he did when he was on earth. &gt;&gt; Which is preach a perfect message. &gt;&gt; To an imperfect people. &gt;&gt; Who took my water? &gt;&gt; H I did. I said it right here before church started. Somebody drank my drink. Somebody drank my water. Aaron, did you drink my water? No, I said it right here. It was about half full. Well, who enjoy it? Bless you. [laughter] Be like a priest looking for holy water. Somebody done stole everything. I bet Luis's got it back there. He don't have the door open. But that's why No. Oh, [laughter] who got it? Don't point. Everybody's pointing at everybody else. Brother Manuel, you got my water, didn't you? &gt;&gt; You don't know if it's yours. &gt;&gt; No, brother Manuel got it. You drink it, you'll be blessed all day. [laughter] [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I brushed my teeth three days ago. So, we're good. We're just family here. &gt;&gt; Okay. Just family here. But the reason the son of man, if he's standing on earth telling us this, that's why I was thinking the other day, why did Jesus stand on earth and preach the seals? Why? &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to tell you something. Nobody understood what he was saying. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nobody. And then when brother Brandham gets here and he starts preaching on the seals, what'd he say? You ain't getting it. It ain't for you. This is not for you right now. You know, go and live a simple life. Jesus tells them that when they're when we're washing feet, what does Jesus say? He said, "You don't know what I'm doing, but you will know hereafter." &gt;&gt; Cuz on the day of Pentecost, the hereafter came. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They understood that. Peter was like, "You ain't washing nothing of mine." Jesus said, "You, if I don't wash your feet, you ain't part of me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Peter was like, "Wash me all, Lord." Jesus said, "No, I ain't got to do all that. I'm going to wash you within on the day of Pentecost and then you're going to help others get washed. But I want you to wash your feet as a symbol &gt;&gt; of humility. &gt;&gt; We should be the humblest people on the face of the earth. If Jesus Christ, God Almighty in human flesh, the man that created the water, created the bowl, and created your feet, if you can't wash somebody else's feet, you're not going to heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, get don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; Because in other words, what the problem is now is I see is not receiving headship. &gt;&gt; Headstone, headship. &gt;&gt; That's what I told you many times. A lot of people want Jesus. They want Jesus to come into their life, but they want him to be Lord Jesus Christ. Do they want the Lord to take over? &gt;&gt; Because Jesus was just a man. Come on, somebody. He was just a man walking on the face of the earth and he was in a body that was dying. &gt;&gt; Now, are they looking at that man? Are they looking at the man that was inside of him? &gt;&gt; Because that man is inside of him in you and I now &gt;&gt; and then what that makes him that makes him the Lord of your life. &gt;&gt; So that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord. We we identify that he is the lord of our life. &gt;&gt; So let us make it a a new year's resolution that for him to be more of the lord of our life. &gt;&gt; Not to be someone that sits in the background. We want him in the forefront. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. So brothers he comes up and this is in 1965. So what is he telling the people? He said the mysteries will be revealed in the last day. And what do he always say? He said, "We are prophetic people with prophetic insight. We love revelation. We love the deep things of God." And and and don't get me wrong, I love everything's got to start with a foundation. Even when we get to Zerubable, he put a foundation. There was a foundation there for him to build on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we got to have the foundation, which is the sure cornerstone. Jesus was the cornerstone of the church. But remember, he's got to be the headstone of your life. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the cornerstone is right down here, but he wants to be up there. It's the same symbol. It's just up higher. &gt;&gt; And that's the headstone. &gt;&gt; So the headstone of the church is the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Right? So if we got to understand that to go further, then we got to understand who the son of man is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they asked that question, who is this son of man? But now remember, brother Brandham had a message to bring and it was in a two-fold manner. &gt;&gt; All right? He said in the church age book, we've read it. Dad's read it a million times. So have I this message of Malachi 4 is going to do two things. &gt;&gt; One, he's going to restore the gifts back. He's going to restore us back to the upper room experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter, James, and all those. Okay, that's the faith of the fathers. Now remember though, restoring back to the faith of fathers will not take you in a body change &gt;&gt; because it did. If it would have, it would have done them already. &gt;&gt; So remember that was lost. Remember even the Bible says the name of the Lord was lost during the ages. Why? They started baptizing the name of father, son, holy ghost. They totally lost the name. &gt;&gt; But they baptized in the name over here in the first church age, second church age, part of the third church age. Everybody with me? So now you got to have the alpha bride. The omega bride's got to be just like the alpha bride. Plus, &gt;&gt; this plus was, listen, don't get me wrong. This plus over here was another church age. &gt;&gt; Another move of God, another act of God. &gt;&gt; Now, over here where we at in the seventh church age, there is no eighth church age. &gt;&gt; There's no ninth church age. So, this is it. Right? &gt;&gt; So everything's got to be wrapped up in this message in this day in the time recognizing your day &gt;&gt; today &gt;&gt; and his message. So look, not when he starts out doing this what prayer lines. &gt;&gt; That was not his message. That was restoring the faith back for so people could have faith in this man called William Brham. &gt;&gt; But now remember that faith was superficial to some, &gt;&gt; right? That's right. &gt;&gt; Because once he started preaching the true message and he started preaching water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he started preaching no eternal hell. When he started preaching all these different things, what happened? Did those people come with him? No. &gt;&gt; They went gone. They gone. Bye-bye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the real message then is not going to be a public show. It's not going to be to to um I won't call his name, but the guy that's got 6 800,000 people. No, I'm not talking about in the message. I'm talking about out in the world. You know, 10,000 people in a man's church said he don't preach in sin. Well, maybe that's why he's got 10,000 people in his church. He's got 10,000 [snorts] sinners. &gt;&gt; I believe I will &gt;&gt; cuz I'm telling you, if you don't preach against sin, what is what are we doing here? Amen. &gt;&gt; And I ain't talking about And brother Brown said, "Now, now sin ain't smoking, drinking, gambling, and cussing." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's unbelief. &gt;&gt; It's not believing that what God said." That's why Brother Ram said, "We sin every day." Why do we sin every day? You say, "Well, I don't cuss, drink, smoke." No, you sin because you don't believe certain things. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Pray for me then. There's certain times that I don't believe certain things. &gt;&gt; You do too. &gt;&gt; But I know one thing's for sure. It's like brother Ram said, if you'll lay in the presence of the sun long enough, &gt;&gt; you will ripen. &gt;&gt; You will become what God said you would become. And if he said it before the foundation of the world, like I said many times before, don't ever say, "God don't love me. Right? &gt;&gt; He can't change his mind. &gt;&gt; If he ever loved you one speck of a second before the foundation of the world, he can never change his mind. &gt;&gt; Now, there's ups and downs and ins and outs and family and friends and all that that we got that we have problems with, but God is never going to change his mind. &gt;&gt; You will be a child of God if you were a child of God before the if he thought of you before the foundation of the world. That's the seed. The seed is what was in God's mind? &gt;&gt; Because remember, when it was in God's mind, it was eternal. &gt;&gt; When man started coming down here and adding natural seed, you understand what I'm talking about. Adam and Eve and different ones. That's when it got a problem. &gt;&gt; We got to go back to that. You must be born again &gt;&gt; and have the mind of Christ. Let him birth you in the manger as the song says the manger of your heart. &gt;&gt; So now brother Ram says look not when he starts doing this but when he begins to sound his message not the years of preparation in other words not the prayer lines. Now I want to get something really clear. There's groups in the message that believe that what brother Ram said from from 47 to 63. You don't have to believe all of it because he said things wrong. We just got to believe what he said from 63 to 65. Well, I'm like my dad always said, if you don't believe and and listen to 47 to 63, that's your foundation. &gt;&gt; You can forget about 63 to 65. &gt;&gt; Your foundation is, like I said before, it's getting those little things down. &gt;&gt; Okay? Right? &gt;&gt; The details. &gt;&gt; When you start building a house, what's the most important thing? Your foundation. &gt;&gt; You can build the prettiest Tajma Hall in the world and three or four years later you'll get cracks in your wall. &gt;&gt; You'll get your house leaning over. Why? Your foundation is not sure. We need, as the Bible says, a sure foundation, &gt;&gt; which is Jesus Christ. If we keep looking to him, &gt;&gt; then we'll be fine. then the building will stand &gt;&gt; on its own. &gt;&gt; But brother Brown said, "Not the years in preparation, but when he begins to sound the message, then these mysteries then will be revealed." And brother Ram said, "And here they are not knowing them, and you people are a witness of that." He told them right where it was at &gt;&gt; that the headstone message was being preached. Now, this is 1965. He'd already preached the seals, but he's get coming down to the end of his ministry. And he's telling the people, "This is what you're this is what I came for. &gt;&gt; This is it. This is my ministry right here. This is what the seventh angel messenger is come to bring. He to restore. And then &gt;&gt; then to reveal the seals, to reveal the thunders that are contained in the seals." &gt;&gt; And what are the thunders? It's a revelation. When the seal breaks, there's a thunder. &gt;&gt; I'll read you. Well, not worry now. Luke 17:30 says, "Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed." &gt;&gt; Not when he shows up, Brother Joe. Not when he shows up, when he's revealed. &gt;&gt; It took us from 1963 to 202 almost six &gt;&gt; to get the revelation. &gt;&gt; Come on. We're still here. So, we're still God's still revealing himself, trying to get us to see that he did come in 63 in the word, &gt;&gt; but just as they rejected him the first time, they've rejected him again. Remember, Judas hung around long enough to get holy and sanctified. &gt;&gt; But like I said before, 11 other people in that room did not think Judas was the one. Right? He's going to go yo yo. Well, he Well, Jesus told him go do what he's going to do. Well, he was telling him exactly who was going to betray him, but they're like, "Well, he's going to go and buy some more food or he's going to go pay for this food that we ate." They had no no clue. But the son of man is the only one that can tell what that other spirit is like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without it will you will be deceived. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So, here's the son of man. He's on earth. He's getting ready to preach a sermon. and they don't understand any of it. But they asked him a couple of questions. Jesus went out and departed from the temple. And his disciples came to them to show him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said unto them, "See you not all these things? Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down." Now when was that? That was in AD70 when Titus destroyed the temple. &gt;&gt; All right? And as he sat upon the mount of olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, tell us, when shall these things be? What shall be the sign of your coming and of the end of the world? All right. So Jesus answered and said, now we're going to go start as brother Ram did in the uh sixth seal &gt;&gt; and parallel the two because Jesus answered and said unto them, take heed that no man deceive you. Okay? For many shall come in my name. What? Jesus &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; or Christ and shall deceive many &gt;&gt; let's let brother Brandham explain that just for a second cuz what happened in the first seal you had a horse I was listening yesterday to um no it was coming back from Kentucky 10 virgins on the 10 virgins brother Brandham says that the white horse was the Holy Ghost riding through the church ages Right. &gt;&gt; But we know it was progressive revelation. We know that he we know that he's just a human being just like the rest of us. And listen, until God revealed, don't you know, we don't need to say, "Well, I knew that when I first Well, bless God. Pray for me." I didn't. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things I've had to learn over and over and over, Brother Kylie, over and over again. &gt;&gt; But you know what? Stay here long enough and you'll get it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay here long enough and you'll get it. No, I'm not I'm not talking about here. I'm talking about the message. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Don't ever think when you walk through that door you got it made. &gt;&gt; You might have a good seat sometimes or not. Have to sit somewhere else and have that look when you go by like they're sitting in my seat again. [snorts] So he Brother B. had a thought there, but I'm not going to say anything. Revelation 6 verse one. I'm just glad you're looking for a seat. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And I saw the lamb when he had opened one of the seals. This is brother Brandham. He goes back to Revelation 6. And I heard it was a noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, "Come and see." Now, what beast was that? That was the lion. L I O N. The lion spirit of the four combat beasts said, "John, come and look and see. Something's fixing to happen." &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, remember, John was only commissioned to write what he saw, not not reveal it. Write what he saw. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He because Jesus told him, Revelations 1, he said, "Write these things and send them to the churches." &gt;&gt; So that's what John's job was to do. So he saw these symbols. He said, "Behold a white horse." He saw a white horse. He that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer. Now, this is what tore a lot of people up because brother Brandham said, "Oh, this fell is the antichrist, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; Because a lot of people, a lot of commentaries said that was Jesus Christ. Even brother Random said mighty conqueror act in 1957, he shows him riding through the church ages um shooting a bow of of love and had a crown on it, you know. Right? &gt;&gt; That's why we needed a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's why we needed the son of man ministry to come in a cloud like he left in a cloud. &gt;&gt; The son of man left in a cloud. &gt;&gt; He came back as the son of God in your soul as the new birth. &gt;&gt; But he's promised just like I read you in the days of what? The coming of the son of man, these things will be revealed. Well, where'd he come? He came in 1963. He didn't come physically. He will not come physically until the millennium. But he is physically in me and you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's why that there's more of us got to be out of here &gt;&gt; that more of him can be in here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen, that's the whole walk of Christianity. &gt;&gt; It's not just coming and sitting in a church pew. &gt;&gt; Become what you see. &gt;&gt; Become what you believe. Believe it and live it. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; But who do we find this per great person was? He's the Antichrist. &gt;&gt; But remember, every clue we needed was in the Bible when John saw it, wrote it down, scrolled it up, &gt;&gt; put it in an earthn vessel, and they found it years later. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that was the apocalypse or the book of revelations. &gt;&gt; So John just wrote what he saw. He didn't make any commentary about it. He wrote what he saw. All right. And it was a wild horse. Well, you would think, listen, but we got to remember we are we are dealing with the most deceiving person ever &gt;&gt; to be on the earth or heaven or anywhere. Remember, he's originated in heaven. &gt;&gt; He originated in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about the devil. &gt;&gt; And he fooled a bunch of angels to come down here and try to fool a bunch of us. &gt;&gt; But what a fool he is. &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody is going to take this message and live it. And like brother Ram said, he said, "Satan will not know what to do with you." &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a lot of people he knows how to handle. I'm preach somebody. He There's people that he knows how to handle. He knows how to manipulate every one of us. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Brother Bram said, "Satan's got one lick at you." He knows your weak spot and he said, "You better cover it up. &gt;&gt; You better cover it up because that's the that's what Satan's going to start poking at." &gt;&gt; And listen, everybody sitting in this room knows what your weakness is. &gt;&gt; I don't know it. I don't want to know it. &gt;&gt; But you know what your weakness is because you live with you. &gt;&gt; So you take that and work on it. &gt;&gt; Work on it. work on keeping that thing covered. But he's the antichrist. But Jesus never said he was the antichrist. Jesus said what? Jesus said what? Take heed that no man deceive you. Well, this man did deceive the whole world except for those that are what? Marked with a mark or have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost, you're deceived. &gt;&gt; For many shall come in my name. No, what? in my name preaching saying, "I am Christ and shall deceive many." &gt;&gt; See, there's your seal. It's the Antichrist. Remember, he had a bow with no arrows, he went forth conquering and to conquer. So, in the first couple of church ages, that's what that white righteous church did. Listen, Satan knew he couldn't get a true Christian, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; with, you know, bar hopping. And come on, he's in here today. He's not out there. &gt;&gt; He's in here today and he brought his sleepy demons with most for some of y'all. That's kind of foolish to send a sleepy demon. I wish the demons would fall asleep. I'm not talking about none of y'all. That's okay. Let me back up again. I'll just drink some water. [laughter] Think about that for a minute. I want the sleepy demons to fall asleep. Not anyway. But he's here and he knows how to deceive you. &gt;&gt; But there's going to come a time. Remember, there was one man he could never deceive. &gt;&gt; Who was that? The son of man. &gt;&gt; He was never deceived. &gt;&gt; Ever. He knew everything that was going on. So if the Son of Man ministry is to do that, then the Son of Man ministry's got to do that here. &gt;&gt; Beware. Think about it. We come to a place and we look at this white righteous church. We look at this white horse and we look at this strong guy with a bow up. I mean, he's got that bow up like this and he's riding forth and he's conquering everything, you know, without even an arrow. &gt;&gt; But he's what? He's conquering by deception. &gt;&gt; He's deceiving the people into believing a lie. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, the Bible said the lie, &gt;&gt; which is the one Satan told Eve at the beginning. &gt;&gt; All right. So, it's Antichrist. And until you're born again, you are under that Antichrist anointing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sorry. &gt;&gt; Because all those all those without the Holy Ghost will be deceived. That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; All right. That's not an opinion of a preacher. That's the Bible. All right. So, first 2 Thessalonians. And now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. Now, be careful. The day of Christ is at hand. You got to go back to Matthew 24 and see that he said they would be false ones here. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So you got to be careful. You got to keep them separate. All right? Keep them separate. All right? So let no man deceive you by any means. &gt;&gt; For that day shall not come except there come a falling away first. And we see that happening right now. &gt;&gt; We see that falling away happening. and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God siteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God &gt;&gt; that's pretty close remember you not that when I was with you I told you these things and now you know what withholding that he might be revealed in his time. What? When he wrote this back, whatever it was, he knew he wasn't going to be revealed then. &gt;&gt; All right. And now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. All right. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work. Only he who now letth will let until he be taken out of the way. God letth will let until he the bride be taken out of the way. Brother Ram told us that. And then shall that wicked one be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the brightness spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming. Even him whose coming is after the workings of Satan with all power look power signs and wonders &gt;&gt; the devil &gt;&gt; and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and them that perish. Look, go back to what I said a minute ago. God will reveal himself to those who what? Love him. &gt;&gt; Listen to this right here. Because they receive not the love of the truth. Some people can receive the truth, &gt;&gt; but they can't live it. &gt;&gt; They just can't live it. They can receive the truth. Well, listen. We've seen people be in the message 30, 40 years, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They receive the truth, &gt;&gt; but they didn't receive the love of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because the love of it will constrain you to be right here and not somewhere else. &gt;&gt; And again, not I'm not saying this building. I'm talking about in this message, the truth of the hour and not out there saying that it's false and brother R was this and this and [snorts] it's nothing but the devil. &gt;&gt; It's that rider that's now on the pale horse. He's got all three powers working in him right now. Satan. But praise God, God's got all his power working in a bride. &gt;&gt; You know what? The devil might be looking for Jesus around here somewhere. &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, I'm going to I'm just going to give you a little revelation here. If Brother Brandham asked when he went across the curtain of time, he said, "Can I see him?" Right? He was in the sixth dimension. Everybody with me? He was in the sixth dimension. He said, "I Good. Okay. I want to see him. What the angel say? He's higher. You can't see him right now. Well, he was in the seventh dimension. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to tell you, there's two dimensions I know Satan can't get in. &gt;&gt; Six and seven. &gt;&gt; Six, we know he ain't there. &gt;&gt; Seven is God Almighty himself. &gt;&gt; So, I see. So, you're saying, what' you say, brother? Satan is not understanding that even in that seventh dimension, he's in your dimension. &gt;&gt; He's inside of you sealed. &gt;&gt; Remember, if you sealed, the devil don't know. And can't, brother said, if I say something, he said the devil can attack it. &gt;&gt; He said, but if I hold it in my heart, &gt;&gt; come on. If I hold it in my heart, even the devil can't get in there. He can't understand that that love affair between you and you AND GOD. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU go behind that tent and you go in THERE WITH GOD AND HE SPEAKS TO YOU AND GIVES YOU REVELATION, SATAN'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. &gt;&gt; He's gone off trying to deceive somebody else. Remember, Brother Bam said, we come we try to come to a place to where Satan wouldn't know what to do with us. &gt;&gt; Well, he didn't know what to do with Jesus. He took him up on the mountain. He took him up on the He took him in the temple. took him all and and all he said was scripture says no scripture says that's all you got to do he did like brother said he didn't perform one miracle he just quoted him the scripture and walked off &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and that's the same way with us and with all deceit of righteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God now watch for this cause God sends them strong delusion &gt;&gt; that they should believe a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe a lie. &gt;&gt; That they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. &gt;&gt; So that's a white horse. And then he gets off his white horse, he gets on a red horse and then Jesus is standing there and he said, "Oh, you shall hear of wars." There's never been a war fought that there's not blood been shed &gt;&gt; except the spiritual war. And and that took bloodshed, too. &gt;&gt; And you shall hear wars and rumors of wars. Red horse, what? Red blood, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; See that you be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass. Now listen, today I'm telling you, everything that you've went through must come to pass for your perfection. If you will believe that instead of the, "Oh, wo is me. Why is God pointing his finger at me? God might be pointing his finger at you, but what he's doing is he says, "Devil, go for him, but you're not going to get him." &gt;&gt; What'd he do with Job? He said, "Hey, come and look at Job. Job was sitting like we were talking about the other day, brother Gabe. Job was sitting in his lounge chair that one of them vibrating recliners that's got heat. How do I know that? I've got a recliner that's never mind. [laughter] We have a massage chair. But here's Job and I mean he's like, "My 401k's got a couple million dollars in it and I got so many cows I can't count. Uh my kids are all going to church. &gt;&gt; They're all alive. They're all with me. And I'm doing good." Right? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden, all of a sudden though, all of a sudden, it wasn't that. Come on. It wasn't that Job did something wrong, &gt;&gt; but what it was was is God wanted to show. He had an eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; He had an eternal purpose to let his son go through this. Come on, somebody. He let him go through that. Listen, IF YOU'VE HAD A BAD DAY, GO READ BOOK OF JOB, first two chapters. &gt;&gt; HE LOST EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; Even his little comfy chair, &gt;&gt; it burned to the ground. &gt;&gt; He was sitting on an ash heap of his of his house, &gt;&gt; scraping boils off of his body, &gt;&gt; and there was nobody left but his wife. And she was doubting him, too. &gt;&gt; Right. So Job was there all by himself. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? &gt;&gt; He did. Nope. He did. No, he did all the sacrifices. He did everything he was supposed to do. But God wanted to show Listen, show an eternal proof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll talk. Hey, listen. We'll talk to Job, but we'll talk about Job for an eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we'll meet the GUY &gt;&gt; AND HE'LL TELL US HIS EXPERIENCE &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and we'll like Job through your adversity there's no telling how many people come on somebody I'm talking about us too there's no telling how many people were affected by that man going through one of the MOST HORRIBLE THING HE LOST SEVEN OF HIS KIDS &gt;&gt; they died &gt;&gt; he had seven actually had 14 funerals if they were married &gt;&gt; amen cattle were gone 401k was gone. &gt;&gt; Any way to make an income's gone because his cows and chickens and all that's gone. &gt;&gt; So he's he's he's sitting in a in a depressed state. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I know my redeemer liveth." &gt;&gt; I know something's going to come out of this good. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, how many of us when we're going through it, can we say the same thing? &gt;&gt; No. We usually say what I do. Well, maybe God wants to just use you as an example &gt;&gt; to show someone someone else because remember the four the four um letters of testimony is tight. &gt;&gt; You got to go through a test &gt;&gt; to get a testimony. Right? &gt;&gt; But listen, the Bible tells us the suffering of this world &gt;&gt; is not to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us at his coming. &gt;&gt; We may look like horrible, destitute, don't know what we're doing, but you know what, brother and sister, that's God what he wants. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants the cream of the crop, &gt;&gt; but the cream of the crop might not always look good &gt;&gt; physically or emotionally. We may be a wreck, but God is going to do with his bride what he said he was going to do. He's going to perfect her here. We're going to be without Come on, somebody. We're going to be without SPOT OR WRINKLE HERE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT TILL WE get there. &gt;&gt; WE'RE HEADING TOWARD IT RIGHT NOW. WHEN YOU HAVE A BODY CHANGE, IT'LL BE IN THIS DIMENSION. &gt;&gt; IT WILL NOT BE IN A PROTECTED PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THOSE in the sixth dimension, it's just a protected, beautiful place. &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER, THEY'RE WANTING TO COME HERE. &gt;&gt; WHY? I don't know. But I do know. You know why? Because they want to be humans again. [snorts] &gt;&gt; It is in our DNA &gt;&gt; to be a human. &gt;&gt; And we can't deny it. &gt;&gt; In one more time. One more time. You ready? In Jesus Christ's DNA, God's DNA, he wanted to be a human. &gt;&gt; He always wanted to be a human. You say, "Why?" Number one, God can't change his mind. &gt;&gt; So, if he wanted to be a human, he's going to be one. &gt;&gt; If he's going to create the world, he was going to do it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We ought to put our We ought to put everything we got in that. &gt;&gt; THAT WHAT GOD does and says, he can't change his mind. SO WHAT DO WE do though? We go, &gt;&gt; I'm going to change my mind about that. No, you need to get over in his mind and it may change your mind. But when we get into these seals, listen, the seals is not this great uh you know, drawings and and horses and and you know, I'm going to I'm going to draw you a big picture over here, you know, and I'm going to have stuff blowing up and No, the seals were given to us to show expose the devil, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who he is, what he's doing, and why he's here. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you something. You know what the seals have done? The seals tell us where we're going, where we've been, where we going, why we're here, and all that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's for me and you because it's for your redemption. &gt;&gt; You can read all this and you can have all these charts and all these horses and all. It's for your redemption. &gt;&gt; It's for your perfection. &gt;&gt; It's for your day of grace. &gt;&gt; In other ain't getting to grace anyway. You got to give me some grace here today for a little bit. Y'all sang for an hour. I'm going to preach for three. So it's triple. You get triple time. So &gt;&gt; no, that's okay. But a red horse is what? It comes up to the next rider. Now remember that white righteous horse is still riding. &gt;&gt; It's riding today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and and as I said before, God is the one that is a exclusionist or a segregator. I'm not. I have people in the denominations that I love, but I know if that system eats them up, they're not going to heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother Brandham. And when he gets to these seals, he said, "I know now why I hated that system so bad." &gt;&gt; Why? Because it comes straight from the devil. &gt;&gt; Every denomination &gt;&gt; comes from the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never did come from God. And there's 13,000 of them now according to the internet and the internet's always right. So [snorts] &gt;&gt; what are y'all laughing for? Google it. It's like the other day, you know, I was u talking about Jesus, you know, being born in a manger and we always thought it was a wood manger with hay. It wasn't. It's a piece of granite that was heuned out. Well, the guys in Ohio because what happened was in the city of Bethlehem is where they raised the the perfect lambs &gt;&gt; because remember the lamb can't have a blemish. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; So they would bring those lambs in. How perfect is this? They bring those lambs in and they'd be birthed on this hollow piece. Jesus was born on a slab of granite and they laid his body on a slab of granite, but it's a h it's a hollowed out piece of granite and that's where the baby lambs are and they can wash them and keep them and and make sure that they're perfect. So, a manger is where you keep cows, but but that thing that he was put in was not a piece of wood. And if it's on it's online, just look it up. It's got to be true. It is true because I re researched it. It is where Bethlehem is where they had the greatest amount of perfect animals, perfect lambs for sacrifice cuz you got to have them. I mean, they're sacrificing all the time, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they would put him on that. And you can see if you look it up, it's it's just about this big and it's hollowed out. So, the group from Ohio, they were having a um Christmas theme, you know, party and a show or put on production. [laughter] Brother Elisha sent me a message. He said, "Now, we got to get rid of this wood thing now. What are we going to do? [laughter] Where are we going to find a slab of granite?" I said, "Don't worry about it, brother. Just it's okay." But, you know, the things that we hear, we sometimes we don't research. We just go, "Yeah, well, he was born in a manger. he was born in a a bail of hay or you know that's not what it was. And the and the the where he was born was it wasn't a a stable like we think stable. &gt;&gt; It was a cave &gt;&gt; built into the side of a mountain. &gt;&gt; He was buried in a cave inside of a mountain. &gt;&gt; He began that way. He ended that way. But praise God, he didn't stay that way. That's right. &gt;&gt; He came into mind in your heart. And now &gt;&gt; we have the devil's answer. &gt;&gt; And you shall hear wars and rumors of wars. I'm not even going to get. So anyway, see that you be not troubled. Now listen. Hold on. Let's go back. This is Jesus talking to his 12 disciples. Judas ain't gonna make it. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Judas ain't gonna make it. But the other 11 are just, you know, when are you coming back? &gt;&gt; All right. When are these things going to happen? What's the sign of the end? [snorts] &gt;&gt; He answered all three. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Then he comes back. Death, burial, resurrection. He comes back and gets ready to ascend. What do they ask him? When are you going to restore Israel? When are you going to DO THIS? WHEN? THEY UNDERSTAND WHERE HE SAID. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WASN'T FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BROWN SAYS IT AIN'T FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; It's for another group of people that's coming. &gt;&gt; For a special group of people. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He give it to us. COME ON PEOPLE. HE GAVE IT TO US. &gt;&gt; Good Lord. You s watch a stinking football game yesterday watching some of them playoffs and I'm sorry that's that's one of my weaknesses. But I looked at them. There was one guy, his name was Sterling Sharp. He played football for University of Miami years ago. He's an old man. He acted like a 12-y old. When Miami scored that touchdown, he was I'm going to get in my Aaron mode now. He was screaming. GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND WOW, like worshiping. And we go, "Praise the Lord. [snorts] &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Got the great Got the greatest message there ever was. [laughter] [sighs and panting] Got Jesus in my heart. [snorts] &gt;&gt; It would change if it was your favorite team. &gt;&gt; But that's what the world does. I mean, [snorts] &gt;&gt; they go overboard. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I just want to get in your heart and you live it. Cuz see, they're going they just live like the devil anyway, but they going to live like the devil tomorrow. And when the ball game's over, they going to go back to living. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But this is eternal. &gt;&gt; This is something you can draw from every day. Everything you need is right here. You just draw from that source. &gt;&gt; So, here's Jesus standing here talking to them. They're asking him the questions and he's telling them the whole answer. And then when they get to the very end over here when he ascends, they ask him about basically the same questions. &gt;&gt; When are you going to take over? When you going to do this, when you going to do that? &gt;&gt; He just shakes his head and goes on into glory. Cuz remember what he said, we won't read it, but where Jesus washes the feet and he says, "Now you'll not understand now, but you will hereafter." &gt;&gt; Because there was a lot of things they were going to understand. But now remember, I want you to remember one thing. This message that Jesus preached in Matthew 24 was so special. &gt;&gt; The disciples never preached it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's the opening of the seals. &gt;&gt; They didn't get it. &gt;&gt; And there stood the headstone right there in front of them telling them the who the six are, &gt;&gt; the six seals. And there stood number seven telling them &gt;&gt; WHERE I'M AT, WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, WHAT THE DEVIL'S GOING TO DO, WHAT I'M going to do. &gt;&gt; And they missed it completely. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN brother Ram stood there on the six on the questions and answers, he said, "IT'S NOT FOR YOU." &gt;&gt; You know why he said it's not for you? It's just the same thing with Jesus standing there telling them all that because brother Ram said, and I've got it on here. We'll read it maybe whatever Sunday we're done coming back here. But he said, Jesus said, he said, "These is what's this is what's going to happen." Brother Ram says, "Okay, this is all this is what's going to happen, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; And they're like, "We don't get it. We don't understand." &gt;&gt; But Brother Ram knew that because Brother Ram asked him, he said, I think it was on the fourth seal. He said, "Look, we're going to have we're going to have a prayer line, remember?" He said, "We're going to have questions and answers." He said, "Make it on the I got to read that." So, listen now. Listen to how this is William Brandom. All right. This is a guy that he's here for a purpose &gt;&gt; to call a group of people. All right. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Let me get let me get down here. Excuse me for a minute. I want to read it while you say it. Okay, right here this the scripture I wrote for John 13:7. Jesus answered and said unto them, "What I do, thou knowest not." Now, this is in the footwashing, "but thou shalt know hereafter." Then Peter said, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Don't ever tell Jesus never &gt;&gt; because he'll embarrass you. But on the fourth seal, now watch he said, 'Now in studying this, now don't forget now Sunday or Sunday morning, we omitted the healing service because of having the answers to the people's question. Now watch what he wanted. This is what he wanted. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to have a question on these seven seals. &gt;&gt; If it's bothering you, something that you don't understand, let's have it on the seven seals. Then I can tell my Saturday night whether it's enough to answer them or not. You see? And then just now, now watch. He tells them, "Do not ask about I had a dream." All right. And then just now say, "Well, about something else or or should I do this or or or my I had a dream." Them them's all worthy things. Now remember, they're worthy things, but let's stay right with the seven seals. &gt;&gt; That's what we're right on. That's what the meeting is designed to do. The seven seals. Let's stay right with that &gt;&gt; now. The day he had questions and answers, he got two questions on the seals and 26 questions on should women wear pajamas. &gt;&gt; Explain the new birth. Explain father, son, holy ghost is not the right baptism. And of course, he explains them all. But by that time, you know what he says? He read them questions before he came out and that's when he told him. He said, "You're not getting this." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's not for you either." I believe the Lord revealed it to him that it was not for them. &gt;&gt; If not, then that would have been it would have drove me crazy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowing that that week was the greatest week of ministry, he said, I've ever had in my life. &gt;&gt; And [snorts] nobody understood what he's talking about. Jesus standing here, I'm the Messiah. I'm here to save you and I'm here to give you this revelation and you're still wanting to know, am I going to destroy Rome? &gt;&gt; That's what they were asking him. &gt;&gt; Remember somebody said, one of the commentators said they wanted Jesus just grab a big sword out and just, you know, chunk all the Romans and throw them out and and then we're back to a millennium. &gt;&gt; No, they just missed the time of the millennium. &gt;&gt; It's later on down the road. But can you imagine a man right here? He says, [snorts] "Then also knowing right among you things are happening." I know you that you don't see it. See, I'm just positive that you don't see it. And you say, "Brother Brown, that's a hard thing for you to say that. I know it is." But look, let me just say this now. I suppose this is just tapes for oursel and so forth. Thank God it was for us. But let me say this that you don't get it. &gt;&gt; See, and you're not supposed to get it. &gt;&gt; So don't try to interpret anything. Of course, they didn't listen to that. They tried to interpret it, you know, polygamy and all that other junk as being the seals. &gt;&gt; Don't try to put your interpretation to it. You only get further away. Take my advice. If you believe in me now, if God has given me favor in your sight and you know that them revelations and things, I've been here with you a long time and it's going and it's always been right now to double prove it right hooks right in with the word. See, you know, it's thus sayeth the Lord, it's proved to you. But they didn't know what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; So Jesus is out there preaching his heart out. Nobody understood what he was saying. &gt;&gt; When are you going to restore Israel? When are you going to do this? When are you going to do that? You know, and and We look at what brother Brandon went through. We don't look what Jesus went through. I want us not to go through that here &gt;&gt; all over the whole bride of Jesus Christ. We got to get this or we don't make it to the body change. &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to get it &gt;&gt; because it's been spoke. &gt;&gt; Somebody will. &gt;&gt; But remember, Judas was among that group. and stayed there until the crucifixion &gt;&gt; right up to the time because remember he hung yourself and then Jesus got put on the cross right that's how close it is he was sitting right there eating the same food I'm talking about everything everything he ate was right there with them he was among them and he deceived every one of them but the son of man we're going to stop right here cuz it's it's Hot up here, too. It's just 70°. Boy, if I was jumping around for my favorite team, I'd probably be sweating all over the place. This is my favorite team. &gt;&gt; And I am sweating a little bit. [applause] &gt;&gt; So, we look, but we'll close right here. I We'll get started somewhere else. We're just on the red horse. But each one of these horses are a symbol of a power &gt;&gt; that Satan is using. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Red or white, red, black, and pale. Now, what is a pale horse? It's all three of these wrapped up together. &gt;&gt; If you'll do that sometime, take white paint, red paint, and black paint, put it in a bucket, and stir it up. It's the most putrid, ugly looking color you'll ever see in your life. But that's what the pale horse is in this day and age right here. &gt;&gt; It's all culminating into one. &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you something else. There's a church. There's a bride that has a real white horse. &gt;&gt; It's called justification. &gt;&gt; We have a real red horse which is sanctification. &gt;&gt; We have a real black horse. You say that's bad. No, it ain't because you got to die. &gt;&gt; You got to die. The Holy Ghost, you got to die. Or if you ain't dead, then who's alive? &gt;&gt; And then what? The fourth thing is all that wrapped up into one and we get out of here. &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, the rapture takes place on the fourth seal. &gt;&gt; And we'll explain all that. But re remember if brother Brandham can tell us, we ought to be able to preach it. &gt;&gt; I believe the seals are open. I believe that we can read the book just like brother Random did the Bible &gt;&gt; and then we can take the prophet's message and we can mesh them together. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what Jesus did. Now remember though, Jesus preached the seals in a symbol form and he was pointing towards something &gt;&gt; cuz I I don't have it in here, but remember after he got finished with the sixth seal, he stopped and he said, "Now let's look at the fig tree." Because remember, six seals finish his redemption. &gt;&gt; The seventh is his coming. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was standing there already on earth. He went through all these and the last thing he said, he said, "Oh, oh, there's a parable of a fig tree &gt;&gt; that we need to talk about." &gt;&gt; So, he diverted every bit of that back to Israel. Well, guess what we're doing when we get finished here? Not here, not here physically. when we get finished into Revelation, this all is going to Israel &gt;&gt; to two prophets. No Gentiles are going over there. Sorry about that. &gt;&gt; I was listening coming back from Kentucky the other day where brother Brandham uh he was preaching. He said, "Oh," he said, "That's my ministry." You know, he went to Egypt, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He thought he was going to take him out. If he would have done that, he'd have broke every scripture in the Bible &gt;&gt; and there would have been a a rapture of a bunch of Jews, &gt;&gt; right? And I don't mean that bad, but there'd be a rapture of them and not us. &gt;&gt; Cuz a prophet goes to them. They'll believe the prophet if he'd have went over there. Yeah. They'd have believed it. Cuz when Moses and Elijah goes over there and type or in spirit, they going to believe him. It's only going to take them three and a half years. It's took us 60 &gt;&gt; to figure this thing out. And we ain't got it all figured out yet. &gt;&gt; But in three and a half years, it's going to be like boom boom boom boom boom boom. &gt;&gt; But it's Listen, it's this message. It is not a Baptist message, a Pentecostal message. This message right here, &gt;&gt; this message through two prophets revealing Jesus Christ to a bunch of people that didn't care about him to begin with. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They still looking for him, folks. &gt;&gt; They're still looking for Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why they're going to say, "Oops, we're in trouble. &gt;&gt; He's already We're looking for him. He's already come. He's already been through seven church ages. He's already been through a prophet in the end time, our Elijah. &gt;&gt; And they're looking for their Elijah. &gt;&gt; And he'll [snorts] come. &gt;&gt; No doubt. Let's stand to our feet. He'll come. But it will come from this message right here. And it will come to them no sooner. It will be when we are ready and take a rapture. He will not deal with the Jews until &gt;&gt; you and I are out of here. &gt;&gt; Joseph sent his gentile bride to the palace before he revealed himself to his brothers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they were in that palace. She was in that palace with the two kids they had. &gt;&gt; And then he comes down and he reveals himself to little Benjamin, which is the type of the what? 144,000. Cuz Benjamin was his brother, &gt;&gt; real brother by blood. The rest of them were concubines and different things, but Joseph and uh and Benjamin were true brothers. So, but Lord, you could you could preach on that a long time, too. But God bless you. Appreciate you. Just listen to what? Don't listen to me. I said a long time ago, I wish to God that you could put a screen across or or a curtain across here and just listen to the voice of the person. &gt;&gt; Not look at the humanity and look at the how I do things and how I look and how I act. Just listen to the words. &gt;&gt; Just listen to the voice of God talking to you. &gt;&gt; Now, if you'll do that, then you'll shed all that other stuff &gt;&gt; and God will really be able to speak to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then you got to love me. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's inside of me, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You might not like my quirks every once in a while, but Brother Gabriel does. He likes me. &gt;&gt; Maybe his wife. Jury's out, but maybe Sister Rebecca. Lord, I've known them since they were all little little kids. She now they got now they got big kids. &gt;&gt; Thomas Shorty. &gt;&gt; It's good to see these kids come up. &gt;&gt; It's good to see them come up and and be around, sing, worship, &gt;&gt; be in service, &gt;&gt; and grow up &gt;&gt; like them were baby babies. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know what? until the Lord comes. We're just going to keep carrying on. &gt;&gt; Okay? We're gonna keep going on. We're going to keep trying our best. We're going to keep trying. We're going to keep trying to number one, expose the devil. &gt;&gt; Expose him for what he is. &gt;&gt; And then what? Then put Jesus Christ in the forefront. Because a lot of times we don't. A lot of times we put Come on. &gt;&gt; We get in the way a lot. Well, is it us or is it the devil? The devil knows if he can get you to re to believe him, &gt;&gt; he's got you. &gt;&gt; But somewhere in there, there's got to be something inside of you. Like brother Ram said, he said, "The devil told me the truth." Remember when the devil told him in his ear, he said, "Your baby's dying. Your wife's dying dead. Your baby's dying. What are you going to do?" He said, "I almost listened to what he said." &gt;&gt; He was a prophet. You would have thought there was angels hovered over brother Brana, but no, he was a human &gt;&gt; in a situation as Job. And then Satan couldn't understand when when when brother Ram just looked over to the side and he said, "Though God slay me, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; yet I'll trust him." &gt;&gt; The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we've got to be. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Every trial we go through, &gt;&gt; it's the Lord. IF YOU'RE A CHILD of his, why will he give you a stone if you ask for bread? Why will he give you a scorpion if you ask for other something else? He can't do that. He'll let you go through things, but remember, they're light afflictions. &gt;&gt; We're trying to escape a place that's going to be horrible. &gt;&gt; Horrible. You'll never know. And I hope you don't ever know. &gt;&gt; If you're a bride of Jesus Christ, you will never know. Amen. &gt;&gt; The torment that's going to be. And then one day, I like what Kurt Cameron said. Finally, he's he is just standing up. I mean, he they keep bashing him inside the head, but he's like, "No." [snorts] He said, "You ain't going to burn eternally." He said, "You're going to burn up one day, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; And that's what you'll do. Think about it. You exist as a human being right now. All of you, we're all human beings. We all have family, past, we all have &gt;&gt; memories. One day, if you're not born again, you just disappear, &gt;&gt; like you never was to begin with. &gt;&gt; To me, that's horrible. &gt;&gt; Because the bride, now we ain't going to remember the real bad things, but we're going to remember the things that we were down here. We're going to remember that we were human beings. We're going to remember we went through trials and tribulations because that's that's our testimony, right? Because the angels, they're just going to stand there and go, "I don't know what you're going through. I never was that way. And you say, and you say, "Oh, man. If it hadn't been for that guy right over there on that throne, &gt;&gt; if it hadn't been for him, I'd have never made it." &gt;&gt; Put your eyes on Jesus, &gt;&gt; not [snorts] on another man. &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song. God bless you. [music] &gt;&gt; From every sin, have the Holy Spirit constantly within. make the consecration. Trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost come in. Sing it to him.

Let the Holy Ghost come in. Make the consecration. Trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost come in. Amen. What a simple thing. You know, he's he's wanting to knock on the door. He knocks. All you got to do is open the door. I like that uh message brother Vine preached without money and without price. What a powerful message that this world and I'm not I'm not belittling anyone [music] that likes to make money cuz money in your pocket makes you feel better. Okay? But when we make it our God and we build up a kingdom here and we let our kingdom in heaven starve &gt;&gt; or go [music] bankrupt. But there's no price. There's no price to this. The only thing we got to do is just yield to him and live. He's already wrote the Listen, prescriptions written. And And brothers and sisters, he can't change this. &gt;&gt; So he's not going to in the middle of a in the middle of a trial, he's going to go, "No, I don't. No, don't trust this. I'm going to give you another." No, he's got this right here. &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; This is the thing we need. And then when we have this, brother Manuel, when we have this, it'll point us to the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And then we'll have more clarity and we'll have the between the lines that Jesus was telling. Cuz remember, he I'm going to start preaching again. He was preaching the seals to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was my WHOLE POINT. HE WASN'T PREACHING IT TO THEM. BROTHER BRANDHAM WASN'T PREACHING the seals to those people sitting in that auditorium. HE WAS PREACHING THEM TO US. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. cuz he didn't say now nobody's ever going to get it. No, he said you're not going to get it and you're not supposed to get it. But there's a group that'll get it. &gt;&gt; Jesus has got more patience than we do cuz he knew they weren't going to get it. He's going to have to die though so they could try to get it. &gt;&gt; And we have to die to oursel so that we can get it. That's all we got to do. die to oursel and we can get it. If we put self in the way, we always fail. &gt;&gt; Don't ever say I did something. No, you say Lord willing I'll do this or the Lord did this for me or the Lord even in a trial say the Lord this did this for me. Hey, listen. remember brother Louise and Sister Christine and the girls. Maybe they'll quit traveling one day and but but Sister Christine's going to see her family and we sure we sure love her family and appreciate them [music] and uh we appreciate them letting her gold come back. Same way with Joe and and Rachel. They're on their way to New Mexico to her family. So [music] if we can get all them people to move out here like somebody else's. Hello somebody. [clears throat] I need to stop before I start saying anything again. I guess I'll just I guess not. It's in my heart. I love family. Y'all know we we love [music] family and I love my church family. I love to be around believers. Why would you want to be around a bunch of drunks? And I don't feel comfortable. I don't feel if you feel comfortable in your world, you in pro, you [music] got a problem. &gt;&gt; I just don't feel comfortable because I'm like Abraham. I'm looking for a city whose builder and maker is God. And what brother say? He said Abraham didn't know it, but he was standing right on top of the city he was looking for. Well, we're looking for a city, but we got all the parts right here. &gt;&gt; Cuz you are that future home. &gt;&gt; Made without nails, &gt;&gt; made without hammers, &gt;&gt; made by blood, &gt;&gt; made by the blood of an innocent one. &gt;&gt; That died so that you can have eternal life. Oh, praise the Lord. Let's [music] sing something as we get ready to go. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a fellowship. You have a wonderful Christmas. &gt;&gt; Call somebody that you've never called before in years. Call them and say, "Hey, how you doing?" &gt;&gt; What a blessed. &gt;&gt; You'll sure be good if you'll do that from your heart. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You're dismissed. Oh, &gt;&gt; I'm leaning [music] safe and secure from all along. Leading, leaning, leing on the [singing] everlasting love. Oh, how sweet to [music] walk in this pilgrim way leading on the everlasting arm. Oh, how bright the path grows from day to [music and singing] day. Leading on the everlasting [music] arm. I'm leaning, leaning, safe and secure from all along. Leading, [music] bleeding, I'm bleeding on the everlasting arm. Now what have I to dread? What have I to fear leing on me everlasting God? I have blessed peace with my Lord's supping [music] on the everlasting arm. Leing [music] leaning, safe and secure from all along. Leaning. Yes, I'm leaning. I'm leaning on the everlasting [music] arms. Yes, I'm leaning. I'm leaning. Safe and [music] secure from all along. Leading. Yes, I'm leaning. [singing] I'm leaning on the everlasting arm.
