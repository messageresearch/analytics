[14:19] day every day
[14:20] thank you again I want to thank each and
[14:23] every one of you the one on the fishing
[14:24] trip with us that's not a fishing trip
[14:26] anymore we're going to just call it
[14:29] Father's Day fellowship it used to be
[14:33] that we fished a lot now I think we just
[14:35] fellowship and eat a lot so it's going
[14:38] to be now Father's Day trip do it well
[14:42] it's kind of like y'all it's the sisters
[14:43] the sisters day whatever y'all had up
[14:46] there was a laughing fit or whatever I
[14:47] heard it was so but thank brother sister
[14:52] Dale again for she went with y'all and
[14:54] daddy went with us so let's don't get
[14:57] that swapped up let's just keep it the
[14:59] way instantly but from way of
[15:02] announcements remember a new one here
[15:05] brother Terrence brought this to my
[15:07] attention at 9:30 in the morning
[15:09] I know we start our Sunday School
[15:11] classes at 9:45 but just kind of migrate
[15:14] to your Sunday School classes because
[15:16] some people are still sitting downstairs
[15:19] and when they do and we're in there
[15:22] yakking and talking from 9:30 to 9:45
[15:24] they can't watch when we turn the tape
[15:28] on for for the preliminary service so
[15:31] just about 9:30 everybody kind of
[15:33] migrated away from the that middle room
[15:36] so that some can still watch because the
[15:38] monitor zone for you to watch watch the
[15:41] services so just be mindful of that and
[15:43] I know would not need to don't need to
[15:46] start till 9:45 I didn't say start
[15:47] Sunday school at 9:30 on decision you
[15:49] need to migrate away from that middle
[15:50] room about 9:30 go outside or go into
[15:53] Sunday School class and start praying a
[15:55] little bit maybe if you'll pray then
[15:57] it'll be you know so anyway also now
[16:00] remember coming up July the 4th will be
[16:04] two Saturdays from now and we will have
[16:07] brother Andrew Glover brother from up
[16:11] north he's not from West Virginia now
[16:12] he's from Virginia so he will be with us
[16:15] on Saturday at 11 o'clock it will be a
[16:18] youth service we're already getting some
[16:23] requests for coming so we may have a
[16:28] crowd but there's a white board on the
[16:31] refrigerator downstairs and it says if
[16:35] you can keep someone in your room in
[16:37] your home please put your name down okay
[16:40] now we will not be able listen we will
[16:43] not know brother Dale may in his house
[16:46] but brother Andrew staying with me him
[16:48] and his wife but let's try to keep this
[16:53] for the older for the younger kids what
[16:56] I'm saying is that don't try to fill up
[16:58] with a bunch of older people when we can
[17:02] accommodate the kids coming and staying
[17:04] with us so just write your name down if
[17:07] you can keep someone in your home during
[17:11] that Saturday night a place to stay and
[17:15] then we need someone else June you need
[17:17] to put another one down there to sign up
[17:19] to help prepare the food because we are
[17:21] going to feed the people after we get
[17:23] with the service and then we'll just
[17:25] have a time of fellowship for the youth
[17:27] then we'll have regular service on
[17:29] Sunday at 10:00 and at 2:00 and brother
[17:32] Andrew Glover will be doing both
[17:34] services so keep that in your prayers so
[17:37] all right god bless you
[17:39] good to be here we're gonna start a new
[17:41] journey we were we were all into Abraham
[17:45] and all into Ruth and into Esther and
[17:48] now we're going to start with the
[17:50] children of Israel on the Feast of the
[17:53] Lord that's the name of it isn't it
[17:56] wasn't the Feast of Israel God never
[17:58] called it the Feast of Israel I read the
[18:01] scripture in just a few minutes he says
[18:02] those are my feast they're my feast
[18:04] they're not yours they're mine because
[18:07] he's going to bring in looks like
[18:09] brother Dale saying we didn't call on
[18:11] God and God called on us so he called
[18:13] these people to this feast showing
[18:16] representing that God calls us to a
[18:18] feast all right and then they kept the
[18:21] feast days in the Old Testament we don't
[18:23] keep those feast days because we know
[18:26] that when Jesus Christ came he gave us a
[18:30] rest but we still can walk through all
[18:33] of the seven feasts and we're not going
[18:35] to do them to get them today but I have
[18:38] more sheets if anybody wants any these
[18:40] are these are the cheat sheets they've
[18:42] got all my notes on them because I
[18:43] messed up and give all my stuff out and
[18:45] but I had to make notes so I had some
[18:47] notes on it so if anybody else needs a
[18:49] copy you can have one but we're gonna go
[18:51] through the feast days all seven today
[18:53] real quick just tell you what's going on
[18:55] and then we will take each day because
[18:59] man you can just keep going and going
[19:02] and going and and and digging into the
[19:04] Word of God because this eternal Word of
[19:07] God is eternal man so let's go to the
[19:09] Lord in prayer just before we get before
[19:11] we get started the Heavenly Father thank
[19:13] you for this day that you give us we
[19:16] pray that you would sanctify our lips
[19:17] Lord to speak and sanctify our ears to
[19:20] hear father because without you Lord as
[19:23] the active participant in the service
[19:25] it's just a meeting of people Lord and
[19:27] we'll go home and say oh boy that was
[19:28] good sounded good and felt good but what
[19:31] about tomorrow Monday when all the
[19:34] Devils in Hell try to come against us
[19:36] what are we gonna do then Lord you told
[19:38] us you gave us the shield of the word
[19:40] father and that word is coming forth
[19:42] today Lord to help each and every one of
[19:44] us to live a better life and to keep
[19:47] growing in grace and knowledge to the
[19:51] statue of a perfect man father forgive
[19:53] us of our sins bless this day take care
[19:55] of each and every one of us Lord keep us
[19:57] healthy and keep us alive and well
[20:00] father we pray that you'd be with the
[20:03] missionaries on the foreign fields give
[20:05] them fruit for their labor father and
[20:07] bless the ones that are watching in
[20:08] Lourdes some of the ones Lord that are
[20:11] at home sick we pray that you just bless
[20:13] them Lord the older ones we pray that
[20:15] you give them supernatural strength
[20:16] father you ask these blessings in the
[20:18] name of Jesus Christ amen so these are
[20:22] going to be the Feast of the Lord but
[20:23] before we read this I forgot to read our
[20:26] important scripture in 1st Corinthians
[20:27] 10 that says now all these things happen
[20:30] to them for examples and they are
[20:33] written for our admonition upon whom the
[20:35] ends of the world are come because today
[20:38] when we read this this is God talking to
[20:41] the children of Israel but you and I are
[20:44] not the natural children of Israel were
[20:46] the spiritual children of Israel all
[20:48] right we are sons and daughters of God
[20:50] we are Gentiles the Gentiles didn't come
[20:53] to this feast it was for the Jews only
[20:56] all right so if you're born again today
[20:59] then you will be able to see these
[21:01] feasts in your life you better be able
[21:06] to see them in your life okay so that's
[21:09] why I say it's the journey of a believer
[21:11] if you're a believer today you'll see
[21:13] that when we start and talk about
[21:15] Passover you know what happened you know
[21:18] what happened in the unleavened bread
[21:20] and the firstfruits and all the
[21:21] different ones that we're fixing to go
[21:23] through but watch what it says in
[21:24] Leviticus 23 because that's what we're
[21:26] going to stay on if you want to keep
[21:28] those and make notes on your paper
[21:30] that'll be wonderful and the Lord
[21:34] capital lor D that's Jehovah God all
[21:37] right that's the man talked to Moses
[21:39] says speaking to the children of Israel
[21:41] and say unto them concerning the Feast
[21:44] of the Lord not the Feast of Israel
[21:50] the Feast of the Lord because he's
[21:51] calling them to his feast today you were
[21:56] called to a feast all right speaking to
[22:01] the children of Israel saying to them
[22:02] concerning the feast of the Lord which
[22:04] ye shall proclaim to be holy
[22:06] convocations and we'll get into that
[22:09] word in a minute even these are my feast
[22:12] so he said it twice these are my feast
[22:15] but now watch we'll read the scripture
[22:19] again but I'm gonna read it when you sit
[22:20] down six days or you can stand up you
[22:22] can't it won't go to sleep standing up
[22:24] six days shall work be done but the
[22:27] seventh day is the Sabbath of rest on
[22:29] holy convocation you shall do no work
[22:31] there Ian it is the Sabbath of the
[22:34] capital L Ord in all your dwellings
[22:36] these are the Feast of the Lord now
[22:39] that's the third time he said these are
[22:41] the Feast of the Lord not the Feast of
[22:43] Israel these are the Feast of the Lord
[22:45] even holy convocations which ye shall
[22:47] proclaim in their seasons you may be
[22:51] seated in the Lord as blessing to the
[22:52] reading his word now these things were
[22:55] given for Israel to do they were
[23:00] something they were required to do
[23:03] because and we we know one thing's for
[23:07] sure that that in the Old Testament that
[23:10] God went with Moses he went with the
[23:14] different prophets in the Old Testament
[23:15] and don't be scared when you hear that
[23:18] that we believe God sent a prophet in
[23:20] the end time because God sent prophets
[23:22] all the way from Moses Abraham Moses all
[23:25] the way down and and it's just not so
[23:27] it's hard for people to to fathom maybe
[23:31] but it's all in the Bible God had to
[23:34] speak through these prophets to tell us
[23:37] and correct us and put us on the right
[23:39] path because man us we people got off
[23:46] the track amen
[23:48] I mean how can God be so confused and
[23:50] have like 10,000 different denominations
[23:53] how can that happen you tell me how that
[23:55] ten thousand different people look at
[23:57] the Bible and in 9999 of them believe in
[24:02] in three God
[24:04] our believing a Trinity there is no such
[24:06] thing as trended even in the Bible that
[24:08] word was developed by man Louise did an
[24:12] outstanding job Wednesday night bringing
[24:15] that out I don't want to serve three
[24:19] guards
[24:19] I want to serve one because it's really
[24:22] easy to serve one when you got two or
[24:25] three running around you got to go find
[24:27] them I'm just being funny but that's not
[24:30] the way it is what was the first
[24:31] commandment we're talking about Israel
[24:33] what was the first commandment everybody
[24:35] believes in the Ten Commandments what's
[24:39] the first commandment behold o Israel
[24:41] the Lord thy God is three Oh what do you
[24:45] think huh what wine Jesus stand up
[24:51] stunning no not standing on earth he
[24:52] said if you've seen me you've seen the
[24:56] father now he's lying if there was
[24:57] another person somewhere else if you've
[25:02] seen me and he looked at him and he said
[25:05] I and my father or two oh three one
[25:11] there's just different offices of that
[25:14] same God in this Jehovah God that we see
[25:16] he was in spirit form and he moved
[25:19] across to the people his brother Lewis
[25:22] was bringing out so wonderful Wednesday
[25:24] night the Spirit of God moved across the
[25:28] face of the earth one God and he only
[25:33] had one name and Jesus Christ is that
[25:36] name God's not a name Jehovah is not a
[25:39] name sorry Rose of Sharon's not a name
[25:44] lily of the valleys not a name there's
[25:46] only one name and the Bible tells us the
[25:49] whole heaven and earth name is Jesus
[25:54] Christ amen
[25:56] Jesus Christ is what we were talking
[25:59] about that God came down in human flesh
[26:01] that same God just spoke they they even
[26:04] knew remember the writers they even knew
[26:06] in the New Testament they they said thou
[26:08] art the Christ the creator and there
[26:10] stood Jesus in human flesh but he was
[26:13] fulfilling John 1 verse 14 that said in
[26:16] the beginning was the
[26:17] whereas with God the Word was God and
[26:19] the Word was made flesh so if he was the
[26:24] creator word in the beginning he came
[26:27] down and had to come into human flesh to
[26:29] save me in you this is the only reason a
[26:33] religion that our God is required to die
[26:37] you say God can't die no he can't die
[26:39] but in the forms that he took down here
[26:42] on earth he did that body of Jesus died
[26:45] but his soul was Almighty God or he was
[26:48] another person and then you've got two
[26:51] people talking to each other but anyway
[26:52] but Israel we only got one and that one
[26:57] God is talking to them and telling them
[27:01] that you've got these days that I have
[27:04] set up these feast days and if you want
[27:08] to go ahead and look on your sheet there
[27:10] we see that the Hebrew lexicon tells us
[27:13] that feast is melodic more what a that's
[27:20] how you pronounce it in that in the
[27:22] Hebrew but it's an appointed place an
[27:25] appointed time our meeting appointed
[27:30] time appointed time general a sacred
[27:32] season now that's what we're going to
[27:33] hone in on today as a sacred season and
[27:37] a set feast now listen let me tell you
[27:41] how accurate these feasts are they
[27:45] always started at an event they didn't
[27:50] just pop up one day and said let's have
[27:52] a thief
[27:54] no God said kill the lamb Passover
[27:59] unleavened bread one day after that it
[28:03] goes for so many days then you got what
[28:05] firstfruits do you know we're gonna get
[28:08] into this do you know that it's
[28:12] wonderful that Christ was the first
[28:15] fruit of the resurrection
[28:18] and do you know that no one in Israel
[28:22] think about this no one in Israel could
[28:25] eat one bite of that field
[28:30] I'll read it later no one eat a bite of
[28:34] that food until the high priest waived
[28:43] the first fruit over the people you're
[28:48] not going to get it without a fivefold
[28:51] ministry and we're not going to get it
[28:55] right unless God sent a prophet to make
[28:58] it right
[28:59] according to mouth count for he said
[29:01] I'll send you you not us
[29:06] you eat Elijah the Prophet before the
[29:09] Great and dreadful day of the Lord you
[29:10] said well that could be John the Baptist
[29:12] Noah couldn't Malachi 3 is John the
[29:14] Baptist he was one that told his people
[29:17] he said I'm the voice of one crying in
[29:19] the wilderness and that's exactly my own
[29:21] country not Malachi 4 and when we get
[29:24] into these feast days towards the end of
[29:26] it we're going to re-preach
[29:28] the five cups of Elijah because it's
[29:33] kind of strange that even Israel to this
[29:35] date have five cups for Elijah and we
[29:40] have five comings of Elijah which we
[29:42] believe was Elijah Elijah John the
[29:46] Baptist William Branham and there's one
[29:49] more to come and there he's the one
[29:52] that's going to Israel to draw out the
[29:55] 144,000 according to the Bible's that
[29:57] writes amen
[29:58] all right that was weeks amen you
[30:03] believe it you want to say it
[30:04] thank you so now let's look at the
[30:12] sacred season a set feast an appointed
[30:15] season an appointed meeting
[30:17] it's an appointed place the Hebrew
[30:20] letter can tells us that a convocation
[30:22] is a calling together a sacred assembly
[30:26] do you know if they even remember the
[30:29] man in the Bible that was picking up
[30:32] sticks on the Sabbath day and they
[30:37] stoned him you didn't do anything on the
[30:40] Sabbath but now let's get this clear now
[30:43] let's start
[30:44] reading go to your go to your page here
[30:46] now the first page where it says
[30:49] Leviticus 23 this one kind of sums
[30:51] everything up because what happens is is
[30:54] now a Sabbath is not part of the feast
[30:57] days now we're going to have to draw a
[31:00] calendar and we'll get into all that
[31:01] stuff but a Sabbath is not a feast day
[31:05] it's the holy convocation you do no
[31:08] servile work you do not work that is on
[31:11] Saturday everybody got that
[31:15] Sabbath is not Sunday we worship on
[31:20] Sunday I'm trying to be slow so
[31:23] everybody in here some people say I
[31:24] start too fast and I'm gonna slow down a
[31:27] little bit so the slower ones can hear
[31:34] understand and I just lost my train of
[31:38] thought what was I thought see if I go
[31:40] slow I can't do that but I thank you
[31:43] brother Bob I was getting back to him so
[31:44] the Sabbath day was the seventh day of
[31:47] the week they had Monday Tuesday
[31:48] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday did I
[31:54] miss one what's the first day of the
[31:57] week Sunday's the first day of the week
[32:01] money's not the first day of the week
[32:03] Sunday the first day look at the
[32:04] calendar you got a phone look at it
[32:07] sunday is the first day of the week
[32:10] Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[32:12] Friday and Saturday was the seventh day
[32:15] so the Sabbath to Israel was on that
[32:18] seventh day we worship on the eighth day
[32:22] are the three the first day because of
[32:25] what resurrection listen we as
[32:33] Christians should not have one day
[32:34] called Easter we commemorate the
[32:38] resurrection every week every Sunday we
[32:42] commemorate that Christ raised from the
[32:45] dead and that you and I are recipient of
[32:48] that resurrection
[32:52] slow down but listen let's watch this in
[32:58] Leviticus 23 verse 1 you pull it you
[33:00] look on your chart or look on your paper
[33:03] the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[33:04] speaking of the children of Israel and
[33:06] say to them concerning the Feast of the
[33:09] Lord which you shall proclaim to be holy
[33:10] convocations even these are my feast 6
[33:14] days shall work be done but on the
[33:17] seventh day is the Sabbath of rest now
[33:19] this is totally separate from the
[33:21] seventh feast days everybody got that
[33:23] say Amen this is God is setting up a
[33:27] rest day because what's gonna happen is
[33:30] it's kind of real strange that the
[33:38] Sabbath day the day after Jesus were
[33:41] crucified was I they call it a High Holy
[33:44] Day the Passover fellow on a Sabbath
[33:47] that's why they had to get him off the
[33:48] cross before 6 o'clock oh you say 6
[33:52] o'clock
[33:53] Israel's we've been let's do this before
[33:55] Israel's day begins 6 o'clock in the
[33:59] afternoon until the next day
[34:03] that's thick the hook in the afternoon
[34:05] everybody got that because you know
[34:08] where they get that from some of you
[34:11] know that when the curtain days of
[34:14] creation what did the Bible said the
[34:15] evening and the morning is the first day
[34:17] the evening in the morning is the first
[34:20] day so Israel their day begins their
[34:23] Sabbath begins on our 6 o'clock Friday
[34:27] and goes until 6 o'clock Saturday
[34:33] afternoon so on this seventh day is a
[34:37] holy convocation you shall not work it's
[34:40] the Sabbath of the Lord now Cena watch
[34:42] this that continually goes all the time
[34:46] basically back then God set up this one
[34:50] day that you do nothing reflect worship
[34:55] whatever you want to do but you do not
[34:56] do any servile work service work serve
[34:59] Allah means service no service work all
[35:01] right it's to be done that has nothing
[35:03] to
[35:04] these feast days but sometimes these
[35:05] feast days would fall on our after or
[35:08] before that Sabbath so that Sabbath is
[35:12] your that is your marker or that is your
[35:15] your point because what we're going to
[35:17] look is we're going to read on through
[35:19] here and see that certain things happen
[35:21] right after a Sabbath you mark the
[35:23] Sabbath and then something happened
[35:24] after that
[35:25] all right everybody got that well you
[35:28] know what we call it Mundi but what
[35:32] happens our Sabbath week into Monday and
[35:34] we all have to you know Satan just piles
[35:36] back in on top of us and here we go
[35:38] again you know to down the rat race but
[35:41] I hope we get enough on Sunday and
[35:45] Wednesday to get us through this thing
[35:49] all right these are the Feast of the
[35:51] Lord verse for six days show you work
[35:55] but the seventh day is the Sabbath of
[35:57] rest a holy convocation you shall do no
[36:00] work therein is the Sabbath of the Lord
[36:02] and all your dwellings these are the
[36:04] feasts of the Lord even holy
[36:06] convocations which you shall proclaim in
[36:08] their seasons now let's go to verse 5
[36:12] verse 5 we're gonna start with the
[36:15] Passover all right you should have that
[36:18] back there because all of us has got it
[36:20] here we don't we're on this one so y'all
[36:21] can watch that alright here we go okay
[36:24] on the fourteenth day now listen we got
[36:27] to establish a few things here real
[36:30] quick I just want you to think about
[36:31] this and then I'll me if I can find my
[36:33] chart that I did several years ago
[36:35] downstairs my little wheel chart when I
[36:38] was doing Daniels 70 weeks and we can
[36:41] find out what's going on but you just
[36:43] got to realize in your mind that their
[36:46] first day of their first month is not
[36:48] january 1st that's us
[36:51] okay israel's first day first month of
[36:56] the year is April or a bib or there's
[36:59] another word for it but we're gonna
[37:01] leave it at that for a minute in the
[37:03] 14th day of the first month and evening
[37:06] even evening is the Lord's Passover
[37:10] everybody got that same in on the 14th
[37:14] day now when we get into this I'm just
[37:17] gonna give you a
[37:18] a little bit of ten bit of information
[37:20] what happened on the first day of the
[37:23] month hmm no you put the lamb up you put
[37:33] the lamb up on the first day because God
[37:36] told Israel when we go back into Exodus
[37:39] when God told Israel said I'm coming
[37:42] through and I'm going to take your
[37:45] firstborn in other words the death
[37:47] angels coming you got to put up a lamb
[37:50] without blemish for 14 days so on the
[37:54] first day of April you're going to take
[37:57] your lamb and you're gonna put him up
[37:59] for 14 days
[38:01] make sure there's no blemish make sure
[38:03] there's no typing how Christ had no sin
[38:06] he took our sin he didn't have any sin
[38:08] he took our sin
[38:09] there was no broke bones you had to make
[38:11] sure the little lamb didn't have any
[38:13] broke bones and no bruises because that
[38:16] was the Lamb that they wanted at the
[38:18] time then on the 14th day you sacrificed
[38:24] it all right now on the 15th day of the
[38:28] same month now that was passed over for
[38:30] you those of you that's got my cheat
[38:33] sheet if you'll underline that that's
[38:35] number one Passover is number one all
[38:38] right so now on the fifteenth day of the
[38:41] same month we're in a bit now remember
[38:44] listen to me real quick April is the
[38:47] first day of the Jewish religious
[38:51] calendar everybody got that now if you
[38:55] go to if you go to an websites
[38:59] concerning Israel their civil calendar
[39:03] starts in October their civil calendar
[39:07] is different from their religious
[39:08] calendar listen we're going by the
[39:10] religious calendar because God said
[39:11] that's the day you do it because when we
[39:13] read the Passover God's gonna say this
[39:15] is exactly when you do this if I got
[39:18] that now I don't want this just to be a
[39:21] story put this in your life
[39:25] have you experienced to Passover what
[39:28] the dancing angel has passed over you if
[39:32] you hadn't then you're still dead miss
[39:37] Bexley I was the firstborn the best born
[39:40] sergeant the best one the first boy
[39:45] don't be giggling listen the first born
[39:51] like brother Brom said you know he's
[39:53] been story the little boy you know tug
[39:54] there's daddy's coat talents and you
[39:57] sure you got this thing right you got
[39:59] the blood over the doorpost and and
[40:01] we'll see how that symbolizes the cross
[40:03] go that went over the okay everybody got
[40:07] them you sure daddy you make sure you
[40:09] covered all that because I'm the
[40:10] firstborn in the fourteenth day of the
[40:13] first month that even as the Lord's
[40:15] Passover that's number one on the
[40:16] fifteenth day which is the next day of
[40:19] the same month is the feast of
[40:22] unleavened bread unto the Lord seven
[40:24] days now this one lasts for seven days
[40:26] basically it's going to be an eight-day
[40:29] feast Passover then seven days for
[40:34] unleavened bread unto the Lord seven
[40:37] days you must eat unleavened bread how
[40:38] many of you when you take communion that
[40:41] is unleavened bread how many would y'all
[40:42] would like to eat that every day Monica
[40:47] I will raise my hand to but I like I
[40:50] like it but but most people like a
[40:53] little leaven in there it'd be hard to
[40:55] eat a cheeseburger with with unleavened
[40:57] bread so but what but what's it doing
[41:02] it's tell there's something it's a
[41:04] symbol and we'll get into that a little
[41:06] bit later I just want you to see the
[41:08] feast days today so we don't know not
[41:10] here so long seven days you must eat
[41:12] unleavened bread there's gonna be no
[41:15] leaven in your whole house get it out
[41:18] get rid of it get rid of all the
[41:22] problems in our house one two three
[41:28] Oh anyway we'll get into that speaking
[41:31] of the statue a perfect man see
[41:35] everybody says what the Passover I'm
[41:37] born again everything is fine you know
[41:38] that's great
[41:39] but God wants more God you just got the
[41:43] baby here God wants that baby to grow
[41:49] little Jesus and the cradle couldn't die
[41:51] for me
[41:52] he had to grow and the 14th day of the
[41:57] first month is the Lord's Passover right
[41:58] number two on the fifteenth day of the
[42:00] same month is the feast of unleavened
[42:02] bread unto the Lord seven days you must
[42:05] eat unleavened bread now watch we'll get
[42:08] into all this but that's number two in
[42:09] the first day you shall have a holy
[42:11] convocation you don't do any work on the
[42:14] first day of the feast of unleavened
[42:16] bread but you shall offer an offering
[42:19] made by fire unto the Lord for seven
[42:21] days in the seventh day as a holy
[42:23] convocation so the first day in the
[42:25] seventh day you don't do anything no
[42:27] servile hour service work is to be done
[42:30] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[42:32] speak unto the children of Israel saying
[42:35] to them when you be coming to the land
[42:37] which I give unto you know this is one
[42:39] of the feasts that's tied to harvest
[42:40] there's a few of them this time to
[42:41] harvest and I want you to think about
[42:44] harvest not harvesting beans and
[42:47] potatoes and carrots harvesting is like
[42:51] by yourself
[42:55] listen God is gonna reap a harvest and
[42:58] it's us because the children of Israel
[43:04] saying to them when you come into the
[43:05] land which I'll give unto you and shall
[43:07] reap the harvest thereof watch this then
[43:10] you shall bring a sheaf of the first
[43:11] fruits of your harvest unto the priest
[43:13] now watch the first fruits that's the
[43:16] first thing that comes to maturity we
[43:18] have a field right now that's full of
[43:19] corn I got all kind of corn from knee
[43:22] high the way above head high the first
[43:26] fruits were the one that stands out the
[43:28] first fruit to me is the one that got
[43:30] the most nutrition the one that got the
[43:32] most a soul in light there's a lot of
[43:37] types here you're gonna have to dig them
[43:39] out yourself I can't get them all sheaf
[43:43] of the first fruits of your harvest unto
[43:45] the priest and he shall wave the sheaf
[43:47] before the Lord look to be accepted for
[43:51] you
[43:53] on the morrow after the south after the
[43:56] Sabbath so there has to be a Sabbath and
[43:58] tomorrow after the Sabbath now what was
[44:01] the morrow after the Sabbath during
[44:02] Jesus's time remember Jesus was dead
[44:04] Sabbath day his body was physically dead
[44:08] Saturday what was the day after Saturday
[44:12] Sunday when did he rise when did the
[44:16] firstfruits come out of the ground
[44:18] look it's just a wonderful time and he
[44:21] shall wave the sheaf before the Lord
[44:23] when Jesus Christ stepped out of that
[44:25] tomb and he said all power and heaven
[44:27] earth has been given unto me there was
[44:28] you preached there was your first fruits
[44:31] of the Resurrection and everything else
[44:33] behind him is depending on that
[44:35] resurrection so so the people look and
[44:42] he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord
[44:44] to be accepted for you my brother dev
[44:48] was talking this morning we were chosen
[44:50] listen you can be chosen by God the
[44:54] devil was chosen by God but you can't be
[44:58] chosen in Christ and not be Christ amen
[45:02] we were chosen in him before the
[45:04] foundation of the world so I put all of
[45:07] mine on him because it was accepted for
[45:10] me on the morrow after the Sabbath
[45:14] depreciate waybut and you shall offer
[45:16] that day when you wave the sheaf and he
[45:17] lamb without blemish of the first year
[45:20] for a burnt offering unto the Lord and
[45:21] the meat offering shall be two-tenths
[45:23] deal of fine flour mingled with oil and
[45:25] offering made by fire will get into all
[45:28] these symbols in a little while but I
[45:29] want you to see them all but watch this
[45:32] think of verse 14 you shall eat nothing
[45:38] you shall eat neither bread nor parts
[45:42] corn in our green ears until the self
[45:45] same day that you have brought an
[45:46] offering unto your God until you have
[45:51] come and received the baptism of the
[45:53] Holy Ghost and started living a life of
[45:55] Christ and start coming to church and
[45:58] listening to what's going on you ain't
[46:00] eating I'll just put that in plain
[46:03] English you ain't eatin
[46:05] oh you might be physically eating but
[46:07] all you're doing is helping this guy but
[46:09] when you spiritually eat you're required
[46:13] to wait until that first fruit comes
[46:16] forth and preaches you a message and
[46:21] then you receive from that message and
[46:23] what do you do you meet all right
[46:27] brought an offering unto your God it
[46:29] shall be a statute forever throughout
[46:31] your generations and all your dwellings
[46:35] so man is this not supposed to go away
[46:39] excuse me
[46:40] now watch this here's number four and
[46:44] you shall count in to you from tomorrow
[46:45] after the Sabbath now tomorrow after the
[46:48] Sabbath from the day that you brought
[46:51] the sheaf of the wave offering seven
[46:54] Sabbath's shall be complete now this is
[46:59] coming up to the feast of Pentecost
[47:03] Penta means what fifty all right so the
[47:10] feast of Pentecost you cease what is
[47:14] seven Sabbath's seven times seven is
[47:17] what all right but it's the day after
[47:20] the Sabbath is when you start that so it
[47:23] will be on the fiftieth day it kind of
[47:28] strange that the day of Pentecost 50
[47:34] days after Jesus Jesus came out of the
[47:36] tomb on the feast of firstfruits they
[47:39] listened they were literally we're going
[47:41] to go through this Jesus was then Jesus
[47:44] went to church
[47:53] a little dizzy there Jesus went to
[47:56] church even the Bible says as the custom
[48:00] that he was used to he went his act but
[48:05] he would go to church he would show up
[48:07] on these Sabbath days and on these feast
[48:10] days he would show up he showed up on
[48:13] the feast of unleavened bread and he
[48:15] said I am the bread of life
[48:17] you don't need to eat that anymore come
[48:21] and partake of me Oh you either labored
[48:25] and heavy laden and I'll give you and
[48:28] you shall counter to you from the morrow
[48:30] after the Sabbath from the day that you
[48:32] brought the sheaf of the wave offering
[48:34] seven Sabbath's shall be complete so you
[48:38] complete forty-nine days and then on the
[48:43] fiftieth day even unto the morrow what
[48:47] is that the day after show you number
[48:50] fifty days now that's why they caught
[48:53] this is called the feast of weeks are
[48:55] the feast of Pentecost because it counts
[48:58] weeks you count seven weeks seven sevens
[49:02] is 49 days 49 days and then the morrow
[49:06] after the 7/7 Sabbath show you number
[49:09] fifty days and you shall offer a new
[49:11] meat offering unto the warden now watch
[49:13] this right here because like I said
[49:17] we're going back over this I'm just
[49:19] trying to stoke your mind so maybe
[49:20] you'll start thinking about it remember
[49:23] it's always been unleavened bread it's
[49:25] always been an affliction and sorrowing
[49:28] and and the Passover killing of the lamb
[49:31] and and all these things you know these
[49:33] we would say horrible things eating
[49:35] unleavened bread and all that but watch
[49:38] this this is where Israel couldn't
[49:43] understand when this all happened
[49:44] because we're fixing to put leaven into
[49:47] this now let me ask you a question what
[49:53] was the Feast of Pentecost they baked
[49:57] two loaves of two tents deal which is a
[50:01] measure all right they shall be a fine
[50:04] flour they shall be baking with
[50:10] now we take leaven that sin in the Bible
[50:13] right but when we look on the day of
[50:19] Pentecost what happened God came down
[50:24] into some unleavened bread and fill them
[50:29] and bake them 120 in the upper room
[50:33] that's the same way he's doing menu he's
[50:36] taking it putting himself inside of you
[50:40] yeah you're levy you got eleven yeah you
[50:43] got sin but you know what God decided
[50:46] this is the way it's gonna be so he put
[50:49] it right here now we'll get into all
[50:50] that but maybe it'll help you look you
[50:53] and they shall be bacon they gotta go
[50:56] through fire hot fire to bake these
[51:01] bread what is going on what what are we
[51:04] gonna do rise we're gonna rise and they
[51:10] are the firstfruits unto the Lord and
[51:13] you show off with the bread seven lambs
[51:15] without blemish will get like I said
[51:16] we'll get into all this later I'm just
[51:17] reading this so you can mark it on your
[51:19] paper of marketing your Bible
[51:21] so y'all for all these things have a
[51:23] burnt offering unto the Lord with their
[51:24] meat offering the drink offering even an
[51:26] offering made by fire of sweet savoring
[51:28] to the Lord then you shall sacrifice one
[51:31] kid of the goats for a sin offering and
[51:33] two lambs of the first year for a
[51:36] sacrifice of peace offering and the
[51:38] priest shall wave them with the bread of
[51:40] the first-fruit because what happened on
[51:45] the day of Pentecost because the baptism
[51:48] of the Holy Ghost God said I'm coming
[51:52] back in spirit form and I'm going to God
[51:57] not go on my people I'm going in my
[52:00] people I'm going in and I'm gonna make
[52:03] they're gonna be loaves of bread walking
[52:06] around well I know they're gonna have
[52:07] leaven you got what listen we're all
[52:09] sinners saved by grace maybe some of
[52:13] you're not
[52:15] and the priest shall wave them what was
[52:18] waived under that Pentecost 120 load
[52:20] Jesus's were waved to the people they
[52:23] said hey I'm starting something here but
[52:29] remember there's your four feast and
[52:32] they happened in the month of April May
[52:35] and June somewhere in there everybody
[52:37] got that that's four of them right
[52:42] Passover unleavened bread was the next
[52:44] day firstfruits was the Sabbath after
[52:47] the crop started coming in and your
[52:51] fourth is the day of Pentecost now the
[52:54] day of Pentecost it's when God came down
[52:57] like I said before and went into the
[52:59] people right and that was God that was
[53:06] Jesus produced Passover he was part of
[53:10] unleavened bread he was part of the
[53:11] firstfruits and he sure enough was part
[53:13] of the pentacle of Pentecost but then
[53:16] now we're going to have a long gap we're
[53:21] going to have two thousand years of a
[53:24] gap since Pentecost back in went a t30
[53:29] there's been two thousand years that God
[53:33] has waited because the next three feast
[53:35] are in the fall and Jesus is not going
[53:41] to do those three feet oh yeah he's
[53:46] gonna be a part of them but he's not
[53:49] here to do him it's gonna be done
[53:51] through me and you the trumpet of the
[53:57] Lord shall sound in time shall be no
[53:59] more
[54:00] he shall proclaim on the self same day
[54:02] the priest shall wave the bread and on
[54:04] the South same day then it may be a holy
[54:06] convocation unto you she'll do no
[54:08] servile work therein it shall be a
[54:09] statute forever and all your dwellings
[54:11] throughout your generations and when you
[54:14] reap the harvest of your land thou shalt
[54:16] not make clean reddit's of the corners
[54:18] of thy field you know why because
[54:20] there's 144,000 it's going to have to
[54:22] get some of this food
[54:24] man don't clean your corners why because
[54:26] what does the corner that's what Ruth
[54:27] was doing
[54:28] Ruth was gleaning the corners it was
[54:31] made for it was made for the outsider it
[54:34] was made for the person that was still
[54:35] here neither shalt thou gather any
[54:39] gleaning of the harvest leave it get the
[54:43] stock get the good stuff cuz that's what
[54:48] I'm going to what harvest thou shalt
[54:50] lead them unto the poor and to the
[54:53] stranger I am the Lord your God and the
[54:57] Lord spake unto Moses saying now
[54:59] remember this was the first month
[55:01] through the second month into the fifty
[55:04] days of Pentecost everybody got that say
[55:05] man wake up right pray a little bit
[55:14] longer next time
[55:15] okay I like what brother brother um
[55:19] dartie he gets up and he puts him big
[55:22] old hands up I thought man I could just
[55:26] get under them wings sometimes like God
[55:28] raised them big old hands up so what's
[55:31] gonna happen is now we're going to the
[55:34] seventh month now you say oh the seventh
[55:37] month is January February March and oh
[55:39] you've already started wrong seven thank
[55:44] you it's October we know that but for
[55:46] the newer ones here April May June July
[55:50] what September October so this is a fall
[55:55] feast which has to do with some of
[55:58] harvest we'll get into the every one of
[56:02] these we're going to take each one but
[56:04] now we're in the seventh month
[56:05] we're in October our October in their
[56:08] seventh month in the first day of the
[56:11] month so you have a Sabbath a memorial
[56:14] of blowing of trumpets and holy
[56:16] convocation you shall do no servile work
[56:19] therein but you shall offer an offering
[56:21] made by fire unto the Lord so there's
[56:23] what the Feast of Trumpets that's number
[56:27] five under the Feast of Trumpets what is
[56:30] the trumpet is they blowing now remember
[56:33] the Lord shall descend from heaven with
[56:35] a shout and the voice and the trumpet
[56:36] god from your neck
[56:37] we're gonna hear it's a trumpet it's a
[56:46] message what does a trumpet do listen
[56:51] before there were cell phones when was
[56:54] that the kids were going wow no cell
[56:57] phones any of you remember not having a
[57:02] cell phone Adam you do not you might not
[57:10] have had one but your mom and daddy did
[57:13] but listen before communication all
[57:16] communication was by what you made a
[57:19] certain noise even in the Calvary you
[57:22] remember you watch some old movies they
[57:23] didn't John Wayne didn't pull out his
[57:25] Motorola and go we need to charge maybe
[57:32] wake you up a little bit but now what do
[57:34] you do he said
[57:35] sound the alarm charge and then they
[57:37] don't hear they go after the cowboys and
[57:41] Indians so you know running now you
[57:42] understand what I mean but there's a
[57:44] certain one for retreat there's a
[57:45] certain one for moving left there's a
[57:47] certain cuz you couldn't you can hear
[57:48] the what the voice of the trumpet the
[57:52] voice of the trumpet don't listen for
[57:57] [Music]

[58:02] tells you something the Bible tells it
[58:05] for trumpet makes an uncertain sound you
[58:08] go what what is that man talking about
[58:14] what is that person what do you mean
[58:18] yeah listen to the right trumpet and
[58:25] also on the tenth day of this seventh
[58:26] month there shall be a day of atonement
[58:28] now there's your there's number six day
[58:32] of atonement
[58:32] now remember watch this you shall
[58:35] afflict your souls it is a time that you
[58:39] do not kill anything but you make an
[58:44] atonement an offering made by fire an
[58:47] offering made by fire into the Lord
[58:50] because you're mourning
[58:53] not the fresh kill your morning what
[58:58] happened
[58:59] and Passover you watch the forum when we
[59:03] get into this the atonement you atone
[59:05] for your sin the priest makes an
[59:08] atonement sacrifice Jesus Christ made
[59:11] the atoning sacrifice but you're gonna
[59:13] but you gonna have to you gonna have to
[59:15] go with me because remember he's not
[59:16] here those feasts are done on that
[59:19] harvest time through a bride and this
[59:24] may be hard for a lot of you to
[59:25] understand but this world is being
[59:28] judged by the bride of Jesus Christ the
[59:33] Bible says that the Saints will judge
[59:35] the earth I've told you many times
[59:40] before you and I are the cause of a lot
[59:44] of things that are going on around here
[59:48] because when we leave you don't want to
[59:53] be here you don't want to be here
[59:56] because the mercy now the atonement is
[1:00:00] being made to this earth by the bride
[1:00:02] being here everybody got that because
[1:00:07] we're here
[1:00:08] God can't lay the plagues out he can't
[1:00:12] turn the devil loose on this world like
[1:00:14] he's gonna do when you and me leave out
[1:00:15] of this place amen so that don't make us
[1:00:19] special people but I'm special because
[1:00:21] he said I'm special amen I'm special
[1:00:24] because he said I'm special and then
[1:00:27] also on the tenth day of the seventh
[1:00:29] month that she made a man Toman it shall
[1:00:32] be a holy convocation unto you and you
[1:00:34] shall afflict your souls and offer an
[1:00:36] offering made by fire unto the Lord and
[1:00:38] you shall do no work in that same day it
[1:00:40] looks like they never worked but they
[1:00:44] did get some work some look somewhere
[1:00:46] and you should do no work in that same
[1:00:49] day for it is a day of atonement and
[1:00:50] that's number six to make an atonement
[1:00:52] for you before the Lord your God for
[1:00:55] whatsoever now watch how important this
[1:00:57] is for whatsoever soul it be that shall
[1:01:01] not be afflicted in that same day he
[1:01:04] shall be cut off
[1:01:07] that's not the worst part
[1:01:09] read the next verse and whatsoever soul
[1:01:13] it be that doeth any work in that same
[1:01:16] day that same soul will I destroy from
[1:01:19] among his people you shall do no manner
[1:01:25] of work it shall be a statute forever
[1:01:33] I'm trying to read
[1:01:37] I'm trying thank you it shall be a
[1:01:41] statute forever throughout your
[1:01:43] generations and all your dwellings it
[1:01:45] shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest and
[1:01:48] you shall afflict your souls in the
[1:01:51] ninth day of the month that even from
[1:01:54] even to even that's what now does that
[1:01:56] mean evening to evening nobody got that
[1:01:59] for me evening to evening
[1:02:01] you shall flick your soul in the ninth
[1:02:03] day of the month that even even unto
[1:02:06] evening shall you celebrate your Sabbath
[1:02:09] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:02:11] though this is the last one same month
[1:02:15] in the fifteenth day of this seventh
[1:02:17] month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles
[1:02:19] for seven days unto the Lord on the
[1:02:26] first day shall be a holy convocation
[1:02:27] you shall do no servile work there in
[1:02:29] seven days you shall offer an offering
[1:02:32] made by fire into the Lord on the eighth
[1:02:34] day now this is where brother Branham
[1:02:37] talks about the eighth day because let
[1:02:41] me give you a little background to some
[1:02:42] of the ones that are new the set of
[1:02:44] seven means complete right you got seven
[1:02:46] Church Ages you got seven messengers you
[1:02:48] got seven seals you got seven vials you
[1:02:50] got seven plagues you got seven lifts
[1:02:51] and seven 2007 the other all right so
[1:02:54] seven is a completion but remember in
[1:02:56] looking at your Bible the Millennium is
[1:03:00] still the seventh day seventh day is
[1:03:04] time if I got that seventh day is time
[1:03:09] the eighth day which there is no eighth
[1:03:12] day the Beatle thing about it
[1:03:17] it's kind of strange now that that the
[1:03:19] world picks up on religious things and
[1:03:22] then they throw it in a song the days of
[1:03:24] Aquarius over by the fifth dimension
[1:03:26] where'd that come from
[1:03:28] the fifth dimension hmm okay anyway but
[1:03:34] you see it that there was there is an
[1:03:36] eighth day but it's just the first day
[1:03:38] all over again oh we were showing
[1:03:39] downstairs in the Sunday School class
[1:03:41] there's your a door what is the sign of
[1:03:42] eternity it's an it's the number eight
[1:03:45] laid down but you have no you have no
[1:03:49] stopping place so if you're born again
[1:03:52] today you're in the eighth day your soul
[1:03:54] is in the eighth day you're born again
[1:03:56] how much more eternal can you get you're
[1:03:58] just working on this guy because he's
[1:04:00] still in the seventh day the holy
[1:04:02] convocation he's still in the seventh
[1:04:04] day because what is the Feast of
[1:04:06] Tabernacles this right here not the
[1:04:13] Feast of Tabernacles the Feast of this
[1:04:16] tabernacle because what happens is is
[1:04:18] they go and build him a booth and they
[1:04:20] go out there and sit in it for seven
[1:04:22] days you saw that didn't you dadandan
[1:04:25] when they were in Israel they saw they
[1:04:26] just put these little boost out in the
[1:04:28] yard and they go set in them well see
[1:04:30] what that will see what that symbolizes
[1:04:33] later on seven days you shall offer an
[1:04:35] offering made by fire in the Lord on the
[1:04:36] eighth day shall be a holy convocation
[1:04:38] unto you and you shall offer an offering
[1:04:40] made by fire into the Lord let me get
[1:04:43] back to my point time runs all the way
[1:04:45] to where the Millennium is literally a
[1:04:49] thousand years of time but now when John
[1:04:53] saw this holy city coming down out of
[1:04:56] heaven the Bible says that God says time
[1:04:59] is no longer so time will blend into
[1:05:03] eternity there'll be no there'll be no
[1:05:05] time in the new home that we go to and
[1:05:07] listen folks we know one thing's for
[1:05:09] sure it's not up there this is where
[1:05:14] it's gonna be John saw the holy city
[1:05:16] coming down out of heaven and sitting on
[1:05:20] a mountain this is our witness Adam's
[1:05:25] earth before they saw the fallen this
[1:05:29] well we're going back to be restored
[1:05:31] back to that so on the eighth day should
[1:05:35] be a holy convocation into use y'all for
[1:05:37] an offering made by fire unto the Lord
[1:05:38] it is a solemn assembly and you shall do
[1:05:42] no servile work therein these are the
[1:05:45] Feast of the Lord which you shall
[1:05:46] proclaim to be holy convocations to
[1:05:49] offer an offering made by fire unto the
[1:05:51] Lord a burnt offering a meat offering a
[1:05:53] sacrifice a drink offering everything
[1:05:55] upon his Day I'll just read it from here
[1:06:10] thank you besides the Sabbath of the
[1:06:13] Lord and besides your gifts and besides
[1:06:15] are your vows and besides all your
[1:06:17] freewill offerings which you give unto
[1:06:19] the Lord see this is a not just well
[1:06:21] this is all I gotta do and that's the
[1:06:24] way it is today a Christian was always
[1:06:25] gonna do come Church I read my daily
[1:06:30] devotion twice no he wants you to look
[1:06:37] at all that stuff he told you freewill
[1:06:38] offerings and all the things that you
[1:06:39] give to God it's a daily walk with the
[1:06:42] Lord
[1:06:43] so now let's finish this we'll finish it
[1:06:44] up also on the fifteenth day of the
[1:06:46] seventh month now this is the Feast of
[1:06:48] still of Tabernacles he's telling them
[1:06:50] what to do when you have gathered in the
[1:06:54] fruit of the land you shall keep a feast
[1:06:55] into the Lord seven days now this is
[1:06:57] tied to the harvest on the first day
[1:07:00] shall be a Sabbath and on the eighth day
[1:07:02] shall be a Sabbath and you shall take
[1:07:04] you on your first day the bowels of
[1:07:05] goodly trees branches of palm trees and
[1:07:08] the bowels of thick trees and willows of
[1:07:11] the brook
[1:07:12] hey where's Jonas where Jonas y'all
[1:07:16] built one of those up here at the cabin
[1:07:19] you built one of those you took boughs
[1:07:22] of trees there wasn't any palm trees
[1:07:23] I've ever take took every stick that was
[1:07:25] in the woods laying on the ground and
[1:07:27] made him a teepee right well brother
[1:07:32] Gary said three of them I think Luke was
[1:07:34] involved in all three right Luke was
[1:07:36] down there trying to saw a tree with a
[1:07:39] Leatherman
[1:07:40] little scratch knife and he's got a tree
[1:07:43] this big around he's going
[1:07:44] we're Oh Jonas did too I told him I said
[1:07:48] hey make me a toothpick but there this
[1:07:53] is what you got to do you got to bring
[1:07:54] that in and it looked good they did look
[1:07:57] good in their burger they did and I went
[1:07:59] a state under during rainstorm but they
[1:08:01] look alright and no matter of fact I
[1:08:03] couldn't have got under any of the three
[1:08:04] so a lot of me would he got wet like
[1:08:08] when we went camping one time with Aaron
[1:08:10] and he took this little bitty tent that
[1:08:11] was made for somebody like Jonas and he
[1:08:13] tried to sleep in it that was more of
[1:08:15] him outside than it was inside
[1:08:20] you got any sideways and your feet were
[1:08:22] still hanging out I'm not telling the
[1:08:24] story amen
[1:08:26] because we were trying to see if the
[1:08:28] Bears would grab ahold of us but when
[1:08:31] the bear grabbed ahold of his foot he
[1:08:33] had to be a real big bear to get him out
[1:08:35] of that thing so anyway now to wake up a
[1:08:38] little bit so they look and I love what
[1:08:43] this this types because what is Israel
[1:08:46] gonna do in the Millennium now you and I
[1:08:49] don't build houses but the Bible says
[1:08:52] that you'll build houses and you'll
[1:08:54] inhabit them telling Israel this is the
[1:08:58] time the type of the Millennium which is
[1:09:01] still the seventh day you've got to keep
[1:09:03] it in the seventh day and you shall take
[1:09:05] on the first day the bowels of goodly
[1:09:07] trees the branches the palm trees and
[1:09:08] the balance of thick trees and the
[1:09:10] Willows of the brook and you shall
[1:09:11] rejoice before the Lord your God seven
[1:09:13] days and look they weren't they didn't
[1:09:19] put these little things in secret they
[1:09:22] put them out there where everybody could
[1:09:24] see it you put your life every day you
[1:09:28] put your tabernacle every day out there
[1:09:31] so that the world can see it so what are
[1:09:34] they looking at that's my question to
[1:09:36] you what are they looking at brothers
[1:09:39] and sisters what are they looking at
[1:09:41] this world is in a chaos they just need
[1:09:45] God
[1:09:47] and we're the only god they're gonna see
[1:09:50] if that's too strong for you just
[1:09:52] swallow and take it and you shall keep
[1:09:55] it a feast until the Lord seven days in
[1:09:57] the year shall be a statute forever in
[1:09:59] your generations you shall celebrate it
[1:10:02] in the seventh month now what is the
[1:10:04] seventh month it's harvest month you
[1:10:08] shall dwell in booths seven days all
[1:10:10] that are Israelites borne shall dwell in
[1:10:12] booth everybody
[1:10:14] that your generations may know that I
[1:10:16] made the children of Israel to dwell in
[1:10:19] booths when I brought them out of the
[1:10:21] land of Egypt I am the Lord your God and
[1:10:23] Moses declared unto the children of
[1:10:25] Israel the Feast of the Lord so you got
[1:10:31] the Feast of what Passover unleavened
[1:10:34] bread firstfruits and Pentecost in the
[1:10:39] first part of the year then you have a
[1:10:42] long period of time before you have the
[1:10:44] other feast which are the Feast of
[1:10:47] Trumpets
[1:10:47] the Feast of Atonement and the Feast of
[1:10:52] Tabernacles and then the prophet of God
[1:10:54] tells us that you and I are feasting
[1:10:56] under the Feast of Tabernacles because
[1:10:57] it's God tabernacled in human flesh amen
[1:11:02] now we'll bring one more thing out keep
[1:11:05] these and I'm gonna leave these here if
[1:11:07] you don't want another one there's one
[1:11:09] more thing I want to go to them they
[1:11:10] don't have it but let's go to second
[1:11:12] let's go to Exodus 23 because there's
[1:11:17] one point I want to make before we leave
[1:11:20] and we'll get into this and this is
[1:11:21] really good but it's gonna be after we
[1:11:23] finish everything but I want to stoke
[1:11:26] your your get you kind of stirred up and
[1:11:31] say well what is that about
[1:11:32] because the God told them in chapter 23
[1:11:37] of the book of Exodus chapter 14 there's
[1:11:41] three feast that the male's had to keep
[1:11:44] every year three feast every male had to
[1:11:48] keep three times thou shalt keep a feast
[1:11:51] unto me in the year thou shalt keep the
[1:11:55] feast of unleavened bread thou shalt eat
[1:11:58] unleavened bread seven days as I
[1:11:59] commanded thee in the
[1:12:01] I'm appointed of the month Abib which is
[1:12:02] April for in it thou camest out from
[1:12:05] Egypt and none shall appear before me
[1:12:07] empty now listen the whole underlying
[1:12:10] meaning is is the male's had to come to
[1:12:13] all three of these feasts so Jesus had
[1:12:16] to come to all three of these feast
[1:12:21] nobody got that same man so he had to go
[1:12:25] because he was a male child he had to go
[1:12:28] to these three feast which was
[1:12:30] unleavened bread let's just read it
[1:12:32] right here unleavened bread and their
[1:12:36] verse 16 is a feast of harvest which is
[1:12:38] the firstfruits he was the first one
[1:12:42] ever born like that hello I mean birds
[1:12:48] and birds do you know of okay the feast
[1:12:52] of harvest the first fruits of the labor
[1:12:53] which thou has sown in the field and the
[1:12:56] feast of ingathering which is the end of
[1:12:59] the year when thou has gathered in thy
[1:13:01] Labor's out of the field three times in
[1:13:03] the year all the males shall appear
[1:13:07] before the Lord now remember and I'll
[1:13:12] read it there's a key there it comes up
[1:13:15] again in second chronicles but we won't
[1:13:17] read that you can't come empty-handed
[1:13:22] you can't come to this feast males
[1:13:25] empty-handed you had to bring something
[1:13:28] to the feast gives you an opportunity to
[1:13:32] bring something see I want you to bring
[1:13:36] something to this feast that we're
[1:13:38] having you are the one these are the
[1:13:41] feast of the Lord but guess what where's
[1:13:44] the Lord inside you we as believers in
[1:13:52] the end time the journey of a believer
[1:13:54] is that God indwells his people now not
[1:13:58] that he just annoys people he indwells
[1:14:01] himself in us you and I the bride of
[1:14:05] Jesus Christ we go to every one of these
[1:14:10] feasts and hardly ever know it
[1:14:15] hardly ever know it but they're there in
[1:14:18] the Bible and we're gonna start through
[1:14:20] it next Sunday Lord willing and we'll
[1:14:23] take each one and show how it fit Israel
[1:14:28] how it fit the Lord Jesus when he was
[1:14:30] here and how it fits the Lord Jesus
[1:14:33] inside of you
[1:14:35] Passover I want to ask you a question
[1:14:39] today as has the Death Angel passed over
[1:14:43] you you got to take that atonement blood
[1:14:48] you got to take the killing of that lamb
[1:14:51] and you got to put that blood over your
[1:14:53] doorpost over your door post so that
[1:14:58] Satan can't enter in and that you come
[1:15:02] to a place to receive the baptism of the
[1:15:06] Holy Ghost
[1:15:08] because what does the Bible tell us that
[1:15:10] the musicians go in come the Bible tells
[1:15:12] us in acts 2:38 it says repent sometimes
[1:15:17] we forget that repent and be baptized in
[1:15:22] the name of Jesus Christ because that's
[1:15:25] the only aim God ever had God's name's
[1:15:27] not father God's names not son God's
[1:15:32] names not Holy Ghost
[1:15:33] those are titles to a name there's only
[1:15:36] one name the Bible says that the whole
[1:15:41] family of God you know the family of
[1:15:46] Samuel way Dale the second to the family
[1:15:51] of Samuel Wade Dale knows he's a father
[1:15:54] he's my father
[1:15:56] literally my father right now I hope
[1:16:03] number one he's not gonna pass away but
[1:16:06] he's gotta write a will and that will
[1:16:09] says I Samuel Wade Dale gives to all his
[1:16:16] possessions to Sam your way down second
[1:16:20] but now what it but I want if it's a
[1:16:23] head I father
[1:16:29] or he writes me a hundred thousand mum
[1:16:33] would he writes me a hundred thousand
[1:16:35] dollar check and he signs it father
[1:16:39] what's the bank gonna do with that come
[1:16:42] on people let's talk about this for a
[1:16:44] man watch the Bible watch them
[1:16:45] what's the Bible what the people gonna
[1:16:46] do so - nothing zero ly why whose father
[1:16:53] hoochie daddy but I got him I got our
[1:16:58] daddy that's got a name oh I got a daddy
[1:17:03] he's got a name his name yeah we call
[1:17:07] him father we call him the son of God
[1:17:11] we call him the sweet Holy Ghost but
[1:17:15] he's only got one name and when Jesus
[1:17:18] stood up that day and he said repent go
[1:17:21] all the world preach the gospel bring
[1:17:24] good tidings and baptize in the name of
[1:17:26] the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:17:29] Holy Ghost Father a name the son tonight
[1:17:35] as Holy goes to name what is the name
[1:17:39] what is the name of the Father what is
[1:17:42] the name of the son what is the name of
[1:17:44] the Holy Ghost Jesus said I'll send you
[1:17:46] another comforter and I'll send him in
[1:17:47] my name my name so what was Jesus
[1:17:56] telling them exactly what Peter told
[1:17:59] them on the day of Pentecost read your
[1:18:02] Bible
[1:18:03] accident at in the book of Acts acts
[1:18:06] 2:38 says repent we forget that part
[1:18:10] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:18:14] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:18:17] sins and you shall what I promised
[1:18:21] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:18:24] that promise isn't to you and your
[1:18:29] children
[1:18:31] and as many ER and I was as far off as
[1:18:34] you could get
[1:18:36] most of us were so he was talking to me
[1:18:40] as many as far off as me as the LORD thy
[1:18:43] God shall call so that's why the correct
[1:18:48] baptism is not father son Holy Ghost
[1:18:49] that was created by the Catholic Church
[1:18:52] hey man it's in the history look it up
[1:18:55] the Catholic Church decided today we're
[1:18:59] gonna use Father Son Holy Ghost for a
[1:19:00] baptism which that is not true
[1:19:03] like I said what family you getting
[1:19:06] baptized into ah Sam you're down ii give
[1:19:11] my possessions to joshua Rockdale and
[1:19:15] Han Elizabeth day sorry buddy
[1:19:17] you know what that takes funds and it
[1:19:20] directs them right to wear that name is
[1:19:22] so I want funds
[1:19:25] I want funds from my father to go
[1:19:30] directly to me cuz I did what he said
[1:19:36] alright let stand up we don't have to
[1:19:38] kitty son scare away BR away the new
[1:19:41] people we ought to be excited
[1:19:48] truth has come that's a baptism with
[1:19:59] promise it's a promise that you'll
[1:20:04] receive that fourth feast the Feast of
[1:20:09] Pentecost that baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:12] not a day jesus said we're not in a day
[1:20:14] now well we're not in a day we're in a
[1:20:19] day of rest yes but remember the Bible
[1:20:22] talks about the day of the Lord it's not
[1:20:24] one 24-hour day this is the day of the
[1:20:28] Lord where the Lord is there is Liberty
[1:20:30] where the Lord is there is this day that
[1:20:33] we live in you and I have been caught up
[1:20:36] in Revelations for as John was caught up
[1:20:39] in that open door you and I had been
[1:20:42] caught up into something different
[1:20:44] than what the world gets that's why I
[1:20:48] took a profit to bring these things to
[1:20:50] us we Revere the Prophet as being one
[1:20:53] that brought us to Revelation but he's
[1:20:56] not God he was born a sinner just like
[1:20:59] me and you just like he lied you just
[1:21:00] like itll I should just like Jeremiah
[1:21:03] just like Isaiah we even talked about
[1:21:06] Paul well there had to be a prophet in
[1:21:10] the end time according to Malachi 4:2
[1:21:12] straighten all these things up that man
[1:21:16] man had decided this is the way we're
[1:21:20] gonna do it but God didn't decide that
[1:21:23] because you know what I talked to a
[1:21:25] Mormon not too long well she used to
[1:21:27] work for me years ago they changed their
[1:21:29] Bible they changed it often kinda like a
[1:21:32] calendar they change it all the time
[1:21:34] this thing's never changed it never will
[1:21:37] change it is eternal the Bible tells us
[1:21:41] in Hebrews 13:8 is that Jesus Christ is
[1:21:44] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:21:47] amen god bless you will get into these
[1:21:49] will get into the Passover next next
[1:21:52] Sunday we just pray that the Lord will
[1:21:55] help us all like I said I'm gonna leave
[1:21:57] this right here in case anybody wants to
[1:22:00] take in with them and we will start
[1:22:02] we'll have a little calendar but
[1:22:04] remember these become rituals though to
[1:22:09] Israel they became just daddy yeah you
[1:22:16] gotta go to church today try to talk to
[1:22:19] Leo my kids like when I was to keep me
[1:22:22] in attendance with the kid
[1:22:23] my mom and daddy drugged us they drugged
[1:22:26] us they drugged us the church on Sunday
[1:22:29] and drugged us to church on Wednesday
[1:22:32] but I'm off drugs now
[1:22:35] and I come when I want a man right dad
[1:22:40] yeah you your mom and dad drugs you dude
[1:22:42] anything drug you everywhere now you
[1:22:45] offered him drug and you enjoy coming to
[1:22:48] church you enjoy coming to fellowship
[1:22:51] with people of like precious faith and
[1:22:52] man it's good to see a change in
[1:22:59] somebody's life especially young kids I
[1:23:01] I told Michael sitting around there out
[1:23:06] and out around the fire the other night
[1:23:10] singing we were singing gospel songs
[1:23:13] doesn't matter how it sounded I think it
[1:23:16] sounded good didn't you
[1:23:17] those act was playing the guitar Richard
[1:23:20] playing the bass and brother Aaron was
[1:23:22] planning to get time and we just sat
[1:23:23] around some of y'all missed a lot of
[1:23:25] good fellowship and we sang songs and
[1:23:32] the Lord just came among us and we just
[1:23:35] kept singing and kept singing kept
[1:23:38] singing to me that's fellowship
[1:23:42] that's a Father's Day fellowship but we
[1:23:46] can fellowship with that father every
[1:23:47] day we don't have to wait to a calendar
[1:23:49] day on the year see Israel had to wait
[1:23:52] to a calendar day on the year because
[1:23:53] this was there this was the way they
[1:23:55] were set up
[1:23:56] but when Jesus came he said hey I'm the
[1:23:58] bridge you need to eat now I'm the
[1:24:00] Passover lamb I'm the unleavened bread
[1:24:02] I'm all these different things amen
[1:24:06] but you know what they did Israel just
[1:24:09] kept on doing and they're still doing
[1:24:11] today trying to do Passover unleavened
[1:24:16] bread they still celebrate these things
[1:24:18] and there's different words for that but
[1:24:19] we'll talk about a little bit later on
[1:24:21] but god bless you we're going to like I
[1:24:24] said this is this is something that when
[1:24:26] we enter in it should be the same way we
[1:24:28] entered in entered in with the journey
[1:24:31] of Abram that you can say man that
[1:24:34] happened to me because the feast days
[1:24:38] how can you take them out of the Bible
[1:24:40] you can't take them out they were put
[1:24:42] there for our information for us to use
[1:24:46] and see how a natural people live by
[1:24:49] but it also became to them a ritual not
[1:24:53] a feast let's not let this that we have
[1:24:57] become a ritual and a half-two and I got
[1:25:02] to and you know it's like June's always
[1:25:06] said we we we know that what the Bible
[1:25:10] says about hair and dress about how
[1:25:13] woman should have long hair and not cut
[1:25:15] her hair and the women should not wear
[1:25:16] pants or garments according to to a man
[1:25:20] and June's of course students in law
[1:25:25] thought we brainwashed her I said no the
[1:25:28] Lord did amen so the things we did God
[1:25:33] is a sacrifice even even the men the
[1:25:37] things we do is a sacrifice very tiny
[1:25:41] sacrifice from when that man crawled up
[1:25:43] on that cross and died for me and you I
[1:25:46] told that girl the other day at the at
[1:25:48] the dentist office she was complaining
[1:25:51] because her preacher preached longer
[1:25:53] than 15 minutes
[1:25:54] oh my right y'all hope y'all know part
[1:25:57] of the story you know all of them but
[1:25:58] you know part of it my righteous
[1:25:59] indignation got up all right therefore I
[1:26:02] told her what I thought I pulled that
[1:26:05] thing out of my mouth I said lady that
[1:26:08] man that you say you worship hung for
[1:26:11] three hours on a cross nails in his
[1:26:14] hands he had a crown of thorns on his
[1:26:16] head he was beat to a pulp can't you
[1:26:19] stay 15 minutes and listen to somebody
[1:26:22] talk about that man she hate me if you
[1:26:26] want to sorry but there's a truth he had
[1:26:32] he hung three hours for me and you can't
[1:26:34] we sit for an hour hour and a half and
[1:26:36] listen to how that man saved your soul
[1:26:39] and how that you can continue to walk
[1:26:41] through this world and not have to worry
[1:26:44] about all these things and everybody
[1:26:45] else worries about God bless you let's
[1:26:47] sing a song we'll be all day
[1:26:52] that raised Jesus from the dead well in
[1:26:56] years

[1:31:09] good job Tom short folks we either got
[1:31:14] to get in or get out
[1:31:15] leaves no playing around this thing is
[1:31:19] coming down to a close my look what's
[1:31:20] happening out in the world I mean who
[1:31:23] would have thought even a year ago that
[1:31:27] the world will be in a condition that's
[1:31:28] in now who would've thought even six
[1:31:29] months ago that the world in the
[1:31:31] condition is in now but nothing can
[1:31:35] happen without God protecting his bride
[1:31:40] nothing you think oh we're in trouble
[1:31:43] now we're not in trouble we're right
[1:31:45] where we're supposed to be we're right
[1:31:47] in that covenant that he said I'll never
[1:31:51] leave you and I'll never forsake you so
[1:31:53] god bless you let's bow our head
[1:31:55] Heavenly Father we pray that you touch
[1:31:57] us today Lord in all of our bodies Lord
[1:32:01] as we go out the door Lord may we feel a
[1:32:03] rejuvenation Lord from the word that
[1:32:06] we've heard today knowing that father
[1:32:07] several thousand years ago you told
[1:32:10] these people to do a certain thing and
[1:32:12] Lord they started doing it and then they
[1:32:15] they kind of got out of doing it because
[1:32:18] they thought it was a ritual father we
[1:32:20] pray Lord that no one in this building
[1:32:22] thinks that being a Christian has to be
[1:32:24] a ritual if something Lord as our as we
[1:32:27] talked about sister Jun Lord is telling
[1:32:28] their family what what what more can I
[1:32:31] do
[1:32:32] it's not what less can I do
[1:32:35] it's what more can I do for you Lord
[1:32:38] what greater things can we do with
[1:32:40] cutting out all the sin of the world and
[1:32:42] all the different things and the Bible
[1:32:44] tells us that if we look like the world
[1:32:46] and act like the world in the world's in
[1:32:48] us but if we look different and act
[1:32:50] different talk different then we know
[1:32:53] that there's a different spirit that
[1:32:55] same spirit that raised up Jesus from
[1:32:58] the dead is dwelling in the hearts of
[1:33:02] individuals in the end time father go
[1:33:05] with us on the way home sanctifies for
[1:33:08] this journey
[1:33:09] we come back together on Wednesday Lord

[1:33:21] and all the ministers in the building
[1:33:23] Lord the Deacons and elders the ones
[1:33:25] that have something to do with the
[1:33:27] church service Lord we pray that you
[1:33:29] just be with each one blessing musicians
[1:33:31] and the ones Lord that are sitting in
[1:33:33] the pews father we pray that you just as
[1:33:35] the wheels turn on the way home Lord
[1:33:37] that they'll be singing Amazing Grace
[1:33:39] how sweet the sound that saved a wretch
[1:33:42] like me father give us this day our
[1:33:43] daily bread forgive us of our sins in
[1:33:46] Jesus name we pray amen
[1:33:48] you're dismissed that's spirit that
[1:33:54] raised Jesus from the dead
