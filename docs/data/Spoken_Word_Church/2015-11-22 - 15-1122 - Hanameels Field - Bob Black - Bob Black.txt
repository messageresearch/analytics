========================================

Jeremiah chapter 32 so we were just reading in Leviticus chapter 25 how let me just summarize quick so ever every seven years you grow your crops and whatnot for six years and then every seven years you gotta rest yeah then 7 times 7 is 49 over 49 years then on the on the tenth month or the seventh month on the tenth day if somebody would blow the trumpet I go out and throw the trumpet and that means that they did you hear the 50th you get to go free now now bring that on forward as if there's a up you know when you're looking at day in 70 weeks one of the things that to kind of put everything in context it's that one of the reasons that God sent them down in the battle on as if you read through think about Jeremiah 34 35 that Jeremiah begin to tell them look they sit on this it's the seventh year let all your that you're the people that are working for you and what not let him go free and and they did they let him go free they said we're going to obey the world order and and but then they change their mind they said no never mind we're gonna we're going to pull them all back into bondage and and and take all these you know are the people that would have been set free and whatnot and go back on our work and not obey the word of the Lord and then you know there's a few chapters after that phone Jeremiah God tells Jeremih to go go talk to the sons of the ring cab the reek of ice who their father had told him to to abstain from wine and so Jeremiah goes assist down in front of him and he puts mine in from them and says drink the wine and they said no I father told us not to drink wine so we're not going to do it and all these other things they told us to dwell in tents and all these all these kind of things and it becomes an example to the people of Israel Jeremiah goes back and says look the the children recap can obey their father and you can't obey your father they can obey what their father told them to do but your father told you to obey all these Commandments and things in Leviticus 25 and elsewhere to not put huge burdens on your brothers and those kind of things so God sends them down into battle on to make sure that this rest comes to pass for 70 years so put kind of put that in context so and you know you can run that as you know go to brenham tall you can run that that 50 jubilee all down through the the Bible until it comes out in 1977 Milgram said that was the 70th Jubilee of the Leviticus 25 8 which is there a 49 so it's important to get that get that straight now it is 249 and then we can go free right but anyway I want I want to kind of go through Jeremiah chapter 32 before we start reading through this this whole chapter let's just go over and reverently Lord God me thank you for another opportunity to come into your to the house of the Lord to serve you and to hear about you or I pray as we go through this chapter or that you'll open it to us Lord Jesus be with the services our brother burly's with brother Wade but all the weeks over there granite mortgage will be with the services here at I church board and open the eyes about heart to hear you know more about you go Jesus and they grow closer to you to walk with you Lord we ask in the name of Jesus Christ yes yes city thank you it's good to watch out for one America all right now so so Jeremiah just to put put things in perspective aware where are the nation is right now they've been a battle to all these different countries flip flopping back and forth between the syria and egypt for from many years i got some numbers down ten hands of judah he got afraid years ago that the rules going to attack other things he goes down to assyria and appeals to their king TIG laughs policer of the neo-assyrian empire and judah becomes a part of the Syrian empire I become a vassal now and then from then on looked up until they go into captivity in Babylon a they keep flip flopping back and forth between the one now they're they're paying taxes and whatnot to Egypt and King nikka Federer Nico kills Josiah and now they're there they're flip flop back and forth through Syria and Babylon and and so at this point in time they're paying their like a vassal state to Babylon and they begin to the hip connacher and and so forth all the rulers begin to hear whisperings of revolt and they keep you know little revolts keep popping up and things so you know that's what eventually leads them to the Nebuchadnezzar just comes in and rolls over the place and just takes everybody day on the Hebrew children all the the prime people of the land takes them down into Babylon and and the 70 years of captivity stars let's start reading to check chapter 32 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah which was the 18th year of nebuchadnezzar but then the king of Babylon zarna the seat Jerusalem and Jeremiah the Prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was in the king of Judas house I this time Jeremiah is such a sad story such as sad from the natural eyes if you look at Jeremih he was constantly mistreated nobody listened to his prophecy and then at the end of a lot of his life he thought they did finally he gets to stay in the land after that everybody goes down into Babylon and the captain of Nebuchadnezzar army says you just stay here with the guy we're going to put in charge couple years later that guy gets assassinated and they take to your mind it's crap root down into Egypt and he's never heard from again so you know is that you look at you looked for with natural eyes are so many of God's people Isaiah that was Saul and a half and Paul that had his head chopped off it looks like their life and from the natural it looks like their lives just became to know but their life was totally killing over to God it was just everything they had to give it over to God he got what an example for us for them the king of bow was honored to see Jerusalem and Jeremiah the Prophet was shut up in the corner of the prison which was in the king of Judith's house this print prison was a little bit different maybe because it first falls in the King's house and you know he shut up but he can go in and out he can have people come to Yemen and talk to him and so he has a little bit of freedom I guess maybe a little bit like Paul I wasn't wrong or you could have people come to him and and sit with him and fellowship a little bit he was he was kind of shut up in a nice not not a thang a horrible prison but at this time later on that you know they throw him down that the whale and and do the other things to it for Zedekiah came jus had shut him up saying were formed us stop prophesied and say thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it as Eric I king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the convenience but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon that shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall behold his eyes and he shall leave Zedekiah to Babylon and there shall he be until I visit him say it the Lord though you fight with the cow because he shall not prosper Jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying behold had a meal the son of showing thine huncle shall come unto thee say by be my field that is an Anna thought for the right of redemption is dying to buy it so let's pause right there and go back to it when the children of Israel came out of Egypt they crossed the Jordan River and the aryan to the land of promise where Joshua began to appoint he divided begin to divide up the land this tribe is going to go here this tribe is going to go here and then further on down they divided it by loss they had a little process whereby to your take lots and whatever the lot fell on than that family would get that little piece of land so you know Joshua types the Holy Spirit so Joshua the Holy Spirit is given everybody their inheritance their possession and when you got that land you can look down on that land and maybe like in the old westerns and stuff they run your fingers to it this is my inheritance this is mine and my children are going to have part of this inheritance and you know take take that inheritance and I think a little bit spiritual it out for a second take your inheritance not just laying not land but it's a person your inheritance is the person of Jesus Christ and you have a part of that inheritance with him that you can look and see it that if you have that inheritance you know the way we are going to explain it he said you can look and you can say my children going to be part of this inheritance homo second if you can have that inheritance you know like they can look down on that land and say this is this is what God has promised from me go ahead and you can look at it you can look at God's Word to say everything that God has promised is mine I'm trying not to get bush so that land that land was special to them those it was it amid everything to them because it meant that they were part of God people it would part of his plan they were part of part of the whole a whole reason they wouldn't journey through wilderness and came out of Egypt everything was to get into that promised land to get to get into that to get into that was that was the finished work they complete her work and you know there's so many of those little stories like everyone Joshua were they what I always did if you go back and read through josho that was it uh and you might have heard these stories before that it was seven tribes I think they everybody else had gotten their land but they didn't so they they went through the land and they put they observe the land and they wrote it down in the seven-part book that sense for me and when they went back they you know that Joshua inheritance was given out and they they got their inheritance from what was written in that seven-part book but I think about this now one of those cities that was given out was an atop was this little city that's in dispute here that they had a meal at an owns this little fielding and look they can see that the Babylonian army at the gate an ax toss was maybe three miles outside of the cities of Jerusalem's it was right there they can the Babylonian army is there and hamel's he's looking around he you know this bad economic situation their economy is doing poorly and he's probably running low on funds and whatnot so he said I won't I i I'm going to lose my land I want to keep it in the family and the Babylonian army might come in and take it over and then right at the doorstep it's but I want to I want to keep my land now no no how did how did they lose their inheritance how did the we just can't talk through that they lost their inheritance they lost the right to him they lost the right to live on that plan and to stay there and got carried away in the captivity because they disobeyed God word how did how did we lose our right to how did Avenue bring forth the right to bring forth at that book the right to the what was originally written in God because they disobeyed God word one word off but you know you need that's why we need a redeemer somebody to come and take back what God has already given us and what was written in God before the foundation of the world so you think a little bit spiritual as well as a reading through this because from a natural I this story makes no sense it makes no sense for Jeremiah to want to buy the land when the Babylonian army was on the doorstep it made no economic sense I was listening to a little a little lesson that bill at all or even some he was speaking at a church and all the little kids were asking him questions and one of the things he said was as he was growing up brother Brandon would do things and say things and he would think that makes no sense at all and how in the world is that going to work out it makes no sense but you know God's ways are so far higher than I were like little puny ass to be able to even begin to comprehend him how can we comprehend God's infinite ways in his mind but you know what when God spoken and prophet said it and it's everything just begins to work out exactly the way they should maybe when you read some of these Old Testament stories it almost you can almost see the exact same thing kind of paint it out like as well as I've been kind of studying books Daniel seven weeks along brother late in my own private time you can see how that the world looks at day 30 weeks is like so many people call the Book of Daniel is like this big favor that's just written because because you know there's so many questions that aren't are difficult to solve if I just like looking at the natural timeline and whatnot gotta have a revelation what would we do without a prophet to come and tell us exactly the dates and exactly times an exact when everything went and exactly how everything's going to pan out so we do exactly what we know if we know god's mind it that it's so beautiful all right now let's get back on track in beholding hannah middle the son of showing uncle shall come into the same body my field that is an aunt atop the right of redemption is dying to buy it so Hannibal my uncle's son came to me in the corner of prison according to world over and said unto me by my field I prayed it as an inner thought which is in the country of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is dying and the redemption is died buy it for thyself then I need that this was the word of the Lord I think about tea by jeremih sitting there and he had a vision from the Lord this is going to happen and then it happened and you know we're walking in a vision right now because you can see the the things that were spoken of in Daniel the things that were spoken of and all all through Scripture are being fulfilled right now right now side and I take you out what I've been looking through day I'm saying the weeks it really does that you could give you chills and make you just to realize that our that we're living in and to see the things I just want encourage everybody to keep up to go back and brother way he's going through this and go back and reread it and reread it until it comes alive to you cuz Oh what will get in something here just said I know by my field I pray that as an inner thoughts which is in the country before arriving here just as down and redemption is dying by for thyself then I knew that this was the word of the Lord and i bought the field of hannah me on my uncle's son there was an inner thoughts and waiting the money even 17 she cools of silver and I subscribe the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and wagon the money in the balances now now that's Paul right there see how what great care in Jeremiah took to make sure that the debt was paid exactly there was nothing left out that the debt was paid that you could if you went back and looked at the evidence there would be no reason for anybody to say that there was a piece of the dead that was left unpaid it was totally paid then go over to a new testament look how Jesus standing on the on the on the banks of river Jordan easy telling John that we must I must fulfill all righteousness every job and every tittle has to be done so the debt is completely paid and program said to pay I was reading last night he said to pay the debt life had to be paying for death so Jesus on the cross back here there's that number again 17 17 she calls that we stayed on a while back so look at Jesus on the cross think extinguish spiritual eyes he's on the cross and he's he's doling out the price he's paying the price clinking and into the into the balance and you know go back in the Old Testament bill she's all that hand wrote on the wall your way to the balance and found wanting but here Jesus was paying all the price so that the whole price is made it out and pay there's nothing left and see what what care Jeremiah took the pay all the price and what care Jesus took because he came down God came down himself to hang on the cross and died and pay the price and put the illness the evidence was in an earthen vessel was it his own life don't come jumping over here that's what everything i bought the field a handwheel my uncle's son that was in inter Todd and waiting the money even 17 chicos of silver and I subscribe the evidence who wrote it all down and sealed it and took witnesses there Jesus hanging on the cross everybody could see what the prices we had been paid and weighed him the money and the balances so I took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open now let's pause for a second when you got up when you're purchasing the land where you got you know brother Brandon broken down into three different things there's a title and abstract and addie the title says you got on the right to this land the deed gives it to somebody so if I'm purchasing it from somebody this person gives me a deep and that says now that's the document that said the title has been transferred to you and the abstract is what you can go all the way back up again because what if somebody gives you a title and and but there's an issue with their like a couple of couple of owners ago some there was an issue with it that later they could come back maybe and say well oops you don't really own the land because of this this problem whatever so abstract traces it all the way back all the way back to and verifies that it's really yours there ain't nobody can come in and say oops found out there's a problem with it now now how did he explain that with a new birth with a new birth you can look in the Bible and say well I believe like you can read in the Bible all these promises of what not you can say well I've got it I've got it now well that's your title when you gotta have an abstract it traces it all the way back to eternal life now that's what that's what element that's the evidence that Jeremiah had to put in that earlier vessel not just the Hannibal on the land and he passed it up at Jeremiah but he had to write down all the way back to Joshua when Josh was doling out the land all the way back so you can trace it let's see what Burnham said I there I found quote ok I can find it I got so many quotes in the water second ah with this real feelings maybe i'll get to in a second when the Spirit of God comes upon you and you truly are one of God's attributes that he's spoken of now if you're not you're wondering flush straight and run here there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth if you are one of those that all things pass away right quick see and you become new and the plan of salvation is finished you're ready to obey every word of God they were that God ever spoken to you see for you to do your submissive to his word the contract exactly the abstract to the contract the title key belongs to you the debts are all paid it's all struck off and as it was at the day of Pentecost it's all the little doubts although the problems they might have been there if you've got the abstract or struck off because it goes all the way back to the original I hope I hope that's not born anybody sometimes I get when I do this little bobble straight for my family my wife says you putting the kids to sleep now now look at Revelation chapter 5 over and said now when Jeremiah wrote this book was sealed here's a good thing i want you to notice all of you to read it did that MC look now remember he was going to be gone he had prophesied now he didn't know it only who prophesy are you following me from prophecy new through the revelation of God that there was going to be away from that country for 70 years you remember him promise on that he would be 70 years they've been in captivity so he wanted to be sure that this seal that his inheritance will be kept because he had inherited his colors inheritance so he had it all rode up legally and what did he do with it so when rock a rust he put it in an earthly vessel and put it away so it wouldn't rot a rust until them 70 years was expired oh here here's that cordless phone praise Allah Revelation chapter 5 how many ever read it all right you ready ready then all right now he took and sealed it just exactly the way these Scrolls will seal here it's the most beautiful outstanding thing that you ever seen now I'm going to try to illustrate it with this piece of paper I don't know what I can here's the way it was written up like this now you've done it and you seal it like this he's down now what happened I want to each one of those seals rotor out of here his inheritance and what taking place and all the ones that fail before him and how young to inherit it was all sealed like that now that's that's a little natural story that he ever taken trace it all the way back to originally how he got it now Thank spiritually when you get the new birth the abstract titled eat it of the new birth experience in your soul can be traced back all but not traced back because it's not like there's previous owners and those different things like that but it's the proof that the original life is now that you're part of the original life and there's nothing in between my brother animals he said he's talking about he said just a few minutes ago I prayed for this little epileptic girl that had absolute epilepsy because in her natural genealogy her grandma she said he said he got it came from her grandparents so he said the abstract can wipe all that away because the abstract title deed gives you the right hmm it gives you the right to the land and then that the devil ain't got no hold on me the Devil cake come and say well what about this because the abstract can be traced all the way back to God's eternal life where you written in him before the foundation of the world and the way that God had to get that down to us was he had to put it in an earthen vessels so that it would last a long time it's gotta be in an earthen vessel so that it will last so first he came and put it in his earthen vessel I'm trying to line up here because of running out of time and then like Paul said in second Corinthians 47 we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us maybe you can take that much scripture and wreck it down so much look at that insulin say the power maybe Oh God go all the way back to when God began instituting this right of redemption and the land and whatever it what if what he told it always he said the laminating ain't even yours is mine and I'm letting you I'm letting you use it it's it's God working in us it's not us it's not us doing something but it's God being made manifest and so oh goodness I got two minutes I'm a rapper than just a second so I took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom in that which was open and I i just got a second time i'm gonna skip over that real quick but now look you can look at that you know program TV he was bringing their scripture out when he's talking about the seals when there's going to be sealed the seal means a finished work so he sealed up the illness so and put it in an earthen vessel so when you ask a long time when they came out of captivity they can read that oakland the open pieces say well this land belongs to jeremiah you can read this book and see well this this I got them I got the ride or whatever but there's got to be and something something something revealed to you something sealed a private piece this that there's an open and a private piece there's an open best visible to the world and a piece that's just visible to you reveal to you and your secret chamber this up there like like they all he got down and he began to read about Jeremiah said we're gonna be down first forget for 70 years and he got down on his knees and the angel Gabriel came and said well this ain't all us about it's not just about 70 years in captivity but i'm going to show you all the way up to the consummation and i'm going to tell you about God 64 purpose and about how that this evidence that sealed within this earthen vessels got to last all the way until 144,000 get the same message that the Gentiles do and I'll stop right there are two next year
