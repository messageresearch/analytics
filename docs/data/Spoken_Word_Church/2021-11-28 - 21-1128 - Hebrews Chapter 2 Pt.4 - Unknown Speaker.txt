========================================

god bless you this morning let's turn over in hebrews chapter two we got to verse nine i think last time let's just go to the lord in prayer real quick before we get into the word lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together and i pray lord that you just bless the reading of your word and open our understanding we ask in the name of the lord jesus amen so uh just just to real summarize briefly the the things that we read last time or the things that we're about to get into um paul was paul's lay in a foundation so that we can so that the hebrews that he was speaking to could have an understanding that that this man jesus that came and died for our sins made a way to deliver us from the fear of death and uh to take the stinger and uh the that take that stinger in himself so that we don't have to uh he hate that through death he might destroy them they have the power of death that is the devil and and uh what a profound statement that we don't have to fear death anymore so we will see what we as we as we kind of dive into that see what that means but let's just read through the uh the next few verses and just just so that we can set a background before we get into this and paul said in verse 9 but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should takes death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i am the children which god has given me for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham wherefore in all things that behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to sucker them he is able to sucker them that are tempted there's a lot to unpack you you think about maybe put yourself in the shoes of the people that were sitting there listening to paul back then and see each of these statements that he would make it initially or it would kind of almost be like wow what is he saying uh kind of kind of like how sometimes we are today when a minister says something that seems very strange but over time you begin to unpack those things and the spirit begins to reveal what each of those are are speaking about so let's just kind of dwell on each of these as we go through if we go to the next slide hebrews just to do a quick background the last time we were talking about this this little statement but we see jesus and paul in god's provided place of worship said but lord it does delight our hearts when we see jesus glorified among us when we see him glorified when we see his word which he is the word when we see we can read it here in the bible where he promised he would do it then see him work it right in us so when we see his word being revealed into uh in us and it begins to open up and then we see the effect of the word in our lives and the effect of the word in our church then we see jesus so we can be like that deacon that uh that little girl asked him do you do do you can you see god and he said i see god everywhere i look you you when you're when you're driving in your car on the way to work or driving sitting at home you you see jesus because the word is opening up to you and you can see the effect that it has in your life and and we'll go to the next the next slide we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man so tasting is really an experience tasting if we go to the next slide to taste it means to experience if you if you if you tasting uh some some kind of bitter fruit then you can tell somebody i know that that fruit is bitter that whatever that tastes some good lasagna or taste whatever it is you now you you have experienced it and you can share with somebody that i know what that's like because i've experienced it so when the bible says that he tasted death for every man he experienced what death is so now he can deliver you from death because he he experienced it psalm psalms 34 8 says oh taste and see that the lord is good so everywhere the bible uses the word the the the metaphor taste it's talking about experience taste and see that the lord is good how do you taste and see is that you actually experience it you come to church and you hear the word preached and and uh something begins to quicken a desire in your heart to get closer to god and you go through a journey like abraham did and all the things that the scripture talks about and then you can tell somebody about your experience god delivered me from my past god god redeemed me he he brought me from where i used to be to where i am now and you've got an experience that you can share with somebody else and first peter says as newborn babies think about how the phrasing of this desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow there by desire the milk if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious if you have tasted if you've experienced it then keep eating the word if you've experienced that god that if you've tasted so so if we go to the next slide but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death so he tasted death he experienced it for every man and this is a little statement just we could sit on for a little bit because the gospel is really for every man we can get it our in our mind pigeon hole to the idea that it's only just for a few people and and it's not oh it's it's actually an open book it's the door has been opened up so that anybody that wants it you know brother brown gave that example that he he god voted for you and the devil voted for you and now what it depends on is how you are going to cast your vote so we run through some scriptures real quick to kind of back that up in first john 2 and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world anybody that wants it can come the door is open and the scripture that we quote a lot john 3 16 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life the door is open to anybody that will believe and in revelation whosoever will let him take of the water freely and john 11 26 whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this whosoever so the door is open wide and on the next slide brother ramen and broken sisters he said and if you're thirsting this morning drink from it that's all you have to do god had provided a way for their thirst to thirsty children to partake freely of himself and god has provided a way for every man and woman this morning who was hungering and thirst so that's what paul's speaking of in hebrews chapter 2 verse 9 that he by the grace of god should taste death he experienced it for every man for anybody that wants it the next lie brother graham said in the queen of the south he said there's a pardon for every man that will hear and it's condemnation to those who does not hear it and he said in fellowship the stingers been pulled out of death for every man who will confess his sins and accept jesus christ's death in his dead for every man for anybody that will believe it the stingers pulled out now what what is the stinger let's go to the next the next slide brother said and when their eyes were open they knew him when he was preaching that sermon he said that's the reason god was made flesh in order to die that he could suffer and take the penalty upon himself he couldn't do it as long as he was jehovah and the spirit god the father and spirit could not do it but when god was made flesh and dwelt among us a human being then he could taste death and take the penalty they had put that he had put upon all human beings he took it upon himself and paid the price and we know we know the example that he gave that like a bee a bumble bee or a honey bee when it stings you it leaves the stinger in so he got stung so that you couldn't be stung but what's what's the stinger and i kind of want to dwell on that because we can see it looks like looks like there's a still a lot of stuff in the world it's just taking the sting out doesn't mean that you won't suffer anymore that you won't see somebody hooked up to a ventilator in the hospital with all the equipment beeping and that that's not what that means that there's not going to be hard times brother brown said and thus thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy he said oh that sting of death you watch it in a person's faith face i've held them in my arms and see them quiver and straighten out and quivering straight down and cry and scream for mercy nothing like a sting of death now he's talking about somebody that doesn't have some confidence at their death they're dying and and but the stinger hadn't been taken out there's they still got this the the stinger in there they're they're they're crying out for mercy they know that the situation hasn't been resolved there's the sin situation he said you know when the bee of death began to buzz around him you know if a bee an insect has got a stinger if you ever have if he have ever sting deep enough it pulls its stinger out it hasn't got no more stinger after that and when death anchors its stinger and the virgin born son of god he pull the stinger out of death it doesn't have any more stinger in it the only thing it is is a bluff so again what's paul talking about by the grace of god jesus tasted death for every man he got stung so the stingers pulled out so let's go to the next slide what is what what is that stinger and paul tells us what the stinger is in first corinthians chapter 15 o death where is thy sting o grave for where is thy victory the sting of death is sin the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law what's that mean the strength of sin is the law the strength of the the law is the remember the finger pointer so when you've done it wrong the law is there to point the finger but if you've got something to take the sin away if you ca if you can apply the righteousness of god to your sin then that's gonna that's gonna take the stinger away that's why paul said thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ so so you can see here i've got a little picture of what what takes what takes the sting away the sting of death is sin but if we can if the righteousness of christ can actually be applied to us like as illustrated in that drawing then that takes the sting of sin away his righteousness is applied so that's why he had to die on the cross so that when we believe on him he can give us back the holy ghost his own life and takes away the sting of death so then then now you've got confidence when you're when you're when you're faced with death when you're coming to the end of your road you know that the sting has been taken away like paul was when he put his head on that chopping block how could a man with confidence come to a place where he could just lay his head down and say chop away is because the sting had been taken away he knew that sin that the antidote for sin had been applied to his life and he wasn't coming there uh to that place uh crying and screaming for mercy and i'd like that illustration he just gave but he knew that the sting had been taken away now paul in hebrews chapter 2 verse 10 he said he said in bringing for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings so we've got a captain and and i got a little picture here of this captain one of the captains in that battle of san juan down in cuba and he was running he's running ahead of his men and see all of his men are looking at him as the uh he's the one that knows where we're supposed to go and brother said the brains of the army lays in as captains the intelligence so you follow he's our captain he's the one that led us into battle and if we'll follow him and he's making the illustration if we'll follow him instead of instead of the doctor instead of people that will tell us wrong he's the one he's the one he's our leader he said you follow your captain if he's the right kind of a general if he's the right kind if he's a four-star general if he's proved if he's been proven to be right follow him though it may seem wrong to you go on the front do as he told you now you well you think about how profound that is as paul is saying all these things that are kind of hard to be understood to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings each of these little statements seems like a lot to unpack and many times we don't understand but if we'll just do just just obey what the prophet of our day the the scripture says even when we don't understand it you think about the way that paul would lay things out is is very similar to to to how the experience of those early believers i believe was would would have been very similar to the way things kind of unfold today people back then there was a as paul would he would preach and there was a young man that fell asleep in the church and fell out of the balcony and he had to pray and pray and ask god to give him back his life people were falling asleep back then just as they are today things were hard to understand back then just as they are today people struggle with the sayings of paul just as they do today but he's saying we've got a captain if we'll follow our captain then he'll lead us into victory that's why on the next slide in the greatest battle ever fought he said oh look back here and say who is this great captain well i don't look back and see if it's dr so-and-so i see what the captain said you could you could kind of unfold that into a lot of different i don't look back and see maybe maybe even what your parents said maybe what grandma mama and granddaddy said your grandparents and their denominational system or whatever we look to see what our captain said what the word says he's our captain he said i see what the captain said he's the captain of our salvation what is salvation deliverance he's the captain of our deliverance so we've got a captain and brother braham said now and on the next slide he said to make paul as paul was saying to make the captain of the very salvation perfect through sufferings and and and and brother brown said the only way he could become the captain of our salvation he had to suffer so he went through a lot of thing that now the statement that brother brown was going to make is that he's our captain had to suffer and we're following him into battle so we got to suffer too that's kind of a hard thing to to swallow we don't like that but we life is hard a christian journey is not a flowery bed of roses it's full of of people rejecting your doctrine and people rejecting your your way and and like we were sitting around the other night fellowship and it seems like today it's gotten even worse than when i was a kid the way that people will look at our sisters and mock and scorn and i openly laugh at you and deride you as you walk by and you would go to the park and people will laugh at you because you've got a skirt on and things because you gotta you gotta suffer it's not supposed to be a flowery bed of ease and in luke chapter 9 verse 22 jesus said saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected he suffered and he really because he was rejected that's why they put him on the cross because he was rejected and isaiah 52 says many were standing at these his visage was mark his face was so marred more than any man and this is isaiah prophesied and his form more than the sons of men so he suffered brother said his face on that cross looked like like hamburger me like he had just been tore up so bad that he just was not even recognizable anymore and if we go to the next slide that paul and chad in chapter five of hebrews goes on to say though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and all them that obeyed him and brother brown when this mernian church age outlines that the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection because when you suffer you're being mold your character what happens when you suffer you go through a rough time and you begin to put your confidence in god instead of your own abilities something your character begins to be molded by your suffering in james chapter 1 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing and that's why god allows us to go through hard times so suffering where did jesus suffer if we go to the next slide one of the best examples of where his his character was molded by suffering was there in the garden of gethsemane as he said he his spirit was groaning within him and he was going through that battle do i stay alive and maybe have my own family maybe get married continue to live or do i die and do what god wanted me to do from the beginning so he said in luke chapter 22 he said he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done that's the effect that suffering will have in all of our lives that you begin to you begin to look for god's will in your life you want god's will and what is his will his will is his word you can find his will in his word not by some emotion or by like that you saw but looking into his word that you know so many times we think we think that we've got god's will because somebody has told us a story or something or something that they feel is the will of god and yet you're out of the will of god because you're not walking in the word the will of god is his word and he said and being in agony he prayed more earnestly that's it doesn't that sound familiar with maybe your own journey where you get to a point where you've gotten in agony and it made you pray more earnestly because you you're looking for god to come on the scene because of your suffering and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground brother brahman's burning in church age again he said unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation now if we go to the next slide perfected through sufferings so if jesus went through if he bore a cross and suffered then we he's our captain so we've got to come behind him and and go through our own sufferings which is why jesus said in luke 9 23 he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever shall lose his life will save his life will lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it and it's a it's a difficult journey the christian journey is and that's what matthew chapter 7 is talking about straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth into life and few there be that find it it's difficult in galatians chapter 2 verse 20 paul said i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god so that means it's his life in us and it's his faith in us doing the living now if we go to the next slide that's what paul's talking about on the next verse but both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one it's his life in us the one that's doing the sanctifying and the ones that are sanctified are all of one and and brother brown said don't you see the vine and the branch there all one so let's look at that parable that jesus taught about the vine the vine and the and the branches he said in john 15 he said i am the true vine and my father is the husband now you think about what he's saying there if he said i am the vine and you are the branches that means the light the life that is is living out in you is coming from a source it's coming it's coming from him and you're part of the same plant you're part of the same thing you're one with him the same life that was in him is living in you i am the vine and my father is the husband and every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh or what does that mean if you if you were to put a put a if you were to put seed in a womb and it didn't have a child you know something's wrong if you put seed in the ground and it doesn't come up and you don't have an apple tree or you have an apple tree and it doesn't bear forth fruit then what good is it i i planted a fruit tree in my backyard a while back and and it never bore more fruit so eventually i was like i i you know i need space for something else in my yard so i cleared it down and made you better use of that space if you don't bear forth fruit that's like somebody just this maybe you hear the word but you don't really believe it and it never bears forth so you've got to bear forth fruit that's why brother brown preached the sermon works works his faith expressed and is your life worthy of the gospel and the paradox and all those sermons about the life has to actually be manifested if you if you say that you believe but you actually don't bear forth fruits then then where is it on display he said every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which i've spoken unto you now see tie that in with what paul's saying here in verse 11 for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one so what makes you clean the one doing the cleaning and the one being clean are all one how are you one because he sanctified you by his word and when you receive his word he cleans you out that i think that's so difficult sometimes from to for us to grasp we think that we're going to be deliberate maybe when you're a baby christian you think that you're going to be delivered from that uh that that smoking or whatever your problem you're having you're dealing with that that vaping and things just by maybe just a a single outpouring of the holy ghost or just a feeling or motion but the word is what claims your life and you're sitting under the influence of the word being preached and the musicians should go ahead and come forward and we'll stop on that you're sitting under the influence of the word and it's taking effect on your life as you believe it and by and by it's driving out the unclean things and cleaning you out the word is what is sanctifying you and we'll stop on that god bless you [Applause]
