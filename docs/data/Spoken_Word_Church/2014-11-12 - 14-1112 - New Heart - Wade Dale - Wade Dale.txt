let's lift our hands your holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to sing amen they have eyes and can't see and ears they can't hear but there's somebody that's got a set of eyes they can see because Jesus said he said you know what he said the world will see me no more but you'll see me so you'll understand me so that's what we come to the house of the Lord to understand more about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ good to be in the house of the Lord you got your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Ezekiel chapter 11 and I know you heard all the announcements but just in case you didn't this Saturday is a fellowship meeting uh leaving around 12 o'clock uh December the 14th is the Christmas dinner and Thanksgiving dinner and watch not service brother William borlavon that'll start at eight o'clock and go to midnight looking forward to that had a good time with the ministers meeting everything we all got back with all of our feet and our toes and our in our head right brother Louise but we had a good time in the Lord we had a good time with the ministers and and uh I enjoyed speaking in front of them where they enjoyed it or not but uh I think we had a good time in the Lord so uh thank you for your prayers I know a lot of you have asked how it's went how it went it went rather well so also good to have brother Nathaniel Green with us he didn't know until just a few months ago that he was a signer of the Declaration of Independence he's a little bit younger than he used to be but brother Nathaniel Green good to have you with us buddy been a good friend for a long time founder of Greene County Georgia actually you're exactly correct one of the deer hunting capitals of the world so I wanted to take him he's going hunting with me and the reason he come down here but he's already caught one deer and her name's Caitlin and uh he is engaged to be married so I thought I'd take him hunting before he got the real ring in his nose so we are hope Caitlyn's not watching in tonight she'll probably kill me but no we really enjoy having brother Nate with us he's been a good friend his dad's brother Joe Greene for those of you that don't know up in Rutherfordton North Carolina been friends for a long time and Caitlyn's a good lady too so keep them in your prayer they're getting ready to start a new life not getting married soon but another year or so so just keep them in your prayers that they'll uh that they'll just love each other and Ezekiel 11 verse 19 we will start a thought tonight and I'd like to maybe continue it later on maybe in the first of the year but just keep me in your prayers also I am going to go to the Philippines sometime in February and stay two to three weeks so the Lord they've already set up several meetings several hundred meetings and that I can't get to all of them but um they've been wanting me to come for about three years so brother Dale said I could go and have the full back into the church so we sure appreciate that and like I said they've been wanting us to come for a long time so it's Ezekiel chapter 11 also keep June in your prayers she's watching in tonight uh her mother is uh is continuing to get better with the cellulitis but she's still having a little bit of problem with her memory and we know that the Lord can work all those things out but uh you know James June's uh it's a stressful time so just keep her in your prayers and also keep Zack in prayers I know I don't know if he told you not but this calf was he had a calf born calf and cow seems to be doing fine and uh so we will uh continue to pray we pray for animals around here too amen that's God's creatures that's that's the nature that's the nature of God I wish we had the nature of them sometimes amen we'd be a lot better off so Ezekiel verse 11 chapter 11 verse 19 let's pray before we get started Heavenly Father we pray Lord tonight that you would not be a bystander in this service but father be an active participant you be the one that does the speaking you'll be the one that does the hearing you be the one Lord that opens our understanding because without you lord it'll just be a Meeting of Minds that we will just give an intellectual speech and Lord it'll be over but father I pray that you'd Quicken your word through our Heart Lord we pray that you would just be the one with the ones that are sick and not with us Lord the ones that are sin sick Lord down below us below our feeders and names of many people on that wall that needs salvation Lord and we claim them all in the name of Jesus Christ we pray that you'll just be with our loved ones father bless the ones that are on the missionary Fields Lord give them fruit for their labor father bless this day and keep us safe Lord we ask these things in Jesus name amen Ezekiel 11 verse 19 and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I will take the Stony heart out of their flesh and we'll give them and heart of Flesh that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and I will be their god let's go to Ezekiel 36 and read this one real quick and then you may be seated Ezekiel 36 verse 26 a new heart also will I give you because he's content Ezekiel is continuing the thought a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will thou put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them you may be seated in the Lord has blessings reading the word you see that says and do them so we're looking tonight we want to speak for a moment on a new heart and I want to take it to the elementary part of justification sanctification of baptism in the Holy Ghost and if I get time we're going to continue on up in the pyramid I I told Brother Louise and and brother um Bob on the way uh back I spoke to a brother and and you know how we teach it here we you just don't don't through go through one stage of justification there's justification in the pyramid a man of sanctification in the pyramid all right then you've got the Holy Ghost up there in the pyramid well this brother comes up to me and he says he said I've been preaching teaching on the Statue of a perfect man he said you know there's justification in that pyramid amen how about fell over right because you don't hear that you hardly hear this down and you know what he said and it makes sense that's why you know people say well you shouldn't go to ministers meeting because you don't learn anything I learned something I learned I learned one thing he said brother Wayne he said I believe the statue of perfect man is the centerpiece of the message amen listen to that the centerpiece of the message you know you got this table and you've got a centerpiece that draws your attention to that table that centerpiece is the most beautiful part of that table before they put the food on the table all right so that statue of perfect man that was well put that's the center piece of this message and I believe that because it was taught back in the in the early ages Peter taught it James John all those back in the in the first church age had those virtues working in their life and and you know that's what people don't understand brother Branham didn't bring us the Statue of a perfect man just like brother Brown didn't bring us to a new way to be born again right right brother Brown didn't bring us a new way to dress brother Brown didn't bring us a new way to act right brother Brown didn't bring us a new way to come to church the first church age had all that amen amen they had these virtues working in their life amen Faith virtue knowledge temperature patience Godless brotherly kindness all the way up they had all those things they had one God Doctrine right they had serpent seed right they had how to dress right they had how to live right brother Brown did not come to bring us a new way to live right I like why brother Keith Reed said bro this message was given for Preparation to get out of here with amen it wasn't brought to bring us a new way to do anything sure it does change our mind it sets our mind in order for Holiness it brings us to a a higher form of justification and a higher form of sanctification but it doesn't bring us a new new birth when Jesus said you must be born again that's settled it forever with me and brother random never changed that you must be born again Nicodemus just believe and you got it yeah yeah and you'll be born just like me no that's not the way it is exactly we have to have a new birth brother Bynum come to bring us clarity Clarity make it clear of how to get back to that and to restore back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen but he did not bring us a new way to get born again and tonight because we're gonna and that was what we were speaking on this past weekend and I wanted to take it out of the Bible so we're going to take it out of the Bible and then bring the prophet's message in but right there in the Book of Ezekiel there are your three stages in Ezekiel 36 26. um we got young kids back there running them they're running the Enterprise tonight little Captain Kirk and little Spock back there put that scripture back up there you go buddy brother Josiah is running the camera and uh and uh Bob's son's running the running the quote so a new heart a new spirit and I'll put my spirit three stages right Ezekiel is showing how did Brother Branham get three stages he just come up with it no he took it out of the Bible the Bible gives you three stages a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you we're going to find out what that is that's not the Holy Spirit right amen that's not always bad and I will put my spirit within you that's the Holy Spirit okay so there's your three stages but let's look and drop back and let brother Branham explain some things so let's go to the first quote tonight and we'll see if we can bring it up it may be kind of Elementary but it's just something that didn't come up you know I I've had it on my heart for a while so and north at 1965 now this is after the seals broke all right and north at night 8 15 65. now now that the church that his very whole purpose was the church now how do we get into this church by one Spirit we'll all baptize into one body the church the body of Christ it cannot fail now here is what happens now watch this just a lick little figurative picture here brother Branham again shows his drawing of three rings you remember the three rings brother Ernie was was uh showing it last Sunday and uh and we see that the outer Court the inner court and holy holies now what he's doing here let me let me show what verse paragraph 122. now this outside man is the flesh that's what we look at what we see and it has five inlets to that body and any grammar school child as myself would know there's five senses control the body see taste feel smell and here without that you can't touch the body right that's the only way you have to the body see taste feel smell here you see it taste it feel it now that is the evil one on the outside all right now First Peter 1 23 shows exactly Peter says being born again not of corruptable seed okay so that's a dual meaning corruptable seed would be corruptable word but anyway you were born of corruptable seed from your mom and daddy right amen you we were all born in sin we there's none of us born right right if we did then we were born right the first time and we didn't need a new birth all right but we all need a new birth so that's the flesh born of corruptable seed but what we're trying to do is is we're trying to put on incorruption right working brother Louise from the inside out not from the outside in right all right we're trying to work from the inside out now inside of that is a spirit which you become where you're born in the earth and the Breath of Life is breathed into him that spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God now watch watch your profit though because all All Souls are given from God but watch what he says he says but it was parentheses given permitted right by God because Ezekiel even tells us you that All Souls are mine Satan can't give you a soul if Satan could give you a soul then Satan has seed then Satan is a Creator just like God is remember Satan's a perverter so anything God has God give it to us first right then Satan copies behind that okay he couldn't produce an able he couldn't produce a cane of his own self right so we had to borrow the seed from the Beast to inject himself into the human race all right so we're okay with that I know it's simple but we're going to try to get to the Statue of perfect man but I was telling him on the road sometimes we need to go back and review you know you don't always start trigonometry and algebra in calculus when you're in the 12th grade someday you may drop back to one plus one equal two so you know you need a little review so let's review this because I want us to see where we are because brother Brown said you can know where you are at with God at any moment all right any moment all right now inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born in the earth and the Breath of Life is breathed into him that spirit is of a worldly nature right because it what that's that the nature was not given to you by God the spirit the soul of man watch because it was not given from God it was permitted by God right all right so now remember if we stay there we're in trouble and I've got another quote that I'm not going to read but I read it to the to the brethren brother Brown says the reason you were given a soul we're reading a second part of it it's because to make a choice the animal can't make a choice because he doesn't have a soul you were given a soul to where you can change one way or the other all right and we'll get to that in a minute it's not faith and doubt right it's Faith or doubt one of the two all right they're both if Faith listen if faith and doubt is in your soul then you have to solve Satan give you one God give you one you go back to the two Soul Doctrine right which is not right because Satan can't give you us all right God gives you a soul Satan perverts your soul remember what I just said God gives you something Satan perverts it what you have to do is you have to change that thing by your free moral agency whether you want to stay a sinner or become a saint right all right your choice remember we were chosen in him not by him all right we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world if we were specifically chosen by him I was telling the Brethren you got to understand one thing if there ever was a just person in the world it has to be God because that's a white Throne judgment God is going to have to judge and he is a righteous judge the scripture says so if Adolf Hitler if he's standing there and Adolf Hitler in his spirit he looks up and sees me and he says you put something in him you didn't put in me how can God be just and judge Adolf Hitler if he put something in me different than he put an Adolf Hitler Paul says I contend all all born in sin all under the law until you talk to some people all don't mean all all means just other people but but remember God to be if you do no more than that to be a just God he's got to bring every person from Abel down to right now he has to bring him same way but then we're going to see in a minute that that's the same way we get back is through a three-step process and you can't get there any other way right amen you can't just you know I thought I told him I said we've come to the to the part to where we should be saying now like Paul did he walks in and he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you've been in this message have you received the Holy Ghost since you've been in this message or you just come into the message getting your thought get a new idea getting your spirit yeah yeah we need to be careful about these spirits and spiritual stuff you know Judas was spiritual Satan's the most spiritual person in the world besides Jesus Christ amen so we need to watch this being spiritual stuff we need to make sure that it rings right with everybody all of us with the spirits now inside of that is the spirit I already read it permitted by God now you got that for every child that's born in the world Listen is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies amen that right so that person inside there is a center to begin with now what special part do we have in that none we have representation we have representation that we come to it right all right so the person inside there is a center to begin with how clear is that is that okay is that clear enough you were a sinner when you were born in the world my soul was as black as nine but Darkness has taken flight amen so that person there is a sinner to begin with now it's got five inlets and then five inlets I don't know whether I can call them right now for now when the first I know is thought conscious love choice no conscious love reason there's five inlets to the spirit I'm not correcting brother Branham but you know what it is memory reason conscious affection imagination everybody got that all right memory reason conscious affection imagination all right now you're giving that to to contact the spirit part but that Spirit can either be one or the other because your memory can be good or your memory can be bad right your conscious can be good or your conscious can be bad amen all the way down your love is for your wife it's filial love not even close to agape love because Agape loves what comes to you and it's trying to work its way back out to where you can love God but now watch you're going to get a another Spirit though before you get the Holy Spirit right right seems like it's a little crowded in there yeah but it's not but remember the other day when we were speaking and I read you the quote and who is this Melchizedek brother Brown said every son of the faith is going to go through this journey sure so if Abraham went through justification sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost have met God in human flesh you're going to have to go through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and meet God in human flesh through a preacher now it's got five Outlets or and I told you what you were memory reason conscious affection imagination you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit right you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculty at all right your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit amen amen you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being because reason doesn't see taste feel smell or hear reason is what you can make in your mind right right the greatest battle ever fought Brother Gary I swear in the mind because Satan can come down through those memory reason conscious affection imagination that's his playground in that what don't you know what bothers you even as a Christian that bothers me my memory I can't I wish I could rate God can raise his but we can't erase ours all right reason is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or you're out your body is lying there dead but your spirit can still reason right all right there's five senses that control that Inside Man and now to the last man which is the soul there is only one sense that controls that so it's not faith and doubt right right that means there's two in there together it's Faith or doubt all right so that's what controls that is what now brother Raymond's calling this this your soul this is what it is and that is free moral agencies free will to choose or to reject right all right then we'll go back to Ezekiel 18 20 and 21. Watch What Happens here look watch the faith or doubt brother Brown had to get this from somewhere yeah he had to get out of the Bible he was a word Prophet God cutting down come could not come and just give him a revelation and he take it and go with it remember he said I'd spend all day in the scripture see it was a word prophet he had to go back and put it in the word he may have never read Ezekiel 18 but that's where he got it from right all right watch because it's the soul that sinneth it shall die now if we stop right there we have no hopes we Have No Way Out right the Bible says the soul that sinneth is dies the sun shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son what what Ezekiel is showing us through the word is that I don't have to give an account for my son he don't have to give an account for me if his sin if his soul sins he's going to die if my soul sins I'm gonna die but I am not connected with him as far as our soul remember we're a free moral agent okay and you know what I like that that gives me a free choice the sun shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him look verse 21. I like that word but here's our way out but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed now wait a minute the soul of sin shall die but if the wicked will turn from all the sins that he has committed what does way with Seed doctrine has done it seedlines if you were born from Cain you're dead if you're born from Abel you're alive now if you're born from Mom and Daddy you're dead right period I don't care who you are Prophet king or whoever right there's only one person born of a woman that was born right that was Jesus Christ but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed and keep all my statues and do that which is lawful and right he's turned something around here he's went from Death To Life and to do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die faith or doubt right right can't have both in the soul right right everybody understand that can't have that in the soul you can't have faith and doubt right right I like that you like I like that that gives us a way out that gives us that all the soul of sins and she'll die but if the wicked and that was us if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statues and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die I like that don't you so I'm gonna let's go into the future home just for a minute and uh and read a couple of quotes because to me I was telling the um the Brethren you know there is a there's a Doctrine in the message that brother Brown changed the way to get the new birth after the seals broke right Aaron's heard it I've heard it I've heard it preached a bunch of baloney you know why because watch this this is 1964 after the seals broke we have to do this in The Minister's meeting you have to just you act like they're all babies most are 1964-0802 future home now I told him I said if I had if if they came to me and said look we're going to lock you up in prison for 10 years and you get one message book I take that message book right there because it gives me it shows me justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost it shows me what's going to happen in the Millennium and it shows me what I'm going to my future home right I'll take that book right there one book now if they give me a series I take the seals but one Buck I take that book right there because look notice how God makes it plain to us and if that wasn't a great confirmation a good a great loving blessing from God now listen to this Prophet this is 1964. after he changed the way to get the new birth so man says that sense of boy first time ever Christ dealt with me I've still always taught those three stages of Grace that where'd he change being changed right if he did your life of course now they're saying he's lying yeah so forget that notice if it isn't true now right all right then let's go to paragraph 87. now the first step now watch brother Brown now what he's doing is excuse me we have remember we go before the world does right the world goes through three stages justification Saints against baptism the Holy Ghost but it does not go before us because listen we fell first then the Earth fell after we fell so now whatever found first has got to come back to Power before the Earth can come back for the people to live on so that's what he's explaining in the future home he's explaining the three stages of Grace as as it will happen to the world because remember when we were in organized religion in the Baptist Church they say well the Bible says the Heaven and Earth will pass away so what their pretense is and most people in denominations see that this world is going to be blown away and we're going to go to heaven now thank God we got a prophet that looked up the word pass away it means changed right right are burnt off not annihilated so the Earth's not going to be annihilated look this Earth was created in Isaiah 44 or 45 I believe says this Earth was created to be inhabited now that's the Eternal Word of God so this world with this Earth will be inhabited by his people but now he can't listen here's my point if God can't come to this earth if his feet can't touch this Earth before it goes through those three stages God's not going to dwell in your soul right right without going through those three stages amen now the first step is repentance toward God and then follows after that is water baptism that word repent is something we're losing in the end time we try to get them to the water no get them to repent right if they truly repent the baptism will be sure because watch what he says repent and be baptized the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism follows follows showing that repentance was genuine all right excuse me are to remit our past sins that has nothing to do with future sins all right so this is just a simple part of justification and sanctification but we gotta go through it or to remit our past sins that has nothing to do with future sin that's what you call saved right that's what you call saved I've been saved I repented of my sins God was just to forgive me of my sins I was saved now if I die right then I'm going to go to heaven but I won't be bragged right is that all right I won't be bribed because I don't have because we're going to read this in a minute your sin's been chopped off but the thing that made you do it still in there so God can't be in there all right so you got to repent be baptized excuse me or to remit our past sins that has nothing new with future sin it only remains in other words you repent tonight God's just to forgive you your sins if it's a true repentance you go outside get in the car and get killed you're going to heaven all right the Bible says in John 3 16. for God so loved the word he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life all right there's going to a lot of people be in heaven that didn't have the Holy Ghost down here right now amen but they were God was just to forgive them of their sins he knew that their repentance was genuine but now if you continue on months down the road you're going to continue to go back do the same sin you were doing so maybe your repentance wasn't genuine we'll see as you go through our as we'll go through our life it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what for remission taking away a past sin has nothing to do with the future right right just your sin has been chopped off what you did right right you can't repent for one item done you never done it Adam did you just get forgiveness for what you've done the old nature is still there exactly all right same way with justification of the earth remember what happens when the earth justified in the days of Noah God chopped off right the world's past sins only eight Souls were saved but what came across in the ark ham just as soon as man come right down on the Earth again and started multiplying they went right back to sinning the same way they did before all right you can't repent for what Adam done you've never done it Adam did it you just get forgiveness for what you've done the old nature is still there all right in Ezekiel 36 26 let's go back a new heart also will I give you all right and a new spirit will output within you because we're coming down to here a new heart will I give you all right justification sure he'll get it's an accent those who he's Justified he's already glorified amen if you're truly Justified truly you'll go on to the glorification all right so a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh because your flesh is going to start acting with what's inside amen amen and I will give you a heart of Flesh right let's go back to the future home now then secondly oh we got the first part down right I'm sure then secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right remember you've been cleaned and we're going to read it right here in Matthew you've been clean but nothing's come into to replace that right all right because that's what happened excuse me when Jesus when he dripped his blood on the earth and Sanctified the Earth remember all of our bodies were in the Earth but now remember that didn't do away with sin at that moment as soon as Jesus was ascended they just kept right on sinning right right until they come to the day of Pentecost and 120 Upper Room got the Holy Ghost and others got the Holy Ghost but here we are in sanctification when the unclean Spirit Matthew 12 43 when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man unclean Spirit goes out because remember he says I'm gonna give you a new spirit then he saith I will walk through Dry places seeking rest and findeth none so the unclean Spirit the the smoking the drinking the the running around the all the things of the world that unclean Spirit should go out of you at sanctification okay all right then he saith I will return into my house from whence I came out see he's even claiming it's still his house yeah I didn't see that just a little while ago who is that that unclean Spirit saying I'm going back to my house because remember he dwelled there for a long time he did with me and he said I will return into my house so there's got to be a change it's not faith and doubt it's got to be Faith or doubt right from whence I came out and when he has come he financed it empty swept remember what sanctification cleaned and set aside for service all right empty swept and garnished right right you go to church you do all the things you're supposed to do then go with he and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation right all right you know as well as I do how many times have I preached here in this church sanctification is the best and the worst position you can be in hey man do I need to explain that maybe some of you knew ones I need to explain it but if that unclean Spirit goes out he's not going to bring seven more of his drinking buddies with him right right he's going to go straight to Satan and say look I need some religious Devils right right we need to make this guy religious right right we need to make him religious we don't need to make him eight times more drunk no he thinks he's okay we're going to bring him into church and set him down and we're going to feel him full of something and it ain't the Holy Spirit right it's a spirit all right cotton got it everybody okay with that all right so far then now this is the header here should be the future home it's not there I didn't put it there it's not their fault it's mine right here should be the future home paragraph 92 then the next comes the baptism of Fire of the fire and holy ghost that God might dwell in Us Now where's he at before he's not dwelling in us right one is with god brother Bram said the disciples could not understand Jesus because God wasn't in them yet right that's just too simple to understand yeah I want to stop here for a minute and and make a point and I I'm not going to call any names but one brother he took three cups one brother took two cups and they were explaining how God was in your soul and Satan gave you a a nature on that soul and then I ain't got enough cups and then something else happened right here and the guy got all this piled up and then when God comes he takes away this and he takes away this and you realize that this always was there I like that cup because it's black God ain't black ain't got nothing new with black you understand what I'm saying now what did Brother Branham use brother Branham used one cup we're talking about not talking about communion either he used one cup it's too simple they sit there and it looked like one of them things has got the shell game with the shells underneath it you know where they're moving stuff around and moving this around no you know what brother Branham say God reaches down and picks up a cup right it's dirty right good anyway because you know you watch them guys they start stacking stuff on top of each other and moving stuff around and you're like just use one right just one brother Brown said God picks up that glass dare he to drink out of it because it's dirty right but he has he has picked it up because he wants to use it for something he cleans it out sanctification he cleans it out and then he puts it in service right one cup amen amen not three or four and all these you know stacking on top of each other that's okay because you do have a nature that's attached to you it's an adamic Human Nature and it's sinful but your soul is not exchanged right right I I one of the brothers there at the meeting he didn't uh he didn't know what brother Brown meant now this brother's been in the message 40 years and he didn't know what brother meant brother random meant by the you know brother Brown said he doesn't believe in the pre-existence of Soul or transmigration souls he said the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence well if you'll go to your Eagle views there's a little box there you can punch that box and it brings the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of Souls and it'll explain it to you gives you about three or four pages how that we all were Souls individuals in heaven before the world I had two Mormon uh secretaries so I know I asked them I grilled them every day about stuff but we were all up there and Jesus had a way for us to be saved and Satan had a way for us to be saved we were all to come down here and Jesus said well not everybody's going to be saved not everyone's going to want to be saved so I'm only going to save the ones that I can save Satan stands up and says well I can save them all every one of them I can save them all well supposedly God the Father stands up and says we're not going to use your plan Satan now this is true you read it I'm well Satan we're not going to use your plan because everybody can't be saved we're going to use my son Jesus's plan that's the way it is I mean that's the Mormon doctor and then we come down here to take on human flesh well Satan comes down here with his Fallen Angels can't get into flesh but he's trying to press us he's trying to press into our flesh so that's the doctrine of pre-existence or so brother Brian said I don't believe that he said what were you what were we brother Brandon before we were born he said you were nothing only in the mind of God you were nothing you weren't a spot you weren't a place you weren't a person you weren't a soul floating around that's what he said we were nothing except in the mind of God all right but still I you know I just I like to use one cut one cup to me works just great I don't have to do no explaining it was just I was I was unclean and now I'm clean all right and and I accepted the salvation of God and he saved my soul okay and that's why I told him I said and I'll use brother Louise for an example he said man when I first come to church here he said I I couldn't understand what brother they were saying you know had a hard time you know he said but now he said if you follow him a little while you can understand what he's saying well that's exactly the way it is with anybody really I mean you you can preach a simple Doctrine or a simple you know um like tonight and pretty much everybody will get it and it's a social gospel but but we don't preach social gospels here we try to get a little meat involved a man but if you listen and don't do like them guys and listen to refute then you might learn something and um and and learn something every Sunday I wouldn't come church if I didn't learn something some of you must get enough in one service I still got scripture for that you can stay gone all you want to but I got I got scripture for that you must not believe the day is approaching then the next comes the baptism of the fire and holy ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin now watch heart heart's not this thing heart is your inner being your soul that's the inside guy all right so it cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside right because it wasn't there to start with if it was you wouldn't need it then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us all right so now let's compare it with Ezekiel 36 27 rolled up bro Zach and I will put my spirit within you all right now we're going to read this in a little bit where brother Brown breaks this down but this is your third stage I will put my spirit because it's not your spirit made over right right it's the holy spirit amen all right we don't believe in an exchange of the soul but we believe in the change a change right because it was dead scripture says the woman is dead while she liveth weren't you married first time right we were all married to Satan between Satan and Eve right we were all married between we're all we all had a first husband that had to die if not you can't marry again or you're an adulterer and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues now buddy that's a radical it caused you to do something and you shall keep my judgments and do them all right future home keep going now he takes the place where we are to dwell in through the same process now he's called The Church through justification called it through sanctification right I don't want to stop here for a minute and then filled it with the Holy Ghost and Fire we must know that we went through a stage of justification right right exactly right where God forgive us of our past sins you know why or we still have them right right we have to go through a definite period of sanctification it may last two years two months or two minutes right amen and I believe I can tell you where I went through them because you're the only one that goes through it all right brother Dale can't stand up here and say well you went bro mark back four five years ago you went through he can't do that right amen it's an individual affair with God it's between you and him and then you thank God for the justification you thank God for the sanctification I can walk you right through it through Abraham's Journey right into my journey and that's what it said brother Brown said every son of the faith has to take this journey so listen if I go from here to California that's my journey and with my eyes I can see that Journey I see all the states I went through all the troubles all the trials to get there but you can't go through that and explain it like I can because you weren't there right right same way with your experience called it through sanctification then filled it with the Holy Ghost in Fire and he took it through a process now how are you going to say you know or just believe the message the devil believes the message better some of us and he took it through a process because remember folks Judas was justified in Sanctified that's right had part of the ministry exactly look how close then he himself that he himself the Holy Ghost himself the Son of God could dwell in the human heart now it has to go through that before this is the future home 1964. after the seals broke supposedly Brethren changed away a new birth it has to go through that before he can come into it what your heart right right amen notice he done the world where that bride is going to live the same way his same Plan of Salvation right so the earth goes through justification in Noah sanctification when Jesus dripped his blood cleansed and claimed the Earth amen then it's waiting it's got to come on us first it's waiting to get his fiery baptism for God to come and dwell on the Earth the literal Earth he's got to come into this Earth First all right now go to the next one we're going to go to this is number three this is where brother Brown is going to explain the Book of Ezekiel this is 1956 hitting the Life of Christ Minneapolis Minnesota now the Bible said that he would give us a new heart right right and he would give us a new spirit and many people even Pentecostal people and Full Gospel people has been deceived in that many times God said I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't his Spirit right it's your spirit then I'll put my spirit in you I'll give you a new spirit then I will put my spirit in you and many times you get the new spirit and think you've got the Holy Spirit right and trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life doesn't pivy up to that now that's just a little raw but remember it's the truth paragraph e47 many people that's why brother Brown said you can't wait till the door if you got the Holy Ghost you can't wait till the doors the church opens up now what's the difference in that does your life pivot up to that are you just Sanctified and think you got the Holy Ghost we make excuses people but one day the door is going to be shut and you're gonna be left out exactly you're going to have that Spirit but it ain't gonna be the Holy Spirit right and you're going to go through the tribulation many people that spirit that new spirit God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his Spirit right well some people so mean they can't even get along with themselves Mark was that way he come to a journey like I did that's all I can pick on him let alone with God if he'd come in if he'd come in that's right so doubtful and up and down God has to give you a new spirit give you a new nature so you can get along with his Spirit when it comes right amen I hope you see it God gives you a new spirit for yourself amen and then puts his holy spirit in there Amen to dwell with you and abide with you everybody okay with that amen let's go to number 457 113 what does it take to make a Christian Life now I want you to listen for a few minutes before closing I want you to notice one thing and watch closely now watch the order of the scripture I will take away the Stony heart and give you a new heart now the heart is the dwelling place of the holy spirit amen and I will give you a new spirit I want you to watch the order right now many people get mixed up there they think they get the Holy Ghost but they just get a new spirit right brother Brown says your name goes on the book at sanctification as a Believer as a church goer right right so that ought to mean when you start going to churches when you're sanctified quiet I like it they think they get the Holy Ghost but they just get a new spirit watch I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit and then I will put my spirit now the new spirit God had to give you a new spirit but that's a new spirit God give you so you could get along with the Holy Ghost with that old Spirit you had you couldn't get along with your neighbor right right you couldn't get along with yourself right so you know you so you know you couldn't get along with God but look you know what we laugh about that but you know God's so gracious he does that for us in stages because he knows we can't take the Holy Spirit at first amen he knows us as humans we can't take the holy spirit all at one time right right A lot of people go crazy doing that right but he gives it at stages he gives us he softens you know he takes the Stony heart out because hey we had all had a Stony heart so he takes the Stony heart out and then he gives us a heart of Flesh and he gives us a new spirit so that we can get along with your neighbor you can't even get along with yourself so you know you couldn't get along with God so God gives you a new spirit and many times under enthusiasm if you watch the life then it Bears I hope I'm not hurting but I hope I'm uncovering right see a lot of times you think you have the Holy Spirit oh you say I sung I spoke in tongues certainly being that close to it you might do all of that but that isn't the holy spirit yet right see the Holy Spirit Bears record of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the word amen amen so you'll do what the word says now he taken and what does he do give you a new heart give you a new spirit then puts his Spirit his spirit in you it's just like you don't have to go around and pretend you're a Christian man that new spirit brings new life amen the holy spirit in your new spirit in your new heart right right same person Gloria same Cup right right it's not three different cups right in one cup we just took one cup took it through three stages okay your new heart your new spirit and the Holy Spirit goes right in the center your your heart your new spirit and the Holy Spirit goes right into the center of your new spirit right and your new spirit goes right into the center of your new heart right right it's like the mainspring of a famous watch and it's self-winding all right it sits right in the middle of that new spirit the mainspring of a famous watch sits in the middle of the watch and makes every organ of that watch every instrument just perfectly at a time it's all done by main spring in the little works out on the side move with this mainspring it's the wheel in the middle of the wheel as Ezekiel say it amen amen you get a new spirit then he puts his spirit in now let's look and see just for a few minutes at the Statue of a perfect man because we all know and and some that are watching in may not but there is a teaching in the in the message that you have to receive all these virtues before you get the holy spirit because you see that Holy Spirit right there well now let's go you can look it up brother that but let's go to Second Peter just for a moment I wasn't going to read it but I feel led to read it so let's go to Second Peter chapter one if they can pull it up that's fine if not I'm gonna let the Bible explain this because watch Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained now was Peter born again was Peter Born Again Peter had the divine nature of God Peter was born again this is 80 66 30 something years after the Holy Ghost fell into that Pentecost and Peter was the spokesman right so Peter's got the Holy Ghost amen amen Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained light precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his Divine now is Satan divine there ain't nothing Divine about that dude right nothing nothing Divine don't even describe him what does divine describe God amen Jesus Christ Divine does not even describe you but if you give the divine nature of God right right it describes you Grace and peace be multiplying you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness that's what I told him downstairs when we start with a statue of perfect man this is going to talk to you about life and how to be like God right not just be godliness right here life life how to live life and how to be Godly and live in that life right all of a Sunday School classes shaking their head because they've heard it 67 times 67 sermons or sermonettes downstairs we are just on the Holy Spirit and brother Louise said we I thought we started last year February of 2013 I'm slow people sorry do slow according has this divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue so it has to be through the knowledge of Jesus Christ amen whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these the prophet said these promises you might be putakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust right divine nature not your nature right right his nature and besides this right right so it's separate are you reading scripture with me amen and beside this in other words beside this so this is a new birth correct and besides this all right giving all diligence add to your faith verse reverse your knowledge so you're born again at Faith baby form Faith you receive the spirit of adoption Romans 8 whereby we cry have by father you don't receive adoption because you're still a baby you're still crying crying daddy daddy that's what it says and that's right here that puts you in the body that makes you a son amen okay then you start living these things that these virtues out then God chops off your past sins right right exactly we sin every day right Christians sin every day so down here is not Christian amen if Christians sin every day we're up here doing the sinning is that all right we're up here doing the Senate right right so we have to be forgiven that's why we say God forgive us of our sins and God is what just to forgive us right right all right he's not he's not stopped forgiving us our sins because we have sins only Christians have sins all right sinner doesn't matter this doesn't matter to a sinner you take this and give it to a sinner and they just like well so what you know I mean what does that mean to them but to us like the brother says it should be the centerpiece of our life Glory the centerpiece you can't understand the seals without these virtues operating in your life right actually these virtues were working in Peter James John and Paul and they didn't understand the seals right amen so that's kind of what I'm telling I've been telling them downstairs that's what I said brother Brown didn't come to bring us any of this this has been 2 000 years amen amen not belittling brother Branham greatest man says Jesus Christ but he did not come to change this or bring us this a new doctrine as far as that's concerned amen this is the years of preparation coming to the prophet's message which is that right there amen amen amen that's the prophet's message 1963 when the seals broke there is a message of the son of man right because if that if you could take that picture and put it right there there's Jesus's head amen he's the head of the church the body but if we're not working right in the body we either are not in the body or we got cracks yeah that's why brother Brown Put Holy Spirit right here right because it seals this together brother Brown says weld the only way you can weld something is have two pieces right you can't wear one piece of anything right you gotta have two pieces God and you right you gotta have two pieces weld it together right right so add to your faith add to your new birth virtue knowledge temper space is Godless brother kindness that Holy Spirit right here we've been talking about is the thing brother Brown said that seals it all together amen it seals you in as not just a believer in Christ but it makes you to where God can work through you better than he can down here right right because you know what I was born 54 years ago into the Dale family all right I was a son but now I didn't realize I was a son and what Authority or not Authority are a responsibility or not responsibility until I reached a certain age right and you know what dad and mom didn't when I was six years old they didn't say you need to be driving son maybe a bicycle but not a car why they knew my maturity level hadn't come to a place where I could drive the car yet I had all the faculties as I was using Brother Bob for an example the other day in in Mobile that's where you you come into the line of adoption you receive the spirit of adoption whereby you cry Daddy Daddy but you are in the line of adoption but you don't reach adoption till you come to maturity right let's go through all these drop down to verse 8. because watch what this is going to do now remember don't read it yet remember when you were born again God give you what new heart spirit and his Spirit right a process okay he put us through a process of of giving us a soft heart giving us a new spirit unclean Spirit goes out God gives us a spirit that we can contend with him and truly become religious because we start coming to church we start doing things right we start trying to do the things of God and then God comes in and bursts us into the body as a baby now as a baby dad named it at three years old they didn't set me up and give me a T-bone steak how much more heavenly father knows exactly what we need at each stage that we're still going to make mistakes but once we get a little bit closer to the top someone asked uh down in the Sunday school class about is this heading to sinless Perfection no there's no such thing as sinless perfection only in God because he's the only sin in this one okay but we are heading to a place to where as Brother Gary like like we talk about the flu see Satan can still come in this way through memory reason conscious affection imagination he can still pack those flus full of stuff whirly stuff what God's doing I I uh what do you call that Donnie when you you backflow when you went around you know you backflow like a radiator Flows In One Direction and it flows through these coils and every once in a while those coils get stopped up with junk so you reverse the process and you backflow which means you take the water and send it back this way to blow out all the stuff that's all right right that makes your radiator run better because it runs in one cycle one time all the time like this and when those flus get stopped up you just take reverse the process well all the flus are getting stopped up with Satan coming in this way but God's on the inside doing a backflow he's but you know what which one wins which one wins which one wins Chief which one wins the one I feed the most but I like this Peter gives us a summation this very positive right right for if big word right there very small word but it's huge because that's the choice if means a choice right all right for if these things be in you and just be there abound means to overflow if these things be in you and abound they make so you can read that like this for if these things being bound they make you that you shall need to be buried or unfruitful that sounds good but I like to read it like this for if these things be in you out of bound they make you right that right there literally makes you do something right with all these with all these things in you it may it changes your your thought process all these are are thought processes hmm look all these are thought you got to think about having a temper before you have one yeah you show I'm quick tempered you can stop it so you thought of it first right right all these are thought processes especially that one right thought processes these virtues for if these things being you and abound they make you right right that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen but now here is your other but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall right pretty positive in it if you do these things you shall never fall new heart you spirit and my spirit new heart new spirit my spirit that's not your he says add to your faith sure but that's the faith of God amen this is the virtue of God not just the virtue of a man this is the knowledge of God the temperature of God the patience of God the godliness of God the brother the countenance of God and brother Bram said love which is God all right amen so this holy spirit is there to to mold this together and give it that last make to me that say when you're born again it does make you do different obviously you should but you still have problems you're a baby you make mistakes sure we all did that but growing up in God those mistakes should get less and less or we got to work on that more and more you know brother Branham what do you do if you got to stand your spirit all your fasting praying and ask God for us he said just give money away do the vice versa look that word up that means do the opposite brother Branham I'm stingy give money away I don't do do the opposite he said boy that's pretty powerful you'd think you'd go through a whole you know find scripture for that he said no just if you don't have patience start trying to have a little bit of patience but you know what you can't get it on your own you can't get it on your own right God has got to give you that patience above your daily patience some of us have patience some people have patience some people don't have patience but that's Godly patience if you'll read the statue of a perfect man I love what that brother said and I see it more now as the centerpiece because without the statue of perfect man see you most people say well I'm going to go through uh the new birth and then oh I'm just going to be adopted and God's gonna just pour this down on top of me and he's gonna pour it down on top of you all right and I'm gonna you know just I was telling them coming up the road uh Saturday most people in this message two things they think God's got a date on the calendar and that's when he's coming brother Brown said it was the Readiness of the Bride sure God knows what day that is but he ain't got it circled on a calendar as I'm coming back on this day right here but he knows what day it is when me and you get ready amen and he's waiting on us brother I'm still waiting on you and I adoption time when God can pour in his fullness but if we don't come to adoption you can forget I mean if we don't come to these virtues working first then God adopts us into the family and then we go to the headstone we've missed the centerpiece the piece of the puzzle brother Bynum said God had a plan and a purpose this is his plan and purpose from birth to adoption as I got older I knew what my position was in the Dale family I didn't know it was always there I was a son always the son but I had to come to a place to realize that the Dale family was more than just being born in the family it was things that you had to uphold and things you had to do and think same with you you understand that's natural what about more with God when you were a baby baby form you know God let you make mistakes when you get up to there he's not going to let you make mistakes right if you do he's going to whip you for it all right because you're supposed to be maturing you know they didn't whip me for not driving a car at three years old but they would probably whip me at 54 for not being able to drive a car don't say yeah because you could do it be quiet but God listen the way we're raised is the way God raises us or we couldn't understand it new spirit I mean new heart new spirit my spirit then you start your walk and you do the same thing going up the statue of a perfect man till you get there to love and that's the Capstone of everything is love you love the Lord God told us through brother Branham he said Watch and Pray and that's what we should be doing we should be watching let's stand and pray new heart new spirit in my spirit amen he gives us the word of God as we need it he doesn't give it to us before and I'll promise you one thing he knows whether you can handle it or not so he's not going to give it to you you know he told them one time he said don't cast your Pearls Before Swine we'll see God doesn't either God doesn't give you godliness knowing that you still have free moral agency and you're not as Godly as you should be do you understand what I'm saying he lets you go through a process the prophet said so all these are a process that we go through from birth to adoption let's sing a song 280 in the Red Bull 280 in the red book Let's sing and worship amen draw me near Lord you have a need Lord is here to give you your needs to what in which book 280 read book I'm drawing Red Book s for what you're doing and you and God the only person that knows that the blessings lost all right nice friend with friends you're all we need nearer blessing Lord to the cross and vibrations that Outreach till I rest in peace with the drawing us till thy precious bleeding signs before I forget brother Dale's gonna go for a stress test tomorrow so let's pray for that but I want to you know you remember the other night when he was talking about how he was we were both hunting together and he was up in the camper you know and couldn't breathe well I told him I said you were doing that for me because I ain't been telling anybody but I've had chest pains and couldn't breathe for about a month um almost passed out several times and uh after that day it was lifted I guess you just had to get both of us in the camper together so but you know what you can pray for this man you know what he Bears your burden any bears your sin too he does and he intercedes he was interceding for me and didn't know it right seeing he was it was for Brother Gary too obviously but I was laying there and and you know when we went hunting that what a couple weeks ago and and you know heart was hurting pressure pain um dizzy couldn't breathe yeah but I didn't say anything about it I just you know I try to pray my way through it like a lot of us saw you know we try to do brother Dale's taught us that because because truly and I don't mind you coming up here and being prayed for it but brother Brown says you get weaker every time you come to the altar you got to believe best thing to do is just take that thing and say look I'm standing on it right here right here I'm standing right here sure come up one time maybe for prayer to get the wheel started right but but it's like one of the quotes you know it's up and we sure we have up and down days sure we're human but it but if you come up here for prayer for for for a condition of whatever your heart don't come up here for that again it's your faith is what's going to do it your faith right now see I wasn't laying there praying that Daddy would take on my my condition I was praying for God to get it off of me but he was praying remember he called everybody's name so he called the right name he called my name God connected to that and took that thing away from me and it's not bothered me since so you know you you have confidence in God when he was saying that the reason I didn't testify I wanted to tell him in private you know that night because he was he was obviously had a problem but now the last time we were down there he didn't we were everything was fine see that thing had left it that thing had come up off of me and got on him so he had to pray it off of him to get it off to get it off of him but he's got a stress test tomorrow so just pray that uh that uh there'll be no stress Why They Call Her stress tests I guess because it's got all this stress involved you know but you know take the Lord at his word amen thank the Lord at his word say God you said that if I took these virtues and put them in my heart that you'd make me you would literally make me do things that I'd never done before and when they abound they overflow you remember the you remember the dream sister Shepard's dream the water was coming up out and over overflowing right and you know what he said made that box stick honey and honey represented brotherly kindness that's what I told him downstairs that is one of the that is why that's where it's at because without brotherly kindness the love of God's not coming right you gotta have love for the brother before he can bring that love down to you amen Even in our inadequacies and our wrongs and our in our you know little quirks that we have God still wants us to be to where he can speak to us and he's give us an Avenue away I am the way the truth and the life and he gives us Shepherds to stand at the door not to block the door except to let the knock let the devil in but it keeps you from roaming around I've roamed around before I'm yeah I'm honest and the shepherd had that's why I like them Shepherd hooks they can reach out there and they can grab that thing he grabs you by the neck most of the time and draws you right back in so you know you know what God will not lose one son he'll not lose one if you're a Son of God he'll put you through hell and high water but if you're a Son of God and you're supposed to come to that right there if you're supposed to come to love and your body get changed without dying you gonna be a bruised felon or sister from all that but you know what though he said he would do it with tender hands that's right because they're a nail scarred we got to go right back people to our Salvation right right you can't get away from the Salvation that God give you right if you get away from that and think you're just something because you're in this messenger listen let me tell you something I told the brethren I understood the major doctrines when I was 14 years old exactly exactly right I was lost I didn't have a Holy Ghost I understood all the money it is just the ability to read to understand the major doctrines as long as long as you get a little bit from Brother Branham you can read in the word and you can put that thing together and not even have the Holy Ghost if Judas was part of the ministry he must have done something without the Holy Ghost cast out Devils spoke in tongues but the life didn't pivot right as brother Branham said to life this thing that's why you see these people that are going through and dropping off they're going through they've went through 30 40 years and dropping off why they never had he never put my spirit right it was some of their own Spirit but it wasn't the holy spirit that went down into that soul and cleaned that man out because remember that's your typos and if that type post is either Faith or doubt somewhere down the line that Doubt's going to pop up right amen where there's a preaching of the word or whatever there's something's going to reveal that or make that manifest it's gonna just like just like God's Gonna Make You with these virtues he's going to make you that spirit inside of you if it's of doubt it's going to make you go toward doubt every time then there's nothing we can do about it except we just preached the gospel and just think that everybody's safe that's what you got to do you got to think everybody's safe but we preach the gospel not trying to hurt you but but trying to help you right it's like brother Dale says it's your soul that we're worried about it's that Faith or doubt we're working in not the memory reason because you can sit there and you can reason and have memory and conscious affection you can love brother Val you can love your pastor or whoever you can love these people with regular love but is it agape love is it the love of God right or is it just that you love him because he's a nice guy and he don't get on to you all the time that's why you don't like me because I get on to you all the time but that's okay I can take that as long as I see your soul saved I really don't care whether you like me or not on this side but you will over there right and I won't say I told you so over there I promise I won't I will not say I told you so never you know that's one thing God won't do he'll never ask you why it took you so long to get saved right that's one question he'll never ask you he'll say enter into the joy of the Lord Glory made for you from the foundation of the world he's not going to he's not going to berate you Nate for a hundred years why didn't you get saved knowing you exactly he knew exactly today the exact moment and he says enter into the joy of the Lord I'm not worried about how long it took what about that woman it was 90 something years old brother Brown met her across the curtain of time she was a young woman now boy you talking about something to be shouting about she was 90 years old that angel said she was saved in your meeting now he never had contact with that woman as far as physical contact because he didn't he didn't see me if he saw her she was 90 something years old now she wasn't but he said she was saved in your meeting and she said oh my precious brother one meeting she got the new birth one mate and she got the new birth and it changed that woman from an old woman to a young woman power God glory man can't do it Satan can't do it I told him I said we have down here on Earth we've we've tried to change things and we can't change nothing we're still dying right sure what makes you live 10 years longer big deal right you only got about 75 or 80 years anyway that's a drop in a bucket but we trust in God we trust in God more and more to do what he said he would already do not what he's going to do but what he's already done yeah man let's buy our heads the heavenly father we pray Lord that she would take these things that we've said and let us do as Mary and Ponder him in our Heart Lord let him become alive in us Lord may we sometimes reach back into the old books and pull out a little justification and sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost and and show that it's not just when we started our journey as continue to be with us all the way through that we trust in your justification your sanctification your spirit Lord is in our heart not just a new spirit not just some of my old one patched up but a new one just like you create a new Heaven and a new Earth you're not going to annihilate this Earth and you're not going to annihilate your people Lord you're just going to change with fire in the Holy Ghost father you're the only one that can change us from Mortal to immortality we can't do it on our own but father you've give this give us the provisions to do it with father I pray that you'll be with each one as they go on their separate ways be with brother Dale tomorrow is the stress test will produce prove that everything's fine and you'll be with brother Nate and myself as we go hunting for a few days Lord that you'd be with us to keep us safe give us game for your honor and Glory father just bless each one that's here the ones Lord that are not here that's watching on the internet father we ask you to just strengthen each one Lord just bless us tonight and take care of us lead us by your Holy Spirit till we come back together in you on Sunday father that will be renewed in spirit ready to listen father for we ask in Jesus name amen you're dismissed Within Me created and renew right Spirit Within Me
