[13:28] a brand new man
[13:32] and praise the Lord Jesus amen he
[13:36] redeemed me by the grace of the Lord and
[13:39] we've been born again to do something to
[13:41] win amen and we're more than conquerors
[13:44] if we just continue to hold on to that
[13:46] unchanging hand by the grace of Lord and
[13:49] to pray for one another lifting one
[13:51] another up
[13:52] I believe we live in such a time of this
[13:54] independent spirit that you just are we
[13:57] hardly pray from one another the way we
[13:58] should and that's so important I was
[14:00] reading a story not too long ago about
[14:02] this this man he went to a brother's
[14:04] house and his teenager son picked up the
[14:06] phone and was very rude he was on one
[14:09] line and that was when the phones were
[14:10] attached to the walls and his father's
[14:15] friend picked up the phone and the young
[14:17] man was on the phone he was like who was
[14:18] on the phone get off the phone I'm on
[14:19] the phone
[14:20] was just very rude and that man left and
[14:23] he'd called the dad later on he said oh
[14:25] my heart was broken when I heard your
[14:28] son acting like that and I've been up in
[14:30] the mountains praying and fasting and
[14:33] God gave me the victory and that man was
[14:36] changed that young man was changed and
[14:38] he was sharing his testimony back then
[14:40] and that's how I was so important to
[14:42] pray for one another certainly the young
[14:43] people they certainly need our prayers
[14:45] during this time I mean it's a very
[14:47] dangerous dangerous dangerous time in
[14:49] the enemy he's at war and it almost
[14:52] feels like nothing's wrong
[14:54] which is wrong it feels like nothing's
[14:56] or they're fine they're gonna be okay no
[14:59] we have to pray for one another the
[15:01] Satan is doing everything he can amen
[15:04] and not just for the young ones but for
[15:05] all of us it's no doubt it's a battle
[15:08] amen well let's get ready for the word
[15:10] let's stand you excited amen well let's
[15:14] sing with all of our heart our brother
[15:15] get ready open the eyes of my heart
[15:21] hope in the eyes of my heart
[15:27] open the eyes of my heart
[15:31] I want to see
[15:34] I want to see
[15:43] open the eyes of my
[15:45] [Music]
[15:48] open the eyes my heart I want to see
[15:56] I want to see
[16:01] to see you high and lifted
[16:07] [Music]
[16:09] shining in the
[16:11] [Applause]
[16:11] [Music]
[16:19] holy
[16:24] hi
[16:29] shining in the light under Maury
[16:34] pour out your power and
[16:37] as we say
[16:39] [Music]
[16:47] only warning
[16:50] [Music]
[16:52] holy holy holy Lord they've lent you
[17:07] want to see him you've you've heard the
[17:10] song song now just turn around and say
[17:12] god bless you to somebody and you'll
[17:14] find him right there good to be in the
[17:18] house of the Lord
[17:19] couldn't have all of you here got a good
[17:22] crowd even when half the crowds gone so
[17:26] remember to pray for brother Dale and
[17:28] Anna they're on their way up too and
[17:31] they're actually going to Vanderbilt
[17:33] University there where brother Dale is
[17:35] and and that's where brother Dale our
[17:39] brother Dale should be up there where he
[17:41] can pray for him and and give him give
[17:44] the family some comfort we're still
[17:46] human beings we still got things that we
[17:48] go through that we we need help with so
[17:51] we pray the Lord will bless them
[17:53] tomorrow whatever they have to go
[17:55] through if there's any left Thomas just
[17:58] give them back the tea and let him I got
[18:01] I ran those off so we don't have to do
[18:03] the chart and you can write your own
[18:04] notes or whatever on it and and keep
[18:08] them with you because we're going to be
[18:09] studying now on the six fold purpose I
[18:12] doubt we're going to get two but maybe
[18:14] one of them today so just give everybody
[18:18] one that should be about 50 of them so I
[18:20] mean little kids probably doesn't need
[18:22] one but unless they want to color on it
[18:25] or draw on it Michael
[18:30] Wow they grow up don't they
[18:33] man they grow up but good to be here
[18:36] like said remember the brothers coming
[18:38] back from North Carolina they had a real
[18:39] good time talk to them yesterday
[18:41] they're having some really good
[18:42] fellowship brother Bob and brother Lewis
[18:45] and brother Zack and brother Joe and
[18:49] brother Anderson and their family or are
[18:52] coming back from North Carolina I think
[18:54] as we speak so just keep them many
[18:56] prayers I also put on your calendar
[18:58] October 26 that will be our church fall
[19:02] annual Fall Festival down it guilty
[19:04] park we got to get all the arrangements
[19:07] done for that but it'll be we'll have
[19:10] hot dogs and all that stuff and little
[19:13] things to do for the kids so that will
[19:14] be October 26th coming up man it's
[19:18] almost an October grief he said he'd
[19:22] make a short work of it which I'm glad
[19:23] he is I don't want this thing to drag
[19:25] out no longer Linda then then then it
[19:28] really is so I wanted to get out of here
[19:30] so um and that's what we're gonna try to
[19:33] do so today if you mind turn your Bibles
[19:35] or I gave you all the copy I didn't know
[19:37] but the brothers in the back I told them
[19:39] a streak young men sitting back then if
[19:42] you add all three of their ages up they
[19:44] probably not even gotten to my age yet
[19:46] so but they've got huge amounts of
[19:48] experience and they're gonna try to put
[19:50] the stuff on the board but if they don't
[19:51] get it all up there then you've got it
[19:53] you should have most of it all therefore
[19:55] you can read it so we're going to go
[19:58] into the six fold purpose this brother
[19:59] Dale was saying this morning we we need
[20:02] to understand dang of seventy weeks
[20:03] maybe there's still people that have
[20:11] different ideas but like I told you
[20:13] before we got to go by what the Bible
[20:16] says because brother Branham did not
[20:18] change the Bible he cannot change the
[20:22] Bible faced final resting place we'll
[20:25] read it in a few minutes if some of
[20:26] y'all ready to read through the quotes I
[20:27] found two of them where brother Branham
[20:28] said face final resting place is in the
[20:31] Word of God
[20:32] so whatever the prophet of God said and
[20:34] whatever any preacher says has to
[20:36] connect back to the Bible can't be
[20:40] contrary or change it because the Bible
[20:42] is unchanging at least we can put our
[20:44] faith in that that the Bible is
[20:46] unchanging amen and then you know the
[20:50] prophet of God told us he told us to
[20:52] look into the Bible and see ourself so
[20:55] as we look at this today we're going to
[20:57] look part of the six fold purpose but we
[21:00] must see our Redemption first so look at
[21:03] this is the plan of redemption for the
[21:05] children of Israel but it's also an
[21:09] allegory are a has an underlying meaning
[21:13] for the Gentile church because the six
[21:16] seals finishes Redemption there's no
[21:18] Redemption in the Seventh Seal that's
[21:20] Christ there six sales finishes
[21:23] Redemption and then the Seventh Seal is
[21:25] Christ himself which we've been talking
[21:26] brother Dale has been talking about
[21:27] which would be the headstone but not
[21:30] Christ coming back here in a corporal
[21:32] body he does not come here in a corporal
[21:34] body until if you look on your chart
[21:36] where it says thousand year millennial
[21:37] reign Christ is not coming back until
[21:40] then it's in a body form so what body
[21:42] does you have you and I where his body
[21:46] where his movement where his actions
[21:48] that's why that's faith virtue knowledge
[21:50] temperance place in college brotherly
[21:51] kindness that's the action of the body
[21:54] of Christ here on earth alright and
[21:57] Israel has fell from that we've been
[21:59] discussing that Israel fell from being
[22:02] bride but they didn't fall so far that
[22:04] God is not gonna redeem them back and
[22:06] bring them in their service because he
[22:08] said he would never ever forget Israel
[22:11] so we can't forget Israel and then so if
[22:14] you turn to Daniel 9 verse 21 I know we
[22:18] all have needs if you lift your hand I
[22:20] know there there's a lot of things on
[22:22] our heart today of healings and
[22:26] salvation and I don't know I'm gonna I'm
[22:30] gonna give you a little a little hint if
[22:32] you write here under this pulpit about
[22:36] right here under down in my Sunday
[22:38] School class is a board full of names
[22:42] some of your names are on there
[22:45] your family's names are on there your
[22:47] husband's wife sisters brothers my all
[22:49] family got all on that that board right
[22:51] there I want to start taking those off I
[22:54] won't start taking those off because
[22:58] that's for that's for salvation that
[23:01] whole thing I want to take them off I
[23:03] want to see them here I don't want to
[23:05] see a picture in here I want to see them
[23:07] here in the building
[23:07] amen I want to see them here we all have
[23:09] them down there so it's all connected to
[23:11] every one of us so as we pray let's
[23:14] remember those that are right here we
[23:17] pray over them and we preach over them
[23:19] every Sunday and every Wednesday so
[23:20] let's just start claiming the ground is
[23:23] as the Israel has a land Israel has a
[23:26] land to claim and a city to claim so do
[23:30] we have a land to claim this land
[23:32] this land you claim your kids came from
[23:35] this land my kids can't my kids came out
[23:37] of this land and then so we're gonna
[23:40] pray that God will bring them in
[23:42] amen because we all have them down there
[23:45] so we're all connected to it so let's
[23:46] bow our heads
[23:47] you have any father thank you for this
[23:49] day that you give us we pray number one
[23:52] that you would be the active participant
[23:54] in the service Lord you'd be the one
[23:56] that does the speaking you'd be the one
[23:57] that does the revealing because without
[23:59] you here Lord it truly is just a meeting
[24:01] of minds
[24:02] father we pray Lord that you'll beaver
[24:04] brothers a land animal as they travel on
[24:05] highways that you'll clear all the
[24:07] traffic back let them give them a good
[24:10] safe trip and when they get up there to
[24:11] to be with the family they're the
[24:13] Robert's family Lord that all would be
[24:14] well that you'll grant them Lord the
[24:18] petition that we all pray that brother
[24:19] Roberts will come out of that thing and
[24:21] be made whole because you're you're the
[24:24] God that can do that we call them the
[24:26] Great Physician not one that's up there
[24:28] we have good doctors on the earth but
[24:29] there's a great physician and that's you
[24:32] Lord I prayed that you'd come on the
[24:34] scene and be there with them and let us
[24:37] have a good report father each one Lord
[24:39] brother Sterling's sitting back there in
[24:41] the in the foyer back there with with a
[24:44] headache and and with his ears ringing a
[24:47] little bit because of the noise and
[24:49] because of the rape but father we pray
[24:51] that you would intervene in that
[24:53] situation right now Lord that you'll
[24:55] touch him father
[24:56] we asked your blessings on each one Lord
[24:58] we all had needs uplifted hands Lord
[25:01] heal the sick save the Lost
[25:03] give us a revelation more than anything
[25:05] because we are supernatural people that
[25:09] need revelation to feed off of Lord to
[25:11] make it through this dark and dreary
[25:13] world father just be with us now and
[25:15] take care of us in Jesus name we pray
[25:18] amen
[25:19] Daniel 921 yeah while I was speaking in
[25:22] prayer even the man Gabriel who might
[25:24] seen in the vision at the beginning
[25:25] being caused to fly swiftly touched me
[25:28] about the time of the evening oblation
[25:31] something about that evening time and he
[25:33] informed me and talked to me and said Oh
[25:35] Daniel I am now come forth to give the
[25:37] skill and understanding now he didn't
[25:39] come to give him confusion and
[25:41] misunderstanding
[25:45] he come to give him skill and
[25:47] understanding but the part we're have
[25:49] problem we're having with is when we
[25:51] start reading this and most of the
[25:52] people the message is confusion and
[25:54] misunderstanding God's not a master of
[25:57] confusion Satan is a master of confusion
[26:00] so if you're confused it's not God you
[26:02] men at the beginning of that
[26:06] supplications the commandment came forth
[26:08] and I am come to show thee for thou art
[26:09] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[26:12] matter and consider the vision seventy
[26:15] weeks are determined upon by people who
[26:18] is that Israel or the Jews and upon thy
[26:21] holy city keep those two things in mind
[26:23] the city is what Jerusalem to do six
[26:26] things and that's what we're going to
[26:27] talk about something today when we get
[26:28] to it to finish the transgression to
[26:32] make an end of sins to make
[26:34] reconciliation for iniquity to bring in
[26:36] everlasting righteousness to seal up the
[26:38] vision and prophecy and to anoint the
[26:40] most holy
[26:41] know therefore and understand that from
[26:43] the going forth of the commandment to
[26:45] restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the
[26:46] Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks
[26:48] and threescore and two weeks and the
[26:51] street shall be built again in the wall
[26:53] even in troublous times and after
[26:55] threescore and two weeks shall Messiah
[26:57] be cut off but not for himself and the
[27:00] people of the prince that shall come
[27:01] shall destroy the city in the sanctuary
[27:03] and the end thereof shall be with the
[27:05] flood and to the end of the war
[27:06] desolations are determined and he shall
[27:10] confirm the covenant with many for one
[27:11] week and in the midst of the week he
[27:13] shall cause the sacrifice and oblation
[27:15] to cease and for the overspreading of
[27:17] abominations he shall make it desolate
[27:19] even until the consummation and that
[27:22] determined shall be poured out upon the
[27:25] desolate you may be seated in the Lord
[27:27] at his blessing to the reading of the
[27:29] word so Daniel asked Lord what are we
[27:34] gonna do we're only gonna be in here two
[27:35] more years what are we going to do how
[27:39] are we going to act or what are we gonna
[27:41] do when we get out of this 70 years in
[27:44] captivity the prophet of God said he
[27:46] thought so much God thought so much of
[27:48] Daniel he just told him all the way to
[27:49] the consummation now what is the
[27:51] consummation to Israel the consummation
[27:55] if you look on your chart the concept
[27:57] the consummation of Israel
[27:59] is to get into that 1000 year millennial
[28:02] reign because that is to them not to us
[28:06] everybody got that same am and it is
[28:09] still in time time does not break and
[28:13] quit and leaves time is still going on
[28:16] for that 1000 years until we get to the
[28:20] white throne of judgments everybody got
[28:22] that same am alright you're gonna say a
[28:25] man long enough you won't go to sleep
[28:26] a man a man okay alright so something is
[28:31] going to happen Israel is going to be
[28:34] restored and the city inside that 70
[28:41] weeks of Daniel it's not gonna go up
[28:44] brother Branstad it won't miss it one
[28:45] way either way it's got a starting time
[28:47] in this kind of stopping time everybody
[28:49] got that and then so if you'll just hang
[28:52] on to your chart make you some notes if
[28:54] you want to but I'll show you where that
[28:56] applies to because we're going to jump
[28:58] forward then we're gonna have to jump
[29:00] backwards but we won't jump backwards
[29:02] today we're going to review a little bit
[29:05] and then we're going to start into the
[29:06] six fold purpose because remember the
[29:09] six fold purpose happens during that
[29:12] 1260 days that the two prophets are
[29:17] preaching to Israel and also that is
[29:21] going to be in the middle of your week
[29:23] there you see the 1260 days then there's
[29:25] 1260 more days they okay with that but
[29:30] see most people in the message if you
[29:31] look at me real good real look at me
[29:33] around here this is what most people in
[29:35] the message see there's only 1260 days
[29:39] left after the rapture there is only
[29:40] 1260 days of preaching but the Bible
[29:44] says he shall confirm the covenant with
[29:46] many for one week okay and we'll explain
[29:49] why that that is that way and you say
[29:52] well I got these quotes the Bible is
[29:57] right face final resting places in the
[30:01] Word of God I don't care what prophet
[30:04] priest our King whatever they say if
[30:05] it's country to the word they're wrong
[30:07] now brother Brown made some statements
[30:09] that you say in your mind now well it
[30:11] sounds like he was wrong he was
[30:12] wrong we're wrong we did not understand
[30:15] what he was talking about because he
[30:17] can't change the Bible one more time he
[30:19] cannot change the Bible he shall confirm
[30:23] the covenant with many for one week
[30:24] who's he the Antichrist do we see that
[30:26] government made no so whatever quotes
[30:31] you God it's got to match the Bible I
[30:33] can't stand it when man starts drawing
[30:36] their own charts and making their own
[30:37] predictions and all these things that
[30:39] are seemingly to fulfill their own
[30:45] agenda I've only got one agenda is to
[30:48] make sure that you understand the Bible
[30:51] the Bible and that is clear what day an
[30:57] hour that we're living in and what God
[30:58] is doing at the present time all right
[31:01] so let's go back here and Jeremiah
[31:04] you've got some of you've got you're
[31:05] already got your sheet out oh they'll
[31:07] pull them up Josiah doing a good job
[31:09] putting that thing together but it let's
[31:12] back up and see because remember the
[31:14] first thing we were speaking on was the
[31:16] history because the history will tell us
[31:19] why they went into captivity now you
[31:21] know one thing's for sure it there's
[31:24] dual meaning in Scripture so if Israel
[31:27] fell because of something then you and I
[31:31] did too because redemptions not
[31:34] replacement it's bringing back that's
[31:35] what fell and we fell all right and
[31:37] we'll see how that connects today in
[31:40] bringing in that wild olive tree now
[31:43] Jeremiah three verse fourteen sister no
[31:46] backsliding children saith the Lord for
[31:48] I am married unto you remember Israel
[31:50] was God's first bride and they went
[31:55] whoring not physically but spiritually
[31:57] they went after other gods and all the
[32:00] things that God told them to do they
[32:02] didn't sound like somebody familiar
[32:04] sounds like me and you alright he said
[32:09] that I am married unto you and I will
[32:11] take you one of the city and two of a
[32:12] family and I will bring your design and
[32:14] I will give you pastors according to my
[32:15] heart which shall feed you with
[32:17] knowledge and understanding God sent
[32:20] them prophet after prophet after prophet
[32:22] after prophet after prophet one more
[32:25] time after
[32:26] profit and what they do they kill the
[32:28] very messenger that God sent them turn
[32:32] them down
[32:33] poor little Isaiah a young man they cut
[32:35] him in pieces killed him at a young age
[32:38] because of what why because he was
[32:40] prophesying against Israel telling them
[32:42] what they were gonna do Jeremiah 3 verse
[32:45] 20 says surely has a white as a wife
[32:47] treacherously departed from her husband
[32:49] so have you dealt treacherously with
[32:51] meal house of Israel saith the Lord now
[32:54] voice was heard upon the high places
[32:56] weeping and supplication of the children
[32:58] of Israel for they have perverted their
[33:01] way and have forgotten the Lord their
[33:02] God return you backsliding children and
[33:05] I will heal your backsliding see what
[33:07] God is doing he's giving them all the
[33:10] grace in time to come in but what did
[33:12] they do they turned it down and he had
[33:14] to give them a writing or a bill of
[33:17] divorcement divorcing her because she
[33:20] went after other gods she went and
[33:22] committed spiritual fornication and as
[33:25] we read in Jeremiah where Jeremiah says
[33:28] the land was polluted you can't take if
[33:30] your wife goes out and commits adultery
[33:32] you're not supposed to take her back
[33:33] because the land is polluted so his wife
[33:35] went out committed adultery he gave her
[33:37] a writing of divorcement but he couldn't
[33:39] forget Israel because he said I couldn't
[33:41] he said I can't forget Israel so he's
[33:43] not going to just totally dump her and
[33:45] leave her alone but here they are gonna
[33:48] have to go through some hardship here in
[33:50] Jeremiah watch Jeremiah 25 verse 4
[33:53] through 12 and the Lord had sent unto
[33:55] you all his servants the prophets rising
[33:58] early and sending them but she have not
[33:59] hearkened nor inclines your ear to hear
[34:02] they said turn you again now every one
[34:05] from his evil way and from the evil of
[34:07] your doings and dwell in the land that
[34:09] the Lord hath given unto you and to your
[34:11] father's for ever and ever
[34:13] and go not after other gods to serve
[34:15] them into worship then provoke me not to
[34:17] anger with the works of your hands and I
[34:19] will do you no hurt he's trying to get
[34:22] him to come back same way with you and I
[34:25] he's trying to get us to come back but
[34:27] you know what we didn't hear we didn't
[34:28] hearken I like brother Branham so honest
[34:31] of a prophet he said God tried to save
[34:33] him at 12 years old remember that and he
[34:35] said I turned it now what a what a just
[34:39] he said no he was a yeah he was a
[34:41] prophet but he wasn't born again not at
[34:44] 12 years old he had to go through the
[34:45] same process we did amen
[34:48] yet you have not hearkened unto me saith
[34:50] the Lord that you might provoke me to
[34:52] anger with the works of your hands to
[34:54] your own hurt therefore thus saith the
[34:56] Lord of Hosts because you have not heard
[34:58] my words behold I will send and take all
[35:01] the families of the north's at the Lord
[35:03] and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
[35:04] my servant and will bring them against
[35:07] this land and against the inhabitants
[35:09] their own and against all these nations
[35:10] round about and will utterly destroy
[35:13] them and make them an astonishment and a
[35:15] hissing and perpetual desolation
[35:18] moreover I will take from them the voice
[35:20] of mirth the voice of the voice of
[35:23] gladness the voice of the bridegroom and
[35:25] the voice of the bride the sound of the
[35:26] Millstone and the light of the candle
[35:27] and this whole land shall be a
[35:30] desolation and an astonishment in these
[35:32] nations shall serve the king of Babel in
[35:34] 70 years and it shall come to pass when
[35:37] 70 years accomplish that I will punish
[35:39] the king of Babylon and that nations
[35:41] that the Lord for their iniquity of the
[35:43] land of the chaldeans then we'll make it
[35:44] a perpetual desolation now we know that
[35:48] happened when the 70 years was over that
[35:51] they were that came back to the homeland
[35:53] but will not get into that today but
[35:55] remember the 70 weeks of Daniel finishes
[36:02] up just like what he says though because
[36:04] there's going to be a battle of
[36:05] Armageddon God's going to destroy the
[36:07] whole all kingdoms of the earth will be
[36:09] destroyed because Israel has come to
[36:12] that 1260 days 144,000 has been saved
[36:15] filled with the Holy Ghost and have been
[36:18] taken in a rapture and then God's going
[36:19] to pour out the wrath of God upon the
[36:22] nation's that has what they hate listen
[36:26] every nation in the world except maybe
[36:28] America hates Israel they want that
[36:31] little place going they stuck a thorn in
[36:33] their side but you know what God's not
[36:36] going to forget that and he's not gonna
[36:38] forget that land either because that's
[36:40] where we're gonna live he thought enough
[36:42] of that he's gonna take his not his
[36:43] bride his Gentile bride we're going over
[36:45] there to live amen
[36:48] never what we read not too long ago
[36:50] where the prophet of God said right
[36:52] same spot that Abraham took communion
[36:55] with Melchizedek it's for the city's
[36:58] gonna push up what a profit that knows
[37:01] exactly where that's gonna happen at but
[37:04] thank God we had a profit they could
[37:06] tell us these things so second
[37:08] chronicles 36 17 through 21 therefore
[37:11] now this is chronicles talking about
[37:14] Israel this is telling of how Israel is
[37:16] going to be destroyed
[37:20] therefore he brought upon them the king
[37:22] of the child Diaz who sleet slew their
[37:24] young men with the sword in the house of
[37:26] their sanctuary and had no compassion
[37:28] upon young men are made an old man or
[37:30] him that stooped for age he gave them
[37:32] all into his hand and all the vessels of
[37:35] the house of God great and small the
[37:36] treasures of the house of the Lord and
[37:38] the treasures of the King and of his
[37:40] princes now remember Solomon has built
[37:42] this great temple he's built put gold
[37:46] and silver on everything and it was the
[37:50] glory days of Israel everything was
[37:53] wonderful but then what happened was
[37:54] every time God would send a prophet they
[37:56] would get worse because they wouldn't
[37:58] listen to that prophet they would get
[37:59] worse and they would get worse and they
[38:01] will get worse so God told him said I've
[38:03] had enough the grace of my arm has just
[38:07] don't that long okay same way with you
[38:10] and I he come to me in 1997 brother
[38:12] Donnie and he said my arms that long
[38:14] you're at the end of it same way with
[38:18] all of us he come to a time and he said
[38:20] hey that's enough you've run I've let
[38:23] you do whatever you want to do you can
[38:24] do whatever you want to do during life
[38:26] but listen I'm knocking today and you
[38:29] responded thank God
[38:31] we responded the right way because some
[38:34] will not because he has to come to
[38:36] everybody but he did the same thing with
[38:37] Israel he said I'm done I'm finished all
[38:40] the vessels go to the house of God great
[38:41] and small of the treasures of the house
[38:43] of the Lord and the treasures of the
[38:44] King and of his Prince all these he
[38:46] brought to Babylon and they burnt the
[38:48] house of God and break down the wall of
[38:50] Jerusalem see you've got to remember
[38:52] this Israel and the city so they break
[38:55] down the walls of Jerusalem and burnt
[38:57] all the palaces thereof with fire and
[38:59] destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof
[39:02] so in other words at this point in time
[39:04] Israel is late
[39:06] ruins there's nothing left of Israel are
[39:10] nothing left of the temple and then that
[39:13] escape from the sword carried he away to
[39:15] Babylon where they were servants to him
[39:17] and his sons until the reign of the king
[39:19] of Persia to fulfill the word of the
[39:22] Lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the
[39:24] land had enjoyed her Sabbath's for as
[39:26] long as she laid desolate she kept
[39:28] sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten
[39:32] years what's threescore it's three times
[39:34] 20 is 60 and 10 is 70 there's your 70
[39:37] years that they were in captivity
[39:39] alright so the Israel was in captivity
[39:42] for 70 years they had no city they were
[39:45] driven out of their land does that sound
[39:47] familiar because it's going to happen
[39:49] again during this 70 weeks of Daniel
[39:51] because Titus is going to do the same
[39:53] thing Titus is going to draw it destroy
[39:55] the city knock the wall down take all
[39:57] the things of the of the menorah and
[40:01] holy of holies he's going to take all
[40:02] that back to Rome with him and then
[40:05] Israel is gonna what be dispersed all
[40:07] over the all over the into nations but
[40:12] thank God there in nineteen forty
[40:14] something brother Brahma saw him I'll
[40:16] start coming by I knew he had something
[40:18] to do with his message had something to
[40:21] do with the timing now remembers and
[40:25] they're not gonna take they're not going
[40:26] to go over to Israel when we're going
[40:28] and say brother Brian said brother I'm
[40:30] said they're gonna go who is this guy
[40:32] they missed that forthcoming of Elijah
[40:35] that forthcoming is not to the Jews
[40:38] don't kid yourself there's a fifth
[40:41] coming of Elijah promised to the Jews
[40:43] he'll be a spirit of Moses and Elijah
[40:46] sure he'll have the same spirit of
[40:48] Elijah that brother Branham had on him
[40:50] but it won't be the spirit of brother
[40:51] Branham it'll be the spirit of Elijah on
[40:55] a person a Jew to go over to Israel to
[40:59] preach to those two prophets that's
[41:00] telling you before all these people well
[41:02] not all but several people wanting to go
[41:05] overseas and take the message over there
[41:07] that's okay you get them converted but
[41:08] you're not going to save 144,000 they're
[41:12] saved after we're gone leave them alone
[41:14] we need to worry about ourself cuz until
[41:18] we get out of here
[41:19] we're gonna stay here and they're not
[41:21] going to get their fulfillment of the
[41:23] scripture but guess what the Bible says
[41:25] we're gonna leave in a rapture and then
[41:27] there's 2 witnesses is going to go to
[41:29] Israel and going to bring them to what
[41:31] to their Redemption
[41:33] so there's 76 fold purpose as we get
[41:36] along in here because they come to this
[41:38] back room as we get finished with the
[41:40] background we're going to see that this
[41:42] 6 fold purpose happens when those 2 Jews
[41:45] go to Israel so let's go to Genesis 29
[41:48] and yet this is just for a little bit of
[41:52] backup brother Branham comes in in the
[41:57] daniel 70 week series and he says one
[42:00] week equals seven years now he didn't
[42:03] just pull that out of his hat it's in
[42:06] the Bible alright he had to bring it out
[42:08] of the Bible he couldn't just say okay
[42:10] one week equals seven years well yeah
[42:12] sure it fit but I'm sure the the angel
[42:15] that was with him I'm sure he took him
[42:17] back to Genesis 29 and he looked and he
[42:19] said here you got Jacob working seven
[42:21] years for Rachel amen then he but he got
[42:25] live which was the old Jewish Church
[42:28] because remember they're seven churches
[42:30] in the Old Testament amen and there's
[42:34] seven churches in the New Testament he
[42:37] worked seven years for Leah got Leah and
[42:39] he's got to work seven years to get me
[42:41] in you the Rachel part alright but what
[42:44] is the saying Ginny in Genesis 29 27
[42:46] 2010 is's 2920 says Jacob searched seven
[42:50] years for Rachel and they seemed unto
[42:52] him but a few days free for the love he
[42:55] had for her then Genesis 29 27 says
[42:57] fulfil her week and we will give thee
[43:01] this also for the service which thou has
[43:03] served with me yet seven other years and
[43:06] Jacob did so and fulfilled her week what
[43:09] her seven years so one week equals seven
[43:12] years so now in the seventy weeks of
[43:14] Daniel and we'll get it on the chart a
[43:16] little bit later but this I'm just going
[43:18] to throw this in 70 years
[43:20] our seventy weeks so 70 times seven is
[43:25] 490 years everybody got that same am 70
[43:30] times 7 so it's 70 week
[43:32] some Daniel it's seventy times seven
[43:35] because one week equals seven years so
[43:37] if you got seventy weeks times seven is
[43:40] 490 years so 490 years is the time that
[43:44] God is going to start and build the
[43:48] temple back like he promised we're going
[43:50] to talk about it maybe later on but not
[43:52] now start the temple and then he's going
[43:55] to finish their Redemption in this six
[43:58] fold purpose in this last week which has
[44:00] got to be 490 years that Alright 490
[44:05] years and we'll get into that it's gonna
[44:10] require that you study though it's gonna
[44:12] require that you read the book it listen
[44:15] to the tape or go back through the
[44:18] history because you know brother Branham
[44:19] got all this a lot of his dates and
[44:21] stuff from history books
[44:22] alright but I gave you that chart that
[44:24] you can use and then I've got the other
[44:26] chart that brother Branham drew now will
[44:28] give it out next Sunday
[44:29] but it's the chart that brother Branham
[44:31] drew that Becky his daughter member
[44:36] graphed off to give to the people and it
[44:40] was verified by George Smith that I
[44:41] asked him myself
[44:42] me and dad both did he looked at the
[44:44] picture and you can tell it was typed
[44:47] back in the 60s because it's the old
[44:48] typewriter typing alright and the little
[44:51] and a little bitty well it was supposed
[44:55] to bend the King you know they had the
[44:57] head of gold and the brass and and if
[44:59] you if you're reading your if you listen
[45:01] to the three tape somewhere in there
[45:03] brother branham I think it's them the
[45:04] last one he says Becky it looks like a
[45:06] girl and it does it looks like a girl
[45:08] with a dress on so it's the same
[45:10] identical chart that brother Branham
[45:12] drew and then we have another one
[45:14] somewhere I got to find it where brother
[45:17] Branham drew the same chart on a napkin
[45:18] for a brother the next day at a motel or
[45:22] a meeting at a restaurant so you know we
[45:24] don't want to chain what I'm saying is
[45:25] we're not going to change the chart you
[45:27] can't change the chart to match the
[45:28] Bible that chart matches exactly what
[45:31] the Bible says
[45:32] if not then brother Brown is false why
[45:34] do people why is the first thing that
[45:35] people when they get ready to you know
[45:38] say sayonara to the message what are
[45:40] they the first thing you do well brother
[45:41] Brown was wrong in Daniels in two weeks
[45:44] well no he wasn't
[45:46] he was a prophet he didn't waste three
[45:50] services to be wrong you saw well when
[45:53] the seals opened up will show me one
[45:55] time get bring me one quote where
[45:58] brother branham said because I'm gonna
[46:00] tell you in in the seven seals we just
[46:03] went through them every seal he said I
[46:07] was wrong here I was wrong here this was
[46:10] not what I was thinking this was not
[46:12] remember the fifth seal Jew he thought
[46:14] was us the first seal he thought was a
[46:17] wild horse rider he said I was wrong I
[46:20] was wrong I was wrong show me one time
[46:22] he said I was wrong in Daniel 70 weeks
[46:24] and now this will correct it he always
[46:27] goes back and says see we had to get
[46:30] these Daniel 70 weeks out of the way and
[46:32] you said well I got quote I don't care
[46:34] about you quotes quotes will kill you
[46:38] they verbatim quoted Moses to Jesus and
[46:42] he said your of your father
[46:46] they had Moses his quote book they had
[46:50] ever how many sermons Moses preached
[46:51] they had them all we be of Moses we be
[46:54] of Abraham Jesus said you're of your
[46:56] father the devil so be careful what
[46:59] you're what you're talking about and I'm
[47:01] not trying to be hard I'm just going to
[47:02] tell you that we got a this thing's got
[47:04] to be the old saying was we got to put
[47:06] this thing to bed we got to put this
[47:08] thing where there is no fear people fear
[47:13] less dad said this morning people fear
[47:14] Daniel seventy weeks and they fear the
[47:16] seals I don't fear him at all you know
[47:17] why they fear them because it hadn't
[47:18] been talked whatever that brother has
[47:21] said we don't need teaching anymore he's
[47:22] problem is he's just hanging out enough
[47:24] or he'd have never said that and you
[47:27] know what it does get like I said last
[47:29] Sunday I used Michael for an example you
[47:31] know Michael said he did not like
[47:32] getting up go to school every day school
[47:35] is hard you know playing basketball or
[47:40] baseball that's easy and fun but you
[47:42] know what you gotta go school too so we
[47:45] got to go to school here this may be
[47:47] long drawn-out boring process but you
[47:50] know what it will I believe this time
[47:53] will answer your question because we're
[47:55] going to take it by the Bible and the
[47:58] Bible is faced final resting place
[48:00] it's in the Word of God so let's go to
[48:03] Daniel 9 verse 1 and look next on you
[48:08] quotes we read it last Sunday because
[48:11] last Sunday we spoke on Daniels
[48:13] confession brother Branham said Daniels
[48:16] confession is what brought Gabriel on
[48:18] the scene so maybe if we'll start
[48:20] praying we can get Michael here and then
[48:22] we can get we can get Michael because
[48:24] remember
[48:25] Gabriel is to Israel Gabriel is the
[48:29] announcing angel to Israel Michael is
[48:32] our angel a man Michael is our angel
[48:34] which is Christ
[48:38] so Daniel 9 1 in the year first year of
[48:41] Darius the son of a source of the seat
[48:44] in the Mirta Meade's which was made king
[48:47] over the realm of the Chaldeans in the
[48:48] first year of his reign I Daniel
[48:50] understood by books the number of years
[48:53] where the word of the Lord came to
[48:54] Jeremiah the Prophet that he would
[48:56] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[48:58] of Jerusalem and I set my face into the
[49:03] Lord God to seek by prayer and
[49:05] supplication with fasting and sack cloth
[49:07] and ashes you see how he got an answer
[49:11] from God maybe if we did the same thing
[49:12] we might get an answer from God but he
[49:16] said his face and he said God what are
[49:17] you talking about well and got two more
[49:19] years I understood by books do you
[49:22] understand by books Daniel 9 verse 19 Oh
[49:27] Lord
[49:27] here o Lord forgive Oh Lord hearken and
[49:30] do defer not for thine own sake o my god
[49:34] for thy City and thy people look how
[49:37] many times he connects him in the city
[49:40] the people in the city because when we
[49:42] get into this Daniel 70 weeks with the
[49:44] dates and the times and where everybody
[49:46] says this is wrong and this is this is
[49:49] not what he's saying and all this all
[49:50] this stuff remember he has to restore
[49:54] the people and the city that city is
[49:59] very important because what are they
[50:02] doing now they're over there now trying
[50:04] their best to establish temple worship
[50:06] because if they can get the red heifer
[50:08] if they can get the holy of holies if
[50:10] they can get that menorah back and set
[50:12] that temple up they
[50:14] they the Jews think that the Messiah can
[50:16] come because of what they're doing okay
[50:20] so but we know one thing's for sure the
[50:23] 144,000 they're gonna get saved and
[50:25] they're gonna go in there and say hey
[50:26] that you don't need this when you
[50:28] understand what's gonna happen they're
[50:30] gonna get mad at him o Lord hear o Lord
[50:33] forgive the Lord hearken and do defer
[50:34] not for their own sake o my god for thy
[50:36] city and thy people are called by thy
[50:39] name and while I was speaking and
[50:42] praying and confessing my sins and the
[50:43] sin of my people Israel and presenting
[50:46] my supplication before the Lord my God
[50:48] for the holy mountain of my god yet
[50:50] while I was speaking in prayer even the
[50:52] man Gabriel who might seen in the vision
[50:54] at the beginning being caused to fly
[50:56] swiftly touched me about the time of the
[50:58] evening oblation we read that a few
[51:01] minutes ago and he informed me and
[51:02] talked with mr. doe Daniel I am now come
[51:04] forth to give thee skill and
[51:05] understanding at the beginning of my
[51:08] supplication the commandment came forth
[51:09] and I am come to show thee for thou art
[51:11] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[51:13] matter and consider the vision now let's
[51:17] start with the quotes and let's read
[51:18] them just for a few minutes and this
[51:19] just get a background the first quote
[51:23] here brother Branham says in the Gables
[51:24] instructions annual now there's our
[51:26] lessons for the next three four or five
[51:28] meetings wherever the Lord will reveal
[51:30] seventy of weeks now I'll ask dr. people
[51:34] tonight to put up my board there so I'll
[51:37] be able to mark it down I don't want you
[51:39] to miss it now you've got to study with
[51:41] me and study deep or you'll miss it
[51:43] and I want to draw it out here on the
[51:45] blackboard and then you bring your
[51:47] pencils and paper and write down these
[51:48] dates these times and all about it now
[51:51] the seventy of weeks begins now get this
[51:53] after the church is taken out now
[51:56] everybody understands that say Amen be
[51:59] careful be careful because you look at
[52:04] this and if you read this just this wife
[52:06] said quote will kill you the 70 weeks
[52:08] begins after the church is taken out now
[52:10] if you take what he said that's not true
[52:15] 70 weeks began at 606 BC and consummates
[52:20] on this chart here but if you'll get
[52:25] this key you will understand every quote
[52:28] that you think in your brain right now
[52:29] that's going through your brain that
[52:31] brother Brown said there's only three
[52:32] and a half years left I know that there
[52:34] is there's only 1260 days left of a
[52:36] Ministry of Jesus Christ but that's not
[52:40] the whole week as 1260 days because the
[52:44] Bible said that there's one week left
[52:46] after the rapture so you got to make
[52:47] everything fit but now what's he doing
[52:50] he's bringing all of the 70 weeks begins
[52:53] after the church is taken out because
[52:55] the first part those 69 weeks Israel is
[52:59] truly not being totally restored only in
[53:02] this last week that you've got in your
[53:04] hand is God going to send two people
[53:06] over there and they're going to be
[53:08] brought back by preaching of 1260 days
[53:13] there's two prophets going to redeem the
[53:15] people of Israel everybody got that same
[53:19] man okay so then you know there's quotes
[53:22] were they people ask him is about the
[53:25] seven years he said no no no nenene no
[53:27] it's the last half well it is the last
[53:30] half is the last half of the of the week
[53:32] of the Messiah ministry he's already had
[53:34] three and a half when he was on earth
[53:36] and he's got three and a half for the
[53:37] Jews but that's not the last week
[53:40] because the Bible says there's one week
[53:43] left after the rapture and he shall
[53:46] confirm the covenant with many for one
[53:48] week you can't change that Bible right
[53:50] there and who's he he is the Antichrist
[53:54] because God don't break a covenant man
[53:58] breaks a covenant God does not break a
[54:01] covenant this man shall confirm the
[54:03] covenant for one week and in the midst
[54:05] of the week he shall cause the sacrifice
[54:06] and oblation to cease so in other words
[54:08] he breaks the covenant so that's what
[54:10] that's the Antichrist and do we see that
[54:12] sign no my prophet of God tells us we do
[54:16] not we will not be here
[54:18] he said if you see that beast sign that
[54:20] treaty with Israel you missed the
[54:22] rapture and the Bible says and he shall
[54:25] confirm the covenant with many for one
[54:27] week are seven years we could stop right
[54:35] there cuz they were I guess I'm like you
[54:38] I'm gonna tell y'all like I told those
[54:39] preachers keep
[54:41] bringing me everything you bring me I'm
[54:43] gonna bring you right back to that one
[54:44] Scripture right there
[54:45] explain that scripture to me first and
[54:48] then I'll listen to all this other stuff
[54:49] you got to say but of course they don't
[54:52] anymore and that's okay now 70 weeks
[54:55] begins now get this after the church is
[54:57] taken out because remember God cannot
[54:59] restore Israel while we're still here
[55:03] can't work with both of us at the same
[55:06] time so we've got to be taken out of the
[55:08] way the wild olive branch has got to be
[55:10] taken all the way so God is going to
[55:12] deal with Israel for that last week or
[55:17] seven years that you have here they're
[55:22] okay with that I don't care it doesn't
[55:24] matter to me if you believe it but are
[55:25] you okay with the one I'm saying okay
[55:27] because if you say I don't agree with
[55:30] that I'm gonna go back to Daniel 9:27
[55:31] and he shall confirm to come out with
[55:34] many for one week there's no half weeks
[55:36] in Daniel 70 weeks
[55:39] find me one they're all full weeks okay
[55:46] so everybody understand that say man so
[55:49] the church is gone because look watch
[55:51] watch this revelation 6:1 - revelations
[55:54] 1921 paragraph 71 it's connected with
[55:58] the 70 of weeks
[55:59] therefore we must stop and explain
[56:01] before we go further we must stop and
[56:04] explain while these 70 of weeks because
[56:05] if you don't you'll miss those seals
[56:07] you'll miss the trumpets what you'll
[56:09] miss the placing of them alright they
[56:12] all happen in this last week to the Jews
[56:18] cuz look do we see the plagues no we're
[56:24] already gone do we get the trumpets no
[56:27] they're to Israel we're already gone the
[56:30] last whoa you better not be here on that
[56:32] last whoa you'll be in the third world
[56:34] war
[56:38] so we're gone from revelation 6:1 to
[56:43] 1921 the bride's not even the earth
[56:46] hello
[56:47] I like key three hello
[56:52] hello somebody hello somebody print
[56:56] scenes are good hello somebody but it's
[57:01] not we get the spiritual application of
[57:04] revelations for one to revelations 1921
[57:08] because 1921 this is where we come back
[57:12] right here hey buddy look at your chart
[57:16] don't look at me we come back right here
[57:19] when this millennium begins we have come
[57:22] riding back into the millennium
[57:24] according to revelations 1921 but it's
[57:28] not to us we come back here it's what
[57:30] it's why we come back here is the bride
[57:33] we come back here it's not servants we
[57:35] don't come back here to fulfill any time
[57:39] hey when we take a body change here we
[57:43] have time no longer we don't have to
[57:46] have without that thousand years is not
[57:48] to us that last week is not to us okay
[57:53] so maybe you'll understand a little bit
[57:54] more of what we're going through here
[57:56] because brother Brown said we must stop
[57:58] if you don't you'll miss those seals you
[58:01] missed the trumpets you'll miss the
[58:02] vowels you'll miss the plagues these
[58:05] three unclean spirits like frogs the
[58:07] three woes the casting out of the red
[58:08] dragon and the woman in the Sun that's
[58:11] all Israel sure we get a spiritual
[58:14] application of it you'll miss it all if
[58:16] you don't cuz it takes place right here
[58:18] in this 70th week the one you got in
[58:25] your hand
[58:25] that's the last week that this you're
[58:30] looking at revelation I mean Daniel 9:27
[58:34] what you're holding in your hand is
[58:36] Daniel 9:27 and he shall confirm the
[58:38] covenant with many for one week right
[58:41] here got it cuz remember
[58:44] we go in the rapture right here Gentile
[58:47] rapture Church ages are over we go in a
[58:50] rapture because we have to go in a
[58:52] rapture so that God can go deal with the
[58:54] Jews all right we are not here when God
[58:57] deals with the Jews let me say that one
[58:59] more time God will not deal with us in
[59:00] Israel at the same time Israel has to be
[59:03] our homeland and we have to be gone in
[59:07] the rapture before that last week can
[59:09] take place with brother Brett said it
[59:11] all takes place in that 70th week not
[59:14] that half week didn't say the sixty nine
[59:18] and a half one like most people in the
[59:21] message believe and I hate it but if
[59:22] you're just not been talked cuz brother
[59:25] branham I'm not gonna change a quote
[59:27] he's got and I'm not gonna have to
[59:29] change the Bible for what we're talking
[59:31] about here but I have seen and said in
[59:34] ministers meeting where preachers
[59:36] totally change charts bring scripture in
[59:39] that don't have nothing to it just being
[59:41] totally illiterate about what's going on
[59:44] I told somebody I said you know it's
[59:45] it's kind of like you know you're a big
[59:48] prize fighter and and all of a sudden
[59:51] you know you're Muhammad Ali and all of
[59:53] a sudden
[59:56] Michael Bernoulli at 18 years old or
[59:59] whoever
[59:59] Agios walks up to Muhammad Ali and
[1:00:01] squares him right in the nose and knocks
[1:00:05] him on the ground Muhammad Ali is ill
[1:00:10] because some little pipsqueak popped him
[1:00:13] in the face when he wasn't supposed to
[1:00:14] right we've all been that way and what
[1:00:17] the first thing we do we come out
[1:00:18] fighting we just start flailing and
[1:00:21] jabbing away but maybe that's what
[1:00:25] happened
[1:00:26] now the prophet Daniel meeting paragraph
[1:00:28] 72 I had been in babbling for 68 years
[1:00:32] you want to run references back and save
[1:00:34] yourself some of the time they've had of
[1:00:37] looking it up sixty-eight years he went
[1:00:39] into captivity in BC 606 now here's
[1:00:42] where we're gonna start with the dates
[1:00:45] just keep that in your mind we'll do the
[1:00:47] dates a little bit later but there's one
[1:00:49] of your markers and when the vision came
[1:00:51] to him it was BC 538 538 from 606 least
[1:00:56] 68 68 years have been in babbling
[1:00:59] amongst healings and still had the
[1:01:00] victory
[1:01:01] we can't stay an hour he said that I
[1:01:05] didn't we can't stay an hour
[1:01:09] number two cables instructions to Daniel
[1:01:12] the prophet of God said this is the one
[1:01:14] most important scriptures
[1:01:16] in the Bible what does it do it tells
[1:01:20] the closing of the Jewish nation the
[1:01:22] Jewish people this scripture the seventy
[1:01:25] of weeks it's discloses and tells
[1:01:26] exactly from the time that Daniel
[1:01:28] started there until the end of the
[1:01:30] consummation of what I tell you the end
[1:01:32] the consummation is right here this is
[1:01:34] when Israel is fully restored is when
[1:01:36] they start this 1000 year millennial
[1:01:37] reign that's when they've got their
[1:01:40] people back that's when you've got us
[1:01:42] back there that's when they've got that
[1:01:44] Millennial temple built and we're fixing
[1:01:46] to take a thousand years of millennial
[1:01:48] reign thereby okay with that all right
[1:01:51] so maybe he's heard this over and over
[1:01:52] but some have not so just act like you
[1:01:55] haven't heard them heard it before it's
[1:01:58] one of the most important scriptures in
[1:02:00] the book what does it do it tells the
[1:02:01] closing of the Jewish nation the Jewish
[1:02:03] people this scripture the seventy of
[1:02:06] weeks it discloses and tells exactly
[1:02:08] from the time that Daniel started there
[1:02:10] until the end of the consummation is one
[1:02:12] of the greatest time pizzas
[1:02:14] how many heard me say if you want to
[1:02:16] know what day of the week it is look at
[1:02:18] the calendar if you want to know what
[1:02:20] time we're living in watch the Jews
[1:02:22] that's right there's God's calendar
[1:02:24] taken from right here
[1:02:26] anything loads in any Bible scholar
[1:02:28] anyone will tell you that this is the
[1:02:30] time peace the Jews all right number
[1:02:35] three Gables instructions to Daniel
[1:02:39] Israel's returning to her homeland what
[1:02:42] day that God determines Israel to be a
[1:02:45] nation no not when the UN decided it
[1:02:47] because that was 1947-48
[1:02:51] sorry they started in 47 and then made
[1:02:53] it in 48 you're right thank you sister
[1:02:55] Trudy but not when they decided this is
[1:02:59] when God determines Israel to be a
[1:03:02] nation that's the day that they'll never
[1:03:04] be another Gentile saved I'll prove that
[1:03:08] by the seventy of weeks if I can only
[1:03:11] find them days I'm going over to get the
[1:03:13] astronomy calendar and the Julian and
[1:03:15] the astronomy and the Roman and all of
[1:03:17] them there's somewhere somewhere there's
[1:03:20] something God knows about it and that he
[1:03:23] is able to reveal it I know the Julian
[1:03:27] calendar has 365 and a quarter days in
[1:03:29] the year so
[1:03:30] all they're all mixed up but there's a
[1:03:32] truth somewhere
[1:03:34] alright brother branham debt if you
[1:03:36] don't know the story behind it he
[1:03:38] preached Gables instructions to Daniel
[1:03:40] Sunday morning he preached the six fold
[1:03:42] purpose Sunday night and then the next
[1:03:44] Sunday week the next week Sunday he
[1:03:47] preached the 70th week and put all the
[1:03:50] dates in the times at this time right
[1:03:52] now he doesn't have them he's just doing
[1:03:55] like we're doing he's just sending a
[1:03:56] foundation to build on all right look at
[1:04:01] number four Gables instructions to
[1:04:03] Daniel the Jew that we know that's not
[1:04:07] the real Jew the real Jews that real
[1:04:10] Orthodox who has not defiled himself
[1:04:12] with the things of the world who's not
[1:04:14] went out and joined of the churches
[1:04:17] that's the one that's returning you
[1:04:19] under living on cheese and bread upon
[1:04:21] the hillsides not allowed in the old
[1:04:23] city did you know that the Orthodox was
[1:04:25] not allowed in the old city I had to
[1:04:28] build them a city on this side in the
[1:04:29] no-man's land with machine guns pointing
[1:04:31] both ways but she's beginning to put
[1:04:34] forth her buds a man and a man the time
[1:04:36] as a hymn
[1:04:36] there's Ishmael and Isaac standing there
[1:04:39] fussing about the land yet but she
[1:04:41] belongs to Israel if you happen to go
[1:04:44] over in the New Jerusalem they won't let
[1:04:46] you come to the old Jerusalem you'll
[1:04:47] have to go there first and let them
[1:04:49] explain it all to you the Arabs then
[1:04:51] take you to over to the other side
[1:04:52] that's its most children but wait
[1:04:55] there's coming a time when God's
[1:04:56] children's gonna take her over that's
[1:04:59] right he's not talking about us he's
[1:05:02] talking about Israel we're not gonna
[1:05:05] take over a city our city we don't have
[1:05:08] one remember Abraham didn't have one he
[1:05:10] was looking for one all right Jerusalem
[1:05:13] will be rebuilt again the daily
[1:05:16] sacrifice will be set up and the
[1:05:18] Antichrist will make a covenant for them
[1:05:20] last seven weeks now he didn't make a
[1:05:22] mistake there because it's seven years
[1:05:24] in ain't seven weeks its last seven
[1:05:26] years everybody got that say man okay
[1:05:29] I'm not trying to change anything but
[1:05:31] that's what he's talking about because
[1:05:33] last seven years that put 49 years after
[1:05:36] the rapture that don't that's not right
[1:05:37] okay and in the midst of it he'll break
[1:05:40] that covenant
[1:05:40] and turn them all into the Kosta Tallis
[1:05:43] ISM the abomination will spread over the
[1:05:46] whole thing like that and then the end
[1:05:48] shall be watch everybody got that say
[1:05:53] man all right you okay with that all
[1:05:57] right let's start now here we'll just
[1:05:58] for a few minutes with the six full
[1:05:59] purpose and then we'll if this is enough
[1:06:02] of a stage to set I believe till we can
[1:06:04] start in the six fold purpose we'll read
[1:06:05] one of them today and not be so long six
[1:06:08] full purpose 70 weeks are determined
[1:06:10] upon thy people and upon thy holy city
[1:06:13] to do these six things so inside of
[1:06:17] Daniel 70 weeks everybody look at me
[1:06:20] inside of Daniel 70 weeks these six
[1:06:23] things have to happen that just that's
[1:06:27] just plain English read it seventy weeks
[1:06:29] are determined upon thy people and upon
[1:06:32] thy holy city to finish the
[1:06:34] transgression to make an end of sins to
[1:06:36] make reconciliation for iniquity to
[1:06:39] bring in everlasting righteousness to
[1:06:41] seal up the vision and prophecy and to
[1:06:43] anoint the most holy that six things has
[1:06:45] to happen inside of the seventy weeks of
[1:06:48] Daniel everybody got that same n now I
[1:06:51] want to ask you a question
[1:06:53] if as most people believe look at your
[1:06:55] chart now most people in dimensions
[1:06:58] believe there's only three and a half
[1:06:59] years left after the rapture to fulfil
[1:07:01] the seventy weeks of Daniel do you hear
[1:07:03] me what I'm saying that is false
[1:07:07] let me read Daniel 9:27 again and he
[1:07:10] shall confirm the covenant with many for
[1:07:11] one week
[1:07:12] not a half a wait one week because I
[1:07:16] want to ask you a question if all six of
[1:07:18] these things brother a if all six of
[1:07:20] these things have to be finished inside
[1:07:22] of that 490 years our seventy weeks
[1:07:25] everybody got that that's what the Bible
[1:07:27] says these six things has to happen to
[1:07:31] restore Israel in the city because what
[1:07:35] happens right here in verse 25 it says
[1:07:38] know therefore and understand what he's
[1:07:41] beginning to tell us all the way that
[1:07:43] it's going to happen but in Daniel 9:24
[1:07:46] he tells you the whole thing this is
[1:07:48] what's going to happen there's 70 weeks
[1:07:50] determined to do these six things now I
[1:07:53] want to ask you a question
[1:07:54] if as most people in the message believe
[1:07:57] and I say 99% of them that right here
[1:07:59] for you look at your chart right here is
[1:08:01] the middle of the week 1260 days is half
[1:08:05] it's Trina half years according to the
[1:08:08] to the calendar dr. Julie encounter
[1:08:10] calendars do okay with that all right
[1:08:12] now that's all if they say them then
[1:08:16] what they're saying is is that's the end
[1:08:17] of the 70 weeks of Daniel now how in the
[1:08:20] name of the good Lord are you gonna have
[1:08:23] a battle of Armageddon right here right
[1:08:26] but if you take all six and put them in
[1:08:29] the seventy weeks last they say you got
[1:08:31] to bring in everlasting righteousness
[1:08:33] before the Tribulation Period
[1:08:35] I mean before the Battle of Armageddon
[1:08:36] can't have you can't seal up the vision
[1:08:40] and prophecy brother Brown says in the
[1:08:41] North the most holy means we're riding
[1:08:43] in the Millennium because we are the
[1:08:45] anointing to the temple that's way over
[1:08:46] here so they can't be three and a half
[1:08:50] years left of time they might understand
[1:08:53] me time there's not three and a half
[1:08:56] years of time left
[1:08:58] there's seven years according to Daniel
[1:09:00] 9:27 I'm gonna keep reading that and
[1:09:03] you're gonna hate me afterward but I
[1:09:04] really don't care and he shall confirm
[1:09:06] the covenant with many for one week one
[1:09:09] week and in the midst of the week he's
[1:09:12] gonna step in and say I'm done you know
[1:09:14] what and so is the two prophets they're
[1:09:17] gonna say alright our 1260 days are done
[1:09:20] we're going in a rapture but he's gonna
[1:09:23] bring in everlasting righteousness he's
[1:09:24] gonna sell the vision and prophecy and
[1:09:26] who's gonna anoint the most holy
[1:09:27] that can't happen on this side of the
[1:09:29] Battle of Armageddon everybody get that
[1:09:32] can't happen so there's seven years of
[1:09:36] time left there's only three and a half
[1:09:39] years of a prophecy of two prophets to
[1:09:43] Israel that's according to the Bible but
[1:09:47] according to Daniel 9:27 there's one
[1:09:49] week left after the rapture brother
[1:09:51] Brown says it's seven times in the book
[1:09:53] that there's one week left after the
[1:09:55] rapture with what they're not getting is
[1:09:57] they're not getting that that's the time
[1:09:59] element the time element of the 70 weeks
[1:10:02] has to bring us to the consummation
[1:10:07] that the consummation no that's the
[1:10:10] consummation that's when Ezekiel 43 44
[1:10:13] the Millennial temple will be built by
[1:10:16] the Jews and then we ride into that
[1:10:19] millenium temple they gotta have a time
[1:10:21] to build it so bring me whatever quote
[1:10:28] you want there alright if you'll place
[1:10:33] it in the right place because the
[1:10:36] Bible's no we're not gonna change the
[1:10:37] Bible he shall confirm the covenant with
[1:10:40] many for one week and in the midst of
[1:10:42] the week he calls the sacrifice and
[1:10:44] oblation deceased but there's no way
[1:10:46] that six fold purpose can be fulfilled
[1:10:48] only in those 1260 days can happen how
[1:10:55] can you bring in everlasting
[1:10:56] righteousness and then destroy
[1:10:57] everything cuz if you'll welcome we'll
[1:11:00] give you the other chart that little
[1:11:01] line right there is when the Battle of
[1:11:02] Armageddon is going to start that's a
[1:11:04] nuclear destruction that's going to
[1:11:06] destroy what this world you know of it's
[1:11:09] gonna destroy it so how you gonna bring
[1:11:13] in everlasting righteousness over here
[1:11:14] and then destroy it how you gonna seal
[1:11:16] up the vision and prophecy in the people
[1:11:18] and destroy them how you gonna know what
[1:11:19] the most totally over here and then
[1:11:21] destroy him can't happen when I started
[1:11:24] reading this brother Dale the first
[1:11:25] thing said he said make sure you get the
[1:11:27] six fold purpose right he said if you
[1:11:28] get it right he said you'll get your
[1:11:30] chart right and you'll get what brother
[1:11:31] Branham meant you'll get it right
[1:11:33] because of the six fold purpose and I
[1:11:36] believe that's what we're we're starting
[1:11:38] on now so look number five in two men
[1:11:42] the first thing we wish to draw your
[1:11:45] attention to is the infallibility of
[1:11:47] God's Word God keeps his word to the
[1:11:50] letter and tonight we want to fasten our
[1:11:53] thought on that let God keeps his word
[1:11:55] we can rest assure of anything that God
[1:11:57] has said in his word to be the truth and
[1:12:00] faith does not rest upon the shifting
[1:12:02] sands of men's idea or mans theology
[1:12:06] everybody say amen to that
[1:12:08] amen but it has its final resting place
[1:12:12] on the unmovable rock of God's eternal
[1:12:15] word the word
[1:12:19] number six God hiding himself in
[1:12:21] simplicity and remember that's the same
[1:12:23] spirit from the days of Noah that said
[1:12:25] there's no rain up there we can shoot
[1:12:27] the moon with instruments and there's no
[1:12:28] rain but if God said there would be rain
[1:12:31] there for faith is the substance of
[1:12:33] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:12:35] that's not seen and faith takes its
[1:12:37] final resting place on the Word of God
[1:12:40] that's where it finds its resting place
[1:12:43] I just want to bring those two quotes in
[1:12:45] there to tell you that we're gonna base
[1:12:47] everything we have on the Word of God
[1:12:49] amen we got to take it back to the Word
[1:12:52] of God if it doesn't fit then we're
[1:12:53] wrong we're wrong prophet is not wrong
[1:12:56] Bible's not wrong we're on all right if
[1:13:00] we get it wrong somewhere in there's got
[1:13:01] to be the right brother Branham did not
[1:13:04] spend three to our services to be wrong
[1:13:09] he was so confident I'll show you many
[1:13:12] many quotes he's so confident even says
[1:13:14] it's that's that the Lord yet the people
[1:13:18] want to tear it to pieces but if you'll
[1:13:22] put your faith in the Word of God and
[1:13:24] read what the Bible says you'll know
[1:13:29] what that prophet said all right and
[1:13:32] that's what we're gonna do as we go on
[1:13:35] through this 70 weeks of Daniel 6 fold
[1:13:37] purpose number seven seventy weeks are
[1:13:39] determined upon thy people for what
[1:13:42] purpose
[1:13:42] whose people was it determined upon
[1:13:46] Daniel's people the Jews and what was it
[1:13:50] determined for upon not only Daniel but
[1:13:53] upon Daniel's holy city Daniels holy
[1:13:57] city now class what was Daniel's holy
[1:13:59] city congregation says Jerusalem alright
[1:14:03] so now I wrote myself a little note you
[1:14:05] can read it there's redemption of the
[1:14:07] Jews and the city so we've got to take
[1:14:09] both because if you don't take both then
[1:14:14] you're gonna get the six fold purpose
[1:14:15] wrong again because how you gonna build
[1:14:18] a Millennial temple over here during the
[1:14:20] same time the two witnesses are here
[1:14:22] which is not which is not which is
[1:14:24] contrary to the Bible and then the
[1:14:26] Battle of Armageddon you're gonna
[1:14:27] destroy it all can't have God's not
[1:14:30] gonna build a temple and then destroy
[1:14:33] amen so there's got to be an answer but
[1:14:36] the brim said there's got to be an
[1:14:37] answer somewhere six full purpose number
[1:14:40] eight now I want to know friends that's
[1:14:41] striking on these things I'm certainly
[1:14:43] leaving out weeks of teaching but just
[1:14:45] kind of hitting it so that when the
[1:14:46] weather cools off oh I wish you would
[1:14:48] hear two are a little later when we get
[1:14:50] into those seals vowels trumpets all
[1:14:53] these things that I can refer back and
[1:14:55] say do you remember on the seventy weeks
[1:14:58] of Daniel do you remember the church age
[1:15:00] when it went up and what taking place
[1:15:02] and these seven weeks of Daniel 70 weeks
[1:15:05] of Daniel covers from the going up of
[1:15:07] the church until the coming back of the
[1:15:09] church that space is what it covers now
[1:15:12] not only seventy weeks of Daniel part of
[1:15:15] it because remember the 70 weeks of
[1:15:17] Daniel beginning 606 BC to get all the
[1:15:22] things back together to come up to this
[1:15:24] time to where the Messiah has to come
[1:15:26] because it says in Daniel 9 we're just
[1:15:30] saying Daniel 9:26 and after threescore
[1:15:34] and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off
[1:15:36] you got to bring them a sign in there
[1:15:37] and you got to have him cut off from the
[1:15:39] Jews to bring it in to us the Gentiles
[1:15:41] okay everybody all right now not all 70
[1:15:48] weeks of Daniel part of it 70 weeks are
[1:15:50] determined now there's a six fold
[1:15:52] purpose to his visit telling him what
[1:15:54] was going to come to pass
[1:15:56] now there's a six full purpose of his
[1:15:59] coming now tonight I think they'll leave
[1:16:01] off well here in the scriptures of we're
[1:16:03] weird with that this morning there's a
[1:16:05] six fold purpose now continuing down 70
[1:16:07] weeks are determined he starts reading
[1:16:09] the scripture upon thy people now
[1:16:10] remember that is all the journey of
[1:16:12] Israelites will have on this earth they
[1:16:15] are determined seventy weeks is just
[1:16:18] determined that's all that's lauded to
[1:16:21] the Jews so there's only the 490 years
[1:16:23] lauded to the Jews everybody got that
[1:16:25] not no halves no thirds no force 70
[1:16:31] weeks right upon thy people and upon thy
[1:16:36] holy city therefore this 70 weeks this
[1:16:39] is brother Branham interpolating now
[1:16:41] don't miss it it will reveal from that
[1:16:43] time to the end of the Jews and
[1:16:46] also to the end of Jerusalem until they
[1:16:49] be a new city built because remember go
[1:16:51] back to your Bible what happens with the
[1:16:55] mosque of Omar which is right in the
[1:16:57] middle of the new city of Jerusalem
[1:17:00] prophet of God said they'll drop a bomb
[1:17:02] right in the middle of that thing and
[1:17:04] blow it to pieces well that's gonna
[1:17:05] completely destroy the old city because
[1:17:08] it's got to be destroyed this new
[1:17:09] millennial temple is new it's a new
[1:17:12] temple oh you'll get something if you'll
[1:17:17] just you just gotta just think just
[1:17:19] think think think and you'll get this
[1:17:21] therefore there's 70 weeks now don't
[1:17:24] miss it it will reveal from that time to
[1:17:25] the end of the Jews and also to the end
[1:17:27] of Jerusalem until there'll be a new
[1:17:29] city built so now if Daniel 70 weeks
[1:17:32] ends right here
[1:17:34] lightin 99 percent of the people in the
[1:17:36] message believe where are you gonna
[1:17:38] build a new city yet gotta have time
[1:17:44] time time we're talking about time Jews
[1:17:49] or a time peace you and I are not we're
[1:17:52] eternal creatures they are a time peace
[1:17:55] alright cuz look we've had we've had
[1:18:00] from the time Christ died until today as
[1:18:03] Gentiles to receive messages right there
[1:18:08] was no time but now remember Israel when
[1:18:12] them two prophets start preaching they
[1:18:14] preach 1260 days that's it this thing
[1:18:18] ain't going on no further
[1:18:19] the Bible says we'll read it in a few
[1:18:23] minutes the Bible says in Revelations
[1:18:25] where's 11 says I'll give my power to
[1:18:29] two witnesses and they shall prophesy
[1:18:31] one thousand two hundred and threescore
[1:18:32] days clothed in sackcloth and ashes
[1:18:34] that's all they get they get a time
[1:18:40] until there's a new city built now I
[1:18:43] hope we get into it real good and eat
[1:18:45] tonight or determined upon thy people
[1:18:46] and upon thy holy city to do what number
[1:18:50] one is finish the transgression so let's
[1:18:54] read what brother Branham says about
[1:18:55] that and then we will review it back
[1:18:58] next Sunday and starting
[1:18:59] we try to get all the six in real quick
[1:19:02] here six full purpose the gables visit
[1:19:04] to Daniel number nine now if we get back
[1:19:06] into Daniel again we'll find out that in
[1:19:08] Daniel we find out here the twenty
[1:19:10] fourth verse to finish the transgression
[1:19:12] to finish white to finish Israel's
[1:19:16] transgression what is they transgress it
[1:19:19] is to go against something what did I
[1:19:21] just tell you back in in Chronicles and
[1:19:24] all that God sent all them prophets
[1:19:26] every time they'd send them a prophet
[1:19:27] Israel would just be contrary they
[1:19:29] wouldn't they transgress they did they
[1:19:31] didn't want it it's to go against
[1:19:34] something what they go against they
[1:19:36] didn't go against them prophets remember
[1:19:38] that one prophet said god they're not
[1:19:41] listening to me God told the Prophet
[1:19:44] it's not you they turned down it's me
[1:19:47] they're turning down can we be doing the
[1:19:51] same thing today turning down the very
[1:19:55] thing it's going to change us and get us
[1:19:56] out of here a transgress against me is
[1:19:59] to do groan do wrong to me transgress
[1:20:02] against you is to do a wrong to you so
[1:20:05] Israel did a wrong to God and in this
[1:20:08] 70th week not half in this 70th week
[1:20:15] what's going to happen God is going to
[1:20:18] finish the transgression of Israel
[1:20:20] finish the transgression we'll be
[1:20:22] turning away the ungodliness from Jacob
[1:20:24] and then all Israel will be born again
[1:20:27] all of them will receive the Holy Ghost
[1:20:31] everybody got that finish the
[1:20:33] transgression will turn away the
[1:20:35] ungodliness from Jacob
[1:20:36] that's your first part of the seventh of
[1:20:39] the six fold purpose because they did
[1:20:41] they transgress they turned him down
[1:20:43] they said no we don't want it so through
[1:20:47] two prophets what's going to happen do
[1:20:49] two prophets they're going to turn right
[1:20:51] around and they're going to point them
[1:20:53] not to Matthew Mark Luke and John at the
[1:20:55] moment
[1:20:57] hey Israel can read the New Testament
[1:21:01] now the literal New Testament Israel can
[1:21:04] read it now they just don't believe it
[1:21:06] right but they believe that Old
[1:21:09] Testament so when you go over in the Old
[1:21:11] Testament you take two prophets
[1:21:13] Moses and Elijah and you go over there
[1:21:15] and they start preaching they're gonna
[1:21:17] preach Christ out of the Old Testament
[1:21:21] bring him into the New Testament and say
[1:21:24] you missed this man because remember
[1:21:27] they're going to preach Christ so much
[1:21:28] to the it to Israel - over there and I
[1:21:31] can't maybe he's not in Ezekiel but it's
[1:21:32] over there somewhere where he's they say
[1:21:34] where did you get those scars he said in
[1:21:37] the house of my friends they preach
[1:21:39] Christ so much and so real don't you
[1:21:42] know what Christ is not gonna be there
[1:21:44] but Christ is not here standing in front
[1:21:45] of you today
[1:21:46] but the Spirit of Christ is there's a
[1:21:49] spirit of Christ that standing here
[1:21:51] trying to teach you something okay and
[1:21:55] it's up to you to take you to receive it
[1:21:56] or fall asleep or do whatever you're
[1:21:58] doing so but this has nothing to do with
[1:22:02] us this is Israel our Redemption we have
[1:22:06] a six fold purpose for our Redemption
[1:22:08] it's called seal number one number two
[1:22:11] number three number four number five
[1:22:13] number six what's the first seal first
[1:22:20] seal we covered it is a wild horse rider
[1:22:22] but it also types what justification
[1:22:26] what's God trying to do what's God
[1:22:29] trying to do he's trying to justify
[1:22:32] Israel because you know what he
[1:22:35] justified you so much whatever you did
[1:22:38] in the past every how much you turn
[1:22:40] guard down ever how much happened if
[1:22:42] you're truly justified God has forgot
[1:22:46] that and he'll never bring it up again
[1:22:48] so same way with Israel God's to two
[1:22:51] prophets are going to save and fill
[1:22:54] those 144,000 with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:56] through justification through
[1:22:58] sanctification and through the baptism
[1:23:00] of the Holy Ghost they're gonna see
[1:23:02] that's why I got that right here there's
[1:23:04] only three processes of grace remember
[1:23:06] justification sanctification about
[1:23:08] kissing the Holy Ghost justification
[1:23:10] did he not finish her transgression the
[1:23:12] day he justified you didn't can't hold
[1:23:16] one thing against you if you're truly
[1:23:17] justified cannot hold one thing those
[1:23:21] who he has justified he is already
[1:23:23] glorified
[1:23:24] but all Israel will be born again all of
[1:23:27] them will receive the holy spirit now
[1:23:29] let's read Romans 11 because this brings
[1:23:33] in the ungodliness from Jacob watch for
[1:23:35] if God spared not the natural branches
[1:23:37] take heed lest he also spare not thee
[1:23:40] behold therefore the goodness and
[1:23:42] severity of God on them which fell
[1:23:45] severity but toward thee goodness
[1:23:47] if thou continue in his goodness
[1:23:49] otherwise they'll also shall be cut off
[1:23:53] now remember this is the story of the
[1:23:56] olive tree now who is the olive tree
[1:23:58] Israel is the olive tree Israel olive
[1:24:02] tree has branches but there was a wild
[1:24:06] olive tree you're looking at him and
[1:24:15] everybody says they meant and they'll
[1:24:18] same to you and they also if they abide
[1:24:21] not still in unbelief shall be graffed
[1:24:23] in for God is able to graft them in
[1:24:26] again now what is he saying he's taking
[1:24:28] the regular olive tree because what
[1:24:31] happened was if you'll go back in the
[1:24:32] Old Testament God whacked the branches
[1:24:36] off of that olive tree which was Israel
[1:24:38] cut her off divorced her I just read it
[1:24:40] to you divorced her and put her away but
[1:24:42] now he's able to graft them in again
[1:24:44] he's going to right here under 1260 days
[1:24:48] he's now dealing with this people right
[1:24:51] here though watch for if thou wert cut
[1:24:55] out of the olive tree which is wild by
[1:24:57] nature and we're graft contrary to
[1:25:00] nature into a good olive tree that's us
[1:25:03] how much more show these which be the
[1:25:05] natural branches be grafted into their
[1:25:08] own olive tree God cut Israel off for
[1:25:11] tooth for seven Church ages grafted in a
[1:25:15] wild olive tree me and you the Gentiles
[1:25:18] grafted in a wild olive tree but God's
[1:25:20] not going to kill the tree the tree is
[1:25:24] still an olive tree what are we doing
[1:25:26] we're living off the life of that olive
[1:25:28] tree amen but God's not going to kill
[1:25:33] the tree he's going to take us in a
[1:25:35] rapture and he's going to graph the
[1:25:37] right back in that's what he says right
[1:25:39] here and how much more shall these which
[1:25:41] be the natural branch be graphed into
[1:25:44] their own olive tree for I would not
[1:25:46] brethren that should be ignorant of this
[1:25:48] mystery lest you should be wise in your
[1:25:51] own conceits that blindness in part has
[1:25:54] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[1:25:56] the Gentiles be come in they're blinded
[1:25:59] right now so they can't you can't finish
[1:26:03] the transgression somebody's blind God's
[1:26:06] got to open their eyes but he only opens
[1:26:08] their eyes when you and I leave through
[1:26:11] two prophets and so all Israel shall be
[1:26:14] saved as it is written there shall come
[1:26:17] out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn
[1:26:19] away ungodliness from Jacob for this is
[1:26:23] my covenant unto them when I shall take
[1:26:25] away their sins he's starting the
[1:26:29] process of bringing Israel not back to
[1:26:32] wife again can't do it he's divorced her
[1:26:35] she's already went out another man's he
[1:26:37] can't take her back but he can bring her
[1:26:40] to a place and restore her to a place
[1:26:42] that 144,000 can live in that temple
[1:26:48] within that city with us but they're not
[1:26:50] bribed their servants and then untold
[1:26:53] millions and billions of Jews what about
[1:26:56] the fifth seal Jew they get eternal life
[1:26:58] and they didn't care whether Jesus was
[1:26:59] Christ or whatever he was because God
[1:27:02] blinded them right here blindness in
[1:27:04] part has happened to Israel until the
[1:27:09] fullness of the Gentiles be come in he's
[1:27:12] gonna lift it off of their eyes two
[1:27:14] prophets are gonna prophesy and they're
[1:27:16] gonna receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:18] Ghost
[1:27:18] which will make them servants he
[1:27:20] justifies them by these three processes
[1:27:23] of finishing transgression make an end
[1:27:25] of sin and make reconciliation for their
[1:27:28] iniquity let's read revelations 11:1 and
[1:27:31] there was given me a reed like unto a
[1:27:32] rod and the angel stood saying arise and
[1:27:35] measure the temple of God and the altar
[1:27:37] and them that worship therein but the
[1:27:41] court which is without the temple leave
[1:27:42] out and measure it not for it is given
[1:27:44] unto the Gentiles and the Holy City
[1:27:46] shall they tread under foot forty and
[1:27:49] two months
[1:27:50] what is forty
[1:27:51] two months I'm gonna wait till somebody
[1:27:54] says what it is three and a half years
[1:27:58] thank you okay and I will give power D
[1:28:02] Anika to figured that one out and I will
[1:28:05] give power unto my two witnesses and
[1:28:07] they shall prophesy 1260 days or three
[1:28:12] scores three times twenty clothed in
[1:28:15] sackcloth so 1260 days it's three and a
[1:28:17] half years according to the Jewish
[1:28:19] calendar thereby got that same man
[1:28:20] according to 30 days to a month that's
[1:28:23] where brother Brennan found his date set
[1:28:25] he went back and found what God's
[1:28:28] calendar a man not the Jewish I mean not
[1:28:31] the Julian calendar not the Roman
[1:28:33] calendar it's always 165 them and or 365
[1:28:37] and a quarter and all these different
[1:28:38] things
[1:28:39] but God's real calendar is 360 days to a
[1:28:44] year so we're starting on the six fold
[1:28:46] purpose I want you to look at that chart
[1:28:47] just keep it remember one thing's for
[1:28:50] sure we're not I'm not trying to be a
[1:28:53] smart aleck by no means I just want us
[1:28:55] to see it I've had so many people some
[1:28:59] of them some of the quests most
[1:29:01] questions you get asked when you go
[1:29:03] somewhere is about Daniel 70 weeks
[1:29:05] especially if you make mention of it
[1:29:08] because it's not being preached I'm it's
[1:29:10] just not it's not being preached it's
[1:29:12] being preached more by denominational
[1:29:14] people in my heavens they've got it all
[1:29:16] different kind of things they've got an
[1:29:18] brother branham will covered if you'll
[1:29:20] read your 6 Pope I mean you're Gabriel
[1:29:22] instructions to Daniel that the
[1:29:23] Millerites thought it was 1919 or 1917
[1:29:27] somewhere in there and they turned in to
[1:29:29] be seventh-day Adventist he tells you
[1:29:31] the whole story but they went up on a
[1:29:32] mountain and had wanes they thought the
[1:29:34] rapture was gonna take place because
[1:29:35] they had figured out that Daniel 70
[1:29:37] weeks was gonna end by some date in 1919
[1:29:41] brother Brahim said I can tell you
[1:29:42] something happened in 1919 he said but
[1:29:46] it wasn't that hey man so we we got a
[1:29:48] prophet that's gonna tell us exactly
[1:29:52] what that Bible says he's not gonna
[1:29:54] deviate one bit from the Bible he cannot
[1:29:57] deviate from the Bible or he is a false
[1:30:00] prophet and we know he's not I know he's
[1:30:02] not what you have to decide whether you
[1:30:04] know

[1:30:54] shake this thing one last time if you

[1:33:10] Hey
[1:33:16] so
[1:33:19] or
[1:33:21] so
[1:33:24] go to mind affairs what would a father
[1:33:27] be if you asked for bread and he give
[1:33:30] you a rock that's for fish and he give
[1:33:34] you a scorpion we're children of God
[1:33:38] living way below our privileges we have
[1:33:42] a problem or anything in our life take
[1:33:44] it to the Father like we were talking
[1:33:46] about this morning you know it I believe
[1:33:49] brother Dale has has made us good rough
[1:33:54] Christians what we don't have to cry out
[1:33:58] for brother Dale to pray for us ever
[1:33:59] ever five minutes and he's listening now
[1:34:05] he'll know because they're listening
[1:34:07] going up the road that he's built a
[1:34:11] group of people that are rough he's
[1:34:13] rough on us they ain't no doubt but you
[1:34:15] know what is on him miss love its
[1:34:17] correction and if we don't take
[1:34:20] correction to Bibles plane what we are
[1:34:23] so if it's sent out of love like it is
[1:34:26] then we need to take it as love but
[1:34:29] let's not be sniffling babbling babies
[1:34:31] anymore grow up grow up in God you in
[1:34:38] your closet at home you ask for God to
[1:34:43] give you don't say now if I can get to
[1:34:44] church and get brothers that's not in
[1:34:48] the Bible
[1:34:49] no we're in the Bible of this thing you
[1:34:51] got to go find a preacher to pray for
[1:34:52] you
[1:34:53] the Bible says lay hands on the sick and
[1:34:55] they shall recover doesn't say you got
[1:34:58] to pray it just says lay hands how many
[1:35:00] times your brother Dale done that many
[1:35:02] times somebody say I got a backache or
[1:35:06] something he'll go outside and shake
[1:35:07] your hand and if he'll put that hand on
[1:35:09] your back or on your shoulder and he's
[1:35:12] praying for you without nobody ever
[1:35:14] knowing that said to me that's what it
[1:35:17] is
[1:35:17] you know you have all the emotion you
[1:35:21] want to but I want results and I believe
[1:35:26] we're getting results because God's
[1:35:28] doing what he said he would do he's
[1:35:31] gonna build a group of people that'll be
[1:35:34] able to stand the pressure of this
[1:35:36] endtime not a bunch of babbling babies
[1:35:40] but some real true hardened
[1:35:44] battle-hardened brother Brown said
[1:35:46] battle-scarred veterans that's what God
[1:35:49] wants and that's what we're gonna be we
[1:35:52] just gotta keep pressing on keep
[1:35:55] pressing on those who endure to the end
[1:35:57] shall be saved

[1:36:15] Roberts that God will not just bring him
[1:36:18] out of what he's in but to bring him out
[1:36:20] of all that you know he was paralyzed
[1:36:21] there before he went before he fell so
[1:36:23] we're just gonna pray that God's gonna
[1:36:25] restore all that because we're gonna ask
[1:36:27] we're gonna take that petition to the
[1:36:28] Heavenly Father we're not gonna have to
[1:36:30] go through 14 dead Saints we're not
[1:36:33] Catholics we come boldly to the throne
[1:36:36] of grace if you can't come boldly to the
