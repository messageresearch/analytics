[0:01] so well back up just a minute or Paul is
[0:05] ignoring the people rejoice with them
[0:09] that do rejoice and weep with them that
[0:10] weep our problem is if we rejoice
[0:15] another people we we should rejoice when
[0:19] they were Georgian week when they leave
[0:20] enter in with their Tsar be at the same
[0:23] mind one toward another minds not high
[0:27] things do not set your mind on high
[0:31] things but condescend to men of low
[0:35] estate remember brother Brennan said the
[0:38] granite stone the greatest man he ever
[0:40] met made you feel good made you feel
[0:43] like you were the one that was the
[0:44] greatest right and it says associate
[0:48] with the humble the men of low estate be
[0:52] not wise in your own conceits
[0:54] your own estimation right recompense to
[1:00] no man evil for evil remember we're not
[1:03] in the eye for an eye a tooth for tooth
[1:04] partisans Christians died for an eye
[1:07] tooth for tooth those fish steal dude
[1:09] we've been talking about right cuz they
[1:12] want to avenge the word avenge and not
[1:15] being in a critical tabulating provide
[1:18] things honest inside of all men know
[1:21] that I want to see this before I want to
[1:22] talk about just a minute Paul said if it
[1:26] be possible now this so this is not a
[1:28] commandment he didn't say I command you
[1:34] live peaceably with all men no he says
[1:38] if it be possible as much as lies in you
[1:42] as much as you got inside yourself live
[1:46] peaceable with all men all right so
[1:49] that's that's kind of the way it is I
[1:51] mean is we go up the statue a perfect
[1:53] man we learn to live more peaceable
[1:54] because of difference and patience or
[1:57] not gardening this for brotherly
[1:59] kindness
[2:00] that's what lying in you as much as what
[2:03] was in the
[2:04] in other words and what's inside of you
[2:05] as much as it depends on in you live
[2:12] peaceably with all men dearly beloved
[2:16] avenge not yourselves but rather give
[2:18] place unto wrath there we'll go back to
[2:20] the Vengeance there's no there's no
[2:22] vengeance in the Christian yes there's
[2:24] no we don't keep score that's our
[2:30] problem we keep score yes if you do it
[2:32] for me I'll do it for you no you do it
[2:36] for them what the Bible said you do good
[2:37] to an evil person what if you do it
[2:39] heats coals on their head not your heat
[2:42] the cold on their head but brother give
[2:45] place unto wrath for it is written
[2:47] vengeance is mine so let who's mine got
[2:50] some God let God God's gonna take care
[2:53] of the judgment he's gonna take care of
[2:55] the vengeance Bendis his mind I wanted
[2:58] to repay saith the Lord now that's his
[3:00] deal I was like Jason Washington's
[3:03] preaching one Friday night had to do
[3:05] good time he didn't get doing good job
[3:07] that's when he was talking about he said
[3:09] vengeance is mine I will repay leave it
[3:12] to God let him do you know give it to
[3:14] him let him take care of it and did not
[3:18] try to repay a debt or of avenging debt
[3:21] for a debt or whatever morning that was
[3:23] the Old Testament hmm that was your
[3:26] checks and balances and as as he was
[3:30] talking about we are prisoners were
[3:31] prisoners of Christ I was hoping he'd
[3:35] get on that Paul of being a prisoner if
[3:37] somebody else he said the world says
[3:39] loud not a Christian I'm free I can do
[3:41] whatever I want to he said that's deep
[3:43] and he did say the word stupid he said
[3:46] that is just a stupid assumption that
[3:48] you're free and he said but in Christ he
[3:53] said we trade one one one bondage for
[3:55] another because we are free in Christ
[3:59] but run to bondage to him he's our
[4:02] husband we do what he says you know and
[4:05] which is good and then you go to Paul
[4:07] prison or Christ he's finally become a
[4:09] prisoner what the love-affairs like he
[4:11] said he said there's so many billion
[4:13] women in the world he said what they'd
[4:14] won one that I love
[4:16] there's one woman that I submit to that
[4:18] one woman that I'm that I'm with and I
[4:20] said and that's miss you know that's mr.
[4:22] Watkins the narcs just one so that's the
[4:26] way it is with Christ and then one
[4:28] person we submit to and that's cars and
[4:30] we were submissive to him yes it did
[4:38] right he saw your sister that your
[4:43] brother Burdette was there but her
[4:46] husband wasn't there he had to work yeah
[4:48] we got brother Timothy was there and
[4:50] myself and dad mom Jim Lindt
[4:53] brother all up on pain the kid three
[4:57] digs just trying to name the preachers
[5:00] for the whole team where the whole team
[5:02] was there he preached Saturday morning
[5:04] when he get to go Saturday will went
[5:05] Friday night so we supported them on
[5:07] Friday night barley no bigger new don't
[5:12] go off about a month oh yeah yeah I
[5:16] don't much use of little I said you say
[5:17] usko and you hit your ball hitting you
[5:20] can see the ridge yeah we got I don't
[5:26] know you got that okay yeah we did go to
[5:29] the dedication Friday night so it's a
[5:31] good time why do you go out and got me
[5:33] go they're special people
[5:36] don't be so narrow-minded we can't get
[5:37] out Phillip that's right therefore if
[5:39] thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst
[5:42] give him drink for in so deep did I just
[5:46] read that man ago try so doing thou
[5:48] shalt heap coals of fire on his head see
[5:52] here's our problem being people I'm
[5:55] talking about being people we think if
[5:57] we're bad to somebody that's good when
[6:02] you were in the world and you didn't
[6:04] have Christ in your heart getting back
[6:06] at somebody was good don't sit there
[6:09] with your mouth open yeah I guaranteed
[6:10] you did you
[6:12] yeah because you're right and you have a
[6:16] problem with it still now yeah they do
[6:20] it to me I do it to them but being a
[6:23] Christian did you live in a different
[6:26] world but I don't know but I grew up and
[6:29] if somebody did something to me I did my
[6:31] dad level best to get back out yeah
[6:43] there you go
[6:44] they made sure that if he missed one he
[6:46] got one ahead we kept score but we don't
[6:52] keep score anymore that's what Paul's
[6:53] saying we don't keep score anymore
[6:55] if somebody's mean to you the best thing
[6:57] to do is just try to be kind but look
[6:59] for some y'all that came in late Paul
[7:03] said this is not a commandment it's kind
[7:06] of like laughter that's Cal night Friday
[7:08] night we were supposed to start at 7
[7:09] o'clock at church I'm gonna tell it to
[7:11] Burley oberly that way it was 7:00 7:15
[7:14] no barely know you know Jason Watkins
[7:16] already been there for birdie when there
[7:18] he finally comes out not only need over
[7:21] told Jim and Mama said somebody they
[7:23] said 7 o'clock I said that was a
[7:25] suggestion that was a suggestion to be
[7:31] their example the cost kinda like the
[7:32] Ten Commandments are not Commandments
[7:33] anymore they're suggestions ok so Paul
[7:37] says if it be possible then he you know
[7:39] come sometimes he'll say I command G of
[7:41] all men or I command him to do this
[7:42] another word he did say that easy it may
[7:45] be possible as much as what you got
[7:47] inside of you live peaceably with all
[7:49] men because sometimes it can't happen
[7:52] you know as well as I do people cut you
[7:54] off on the road and personal plane
[7:56] another earth or somebody do evil to you
[7:58] there is a little something that raises
[8:00] up that old part of you that's dead but
[8:05] you're still tied to it because of what
[8:08] you were born a car line coming in here
[8:10] is not your solace in this personal
[8:12] by near the the memories and
[8:14] conservation imagination were fighting
[8:16] through the statue a bourbon man right
[8:20] in fact we believe in Jesus I mean you
[8:23] know how much the story goes that he he
[8:26] took time to plant that rope he knew he
[8:29] was plotting his course he was watching
[8:33] them people in that temple and he would
[8:35] send their plane even flat one that's
[8:36] long I don't think right he planted one
[8:39] long enough that we can get to everybody
[8:41] yeah
[8:42] so God himself in human flesh was
[8:43] sitting there braiding the Rope you how
[8:45] long it takes to braid your hair he said
[8:48] they're brave door open when I want to
[8:49] start with that one and I won't if that
[8:54] one's still in here he's going to get it
[8:56] too right I mean really I mean he turned
[9:00] over table he showed a little bit of but
[9:03] you know what you've done he done that
[9:05] because they were in his father's house
[9:06] doing a commandment he knew they knew
[9:08] better than today right okay so but to
[9:12] us to us you know though but the filter
[9:15] of he's not a he's a glorified human now
[9:17] and if you look back on that he'd never
[9:21] do that again
[9:22] never so now he comes back inside of us
[9:25] to try to teach us the same thing to not
[9:28] to do that don't plaque
[9:29] don't let your oak alright and and then
[9:33] if you do if possible if you do have to
[9:35] speak then you know let's just human
[9:37] being but we gotta minimize our mistakes
[9:41] you'll never do away with all your
[9:43] mistakes but you can minimize them you
[9:45] can learn how to correct them and learn
[9:48] how to to control therefore if thine
[9:52] enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give
[9:54] him drink for in so doing thou shalt
[9:56] heap coals of fire on his head
[9:58] be not overcome of evil but overcome
[10:00] evil with good all right continue the
[10:06] thought I'll remember this is chapter
[10:08] thirteen but Paul is continuing his
[10:10] thought man's one to put chapter
[10:11] thirteen than took a break but there's
[10:13] no break in his letter he's writing this
[10:15] letter excuse me
[10:18] let every soul be subject to the higher
[10:20] powers now I want to talk on this just a
[10:22] little bit maybe not today and for those
[10:25] of you that came in a little bit later
[10:27] you know we were talking that says that
[10:31] means governing and that means authority
[10:35] alright
[10:36] it's like we were coming out rather
[10:38] Jason Watkins talking about being under
[10:42] bondage people say you're free in the
[10:45] world now you're under total bondage to
[10:46] the devil but when you become a
[10:48] Christian become in bondage also that's
[10:51] the bondage of blood I'm in a bondage of
[10:54] level of my wife you're in the bottom
[10:55] two level your wife or your husband or
[10:58] wife one bank for but for those of you
[11:02] that came in a little bit later I'm
[11:03] gonna we got only like three chapters
[11:05] left in the book of Romans I had
[11:07] suggested us doing the book of Hebrews
[11:10] but I kind of felt checked the other day
[11:12] to let maybe you suggest to me what's on
[11:15] your heart instead of me just picking
[11:18] the subject makes again you should get
[11:20] some English from your heart
[11:22] sister Johnny said the nine spirit to
[11:23] speak on a non spiritual gift sister
[11:25] have a canard said go ahead and start in
[11:26] Hebrews and indeed Hebrews is rich
[11:28] really but if there's a general question
[11:31] for somebody else we need to do we need
[11:33] to take that under consideration so you
[11:36] think about it we've got about probably
[11:37] three four more weeks we'll get into
[11:40] probably March and we'll start on
[11:44] whatever you want start on so y'all just
[11:45] kind of discuss it among yourself I'll
[11:47] take that into consideration we'll take
[11:49] that in consideration anybody else
[11:50] that's something else and then what
[11:52] we'll do is well do like they're doing
[11:53] to ministers me
[11:55] ministers meeting there's twenty
[11:57] ministers and they they will let wants
[11:58] to top it for next time when one says
[12:00] well let's talk alone me Burke one says
[12:01] let's talk me and I'm saying two weeks
[12:03] well then say that this or that well we
[12:07] broke Tim Rice them down and they we
[12:09] vote so you have a hand vote and whoever
[12:12] wins that's the subject we pick first
[12:13] and we drop the next subject down to the
[12:15] next okay so we don't do away with that
[12:19] if he bruised is voted on then we'll do
[12:22] nine spiritual gifts after that so it'll
[12:24] be the will of people okay and then you
[12:26] pray it let it be the will of God inside
[12:28] you to speak you know right but let's
[12:31] talk about it for me let every soul be
[12:32] subject
[12:34] when to the higher powers that's like
[12:36] what brother Jason was talking about to
[12:38] Friday
[12:39] Paul was a prisoner to Christ he thought
[12:42] he was free when he was putting them
[12:44] Christians in them in the in jail right
[12:48] but he wasn't he was in bondage to Satan
[12:51] because God wasn't causing him to do
[12:53] that Satan was causing him to do that
[12:55] but then he turns around and then he
[12:57] says Paul a prisoner of Christ now he
[13:01] now is a prisoner a love slave
[13:04] whatever you want to call it it is it's
[13:06] a love affair so love slave like those
[13:09] of you who weren't here Jason's brother
[13:10] Jason did a good job talking about this
[13:12] he said there's a there's almost one
[13:14] point two point something big and women
[13:17] in the world he said but I only got one
[13:19] woman that I'm subject to that's mrs. or
[13:24] sister watch mr. Watkins his wife he
[13:26] said I only got wanted to worry about
[13:27] its that same way with God dog may have
[13:30] had different one he had a wife he had a
[13:31] Jewish wife remember what we've been
[13:33] talking about it's damn right well he
[13:35] hadn't put her away how you put the
[13:36] denomination's away but he's got one
[13:37] wife and then they're subject to each
[13:40] other alright but we know one thing's
[13:42] for sure how are you going to be over
[13:45] and over subject to the Creator you
[13:48] can't you can't control what the Creator
[13:51] does right amen yes that was another
[13:54] good point he was making he used me and
[13:56] dad as an example he said there's not
[13:59] one thing brother Wade can do for being
[14:02] brother sambel son nothing nothing
[14:06] people fight stuff all the time you know
[14:08] and I don't find it well no I'm not my
[14:10] daddy
[14:10] well yeah it you can't deny that let's
[14:13] do you anything God your Creator God's
[14:16] the one that lives inside of you these
[14:17] want to give you the new birth so he is
[14:19] the higher power because don't fear the
[14:22] man that can kill the body fear the man
[14:25] that can kill the soul there's only one
[14:27] person in the whole universe
[14:30] they can kill your soul and that's done
[14:32] but he can't kill his own soul that's it
[14:36] he cannot kill himself so if you are him
[14:42] that was the whole point if she is him
[14:44] if you're him he can't give you that's
[14:46] mine you going around are you you take a
[14:49] death or take a body changing either one
[14:51] you're alive more than you've ever been
[14:53] alive in your life you're alive now
[14:55] that's right but you're our prisoner
[14:58] Christ we didn't throw this thing away
[15:00] we still live by but we become it that
[15:07] Weiser written it's written epistle this
[15:09] word now is walking on two feet yes but
[15:12] there still has to be a higher power we
[15:14] have to have just as the wife should be
[15:18] subject to the husband and we'll go back
[15:20] to what Paul says if it possible you all
[15:27] get that demand that the Bible says as
[15:32] the husband treats a wife and wife
[15:33] treated her the same way with Christ in
[15:35] the church
[15:35] yeah so if you're not submissive to your
[15:37] husband now that don't go to meat and
[15:40] then everything else but if you're not
[15:41] submissive to your husband and keep your
[15:43] mouth shut when you supposed to sisters
[15:45] I'm sorry same way with us if we don't
[15:47] keep our mouths shut then God's gonna go
[15:49] shut your mouth
[15:51] we must be subject to the higher power
[15:54] because as we treat our wife God don't
[15:56] treat us that's what the Bible said all
[15:58] right hey that's one we have one problem
[16:00] food we're not submissive enough all
[16:03] right but look there is no power but of
[16:06] God Satan has no power right you know
[16:11] what the power comes from see that
[16:13] that's authority the power to create is
[16:18] only in God that's see to me that's the
[16:23] ultimate power you can you can have
[16:25] billions of worlds but if you don't have
[16:28] a living soul on it it's worthless
[16:30] yeah but the higher power is is that God
[16:33] created the soul we become like this
[16:35] coming home Friday about nature and and
[16:40] the things of nature there's a natural
[16:43] occurrence that goes on in nature but
[16:46] it's god it's god it's his nature when
[16:50] we see this name next
[16:51] it's nature no like I was talking to
[16:55] girl cutting my hair that was
[16:57] coming to Dean a hairdresser and the
[17:02] answered the phone she said beauty shop
[17:03] I said you live may be beautiful in 30
[17:08] years no but she was talking about she
[17:18] was talking about them how the natural
[17:20] world's going storms and only stuff you
[17:23] see I said well now God give us this
[17:27] nature nature I mean out there you know
[17:30] animals and plants and stuff and they do
[17:32] their thing but what about something so
[17:35] important that God put a soul in a man
[17:37] to give them a god-like quality and
[17:40] that's what you have even the center has
[17:42] that godlike quality look we change
[17:45] things a bird builds and that's the same
[17:47] way brother I'm talking about that but
[17:48] if we if we keep building our houses the
[17:51] same way they just be the you know the
[17:52] little cookie cutter houses and but and
[17:54] what we advance
[17:55] as we advance we are those gods and God
[17:59] give us that power because we're on the
[18:01] earth he said here you take care of the
[18:02] earth I'll take care of heaven that's
[18:04] what he told Adam what happened was even
[18:06] though even in a fallen condition man
[18:08] still has power you have power to go to
[18:11] heaven or hell that power lies in you
[18:15] that's your decision
[18:17] God don't decide her he would be a
[18:19] respect for persons and it would be sure
[18:21] enough predestination stamped like this
[18:23] no no your free moral agent to me from
[18:27] relation is probably the second highest
[18:29] power from creation because you decide
[18:34] god gives you the decision but now then
[18:37] we'll let's come back to us being little
[18:39] creators we are all creative programs
[18:43] that you walk in a room you can create
[18:44] an atmosphere that was not there before
[18:47] right you've created it if you weren't
[18:49] in that room it wouldn't be created you
[18:51] created that atmosphere all right so we
[18:54] are a little created but Allah gods give
[18:56] us power he's give us he gave us all
[19:00] power but he still the higher power
[19:03] even Satan has to ask God for permission
[19:07] to do things you know that he had asked
[19:09] permission to talk to you and get around
[19:12] Joe and what did God do now Satan would
[19:14] have been all-powerful he said well I'm
[19:16] just gonna kill him today and I'm done
[19:17] with it
[19:18] that's what identifies the devil I said
[19:20] 10 seconds from now he's gonna be dead
[19:24] but God said do anything you want to I
[19:27] can't take his life its life is mine I
[19:32] decide whether he lives or dies you
[19:35] don't decide whether he lives or dies
[19:36] all right so that's the higher power to
[19:39] me that creation is the higher power
[19:41] mm-hmm and who is the creator the Holy
[19:45] Ghost is the creator all that all that
[19:48] time together but the Holy Ghost is one
[19:50] that speaks the power to give you an
[19:53] hour hour and if you got the Holy Ghost
[19:54] that's my brother said you got the Holy
[19:57] Ghost you got what power to create a
[19:59] world and go live on it that's it all
[20:02] right but that's the power he'd give us
[20:05] because he gave us the Holy Ghost for
[20:08] there is no power but of God so there is
[20:10] no other you still all Satan's got this
[20:12] I kind of want to cover something after
[20:14] them maybe if I get into it about the
[20:17] two powers that we're talking about even
[20:19] in the seals you're talking about two
[20:20] powers there's only two brother brown
[20:24] said you're not a halfway Christian
[20:26] right you're either a you're either on
[20:27] this side or this side
[20:29] your soul is either faith or doubt
[20:31] there's no in-between so there's only
[20:33] and but there's only one power God
[20:36] permitted Satan power to do and what to
[20:39] Satan do he took his free moral agency
[20:41] and turned it into iniquity turned it
[20:43] into hideous sin and all these things
[20:46] that he does the powers that be are
[20:50] ordained of God
[20:51] well right with that there are danger
[20:54] God are there appointed by God he did
[20:57] give Satan power you're going on a chair
[21:01] might give you the anointing I give you
[21:03] what the word your the worship angel
[21:05] your to do this your to do that and what
[21:07] do you do he turned it to iniquity
[21:11] that's great because you got to you got
[21:14] to beings or you got two ways of going
[21:18] you literally have to reject God's power
[21:22] to go to hell you have to literally
[21:25] reject God to be fallen literally you
[21:29] have cuz that's what's gonna happen in
[21:30] judgement cars gonna stand there he said
[21:32] I give you everything you need it and on
[21:35] this day right here you turn me down
[21:37] amen
[21:38] and I know by my infinite wisdom
[21:41] if I come to you every day for the rest
[21:44] of your life you'd have never done the
[21:45] same thing see that's what helped me
[21:47] with predestination and people I ate off
[21:49] Hitler and all that work brother
[21:50] groundhogs buddy couldn't be saved
[21:52] hey well it never became in God's mind
[21:56] he can never be saved but he had to give
[21:58] him a choice down here and by that
[22:01] choice God said Wells cuz cuz I knew one
[22:03] thing's for sure if he'd give Adolf
[22:05] Hitler a million years by His infinite
[22:06] wisdom he knew Adolf Hitler would never
[22:09] come to the knowledge of God so
[22:11] therefore he could let him live his life
[22:13] commit suicide be done he gone all right
[22:15] same way with anybody else in the world
[22:18] same way because that answers a lot of
[22:21] questions when we say what why did that
[22:23] why did this why why did he allow but
[22:28] you know what the worst power that you
[22:29] can prover
[22:30] is a religious power Eichmann and Hitler
[22:35] naturally killed six million Jews but
[22:39] the Roman Catholic Church brother Brown
[22:40] says the Roman Catholic Church by the
[22:42] crease in dogmas which goes into the
[22:44] Baptists and Methodists and all that has
[22:46] killed billions spiritually
[22:50] so that's works to me to be spiritually
[22:53] then than to be naturally dead but they
[22:56] still took the power gone for her
[22:58] because there's no power of Satan that's
[23:00] right yes whosoever therefore resisteth
[23:04] the power resisteth the ordinance of God
[23:08] so in other words you resist the power
[23:10] of God now let's flip that around resist
[23:13] the devil and he'll free flee from you
[23:15] so you resist that part of power that
[23:18] God give to Satan you resist that and
[23:20] you're fine but don't resist the power
[23:22] of God
[23:23] resisting the ordinance of God and they
[23:25] that resist shall receive to themselves
[23:28] damnation so
[23:30] so whose choice is it theirs they
[23:34] resisted you as a spiritual a soul being
[23:40] your soul God give you that's all
[23:44] Injection do good jumble friday to about
[23:47] he says that all nature was attached to
[23:49] your to you when you were born that old
[23:51] Adamic nature and that had to die the
[23:53] soul didn't die
[23:54] the older damning nature had to die so
[23:57] that Christ could come in co-starred
[24:00] with therefore resisteth the power
[24:01] resisteth ordinance of God and they that
[24:03] resist shall receive to them domination
[24:05] for rulers are not a terror to good
[24:08] works but to evil rulers well they'll
[24:12] then not be afraid of the power well do
[24:17] that which is good and you shall have
[24:19] praise of the same in other words
[24:21] they're not gonna get they're gonna get
[24:23] praised for the terror they're gonna get
[24:24] evil praise in other words made off that
[24:27] little people I say off Hitler because
[24:30] probably that would be to me the epitome
[24:32] of evil it's having six million people
[24:34] killed but I'm sure these people have
[24:36] more people killed than that down to the
[24:37] dark ages
[24:38] we just got an updated history the guy a
[24:42] new movie out about that last one
[24:45] Eichmann where the Messiah found him in
[24:47] Brazil or wherever it was Costa Rica and
[24:50] put him on trial my sixties in brother
[24:52] Graham speaks of that they were part of
[24:55] the Nuremberg trial now the Nuremberg
[24:56] trial is when all the generals and the
[24:58] little peons that fulfill the request to
[25:02] kill them they all got executed back in
[25:04] the late 40s yeah bout 48 don't like
[25:07] that 49 probably was know as 47 it was
[25:11] right after the work but they couldn't
[25:13] catch the big generals till they had
[25:14] enough money to dispersed herself we
[25:15] didn't have work about Hitler that he
[25:17] killed himself
[25:18] but Eichmann in Mandalay they went to a
[25:20] different country but you bet the Mossad
[25:23] founder but that guy you know what he
[25:26] was over when they found him through the
[25:27] doctor yeah he kept the same profession
[25:35] but when he got out from under that evil
[25:38] of Hitler I haven't helped people that
[25:43] was the whole paradox of the thing he
[25:44] became a doctor he had become a doctor
[25:46] of death he became a doctor tried to
[25:48] help the people whatever community was
[25:50] any became an outstanding doctor they
[25:52] couldn't believe that he was who that
[25:53] guy was you know but when he done he
[25:55] came out from under that power of Hitler
[25:58] but still they never repented so they
[26:02] did to him what they should have done no
[26:06] dude that was just good thou shalt have
[26:08] praise for the saint for he is the
[26:10] minister of God to thee for good but if
[26:14] thou do that which is evil be afraid for
[26:16] he beareth not the sword in vain for he
[26:20] is the minister of God a revenger to
[26:22] execute wrath upon him that doeth evil
[26:28] an Avenger or a revenger to execute
[26:32] wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore
[26:35] ye must needs to be subject not only for
[26:38] the wrath but also for conscience take
[26:40] name somebody whose that he Christ a
[26:42] higher power the Holy Ghost the Holy
[26:45] Ghost ruh somebody
[26:48] amen
[26:51] listen there's a real fine line and you
[26:54] brothers and sisters know this being all
[26:55] being married for some length of time
[26:57] there is no real fine line between
[26:59] anarchy and being a love slave there's
[27:03] that blue demands down with no man you
[27:06] can be I'm the ruler you cook me
[27:08] breakfast you get up it
[27:10] wellnow o'clock in the morning you get
[27:13] up not around me really that's rulership
[27:16] that's not what that is nobody if you do
[27:20] it out of love then it turns everything
[27:22] around nice so there is there's a fine
[27:25] line there and see because the world
[27:27] looks at us the way we dress and the way
[27:30] we do now what does the world say about
[27:32] you all yours you're suppressed you're
[27:35] under bondage you you have
[27:37] I'll cut your hair you have to do that
[27:40] you have to wear your skirt sisters you
[27:42] you men you don't you can't drink and
[27:45] you can't smoke and you can't cook see
[27:47] what they said they're saying we're so
[27:49] depressed and suppressed under they just
[27:51] don't know that if they got the baptism
[27:54] of the Holy Ghost in their soul they'd
[27:56] come to this right here and be the
[27:57] happiest people in the world we should
[27:58] be the happiest people in the place the
[27:59] earth
[28:00] okay then we are free but we're free
[28:02] while we're still under the higher power
[28:04] yes yes because the Bible says we have
[28:09] Liberty in Christ but I think doesn't
[28:11] mean we overshoot Christ can we shooting
[28:14] down and say oh let's not I do what I
[28:16] want them now sometimes we do that yeah
[28:19] because we do do what we want to but you
[28:21] know what he's just said right here you
[28:23] get a little up you get a little smack
[28:25] on the hand right wherefore you must
[28:28] need to be subject not only for wrath
[28:29] but also for conscience sake for for for
[28:37] for for for this cause pay tribute also
[28:40] now what is tribute taxes the guy time
[28:53] not so much money but time give your
[28:55] time give your tribute to God for they
[28:58] are God's ministers attending
[29:00] continually upon this very thing
[29:02] now once God's ministers he's talking
[29:04] about he is interlaced and hearing
[29:06] brought down apostles prophets pastors
[29:10] teachers in evangelist the fivefold
[29:12] ministry is the head of the body of
[29:14] Christ God is the head he filters
[29:18] through the FIFO ministry out to the
[29:21] subjects on her out to us but we're not
[29:25] as a minister I don't stand back and say
[29:27] well now I'm part of fivefold ministry
[29:28] and all y'all are out there no listen
[29:33] when there's a preacher in the pulpit I
[29:34] miss subject as you are yes to the
[29:37] higher power I don't set myself aside
[29:39] and put my fans in my ear to say well I
[29:41] don't have to listen so is the preacher
[29:44] when I listen a preacher like brother
[29:45] Jason said he said that's a good point
[29:47] he said he said God's here he said I
[29:50] showed up to help him right I mean he's
[29:54] gonna use Maine Easter but he said God's
[29:56] here he said you guys never left he said
[29:58] I'm just standing it I just move into a
[30:00] position where God can speak through me
[30:01] excited to showed up don't start talking
[30:04] and that's trades if he's a god call man
[30:06] I say thank so what happened what
[30:08] happened it did nothing for for for this
[30:13] cause pay tribute also for their gods
[30:15] ministers attending continually upon
[30:17] this very thing render therefore to all
[30:22] their dudes tribute to them tribute is
[30:25] due custom to whom custom fear to whom
[30:29] fear honor to whom honor because look
[30:34] herein lies our problem hearing lies all
[30:40] of our problem what brother Dale's
[30:42] always said what you consider you do is
[30:47] right but if since Johnny don't do what
[30:51] I do she's wrong now that's prevalent in
[30:54] this room ok I'm looking at all of you
[30:58] that's prevalent in this room if you do
[31:00] it the way I say it it's fine if you
[31:03] don't do it you're wrong that's not true
[31:05] you render custom to whom custom we
[31:07] don't go overseas and say look let's
[31:09] thought y'all will need to eat them
[31:10] you're not you're not supposed to you
[31:12] you're not an American yeah custom
[31:16] custom did you know couple likes and
[31:20] dislikes and stuff but if I have a
[31:23] custom what did Paul say if it's custom
[31:26] that you don't that they don't eat me

[31:29] vegetarian what do you say they give
[31:32] that steak he said each or steak at home
[31:37] don't don't say I may eat when I want to
[31:41] in front you know have a little respect
[31:43] custom for custom now they stop custom
[31:46] that you like I'm sure y'all show it but
[31:51] in the Philippines like the blue you
[31:53] know trend you know you stuff like that
[31:55] that's stealing I'm talking about in
[31:58] general alright in general it's like it
[32:02] if you
[32:02] go to Carl's house you take your shoes
[32:05] off what is that that's the custom yeah
[32:08] so we take our shoes off preachers all
[32:11] the way down so everybody take their
[32:13] shoes off kind of funny to look around
[32:15] you see boy you better wear a good sauce
[32:18] here you go that I look down the one
[32:22] with it Oh Josiah what's that gonna

[32:35] sticking out like this you know the good
[32:40] side of that that's great shots or what
[32:42] is it you go no but that's a custom that
[32:45] you need to respect it always back your
[32:48] respect let somebody don't like the
[32:51] color blue they're not centered okay you
[32:56] don't like to do so and so as long as
[32:58] you stay under the higher power now if
[33:01] you sit in that congregation up here
[33:05] listening to the Word of God and you
[33:07] turned it down little different ballgame

[33:16] black guy Lee Lee singing from Bella
[33:18] Burley I miss guys like six seven he's
[33:20] got hands about that big I thought if he
[33:22] ever raised his hand in our sanctuary
[33:24] upstairs he kept see what I was thinking

[33:29] when he put that hand up it looks like
[33:30] it goes like 12 feet you know I've been
[33:33] going like that but custom to whom
[33:37] custom fear to whom fear you know Paul
[33:42] picks up and says there's time to cry
[33:44] cry with them you know cry with them
[33:47] pray with them
[33:49] we like to condemn them know you need to
[33:51] kind of enter in that's right
[33:54] help them out like my new saying is this
[33:59] year I've got new year's resolution it
[34:01] ain't none of my business if you don't
[34:03] ask me to help you with something you
[34:05] ain't none of my business now if you ask
[34:07] me it becomes part of my business but if
[34:09] they don't any no my bed
[34:10] I really it's not I don't care but you
[34:13] got a problem and I got a problem I need
[34:15] to enter mine and you need to take care
[34:17] of yours now if you want to bust enter
[34:18] in together that's okay that means
[34:20] you've asked but other than that ain't
[34:22] into this gossip jump on some y'all are
[34:24] I'm not gonna gossip I forget that
[34:27] business that's all I hear sometimes
[34:28] fear to whom fear honor to him honor we
[34:32] need to honor the office remember we
[34:34] honor the office and if that man's in an
[34:37] office doing a good job you need to
[34:39] honor that man too because he's in that
[34:41] office we honor brother Dale comes the
[34:43] past you say well I don't want come he
[34:45] says irregardless which is not even
[34:47] worth well it so what Big D that's what
[34:49] I mean I know my baby just listen to
[34:52] what he's saying but the honor is the
[34:55] place the pastor man he spent a long
[34:56] time and I looked at him the other day
[34:58] that something man saving almost seventy
[35:01] nine years old he's been doing this he
[35:02] told me though they said you've been
[35:04] listening to message for 50 years
[35:10] because I was eight when we came in the
[35:12] message 1960s when he looked over reason
[35:15] you may listen to it for 50 years I have
[35:18] been doing it for 50 years there was a
[35:20] gap in there that I did my own thing you
[35:22] know that since I was eight years old I
[35:25] have heard the prophets voice that's
[35:28] been 50 I'm 58 I'll be 59 in a few weeks
[35:31] Danny we're 26 but but you don't realize
[35:36] that though there for 50 years even
[35:39] somebody not as young as me it has been
[35:42] hearing the prophets message to Lois a
[35:44] mr. Dave you've heard this thing he said
[35:46] you heard it as long as I that's why I
[35:48] didn't stay in it as long as he a white
[35:50] man me until you know in the night late
[35:52] 90 so but you got to pray for them pray
[35:56] for I'll pray for every by an office the
[35:58] Satan would love to kill everybody
[35:59] just give her them like yes you're
[36:01] everywhere it's down in the car
[36:03] Honduras I would mention no until every
[36:06] time I preach I've mentioned hey
[36:07] greetings from my church at home
[36:09] I said brothers brother Dale was you
[36:12] know comin in finesse it seems like 67
[36:15] 68 or whatever I said is the same thing
[36:18] that he preached back then is the same
[36:20] thing he's preaching now I tried many
[36:21] times you'd receive like clapping I know
[36:24] well was just a few yeah I hear the
[36:28] earth they hear that they and then
[36:29] that's one of the reason you watch you
[36:30] know so sure me they don't even know the
[36:32] man that they were third they're quiet
[36:33] about you know what they're honoring the
[36:35] office and Amanda send the officers in
[36:37] the office you just like I said about
[36:39] the higher power
[36:40] we are sheep we have two best my point
[36:44] then we'll stop right there stop right
[36:46] here alright but that's my whole point
[36:51] we are all sheep when I'm preaching I'm
[36:57] still a sheep to God God's the head the
[37:02] head Shepherd I haven't pulled myself
[37:05] out and set myself apart and well you
[37:08] know you beat the you know
[37:11] I'll get baked its leadership yes it's
[37:14] all come down to leadership and and we
[37:17] are sheep we all have to be led that's
[37:20] just it that's in the Bible that's in
[37:23] the prophets message we have to be led
[37:26] right now and for led by the Spirit of
[37:29] God through a man standing in the pulpit
[37:31] then god bless the man okay Sam like
[37:35] people my brother Carol man a you know

[37:47] believe what do you look toward means
[37:48] that you've been hearing this for 50
[37:49] years but you don't realize that look
[37:52] some of you even sent even just say
[37:54] since 98 when I came back to the Lord

[38:50] be sticky Brown see this thing right
[38:52] here is gonna be sticking to the chain
[38:53] yes you're gonna be sticky but there's
[38:56] somebody like brother Jason seven go

[38:59] he said there's somebody again and he
[39:01] reached Tracy said they somebody getting
[39:03] this and lemon buddy alright so and
[39:06] that's why you keep preaching cuz if you
[39:08] preach then never saw everybody's uh you
[39:11] know I mean get depressed sometimes when
[39:16] you preaching your heart out and people
[39:17] are sleeping for you know yeah 20
[39:20] minutes at a time so does that mean they
[39:23] got it off you ladies gonna take him out

[39:26] got it myself you can't have that
[39:28] attitude we are sheep we've got to be
[39:32] led by somebody if you think you're the
[39:35] shepherd Synar yeah I mean really if you
[39:42] think you're the shepherd we have one
[39:45] head Shepherd Jesus Christ and now he's
[39:49] in the form of the Holy Ghost which is
[39:53] Jesus Christ in another form but where
[39:55] is he he's in you now he's working
[39:58] through your body and every level of
[40:01] idiosyncracies secret sees that we have
[40:08] that's unless you make it part of it but
