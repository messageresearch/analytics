========================================

let's turn into Ephesians the fifth chapter you're going to read verses 1 through 14. you know I was thinking this morning you know sometimes we we have enemies that we fight with us you know do like Jesus did best way to get even with your enemy is forgive them for what they did to you and if you can do that you conquered the enemy that's what it did when he's on carry he said father forgive them amen so let us just be like he was remember the same thing Ephesians 5 1 through 14. let's pray Heavenly Father we are grateful this morning Lord we're thankful for this privilege and opportunity God that you have given unto us father let us have love love one to another and all things that we do Lord let us remember our enemies and pray for them give them Lord we ask you just to make their hearts right Lord and then they'll no longer be our enemies but our friends God and we thank you for all things wherever we are let us keep you in mind let us fall in the footsteps that you have left for us and we love you remember brother Dallas morning Father and just bless him as he prays and meditates for us Lord remember those that in the Sunday School classes Lord just bless them all together in Jesus Christ and we pray amen Ephesians 5. be ye therefore fathers of God as dear children but fornication and online cleanliness covenants let it not be once named among you as we cometh Saints for this you know that no home homeowners not unclean person not cover this man nor who is an adulterer who has inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God but because of these things come of the wrath of God upon all the children of disobedience being be not ye therefore partake us with them for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and Truth the Lord and have no fellowship with the Unfaithful workers of Darkness but rather reprove them but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doeth make manifest is light oh he says awake thou that sleepeth and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee lights amen God bless you maybe see this foreign was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said he shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for God doesn't know that in the day you eat you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as God's knowing Good and Evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit to her of and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat in the eyes of them both were opened and they knew they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cooler today hmm and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him or art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked as thou eat another tree orof I commanded that thou shouldest not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said this serpents beguiled me and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy bellish yet thy go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thy shalt bring for children and thy husband excuse me and I shall bring forth nice conception in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou Hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hath eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of the life then he goes on Thorns thistles and things all right because of what happened in the garden so you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now you'll see immediately that we're going to be dealing with uh the fall of Man and the uh things in relation we're not going to try to spend much time in proving a lot of things uh because I think that you and I should be far enough along to be able to understand and we can just State something and go on you know without having to explain it now to those that are on internet uh we have people out there that you know count this star their Church home I guess because they send their tithe but to the rest of you out there now this is to this church only you can listen in all you want to but remember don't call me to want to know the answer to a lot of questions you've done been told you go to your pastor or you go to brother Branham you know and whatever you do then do that because I'm not going to be an answer of questions because this day will be kind of a little uh into a point of something that I've been thinking on for quite a while but I believe it will open up a lot of things unto us if we'll listen but you'll try your best to figure out what I'm talking about before I say it and that's going to be a great hindrance to you and you will lock in and say well I believe this well that's all right that's your believing that's your choice but only do the only thing I do is ask you to listen you know as to what I'm speaking about and then uh you know go home pray about it uh you know come to me now of course I know what you'll do you'll go to everybody else and you'll you can't come on yourself about you know what things are that you don't agree with but just remember that Schism in the body and you'll answer to God you remember the message the other day called the church to bitterly fail all it takes is a little Yakety Yak among the people it won't come to me and talk about it you owe it to me first right right and see that Schism in the body so you'll answer to God you know I'm honest I'm just straight what would you do if you were up here you know and like I said what would you do if you was if you was up your ministering and you're having to preach to people then you're sitting there and going and every once in a while I might get a little just a tiny bit of an odd and brother Donnie Reagan said one time a little nod is a big amen you know you you didn't all right but that's your choice because you're going to do what you want to all right but just remember your warrant right you owe it to me first you went to me first then all right because we're going to get into something that's going to be surprisingly in a little bit and now I'm telling you up front now so here's up front now we will be staying only we will read quotes that apply but we will be staying only in the Old Testament nobody understand it only in the Old Testament in the types the shatters ETC because we got to get those things out of the way before we can understand and doing that then we can can leave it so everybody understand me now keep your thoughts in the Old Testament don't run over what I've got that you know you're uh you're where do we get there it might be a surprise when we get there all right you might be surprised all right now we know what happened in the Garden of Eden and how did it brought death upon the whole human race all right we do not believe that Eve ate an apple are some form of fruit all right because she said the serpent beguiled me or defiled me right and they made aprons to cover their body parts not to cover their uh mouth as a eating an apple they covered their Parts all right so that lets us know what was there and what took place we also know as we read in Genesis 1 that it says the serpent is the most subtle of all beasts we know that's impossible to be both at the same time all right so first he was a beast all right an upright creature the point between uh the monkey and the Man In Darwin's theory all right and then he was made a snake serpent by the curse that was put on him off your your legs would go off you'll go to your belly you'll crawl you'll be a snake you know in other words a serpent all right now we know that they can't take those animals and they've surely tried to take the snake and made it back with the human race because God destroyed that so much until what he done he took that beast and he put him into the uh there was already snakes in the garden because you'd have to go by the species you know uh you know if you're going to believe in Creative Evolution you would go into all the animals would be created and they would have been snakes there but what he done he put it into the snake part so that would destroy the relationship to mankind as to be able to you know reproduce in any form between the snake and the the uh to mankind all right now we know that it was not fruit but we know that you are the fruit of your mother and your father that's what you are you're the fruit of your mother and father You're The Offspring the fruit of coming forth all right now I'm going to ask you because I've asked a few a little question I like to do that ahead of time you know and let you think about it I mentioned it a couple of times once I know from the pulpit but now we know that Eve had whatever you want to call it an affair uh with the Beast all right and then with Adam all right now the prophet says in the morning with the beast in the evening something like that something to the degree and he said as long as it's within a 24-hour period it can happen that you can have multiple partners and have children from you know different ones uh you know like that away all right but now what I want you to think about it will help us now I I've got a little sense I hope not much but I want you to think about this as Eve having two partners right now I want you to think about is Eve having two husbands all right now uh what was wrong with the little woman at the well she had too many husbands now she might have married all of them but was it necessary that she was married to all of them or or you know in other words go down to courthouse get to do this to do that you know the marriage see when we think of husband and wife we think of getting the the papers and signing them and writing them out you know and uh but I want you in your mind to think because it will help if I use the word husband and and I'll I'll try not in my mind to use that as much as using to Partners all right and in doing that I want to ask you a question you know she had two partners all right there's not a word for that in you know there is but I mean it's not the basics of words that we use they got the fancy words today but we talk about uh you know too many partners and knowing that that happened all right well then the question I ask is why was polygamy introduced and I know I know the word polygamy I've got it written down here's the definition it's really a dual type of word because Webster says polygamy is the practice or condition of having many or several spouses especially wives at one time all right so polygamy is basically used in our thoughts about a man with more than one wife but polygamy is can be used as a wife with too many husbands do you understand that's Webster's definition It's The Habit of mating with one meeting with more than one of the opposite sex all right so that's the definition of polygamy see you'd like to use for a man as you know for the woman has too many husbands one type of a word and a man for too many wives is polygamy and and but it you won't get it because even if you go to bigamy you know to try to Define it bigger means the crime of marrying while one has a legal wife or husband still living all right that's just what you call the word bigamy so we have to stay with the point of understanding that what happened in the garden was Eve had too many Partners husbands all right and we can't argue that point because we know that it's true right we shouldn't know that much about the what we call the seed of the serpent the things you know surely by now all right but why was polygamy introduced because that would be then we would Define the word now with the Bible form of polygamy the Bible form of the word polygamy would mean one male many females right the Bible form now we've established because it would not be you could use the word interchangeably but between Eve and the Beast and Adam would not have been called polygamy all right because that would mean she had too many husbands all right but why was it introduced that polygamy would come in to be my question is would polygamy take away sin I mean is this a story let's get it right because we'll make a movie out of it all right you know that's what they do today right so if Eve had too many partners did God get mad at her and say okie dokie you went your way and I'll go my way and I'll make you to be under your husband and you won't be allowed to have more than one but he can have more than one is that the curse and is it that polygamy would take away sin no in order to know better than that right man so now if you miss anything that I'm trying to bring remember that's the point that Eve had too many Partners husbands but then all at once polygamy is a lot all right and not only in the human race polygamy comes involved into the animal race right why is that well brother Dale you you yeah I try to make you think I'm sorry but that's just my way of preaching all right but see you get to think in the wrong way and you're going to cut off everything I say that's why I said to start with follow me on the bus go into like one brother said I didn't read my Bible anytime I want to listen go ahead but you sit there and write notes you can't write a whole lot of words and keep up with what I'm saying so jot it down in a hurry all right and connect back that's why I repeat a lot of things because I know what you do now you tell me you can write and and listen to what I'm saying you know you're none of your speed writers you know what I mean you're not people that can sit and type you know while somebody's talking that takes a special person to me so I know where none of us in that category you calling us dummies yeah you remember the guy the other day got in trouble you know a few weeks ago he got in trouble for saying you know Obamacare reason we didn't do it we're all stupid the boy they letting him have it so I guess you can let me have it but now there's a couple of items we've got to cover the word you won't go into the wrong category but I'm asking a simple question why was polygamy introduced all right wood polygamy take away the sin of Eve I don't think so now but to make sure you don't go into the wrong Channel with me on it I'll put this on here and it will be on other messages because I want you to know for sure we don't believe in polygamy all right now there's a plenty of people in the message that do you know I mean there's plenty of them dire in there but that's their business it ain't up to us in Lula ain't up to us to straighten them out just up to us to go in a Rapture and let them worry about their problems right all right but look what your Prophet has to say 1956 129 into Supernatural he's talking about polygamy and he said really that a nation that was in polygamy would really be better off he said because if you look in there see because we try to make the men of the world outside coincide with Christian doctrine all right he said polygamy would be better than because we make or try to make see people line up with Christian doctrine he said that's the reason we're in the mess we're in misinterpreted theology is that true but look what he gets down the site now remember don't you say that I believe in polygamy I don't all right we'll get to that in a minute but we want to get another one this is off the serp the 70th week of Daniel 1961 806. go ahead to 1B if the nations were they have polygamy in the Nations where they have polygamy it's a thousand times better and yet polygamy is wrong we know now get the point don't try to figure out all of what he's going through the uh the thing just get the point that in the countries where polygamy is legal you don't have as much problems as you do in America where it's just rampant on both sides right now that's what he's talking about so don't get involved in that get in what he's saying polygamy is not right now this is the point I said we want to stay in the Old Testament but here's the point when you come to the New Testament you come to man and wife which is supposed to be back like the original that Jesus said in the beginning it wasn't so that there was just one male one female all right so we're in the New Testament where polygamy would be wrong there is a little something there that we must deal with but yet keep in your mind what we're talking about because we're not in the tops anymore all right you can say well this this happened because of this and get the time that's good that's fine but I still asked a simple question polygamy can only type right no you can't take polygamy and do away with sin of guard in the garden that wouldn't be it in other words you say to the woman okay you've done what you've done so now you had two partners so we're going to take away your two and say you can't ever have but one but we're going to give your hubby the right to have as many as he wants remember we're still in the Old Testament type right all right but what I want you to think of would that polygamy how would it do away with sin and be done all right well we've come to the New Testament point of showing us that that we don't believe in polygamy it was legal in the Old Testament right how would you like to be an apostle Paul and brother Brian said he gave her grace how would you like to have been him going over to them in the Corinthians that's where he had the trouble and our sense of God with 10 wives and he's trying to be a Christian in the New Testament to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost what are you going to do with him I like what brother Theo harassments them done over there in Africa when they found those people just living together in the grounds and didn't know whose daddy who was what because they just you know living in a way they went out there and said okie dokie we start right here now pick out which one's yours and you're going home with that one wife because you can't do that in the New Testament and say polygamy is okay because you're already finished your top your body understand me we're not typing Christ in the church on the death Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came that was Christ in the church sure there's a reason that that body is a mini-membered body yes but just remember each one of us remember under the Old Testament taught he could have more than one wife but she could never have but one husband now we'll get to it we've got it there were if her husband be dead she's free to marry but only in the Lord so we'll get to that all right but I want you to think with me while you're under the types what was taking place that says that but let's just read let's read around them where you won't think I've got something on my own some of you people never read marriage in divorce and you'd be surprised how long you can get out and talk to people well I never read that message but they know how to explain it right or they can explain it to you to the detail and never read the message within the Daniel 70 week series with the brothers did you know all about it but you don't even have a copy of the drawing you know but isn't that something look what he says let's go to this one he's taken off a marriage and divorce paragraph 202 203 look what the prophet said you see after the beginning it was something else was introduced and this is going to shock you I heard you tired going to know just sit still just a little longer then the double Covenant was made by man and woman now do you understand that after the fall a double covenant not a double Covenant of salvation now don't get tied up in that there's not a form of salvation for the woman and a form of salvation for the man it's all through the blood of Jesus Christ so get out of that all right but a double covenant What he can she can't that's the double cone she's used to rule over her that's a double Covenant so let's read it double code it was made by man and woman true sex another Covenant all together not the original Covenant but another Covenant because we'll read it in a minute were that it was never meant to be sex it was meant to be creation but now another Covenant is made Adam was told in the original condition to multiply and replenish that didn't mean he was told to go have sex no that's not your Covenant you know sex Covenant no no no no you got to get it right not the original Covenant but another Covenant now what's introduced polygamy in all and after the beginning polygamy was introduced in both in male and Beast Man and Beast after the beginning the fall now God secondarily sets a new nature Again by sex God created the first without sex do you believe that you're supposed to say Amen right now it's another Covenant with nature he sits it in another order by sex second Covenant one male many females one buck deer one whole arm of those is that right one bull a whole herd of cattle the cows one rooster yard full of hens is that right one David after his own heart with 500 wives with 100 children born to him in one year of different women a man after God's Own Heart one Solomon with a thousand lives but notice it wasn't so at the beginning but now it's after the beginning the woman has done this and she just becomes what she is now all right no a lot of people get offended because we read about the woman but we don't just beat on the women here we go down to the whole story but I still have to say it it was the woman's fault God that's true now we have to go with that because it's truth it's not beaten on nobody is telling truth so now watch what he says here did you get the point he created with without sex that's another Covenant word and under this Covenant polygamy is brought into being right that's allowed to be the word that would be a type of Christ in the church we know that right all right we'll get back to that but it was brought into being for that purpose but remember it's only a type a type won't save you right you're not saved by type amen top strong contemporary forms to draw you to the antetops perfect perfection but look what he says now that was there so we're going on to 2 30. number two now you notice in First Corinthians 17 notice Paul commands a wife that is that divorces her husband to remain single or be reconciled not to remarry she must remind single or be reconciled back to her husband she cannot remarry she must remain single but notice he never said about the man see you can't make the word lie from the beginning the sex law about polygamy now the word of gods runs through with nature of God runs in his continuity I've only dropped the point now First Corinthians is in the New Testament we're going to try to keep the type but remember it's in the New Testament though we must get some understanding are we going to go into Mass confusion right first before the beginning from the beginning there was just one and one after the sin came in then there was one man and a bunch of women run that way in nature every animal and human beings and nature of flesh is an animal we're a mammal we know that all of us and see it's all God's nature in continuity all right so what happened what happened in the Garden was Eve and the sin that took place and she brought it all down upon the human race but remember now Adam walked out willingly we want to say to try to type Christ that's all right but when he got out he couldn't type him right well he walked out he couldn't top crossed had he stayed in the garden and that Eve condemned and destroyed you might talk about Adam and typing but be real careful because you're you're just taking your presumptuous ideas because you're not using the prophet in these types right but now remember he can have more than one wife but she can't do that she can only have one husband we'll use this scripture over and over so go ahead to number 2A and let's read it Paul says in First Corinthians 7 and 39 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband living but if her husband be dead she's at Liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord see you stop that married to whom she will you make out anybody can't you but he was specific only in the Lord now I believe that that applies to the man as well as the woman we're going to get into this later maybe where the Pharisees come to Jesus tempting him remember he answered I'm blunt and there was no argument about his answers when he said from the beginning it wasn't so we said because of the hardness of your heart God permitted you so polygamy was permitted polygamy is not the perfect will of God so as I said to start with be careful how you use in your tops and what you're thinking all right he would say well I just married this I married that only in the Lord Believers are supposed to marry believers right well me and my husband well me and my wife wouldn't either she's a Believer but I wouldn't but that don't justify nothing to straighten it up I can't do anything about that but the kids come to me now and my kids didn't marry believers but they knew the story of what they were supposed to do and I didn't holler and scream at him said you can't marry that girl that had to be their choice thank God they married the ones they did and they came on the end to be believers all right but think about it it wasn't God's original plan you said well he had a plan back there and he was going to use he was going to do it with polygamy well be careful you're making him the author of sin but we know that polygamy came into being because God permitted it all right he permitted it but remember our statements to start with is he beating on the woman because of what she done and now said it's okay for the man or is he laying down something that will be used as a type God cannot make you sin and condemn you for sinning my brother's a Methodist preacher 12 years College he said God can't condemn me for being the way I am he made me this way I said he didn't make you that way you made yourself that way he made you right to start with you made the wrong choice but now think about it let's go to who is this number three who is this priest in 1959 1004. why did God ever let sin come on the Earth God was one unit at one time in that unit was attributes and he was a savior by Nature he was a savior if there had never been a sinner how would he ever been a savior he couldn't save until he permitted sin all right isn't that true God's a Healer he cannot heal unless there be something sick Etc et cetera his own attributes projected these things there had to be something to respond to that attribute that was in God all right now he permitted sin he didn't make sin and neither can he take polygamy to correct sin he can allow it to type but remember a type is not the positive our correct will of God so he didn't make us sin he didn't make Eve sin he created her on a free moral agency now I know when they're laying on my desk at the house already printed off if you want to talk about it how that we can say well he made her that way he designed her that away where she could fall well now I've got another one in here that you can't argue with him about it if that's what he done now we know that he didn't make Eve fall but he permitted her to be born the way she was born remember Eve was not an original creation right she was in Adam she was a byproduct in Adam all right then when she was separated she couldn't fall until she was separated because the original creation can't fall all right so she was separated and made a byproduct and remember how the people of this message want to preach it you know a byproduct is comparing a big porterhouse steak to a ground up piece of hamburger meat you know and they say the man's a big older boy he blessed God but the woman she suggests an old spoiled hamburger that's what they call byproducts but you know you go look up the word byproduct it means something of the same value or even greater value we rode to church today in heated warm cars it's smooth and nice the beginning of that was an old Rattle Trap Rinky Dink a model or something which there were cars way back before then now brother Johnny likes to ride in it but he ain't gonna ride in that with Susan when it's 20 degrees and neither am I unless we're bound somewhere and it can't get no other way you understand what a byproduct is because Eve was in Adam in the original creation right then she was taken from that and now she's a byproduct coming from that product another product all right made what God didn't make her to be in a fallen estate right he made her perfect how can he create anything it's not perfect I don't care what you want to argue product byproducts God can't create anything imperfect so the woman wouldn't create it imperfect he was created perfect all right I didn't say Eternal I said perfect all right then she was given the opportunity of three more agents since she failed right she failed and you know what God permitted her to fall he didn't make her fall he cannot make you fall and judge you for falling now get that out of your mind well I can't help it he made me this way that's what women say you know so now think about it he's a Healer why because he already was a Healer he's a savior because he always was a savior how was he going to get that displayed without any form of being lost right so he didn't make her lost he made her with a choice her choice made her go wrong but now remember the original creation couldn't fall are you with me but now it took a pretty good tumble when Adam took his free more agency and walked over with Eve remember he had a choice and his choice was to don't want her but he made a choice and his choice was to go with her and I'm sure it was to try to save her you know you know we don't give Adam credit for being a child of God with a great understanding because he thought well if I go with her I can get her back right but that wouldn't work because when he walked out he found out he was lost all right no just being slow and thinking and that way he didn't make her wrong because if he'd made her wrong he couldn't judge her for being wrong I hope you understand that I'll get your well I think it's this way I don't give a hoot what you think it's got to be in that word you got a right to think yes as a human being sure that's fine but when it comes down to that word we don't have no right to question it's either right or wrong There's No Gray areas in God's word you see the right or wrong you know all right so then that way we can approach the Fallen condition as not God making a fallen condition but God knowing if he made her like that she would fall and she did but he knew enough about Adam with the confidence he had in him to know that Adam would walk out with her so it's not all just beating on the woman right remember Sarah was doing pretty good because she was willing to go with the King to try to save her a wubby's head but he was scared chicken-hearted you know he wanted to give her away because he probably had it in his mind I give her away God will take care of it you know that's a good point but remember you're planning it that doesn't work okay now let's go on a little look what he said on good does God change his mind about his word 1965 418 number three a well if the people won't walk in his perfect will but if the people won't walk in his perfect will he does have a permissive will let you walk him notice he permits it all right but he will make it work out for his glory I love that in his perfect will he so he permits it he permitted to fall that's his permissive will but he's going to take that and he's going to make it work out for his perfect will now dire is where polygamy enters the picture not as trying to save you come on not as trying to save you to bring in polygamy no but to try to start back toward the from the permissive to the perfect and he couldn't do it let me say it this way and wait let it be he couldn't do it no other way he would right that's right so he takes polygamy to start back toward the perfect will it's going to take a long time to bring that back into the perfect will see you're going to see and I'll go ahead and put it in you're going to see why he can but she can't if you'll pay close attention to what I'm talking about and that's still now might get you interested enough to think all right well look he permits it but he'll make it work out for his glory in his perfect will so he permitted us to be lost but he's going to bring it back to the perfect will right okay watch now just like in the beginning it was not God's perfect will for children to be born on the Earth through sex no sir no we knew it God created Man Out of the Dust to the Earth breathed the breath of life into him and he became a living Soul he took from that man a help mate and made a wife to him that was God's first and original will but when sin can't come in and did the thing that it did then he permitted man to marry a wife legally and have children by her multiply and replenish the Earth then if that's the way you're going to do it but you see it never was his perfect will was never his perfect will for it to be by sex all right he created Adam and Eve what's the problem of him creating you and I but what I don't understand and why people don't want to follow such a wonderful beautiful picture you know that he's right now creating you come on why can't we see the truth he started in that new birth and coming up that statue of a perfect man he's creating you right back like I tried to show between the two bottles you know that when we walk off this Earth we're going to be back just like it would have been had there been no fall amen amen why can't we wake up and these preachers oh boy I got this great Revelation I got this great thing you know the first thing you know how's the congregation going off in polygamy and the other half of them is going off in big of me another one going off in Higgins means and whatever other words you want to fart why can't we follow the truth so he's going to take his permissive will and he permitted it he used it as a type to type Christ in the church because he knew Christ in the church was not going to be now listen real carefully it was not going to be just Jesus and one person that would not be perfect will it was going to be Jesus with a many membered body but you know what neither one of them can have another husband and when it's all settled and done in case you get lost in what I'm doing it's all settled and done because one day Paul said it is the husband or one wife maybe we can find out something you say you mean to save it God would do this but I remember you in the scriptures he said so can clay say to the Potter why did you make me thus can't do it all right we're going to read a whole bunch right here so go ahead with number four on marriage and divorce we'll start on paragraph 148. I want you to read this you may now ask me why did he permit her to be designed thus now you can go into that and run your mind crazy and I'll be glad to give you the quotes to help you if you want it because he says Satan is her designer now Satan did not design Eve he's the designer of women today God designed Eve in a way that she could fall but didn't make her fall Satan's her designer now so be careful which one you're dealing with why did he permit her to be designed to us I don't want to take too much time because I got a lot more to say here why the question will rise then why did God make this woman like this why did he permit her to be like that it was for his own good pleasure oh God designed a woman exactly the way he wanted her design for his own good pleasure now not to where he could come down have a relationship with her no no no don't be stupid he designed her to where she would work out his perfect plan because he knew if he made her she would do it huh why did he make this woman like this why did he permit her to be like that it was for his own good pleasure now he gives a scripture if you want to argue with him about it now if you want to turn in the Bible just a minute let's turn to Romans 9 just a minute and show you something how God does these things if you want to to read it and you can see here what God does for his own good pleasure Romans 9 14. then what shall we say then is there unrighteousness before God when he chose Esau or chose Jacob and rejected Esau before either boy could have a right to make a choice himself neither one of them before they were born still in the womb of the mother God said I hate Esau and I love Jacob why why did God be like that because he knew what Jacob and Esau was going to be right that's easy that's just for knowledge he knew what he was going to do he knew what Adam was going to do right now watch him he said unto Moses I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion yes but Lord you done wrong in my case you made me so of a woman until I can't live without a man he didn't make you that away you read too many Love Story magazines all right a lot of the things has gone on because of women reading about other things some of you are smiling and some of your frowning some of you know that you read the wrong magazine right because you see you wouldn't have known about these things if you hadn't read about them right are you understanding I'm trying to show you what's happening now to relate back to what happened back there okay God said I'll have compassion on whom I'll have compassion then it is not him that willeth not him that runeth but it's God that shows Mercy for the scripture says unto Pharaoh even for this sign purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore he now watch here for he Mercy on whom he will have mercy in whom he will he hardens remember he's reading the scripture is why he's saying different things he's reading the Bible itself all right and saying his other words in between thou will say unto me why do I send us he find fault in other words if God made me wrong why does he find fault but he didn't make me wrong so he can find fault right for who has resisted his will man who art thou that revile us against God so the same form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus hath not to Potter power over the clay of the same love to make one vessel to honor and to utter to dishonor what if God willing to show his Wrath and to make his power known endured such long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessel of Mercy which he hath before prepared unto Glory that's very simple reading to me God didn't make us wrong we can't blame him for being wrong he made us with a choice I'm talking about here not even even the garden he made us with a choice right and that choice that he made was because of what he knew we'd do is that sensible yeah then he didn't make me wrong I said oh God you can't blame me for being wrong boy that's going to be a good one I don't think the devil would even come up with that much all right now argue with that a while God did it he had to make it this way it had to be there now listen now for about five minutes I want to call your attention or something this is continual reading now what where we're at what is God God is a great Eternal at the beginning way back before there was a beginning he wasn't even God did you know that God is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him he lived alone and in him was attributes what is an attribute of thought what is an attribute adult all right so we're getting to the attributes of God to be savior healer Etc so we had to permit something to be lost he had to permit something to be sick so he could just play his abilities of what he already wanted before the world all right which we say but but now but I I it's not my fault you're a free moral agent it's your choice right now you can change right now or you can go on with your own carnal thinking right look at the next one number five take them from marriage and divorce I wish you'd listen to the or read the whole message paragraph 101 why did notice why did she do such a thing being in that high order now look she was right with man co-equal with him right now that ain't much of a byproduct you just buy it I hate people that make jokes out of the Bible you get the preacher you get in the pulpit and you say that woman's a byproduct said she'll buy everything she can and everybody just laughs I don't laugh because that's making a joke of the Bible that's not what it's talking about it she's a byproduct well answer for them kind of jokes she was right with me in coika with him but we all know that she lost her Co week Oneness with man when she sinned and God said man will be your ruler from here on and that's a scripture if you want to we could read it and give you the scripture in the time to hook it up notice uh she did that how did Satan never get to her did you know Satan was co-equal with God one day sure was I'll be the Creator Satan was cruel equal God over the Creator he just couldn't create he was everything stood at his right hand of God in the heavens a great leading cherub notice the reason she did this she was not in the original creation she is not in God's original creation she's a byproduct therefore at the beginning as Jesus referred to she was not original create not original creative being of God she's a byproduct of a man when Jesus referred to the beginning now that's what I'm wanting to do the because I know I think a little bit different than what most people think and most people think well boy one of these days we're going to get there and there's going to be Jesus and there's going to be us and that's wonderful but you know what I want to think about getting there and he's in here I don't want him just standing over there that's the perusias the doctrine to the people of the message I want him in here right all right remember now what notice what a byproduct and notice the only one of God's creation of every animal anything else she was the only one designed this way all right every other female was in the original creation every other female was an original Christian but Eve was not in the original Christ so he had to be so that had to be made that way we'll get to it after a while and notice in the creation that she was in not in the original creation but a byproduct in this creation now a byproduct a creation you just think how that if it should have stayed in that original there would have been no sin all right but there would have been no display as a savior A Healer and things so what happened in the garden was to bring out you know into the right one look at his next one we'll have to quit on this one number six which is Revelations chapter 5. paragraph 86. that's his plan that's the way he did it God knowing that man would fall yet he could not make man fall knowing man would be lost though he did not want anybody lost but to order that the great display of the attributes of God might be manifest in all man that he could be a redeemer he could be a savior man had to fall it was in him to fall what then it was in God to redeem him again that's the we have to have not time to make a display Pros in the cons right are you following me and we'll quit on that we'll take up the attributes part later and see what going with it you might be surprised this afternoon we've got a little surprise and we're not going to tell you what it is until this afternoon okay but listen do you understand just a minute come on musicians do you understand that when God in the beginning he did not make Eve wrong he made her perfect beautiful standing right there with Adam that she came out of his side and her problem was work she's tried to find another side to stand with right the Beast deceived her into doing what she done and when she did he brought the whole human race into sin but that question I asked you does polygamy do away with sin is it that God said to Eve look you messed up and had two partners I'm gonna make it over here for Adam where he can have all he wants to make you mad and all stirred up because from now on you'll only have one and if you get more than one amen you're an adulteress now remember I gave you scriptures if her husband be dead she's free to marry all right see so if a man's wife is dead he's free to marry when was her husband is dead she's free to marry only in the Lord which means according to the rest of the word of God is that right so he can go out and just grab any woman and say I want this woman that's mine I know she's been a prostitute before she deferred to prostitute I want her no well the Bible says I can put my wife away and marry again you got stipulations about getting married again it's not just the hardness of your heart that they put them away for anything they wanted to be in the Bible Jesus said except it be for fornication you see we went and married and we've done these things on our own we wasn't worried about what God says and that's what Terrence says about it and my point is you married the first time because of sex desires and lusts everybody know it was love it was love the second time I might have a little love to do with it but the first time I was just playing out old sex I loved him when I first seen him but I loved him when I first seen him you know I mean it was love at first sight no it was love at first dog you got to think before you can have any desire just be honest with me I try to be honest with you so then my saying is what first time you married for sex second time you married for money that's about right true what you see Church in the garden polygamy never done away with sin I ask you again though because we're going to keep on that dog you can say all you want to about it was permitted to top Christ in the church I'm still going to ask you the same question what does polygamy got to do with it today we're still typing Christ in the church right then you might figure out why it says he can but she can't that's today when we get all that figured out then you'll come up with understanding hey this thing is a beautiful story and God has really worked out his plan and purpose and come forth with a wife that can be one with him which you'll be a many-membered body go to the right scripture let's stand what we got brother return number 42 in uh 42 anybody have a need foreign yes I feel like traveling on I feel like graveling on my heavenly home alone it is no no yes my heavenly homies right in the fair I feel like traveling look at this one now let others seek home below I feel like
