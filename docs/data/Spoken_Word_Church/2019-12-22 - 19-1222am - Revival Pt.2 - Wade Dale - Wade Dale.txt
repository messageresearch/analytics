gifts and things from last weekend brother Dale also he's told you that Wednesday night but truly blessed we all are that we can have a place to come and a place to be safe there's not many safe places in this world anymore but this is a safe place and I'm not just talking about safe from robbers and thieves I'm talking about from the great thief and the great robber the devil we're safe from that so if you got your Bibles we turn to psalms we're gonna start with revival part 2 we're going to review part 1 we've got both services today I want to make announcements now remember there will be no Church Wednesday because that will be Christmas Day and we'll celebrate with our families is that phantom it's hot up here also dad will be doing both services next Sunday brother Chris long is

different during that time but we don't recuperate like that we recuperate in that we get to hear the word of God and have singing till about midnight so just come and be with us also in January the

our fellowship meeting here at the church that will be brother Aaron McGarry he used to be from Texas now he's from North Carolina so he'll be speaking for us we we've known him for a little while good brother real good teacher he's a lawyer but don't hold that against him some but him and his dad have been in the message for a while but he'll also be here that Sunday to do both services for us on January the 19th so that kind of gets you into into January so god bless you let's go to Psalms 85 verse one we've been speaking last winds there a couple winds ease go on revival just to set up just to set a basis here because we have to understand what brings revival what happens at a revival and what happens after a revival because there's been many many revivals but as we look here and we're going to read in the scripture that there's one more left and we're it so we can look at the examples of all the other revivals and we're going to do that we're going to track them all the way through the Bible we did one couple winds these ago we'll do one or two more today but I want you to see what what happens during the revival that way you'll know what's going on when you know you're in a revival man so the Book of Psalms verse 85 I mean chapter 85 verse 1 through 7 and let's bow our heads before we get started thank you Jesus for this day that we can come Lord in a building that's warm no rain on our head the Father we know there's many people across the world that are still assembling today in cold buildings and dirt floors and not much over their head but we serve the same God and we're going to the same place if they're bride of Jesus Christ were going to a city a city that is eternal that we'll never have to worry about rain anymore and all the cold winds blowing and going to funerals and all these different things Lord it'll be a glorious time but we've got to get ready here we've got to make our preparation at this point so we can get there father we know that the journeys been long and hard and for many Lord this too even that just come in Lord it still has been a journey that's been rough because truthfully the Lord even when you were on earth they called you a devil so they're gonna also do the same thing to us father we ask you to forgive us of our sins be with the visitors that are with us today be with the ones that are not with us today be the ones that are sick the ones that need salvation father we still believe that you're a Salvation God that you'll save the souls of the unsaved and bring sinners to Christ father be with us and take care of us place the missionaries on the foreign fields or did you take over the service you have your will and you have your way in Jesus name we pray amen so I'm 285 1 to the chief musician a psalm for the son of Korah Lord thou has been favorable into thy land thou has brought back the captivity of Jacob thou has forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou has covered all their sin thou has taken away all thy wrath it sounds pretty good that it now has turned thyself from the fierceness of that anger turn us O God of our salvation and caused on anger toward us decease wilt thou be angry with us forever this is David remember wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations wilt thou not revive us again that the people may rejoice indeed because every time there's a revival there's a rejoicing alright show us thy mercy O Lord and grant us thy salvation now let's go to 2nd chronicles 7 verse 14 now remember this is this is speaking of the children of Israel but we are the people of God also where this is the present day revelation so we're looking at a present day truth we use the Jews for an example the Bible tells us in in 2nd Corinthians I believe that all this is given in the Old Testament for our example alright for those are the ends of the world come upon so you and I have the eyes thinking the other day if you're not if you're not in the revelation of the present day truth and I don't want to say the message I'm saying the present day truth revelation then you're under a closed book and you cannot see the total plan of redemption so you can't take a body change that's why God can't give a revival to the denominations they're so divided and we're going to bring a home in just a little while and see that it's the same right here mine eyes shall be open if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray now what'd I tell you last week brother Brown said prayer and reading your Bible would get you closer to God but that also begins a revival all right so listen to what the prophet of God said in just a minute and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land what land are we talking about this is the land we're talking about right here I'm not worried about the physical land it takes care of itself we need to take care of this land this is the land that's that that we're dealing with now now mine eyes shall be opened and my ears shall attend unto the prayer that is made in this place for now have I chosen and sanctified this house this house not this building it's already been dedicated but we got to dedicate this house this is the temple that we got to deal with for now I have chosen now buddy when God chooses something he don't let it go amen now mine eyes shall be open to my ear shall attend unto the prayer that is made in this place for now how about choosing and sanctified this house that my name may be there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually in other words from generation to generation are from eternity to eternity you may be seated in the Lord that is a blessing to the reading of the word we're gonna good we get to services we we can kind of go to a place and stop and pick it up this afternoon so Lord bless him we're gonna speak on revival now now listen there's a lot of times we look and we see that when we talk about revival the first thing you think of is is is you know me and brother Dale gets together and we talked to the musicians and we we talk to the song leaders and and we want some of that get music that you know somebody making music you've never been to Jamaica you ought to go one time they know how to worship I said they know how to worship but it's not all just worship you know what you worshipping about a man and I believe if we know what we're worshipping about we don't have to build up anything we don't have to push down anything but if you get in a revival the prophet of God said we'll read in just a minute that it's a personal revival and it begins with you and me so now let's look in the Hebrew lexicon and see what that word revival means now remember revival doesn't mean resurrection revival does not mean resurrection getting born again is a resurrection a revival is reviving what's already there so if you don't have anything there I mean in your soul if there's nothing there you can't have a revival you got to have a resurrection you got to have a dying out to yourself come into the household of God and then you can have a revival of what you've already got hey brother BAM tells us and we're reading a little while we're that even during a revival which means to revive what you already have that as the neck goes out that there are centers that come in there are healings that come in so this revival is not just well if you're if you're a sinner you can't get saved under revival yes you can because you know what a revival may let you realize that you ain't got what you think you got hey ma'am so let's look at the Hebrew let's gonna see what it says about I'm gonna slow down a little bit sorry to leave the word revival to live have life not get life right have life remain alive sustain life brother Nels always said he's been in a revival since she's coming in this message why he got born again come into the message of the hour he's been in a personal revival hey ma'am I hope he has he's been our pastor for 40 years sustain life live prosperously live forever be quickened I hope god quickens what you have be alive be restored to life and health to continue in life or remain alive now what are you and I you and I are today are alive and I want to remain alive because the scripture says those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first now that's going to be a revival you know why because they went down with something their physical body died but their soul didn't die their soul is still that quickening power in another dimension waiting on us to have our revival to get this sky changed and then it's going to pull them out of the ground what do you think the property God called it first pull second pull third pull we're pulling something we're pulling them out of the ground but like I said before it's not gonna be done by how much emotion so much at first cuz we're gonna look here in a minute the children of Israel I mean people we have to go to Walmart and the grocery store to get our food right and if we want water we have to go buy it at Aldi I like Aldi water right God said 2 million people in a dry wilderness and their shoes never wore out they walked for 40 years and they got to a place and said in other words God ain't done nothing for us rained manna every day all they had to do was step out of their tent pick it up put it in a basket and go sit down and eat it this gushing water from a rock running down through the children of Israel and they just dipped up of it and it never did run dry until they got in the promised land but they still with all that great sign and wonder they murmured every single day God even sent him meat because they asked for it but there was a plague attached to that because that wasn't God's perfect will God's perfect will was from the eat that man are coming out of heaven cuz it had every immigrant what about that you know we have to i took a handful of vitamins every morning every afternoon why because we don't get as much nutrition from our food in that little way for a food everything they needed i would have loved it kept some of that because it'll sustain you but still they murmured that's the same way with us we've come down to the end of the road we've come down to this part of this long journey i know we're still murmuring and complaining about what god is not doing for us come on should not be that way we should be the happiest people in the face there he's give us an open book he's even give us the message hey listen when we first started this church that whole back wall was full of 880 thrills you couldn't take but about four or five home with you they were this behind some of you remember the old 80's real then God give us cassettes a little bit smaller yeah you could haul them a little bit better now that phone you're sitting right beside of has got the whole level another sermons on it so what's God give us and we're still murmuring and complaining amen so to live have live sustain life as I said many times before I love that scripture says those who endure to the end shall be saved those who endure to the end there was only two people endured that 40-year journey Joshua and Caleb two people now you know that was that twenty eight twenty year old and younger but they were that whole thing coming up the old people had to die out because their ideas you know that guards not doing anything for us we need to go back to Egypt we see that's happening now they're headed back to Egypt God never wants you to go backwards we're supposed to see what happens in the past bring it to a present-day truth amen that's great what happened to that Pentecost wonderful that was for 120 in the Upper Room but what about today what about this revival that we should be under today let's read Hosea 6 and 1 well they're 6 and 1 watch come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revived us what is the date of God a thousand years as a day in the day as a thousand years so after two thousand years God is going to revive us now we know there's been revivals all down through the ages but there's got to be one after two days in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight that means God here that means God's here will live in his sight you got that same man now listen to this let's go to some of you that have your quotes in your hand these were inserted so you won't have them you got to read them up here go to number a we're going to talk about a lot of revivals but then we've got when we talk about a lot of revivals we've got to come up to the present day revival alright which will be a couple of messages down the road now watch what brother Branham said this is Dennis rising of the Sun 1965 there was the first sheaf come up from all the prophets which was the son of God the king of all prophets look at this here's my point there has been churches churches Brides Brides churches listen he said brides brides churches churches brides bride churches brides brides all the way for two thousand years gods had churches and he's had brides but there has got to come one hallelujah there has to come a real bride not saying that other bride was false they had their time they had their box but that was during that two days they weren't in the third day you and I are in the third day but there's got to come one there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church die oh this makes that church live moving the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs let me insert something you know what he's saying what is what good does it do to think the clouds wrong or the dates are wrong we're polishing hubs we're polishing hubs I don't care I'm like brother Dale I do I care the property God gave me an open book to God Himself that's what the children of Israel they oh we got a clown we got some father God reign Manor down out of heaven and they still said God what he be done for us that's what's happening now God what have you done for us he sent you everything you needed what good does he do to polish the hubs what does it does it do good does it do to give her a facelift and some of you young people don't know what a simonize job is who knows what a simonize job is not many Simon eyes was a car wax and you had to literally get out there and do this you ain't kidding and then you had to wait until it dry I'm telling you this for a story you have to wait till it to dry and then if you miss the spot you're in trouble cuz it showed up what good does it do to give it a facelift or just shine the car the car is the message that's the vehicle to get us out of here okay I don't it doesn't matter to me like I said I know one thing's for sure that sign if you can see Christ in that sign it's a sign not to be denied no matter how much the mechanics proves to be right there has got to be dynamics to make it work everybody got that same man now watch this next quote 1965 go to this evil age you won't have it on your notes this would be number B I picked these up while I was in and now watch this right here now watch what brother Brown says and garter this evil ways now that kind of listen go to this evil age and the northern ones at the end time I'm gonna add that to it you should listen to that tape or read that book also because go to this evil agent or no one's the endtime kind of go together alright because who is godless evil age then or anyone's at the end time amen it is now watch it is that both engaged brides believe Satan's knowledge against God's Word that's why I'm telling you folks when we get finished it's got to be a word revival not a revival of emotion and that feels good Egypt felt pretty good I mean Israel felt pretty good when they come out of Egypt but what in that long journey they started murmuring and complaining in this long 50 years since the Prophet left they now start murmuring and complaining and forget what God did for them already but we got to be established in the present day truth the bride of Adam believe Satan's knowledge against God's Word and the Bride of Christ I'm gonna give her we um I want you to look at my backside the bride of Adam believes Saint not look and the Bride of Christ has believed Satan's knowledge look how close he didn't say the bride of the devil he said the Bride of Christ has believed Satan's knowledge I like what brother olltii said he said science and God are contrary God's the greatest scientist who ever was but man scientific learning is contrary to God amen so whatever they can scientifically prove about all this clouds to forget it it's Satan's knowledge look in this intellectual evil age against God's Word and notice even the natural that believed it and plunged the whole human race to death the natural bride Adam the natural man of the earth his bride before he got to her to be wife plunged the whole human race into death whether it's scientific or not we die just the same because God said we would whether you're in holy eating o Lord we fixin good clothes our Holy Church our holy denomination or whatever it might be you'll die the day you disbelieve one word of God's Word to be the truth one word when it's vindicated and proved to you that's the day that's why they told Jesus they said they said all these people you know got man in the wilderness and Jesus looked at him and said there everyone did their everyone dad and brother Bram said that's eternally separated from God there everyone dad why they turn to word down when it was vindicated and proved to him when this message has been vindicated and proved to its over and over and over again they denied that's the day you separate yourself from God not just the whole sentence one word whosoever shall add one word or take one away that's the day you die and you know what remember brother Brown said he thought she got away with it because she didn't die that day but God said hey you're not gonna live a thousand years right Methuselah lived 969 years you're not gonna live that day amen that's why we're gonna have a millennium where there'll be a thousand years well everyone will live that day that thousand years to prove that that curse had been took away look what he says whether you're in Holy Eden message our Holy Church our holy denomination or whatever it might be you'll die the day you disbelieve one word of God's word to be true that's why it's got to come back to a word revival they bring Brides brides churches they've had revivals since Israel came out of Egypt but there's going to come one that's going to take this word and stand on it regardless if this church physical falls apart so what thank God he gave us a prophet a vindicated prophet yeah I'll clap too [Applause] because he didn't point us to him he pointed us to Christ and that's good enough for me cuz all the others they point to their self most of the time amen y'all want to have a little something here you know we in 2017 we we spoke about the year 2019 which is coming to an end and I never said the rapture was gonna take place but I told y'all something would happen in 2019 actually I told you in October 2019 well that's when they started turning this word down the big people did started turning the message down and started going away listen let me tell you something it never deterred Joshua and Caleb one time when Caleb when Caleb come out of 40 years of listening to that junk Caleb stood and says give me my Mountain I am as strong today as I was when you told me 40 years ago I was gonna come into this promised land Oh Lord that made him 80 years old I taught to make y'all happy your older ones well the deal will be 80 this year so he's Caleb Caleb taking over the mountain amen all right now look let's talk for just a minute about this revival number one the deity of Jesus Christ now watch this is the prayer we read these last couple weeks ago but I'm gonna say this and I'm not gonna say it again those you that don't come I doubt you watch the services because if you look we see all the views you know there's a beekeeper friend of mine he talks about beekeeping he's got five million viewers he gets 50,000 hits about three hours after he puts a little how to put a bee in a bee box we have the sermons of the Living God and you get 20 views there's more than 20 of you kids sitting in here today I'm telling you it's just shame and I'm saying it from brother Russ dunker he called me the other day said it's a cry and shame that your people can't watch those sermons and you get 20 views and all these other people on YouTube get millions thousands hundreds as soon as they put something on why you know what the Word of God is not popular but we review because we know that's going to happen and I'm just reviewing life's Wednesday sermon so if you didn't watch it which probably didn't because there's only about 30 views on it then we're going to redo it again so you can pay attention watch this is brother Browns prayer and now this is the 1949 and now start a revival in the hearts of the people this morning Lord may this be a renewing time we're coming into 2020 a new a new decade not a century sorry I said century the other day a new decade there's no more 2001 t10 we're in 2020 come into a new decade a new renew at a time when the Spirit will be renewed you look at all the preachers we've had in business in for the past three or four times we're all on the same page and I'm telling you we're going to see that because brother Brown said the Holy Ghost would have not have fallen would not have fallen on the day of Pentecost if they hadn't been in one mind and one Accord one one setting over going well I think that thing that cloud over Jesus's head I don't know if that was you know John Peter James and John said Wilbur and go I I was there on top of that mountain but I saw something but I didn't see Jesus glorified I saw this and I saw come on paper good grief they were in one mind in one Accord Jesus told them what to do and they did it they went up to an upper room of course it was scared to death they didn't know what was going on but boy when the Holy Ghost fell that's our problem I think the problem was the mixed multitude in Israel it wasn't all so much Israel and now start a revival in the hearts of the people this morning I'll make a coming here in just a minute may this be a renewing time a time when the Spirit will be renewed I know Father we pray it this way come get us by the hand look how personal this is each one of us and walk us down this Lane here in other words walk us down this journey that we're on show us show to us this great picture that said in order here revealing your secrets to the Saints hearts this morning that's 1949 he hadn't even started his message yet amen and as we walk down Lord then Lord in the armor of God may we go as gallant soldiers to face the enemy but how could we face him unless we know his tactics and help us this morning to understand and show us the his foreground there so we'll know where to meet him for we ask it in Jesus name Amen what a what a prayer now let's go to number 2 this is this is from 1951 the angel of the Lord Toledo Ohio and when we see these crowds gathering that doesn't mean revival that's just the gathering all right so we're not looking I want to fill this church up it's almost full now but it's not a filling up of church it's filling up for the people it's already in the church that's just a gathering but a revival is when people get really right with God and pray through and starts a revival throughout the city and everything you see they put away sin put away their iniquity and turn to God turn around and start back again down the road alright let's go to number three brother I feel real good resurrection of lives of 1951 I'd feel good about it anyhow what this church needs today is a good revival not a new doctrine we don't need a new doctrine we got the truth a new order just the stirring up of what you already know about Hey number four expectations 1961 now a minister cannot bring a revival number four now a minister cannot bring a revival like I said I can stand here and go art bro John you need to sing all the songs that are up-tempo brother Lewis you need to sing all the songs that are up-tempo I want you to go out there and run the aisles and while most of y'all would probably be back next service but you know that's not what you say well what you you're trying to bring a revival I'm not trying to work anything up you're gonna have to do that I mean listen if some of y'all raise both hands it takin anointing probably being gay to get you to raise your hands I'm serious let me sit down like a bump on a pickle this is the greatest thing everyone's in the face of the earth you just sit there say any man every once in a while most of you ain't men like this and that's okay but let it know how to labor once in a while there's no preacher can bring a revival now see that's all across the land back when how did you interpret that Lewis when you come back into the land you look out in the land you see all the preachers trying to create a revival I told you we were looking there brother Summerall back in the 70s I think he was calling for a revival because they he said they'd never been one now see brother brandman just went off the same greatest healing revival there ever was and he had to be there and know about it because he was in his 70s or so in 1970 something but he's calling for a revival now that's okay to call for a revival we have revivals you know the the Methodists and the Baptist they'll have every year they'll have a revival what's their revival their revival is to get more church members because they can't revive people under a whole Iike under of Father Son Holy Ghost baptism they can't revive their self they keep being revived I'm a Reaper the brother said that's the problem denominations God cannot start a revival in a denomination you got to have a word revival you got to have the word just make sense you got to have the word you got to have it lined up right number four now Minister cannot bring a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it with him that's in my unique situation is I'm a minister but I'm also Lansing so I can try to create a revival inside of me same way with you brother they'll ever call up and the only thing he can do is just be loyal to God in His Word and I think we have and the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life now revival isn't adding new members to the church its reviving that what you've already got to revive means to bring back everybody got that same man now listen this room number five leave us out this 1951 what we need today is an old-fashioned gun set God sent revival clean up the home start in your house start in your house start in your house physical and then this house clean up the heart get things ready start a revival in your home and it'll begin its church preacher don't bring it in his briefcase so don't blame me and brother Dale because there's not a revival ha it's your fault but we're gonna do everything we can to get you in line God gets you in line where you can have a revival God sends it from heaven to the individual all right so that's why I say that the world is out there looking and they're gonna get it they're going to get an anointing just like brother Dale said I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh everybody's gonna get into this great rushing revival I'm Eve you remember how many times I've preached and told you and look how close this getting now there's somebody gonna raise up in this message I said in this message this is gonna have a healing campaign and all the signs and wonders but be off and his doctrine and people are gonna flock to him like you would not believe because that's anointed once if he's faults in this doctrine while his brother Dale keep reading that scripture if a prophet prophesy and it come to pass believing but if a prophet prophesized and it comes to pass but he takes you to another god now see that's anti word what is there's only one God if he takes you to another god that's anti then you don't believe him doesn't matter about the signs and wonders preacher don't bringing in his briefcase God sends you from heaven to the individual that's true alright let's read number six Elisha the prophet mothers of old they love to raise children but all this modern American day that we're living in now I tell you our nation is simply polluted there's not a hope left to this nation as I see only an old-fashioned revival and according to the scripture it'll never be nationwide now listen brother Brown is a prophet I don't like to say brother I'm was a prophet he still is a problem he's still prophet okay so brother Branham is the prophet of the end time we gotta believe what he said there's no hope left to this nation as I see only an old-fashioned revival and then he stops and he says and according to the scripture it'll never be nationwide so don't worry about a nationwide revival don't worry about it breaking out in so-and-so's message church over here you got this messy church right here that we deal with it'll never be nationwide so then we're just left it'll be a revival among the people now watch what he said comma the elect of God but it won't be a real sweeping revival take the whole nation then never was never will be okay so don't worry about a world revival brother Brown said what about the third police it won't be a public show so now let's read number seven now watch this it's on third seal now watch today the reason that revivals were supposed to have we've had denominational revivals but it can't be a word revival okay we have denominational revivals we haven't had we we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we have it now this is 1963 the opening of the seals greatest revival ever struck the earth but it was a word revival that was so simple so hid nobody understood it at that time remember on the sixth seal he said it's gone from us-- not for you men don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members I say we got millions and millions and millions of so-called message believers but not a revival know where the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifest sensation of God to stir the bride yet we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again you say well brother you fish didn't get deep plan of redemption how can you get away from the plan of redemption how many tell I preached a year and a four months on the seals to show you the plan of redemption that's the thunders to wake her up again he will send it he promised it now that's dust authority he will send it he promised it and then I say it's today everybody got then say Amen now look and we'll give you a reason right here and then we're gonna read Genesis let's go to number eight now look what brother Brown was doing in ninety since 1948 he's in the Christian businessmen's Association watch but if all the Full Gospel people would come one heart in one Accord now this is 1948 in 1906 on the zuzo Street God poured out the Holy Ghost on the people right the Holy Ghost himself coming in the fullness of the baptism to give them signs and wonders and to give them a healing campaign amen so this is 1948 brother Branham is beginning starting into the healing campaign of his message but that part remember he does two things remember Malachi 4 does two things turn the hearts of the fathers to the children hey my children to the father's back back four children to the father's for us and then he brings a message of the seven thunders or the opening of the seals alright so he's not there yet he's 1948 he's bringing a revival a healing revival I told you before the reason that revival came and I'll read something because you have to look at the characteristics of a revival so we're gonna look at several revivals I want you to see the characteristic of how God starts them through the people and then how they end now listen ours is not going to end ours and it is an eternal revival I hope you get that cause if it's a word revival it can't go away the word is forever eternal so when we begin into this word revival that's what's going to take us through the body change right through the resurrection body change take us all over into the another dimension until God cleans this place off then we're gonna come right back here for a thousand years on a honeymoon then we're gonna go back out again dogs gonna wipe this thing off and then we're gonna live in a future home but it starts today it started the day you receive the new birth but now what do you say brother wait we got to revive that new birth again being born again but if all the Full Gospel people would come one heart and one Accord now here's the problem we've had for 50 years there would be a revival that would shake the whole world and every spiritual gift would be in the church within an hour after it took place signs and wonders that was done by the Apostles would be a minor thing - what would do if we could just get the church together one thing it's got to happen it will happen it maybe after I passed off the same but I want to put my word in this that you might know that my voice is this old Christian people bind yourself together with one heart and one Accord watch this for God cannot send everybody says well God why aren't you sending a gift why you're not sending it here's the answer God cannot no more send the gifts to the church while the church is separated then he can send the Holy Ghost unless you're in one Accord that's right for it comes by the Holy Ghost believe it let me read you one more listen to this one number nine the faith that was once delivered to the Saints I think there's nowhere nineteen forty eight and fifty that's the reason we can't have a revival you got to get back to God's faith again in the Bible what's happening today they're tearing it apart what's happening in the message there's message churches on each corner in certain places and they don't even speak to each other how can God work in that he can't it's a separation that's been the problem and I'll say something in a minute and you don't know like it but I'm gonna say it anyway you've got to get back to God's faith again in the Bible where men and women become born-again and regenerated by the Holy Ghost then that man can't help from being a Christian he's a Christian by birth that's right you don't have to pledge him please come to church machine paid time you don't have to pledge him and give him cards and visit him Oh Lord oh Lord if he's born again brother you almost have to this is worse gonna hurt some of you you almost have to borrow the door to keep him out now for some of y'all that's not a problem you get the cart before the horse that's what's the matter you've got to get Christ first in the stead of the church you got to put Christ first that's what we need today that's what America needs what the whole nation the whole world needs today is an old-fashioned revival stirring God sent revival but remember there's no nationwide revival that's going to start inside of you but what was the problem in these two quotes there was one problem in both quotes separation separation this church can't stand that church this church can't stand that church this church I thinking the other day I thought God this is the worst thing I could think but I'm gonna thinking anyway you go to these big meetings six and seven hundred people and brother would be one time a long time ago before he died he told brother Richard Wilson he looked into ministers meeting we had about 60 ministers up there in North Carolina he looked around he said wonder how many different opinions are in this building now folks that ain't right there's only one truth it's like somebody said to the day brother right you both can't be right either one wrong and one right or from you can't be what both of you the right not right you can't not in the Word of God and Jesus had no division him and the father were one and what did he say in John 17 I pray father that they be one as we are one if you have the mind of Christ you can't bring the false denomination you can't bring the false word you can't bring your opinion that's been our problem in the message for 50 years we are so divided thank god he's bending the ranks sorry but thank God he's thinning the rain twenty hundred doing the Old Testament he had to let all the fighters die I'm sorry what's the truth thank God he's standing the roads cuz we sat in churches 600 people none I told my brother Donny Reagan okay I'm not talking about him I don't mind special meetings we have you've got all these different opinions they're not all in agreement I hate when the preacher says no we've been on the green all things why that shirt Paul and Peter but it wasn't doctrinal it was behavior it was not a doctrinal issue Peter didn't poll didn't say now Peter you're not preaching the right word no Peter had a problem with something he was doing of his own opinion but not in the word because God used Peter to rock the word just as he used Paul to write the word alright so we may have our personal differences amen as everybody in here thinks it somebody else ought to be preaching today my baby I fly said I that don't matter to me that's personal issues but if I tell you the truth you gotta say Amen well bride will say Amen but there's too many I hate to say that but fear not little black I hate to see people fall by the wayside but I'm ready to go home I'm like Caleb I've come to this journey enough I've seen all that behind me there's too many people following this message I said following there's a difference in following and being the message Moses was the message and the messenger Joshua and Caleb became when Moses left Joshua and Caleb became the message of the hour and Joshua was the type of the Holy Ghost brother Bram said Caleb was the top of the believer believer not mate believer not unbeliever but true believer that's been our problem we've been too separated bind yourself together with one heart and one Accord all these things that are going on in this message should not bother you except for the personal people you know you feel for them but you're not gonna go out there to folks you can't do that you can't sympathize you can call the brother and say god bless you brother you still my brother I'm praying for you but I can't go with what you're doing and you know what that's the way you should do cuz watch Genesis 15 15 God said to Abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that's not ours hello somebody is that not us sure this land is ours but we got a squatter on it we got a squatter on this land that we got to deal with now watch thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years remember it was actually 430 God give them a little grace but it was 400 it took 400 years you know it's kind of like the old analogy if you want to you're supposed to boil lobsters when they're alive and you're supposed to boil we frogs you can't just throw a frog in a pot and it boiling it would jump out I've seen lobsters do it I've seen them they'll crawl up to the top and trying to get out why water's hot but if you'll just sit there and go from low - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 in about 30 minutes they think they're in this real warm environment but they're getting their goose cooked and they'll die in there that's what devil's been doing folks he's been turning up just a little bit of the heat just a little at a time 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years 50 years and he has killed good people I'm not kicking people out of the message I'm telling you some people are talking it we probably the other day when you have a battle when Israel went to battle and not before but when Israel went to battle later on they lost good men because it was a battle we've lost good men because this is a battle but what do you do you don't go back to get that man if he's gone he's gone what'd you do you press on and fight the thing that killed him that's what you got to do you got to fight the thing that killed him so that's what we're doing now we're fighting the thing is killed all of our brothers and sisters down to the 50 years but we can't be separated we can't have 15 different ways to preached in your birth Jesus didn't if it's ji if this is Jesus's message why can't we get it right because we know a lot of people don't have the Holy Ghost that's the problem because what the Holy Ghost what'd he tell you in the Bible the Holy Ghost would lead you and guide you into some truth that's not what the Bible said he said he would lead you and guide you into all truth and then that's why we come from the east and the West in different places that's why you see people jockeying around trying to find places go to church why true brides gonna get fed they're gonna find a place to get fed and then so Genesis 15 watch and also that in that 400 years 400 years and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge remember when they left to Egypt Egypt was devastated I mean when we leave this world guess what this world system is going to be devastating and afterwards shall they come out with a great substance now let's go to eggs of this one we'll read this right here and then we'll continue this afternoon if that's all right this is one of the first revivals mentioned in the Bible because remember when Israel came out of Egypt they were still Israelites when they were in Egypt they didn't become different people so God stirred up what was already the promise that was given them by Abram to Abram that you're gonna sojourn here for 400 years you're gonna walk in a strange land but I'm gonna bring you out with a mighty hand and I'm going to destroy that country that held you captive when are we gonna start believing that and the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them all these she's believed was running around now there rose up a new king over Egypt who knew not Joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of Israel are more in mightier than we in other words the Pharaoh looked out there and said man there's more of them than there are of us we got to do something because they could cause an insurrection they could raise up and take us over and he saying this vote behold the people children of Israel more and mightier than the weak come on let us deal wisely with them the devil is not gonna do anything usually stupid he's pretty wise okay come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when their fathers out any war they joined also our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land so now what he's saying is and just to be blunt what he's saying is I'm not just gonna go out there and tell them to quit having kids cuz they'll rebel but I'm just gonna make them work so hard till they're so tired they eat supper and go to bed and sleep all right now I'm really that's truthful what he's doing he's subtly trying to get them to quit having children what's the devil doing he's subtly trying to keep people children of God from being born again for 50 years he's put us in a message church and said you're fine don't you feel it therefore they did set over them taskmaster to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh two cities he put them to work and then what works works don't cut your hair women but make sure you wear your dress and make sure it's like three inches below your your knees and don't wear no slips that are over eight inches we went through all that that didn't save nobody zero people did it's a zero it was just works prove me wrong you tell me all the people that's come in and then left this message and didn't have a new birth they just came in and didn't cut their hair and they wore their dresses and now they're eventually somewhere they went off you get the baptism the Holy Ghost you won't ever ladies put on a pair of pants you won't ever cut your hair you won't ever wear makeup ever so that's why the problem is is not many too many new birth that's what brother Bram said and now in the message has taught seventeen different ways therefore they did not set over them they sorry they did set over them taskmaster to afflict them with burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities those two cities but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel and the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage mortar and brick and all manner of services in the field and in their service wherein they made them serve was with rigor in other words for four hundred years they were just kind of living in Egypt doing their thing planting their gardens building their house having babies and having generations and generation all of a sudden Pharaoh said this is gonna stop mmm Satan said this is gonna stop this too many of them I'm gonna thin the ranks and the king of Egypt speak to the Hebrew midwives now what were we talking about last Wednesday night what is a midwife a midwife is a person that is that their job is is to birth the babies amen what's the preachers job to birth the babies to get the babies into the kingdom and man so watch what say he eat why didn't he go to the leaders I'm talking about the big guys he didn't go to big guys he went to the preachers he's no preacher if you'll not preach what here we go and the king of means expect to the Hebrew midwives of which the name of one was Sephora and the other name was pure and he said when you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stool if it be a son then you shall kill him kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives thank God feared God and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them but save them men children alive remember that's the whole story by Moses when you come up to moses pharaoh said throw all the two-year-old babies into the alligators well moses was born in between there and the king of egypt called for the midwives he brought them back any said hey why have you done this thing you've saved the men's children alive why are you preaching the truth getting these babies born the Midwife said to Pharaoh because the Hebrew women are not as the worldly women amen the Hebrew women is not as the worldly women bunch a weak bunch of people for their lively they go to church and they do lift their hands and they say hallelujah for they're lively they are delivered and the Midwife they are not therefore God dealt well with the midwives listen God's gonna protect the ministry doesn't matter you can't say don't put a name to it he's going to preserve his ministry he going to have a bride as brother Dale says the bride this fivefold ministry it's there there is a predestinated actually there's two oh you didn't know God's got a file I mean Satan's got a fivefold ministry to remember there's twins than ever revival if God's got a true fivefold ministry Satan's got a false fivefold ministry and we see that coming therefore God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty and it came to pass because the midwives feared God then he made them houses and pharaoh charged all of his people said every son that then he went to all the people he didn't just worry he's not dealing with preachers now he's getting into your hmm every son that is born you shall cast him into the river and every daughter you shall save a life God's tried for years to get us to start a revival but we've just been so separated till we can't there's opinions everywhere some do listen to the midwives and there are born again some don't you can't do it on your own you got to have a preacher Amen you got to have a minister according to according to Ephesians if you want to tear that out you can tear it out throw it away if you want to but the Bible says if you take away from the Word of God guess what happens your name is taken off the book alright so in the book of Ephesians that tells us that it takes apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for the perfecting of the saints in other words to get us to a place to get us out of here but that revival has to start in you and I'm gonna stop right there but I want to tell you something you look at all these revivals we just talked about a revival just a few months ago in Daniel 70 weeks we'll read it this afternoon because what happened in Israel they went to the promised land a man Joshua Caleb through through the wilderness Moses took him to a place couldn't take him over amen so Joshua and Caleb took him into the Promised Land but they had to fight for every inch of ground they had to fight fight fight fight fight amen but then all of a sudden somebody comes in and destroys the whole of Jerusalem again toward the temple down Nebuchadnezzar come in and tore it all down took all the stuff away then you see Daniel seven new weeks Daniel nine became a revival for the Jews Daniel 9:24 will read it this afternoon where Daniel didn't just walk in and say bless God where Israel we're perfect no he spends a whole chapter praying for his sin and the sins of the people Nehemiah finally gets to eat it to do it but I'll write I'll read it a minute he finally gets the go-ahead to do it but the first thing he does he falls on his face and says God were sinful people and I preached to you for years that we are the chosen of God we are God made manifest in another form but remember one thing we've still got this guy to worry with I'm talking about the inside guy that inside guy is perfect he's just perfect as he'll ever be or he needs something else it's that spirit realm and the body realm that neat really the body really doesn't it's the spirit realm the memory reason conscience of excellent imagination it's not your problem that's my problem it's what we think reasoning imagination all those different things that's our problem but please know though that your children of Israel not to mix multi to you I want you to know that because you cannot call for a revival if there's nothing in you to revive you can't you've got a call on God to save your soul then you can call on a revival because if you have sin if you have an akin in the camp if you have an akin in the camp you got to get him out before you can move on that's been our problem folks we've been scattered we've been scattered even under this message so many different doctrines and ideas do you think we have the correct one yeah I do I think we can I think we can take the message in the hour and put it together I say we I'm talking like God do the ministry in this church we put it together better than anybody I know you remember what brother Michael Teague said last Sunday he said it seems to people that brother Dale and brother Wade are arrogant he said no he said they're just established in the present day truth listen Paul stood up one day and said you'll be judged by what I say now that would be pretty arrogant if you took it the wrong way and I'm sure people did you know what people did so who do you think here ain't a bishop ain't a prophet Paul used to persecute us you know he used to persecute them people he's in now but Paul had a conversion you and I need a conversion if you don't have a conversion you cannot call for a revival you've got a call for a resurrection from dead works out of sin in your soul then you can be revived in the outside man let's stand to our feet this afternoon we'll starting in the Book of Daniel there but I want you to look at these revivals that's there's one we're going to go to that well there's about five that we're going to talk about this afternoon but remember we're heading toward a word revival everything has always been started by the word because what did Abram God told Abram you're going to sojourn for 400 years that's the word Daniel knew by books that Jeremiah said God said through Jeremiah that you're going to be seventy years in captivity but you're gonna come out with a mighty hand you're gonna build the wall you're gonna build the temple and you're gonna start right back into the service like you were before that's Daniel 7 new week that musicians come had a preacher tell him not long ago one of the ones that's kind of left the message or we're not following it all the way or whatever you want to say we were talking about the Seventh Seal being open and his comment was everybody I know that has said that has lived the life of a sinner in other words all these people that have come forward in the message and said the Seventh Seal is polygamy that's not true that's false polygamy is me polygamy is brother Brown I mean the third Pole of the Seventh Seal that's what is coming and I agree they made it everything in the world external but just like this revival that we're talking about it is not an external revival it is an internal revival in your heart when you go home just like I was doing yesterday I delivered 40 something packages from Noah's Friday for some of you that don't know how to go to our store they're still open and they're probably empty but even delivering 40 packages after I'd already to run around I'd delivering 40 something packages and God was we were talking to each other say you can't you don't have to so I said about the Midwife you don't have to be in a church for God to talk to you he wants to be in this tabernacle anyway so talk to him pray without ceasing don't close your eyes while you're delivering 40 packages though you run into something you don't have to close your eyes to talk to God to me that's really a tradition because Jesus even if Tim allows us he looks up into heaven and he's his father I'm doing this for them you don't have to close your eyes to talk to God if you kept your eyes open you might see him hey man let's sing a song god bless you we'll start again this afternoon geez oh you have a name Neiman you [Music] I mean [Music] the Emily father you heard and now we connect with him Lord with our faith that that child will come home today father and it'll be done for your honor Laurie in Jesus name Amen Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but you know we can stand created us [Music] let's go bail at the Catholic Church do you need dancing anytime you need a pole now you talk to God you start a revival it's a deal what do you want to or not [Music] [Applause] you [Music] even the great Apostle Paul I can't seem all the way [Applause] [Music] and he's not in heaven you brought it with you today [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know you listen to the songs during Christmastime and we know Jesus wasn't born in December we know that okay so we just kind of go along with the world and I kind of like this time of the year everybody's kind of happy I said kind of happy but you know God came down in the form of a baby he had to do that you know they they show the picture of him lying in a manger you know what that was that was a feed trough that's where they apply loo you that's where they fed the animals and there was the man that was gonna feed the whole world if you would just partake of it he was born in a food truck because he said Wonder Bread I filled it understand me you'd understood the children of Israel there was that baby brother [Music] came as a baby drop feed trough or the cattle eat their food and clean it out to put the king of the universe Oh feel good bet he did it for you and he did it for me cuz there's that baby laughs couldn't come back inside you at that time he had to grow up just like you and I have to grow up and mature he had to mature and when he got on that cross and he said I'm gonna take you to a place that you'll never have to die you'll never have to be sorrowful oh dear Heavenly Father thank you Lord at this time of the year Lord they sing songs about you being a baby the Lord we understand who you are you were God Almighty laying in that feed trough and you came for one purpose and that was to get your children so that we could feed off of you and not have just natural life but that we could have eternal life the Bible says you were born Emmanuel God with us and as they sing the song I don't know if they understand it Lord but they call you the great I am laying in that manger if they would have a revelation of that they walk different they talk different if they knew who you are but under inspiration we see that they wrote songs about you maybe not even understanding who you were but Lord God you sent a prophet in the end time they brought an open book that we could see that you came from God and you went back to God and then he said we came from God and we're going back to God Father forgive us of our sins bless us Lord all the ones that are saying Lord I pray now that your healing power would come upon them

and then you promised we'd have a revival loudly give us this day our daily bread till we meet back in two o'clock bless our ministers Lord and ones that are here we pray this you just touch and be with people Oh Hudson Lord and bring him home Lord may that supernatural power go right now to that place and raise them up for your honor and glory Lord Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed I'm
