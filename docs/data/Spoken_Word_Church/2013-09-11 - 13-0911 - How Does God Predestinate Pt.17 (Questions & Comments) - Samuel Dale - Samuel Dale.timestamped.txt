[2:45] we'll be leaving about 10:30 on Saturday
[2:48] morning to let us know and and you know
[2:51] ride with us and have a good time uh I
[2:53] know you've already prayed but remember
[2:55] sister Anna Canard she came to the
[2:58] operation the doctor doctor said it was
[3:00] a a good operation he said I I say it
[3:03] was real good you know he was he was
[3:05] really seemed to be pleased himself
[3:07] about it and only took about 3 hours as
[3:09] far as the actual operational part you
[3:12] know so it must have been everything
[3:14] must have went real good but he said he
[3:16] really thought everything would be all
[3:18] right and she is they've already I think
[3:20] tried to take the tubes out they're
[3:22] doing the different things with her so
[3:24] just keep praying for her she'll have a
[3:25] lot to to do she didn't know she had
[3:28] that and uh you know it was I think she
[3:31] had three blockages 180 and 290 I
[3:34] believe was right I'm not certain but
[3:37] anyhow uh she was walking Time Bomb you
[3:40] wouldn't have thought it by looking at
[3:41] her and and seeing her and doing but yet
[3:44] you know if things had went wrong
[3:46] somewhere she would had a lot of trouble
[3:48] so we thank God he's always on the scene
[3:50] to take care of everything we we believe
[3:52] it right so just remember that I mean
[3:55] any other announcements I generally Miss
[3:58] some but
[4:00] no more all right de Heavenly Father we
[4:03] thank you for your love and your grace
[4:04] unto us thank you for being with sister
[4:07] Anna our Lord and taking care of her
[4:08] because we know even in that case like
[4:11] that and if we don't know what's wrong
[4:13] with us then Satan has the upper hand
[4:15] cuz he can sneak things in on us but we
[4:18] thank you for doctors we thank you for
[4:20] all of these things that to where that
[4:22] we can go and and have these things that
[4:24] are in the old human body fixed cuz
[4:27] we're just kind of like an old car
[4:29] sometimes Parts run out and we need them
[4:31] replaced or or repaired so we thank you
[4:34] that you've given us doctors and things
[4:36] to to help us and Lord we just ask you
[4:39] to guide and be with sister Anna now as
[4:41] she will be in the recovery time and I'm
[4:44] sure it will be a horrible time of of
[4:46] sufferings and things but as Terrence
[4:48] prayed we pray that the pain will be
[4:50] gone and everything will be all right we
[4:52] love you and we thank you we commit it
[4:55] all to you Lord now have your way as we
[4:57] read your word you come and speak to our
[4:59] hearts in Jesus name
[5:02] amen Romans
[5:08] 8 and we know that all things work
[5:10] together for good to them that love God
[5:12] to them who are the called according to
[5:14] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[5:17] did also predestinate to be conformed to
[5:20] the image of his son that he might be
[5:22] the firstborn among many Brethren
[5:24] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[5:26] he also called and whom he called them
[5:28] he also just
[5:30] Justified and whom he justified then he
[5:32] also glorified what shall we then say to
[5:35] these things if God be for us who can be
[5:39] against us you may be seated the Lord at
[5:41] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[5:43] I had a had to go for a a little checkup
[5:46] this week and I got a real good report
[5:50] doctor said everything was in good shape
[5:51] come on back in 6 months you know and
[5:54] all like that but I was kidding him
[5:57] because you know I appreciate doctors
[5:59] and things but they're just like we are
[6:01] if you just be friends with them and
[6:03] things and I was talking to him about
[6:06] something and he said well you know I
[6:08] said well I do a little bit of what you
[6:10] tell me and maybe not everything but he
[6:12] said well people do 80% of what the
[6:14] doctor says he said of course my wife
[6:16] she does 5% of what I tell her I said
[6:20] well that's about right you know but you
[6:22] know but then he was checking my spleen
[6:25] out and he's dumping the cross you know
[6:27] I said what are you dumping on there far
[6:30] he said well I can tell where it's firm
[6:32] I said I thought you was doing that just
[6:33] so you could maybe show us you you know
[6:36] kind of make us think you know what
[6:37] you're doing he just ding life and you
[6:40] know cuz he he really likes for me to
[6:41] come in he always says I appreciate you
[6:44] coming cuz I just I'm just the same
[6:46] there as I am here I just say thank you
[6:49] Lord and everything's all right amen all
[6:52] right now let's just come in a little
[6:55] while and then we'll get into the
[6:57] questions and answers but I want to make
[6:59] sure you understand me and then that way
[7:02] you can ask the questions of of the
[7:05] things you know and and we started off
[7:08] about 16 17 Services ago talking about
[7:13] how does God
[7:15] predestinate all right we found that he
[7:18] predestines because predestination now
[7:22] he predestines by for knowledge all
[7:25] right and predestination see has to do
[7:29] with with uh Life Time Etc because it
[7:35] means uh a destiny set so you're not
[7:39] going back way back that's why I
[7:42] appreciate the way the prophet said it
[7:45] he said you know that predestination
[7:47] looks back to for knowledge right and he
[7:50] said then for knowledge looks to Destiny
[7:52] see and that that way you don't have to
[7:54] to worry because predestination is
[7:57] actually dealing with something within a
[7:59] time frame or U you know things like
[8:03] that and that's why I said all along why
[8:06] would we want to get into so much on
[8:09] predestination and try to stop on it why
[8:11] can't we just keep on
[8:13] going back into the mind of God and
[8:15] that's what we've been doing for weeks
[8:17] you know to go back and see that you
[8:20] know that he even uh he predestines not
[8:25] by
[8:26] desire because he desired that everybody
[8:29] be
[8:29] saved but he predestinated by his for
[8:32] knowledge now you understand what I'm
[8:34] saying so so I'm trying to make blunt
[8:36] statements tonight and then go on and
[8:39] I'm going to make this blunt statement
[8:41] people think that I try to bring a topic
[8:43] a lot of times to argue about what's
[8:45] being taught in the message line of the
[8:47] people uh you know now when when I get
[8:50] to that that that's all I'm doing then
[8:52] you don't have to worry about sitting me
[8:54] down I'll just quit but I'm trying to
[8:57] help you and I righten not to try to
[9:00] just argue with somebody about what
[9:01] they're saying cuz you're not going to
[9:03] convince anybody anyway that's right I
[9:05] mean it's the holy spirit's going to
[9:07] going to convince people he's going to
[9:09] have to show it to them and and I don't
[9:11] matter what you say it's not going to
[9:14] convince them and see I'm trying to get
[9:16] you and I to see how perfect a message
[9:19] amen that we have been given that's
[9:22] right to me it is the word of God that
[9:26] has been given to you and I even
[9:29] understand predestination right amen and
[9:31] to understand like I saying that
[9:33] predestination that has to do with
[9:35] something down here something that's
[9:37] predetermined to take place or or an
[9:40] action or event when we went on back
[9:43] into the for
[9:45] knowledge back his brother R said Christ
[9:47] the Myster of God reveal back into the
[9:49] back part of God's mind the word that he
[9:52] had had a plan and he had a purpose
[9:55] right Amen in that he wanted to see it
[9:59] achieved what to to bring forth his
[10:03] attributes right all right and his
[10:06] attributes is Father Son and Holy Ghost
[10:09] all right so then everything that we
[10:12] have to deal with would deal with that
[10:14] within that Father Son and Holy Ghost
[10:16] you know in in our doings in life but
[10:20] predestination see it's not a bad word
[10:22] then once you see that it's dealing with
[10:25] something that's
[10:27] set predetermined all
[10:30] right whereas for
[10:33] knowledge is dealing with knowledge
[10:36] before amen an event
[10:39] transpires all right then we went back
[10:42] into and spent quite lengthly time
[10:45] talking about the mind of
[10:47] God and I told you in the messages there
[10:51] that Judas is car was in the mind of God
[10:54] right amen he was thought of as coming
[10:56] to Earth and and being what he would be
[10:59] and Jacob and Esau was but see I don't
[11:03] want to just be part of what he thought
[11:06] of I've tried for 40 something years to
[11:09] get you to see I want to be part of the
[11:11] Thinker right all right so we got even
[11:14] into the part that we titled messages
[11:16] and and talked about it is called part
[11:19] of
[11:20] God and we found out to be part of God
[11:24] right is not to be a second person or a
[11:27] third person or something but to be the
[11:30] person of God made
[11:32] manifest in the form of the Bride or the
[11:36] form of his children his offspring right
[11:40] and that way then we could look at it
[11:41] and and not have to to deny some of the
[11:45] things the prophet has said or the
[11:47] scriptures that would say and we read
[11:50] there in the scripture where it says
[11:52] that that those who he
[11:55] forew he did predestinate or did for
[11:58] know
[12:00] he did predestinate well then we won't
[12:02] have to deal with nothing we know what
[12:04] it
[12:06] is he predestines by his for
[12:10] knowledge but yet are we going to say
[12:13] that God could not set back before the
[12:15] world as the infinite God that we've
[12:18] read over and over and over are we going
[12:20] to say he couldn't sit back and know
[12:23] what would transpire on Earth amen once
[12:26] we would get here right right amen I
[12:29] mean you're you're belittling
[12:31] God you're making him down to where he's
[12:34] like you and I he can change his mind he
[12:37] can do things I don't believe
[12:39] that I believe before the foundation of
[12:42] the
[12:43] world and in his mind he could look
[12:47] through all
[12:49] time and see everything that would ever
[12:52] transpire am that's right all
[12:54] right and then you remember now one
[12:57] point we brought out
[12:59] that we were chosen in him
[13:03] yes not to say we were chosen by him
[13:07] because being chosen by him would be him
[13:10] picking out
[13:11] people but if we're chosen in
[13:15] him then all we got to do is make sure
[13:17] we're in
[13:18] Christ or make sure Christ is in us
[13:21] right and see then that way we don't
[13:25] have to worry about it we don't have to
[13:27] deny any quote or any thought we can
[13:30] believe it now when I get into the
[13:32] questions please do this much for me we
[13:34] get into questions I haven't covered
[13:37] anything on the seed yet all right seed
[13:40] s e e
[13:42] d so don't if you ask questions about
[13:46] the seed I'm going to try to just say I
[13:48] I don't choose to speak on that you know
[13:51] because I haven't brought out the things
[13:54] I want you to see about it so hold your
[13:56] point away from that it doesn't matter
[13:59] me with me if you say what are you
[14:01] talking about that's no problem you know
[14:04] but just stay away from from some seed
[14:06] form because we'll get to that
[14:09] eventually and then we'll have questions
[14:11] and answers about that all right but see
[14:14] looking back in seeing that we were
[14:17] chosen in him
[14:19] amen right chosen in
[14:23] him so when he was chosen we were
[14:27] chosen we being a part of
[14:30] him then when the prophet would say if
[14:34] you have eternal
[14:36] life you always was
[14:39] eternal well I have no problems with
[14:41] that
[14:43] quote see I had no troubled with
[14:46] believing then that I wasn't back there
[14:48] as a
[14:50] person as some form of
[14:53] identity the prophet even said were we
[14:55] Spirits he said no we were only in his
[14:59] thinking right all
[15:02] right and see then going back into the
[15:04] mind of God we can go back and see
[15:08] that he had
[15:10] thoughts he had
[15:12] attributes and the prophet says we're
[15:14] his
[15:16] attributes on
[15:18] display all right then I have no problem
[15:21] with saying well I don't believe that
[15:24] anything you're looking
[15:26] at here
[15:29] was in any way in God in the beginning
[15:35] right I don't believe that now I do
[15:37] believe that the body we're
[15:40] in is the body we're going to be in amen
[15:44] all
[15:44] right right I do believe in that I
[15:47] believe in it being made Eternal amen
[15:50] but yet not in this
[15:52] condition and then when you start trying
[15:54] to
[15:57] predestinate see then if you don't go on
[15:59] back P's
[16:02] predestination you're saying that
[16:05] God chose
[16:08] wrong because you got to admit there's a
[16:10] lot of people that are not going to have
[16:12] eternal
[16:14] life well did he choose wrong did he
[16:17] choose one and not choose the
[16:19] other or did he look down and see what
[16:22] we would
[16:24] choose all right and we're going to come
[16:27] back to that because you'll see me the
[16:28] Lord willing Sunday will start on our
[16:31] journey back toward
[16:34] time because we haven't for the past few
[16:37] messages we haven't been dealing with
[16:40] time we've been dealing with eternal
[16:44] life and that's why I believe in eternal
[16:46] life I believe that by the new birth you
[16:51] receive eternal life in your soul amen
[16:55] and that eternal life always was eternal
[16:58] that doesn't mean I was because it was
[17:01] given
[17:03] right we believe that Adam was given
[17:07] eternal life don't we right according to
[17:10] Blasphemous names right right then if
[17:13] Adam was given eternal life then it
[17:15] means it was time he didn't have it
[17:18] right you say what but but down in there
[17:22] there was a little seed of eternal life
[17:24] there's where the point is see a little
[17:26] seed of eternal life
[17:30] life and that changes your whole entire
[17:34] thought when you start dealing with the
[17:37] seed all
[17:39] right now think about what I'm
[17:42] saying by for knowledge we can go back
[17:47] past any point of what we would think of
[17:52] predetermining because we can go back
[17:53] into the very Mind Of God
[17:56] Amen and we can see that God had
[18:01] children he had all of his attributes
[18:04] right amen right you remember all those
[18:07] quotes he had all of his attributes
[18:09] before he ever started he didn't gain an
[18:11] attribute coming this way he displayed
[18:14] the attributes coming this way right he
[18:16] always was a Healer he always was a
[18:19] savior well then he always had in his
[18:23] mind that he was going to bring forth
[18:26] his children right
[18:29] he didn't start thinking about it
[18:34] somewhere so you're limiting God he said
[18:37] well brother Dale then if you think that
[18:39] way it it it looks like there was
[18:41] something of us back there the only part
[18:43] that was back there that I know of is
[18:46] eternal
[18:49] life and I had to receive that by a new
[18:54] birth and then I kept emphasizing a lot
[18:57] on that if we believe we come with
[18:58] eternal life then Jesus Christ never he
[19:01] died in
[19:03] vain God didn't have to die to release
[19:05] life to redeem you and I
[19:09] right but you see that's where people
[19:11] just take quotes
[19:13] right and they'll just quote quote quote
[19:16] quote
[19:17] quote and people get tied up into their
[19:20] thinking and and they don't know what
[19:22] the answer is amen right I believe that
[19:28] almighty
[19:30] God was one time self-existing
[19:34] amen all right which meant he existed
[19:38] alone right all right now but I believe
[19:42] the eternal life that he has always
[19:46] existed amen not had or have he is
[19:50] eternal life all right I I I look and
[19:54] I'll try to give it after a while but
[19:56] brother R talking about
[20:00] and you'll say a lot of time eternal
[20:01] life through Jesus Christ but he talking
[20:04] about the person of eternal
[20:08] life so I don't believe eternal life is
[20:10] what I don't believe we understand it I
[20:13] believe we think it's some
[20:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost well that's
[20:18] that's what it is isn't it if you're
[20:21] talking about the soul but you can have
[20:23] the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on
[20:25] your spirit every day of your life and d
[20:27] and to hell right is that the words of
[20:30] the Prophet all right so then we don't
[20:33] deal with
[20:35] that but if we ever have eternal life
[20:39] that eternal life always was eternal
[20:41] amen that's
[20:43] sensible see then putting it to the
[20:46] basis that if we can byy by The
[20:49] Prophet's message and and and the Bible
[20:51] and things we've been able to to back up
[20:54] into God's mind and see that God
[20:58] he dwelt
[21:01] alone but the prophet said he'll never
[21:04] dwell alone again right that's what I
[21:07] love why because his attributes are
[21:10] being displayed amen right and that's
[21:13] who we are right but brother Dale you
[21:15] don't think we was back there as people
[21:20] no I do not I do not believe in the
[21:24] Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of
[21:27] Souls
[21:29] I believe in pre-existence of eternal
[21:31] life amen
[21:34] amen not pre-existence of people we'll
[21:37] get to it when we get over that the
[21:39] prophet said it was not the person that
[21:42] come predestinated eternally from God
[21:44] but to seed our
[21:46] word so then the persons that we
[21:50] are that's the prophet where we Spirits
[21:52] he said no you would nothing you was in
[21:54] his mind and he said I gave you the
[21:56] quote he said not your
[21:58] being but to form or shape of the
[22:02] infinite
[22:04] God so I have no problems believing that
[22:08] the children of God are his very
[22:11] Offspring
[22:13] amen all right we don't believe in
[22:16] Eternal sunship right amen but we
[22:19] believe in Eternal godship amen amen you
[22:22] remember
[22:24] that I believe in an eternal godhead to
[22:28] Prophet
[22:29] says but not an eternal
[22:32] son all right so then I don't want to
[22:35] just be a
[22:36] son the way our terms of doing and
[22:39] speaking and now come on we've been
[22:41] through the
[22:43] message I know the Bible will talk about
[22:46] sons of God I know the Bible I know the
[22:48] prophet talking about sons of God but is
[22:50] that word son there is it meaning
[22:52] Eternal
[22:55] sunship come on cuz it can't be
[22:59] true but I believe the Eternal God was
[23:03] made manifest in human flesh that's
[23:06] right right the Eternal God was made
[23:10] manifest in human flesh called a son
[23:14] amen and see that person never had a
[23:17] beginning or never had an ending amen
[23:19] you hear Brother Rand on who is this
[23:21] mchz he said mesic had no beginning end
[23:24] he said but Jesus Christ had a
[23:26] beginning he said had a time that he
[23:28] started right amen he was a time when he
[23:31] was
[23:32] born but he said I don't believe in
[23:34] Eternal
[23:37] sunship I believe in Eternal godship
[23:39] amen God is the only one that's
[23:42] Eternal and we must have his own life
[23:45] that's why we don't believe in Hell
[23:46] being
[23:49] Eternal because if hell is eternal God
[23:52] would have to put his life into hell and
[23:54] that won't
[23:56] work
[23:58] even death and hell both will be
[24:02] destroyed in the Lake of Fire all right
[24:05] so we don't we don't wor with that part
[24:08] but now what predestinated in him are
[24:13] chosen in
[24:16] him not chosen of
[24:20] him you get it into
[24:23] predestination backing up P's
[24:26] predestination into four knowledge we
[24:28] can begin to determine then that that
[24:31] eternal life that we have by the new
[24:35] birth was just as Eternal as God is or
[24:38] is the the life of God and that's what
[24:41] makes us the children of
[24:46] God come on I'm I'm hitting these in for
[24:49] later on but the prophet said we did not
[24:51] become
[24:53] seed by the new
[24:56] birth
[24:59] right he said we were
[25:01] seed that's why we could be born again y
[25:06] all right so we got a lot to go on the
[25:07] seed when we get to it right so just
[25:10] hang
[25:11] on you say well I just don't understand
[25:13] what's your point of what you're saying
[25:15] my whole point of one thing that I
[25:16] preached for 17 sermons is one thing I
[25:21] do not
[25:23] believe that any part of you and I Body
[25:26] Spirit and soul
[25:28] came into the world Eternal amen that's
[25:31] right
[25:33] yeah the prophet would talk about a spot
[25:35] of eternal
[25:39] life there's a lot of difference in the
[25:41] spot of eternal life and the person of
[25:43] eternal life
[25:46] amen cuz see you're going to put eternal
[25:49] life in your soul and that's the same
[25:51] doctrine of the two Soul
[25:54] people amen yeah
[25:58] that Doctrine is older as I am
[26:02] nearly it's 40 some years ago and the
[26:05] man taught that if you could be born
[26:07] again you had two
[26:09] Souls one from God one from the
[26:13] devil amen and all you had to do was
[26:16] kill that old
[26:18] soul from the devil because that other
[26:21] Soul didn't need anything it always was
[26:26] eternal but if you was never going to be
[26:28] born again you only had one Soul coming
[26:30] from the devil well I told him then I
[26:32] said you're making the devil a
[26:37] Creator and the devil can't
[26:39] create he can't give you a soul he
[26:41] perverts the nature of your soul yes
[26:45] right that's why he must be Chast cast
[26:53] out all right then looking at it in the
[26:56] straight line of what we see we don't
[26:58] believe that people were back there we
[27:00] believe God existed alone amen I know
[27:03] I've told you this statement over and
[27:05] over I said you believe in
[27:07] predestination I was predestinated well
[27:10] then you just predestinated yourself out
[27:13] of
[27:14] existence because we've already shown by
[27:17] the prophet in the Bible you can go back
[27:19] to forn
[27:20] knowledge which is way back past
[27:24] predestination so if all you can go is
[27:26] predestination
[27:28] you're Ling
[27:31] somewhere because you're going to have
[27:33] to stay somewhere he predestinated
[27:36] you right I don't believe he
[27:39] predestinated us I believe we are him
[27:45] made
[27:46] manifest in another form called a bride
[27:49] called a Sons and Daughters of God
[27:51] called his offspring that's right
[27:55] amen and God knew whether not you'd want
[27:58] to be
[27:59] saved so we had it ready for us when we
[28:01] got
[28:05] here eternal life is a person amen this
[28:10] is not a thought or an idea or a concept
[28:12] A Doctrine eternal life is a person
[28:16] right and that's where most people know
[28:18] nothing about that they don't know
[28:19] anything about the person of God
[28:25] right well brother I I just believe what
[28:28] the prophet said well Keep On Believing
[28:34] it but keep on reading
[28:37] right and I'm not saying this but for
[28:39] one reason it's
[28:41] truth well the problem is is people
[28:44] trying to figure out what brother Brown
[28:45] is saying without
[28:47] following the channel that God sends
[28:51] which is a five-fold
[28:53] Ministry I don't need no five-fold
[28:55] Ministry I'll get it for myself go go
[28:57] right
[29:00] ahead you're going to get it all
[29:04] around just go
[29:06] ahead God sent a five-fold Ministry he
[29:10] predestinated a five-fold
[29:16] Ministry the B the five-fold ministry
[29:19] according to the Bible and the prophet
[29:21] is far the perfecting of the Saints
[29:23] right now I didn't write that
[29:28] but you know I believe it amen but I
[29:31] also believe it I'm not all of it I got
[29:34] a good understanding of that
[29:39] Bless but I believe I'm a part of it
[29:42] amen and I believe one
[29:47] thing I believe any fivefold Ministry
[29:52] person God has a word for you to
[29:56] bring
[29:58] right
[30:00] right well that's what Paul
[30:02] said Paul said the mystery who of I'm
[30:05] called his call was to bring the mystery
[30:08] of Jesus Christ to the people that's
[30:12] right a call is not a rooster crow into
[30:14] a mama call and daddy
[30:19] sent but
[30:21] predestination people trying to figure
[30:24] it out without having the gift
[30:28] to understand it
[30:30] by
[30:32] right you said well I don't have to
[30:34] depend on you no
[30:36] uhuh well because I'm not sent to you if
[30:38] you don't have to depend on
[30:41] me according to the Bible he said he
[30:43] gave some
[30:44] Apostles some prophets some evangelist
[30:47] some pastors and some teachers now
[30:49] according to the Bible that's what he
[30:50] said it would happen well he gave some
[30:52] but if you don't want it that's all
[30:55] right you it won't stop me but it could
[30:59] stop you were you trying to scare me
[31:03] scare
[31:04] what yeah you can't scare
[31:08] people it done too far to be try to
[31:11] scare them used to be a day that you
[31:13] could preach against sin and people
[31:16] would weep their way to the
[31:18] altar now you preach against sin and
[31:21] they set turn life at
[31:26] you
[31:30] but
[31:32] listen see then
[31:36] predestination if we just believe in
[31:38] predestination we're stopping the
[31:41] understanding of the truth of of God's
[31:43] word
[31:47] amen because predestination means the
[31:50] time to
[31:53] start right a predetermined fact actor
[31:57] something to
[31:58] start well I'm talking about something
[32:01] that we'll get to it Sunday that they
[32:04] said to brother brandom said are you
[32:07] still preaching on
[32:09] that let's see new fangle religion or
[32:13] something he said no he said I'm
[32:17] preaching the oldest
[32:19] religion that ever was that's right he
[32:23] said I'm preaching about the morning
[32:25] Stars saying together and the sons of
[32:28] God shouted for Joy he said I'm way back
[32:30] before the world ever begun in what I
[32:35] believe so I believe that you and I are
[32:38] a part of God amen
[32:42] amen Jesus was the fullness of the
[32:44] godhead bodily you and I cannot be but
[32:47] the prophet said God is not complete
[32:49] without you amen so if we have eternal
[32:54] life then God is not complete without
[32:57] that eternal life would you show me how
[32:59] that eternal life in any person can
[33:04] reject the word of God
[33:09] right no but you know what people say
[33:12] well I just don't like your
[33:14] attitude I I can't prove you wrong but I
[33:17] just don't like your
[33:20] attitude don't worry about
[33:22] it my attitude has nothing to do with
[33:25] you God will judge my
[33:29] attitude I have to answer to him for my
[33:32] attitude but I don't have to answer to
[33:34] him for the word amen the word stands
[33:37] true
[33:39] amen going back then to see
[33:43] predestinated in his
[33:48] thinking the prophet said we were only
[33:51] only in his thinking I gave that to you
[33:52] the other day only in his
[33:55] thinking well why do you want to go back
[33:59] why not stay where we're at and let
[34:02] eternal life be a part of us
[34:08] here see I don't believe we're
[34:12] understanding the
[34:15] message it can't be contrary to the
[34:18] word there's no
[34:20] way and when Paul would say those who he
[34:23] for know he did predestinate that saws
[34:26] that yeah amen predestination wasn't
[34:30] first for knowledge was first
[34:35] amen but even for knowledge of our
[34:37] existence upon
[34:41] Earth there's still a way on back behind
[34:44] our that we've been
[34:49] covering you see church that's why I
[34:51] believe it and I've told you and I put
[34:52] it out here now in front of you I
[34:55] believe if you have eternal
[35:00] life that you receive that eternal life
[35:03] by the new birth amen yes
[35:07] sir and that eternal
[35:10] life is the life of almighty God amen
[35:14] amen and that eternal life is the
[35:17] children of
[35:19] God that he had in
[35:22] him now
[35:24] listen that he had in him
[35:27] or was a part of him when he was
[35:30] self-existing
[35:31] amen now now now that can't be now
[35:35] well you haven't been listening to what
[35:38] I've
[35:40] preached that eternal
[35:44] life is part of the self-existing that's
[35:48] right where do we get to where the
[35:50] morning star sang together sons of God
[35:52] shouted for Joy the prophet said they
[35:55] shouted and seeing the Plan of
[36:01] Redemption that's what he
[36:06] says we better lay down our thinking and
[36:08] back up in to the prophet's message you
[36:11] know and his thinking and doing and
[36:13] believing it and realized it being an
[36:16] attribute of
[36:20] God means I'm part of
[36:23] God but now that's just too much being
[36:26] God well now you tell me what the Bible
[36:28] said the Bible say you're the sons of
[36:30] God he says you're
[36:33] Gods
[36:35] right hey we have to explain it then
[36:37] don't we we're little
[36:39] Gods because none of us are the fullness
[36:43] right but Jesus was the
[36:46] fullness but you put all of us
[36:50] together and we're join ours with him
[36:52] the Bible say ours of God and join ours
[36:56] with Jesus Jesus
[36:59] Christ whatever he has we have it amen
[37:03] that's why in the body of Christ the
[37:06] prophet of God could cover all the
[37:08] five-fold ministry you agree with that
[37:11] right he could be all of those things to
[37:13] the bride of
[37:15] Christ but none of us can be those
[37:19] things I don't care who the five4
[37:21] ministry person is if you try to push
[37:23] yourself to the point of trying to make
[37:25] yourself greater than anybody else in
[37:27] the fivefold ministry other than the
[37:29] gift of what you
[37:32] got look what you're
[37:37] doing that's Satan's
[37:40] tactics yeah but but brother Dale don't
[37:43] you think Satan could get in and and and
[37:45] try to make you get to the point do you
[37:47] think that you're
[37:53] something well don't you you think
[37:56] you're
[38:00] something is there any
[38:02] problem don't you think that you are a
[38:05] child of God right
[38:08] amen then you are something right
[38:15] am
[38:17] predestinated in
[38:22] him what would it be
[38:25] then not you're being
[38:28] here with the shape and form at the
[38:32] infinite
[38:34] God we wasn't back there except the
[38:38] eternal life that we now
[38:42] have that eternal life was back there
[38:45] before the world amen amen cuz that's
[38:48] the life of God
[38:52] right I asked you a question or two
[38:55] during the series up to work where we're
[38:58] at I ask you where we chosen of him or
[39:01] in
[39:04] him were we chosen were we chosen by him
[39:07] or or in him which way is
[39:13] it you see then that way we can look at
[39:16] the truth of the word of
[39:18] God and say thank you
[39:21] Lord I now know who I
[39:25] am I'm going child of
[39:27] God a child of God is just like Jesus
[39:31] was a child of
[39:33] God Jesus wasn't a second person third
[39:36] person or even the first person he was
[39:39] the
[39:44] person he was almighty God made manifest
[39:47] in flesh amen what are You and
[39:52] I by the new birth we are almighty God
[39:55] made manifest best in human
[40:01] flesh you understand what I've been
[40:03] driving at for months and months
[40:05] now look at it eternal
[40:13] life and
[40:16] believing that we are his
[40:21] children his
[40:25] children your children are not somebody
[40:27] else's
[40:30] children your children are
[40:34] yours they're part of
[40:38] you that's just a scratch in the surface
[40:42] of a thought for being a child of
[40:45] God that's why those Old Testament
[40:47] Saints I've taught you those Old
[40:49] Testament Saints never had eternal life
[40:51] in their soul as a new
[40:55] birth
[40:58] because Jesus Christ had not died yet to
[41:01] release the life
[41:04] right they were under the blood of bulls
[41:06] and goats and that blood of bulls and
[41:07] goats couldn't bring them eternal
[41:12] life but on the day of Pentecost eternal
[41:15] life came into being amen as the
[41:18] children of God
[41:20] Amen his
[41:25] offspring
[41:28] all right I got one but I'll have to
[41:34] paraphrase it
[41:37] because I left my notepad laying at home
[41:41] on the desk and I've been looking at it
[41:43] today and I was asked a
[41:46] question I'll cover it and then we'll
[41:49] get to the question so get the
[41:52] microphone and and I want you to comment
[41:56] and questions and
[41:59] everything we don't get to we'll just
[42:01] take it up
[42:03] Sunday but I was asked a question about
[42:06] eternal
[42:08] life and said if we have eternal life by
[42:10] the new
[42:12] birth you know and I believe we
[42:16] do said then what about the life of the
[42:19] foolish
[42:21] virgins do they receive eternal
[42:25] life
[42:27] I believe the foolish virgins at the
[42:29] white Throne judgment will receive
[42:32] eternal life
[42:34] am but they have nothing to do with
[42:38] receiving it right it's simply an
[42:40] impartation of eternal life because of
[42:43] what they done or didn't do or whatever
[42:45] you know
[42:47] right and those Old Testament Saints
[42:50] will come up and have to be judged and
[42:52] they'll receive eternal
[42:55] life
[42:56] if they've been
[42:58] true but that'll never make
[43:02] them what the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[43:06] amen even the 144,000 that receive
[43:09] eternal life while here on
[43:15] Earth they will never be part of the
[43:17] Bride
[43:20] right that's the wonderful
[43:23] part you said wases that make us
[43:25] something brother Dale we it it just
[43:27] makes us look now we don't if you think
[43:29] it makes you something to look down on
[43:31] somebody else you don't have eternal
[43:34] life I have no problem with saying that
[43:36] I don't care who you are me or who if
[43:39] you look down on somebody else to think
[43:41] you're greater than they are no it is he
[43:44] that hath made us and not we ourselves
[43:46] we are his people and the Sheep of his
[43:48] Pastor whatever he is I mean yeah
[43:51] whatever he is I
[43:53] am those foolish virgins
[43:56] have to have have to get eternal life
[43:58] one
[43:59] day all
[44:03] right the question went on was asking
[44:05] about
[44:07] the you know would the world become
[44:11] Eternal I believe it
[44:13] will you can argue that point backwards
[44:16] and forth but it's all right I believe
[44:19] this world one day will be made Eternal
[44:22] also because my body came out of it and
[44:25] I know my body be made
[44:27] Eternal and I believe this world will be
[44:29] made Eternal that's why the future home
[44:33] can come down upon on as the prophet
[44:36] calls it in the future home he saw this
[44:39] holy city the New Jerusalem descending
[44:42] like a com like a A or a dove coming out
[44:47] of Heaven settling Upon A redeemed
[44:51] entire Earth
[44:54] amen he came up on Jesus Christ to
[44:58] redeem that body amen took three and 1/2
[45:01] years but it was finished in the
[45:02] resurrection and the the Ascension and
[45:05] the
[45:06] change all right it was made
[45:08] Eternal because his body was not Eternal
[45:11] while he was here on Earth
[45:14] right then this world will be made
[45:17] Eternal I believe that because of the
[45:19] scriptures in in Isaiah 65:17 says for
[45:23] behold I create new heavens and a new
[45:26] Earth and the former things shall not be
[45:30] remembered not come into
[45:31] mine I
[45:35] create new heavens and new earth all
[45:38] right Revelations 21 and5 says and he
[45:42] that sat upon the throne said
[45:44] behold I make all things new
[45:50] amen coming to eternal life what a
[45:53] beautiful place will it be
[45:59] the
[46:00] Millennium won't be an eternal
[46:05] World it will be a time element creature
[46:09] amen it would be swept off and
[46:12] cleansed Satan will be bound for a
[46:14] thousand years but the Millennium it
[46:17] won't be Eternal in time it'll be in
[46:20] time that's why it is the Millennium and
[46:22] that's why it's in the seventh day
[46:24] because we have a millenum to prove the
[46:26] sin curses gone because the Bible back
[46:29] in the beginning said in the day you eat
[46:31] thereof that day you'll die so there's
[46:33] going to be a thousand years to lived
[46:35] upon Earth by somebody but just remember
[46:38] it won't be me and you because we're
[46:40] already made
[46:42] Eternal all
[46:45] right you see then when it's all
[46:47] finished then this world gets a fiery
[46:50] baptism to be cleanse off everything
[46:54] amen
[46:56] and down comes the future home
[47:00] Amen to a redeemed
[47:04] Earth you said well well what about the
[47:06] Kings coming in and out well that's no
[47:08] problem is
[47:10] it now you can argue a point or think
[47:13] about wondering if the kings of the
[47:15] Earth would be Eternal I have no
[47:18] problems believing they will
[47:22] be maybe you don't that's all right
[47:27] and I believe that they will
[47:29] be at the white Throne given eternal
[47:34] life cuz it says there to White Throne
[47:36] enter you into the joys of the Lord
[47:37] prepared prepared for you before the
[47:39] foundation of the world that's even
[47:41] speaking to the foolish virgins and
[47:43] things it looks so close until it looks
[47:45] so much like it and we used to think
[47:47] that we'd have to stand before the white
[47:48] Throne
[47:51] right but it's not so amen but the Bride
[47:55] is a CH chosen people royal priesthood
[47:58] chosen generation remember
[48:00] Sunday offering spiritual
[48:03] sacrifices or eternal
[48:07] life all will be made new you say well
[48:10] it's just made
[48:11] new you know well that's that's what I
[48:15] said that's that's what you think all
[48:19] right but I think when it's made new it
[48:22] be made
[48:24] eternal
[48:26] cu the prophet said there won't be no
[48:27] Mounds on it for a body that's been
[48:30] buried there won't be no sin there won't
[48:32] be no uh serpent to be afraid
[48:36] of even in the Millennium a child put
[48:39] his hand on the hold of an asp and not
[48:41] be worried about it you know a deadly
[48:44] scorpions and things but Satan will be
[48:47] bound for that thousand years but what
[48:49] about when Satan is annihilated
[48:54] amen you ask me I tell you my opinion
[48:57] that I
[48:59] believe one day all will be made
[49:02] new
[49:04] amen if it's so beautiful in the
[49:06] Millennium until it'll be a great thing
[49:08] what about in the future
[49:11] H what about
[49:15] it then I was asked the question in the
[49:17] Bible study and I answered is as honest
[49:20] as I
[49:22] could said where was God at
[49:26] you know before before the world before
[49:29] everything see I believe he was
[49:34] real I don't believe he was just like
[49:36] the wind blowing
[49:39] just I believe he was
[49:41] real I believe he was a whole lot more
[49:43] real than we're real that's
[49:46] right and why couldn't you say well he
[49:48] was back there in the future
[49:52] home no problem but I'm not saying
[49:55] that's a Doctrine that's an
[49:57] idea he lives
[50:00] somewhere the Bible says Heaven is my
[50:02] throne and Earth is my foot stol that's
[50:04] it see I mean he he he lived somewhere
[50:07] he was
[50:08] real cuz it wasn't a time that he come
[50:11] into
[50:16] existence he's
[50:19] real eternal life then to me is a
[50:22] wonderful thing am to think about living
[50:26] right
[50:28] here see people say well the sun Stood
[50:32] Still and this that and the other know
[50:38] well this is going to be the center of
[50:40] the universe cuz I think it is
[50:42] anyway the Earth is the center of the
[50:45] universe I don't care what science
[50:47] says because this is where God is going
[50:49] to dwell with his people that's right
[50:51] well that would be the center of the
[50:52] universe it wouldn't make no better what
[50:53] no matter what a universe was
[50:56] if it's where God
[51:01] is see God is
[51:05] real I believe he's a
[51:08] person the person that's
[51:11] right whole whole lot more real than you
[51:14] and I
[51:16] amen if a drunk would run into a gun to
[51:19] get away from a pink elephant that he
[51:21] sees in his
[51:23] mind how much more do you think that you
[51:25] and I would see God Jesus said one day
[51:28] he said if you've seen me you've seen
[51:30] the father
[51:34] amen who's got a question there was a
[51:37] couple of thoughts it's questional
[51:41] part be about eternal life who's got a
[51:45] question who'll be number
[51:52] one got a comment little on the
[51:58] question or could it
[52:00] be or a sister Susan I'm asking for so
[52:04] and
[52:06] so you
[52:09] know we'd get into that in the Bible
[52:11] study a lot she'll say so and so wants
[52:13] to know you know well that's fine we get
[52:18] the
[52:20] question any comments any thoughts
[52:24] questions
[52:34] s it says that God knew I wanted to be
[52:36] saved and he had it there for me the
[52:40] it was that the predestinated
[52:44] word no what now you go back go turn God
[52:48] knew that I wanted to be saved and so he
[52:51] had it here for me right and I'm
[52:53] wondering if that's that predestined
[52:56] that Eternal Word
[52:59] sure that's how that's how I had to come
[53:03] to be saved I had to hear word
[53:05] first he knew you'd want to be saved so
[53:08] he had eternal life for
[53:12] you he had eternal life for you and he
[53:15] had a word everybody's got a word I
[53:17] believe in that why I didn't want to get
[53:19] into word and Seed because that's
[53:21] messages but I believe every person I
[53:24] believe you got a word you have got
[53:28] something to make manifest right
[53:33] right Prophet said every age had a
[53:38] word you remember a few weeks ago maybe
[53:41] a month or so ago I mentioned that the
[53:43] Lord had showed me something about the
[53:44] change and Rapture and I said it'll be
[53:47] related we'll get to it eventually and I
[53:49] said you just remember Martin Luther
[53:51] probably preached on
[53:53] justification many many times
[53:55] times but one day it was made real amen
[54:01] right the prophet said when the bride
[54:03] realizes who she is and what she's here
[54:06] for said she'll be
[54:09] gone so if we realize where the word
[54:13] s not just letters on a
[54:17] page because that wasn't what was in the
[54:19] Bible to start with it's not letters on
[54:22] a page it's people right
[54:26] those people are those
[54:30] letters we are the word amen what arm
[54:33] and devil is not in the Bible no he said
[54:35] but what would take place when arm and
[54:37] devil would be on earth said that puts
[54:40] arm and devil in the
[54:42] Bible that what you talking
[54:45] about I have another one Satan is bound
[54:49] by
[54:50] circumstances
[54:52] um do you think that he will be roaming
[54:56] in the Millennium as he did in the
[54:58] garden but because the people all have
[55:01] the new birth in the
[55:04] Millennium he doesn't he doesn't have
[55:07] any control
[55:10] on okay so we'll have to clarify point
[55:13] so everybody's in the Millennium won't
[55:15] have the new
[55:16] birth all
[55:18] right and everybody said the Millennium
[55:21] W be part of the Bride that's right your
[55:23] uh 144,000 would be the Millennium I
[55:25] believe your Old Testament Jews as we
[55:28] call them the select of God will be in
[55:31] the
[55:31] Millennium right but then there'll be a
[55:33] heathen in the
[55:35] Millennium and there'll be a gospel to
[55:37] the Heathen in the Millennium right and
[55:40] that way I just don't believe everybody
[55:42] in the Millennium will be Eternal but I
[55:44] believe Satan is bound as the prophet
[55:46] said by Chain of circumstances he said
[55:49] he won't have anybody to work through
[55:52] right right you would say well is he
[55:54] wandering around or what is he
[55:56] doing him wondering around right now he
[55:58] can run all over he can run around me a
[56:00] thousand times it won't bother me long
[56:02] as he stays in that Dimension I'm in
[56:04] this one right right that don't bother
[56:09] me so you won't be able to make contact
[56:11] he will be uh taken away from the
[56:14] ability to
[56:16] pervert through the mind of mankind is
[56:19] way to say in the
[56:22] mind the mind of mankind will be totally
[56:25] pure amen even though it will be a
[56:29] person that's not Eternal as we'd say
[56:32] right but there'll
[56:34] be no way Satan can contact
[56:39] you he won't be able to argue with you
[56:42] amen he's bound away from us so what
[56:45] does it matter if he's in another
[56:47] dimension which is a few feet
[56:51] away doing what he wants to but it's not
[56:54] a a chain of circum I mean it's not a
[56:56] log chain it's a chain of circumstance
[56:58] there's nothing for him to work
[57:00] through you realize if you and I come to
[57:04] this to the right thing of sitting in a
[57:07] church listening to somebody preach the
[57:09] gospel you realize if we're locked in on
[57:12] what that person is saying and God is
[57:14] speaking to us through them that Satan
[57:17] has no ability that's
[57:22] right he can try all he wants to
[57:25] but he's cut out I believe the Bride of
[57:29] Jesus
[57:31] Christ will come to a place that like
[57:33] the prophet said he said
[57:36] Satan won't have nothing to do with
[57:40] you now he says that before the
[57:44] change said can we live so close to God
[57:46] to Satan he said
[57:50] yes that's right here
[57:53] right but you know our problem is is we
[57:58] we uh you
[57:59] know we get locked in on everything
[58:04] else and that's the reason I like to sit
[58:06] on the front
[58:08] row you know Butz I I don't like to see
[58:12] everything that's going on from the back
[58:14] row to the front right because it's
[58:16] distractive to my thinking so I'd rather
[58:18] sit on the front row amen yeah because I
[58:22] got a bad enough problem like it is you
[58:25] know I'm human right and I just don't
[58:27] want him to be able to work through me
[58:30] right see I realize some people have to
[58:32] sit with the back because of their
[58:33] children taking care of that's not not
[58:35] throwing off on nobody just telling it
[58:38] as a point I believe the bride of Christ
[58:41] before we go out of
[58:43] here we'll come to the basis that she
[58:45] won't be listening to the
[58:48] devil sir I believe that's taking place
[58:51] now that's
[58:53] right now I didn't say the devil
[58:55] couldn't talk to you I said you won't be
[58:57] listening to him right you remember a
[59:00] time when you wondered about the Trinity
[59:02] where it was right or not what was that
[59:05] the devil and
[59:06] beaten but now that's all settled right
[59:10] there's no way Satan could come in here
[59:12] and bring a sermon and he could bring
[59:15] people in it was dead right and they
[59:18] could be raised from the dead you think
[59:20] it would cause you and I to go back to a
[59:23] trinity no
[59:26] that's done sealed
[59:28] out go to we're sealed in is that what
[59:31] you told me anything else one more okay
[59:34] predestination looks to Destiny that
[59:37] can't really be preached on can I say
[59:41] that Vice over predestination looks
[59:43] toward Destiny but we can't preach on
[59:46] that cuz we don't know we can't go any
[59:49] further than brother brandom did
[59:52] with glad you said it that way
[59:56] I don't believe we'll go any further
[59:57] than brother
[59:59] brandham I don't believe that but you
[1:00:03] know what I do
[1:00:04] believe I believe we have been shown the
[1:00:07] future
[1:00:09] right we know what will be in the future
[1:00:12] home we know what will be in the
[1:00:14] Millennium which is a
[1:00:16] predestinated time over under away from
[1:00:18] us a time that will transpire we know
[1:00:21] what'll take place isn't that wonderful
[1:00:25] to be the Bride of Jesus
[1:00:28] Christ this message folks is not a
[1:00:30] Doctrine to
[1:00:32] me this message is God revealing
[1:00:37] himself it's not just a an idea or a
[1:00:42] concept it's Jesus Christ now speaking
[1:00:46] to his people things that he could never
[1:00:49] speak before that's right yes sir
[1:00:53] amen our mind is becoming unmodded I
[1:00:56] guess you'd say the word for it it's
[1:00:58] becoming straightened out enough to
[1:01:00] where we can at least think
[1:01:02] sensibly cuz that's the way I
[1:01:08] do I take something and I look at it and
[1:01:10] I say Well it can't be this cuz that
[1:01:13] won't work it can't be that cuz that
[1:01:16] won't
[1:01:18] work
[1:01:20] yeah well after a while I I'm taking the
[1:01:24] what you call all that where you you're
[1:01:25] you're canceling out things and I'm
[1:01:27] finally come to a place of saying well I
[1:01:29] got it down to two so now all I got to
[1:01:32] do is wait until the Lord show me which
[1:01:34] one of them's
[1:01:35] right CU I done took away what it can't
[1:01:38] be they can't be an eternal
[1:01:42] hell right
[1:01:45] right they can't be an eternal
[1:01:48] devil right they can't be an eternal
[1:01:53] sunship Xing them
[1:01:58] off they could be an eternal
[1:02:02] godhead and they can be an eternal
[1:02:06] godship I believe both of them's
[1:02:09] right I'm not trying to zero out which
[1:02:12] one of them is right I believe both of
[1:02:14] them's right do you understand what I'm
[1:02:16] saying church I wish I could get into
[1:02:19] words what is in my mind to try to tell
[1:02:22] people you realize we have the devil's
[1:02:30] answer I know what the prophet's talking
[1:02:32] about there where he said the Risen Lord
[1:02:33] Jesus Christ but that's what I'm talking
[1:02:36] about the Risen Lord Jesus Christ Living
[1:02:38] in you and I amen is the devil's
[1:02:43] answer the thing sister Gil it used to
[1:02:45] be confusing they're not as confusing
[1:02:53] anymore is that what you talking
[1:02:56] anything else all right who'll be
[1:03:02] next anybody else got a
[1:03:04] question
[1:03:06] comment Sister Sister
[1:03:11] kale I'm glad the Lord ask your own
[1:03:14] husband so I ask him a lot
[1:03:17] of this has been a wonderful series um I
[1:03:21] I mean it has just God has just shown me
[1:03:24] so much all of it the only thing that I
[1:03:27] that I'm wondering about I know we don't
[1:03:29] believe that we were bodies running back
[1:03:32] like I want but when somebody says the
[1:03:35] word pre-existence what comes to your
[1:03:39] mind to most people that say
[1:03:42] pre-existence it literally comes to my
[1:03:44] mind about bodies and things because
[1:03:46] that's where most people want their
[1:03:48] pre-existence is to be right some kind
[1:03:51] of a
[1:03:52] tangibility uh whatever you want to call
[1:03:54] call it if they wanted to move it into
[1:03:56] theophanes or whatever some kind of a
[1:03:58] bodies I believe a lot of people when
[1:04:00] they're saying pre-existence means
[1:04:03] pre-existence they believe they were you
[1:04:06] know what does it mean to you to me it
[1:04:08] means Eternal
[1:04:10] God is the only one that could
[1:04:14] pre-exist the eternal life that you have
[1:04:17] by the new birth is the only possible
[1:04:19] way that you could pre-exist but he was
[1:04:22] the only preexist exactly were we in his
[1:04:25] thoughts then right so we were all I can
[1:04:30] see how they people get confused
[1:04:32] though they want to make it something
[1:04:35] right that's all I want see you remember
[1:04:37] the message I said one day I was talking
[1:04:38] about and I said the ego see the ego of
[1:04:41] mankind whether it be Body Spirit that
[1:04:44] things
[1:04:45] what's it's tormenting
[1:04:48] people they want to be
[1:04:51] something I was the first one that said
[1:04:53] this
[1:04:55] as he
[1:04:56] goes what does it matter who says
[1:05:00] it the prophets already said
[1:05:03] it and God said it before he said
[1:05:07] it so we go back to the Eternal
[1:05:12] God and sister I believe that the
[1:05:16] eternal life that you have is not to
[1:05:18] just say we use terms as a part of God
[1:05:21] but how big is it you you can't do that
[1:05:26] it's a part of God's own
[1:05:29] life we go way back
[1:05:33] exactly we do I agree with you I'm
[1:05:36] trying to get us to see that that's the
[1:05:39] way back behind
[1:05:40] predestination that's what I've tried to
[1:05:42] get us to
[1:05:44] see that we go back past predestination
[1:05:47] predestination is not even in the
[1:05:49] picture predestination is what we're
[1:05:51] going to take up in in we'll have to
[1:05:54] take one or more message or two then we
[1:05:56] going to start
[1:05:58] predestination Destiny
[1:06:03] determined but we're walking our
[1:06:05] predestination into our destiny
[1:06:08] exactly exactly right I believe that go
[1:06:13] ahead go ahead is this thing is
[1:06:17] this Lord have mercy you know things go
[1:06:21] through your mind and and uh you know
[1:06:24] there's quotes quotes quotes and there's
[1:06:26] things I've read and things I think I've
[1:06:28] read and things I've heard people
[1:06:31] say but I you know I can't remember
[1:06:34] whether they true or not but did Brother
[1:06:37] B
[1:06:38] say when a bride realizes who she is
[1:06:41] she'll speak a world in
[1:06:43] existence and go live on
[1:06:47] it you're putting two quotes together
[1:06:51] okay well what did he say that's what he
[1:06:54] said but it's two
[1:06:56] quotes when the bride realizes who she
[1:06:58] is you know and what she's here for
[1:07:01] she'll be gone all right then there's
[1:07:03] another quote that says when the Bride
[1:07:05] Comes to the point he said if it wasn't
[1:07:07] for the god withholding from you and I a
[1:07:11] bar he said we would speak a world into
[1:07:14] existence and go live on it well see
[1:07:16] that's putting many many quotes and you
[1:07:19] know Jesus told him he says I go to
[1:07:21] prepare a place for you
[1:07:25] and it also talks about swear not by
[1:07:27] Heaven nor by Earth because Earth is his
[1:07:30] foot
[1:07:31] stol and that's what I walk around in
[1:07:34] you know and when he says things like
[1:07:37] that and the the real problem we I think
[1:07:42] we have today especially with people
[1:07:44] that don't understand uh or don't have
[1:07:47] your understanding or whatever is that
[1:07:50] when you talk about the creator of the
[1:07:53] universe
[1:07:54] verse living in your soul exactly then
[1:07:58] the first thought is well who do you
[1:08:00] think you are see and what you talking
[1:08:04] about the egos a while ago you know and
[1:08:07] to say that that doesn't that doesn't
[1:08:09] bother me to to say that it's ego wise
[1:08:12] or whatever like that but uh I don't say
[1:08:16] a lot of things because because people's
[1:08:19] going to say that right you know but you
[1:08:22] know when he said yeah you speak a world
[1:08:25] into existence when you come to that
[1:08:27] place that you can speak a world into
[1:08:30] existence what does that make
[1:08:33] you makes you the creator of God
[1:08:38] right but it just don't make you all of
[1:08:40] them no but still but still in all see
[1:08:44] he uh we were talking today sharing with
[1:08:48] Richard a little bit about I had a and I
[1:08:52] still do have a problem I talk with
[1:08:53] people and they say God this God that
[1:08:56] and God this and I said well what God
[1:08:58] you talking
[1:09:00] about and so I ask people I say uh if
[1:09:03] you had to
[1:09:05] Define almighty
[1:09:08] God uh what word would you use and
[1:09:11] you've heard me say this before and the
[1:09:14] word's
[1:09:15] Creator you know and and when and when
[1:09:19] brother bandham
[1:09:21] says when she realizes who she is is
[1:09:24] she'll speak a word into existence when
[1:09:27] she realizes that the baptism of Holy
[1:09:30] Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ and it's
[1:09:33] not you speaking no no when we realize
[1:09:37] that
[1:09:40] no but it's coming out exactly but it is
[1:09:43] you speaking and he's gone he ain't
[1:09:45] going to speak it without you he's gone
[1:09:46] to prepare a place for me right he's
[1:09:49] preparing this thing right here exactly
[1:09:52] to live eternally exactly
[1:09:54] this is a powerful thing right but see I
[1:09:58] got I got people that of course I I just
[1:10:01] don't hang with message people I hang
[1:10:04] with with uh
[1:10:07] Mormons
[1:10:09] alcoholics drug
[1:10:11] addicts uh you name it you know I hang
[1:10:14] with them and when you talk to them you
[1:10:18] have to talk to them on their level sure
[1:10:21] that they can understand what you're
[1:10:22] saying sure
[1:10:24] and the only way you going to get you
[1:10:25] going to be able to do that is get out
[1:10:27] there and do it yeah
[1:10:31] sure but that we're coming I I I believe
[1:10:34] we're coming to a
[1:10:36] place amen I do am and you know if I say
[1:10:40] things that offend
[1:10:42] people and what have you but I I see
[1:10:45] things and I believe it's him showing
[1:10:49] me and and
[1:10:52] uh
[1:10:54] I don't want to get in anybody's way
[1:10:56] yeah so you know if I say things that
[1:10:59] doesn't seem right to you or whatever
[1:11:01] and you can't see what I'm talking about
[1:11:03] well you just forgive
[1:11:05] me so I'll let somebody else have some
[1:11:09] else to
[1:11:10] say who' be
[1:11:17] next you know that thing on the foolish
[1:11:19] virgin you talk about minut ago is the
[1:11:22] foolish virgins
[1:11:27] that goes along with whether you whether
[1:11:30] or not you can speak the world in
[1:11:31] existence or
[1:11:33] not see one of them one of them doesn't
[1:11:36] have they have they you know they've
[1:11:39] been saved they're they're they're
[1:11:41] they're virgins they're
[1:11:43] Christians they just don't have the
[1:11:46] allil they don't have the baptism of the
[1:11:49] Holy Ghost they don't have him living in
[1:11:51] their life exactly in their soul
[1:11:55] and uh you know
[1:11:58] appreciate Brother
[1:12:08] Gary uh one of the quotes that you read
[1:12:11] it referred to brother bandam referred
[1:12:13] to God as having a form and you know
[1:12:16] some other quotes as well he said he's a
[1:12:18] being he lives in a house he's not like
[1:12:19] the wind could you comment just for a
[1:12:22] minute on
[1:12:24] before there was a world molecule Angel
[1:12:27] he was self-existing
[1:12:29] Elohim if his form if he would have
[1:12:32] allowed that form to be seen what do you
[1:12:34] think that we'd be looking at as far as
[1:12:36] the form that God existed before
[1:12:38] anything else
[1:12:41] was no problem with
[1:12:43] me
[1:12:48] sorry I
[1:12:51] believe that if you could go back so
[1:12:53] some
[1:12:54] way and see what was back there I'm
[1:12:57] questioning that way
[1:12:59] see that's why I believe is
[1:13:02] real I believe you would
[1:13:04] see the person of Jesus
[1:13:09] Christ standing
[1:13:15] there see if I didn't believe it that
[1:13:17] way I'd have troubles with the
[1:13:19] scriptures the quotes maybe what we call
[1:13:22] scriptures is what brother randam said
[1:13:23] is you know sometimes it's not a
[1:13:25] Verbatim scripture but he said we were
[1:13:28] in him when he walked the shores of
[1:13:32] Galilee he said we preached in him he
[1:13:35] said we went to hell in
[1:13:37] him he said we was raised in
[1:13:42] him well if it doesn't stay personal to
[1:13:46] where he's real how are you going to
[1:13:48] have
[1:13:51] it and see then we wasn't little bitty
[1:13:54] spots sticking in
[1:13:58] Jesus because that's your flesh you're
[1:14:00] looking
[1:14:02] at we were the part of the life that he
[1:14:05] had all right
[1:14:08] now brother random said let me go a step
[1:14:13] further he
[1:14:15] said and it's on the predestination
[1:14:17] quotes if you heard me reading
[1:14:22] them he said we were just his attributes
[1:14:24] and things he
[1:14:26] said not her being like that i' say but
[1:14:29] he then he'd go on in a minute and he'd
[1:14:31] say like space gets the future on he
[1:14:33] said my body was in the
[1:14:37] earth when it was
[1:14:44] created now let me ask you a question
[1:14:46] then I love
[1:14:47] to turn it around
[1:14:50] on what do you think you would look like
[1:14:56] because we're not trying to put you back
[1:14:57] there as a person
[1:15:00] now we're trying to put you back there
[1:15:02] as a part of
[1:15:05] God but then let you come this way and
[1:15:09] develop into a
[1:15:12] body what if there had never been a
[1:15:19] fall don't you believe you would have
[1:15:21] come with a body
[1:15:25] where would that body have come
[1:15:27] from from the
[1:15:31] earth maybe not the seven 16 elements as
[1:15:34] the prophet would say not the same what
[1:15:36] is it brother Dean not the same um
[1:15:40] chemicals you see come from the original
[1:15:43] speaking of Let There
[1:15:45] Be I believe the body you're living in G
[1:15:48] GES right I believe the very body you're
[1:15:51] living in
[1:15:53] if you have the new
[1:15:55] birth is the body you're going to live
[1:15:57] in throughout
[1:16:00] eternity and that body would have been
[1:16:02] had there been no
[1:16:04] fall but yet that wouldn't have made him
[1:16:07] a savior and a Healer
[1:16:10] and cuz I'm not looking for another body
[1:16:14] see I'm looking for this body to be made
[1:16:18] new that's why the people in this
[1:16:20] message you check it out there's
[1:16:22] probably 50 % of the people believe
[1:16:24] you're going to get a new
[1:16:27] body after all brother random has said
[1:16:29] about it they still believe it because
[1:16:31] that's old Doctrine
[1:16:33] see I believe this body one day sir will
[1:16:39] be made
[1:16:40] Eternal now let me go another step and
[1:16:43] I'll stop then let somebody else the
[1:16:47] question if the word redeem is
[1:16:52] correct you're
[1:16:54] listening the word redeem means to go
[1:16:56] back where you come
[1:17:07] from don't you believe in Redemption of
[1:17:09] the
[1:17:20] body and who was that that Moses
[1:17:24] saw in the Cliff of the
[1:17:30] rock the
[1:17:32] theophany right which was the son of God
[1:17:35] which was the logos which was all the
[1:17:38] things the prophet is brought but who'
[1:17:40] it look
[1:17:43] like he said that back part of that man
[1:17:47] walked the shores of
[1:17:50] Galilee in Jesus Christ y
[1:17:54] God has a plan and a
[1:18:00] purpose but you're getting bordering on
[1:18:02] pre-existence brother Dale I'm not
[1:18:04] bordering on pre-existence I'm talking
[1:18:06] about pre-existence of eternal
[1:18:10] life not
[1:18:12] peoples of eternal life there was a time
[1:18:14] this world didn't
[1:18:20] exist but now it does who'll be next
[1:18:23] anything any more Brother
[1:18:25] Gary who'll be
[1:18:32] next
[1:18:37] anybody comments thoughts question
[1:18:40] brother
[1:18:43] dick
[1:18:45] El come
[1:18:51] up
[1:18:53] on on the theophany uh when I first
[1:18:56] studied on it and people preaching on
[1:18:58] and everything you know the scripture
[1:19:01] says if this Earthly body be dissolved
[1:19:04] we have one
[1:19:06] waiting and my question was that come to
[1:19:09] me now if we have one waiting when we
[1:19:13] die does a lost person have one waiting
[1:19:16] when they
[1:19:18] die so I come to find out that they do
[1:19:21] because brother said when when when
[1:19:25] Jesus and his theophany went to souls in
[1:19:28] prison to preach to them down there he
[1:19:31] said they were in their Theo exactly and
[1:19:34] what you said a minute ago just brought
[1:19:36] that up you know you know they're not
[1:19:40] going back to where they began because
[1:19:42] they're not redeemed can't
[1:19:45] be if they
[1:19:47] redeemed when when at the white Throne
[1:19:50] judgment when they're cast into hell
[1:19:54] that same body that they walking around
[1:19:56] here on this
[1:19:58] Earth they going to get that same body
[1:20:02] yeah but they're not redeemed sinner has
[1:20:06] to stand in the same body he lived in
[1:20:08] right I don't know whe that help anybody
[1:20:10] or not but that's just that's just what
[1:20:11] I
[1:20:13] see so you know you can't you can't cast
[1:20:16] that that bunch out there they got it
[1:20:20] they got a trip to make also amen it's
[1:20:23] all
[1:20:25] right I believe when Jesus Christ walked
[1:20:28] into the pits of
[1:20:31] hell that he looked just like he did
[1:20:34] with the body that was laying in that
[1:20:37] grave young man you know because of the
[1:20:40] fact of taking away age and thing
[1:20:43] but that was who he look
[1:20:47] like that's why I believe your soul is
[1:20:50] your
[1:20:51] theop
[1:20:53] because if I seen your soul right now it
[1:20:55] would look just exactly like you I CU
[1:20:57] you know what it'd be you I believe
[1:21:03] that who's
[1:21:13] next anybody else comments
[1:21:19] thoughts sister Anna
[1:21:29] this is a
[1:21:30] comment um when we on up a little
[1:21:35] closer uh brother grham said that Harry
[1:21:38] R asked for the right thing which was
[1:21:42] salvation of his two of her two boys and
[1:21:47] it just rang in my mind that the most
[1:21:49] important thing God is concerned with is
[1:21:52] for us to get eternal life and you know
[1:21:56] it said that they got baptized and
[1:21:58] followed God's provided way so there I
[1:22:02] didn't see anything to do with coming
[1:22:05] here with eternal life God I mean they
[1:22:07] had to come God's provided way right so
[1:22:10] God is more interested in us having
[1:22:13] eternal life because if you have the
[1:22:14] Holy Ghost you'll ask for the right
[1:22:16] thing like you
[1:22:18] said um another qu a question now what
[1:22:21] happens to deathbed
[1:22:24] conversions what happens what now people
[1:22:26] who like brother bram's Daddy
[1:22:30] he he got saved about an hour before he
[1:22:33] died you know
[1:22:35] he standing shaking hands death
[1:22:39] B don't they don't get baptized you know
[1:22:42] water and go through the whole journey
[1:22:45] what happens to those
[1:22:47] people uh I'm with brother random I
[1:22:50] believe in death bed confessions but
[1:22:52] I'll quote it with him it's very
[1:22:54] close and I don't want to depend on it
[1:22:58] but if it's
[1:23:00] genuine you know if it was
[1:23:03] genuine then what would be the
[1:23:05] difference in it and 40 years serving
[1:23:08] God right if you you know if if you was
[1:23:12] dying in in one second God come and give
[1:23:16] you eternal life you're just as Eternal
[1:23:17] as anybody that lived all their life so
[1:23:20] I believe in deathbed confessions I just
[1:23:23] don't believe in every one of them you
[1:23:25] know I believe in confessions I believe
[1:23:28] in all that but I just don't believe
[1:23:29] everybody has the right you know
[1:23:32] confessions and things and the
[1:23:34] possession with the
[1:23:36] confession and I do believe I believe
[1:23:38] people can can make it right just in a
[1:23:40] in a
[1:23:41] moment but we can't afford to
[1:23:45] wait that's something that you can't
[1:23:47] just say well I'll wait now you're in
[1:23:49] trouble cuz you can't afford to wait
[1:23:51] wondering about those people do they
[1:23:53] have eternal life I mean do they have
[1:23:56] the Holy
[1:23:58] Ghost if if that person the deathbed
[1:24:02] confession all right now you're going to
[1:24:04] get into a thought all right uh first
[1:24:09] that person could be just
[1:24:12] Justified all
[1:24:14] right and die and go
[1:24:17] on they could come up at the white
[1:24:19] Throne judgment and receive eternal life
[1:24:22] they don't have it here all right
[1:24:25] suppose you had a little time they could
[1:24:26] come to
[1:24:28] sanctification see they would have to go
[1:24:30] to the white Throne to receive it all
[1:24:33] but if that person right there in that
[1:24:34] deathbed confession could go through the
[1:24:37] fact of justification sanctification the
[1:24:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost just as
[1:24:41] Eternal as you
[1:24:46] are because it's eternal
[1:24:49] life but I said now you have to cure it
[1:24:51] because there's so many things
[1:24:54] see some people may be
[1:24:57] justified you know and die brother
[1:24:59] around said sure you're going to heaven
[1:25:02] see sure you're
[1:25:03] saved but he didn't say you in the bride
[1:25:06] see that's little different see you're
[1:25:10] going to have to go to the white
[1:25:12] throne and receive eternal
[1:25:15] life but sure you're
[1:25:19] saved why because you're believing on
[1:25:21] the Lord Jesus Christ yes
[1:25:23] sir that's where they T so much see you
[1:25:27] know you try to make a a straight thing
[1:25:30] on it it's hard to do because you got
[1:25:33] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:25:34] the Holy Ghost receive eternal life but
[1:25:36] you got a person that's just repentant
[1:25:38] and they become Justified you know
[1:25:40] repentance and if they die right in that
[1:25:43] state then they're going to go to heaven
[1:25:45] but they're not the
[1:25:47] bride because they didn't continue on
[1:25:49] they will get eternal life
[1:25:52] the to watch
[1:25:54] thr I mean that's the best I can
[1:25:57] do cuz that's just the way I see it
[1:26:00] that's why brother random you got so
[1:26:01] many things in brother rand's message
[1:26:03] that people are
[1:26:04] bypassing he said I believe you're born
[1:26:06] again and baptized into the
[1:26:13] body that's got a place to be put but
[1:26:16] honestly admit I don't understand yet
[1:26:18] all about words
[1:26:19] put uh I believe I do about
[1:26:21] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:26:24] of the Holy Ghost adoption Etc
[1:26:27] fine
[1:26:29] but everybody says Lord Lord ain't going
[1:26:31] to enter either so that's a different
[1:26:34] thing
[1:26:35] too I'm still learning
[1:26:37] too I appreciate the God doing it and
[1:26:41] you know what I'd like to do is listen
[1:26:42] to you
[1:26:43] talk you'd be surprised how many sermons
[1:26:45] I get listen to you
[1:26:48] talk cuz sometimes you answer my
[1:26:51] questions
[1:26:53] you said well I didn't know it
[1:26:55] well we get old there you don't know
[1:26:58] it is that that what you're talking
[1:27:00] about though okay anything
[1:27:03] else who'll be
[1:27:06] next say
[1:27:12] about uh you t a thief on the
[1:27:16] cross he made a confession there that
[1:27:20] they were they was getting a just reward
[1:27:22] for for their life right and admitted
[1:27:25] that he was the Lord because he called
[1:27:27] him Lord right he said remember me when
[1:27:31] I you you your kingdom is brought into
[1:27:36] effect he says this day th'll be with me
[1:27:38] in paradise and somewhere will receive
[1:27:41] eternal life cuz he was when Jesus went
[1:27:44] down there and and preach to that that
[1:27:47] group there see he was over here and
[1:27:50] when they resurrected he res resurrected
[1:27:52] they resurrected he was with them right
[1:27:55] now that's a that's a good type to to
[1:27:57] look to and I don't see how it could be
[1:28:00] brought any better than what you did
[1:28:01] just then because you can be
[1:28:05] justified in in in in a Christian and
[1:28:08] will receive eternal life somewh
[1:28:10] Justified and Sanctified in in
[1:28:12] receiveing but all that's up to God
[1:28:14] right and see he put he posted that on
[1:28:17] that cross right there and it showed
[1:28:20] that man he because he they both of them
[1:28:22] was reading on him to start with and he
[1:28:25] seen something he said he said now why
[1:28:28] are you doing this I mean to the other
[1:28:30] Thief he said why are you doing this
[1:28:32] this man's done nothing right see he I
[1:28:35] mean he's and then he turned to him he
[1:28:37] said Lord remember me when you come into
[1:28:40] your kingdom exactly so he he confessed
[1:28:42] that that was him and then Jesus gave it
[1:28:45] to him right there and and show he this
[1:28:48] was a death bed a Confessor right I mean
[1:28:51] I guarantee cuz he was he was hanging on
[1:28:53] the cross so you I thought I'd mention
[1:28:56] that but one other thing that I I just
[1:28:59] little something that I see
[1:29:02] because all the talking all the
[1:29:04] preaching rather that you've done it
[1:29:07] does something to me see I see that
[1:29:10] where he said Joshua parallels Ephesian
[1:29:14] Ephesian par Joshua he said
[1:29:17] election looks to for knowledge for
[1:29:20] knowledge looks to D Destiny looks to to
[1:29:24] uh me predestination looks to Destiny so
[1:29:27] I see by having the new birth that I
[1:29:31] have the very Fountain of for knowledge
[1:29:33] in my in my soul amen right and he and
[1:29:36] he shows me by a revelation that I am
[1:29:40] his elected exactly and that election
[1:29:43] goes by predestination back to the found
[1:29:46] before the foundation of the world where
[1:29:48] he put my name on the Lamb's Book of
[1:29:50] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:29:52] and this caught me down here and but I
[1:29:54] must see that I am God's elected and I
[1:29:57] see it for my soul exactly and this is
[1:30:00] where it's all happening here it's not
[1:30:02] off up here somewhere it's all happening
[1:30:05] in me and this is this is a this I'm
[1:30:08] kind of summing something up but you
[1:30:11] must see to to be in this change that
[1:30:15] you are God's elected and and all the
[1:30:18] way back to before because that that's
[1:30:20] the greatest mystery
[1:30:22] that I could even even think of how God
[1:30:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:30:27] before there was anything dwelt there
[1:30:30] and how he in his thoughts he could have
[1:30:33] two people now I'm just just you he
[1:30:35] could be the world and how he could know
[1:30:38] that he was going to create those two
[1:30:40] people and and and he knew what one of
[1:30:43] them would do and he would not make that
[1:30:47] person make one choice for him he
[1:30:50] wouldn't make him do it right but and he
[1:30:52] also wouldn't make this other person
[1:30:54] make a choice but he knew the choice for
[1:30:57] knowledge exactly he knew the choice and
[1:31:00] he was able to predestinate and from
[1:31:02] there by you seeing you you he is
[1:31:05] elected he can show you your
[1:31:07] predestination by his for knowledge and
[1:31:10] show you your destiny exactly amen thank
[1:31:13] you and I'm I'm I'll get to this Sunday
[1:31:16] I a going to say no more about it I'm
[1:31:17] just going to say I think we're pretty
[1:31:19] well down to the end of predestination
[1:31:22] right I think the destiny has been
[1:31:26] achieved amen right now we'll get to
[1:31:29] that Sunday but I think his Destiny has
[1:31:32] been achieved is a long travel but
[1:31:35] somewhere you're going to reach the end
[1:31:36] of that
[1:31:38] travel yep come together here who's
[1:31:43] next when Jesus died on the cross um
[1:31:47] brother brandham said that when they
[1:31:50] pierced him in the side that the the
[1:31:51] bride came out yet the bride went to
[1:31:55] hell with him so it's talking about the
[1:31:59] life CU that theophany was the eternal
[1:32:03] life that went to hell so it's talking
[1:32:06] about the life not the
[1:32:08] blood right because see it's like I said
[1:32:12] the other
[1:32:13] day when that life went out of Jesus
[1:32:17] Christ that eternal life that was the
[1:32:20] bride going out right okay cuz that was
[1:32:23] his
[1:32:24] children but yet there's a connection to
[1:32:26] this
[1:32:27] flesh so he had to put that spear in
[1:32:30] there to bring the bride
[1:32:32] out what out into being not out as
[1:32:36] a you know bringing it out it's into
[1:32:40] being you know we're we're
[1:32:43] here we are his bride on earth right
[1:32:46] we're not as bright up in heaven we're
[1:32:48] on Earth so that blood would have to run
[1:32:51] out here see to show the bride where
[1:32:54] she's
[1:32:55] at she's not up
[1:32:59] there those Saints is just 20 ft right
[1:33:02] over
[1:33:04] there and it's getting closer every
[1:33:06] minute I
[1:33:08] believe see that's why that when you put
[1:33:10] the spear in there see then what would
[1:33:13] be called what what could you
[1:33:15] say the word rest wouldn't be cor you
[1:33:18] couldn't say the rest of the Bride come
[1:33:20] out no the part of us that was not that
[1:33:24] Eternal section of going up with him and
[1:33:27] leaving and and going to hell with him
[1:33:29] and Etc uh it would be connected to this
[1:33:33] body because that that would connect him
[1:33:36] to this body he's connected to my body
[1:33:38] and your body that's how you can redeem
[1:33:40] them
[1:33:43] okay that what you anything else it's
[1:33:47] going to be exciting to see the Saints
[1:33:49] when they come back right
[1:33:52] I agree with it anybody
[1:33:59] else see that's that's why I don't like
[1:34:02] to say a lot of things cuz people think
[1:34:04] I'm picking on
[1:34:05] them but see that's why I
[1:34:08] believe Those Old Testament
[1:34:11] Saints there's a lot of lot of dealing
[1:34:14] right
[1:34:16] there you got a lot of quotes from
[1:34:18] brother
[1:34:20] Brandon
[1:34:23] some saying that they raised
[1:34:27] physically and some saying they're
[1:34:36] not I know one thing for
[1:34:39] certain they never made it to be the
[1:34:41] Bride of Jesus
[1:34:42] Christ I know
[1:34:45] that what else it is I I just know they
[1:34:49] never made it to be the bride and I just
[1:34:52] can't put him ah head of the
[1:34:53] Bride I got to put him in a position and
[1:34:56] can't put him ah
[1:34:57] head and I keep saying they without us
[1:35:00] cannot be made
[1:35:04] perfect it's just one of those things
