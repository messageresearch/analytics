[29:47] that coming from you know see a lot of
[29:50] people said oh we had a light in the
[29:51] house when I we did we had a light in
[29:52] the house and uh it was coming from a
[29:55] rig that brother Joe had placed in there
[29:57] well I didn't know we put it in there

[29:59] trying to bug the house if they want to
[30:01] know anything just call me and I'll tell
[30:03] them but come find out it was a
[30:06] Contraption where they could make the

[34:18] everything in it that we want to cover
[34:20] in the series that we're trying to to do
[34:24] all right I will praise thee for thou
[34:26] has heard me and art become my salvation
[34:29] the stone which the builders refused is
[34:31] become The Headstone of the corner this
[34:34] is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in
[34:36] our eyes this is the day which the Lord
[34:38] hath made we will rejoice and be glad in
[34:41] it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh
[34:44] Lord I beseech thee send now
[34:47] Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in
[34:51] the name of the Lord we have blessed you
[34:54] out of the house of the Lord all right
[34:58] let's go over
[35:00] to 1
[35:02] John 2 we just use verse
[35:07] 28 and now little children abide in him
[35:10] that when he shall appear we may have
[35:13] confidence and not be ashamed before him
[35:16] at his coming you may be seated the Lord
[35:20] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[35:22] word now we've been
[35:24] talking for quite a while this is
[35:28] message number nine on the coming of the
[35:33] Lord
[35:34] now as one believer in the Bible I
[35:38] believe in the second coming of Jesus
[35:41] Christ
[35:42] right now I don't believe it like we
[35:46] used to believe it but uh you
[35:49] know you know we used to be Tau that
[35:52] there'd be something out in the Eastern
[35:54] Skies would split and we'd hear a great
[35:56] big too too you know and the Lord would
[35:58] come down and the dead would be raised
[36:00] and you'd know he's doing that because
[36:02] all the graves be open and airplanes be
[36:05] crashing out of the Skies called the
[36:06] pilot went to Rapture you know different
[36:08] things you know we we used to to believe
[36:10] all of those things but through the
[36:13] opening of the word we come to find out
[36:16] that those things are not
[36:18] necessarily uh
[36:21] true uh we were doing the best we could
[36:23] do right but now through the the end
[36:25] time with the prophet's message and all
[36:28] uh we should be able to talk about the
[36:30] coming of the Lord in a greater manner
[36:33] or way than ever before because of him
[36:38] speaking to us the things of God right
[36:43] now I preached our last Wednesday on a
[36:47] message and I titled it um let's see
[36:50] something I forgot how I even titled it
[36:52] but anyhow it's the coming of the Lord
[36:55] but I want to make sure you get that
[36:57] tonight I want to make sure because I
[37:00] don't want us to make miss this point I
[37:02] believe if we miss this point we will
[37:05] miss uh the rest of it as we try to go
[37:08] along but now I've been speaking as I
[37:11] said about the second coming of Jesus
[37:14] Christ right now in the second coming of
[37:18] Jesus Christ I've given it to you over
[37:20] and over uh where the Prophet said the
[37:24] second coming of Jesus Christ would be
[37:25] the bride coming of Christ right right
[37:28] coming out of the
[37:29] church all right now so that's the
[37:32] second coming of Jesus Christ and we
[37:35] know for assurity that the prophet
[37:37] taught us that he will not set foot on
[37:40] Earth in this coming you know
[37:45] physically be here on Earth as a being
[37:48] so that does away from what we used to
[37:50] think about the sky of splitting and all
[37:52] of the things that would happen you know
[37:54] and all so then and we know that the
[37:57] second coming of Jesus Christ as I said
[38:00] last Wednesday has got to be covered in
[38:03] three stages or phases or whatever you
[38:05] want to call it I don't have the
[38:07] education but um not much sense but I do
[38:10] know that if you cross up the scriptures
[38:13] or the prophet's message then if you
[38:15] mislocate it you know misinterpret it
[38:18] Etc miss you you're going to miss the
[38:20] whole thing so in the second coming of
[38:23] Jesus Christ you got to cover the bride
[38:25] coming to Christ right coming out of the
[38:27] Church you got to cover the two
[38:29] witnesses going to Israel right and
[38:33] 144,000 receiving Christ right and still
[38:36] that will not be a physical uh mortal
[38:40] being standing there it'll be through
[38:42] the two witnesses all right then it goes
[38:45] on over and the prophet said that Jesus
[38:48] does not come back to earth until the
[38:51] Millennium so then in the Millennium
[38:54] would be finishing up the second coming
[38:57] which would would cover and not only
[38:59] will we be there but the 144,000 will
[39:02] also be there so it's all related to the
[39:05] to the same thing but that's what we've
[39:07] been trying to get you to see but if you
[39:09] cross up your scriptures see and and you
[39:12] say well well look at there it says the
[39:15] Lord's coming and and even to the Jews
[39:18] you know the 144,000 it says they'll say
[39:22] where did you get the nail prints in
[39:23] your hand well what do you mean the god
[39:26] out nail prints show them to them you
[39:28] know see and that's what we think we
[39:30] have it all figured out in our
[39:32] understanding but then we find out that
[39:35] the Corporal body of Jesus Christ does
[39:37] not come back that way all right see
[39:40] then in the second coming we're looking
[39:42] for some kind of a second
[39:44] coming you know something to come down
[39:48] right like that all right and I gave it
[39:52] to you I don't think you have them
[39:54] tonight in your notes but we'll be glad
[39:56] to show them to you
[39:58] page what is it 208 is that the one I
[40:01] gave him last week or 308 of the seal
[40:03] book where brother R said the second
[40:06] coming of Jesus
[40:07] Christ The Rapture right because we meet
[40:12] him in the
[40:14] air he doesn't come here physically
[40:17] right we meet him in the air all right
[40:20] now that's tying together all the
[40:22] scriptures see then in that way then
[40:25] looking at the second coming it's not
[40:27] looking looking for something to up
[40:28] there that's coming down here that way
[40:31] right see it's looking at it as a
[40:35] scriptural lineup of the truth to see
[40:38] that uh you know then we we look at it
[40:41] to see what what is his second
[40:44] coming and as I said the prophet said
[40:46] it's the bride coming to Christ right
[40:48] amen coming out of the church what is
[40:50] the rapture going to do to you and I
[40:53] what is this message supposed to do to
[40:54] you and I get us out of the church amen
[40:58] that's right all right get us out of our
[41:01] ideas well I never was brother Dale I
[41:04] never went to a church well you're just
[41:05] as bad as anybody else cuz we were all
[41:08] born that way right that's the human
[41:12] mind that's what the prophet is talking
[41:14] about not because you as brother Mo you
[41:16] say you can get your coat and hat and
[41:17] leave a church and go to another church
[41:19] what good have you done right but if
[41:21] it's not a coming out then where are we
[41:24] all right so now we read then and try to
[41:26] use that for a background I'm sorry that
[41:29] to try to these that are here but to try
[41:31] to move on because I don't like to keep
[41:34] backing up so
[41:36] much uh the tapes are there you're
[41:38] welcome to get them and the quotes are
[41:41] there now as I said we were talking
[41:43] about in the message there of to where
[41:48] the Prophet called
[41:49] it let me see entitled the message even
[41:52] to
[41:53] that appearing before his coming
[41:58] right and he says that there's two
[42:00] different words there now the word
[42:03] appear is used in John but in uh 1 Peter
[42:08] 1:7 it talks about the
[42:11] appearing you know of the Lord and the
[42:14] prophet said there's a difference in the
[42:17] appearing he said in the scriptures you
[42:19] got two different words all right that's
[42:22] what we want to talk about tonight two
[42:24] different
[42:26] words appearing and coming all watch are
[42:31] two different works
[42:34] right one is appearing the other one is
[42:37] coming right two different works you say
[42:40] well now works is something we do we see
[42:42] there's your definition on it so let's
[42:46] go over just while we're getting that
[42:47] point and let's read it look at Romans
[42:50] uh
[42:52] 9 and let's get a little something
[42:55] that this script opened up to me years
[42:58] ago and and I really thank God for
[43:02] it let look at Romans
[43:05] 9 verse 27 excuse me verse
[43:12] 28 for he will finish the
[43:16] work once and cut it short in
[43:21] righteousness because a short
[43:24] work will the Lord make upon the Earth
[43:29] now our definition of that would mean
[43:32] that God meant for it to go this
[43:36] far but he decided to cut it
[43:40] off is that what it kind of looks like
[43:42] you know that maybe God intended for it
[43:45] to go on down this way but he decided no
[43:47] I'll just cut it off
[43:50] here now you'll understand then why I'm
[43:52] using the word as two different words
[43:56] are two different works because the
[43:58] original
[44:00] translation of Romans
[44:03] 9:28 which uses the word
[44:07] work but that word work is 3056 in your
[44:11] Strong's Concordance which means word
[44:14] right the Lord is going to do a short
[44:18] word he's not going to do a short word
[44:21] he's not going to cut it short in
[44:22] righteousness he's not going to as I
[44:24] said have his thoughts of enduring this
[44:27] but instead of that well I'll just cut
[44:28] it off no he's going to do a short word
[44:32] right that's what your original says huh
[44:38] word works the word works there is 3056
[44:42] words or word
[44:45] saying
[44:48] speech I like this a word uttered by a
[44:53] living voice right now that's how the
[44:56] strongs
[44:58] concordance so it's not a short work
[45:01] that he was going to do and going to
[45:02] quit it and all it's a short
[45:04] word right what's he going to do he's
[45:06] going to pour it in in hurry in the last
[45:09] days
[45:11] right it's not that he's going was
[45:13] intending to reveal whole lot of word
[45:15] and he's going to cut it out no he's
[45:16] going to reveal it in a hurry amen I
[45:19] mean it used to be that some of you were
[45:22] there and things and especially people
[45:24] here in the message tonight that you
[45:26] know back even in my day that we would
[45:29] uh we'd get a tape or two and get a book
[45:32] or two and and it' be a while before we
[45:34] get anything else you know and we just
[45:37] wasn't able to say well brother BR said
[45:40] this said this said this well see I had
[45:42] it in my Bible because there in in John
[45:46] where we was reading about the
[45:47] difference in the appearing and the
[45:49] coming I had a couple of messages
[45:51] written there and showing that brother
[45:54] brandham said that there was a
[45:57] difference in the two words right all
[45:59] right now we went through and there
[46:01] laying in the office if you want it we
[46:03] went through this past Wednesday with
[46:07] the the part of showing the difference
[46:11] between the word
[46:14] appearing right and the word coming
[46:17] literally in the scriptures right the
[46:21] word
[46:22] appearing is like I said in 1 Peter 1:7
[46:27] it means to uncover or lay open what has
[46:30] been veiled or covered up
[46:35] disclose make bar to make known make
[46:38] manifest disclose what before was
[46:41] unknown that's what the appearing is
[46:43] right all right but then the word coming
[46:47] is the Greek word used
[46:49] 3950 uh two which is the word they argue
[46:53] in the message a lot about that's called
[46:56] paraca or
[46:58] perusia see that was the they say it's
[47:01] pronounced paria that's all right I
[47:03] don't know the difference I just know
[47:04] the definition CU I can read right see
[47:08] the King James version says in 1 John
[47:12] 228 at his coming the original
[47:15] translation says in the presence of him
[47:20] that is what the word coming means cuz
[47:22] it means coming it means presence it
[47:25] means the coming arrival Advent
[47:27] especially the future visible return
[47:30] from Heaven of Jesus to raise the dead
[47:33] hold the last judgment and set up formal
[47:34] and glorious the kingdom all right so I
[47:37] gave you the definitions to were that
[47:40] you would have it to be able
[47:43] to
[47:45] understand the prophet said it's two
[47:48] different words right one of them is
[47:51] something being seen the other one is in
[47:54] physical actual happen
[47:57] happening now that's where that then in
[48:02] the actual happening I'll get to it
[48:04] later on the message where the Prophet
[48:07] said that Jesus would be visible Among
[48:10] Us and raise the dead and we go in
[48:12] Rapture I've given you that quote over
[48:14] and over what the Holy Ghost was given
[48:16] for all right but that's not physical
[48:20] that's not mortal
[48:22] amen that's visible
[48:25] right visible means apparent to the eye
[48:29] Webster in other words it's not the
[48:32] physical eye
[48:34] necessarily it's the spiritual eye that
[48:37] sees you don't see with your natural eye
[48:40] you see with your your your inward being
[48:43] your ey is only a transmitter of
[48:45] backwards and forward all but see then
[48:48] to be visible Among Us doesn't mean he's
[48:50] going to be standing here in the
[48:51] physical body right amen no it means
[48:55] he's going to be here so visible until
[48:58] it's close to the fact but it will be
[49:01] outside of a glor a body like that cuz
[49:05] we're his body amen right why would he
[49:07] want to come back now we're his body
[49:09] amen right all right that's why we meet
[49:12] him in the air amen we only meet we only
[49:16] meet him in the air in the when it comes
[49:19] to the basis that he can be visible
[49:21] Among Us right right amen now in that
[49:26] then
[49:27] is the statement and reason why I preach
[49:30] the way I
[49:31] do cuz I believed this for 40 years I
[49:34] guess I believe the second coming of
[49:37] Jesus Christ to the
[49:40] bride you understand the bride amen is
[49:43] what the prophet said coming out of the
[49:46] church so I believe that on the day of
[49:50] Pentecost started the second coming of
[49:52] Jesus Christ
[49:55] amen we'll get to that point in a minute
[49:57] I believe that on the day of
[50:00] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost descended
[50:03] that that started the second coming amen
[50:07] all right now then that would be
[50:08] finished in this day
[50:12] amen I don't want to go too far on the
[50:14] word of it because I want to keep your
[50:16] thought in a line but if you'll just get
[50:18] the definition of the
[50:20] words and look at those words I ask you
[50:23] to read those quotes that I gave you
[50:25] last Wednesday old over and over and
[50:28] over how many I ain't going to ask for
[50:30] to raise
[50:34] hand but that's the way brother Rams one
[50:37] it said it
[50:39] right all right see then he said there's
[50:41] a difference in the appearing and the
[50:44] coming right right a difference in the
[50:48] appearing and the coming he said in the
[50:52] scripture so I gave you the definition
[50:55] of the words appearing in
[50:58] coming now see I
[51:01] believe that's what I I just tell you
[51:03] what I believe I don't hide nothing with
[51:05] nobody I believe that the Lord can
[51:09] appear in many places that's right
[51:12] amen okay I believe he can appear out
[51:14] there in the denominations tonight right
[51:17] I believe he can appear in the Catholic
[51:19] church that's right I believe he can
[51:20] appear in the in the the mosque of
[51:24] Omar right I believe he can appear in
[51:27] many
[51:30] places all right because that is a
[51:33] spiritual
[51:36] sense he can be there if there's anybody
[51:39] ever healed anywhere when the Beatles
[51:40] were singing the songs right and and the
[51:43] the people were healed who healed them
[51:45] the be a come
[51:47] on right no it had to be the presence of
[51:51] the Lord Jesus Christ CU only God is the
[51:53] Healer right all right so presence are
[51:56] appear the appearing he can be
[52:01] anywhere he can appear in a barroom like
[52:03] Brother Richard Wilson tells you about
[52:05] his testimony that he was sitting in a
[52:07] bar and and drinking Y and he turned to
[52:11] start out and when he did said a voice
[52:13] said you won't be back in here
[52:16] again well brother R said on the tape
[52:19] one day he said he may have to come in
[52:20] the barroom and get
[52:24] you you see now now that was his
[52:27] appearing right amen okay cuz he can
[52:32] appear but now the coming of the Lord
[52:36] see the appearing is apparent to the eye
[52:38] or like Paul I gave you the
[52:41] definitions like the word
[52:43] Vision the word vision is the same word
[52:46] as appear appearing
[52:48] Etc all right but the word coming is his
[52:52] presence right right now his presence
[52:56] now you got to hold on cuz listen his
[52:59] presence is not in the
[53:01] barroom right he didn't give you the new
[53:04] birth sitting on the bar stool he called
[53:07] you out of the
[53:10] barroom I read one time about these
[53:12] women that were in a thing you know and
[53:15] they do a strip tease and then when it
[53:17] was over with they'd sat down and talk
[53:19] to the people about the
[53:21] Lord and try to get people converted
[53:27] what to right the bar room and the
[53:30] stripped off naked woman come on but
[53:33] that's the way people think right right
[53:36] see the women thought that was their
[53:38] Ministry to get people saved like
[53:42] Brother Gary Atkins used to say about
[53:44] the if that what is hippie Street down
[53:47] in town was what it supposed to be you
[53:49] know the love movement you the hippies
[53:52] then they already had
[53:55] it but no but now listen his appearing
[53:59] can be in many places but his coming is
[54:02] only through his presence being revealed
[54:05] to you amen that's why I believe the new
[54:08] birth is the revealing of God's word
[54:12] amen you tell me what else it is right
[54:15] shouting screaming Glory Hallelujah no
[54:18] that's after effects right that is not
[54:21] the new birth that's what you do after
[54:23] you get the new birth the birth is the
[54:25] birth of the word
[54:28] amen see the birth of the word brings
[54:30] the presence of God to
[54:34] you then the presence of God is a
[54:37] greater form our works of
[54:40] God than in his
[54:42] appearing when we go out of here in the
[54:45] Rapture you know
[54:47] what a lot of people will still be
[54:49] shouting Glory hallelujah
[54:53] amen right but the Lord's done gone
[54:58] Prophet said he's still thinking to
[54:59] getting the Holy Ghost right now let me
[55:02] ask you a question for where I won't
[55:04] miss it cuz I got in here
[55:06] somewhere what was the first coming of
[55:09] the
[55:10] Lord now he appeared many times
[55:13] throughout the Old
[55:16] Testament many
[55:18] forms many ways Pillar of
[55:22] Fire Cloud even as mount chesc amen
[55:27] Angel of the Lord to be in the fiery
[55:30] furnace with the Hebrew
[55:31] children he appeared in many
[55:34] ways but one day he came in human flesh
[55:39] amen that was his first coming am right
[55:43] right yes so what would you want to
[55:45] change the second coming Brother Gary to
[55:48] be
[55:50] right why do you want to try to make it
[55:52] some form that it's not what exactly
[55:54] what the first coming would be
[55:57] the first coming was God revealed in
[56:00] human flesh amen the second coming is
[56:03] what God revealed in your flesh by the
[56:07] new
[56:08] birth so he begin his second coming on
[56:11] the day of Pentecost amen we're in the
[56:13] ending of all
[56:15] things you
[56:17] know we're in the ending of all forms I
[56:21] don't don't think I've run out of
[56:22] something and run off because we're
[56:24] going to get into one of these days
[56:26] talking about the coming of the Lord as
[56:28] The
[56:30] Headstone you'll see why I kept reading
[56:32] Psalms all right so don't worry about
[56:34] that going on down the road I'm going to
[56:36] cover one of these days and got notes
[56:38] for it to cover that he will become
[56:41] visible Among Us where your Prophet said
[56:43] it and raised the dead and we go in
[56:45] Rapture amen so don't worry about it
[56:47] just just listen see see I believe that
[56:51] the Lord has been coming since the day
[56:52] of Pentecost in the heart of the bride
[56:55] of Christ right because that was what
[56:58] would be taking the bride out of the
[57:04] church now is your thoughts that when
[57:07] the prophet said the second coming of
[57:08] Jesus Christ is is the bright coming of
[57:10] Christ coming out of church that that's
[57:11] just in this
[57:14] time no right am he's been coming all
[57:17] the way down to that cuz it's not a
[57:20] physical
[57:21] coming but it's a presence of himself
[57:25] right
[57:27] In You by the new birth right now do you
[57:31] see the difference in the
[57:33] appearing but he can appear to you to
[57:35] lead you out of a bar run but when he
[57:37] gives you the new birth that's not his
[57:39] appearing that's right amen that's his
[57:41] coming to you amen well I I heard that
[57:44] not in the denomination they talking
[57:46] about to come and is coming to you well
[57:48] that's all right you're going to hear it
[57:50] a whole lot more if you hang around here
[57:52] amen because that's what I believe right
[57:56] go what are you looking for right oh no
[57:59] we're not looking for the Eastern Skies
[58:00] to split we're not looking for the
[58:01] trumpet to sound we're not well what do
[58:04] you
[58:06] believe well I just believe in his
[58:09] coming well praise the Lord I do
[58:13] too I'm just not looking for it up there
[58:16] right about 30 something years ago the
[58:20] Lord showed me something and you know I
[58:22] quit then trying to go to heaven that's
[58:24] right am because I realized if I ever
[58:28] got
[58:29] there that he's going to have to come
[58:31] here and get me and take me there
[58:34] right but he's not coming here physical
[58:37] right Corporal body and get me I'm going
[58:40] to meet that in the a right they going
[58:42] to come here in a presence that's right
[58:45] so don't worry about it that in you word
[58:47] is it really you know the brothers
[58:49] preached it and I'm not against that's
[58:51] their business they preached the peruas
[58:54] 1963 and that's when the Lord came and
[58:57] there's a lot of Truth to what they're
[58:58] talking about but I believe that the
[59:01] Lord came by the new birth amen because
[59:05] 1963 doesn't have anything to do with me
[59:07] and you unless we're born again right
[59:09] that's
[59:10] right that's right I mean if you're not
[59:12] born again they don't have anything do
[59:14] we you amen it's a condemnation right
[59:17] all right now God is living in
[59:20] You by the new birth are the word being
[59:24] revealed to you
[59:26] which is not just a a uh an
[59:30] anointing
[59:32] right because you can have the baptism
[59:34] of the Holy Ghost every day of your life
[59:36] on your spirit right and die and go to
[59:39] hell right well wouldn't that be
[59:40] appearing come on I gave you a lot of
[59:43] the quotes where the brother ROM was
[59:44] covering he said appearing now in the
[59:47] church right course you know everybody
[59:49] said oh yeah he appeared and around him
[59:51] we believe that but I gave you the
[59:54] quotes where he was talking about about
[59:56] the appearing in the church amen in the
[59:59] bride all right
[1:00:03] now I gave you these this is one that
[1:00:06] was given to you last
[1:00:09] Wednesday where brother Brown says on we
[1:00:12] would see Jesus
[1:00:14] 1962 627 you don't have this one now
[1:00:18] you'll have one to follow in this
[1:00:20] one you see the West Coast the s o n is
[1:00:23] appearing before his coming
[1:00:28] he's appearing before he's coming
[1:00:31] remember appearing and coming is two
[1:00:32] different words see he's appearing now
[1:00:35] into church showing himself alive after
[1:00:38] 2,000 years sir we would see
[1:00:43] Jesus two different words right
[1:00:46] appearing and coming now pick up where
[1:00:49] you got them I just added that one cuz
[1:00:51] I've got the others laying
[1:00:53] here and if you want them after the
[1:00:56] service we'll be glad to give them to
[1:00:57] you of all of the quotes that we used
[1:01:00] last
[1:01:01] week but in the message
[1:01:05] perseverance preach in 1962 608 did you
[1:01:09] know that the Bible speaks of the
[1:01:10] appearing of the Lord and also the
[1:01:12] coming of the lord it's two different
[1:01:16] works now look at you no it's two
[1:01:19] different
[1:01:20] works why I titled it two different
[1:01:22] words two different
[1:01:24] works is two different works right
[1:01:27] search it and find out if that's right
[1:01:31] the appearing and the coming is two
[1:01:33] different things the appearing of the
[1:01:35] Lord is now he's appearing amongst his
[1:01:38] people we see him in his same works the
[1:01:41] appearing his holy spirit but his coming
[1:01:44] will be in a physical being it will be
[1:01:48] to catch the church up you go right on
[1:01:51] down reading the rest of goes on down in
[1:01:53] that's paragraph uh I e95 e96 so the
[1:01:58] Lord is now appearing among his people
[1:02:00] great signs and wonders raising the dead
[1:02:02] Healing The Sick and doing the very same
[1:02:05] things he did that hasn't been done for
[1:02:07] 2,000 years now like I said Wednesday
[1:02:10] brother brandham prayed for a man for
[1:02:12] his nose to be restored a few days later
[1:02:15] it was restored brother Bosworth if I
[1:02:17] Ain mistaken prayed and it was instantly
[1:02:20] healed or restored see we think brother
[1:02:23] randam was the only one that had it why
[1:02:24] don't you think he called it Divine
[1:02:26] Healing campaign right or Roberts and
[1:02:28] all of those men went forth that God was
[1:02:31] using them amen it was a healing
[1:02:35] campaign T osbor all those men
[1:02:40] used to do great wonders and signs am
[1:02:44] well we don't know about that we just
[1:02:45] know about brother brand well you're not
[1:02:47] even in his coming anyway so you don't
[1:02:48] have the new birth right you had a new
[1:02:51] birth you'd have enough sense to realize
[1:02:53] what it said the true
[1:02:56] right that he was back there he's still
[1:02:58] here now right if you can't see him
[1:03:02] now in the new birth and his presence
[1:03:05] with you healing and delivering right
[1:03:07] amen then you're blind right amen it's a
[1:03:11] best way to say it at least you can't
[1:03:13] say I don't play
[1:03:15] around you I tell you like it is because
[1:03:19] brother R said when you say it hard and
[1:03:21] strong people won't know won't think
[1:03:23] you're trying to pull something over on
[1:03:25] you say it real soft you know they don't
[1:03:27] know what you're
[1:03:28] doing but now
[1:03:32] listen brother brandom says on Christ
[1:03:34] The Mystery of God
[1:03:38] revealed that he had to
[1:03:40] wait God had to wait page 32 number two
[1:03:45] on your
[1:03:46] nose he had to
[1:03:48] wait until the secret could be given in
[1:03:52] full right look at what under line
[1:03:57] waiting to make it
[1:04:00] known in the last days as he promised
[1:04:03] waiting for it to be fully
[1:04:07] comprehended before he could express
[1:04:13] it waiting for it to be fully
[1:04:16] comprehended what's he talking about the
[1:04:19] next paragraph tells you now the coming
[1:04:21] of the Lord is in
[1:04:24] mystery we don't know when he's coming
[1:04:26] how he's
[1:04:28] coming but we know he's
[1:04:30] coming right well brother Dale the
[1:04:33] prophet said he didn't even know how
[1:04:34] he's coming and you told us his coming
[1:04:37] was the New
[1:04:40] Birth well if you're not sensible enough
[1:04:43] to know what the prophet is doing you
[1:04:45] need a new birth come on because surely
[1:04:48] at this time he knew what the second
[1:04:50] coming of Jesus Christ was right amen
[1:04:53] this is 63 you know by then he knew cuz
[1:04:55] he preached a three-fold revelation of
[1:04:57] it that's right right Amen on the
[1:05:01] seventh seal he only preached one fold
[1:05:03] of it spoke a little bit of the second
[1:05:05] stopped and left it for quite a while
[1:05:08] then on Christ of mystery he preached
[1:05:09] the three-fold Revelation amen of what
[1:05:12] the coming of Jesus Christ right
[1:05:17] right and that way he said it had to be
[1:05:19] weit until it could be comprehended what
[1:05:22] what was he waiting for it to be able to
[1:05:24] comprehend
[1:05:26] is
[1:05:30] coming you say but now now Jesus didn't
[1:05:33] even know no but I can quote too because
[1:05:35] I remember everybody calls me
[1:05:37] intellectual and that's all
[1:05:39] right if that's because I can quote
[1:05:41] brother ROM you got a problem brother
[1:05:44] rown said when Jesus come to John on
[1:05:46] patmas he knew when he would be coming
[1:05:49] and he said he put it
[1:05:52] there when he come to John on pmas he
[1:05:54] knew
[1:05:56] when he would be coming cuz he had went
[1:05:58] back to where he was originally and come
[1:06:01] back that's right all right now see if
[1:06:05] we must meet him in the
[1:06:07] air and he does not come to
[1:06:11] Earth in a physical body then we better
[1:06:15] be thinking about the coming of the Lord
[1:06:18] has been revealed
[1:06:23] right what do you think of his message
[1:06:26] was Far amen I haven't even got to the
[1:06:28] scripture where it said the Lord himself
[1:06:29] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:06:31] voice of an archangel trumpet I even got
[1:06:33] to there yet we just building the
[1:06:35] background to talk about some things
[1:06:38] right see it is only
[1:06:42] revealed the second coming of Jesus
[1:06:44] Christ can only be revealed to those who
[1:06:48] have the new birth
[1:06:50] amen that don't mean a light bub turned
[1:06:53] on does it
[1:06:54] right that ought to be
[1:06:57] sensible the Bible said that no man can
[1:07:00] call Jesus the Christ what except what
[1:07:03] am your Prophet said except by the new
[1:07:05] birth right cuz you're only saying what
[1:07:07] somebody else says and that's her
[1:07:09] problem Mama told us come on brother
[1:07:12] mama said the heavens are open one of
[1:07:14] these days like I told you somebody told
[1:07:17] me when I was a little kid that I know
[1:07:20] when the Lord was coming because it'd be
[1:07:22] a cloud and there'd be an umbrella in
[1:07:25] the cloud
[1:07:26] oh man I'd go out every time he come up
[1:07:28] a
[1:07:29] cloud I'm looking for an
[1:07:35] umbrella what was your
[1:07:38] stupidity I admit
[1:07:40] mine what is yours now come on I will
[1:07:44] admit what I am but
[1:07:47] listen the prophet said there's a
[1:07:49] difference in the appearing and the
[1:07:52] coming right now I used to think as I
[1:07:55] told there was only just a few of those
[1:07:57] until I I got to run it through the
[1:07:59] computer again and I got to find in a
[1:08:02] whole lot and I gave them to you last
[1:08:05] week and uh you know a lot of the
[1:08:08] things and if you would have time and
[1:08:10] you want to read them I'll be glad for
[1:08:12] you to take these where that he says
[1:08:14] that the appearing of the Lord comes
[1:08:16] before the coming of the Lord that's the
[1:08:18] message letting off the pressure
[1:08:21] 62 it is I Be not Afraid you know
[1:08:23] there's a difference between the
[1:08:24] appearing of Christ and the coming of
[1:08:26] Christ that's two different words all
[1:08:28] together the appearing now to church we
[1:08:30] see him
[1:08:32] right Be not Afraid 62 there's a
[1:08:36] different word used the appearing and of
[1:08:38] Christ and the coming of Christ there
[1:08:40] two different words all together Christ
[1:08:42] is appearing in these last days in his
[1:08:43] church bringing his church together in
[1:08:46] unity we would see Jesus
[1:08:49] 62 after 2,000 years we see the
[1:08:51] infallible proof that we can see Jesus
[1:08:55] us he's appearing in our midst just
[1:08:58] before his coming he's making his
[1:09:00] appearance in his church in the last
[1:09:03] days you'll be welcome to
[1:09:06] these I don't mean that sarcastically
[1:09:08] I'm just say it if you don't know
[1:09:09] brother R said it run in the message
[1:09:13] appearing and then coming now there is
[1:09:15] some catches to it that sometimes it
[1:09:17] will not appear it's appearing and
[1:09:19] coming so if you want these welcome to
[1:09:21] cut you down on your short on trying to
[1:09:24] do it but go back last Wednesday and you
[1:09:26] hear the prophet saying the things that
[1:09:29] I'm talking
[1:09:30] about cuz you see I believe he's been
[1:09:34] appearing
[1:09:36] right but the mystery of it was at the
[1:09:39] same time he was
[1:09:41] appearing his coming was transpiring
[1:09:44] right
[1:09:46] amen cuz he was coming in the bride
[1:09:48] right who led Luther out of the Catholic
[1:09:51] Church
[1:09:59] that was this coming we see to be
[1:10:01] climaxed in you and I because the
[1:10:04] prophet of God said the coming of the
[1:10:06] Lord is Mystery is in a
[1:10:09] mystery his coming is in a mystery
[1:10:12] amen we know in the Scripture it talks
[1:10:14] about the mystery of the
[1:10:16] Gentiles everybody thinks of what
[1:10:18] brother Ram is talking about when he'll
[1:10:20] use that scripture he's not talking
[1:10:21] about the coming of the Gentiles Bing
[1:10:24] knew about that and told us about
[1:10:26] he's talking about an end time
[1:10:29] coming the word of the Lord can descend
[1:10:31] from heaven with a shout the voice of
[1:10:33] the Archangel will have to be in the
[1:10:35] bride cuz she's the final voice under
[1:10:38] her message let me quote it under her
[1:10:41] messenger she'll be the final voice to
[1:10:43] the final age
[1:10:44] amen so the voice of the Resurrection
[1:10:47] will have to be in the bride amen God's
[1:10:49] waiting on you and IA right but in time
[1:10:52] where he can pour in his fullness right
[1:10:55] amen
[1:10:55] come
[1:10:58] on you see I want to make sure you
[1:11:02] understand see the seventh seal souls in
[1:11:05] prison you look at number five on your
[1:11:08] notes watch that seven that's the
[1:11:11] Finish seventh is always a mystery that
[1:11:14] was the coming of the
[1:11:17] Lord and
[1:11:19] noticed he said that was the coming of
[1:11:23] the Lord right amen
[1:11:26] right like I said to you I haven't got
[1:11:29] to this yet so hang on to it all the
[1:11:32] quotes that you find of the appearing
[1:11:34] and the coming was from 62
[1:11:39] back I've never found one after 62 where
[1:11:42] he was talking about the peering and the
[1:11:44] coming of two different words if you do
[1:11:46] let me know it's all right it won't
[1:11:48] change what I'm
[1:11:49] saying right could you
[1:11:52] see he was looking at the peering of
[1:11:54] Jesus Jesus
[1:11:56] Christ but when he met God out there and
[1:11:59] come back to preach those seals he never
[1:12:01] spoke anymore about his appearing
[1:12:04] right he never spoke of anything that's
[1:12:07] why he called let's see where it
[1:12:13] say don't Christ the mystery the seven
[1:12:16] Thunders uttered their voices and John
[1:12:18] was even forbid to write the coming of
[1:12:20] the
[1:12:21] Lord what is the coming of the Lord
[1:12:23] Brother Brandon
[1:12:26] Feast of the trumpets number six on your
[1:12:28] notes 64 719 the seventh seal has an
[1:12:33] open yet you know that's his
[1:12:37] coming see the seventh is a
[1:12:39] mystery that's is
[1:12:42] coming and you can't explain that to
[1:12:45] anyone else right because it can only be
[1:12:47] revealed to you personally
[1:12:50] amen I can't reveal it to you brother
[1:12:52] randam couldn't reveal it to you right
[1:12:54] that's right
[1:12:55] now brother randam said Jesus
[1:12:58] said my own life didn't reveal that
[1:13:01] that's right that's
[1:13:03] right so now no man can reveal to
[1:13:06] another man anything right right you can
[1:13:08] only use words to speak of something
[1:13:11] long enough for the Holy Spirit to be
[1:13:13] able to Quicken it in your heart now if
[1:13:15] you don't have the Holy Spirit that's
[1:13:17] why you see so many doctrines that's
[1:13:19] right and ideas see Amen in the
[1:13:22] denominations and in this message y
[1:13:25] because everybody has their own concept
[1:13:28] y That's right people actually literally
[1:13:30] preached years ago the perusia or paria
[1:13:33] people now I ain't saying everybody
[1:13:35] cuz but the ones I heard was preaching
[1:13:38] what that in
[1:13:40] 1963 the Lord
[1:13:42] came well then others went on to make
[1:13:45] brother r on that Lord and how that the
[1:13:47] Lord died on amarilla
[1:13:50] road and in Texas 65
[1:13:56] but you
[1:13:57] see I believe what the prophet is
[1:13:59] talking about
[1:14:01] amen but I believe there's a difference
[1:14:03] in the appearing amen and the coming
[1:14:05] right
[1:14:06] amen and then you'll see one day why
[1:14:09] that it was up until 62 he kept speaking
[1:14:12] and I ain't one of them come on I don't
[1:14:15] play games I'm not one of them that
[1:14:18] until 62 he taught one thing and after
[1:14:22] 62 he taught something else I do not
[1:14:25] believe that I believe he talked the
[1:14:27] same all the way through he so he
[1:14:29] changed the new birth show me where it
[1:14:31] did Future home he said that he taught
[1:14:34] three processes from the
[1:14:37] beginning and show me where he changed
[1:14:40] that's right oh of course that doesn't
[1:14:42] do any good but it just flows through
[1:14:44] people's mind right on out the other
[1:14:47] side and they pass it back behind them
[1:14:49] to the next one cuz they got it all
[1:14:51] figured out right you see
[1:14:55] brother Ram didn't have it figured
[1:14:57] out right God is the only one that knows
[1:15:01] am that's right but if he can reveal
[1:15:04] that mystery read Christ The Mystery of
[1:15:06] God
[1:15:07] revealed when he gets over about page 17
[1:15:11] and talking about the coming of the Lord
[1:15:14] the seventh seal
[1:15:16] Yen and showing you exactly what it is
[1:15:19] in a three-fold revelation amen all God
[1:15:23] was he pour into Christ all Christ in
[1:15:25] the
[1:15:26] church and what then to take her back to
[1:15:28] the Garden of Eden
[1:15:30] right restore Fallen Eve
[1:15:33] amen all right so now you say well
[1:15:35] brother D what are you talking
[1:15:38] about he's appearing among
[1:15:42] us but if we can just see what that new
[1:15:45] birth means right you say brother Dale
[1:15:47] you preached so deep I don't understand
[1:15:49] you show me how more simple you can make
[1:15:51] it please come up here and do it and I'm
[1:15:53] not saying it wrong right women whatever
[1:15:56] come on tell us how simple it
[1:15:59] is right when I preach that the coming
[1:16:02] of the Lord is a revealing of his word

[1:16:28] right because the coming of the Lord is
[1:16:30] what the revealing of his
[1:16:32] Worden and you tell me how more simple
[1:16:34] that can
[1:16:37] be you
[1:16:40] know the entire Bible is the revelation
[1:16:43] of Jesus Christ right that's what he
[1:16:45] says in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:16:47] revealed
[1:16:49] amen that's why he calls it Christ the
[1:16:51] mystery didn't say Jesus the mystery
[1:16:54] M cuz Jesus never fulfilled the full
[1:16:57] mystery it was all in him yeah cuz we
[1:16:59] were in him Amen in the New Birth not in
[1:17:03] physical
[1:17:05] people but it's Christ the
[1:17:08] mystery brother R said I couldn't
[1:17:10] understand how
[1:17:12] that Moses could tell God a better way
[1:17:14] of doing
[1:17:15] something he said until I seen it was
[1:17:18] Christ he didn't say I seen it was Jesus
[1:17:20] he said I seen it was Christ
[1:17:23] amen the Christ is the mystery of God
[1:17:25] revealed that's
[1:17:27] right now
[1:17:30] listen we
[1:17:32] must during the
[1:17:34] time that he's
[1:17:38] appearing in this last days with great
[1:17:41] signs and wonders now are you are you
[1:17:43] going to be dumb enough excuse me are
[1:17:45] you going to be far enough off to say
[1:17:48] that that that God is not outd there in
[1:17:49] the denominations Healing The
[1:17:53] Sick are you that far mentally
[1:17:56] off that he's not out there Healing The
[1:17:58] Sick and doing great
[1:18:02] wonders come on he's out there more than
[1:18:04] most of us
[1:18:05] because that's all they dealing with but
[1:18:08] see that's his anointing right right
[1:18:12] exactly
[1:18:13] right that's his anointing that's out
[1:18:16] there amen but that's not his coming
[1:18:19] right right amen he's only coming in his
[1:18:22] bride am amen
[1:18:27] not Rebecca knew what Isaac looked like
[1:18:32] right right
[1:18:33] amen

[1:18:38] into a lot of things but I mean you pick
[1:18:41] out a husband a wife for your husband
[1:18:43] and and then you w't at least tell them
[1:18:46] what it look like you know I mean even
[1:18:49] in these marriage things that brother
[1:18:50] prash and India and them they do at
[1:18:52] least they know most all way their life
[1:18:55] that that who they're going to marry
[1:18:56] maybe because they and they've seen them
[1:18:59] and and everything else it's not just a
[1:19:01] guy over here decides to get this and
[1:19:02] his over side well let's put them
[1:19:03] together and make a
[1:19:05] marriage

[1:19:10] other
[1:19:12] Rebecca had heard so much about Isaac
[1:19:16] right right
[1:19:18] until she said is that him standing in
[1:19:21] the field
[1:19:24] I your Prophet used that to show what
[1:19:26] that Jesus we would meet him in the air
[1:19:28] right right amen but we're going to have
[1:19:30] to know all about him right because if
[1:19:34] not we're going to be caught by these
[1:19:36] Antichrist oh my that will be telling us
[1:19:39] they are Jesus and they are this and
[1:19:41] they're that
[1:19:43] right but see Rebecca she knew but

[1:20:07] provided her a garment she got herself
[1:20:09] ready right she got her own dress she
[1:20:11] done her own thing amen but in God
[1:20:15] see God supplies
[1:20:17] everything but you know Rebecca she
[1:20:19] wasn't running out through there across
[1:20:21] the yard you know looking like Joy saw

[1:23:33] on that's right God ain't going to adopt
[1:23:35] a child just because he's 2 years old
[1:23:36] and because he belongs to his mom and
[1:23:38] daddy
[1:23:39] right and I like the way that I believe
[1:23:42] it too that God ain't going to adopt the
[1:23:44] devil's children that's right he's going
[1:23:46] to make you a child of his before he

[1:25:02] listen
[1:25:06] folks he must
[1:25:08] appear That's right now tie this
[1:25:12] together I'll
[1:25:13] quit in that appearing is where he
[1:25:16] becomes visible right that's
[1:25:20] right now that sounds a little odd
[1:25:26] don't do away with the appearing and
[1:25:28] start oh we're in the coming we're in
[1:25:30] the coming oh now we're in the coming

[1:25:33] the coming we toot you horn all you want
[1:25:35] to you going to be in the tribulation
[1:25:37] tooting
[1:25:40] it he's appearing now
[1:25:45] right he's going to become visible Among
[1:25:47] Us right he's going to raise the dead
[1:25:50] and we're going to go into Rapture right
[1:25:52] it's not you and me right
[1:25:55] is him amen it is he that hath made us
[1:25:57] and not we are his not
[1:26:00] we ourselves right he's made us for a
[1:26:05] purpose to know and realize the coming
[1:26:08] of the Lord is that new birth that's
[1:26:09] within your heart but that's not the
[1:26:11] finish of the coming of the Lord come on
[1:26:13] Amen right that's just the beginning of
[1:26:15] the coming that's
[1:26:20] right but that is the beginning of it
[1:26:23] right
[1:26:24] as Jesus was there on
[1:26:27] Earth he appeared in the Old Testament
[1:26:29] as the Christ
[1:26:32] right right but then one day he walked
[1:26:34] out there in human flesh right
[1:26:38] amen by the new birth is God in
[1:26:41] you I've heard people say that I wish I
[1:26:44] could come to the place where that that
[1:26:46] it would be like Jesus where he says
[1:26:48] he's pleased to dwell what you don't
[1:26:50] have the new birth then because if you
[1:26:51] got the new birth exactly where he said
[1:26:53] he he pleased to dwell in you right amen
[1:26:57] are you going to wait till you get up to
[1:26:58] the top of the pyramid then he gets
[1:26:59] pleased no amen he either dwells in you
[1:27:03] by the new birth or he's not d right we
[1:27:06] don't grab ourselves like brother Mo
[1:27:07] said by shoe heels our straps you know
[1:27:11] strings and jump up in The Headstone
[1:27:13] right now you're going to have to be
[1:27:15] birthed into it you're going to be born
[1:27:17] into these things and being born into
[1:27:20] him can only be one thing what the
[1:27:22] revealing of his word right amen
[1:27:25] I'm not looking for his coming I'm
[1:27:26] saying he's here
[1:27:29] right now I'm going to make one more
[1:27:31] statement and I'll quit Brother Gary
[1:27:32] tell them what page it's
[1:27:34] on bless he knows what I'm saying I
[1:27:39] preached the seals back there in 79 then
[1:27:41] preached it again in ' 82 cuz it wasn't
[1:27:43] satisfied I didn't finish in 79 and I
[1:27:45] couldn't see the end of all things but
[1:27:47] in ' 82 I begin to preach the seals I've
[1:27:49] never preached on them again why cuz I
[1:27:52] don't need to right but you know in that
[1:27:54] I made a
[1:27:56] statement I said why is people so
[1:27:58] concerned about the coming of the
[1:28:01] Lord you realized that when he raised
[1:28:04] from the dead he appeared right now are
[1:28:08] you
[1:28:09] listening he
[1:28:12] appeared to
[1:28:14] those and they went out a
[1:28:17] message that he is risen
[1:28:21] right right right
[1:28:24] well why wouldn't the seventh seal being
[1:28:26] in the end of all things be one simple
[1:28:28] thing he is here
[1:28:32] right he is
[1:28:35] here well where's he
[1:28:38] at get born again you'll know exactly
[1:28:41] where he's
[1:28:45] at he's inside of you by the new
[1:28:50] birth that's his
[1:28:52] coming I that's not all of it I've never
[1:28:56] taught nothing like
[1:28:58] that I said we'll get to the point of
[1:29:01] the coming of The Headstone cuz we could
[1:29:03] preach the statue of a perfect man of
[1:29:05] the coming of virtue to
[1:29:09] Faith and then knowledge coming
[1:29:11] Temperance coming patience coming
[1:29:14] godliness coming all of those things is
[1:29:18] is
[1:29:19] coming just get one thing
[1:29:23] appearing it's like Visions it's like
[1:29:25] apparent to the eye which means that
[1:29:27] it's not necessarily to the physical eye
[1:29:30] it doesn't even mean that in Webster it
[1:29:32] can be the spiritual eye of
[1:29:36] understanding I've had a couple of
[1:29:37] Visions I used to say I had one now I've
[1:29:39] had
[1:29:41] two and those Visions I had nothing to
[1:29:44] do with
[1:29:45] it I was standing here reading the
[1:29:47] scripture one night and looking down
[1:29:50] reading the scripture
[1:29:52] literally and some other form took over
[1:29:55] and I kept reading and right across
[1:29:57] there I saw the coming of the
[1:30:01] Lord I'm just tell you what I saw all
[1:30:04] right and that's what I try to preach
[1:30:07] cuz I saw like the United States and
[1:30:08] like the old uh Pony Express When They
[1:30:13] Carried the mail you know and how they
[1:30:15] You' seen movies where they put the Pony
[1:30:17] Express guy you know and he runs to Utah
[1:30:19] over into Arizona and then he you know
[1:30:21] the hores that's what I saw but you you
[1:30:24] know what I saw I saw each state with a
[1:30:27] little light in
[1:30:30] it that was the coming of the Lord
[1:30:33] right but listen
[1:30:36] Church those Visions can be tampered
[1:30:40] with by Satan right that's right he can
[1:30:43] impersonate all of them but there's one
[1:30:46] thing he can't
[1:30:48] impersonate he cannot impersonate the
[1:30:51] second coming of Jesus Christ he knows
[1:30:53] nothing about it right you say he just
[1:30:56] heard it cuz you said it that don't make
[1:30:58] any
[1:30:59] difference right if it can't be revealed
[1:31:02] to him he doesn't know what I'm talking
[1:31:04] about right I think people to tell me
[1:31:06] you need to be careful what you say cuz
[1:31:09] the devil hears it hey I want him to
[1:31:11] hear it I wish he could get born again
[1:31:14] bless him and if he got born again he'd
[1:31:16] be able to understand what I'm talking
[1:31:18] about
[1:31:20] right but he can't do it why cuz he
[1:31:22] turned it down
[1:31:24] right don't turn down the Simplicity of
[1:31:26] the new birth
[1:31:30] right do you understand Jesus appeared
[1:31:34] in the Old
[1:31:35] Testament but then he was come that was
[1:31:38] his first coming what would be the
[1:31:40] difference then in his second coming he
[1:31:42] would appear down through
[1:31:44] time on one side of the gauge is
[1:31:46] appearing the other way he's coming
[1:31:49] right but see that's a mystery that's
[1:31:52] been hidden from the foundation of the
[1:31:55] world but is now made known by the end
[1:31:58] time
[1:32:00] Prophet it is appearing and coming is
[1:32:02] two different
[1:32:04] words brother Dale you're not yes I'm
[1:32:07] looking for one of these days there
[1:32:08] something to happen and we go up in the
[1:32:10] sky right and we'll meet him in the air
[1:32:14] right that's
[1:32:16] right don't believe in getting a new
[1:32:20] body believe in this body being redeemed
[1:32:23] right you're all laughing at the
[1:32:25] hospital about it you know we were
[1:32:28] laughing a little bit today about it you
[1:32:31] know some of you who got nuts and bolts
[1:32:34] and screws Danny was here he tell you
[1:32:36] about all of The Metalist was in his
[1:32:38] body you know what in one way or another
[1:32:41] he's getting a new body he's got a new
[1:32:43] elbow he I mean a
[1:32:45] shoulder my wife's got a new knee you
[1:32:48] know but that ain't
[1:32:51] it because you could make all of it over
[1:32:54] you remember the $6 Million Man where
[1:32:56] they found a brain and a heart and this
[1:32:57] that and the other and they made him a
[1:32:59] body oh Danny he's almost on a million
[1:33:03] now you getting all these new parts but
[1:33:06] that ain't doing no good that's
[1:33:10] right cuz it's the same
[1:33:12] body my wife goes into the change she
[1:33:15] won't carry the metal with her and have
[1:33:17] to worry about the metal detector going
[1:33:19] off when she gets to
[1:33:21] Glory bless amen
[1:33:24] it'll be this body redeemed right the
[1:33:27] prophet said ever higher you ever
[1:33:30] lost right God knows about it
[1:33:34] amen that's right I know this is kind of
[1:33:37] a comical way of expressing it but I
[1:33:39] remember brother Hans is preaching one
[1:33:40] time you go take you take bass at your
[1:33:43] house over about 10 years there's
[1:33:45] actually bigger you in the septic tank
[1:33:48] than there are are standing there
[1:33:49] looking at me
[1:33:51] right said what well you wash all skin
[1:33:55] every time don't
[1:33:57] you but you see that's not what God's
[1:33:59] going to do reach down the septic tank
[1:34:01] and grab your
[1:34:02] body he's going to
[1:34:06] speak you come from the original amen
[1:34:10] because you remember how I preached
[1:34:12] it Jesus's body brother BR said come
[1:34:15] from the 16 elements of the earth and
[1:34:17] you tell me it come out of this dirty
[1:34:18] earth and I'm going to tell you I don't
[1:34:19] believe it right I don't believe running
[1:34:21] around talking about it coming out of
[1:34:22] the dirty earth right right I believe he
[1:34:25] was talking about from the original that
[1:34:27] brought Adam amen which was a word
[1:34:31] right you see why I love the word amen
[1:34:34] come on brother I love that
[1:34:37] word so what is it two different words
[1:34:40] now keep it in mind read those things
[1:34:42] over and
[1:34:44] over what appearing and then coming he's
[1:34:49] appearing but his coming is a secret
[1:34:52] amen that's right the only way you can
[1:34:54] know that secret is be a part of it
[1:34:57] right course the way we do it is about
[1:34:59] like the little
[1:35:00] boy little boy one time he was going to
[1:35:03] tell somebody something and he said I
[1:35:04] want to tell you something said it's the
[1:35:06] secret said me and Grandpa he said only
[1:35:09] one that knows
[1:35:12] it he stood there a minute and he he
[1:35:15] started crying he said you know I forgot
[1:35:18] what it is and said now Grandpa's only
[1:35:20] that knows it
[1:35:25] you see the secret coming of the
[1:35:31] Lord to take you and I
[1:35:36] away the revealing of his word right I'd
[1:35:40] like to hear your definition about it
[1:35:42] I'll be glad to sit down and talk with
[1:35:44] anybody about it around the world
[1:35:45] internet or whatever as you explaining
[1:35:47] all about the coming I don't send me a
[1:35:49] thing that he come in
[1:35:52] 63 I believe he did but that was to
[1:35:55] brother brandom
[1:35:56] only amen but I believe the reason he
[1:36:00] never spoke of the appearing and coming
[1:36:03] after the opening of the seals was
[1:36:05] because he knew what the coming
[1:36:09] was he knew the coming of the Lord was
[1:36:12] right
[1:36:14] there that's why he could
[1:36:17] say and don't misinterpret it cuz people
[1:36:20] have brother R said here stands a lamb
[1:36:23] tonight
[1:36:24] with a book in his
[1:36:27] hand and out there goes the white horse
[1:36:31] rider he said see there the white horse
[1:36:34] rider is the
[1:36:35] Antichrist but he even can say well he
[1:36:38] would say here stands God right here and
[1:36:40] you you know that's okay like I told a
[1:36:44] man up at Jeffersonville one time he was
[1:36:46] telling me he was talking to these
[1:36:47] people about brother ROM being deity and
[1:36:49] they're standing in front of the old um
[1:36:52] Armory where
[1:36:54] the PO word used to be and I looked at
[1:36:58] him I said brother if you'll tell me
[1:36:59] that that brother right there by the new
[1:37:01] birth is
[1:37:03] deity now he's not got the gifts brother
[1:37:06] around him had he's not got the things
[1:37:07] that he could do we're not talking about
[1:37:09] that we're talking about just the deity
[1:37:11] part I said if you'll tell me that
[1:37:13] brother with a new birth is deity I'll
[1:37:15] agree with you that brother ROM was
[1:37:16] deity by the new birth he said oh no
[1:37:20] brother said okay I just l left CU ain't
[1:37:25] no need talking to them you're not going
[1:37:27] to convince
[1:37:28] anybody right I've never tried to
[1:37:30] convince anybody my own family my wife
[1:37:32] or

[1:37:35] family of what I what I try to
