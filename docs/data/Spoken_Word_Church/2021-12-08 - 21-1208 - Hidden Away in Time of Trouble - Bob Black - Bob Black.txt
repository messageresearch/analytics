amen glad to be in the house of the lord this evening amen lord willem we can give you a little something to encourage you along the way in the middle of the week as you know we just got back from uh uh burying mom monica's dad and uh down there in mobile and uh thank you all for your prayers and your words of encouragement and all you've done and said and uh during this time it you know when you when you're standing next to a graveside and you're you're looking at them lowering the coffin down on the ground you start thinking things about um we got to get this person out and it you know it can't i i don't believe it's going to be too long i i wonder sometimes if you know people people passing away now if they're not going to get over there and just have to do a quick u-turn and come right back it's not going to be long at all but uh they're coming back and we gotta we gotta we need to know how they're gonna how how that's gonna happen so tonight i wanna speak on about being hidden away in the time of trouble if we turn to psalms chapter 27 and read a few scriptures tonight lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together in your word lord and we're so grateful to have our comfort lord in the time of trouble when when we see people dying and we see afflictions all around and we see people it seems like people are going crazy in the world and making horrible decisions and doing strange things and madness people killing one another in the in the schools and all sorts of things it's trouble on every hand but yet you've given us a hiding place in the time of trouble you've given us a way of escape lord we're so grateful oh god for the comfort that you've given it to us a comfort that the world doesn't know anything about lord but you've given you've given us a comfort and a joy that when things go wrong all around something within the springs up that know who will guard it this is this life is not all there is but there's so much more than what even we can see with our own eyes lord tonight i pray lord that you'll just bless this service lord god and bless and edify the people lord that they might receive and be strengthened lord and encourage tonight lord god that they'll receive something that they'll be able to fight this battle a little bit a little bit more with lord we ask your blessing upon the reading of your word and psalms chapter 27 says a psalm of david the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and failed you believe david was speaking from an experience that he had been through some stuff and he had seen god fight his battles for him and knew that there was a hiding place in time of trouble but he said though and host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life now that's that's something to desire in it amen if that's your one desire to dwell in his house not money riches fame popularity but to dwell in the house of the lord to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock you may be seated the lord had his blessing so david's talking about in the time of a time of trouble in the time of trouble we've got a promise that when there's trouble on every hand that that god is there and and you know you can begin to think really when there's trouble that's almost to prove to a christian that god is there you can trust that when there's trouble on every hand god is going to be there i i i don't have the quote on a hand but it just come to come to come to my mind now while i'm speaking there's a place where brother adam says that you can look around at the the way that the world is getting and it's getting darker and darker and more more evil and and that's a proof that's a sign that on the other hand while the world's getting darker and darker there's something moving in the bride that's becoming greater and greater and greater why because when there's trouble then god will raise up a standard he'll raise up his word and and in psalm 46 it says god is our refuge and strength a very present help in time of trouble a very present help in trouble and we can have confidence in those words that when trouble comes that god god we've got we've got a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities he knows the things that we're going through he was there at the grave of lazarus when lazarus was was was laid to rest in the grave and he knows the things that we're going through no matter what your struggle no matter what your your uh your your your lot in life the place you are in life god god whether you're a little child whether you're an adult a grown person what wherever you are god knows what you're going through and he's somebody that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmity and the bible says here in psalm chapter 27 in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock now there's there's where you get into a hiding place where he says he'll hide me in this pavilion he'll set me up on a rock there's there's your hiding place where you've got a foundation where you can rest assured knowing something i i i know what sometimes when we come to church and and we go through life but when you come to the end of the life and you come to that place where you're going down in the grave and you need to know that that the sting of death has been taken away that that christ is covered over your sins that he's that you believe that the the the everything's been paid for you've got to be set up upon a rock in matthew chapter 7 it says there's therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and what kind of a rock are we talking about we're talking about a rock of revelation what's this got to do with a rapture brother bob a rapture is going to be a revelation so that's why brother brown talks about he sets the stage when he's preaching this sermon the rapture that you you he shall set me up upon a rock you've got to you've got to your whole christian journey starts with a revelation of jesus christ everything is built upon a revelation of who he is and that builds and builds and builds until it culminates until you begin to realize i am going in a rapture you know that you're gonna take a body change the whole thing is a revelation amen now in psalm chapter 42 it says he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock now you think about think about a man think about a man or a woman we i think we all got that testimony sitting here tonight that one day in life we were walking along and our feet would get stuck in the miry clay of sin and and life and and and and we needed somebody to pluck us out and set our feet up on a rock that was something where we could walk where we could walk straight well we knew what we were doing here what our purpose was that that we knew who our mama and daddy was who our father was and where we came from and and you see you you've got to be set upon a rock if you're in a mirey clay you don't know where you're going and what life is all about but to be set upon a rock now brother madam said as you grow older as you grow older then you begin from making your first couple steps and toddle and fall and get up and try it again then you after a while you get so you can walk a straight line so you're plucked up out of the mirey clay then you're put in a place where you can begin to walk and you get you begin to grow and you begin to mature and he said now that's what we've got to do as soldiers of the cross now is the time to walk a straight line right down that highway to glory and i believe that when you're set up on that rock set up on a foundation of the revelation of jesus christ your position to be able to walk and that walk that straight like straight as the gate narrows the way and you've got you're equipped for that journey you're equipped to walk that walk now now it's what he's trying to say is that now is a time to walk that straight now is the time that we should be able to walk as mature christians now is the time that we are set up we're positioned so that we should be able to walk that way he said i do believe that we are living in the closing scenes of the history of this world i truly believe that the coming of the lord is closer perhaps than we think the coming of the i i believe it's just we're right on the cusp of seeing god moving our lives in a way that maybe we had never seen before we're right at the cusp of god doing something right right there at the edge of stepping over into glory and right there where we'll one day we'll may be in the kitchen and we'll turn around and there'll be mama and daddy or whatever your loved one's standing there and you begin to realize that something has happened in your life you are going to be changed we're right at that cusp now he said there's two you realize what we've what we've been given in this tower we've been given a message something to believe and he said there's too much supernatural vindication of god's written word of this hour for something not to be approaching us now there's too much supernatural vindication he said it's too real it would be astounding to you just to let you know that what is really taking place think about all those places where he would preach those deep sermons and say if you really recognize what was taking place now i i i surely were coming to a place where we can recognize what the purpose of the message was for to recognize what it's doing in our lives surely we come to a place now where we can walk this straight narrow and he said what the he said the message of the hour is god's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do and you see he was told he was trying to explain to the people that you hear so much about the message of the hour what is the message of the hour the message of the hour the message of the hour and martin luther's day was a way to get out of the catholic dogmas and all the works the message of the hour and john wesley's day was a message that would bring a sanctified life and the message of the hour and the pentecostal age was a message it was a promise for their day a promise of the restoration of the gifts that god promised it and the message of the hour and hour there is a fulfillment of what god had promised god promised it and when god promises anything he's going to bring it to pass god promised the message he promised he promised a messenger in this day to send us a message to give us rapturing faith and when god promises something it will come to pass why because in hebrews chapter six paul said by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie what two immutable things that god cannot lie and that god made a promise he made a promise to the seed of abraham he made a promise and when god says when god says anything it's going to happen and brother brahma said see where now we're changing we're changing dispensations in other words it's time it's time what is the dispensation a dispensation is a time block this now this time you do god is fulfilling his word in this way to martin luther and there's a dispensation moves on a little bit higher another dispensation is time it's time for this part of the word to be fulfilled and now we're in another dispensation is now it's time for the head to come it's time for the full word to be fulfilled for every promise of god that god for god promised in this age to be fulfilled to us and he said it may seem foreign to us but when we turn right back in the scriptures without even knowing where to look and the holy spirit brings out and just puts the whole word together makes the picture there to show us just the hour that we're living in what hour are we living in it's rapture time it's resurrection time it's time for the dead saints to come from the ground how do we know it's that time because the word has become resurrected in our lives we can see we can see the word being fulfilled in our midst we could you think about backing when brother branham in his day would i listen i got to listening to testimonies on youtube one day and this woman was telling about how she was she was she came into the into the meeting with brother branham and she looked down while she he was praying for her standing up there on the altar and and and she she looked down and she said i saw a wheel in the middle of the wheel there there standing and all those things that happened during his his his as he was bringing that message out we we so many supernatural vindications but now what he preached is becoming real to us it's becoming alive in us now he said he said we're at a corner it's easy when somebody turns a corner of a brick mason turns a corner starts everybody laying their bricks right down the same row like a certain denomination starts it starts rolling down the road right it's all right but when you get to them turns where you have to turn back the other way you realize what he's saying the denominations kind of get stuck on their little their little thing whatever it might be the way to baptize or whatever it is and they start they start laying down that wall but then somebody would come along like martin luther or john wesley it's time to go a little bit different way and then then here comes a prophet that says time to turn a corner turning the corner is when when you think you've got it all figured out and then somebody says well hold on there's more to the puzzle and you begin to turn a corner so many times don't we think we got it all figured out and then you hear a preacher get up behind the pulpit and share a little bit more maybe you didn't hear it a little bit but more you didn't hear before like that there's more to it and it keeps building up building up but we're turning the corner what kind of a corner are we turning we're turning the corner off because he's building he's building a body something where god can tabernacle himself in not just a straight wall but something where god can get in and live in and live through you turn into corners when you tie up all the loose ends all the things you used to hold to that used to be partial or incorrect or or just just going the wrong way or all the water baptism one god no eternal tale those were all all this you can go on a straight line but when you turn comes time to turn a corner each of those things begin to build on one another turning the corner to the headstone we're turning the corner to the seven seals we're turning the corner to christ the mystery of god revealed we're turning the corner to the masterpiece we're turning the corner to the token the true baptism of the holy ghost we're turning the corner to the true revelation of the grace of marriage and divorce brother abraham said in christ is identified the same in all generations he said usually people don't want to believe it because they're already set in their way you're turning a corner you're building a building and then get to the corner everybody's running this way they don't want to turn that corner but the building goes that way if the word says it goes that way see that's where we get those junctions of time that's where it's hard that's where that's where men had to sweat it out when you turn a corner then you get to that's why you had all these back in the back in the early days brother dale and different ones that there was a lot of fighting going on a lot of battling out because you got to sweat it out because you're turning the corner you're there's a change in dispensation you gotta you gotta you're you're struggling to find out what the truth is and that all these things have to be it's there's a lot of fighting out time and he said and who do you say this is he said we're building a building not a wall the builders want to take a line of blocks and just go straight down now any builder can build that but it takes a real master mechanic to turn a corner see when you got to cut the corner take that's the time it takes it shows whether you're you're really a stone mason or not when you can turn the corner with it and keep the continuity of the rest of the building but turn the corner now that's there's the key right there to keep the continuity where everything runs together and fits together but turn the corner to keep the continuity where you can preach daniel's 70 weeks and the masterpiece and the token and christ the mystery of god revealed and all the stature of perfect man and you have continuity through the whole thing and it all fits together the builders want to keep building on down but we're not building a builder but a building we're not building a wall but a building now what happens when you when you when you turn a corner you get all kinds of scoffers arise to say well no it can't be done this way it's not it's not going to happen it's coffers arise just like when when they were building that ezra nehemiah building that wall with with a a a a trowel in one hand and his sword in the other but why why they need that sword because there was a lot of scoffers there's a lot of people to say you shouldn't be building that wall and we're going to prevent you from building that wall and and scoffing there was scoffers and rose when brother brown began to preach those scoffers of rose and john wesley's day i was reading his dire i excerpt from his diary about how when he began to preach he couldn't preach in any church because his message was completely rejected they kicked him out until he had to preach at a field that was the only place he had to preach we believe that there will be a rapture scoffer is going to arise all christians believe that that's bible readers believe that they'll be a rapture now paul paul made a list of scoffers how many like paul's lists paul paul was very fond of list he made a list of things and it makes for very interesting reading in the bible when you go and read his list and now that he listed out all the scoffers in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents uh oh disobedient to parents we unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heavy heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from turn away scoffers in this end time when a rapture message is trying to be preached people that will arise and say well we got a form of godliness but we we don't want your power the power that we don't want the word that you're you're preaching that will be that will be able to deliver me you realize the word is the only thing that's going to keep the devil out you deny the power the devil's going to have free reign the devil is the devil can't come where the where the word is if you if you get the good man of the house in your soul the devil can't come and sit down the word is the thing that's going to keep him out but we're warned that this doctrine all the doctrines that i'm talking about the doctrines of christ the mystery of god revealed the token those things will be scoffed at and that's the thing that will bring you to a wrap to rapturing faith scoffed at and ii peter says knowing this first there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming it seems like everybody's been talking about the rapture for a long time it seems like things just keep on going and nothing really nothing is happening people are getting sick people are being buried it just keeps on going and that's exactly what the bible says that they would say saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation things just keep rolling on the sun sets every day the sun rises the next morning it seems like everything just continues on from creation and nothing's happening because they don't see it i wonder maybe tonight are your eyes open to what's happening do you see the coming of the lord that's happening right now do you see the rap do you realize you could be missing the rapture right now because the rapture the rapture is something that's taking place in you right now it's some it's not going to be like uh somebody that don't know nothing about the message and all of a sudden they hear it and the next day boom they're in the rapture no it's a process that begins something has to be built up within you something that's moving in you right now for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with the water perished they're willingly ignorant of the word the thing that will save them like caiaphas scoffing at jesus he didn't know that that the very god that they were singing about my god why is thou forsaking me at the second to psalm 22 he was in there the very god that they were singing about was out there on the cross being crucified right but yet he had an anointing he had all the all the trappings of religion the protestant and catholic church has predicted brother brown said in the last days to be blind the same thing to the scriptures with christ on the outside trying to get in but he said when you see these things begin to happen raise your head up raise up your head get ready something could happen at any time christ come for his church something could come at any time i i want to constantly be looking and expecting how how do you how do you stay prepared by constantly looking in the word and checking checking up with yourself making sure making sure that everything that you're dressed right right making sure that you've got what it takes now see when you when you come to a corner turn the scoffer is going to arise and that gets everybody upset people get upset and that's what the devil likes to do he likes to get people upset he likes to impersonate things and that how does it make people upset it if people begin to look at look at one another and how can how can this message be right with all these people living wrong and people people that i've seen in church for years doing the wrong thing and you begin to look around at other people in the church maybe that that maybe they're not genuine who knows but you know there is a there is a genuine christian there's a genuine christian there's a genuine minister there is a genuine there's a genuine truth of the bible there's a real now the devil wants to impersonate it and get you to looking at the faults and get you all stirred up with the what's faking everything why because we're turning a corner and there's going to be scoffers to rise there's going to be things happen the devil wants to get you all upset and get you looking at the wrong thing there's a genuine truth and there's a genuine rapture there is going to be a rapture but you've got to believe now brother baby said i was reading a paper about two weeks ago in tucson there were some englishmen from england had made a statement that the crucifixion of our lord jesus christ was only fate between pilate and jesus just to make himself something and and and there's no way that we could disprove that to them because all the things of god is to be received by faith you know so many times that's what the believe the sign crowd and all that they're trying to they're trying to prove out things how many people died on the bridge and how they're trying to prove things out by intellectual conception but it's got to all be by faith what's that got to do with the rapture brother bob the rapture is by faith faith is a revelation amen when god gives you a revelation that is faith and he's building you up that's what the word is for the word received in a heart that will open the door to it becomes faith as you receive it it gives you equips you with something and god quickens that and gives you the true interpretation of it putting all the pieces together and then it builds up and builds up within you god is building up something he's making a building brother says we're moving on beyond pentecost the message that went forth in the englishman try to hold that same message for today that won't work today it won't work because of god's building up a building he's building up something and today we our last great reformation was pentecost and today we're moving from that that's that's a a statement that has caused a lot of distress and upset and the message that we're moving beyond pentecost not we're not moving beyond the pentecostal experience back there after right right after jesus down in the upper room we're not moving beyond that we need to be born again but we've got to move beyond that pentecostal denominational idea we're moving beyond that today we're moving from that and the pentecostal message won't mix with this because it's another day it's all the word of god but it's building it's forming a bride for the rapture he said and what was the holy ghost given for now in this age that we're living this age it's beyond pentecost pentecost has settled itself into organizations and started faking a whole lot about organizations started impersonating a whole lot about organizations we are this and we are that a lot of faking going on he said that's just nature you just can't help but it's nature they'll do that it's the plan for them to do that but the church has moved on it's gone into greater more powerful now you think about that it's going into greater more powerful where maybe before there was a lot of jumping around like like i love that illustration that brother brother wade gave of the the bones coming together where when you first start out there's a lot of noise going on but you keep moving on the signals in the flesh coming in coming on towards speaking and and it gets quieter and quieter because some but but they're even though maybe it looks like it's quieter it's getting more powerful more powerful listen you don't have to jump around and shout at the devil to make it move but all you got to do is speak the word give it the word the word is what will make the devil move the word is may what will make your life conform you don't have to jump around and shout and make a lot of noise but the word sometimes in the quiet the quietness is the where the most power is but the church has moved on it's gone into greater more powerful it's the restoration of gifts and many pentecostal people does not believe in divine healing ministry of angels and powers of god because they didn't move on now now what what did brother branham say in the invisible union of the bride of christ he said god let it die because when they didn't move on then god let it die he let it die how how do you want to see the the old you die keep moving on move on and you'll see it die god will let it die you keep moving on he said many pentecostals call these visions that i see the devil think about that the pentecostals that that at one time in their dispensation their little slot of time had the truth but they didn't keep moving on and they called it called the called the word of god the devil many organizations won't even have nothing to do with it in pentecost see we move beyond that just as methodists called pentecostal crazy for speaking in tongues but it's all a coming forth of the holy spirit till the great church is being filled up and chugged full of the great powers of almighty god until it's got to a place until the very works that jesus done has manifested itself right in the church now we're close friends now what does that mean that means that life that that life there you'd see a little spark and and eat as it moved up the stalk moved up that wheat plant a little spark and then it would look like it was dying out as they denominated spark up spark up until finally it got to the wheat germ and when it gets to the wheat germ there ain't no dying out then you die out to yourself as it ripens and you see that life begin to mature in the wheat plant and begins to bow over and humble itself and then you can take that wheat germ and throw it up in the gardener and it ain't gonna rot you can throw it over you can't do that with the with the leaf you can't do that with the root or with all the different other parts of the of the plant you throw it on the ground and it's going to rot it's going to it's going to fade away and nothing but that that's that seed the wheat germ you can throw it over there on uh set it over on on the chair and in the yard wherever in in the garner it's going to keep it's going to keep and that's why it will never denominate because it's back to the original grain you've got the original life there you got something that's eternal there you got the original thing back so now now you see that's what brother ram is talking about that's what's going to bring a rapture when you're back to the original i love how he said filled up and chugged full filled up and choked full of the power of god that's what's in that little wheat that little grain of wheat filled up and choked full now brother ryan said he said just like life going through a stalk of weak it louisa leaves the wheat the whole but the wheat forms itself like the grain of wheat that fell in the ground like the original one and once the original the original is the son of man that walked around doing and performing the will of god he knew who he was he knew what his purpose was he knew what he was supposed to do so when it comes all the way through that through that plant until it comes back to the original back again to what the son of man now see god he said in every a in every age god a lot of believers god allotted his word out to each age and each one of those age has to manifest that and he also ordained men for that age to fulfill that word that means in john wesley's day there were people that were he knew before the foundation of the world they were going to believe john wesley's message when pentecost came he knew that they were going to believe in the restoration of the gifts and you think about that now that god before the foundation of the world knew that you would be sitting in this church he knew that when you picked up a message book that you'd be like this this is the truth he knew that you would do that and he had a preacher there for you he had a messenger there for you to preach the gospel so that you would hear it because he knew you would want it he knew you would believe it every time listen to this every time he lauded his word he lotted a man for it when he lot in moses time he lauded moses to it when he lauded the time for the son of god to be born he allotted him to it every age he's allotted his man four ordained as the bible says god is infinite almighty all-powerful omnipresent omniscient why he knowed all things from the beginning so he knowed he knowed there's nothing out of cater it's just us that thinks it is it's everything you run now if we can have trust that he knows we can have trust we can trust that time is marching on according to his to his great plan he's waiting for the he's waiting for all that are going to receive to be born to come to a place where they can hear he's waiting for for people to get together and have families he's waiting for us to come to a place where where we'll we'll get desperate for the word and we'll start digging in he's waiting for us he's waiting on us he's waiting on us to pack the word in and and and and get to a place where where we're more concerned with the word than we are with money and popularity and work and and and what our boss says and and when we get home we don't sit down and turn on netflix and see what the movie of the week is but we open up our bible and start packing that in he's waiting on that he's waiting on us for the rapture the rapture is in our hands because we've got all the tools we've got everything we need to take a body change we've got a message and there's not going to be another messenger we're at the end of the wheat plant it's time to to to to get an understanding which is why he said look back in his word and see what he's doing look back in his word and see what he's doing then we'll have an understanding that's what the scoffer the scoffers are looking at intellect they're trying to understand through intellect but it's not by intellect it's by revelation by revelation to know that those men those men that back in the early church they they died for something his disciples that they died and martyred them for something they believed in something it wasn't just an intellectual intellectual conception that made peter want to be uh crucified upside down it wasn't just the intellectual conception that andrew made andrea to be crucified on that that x the andrews cross it it wasn't just the intellectual conception that paul paul was willing to have his head severed from his body that's not just an intellectual conception but they believed it wasn't just something that they had in their head that's why we don't we don't believe moses just passed over a sea of reeds and all these things that the scoffers throw out because it's a revelation to know that god's word is true and that these men were fighting and living and dying for something that was real something that they really believed in now see that's what brother branham was getting at when he said the spiritual application the people don't get it well they can listen to the to the message maybe sit in a message church for just a little bit and and it just goes over their head because they're they're listening from an intellectual standpoint instead of waiting for god to bring a spiritual revelation he gave the example of how that that this man this astronaut got in a rocket ship and he flew up he flew up to the to the um i'm trying to remember who it was so i could think what he did he went to outer space and and he said uh he said they thought god he he said here i got the quote here he said i i see no god up here you're a gregarian that that russian astronaut one of the first people that went to space he flew up into space and he said i see no god up there up here and so brother brown said that turned all it shook all these ministers up they because they thought they their intellectual conception was that god was sitting up there but what would he be doing sitting up there and like on the moon with a chair or something or floating around in space but their intellectual conception was that if this scientific astronaut with a lot of education went up in space and said that there's no god up there then oh my out of wonder if there really is a god because they didn't know that god is right here god is nighty even in thy mouth god is living in his people god's not way out there on the other side of the universe he's he's right here with us that's the whole point of in the time of trouble you can trust that god is with you that god is near you he's not going to leave you he's not going to forsake you that's actually a promise in the bible and they didn't they were trying to understand god with their intellectual conception and they failed to see it he said our civilization that's the difference between the head and the heart the head tries to reason it all out and you see you see why he's laying it out you're not going to go in the rapture with an intellectual understanding but it's going to be an understanding from your heart not because you've been schooled you've been to message school but because you've got a relationship with god that you know god for yourself you have a personal relationship with him now he said our civilization that's coming on will have nothing to do with this civilization at all what's the difference this civilization is an intellectual civilization a civilization where you got to go to school to get a job a civilization where your mind is all about your mind you it's all about the things that you know and and those sort of the things that you know by intellectual conception but there's another civilization that's coming that will be from the heart that will be a civilization a supernatural civilization where you don't get sick you don't have to you don't have to labor in the way that we do now it'll be such a higher order of civilization he said there'll be a different civilization into this civilization and this scientific world we got more science scientific we get further we go into death things traps to kill and everything and that new civilization there'll be no death no sickness sorrow or no pain there won't be none in there so this civilization will have to be destroyed because it's of the devil you see why the bible says if you love this world of the things of the world the love of god is not even in you if you look around at this civilization and think this is wonderful this is glorious i heard i heard a minister preaching a while a while back about how that that the things are that you see around you for some will be the closest that they ever get to heaven and for others it will be the closest that they ever get to hell because this is your deciding ground and the great things that you see in this civilization for some will be the great the closest they can get to heaven you go to disney world and see all the palm trees for some that might be the closest they can ever get to what heaven will be like but other others on the other side that all the heartache and despair and seeing your loved ones go into the ground and that will be the closest you'll ever get to hell all the despair and and having to fight for your for for to pay your bills and all that this is the deciding ground we're talking about civilization so we're going to a higher civilization that's not based upon what all your intellectual but based upon a revelation of a living god a revelation to you satan's revelation was in genesis chapter 4 civilizations people started building towns and cities and so forth and instruments of music and becoming science but god's civilization was when seth's people come on they began to come on and call on the name of the lord they wanted to be able to worship god in the right way and sacrifice in the right way and and come to him in the right way so that they could return back to him but satan's civilization will always take you further away from god and all civilization will has got to be judged by something it's got to be judged by some now why when you go read in revelation and it starts talking about the son of man the son of man is the judge why is that because the son of man is the word and all civilization has got to be judged by the word the word is the judge he said all civilization will have to be judged by something we find out in this day when this great scoffing and making fun of the bible and trying to push it out god has got to judge the church by something and the church that's why when you come to church you're seated at the judgment seat of christ because you're being judged you're sitting here and you're suffering judgment now as the word is going over the pulpit whenever we come to church we're being judged am i a christian am i living right do i have the right to take communion it's my life worthy of the gospel and the word's going forth and it's lining you up to see whether or not whether or not you're right because the word is the judge and many times we try to judge one another and we'll point fingers and things with our own intellectual understanding but the word is the thing that judges us he said they can't go down this street and arrest me and say i'm making 30 miles an hour and i'm 30 miles on unless there's something there to tell me that i'm i'm only allowed to go 20 miles it has to be there and that's the word god is going to judge the church that's why he said if he judged by the baptist then the methodist would go to hell if he judged by the see how he i don't know how he put that because so many times we want to point the finger and send everybody else to hell but he's judging by the word it's not our own ideas he's judging us by the word if he's going to judge us by the methodist the baptist is lost he judge it by the oneness the two twoness is lost what's he going to judge it by he said he would judge it by christ and christ is the word so it's the word of god that god will judge and the word without we any creeds or dogmas or ideas that's that's the word that's going to judge not not you know martin luther sitting there and preaching preaching the little bit of revelation he had but then tossing out the book of esther in the river and saying well that's not that's not the word of god that that you see the word of god is what he's going to judge by now that martin luther threw the book of esther in the river but he in that day he you see what i'm you see the point i'm getting at it's the word not our little ideas that are mixed in but the word so brother now listen i'm walking you through this this this little study on on the rapture the rapture and he said now during the talking about getting out our little ideas because the word is what's going to judge us and he said during the feast of unleavened bread when they'll kill that sacrificial lamb there was to be no leaven among them through the entire seven days why because because because once the lamb was killed then you got to get all your living out right you got to get it all out so then you come to a place where there's no unbelief everything had to be unleavened that represented the seven church ages that we get in the book here and there's no leaven so down through the seven church ages god is working out all our unbelief by the word amen because the word is what's going to judge us we can't we don't we don't want to hold over if there's a new there's always a new message coming forth down through the seven church ages there's always a new message so you don't hold over from the previous there's a new message coming forth and a new thing a revival goes forth and the first thing you know within about three years they start an organization over he said this has been sweeping for 20 years now and there's no organization and there never will be this is the yen the wheat has come back to the wheat again the wheat has come back to its grain the shook has pulled away from it and the wheat must lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened and all the while the church world is scoffing and scoffing and saying you don't know what you're talking about it's not true despite the fact of all the things that that god has has used to vindicate the pillar of fire being visible in pictures and photographs and and pillar fire being visible in meetings and campaigns and all all the things but to the church world scoffs but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture the rapture is a revelation i'm just i'm just going to slow down and take my time so amen i know sometimes it gets a it'll be a little bit of hard hard to with with it with some meeting meeting us but we'll we'll just we'll just be slow and yeah and take our time tonight now now so the rapture is a revelation now what's the revelation though now in hebrews 11 paul said now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so now i'm hoping for a rapture you get to where you're hoping for a rapture but when now when a revelation comes you know that it's it's gonna happen you know that you're you know you're not going in the grave you know that you're going in the rapture not now i'm not talking about you know that you're born again i'm not talking about that you've got confidence in the message i'm talking about that you know that you're going in the rapture that's why it says faith is the substance of things hoped for maybe one time you hoped that you were born again but then faith came and it was the substance of that and what is the substance it's something that's real it's real that even though even though maybe you can't see it yet if you if you're hoping for your healing and then you've got the substance of it even though maybe it's not manifest in your body you've got it because it's the substance so you're not you're not looking for it anymore you got it and now you're just now you just got to go through the motions of walking into it because faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so christians not looking at things that we can see because if you were you'd look around and you say well like like all the scoffers the scoffers where's the evidence of his coming where's the evidence that it's real but faith is the substance you know that it's true because it's been revealed to you now maybe you know maybe you like like sister shepard kind of wondering if she was really born again but as the world begins to build up and build up build up you come to a place where well something's taken place in my life it comes to a place where all the doubt is moved away and and that's the same thing with the rapture there comes a place as it's built up within you there's going to come to a place somebody told me years ago uh just kind of sharing i i i think it was brother dale that when the seals are opened up to you fully and they're full manifestation when the seals are fully opened up to you you're going in rapture because it's a revelation right now it's it's a it's a revelation you have the substance of that of that thing that you hoped for now you got it and you're not going to die when you got the substance when you got the substance of that thing and he said you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something revealed to you faith is a revelation amen faith is something that has been revealed to you like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so that's what faith is is the revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body now a revelation is not something a minister gives to you that's why jesus told peter fl blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee flesh and blood didn't give it to you that's why ministers can't tell somebody i think you're born again because it's got to be something god shows to you i i don't want to tell somebody they're born again or they're not born again let god reveal it to you let god convict you if you're not born again let god reveal it to you if you are born again because it's going to be a revelation all the way i can't tell you you're going to take a rapture but if god tells you that then it's revealed then you've got the substance of it right so then you look now all the secret of all these things is in that final book in the bible the book of revelation the revelation now that book has been sealed for all these years people could look at it and probe and they didn't know what it meant because it's sealed is sealed up just for a special group of people as seal brother brown said the book of revelations is the last book of the bible it's sealed to unbelievers that's why you don't hear you don't hear anybody hardly preaching about it outside of the message because they can't they they can't understand it they read the seven churches they read about the seven seals and and the seven thunders and the seven vials and the seven plagues and it's all a mystery and go on all through the bible the things past the first first first five chapters and my you get into some things that is sealed it's sealed to unbelievers we realized then that it was all together given for believers what was it given to you for for faith to given to given to you for so that you can have faith and and and he said now that book was written but then remember it was sealed with seven seals and these seven seals was not to be opened until the sounding of the last earthly angel on earth revelation 10 7 and in the days of the sounding of the last angel's message seventh angel the mystery of god should be finished in that age and that's the age we're living in so now what's going to give you rapturing faith rapturing faith lies in the message the rapture of faith because rapturing because the message is is giving you the correct interpretation of that book of revelation and in that book of revelation is the mystery of the seven seals and the mystery of the seven seals is the seven thunders because the seven thunders all those mysteries that are contained in the seven seals are y'all still with me [Laughter] i know there's a lot of information y'all hang on just a little bit yeah that's right yeah no just chew the cud sometimes you gotta regurgitate a little bit now on us some more so i'll go slow he said we all know we're living in the layout of sea age there will never be another age to it so we're living in the laodicea age and these seven seals this hail that book is a mystery to people should be open at that day and he said this rapture that we're talking about is only for the bride amen yes sir the seven seals reveals to you it gives you rapture and faith now now this is how brother brown said how the rapture this this is my my notes how the rapture is going to happen he outlines in the middle of this in the middle of this of this sermon how it will happen and and how it will happen you think i'm about to say you'll be walking down the street one day and blah blah blah no no now listen okay he goes back back he said years before you were born you were in a fought your father as a gene through a bedding ground through holy wedlock he becomes in the image of me i know him i can fellowship with him and he come just at the right time when it's the right time now so were you in if you've got eternal life you were in god before there ever was a world you are a part a son of god an attribute of god he knowed the very age you were coming he predestinated you to that age to take that place and no one else can take it care how many impersonations he's and think so he see he's going all the way back to the back before where you were just a thought and he starts bringing it down here it comes here it comes one day one day uh everything was situated right on earth your mom and dad was here and then and and he's bringing it on down you you were born and it comes you you heard the gospel he said he predestinated you to that age you've got to be there because he knew you would be there now you are made manifest now you can fellowship with him and that's what he wants now in the beginning way back way years before there was a time began you if you are a born-again christian tonight you were in god then your father that's why when you come into this life here and profess christianity everything going wrong you've wondered why this is and all this you wandered at it but one day something struck you amen what was it the life that was down in there from the beginning from the beginning the one life the life that god knew the potential that you were born sin and shape of that iniquity but god knew one day one and when you heard the word something sprang forth and he said it was a voice that you realized that that's the thing that fear the voice that's that's the same thing that happens with a with a baby with the mama and daddy get together and and want the cells come together and then one cell adds to the other one on top of the other something begins to form and before long you've got a crying baby and then it keeps continuing it keeps building and building and building until before long you've got an adult man standing there and that's the same that's how the rapture is going to happen that's how it's going to happen he said that's the way every born-again christian when you come i don't care how many denominations you join how many names you put your name on the books and things when that real word of god is vindicated and made true before you like that you realize you're an eagle right there because all this clucking of the hen you join this and join this and go this way and that way it's nonsense it's a genuine adding word to word amen now see then he goes back to a little baby he said when a germ comes into the womb of the female it don't take on it it don't take on cells from a dog or a cat or something it's taken on what its parents are what what it is a human it's taking on human human human say and he's talking about how that when you eat the word you are becoming the word as you eat the word and what you're taking on is what you're feeding on what you're taking on you're actually becoming the word until you become the stature of a perfect man built up in his image he said it was all human germ and the body of jesus christ the bride will be part of his body he was the word and the bride will have to be the word word added to word add to word it's got to be word on top of word germ on top of journal life on top of life to bring out the full stature of the bride of the lord jesus christ it's the word that's doing it it's the word that is changing you it's the word that cast out the devil so you could be missing the rapture even as we speak if the if you're missing the word you people get so worried about missing the rapture as though it's just this one event that just kind of drops down but you could be missing it right now and not realize he said it's god's life it's god's life quickening the word so how do we get into this body by one spirit we're all baptized into the body it's the life the life in that body the spirit that's bringing us all into rapture he said you can never beat nature nature always testifies god runs in continuity with nature it has to look at the trees how they put forth their leaves everything that they do now we find out the leaves drop off the tree go back what the life goes down to the root of the tree is that the end of it comes back next spring with new life now see what now he's talking about the resurrection he's talking about you know you you if you've got eternal life and you go down into the grave you're coming back because you can't keep the holy ghost down you can't keep that life down it's got resurrection power in it so you put you put somebody down in the grave and they're coming back up and you put life and and those that shall remain you put if they've got eternal life you can't keep them down either they're going to be changed and the life that's in them will not prevent those that are asleep because it will be it will match the life of the son of man the word for this day is what's changing us he said the message goes through is heading on up into the wheat that's the reason the wheat come up and brings the whole thing in the rapture up here at the top so how's the rapture going to happen it grows and grows and grows just like just like from from a thought from a thought way back when where you couldn't even see nothing it matured until now there it is in front of you word upon word upon word building up bringing the whole thing in the rapture up here at the top now he said enoch was the seventh from adam and took a rapture the seven church ages in revelation 3 and then a door open in heaven the church said and then the seventh angels message while he was making his proclaiming his ministry then when he began to sound forth his ministry see he's talking about he's talking about the the message that he proclaimed is what's going to take us in the rapture jesus when he started out started healing the sick and afflicted oh that's great rabbi he's a prophet everybody wanted him in his church but when he sat down one day and said i and my father are one that was different amen the word come to a place turning a corner coming to a place where where now he started to preach his message that was different he didn't explain it and he didn't have to explain nothing those disciples might not have been able to explain it but they believed it whether they could explain it or not they sat right still and believed it he said when the seventh angel begins to sound the mysteries of god was to be made known right there the mysteries of god what because what's this what's it culminating in it's culminating in the son of man the revelation of the son of man god revealed in flesh again walking in the flesh of his bride and he said now that's the age that we're living in right now the seventh church age it's all to be manifested in the grain of wheat at the end coming back when the son of man begins to reveal himself now he said what is reveal make his revelation of what he is in this day reveal out to the people the word that's made known for the day to reveal out for to the people the word that's made known for the day reveal to the people by the manifestation of holy spirit making that jesus live among us that same jesus that was planted in the ground is now back living in us again here we see it the son of man coming among his people and doing just exactly confirming his message as he said he would do here we find it in this last age now so then he gets to the point of the rapture amen in second or first thessalonians chapter four for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven he's coming down he's coming down to get us with a shout out with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first man i want people to see this so bad amen what this is talking about amen then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together and and that word called up that means escape in other words god's gonna snatch us out of the trouble called up he takes us out we're in trouble and he just comes and gets us out of here called up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words that's a comfort now it's a comfort to us that that there's an escape out of here and whether you die or whether you stay there's a way out and he said three things happened the word sarah says here in second thessalonians he said second thessalonians but first thessalonians that there is three things a shout now what's the message what's the now now if you there's patterns all the way through the scripture patterns now if you can follow the pattern then you'll see you'll see something i'm not going to take too much longer so don't get nervous that i'm going to be keep it till till nine o'clock or anything just hang on with me just a little bit longer but a shout is the message going first forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride a shout goes forth first and then something else has to happen amen something else has to happen now he told my god uses that spirit of elijah five times and laying out the foundation of the prophet had to come and and when the ecclesiastical group would get everything all mixed up he would send a prophet raise him up from nowhere he belonged to none of their situations and speak his word a prophet that would speak his word that's the shout out a message the shout he said nobody set before prophet because he was absolutely the word of god he was that word in his day you seen god reflect now god has promised to send us that again in the last days to bring the bride out of that ecclesiastical mess and the only way it can be done and when the shout went forth it announced it because the bible says at midnight there was a cry made and what was that cry go go out to meet the bride group because it's time for a marriage that the invisible union of the bride of christ is time for a marriage so make sure that your lamps are trimmed what's the lamp what's lamp trimming time lamp trimming is to make sure that your light is glowing as bright as possible make sure that you actually got oil in your lamp because the lamp trimmers that that worked on boats on ships they would go and they would fill up the lamps with oil and make sure there was oil in there and then they would trim off the burnt end of the of the of the of the wick so that you wouldn't get all this smoke and everything they would make sure that it was burning real bright so when you when you hear the shout go forth you want to make sure that you're listening to that word to that message you get into christ there's not a word written he said if you're in christ there's not a word written in here but what you believe it because you're trimming your lamps you want to make sure that you're right it's the whole point that he's trying to make is the main heart of it is the message there's what it is what comes from it here he said when i went forth into the meetings with you praying for the sick it was fine now this is his words but when i come with a message the message he's trying to get the favor of the people so they'll sit and listen to him he's trying to get the favor through all the the prayer lines and all of the discernment and all that trying to get people to just sit and listen to him to listen to what he has to say now you if you really learn how to study the message i believe we study the message in this church to really sit and listen is not having it playing in the background while you're doing something else but to actually just sit there and listen to what he's saying when he says when he says in the seventh seal now last night something opened up and something opened up today go back and listen to what he said in the sixth seal he said something opened up last night go back and listen take notes and highlight things if he said something opened up today think about what that is that opened up today and think and meditate on it amen he's trying to get the favor of the people so they'll sit and listen to him why because the word preached is what's changing our bodies the word is what's closing the gaps in our understanding the word is what's coming together to give us power the word is producing a bride that won't be one word off some of the grain wheat fell on ground the birds picked it up and others fell among thorns the bible says and some was went on prepare ground pre-prepared ground and brought forth i'm going to say it like this brought forth the voice brought forth now now see listen you it's almost like it's almost like you got you've got two messages when the angel came to gabriel and said you're going to have a child you're going to have a child then brother brown preached that message why it had to be shepherds then there had to be shepherds there to announce the birth there had to be shepherds there to come and see that he was born and now see it's almost like two messages there was a message that went out he's coming and then a message that somebody caught the revelation of it to proclaim that he's here and that's the voice that he's here whose voice is it the son of man and the voice of the son of man proclaims that he's here so when you catch the shout there's got to be a shout but when you catch what that shout is it becomes real to you it's manifested in your life then the preachers can preach a different way because now they're preaching that it's not something that we're looking for it's not something way off but he's here and they're preaching so just like john when in in the book of revelation when he took the book and the bible says in that chapter that it must be prophesied again it's got to be spoken again what now now what are you speaking again you're speaking the same thing but now it's a present tense reality that that thing that was introduced is now here the voice now it's the first thing is the sounding shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of the resurrection that resurrection voice the same voice that a loud voice in saint john that lazarus from the great the voice of the son of man the son of man is the resurrection sign the one because he's the fullness of the word he's able to get the bodies from the ground to rise the dead from the ground the resurrection of the dead a resurrection of the sleeping bride and brother brown said we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen what happens when you're ripening of that life is coming forth the life is being expressed until until it's not just something that you've heard about but it's something it's a real revelation the life of the son of man expressed in you he said i've always preached that he was deity not just a man he was god manifested in the flesh god the attribute of god of love the greatness see what he's talking about the son of man displayed here on earth of god jesus was god's love which built a body that jehovah himself lived in he was the fullness of the godhead bodily what god was he manifested through that body that body had to die so he could wash the bride with his blood not only is the bride washed forgiven now see that body died so he could wash this body so that he could watch the bride with his blood you see what he's talking about the voice but he begins to start talking about the bride he begins to talk about he said now the bride is washed forgiven she's not only washed forgiven but she is justified how she justified because the word has washed her and cleansed her and made her to a place where now she's matching what god wanted her to be she's born of his bone and flesh of his flesh life of his life the same thing you see what now you can proclaim the voice is proclaiming that that thing that life that was prophesied of now is here now it's here it's not something that we're hoping for but now we've got the substance of that thing maybe even though you can't see a lot of shouting and jumping around but yet in the quietness and stillness of a perfect revelation that life is here the son of man is here he said the blood of jesus christ cleanses us so from sin until it's put in the book of god's forgiveness he's the only one can do it amen we can't we can forgive but not forget right i could forgive you but i always remember you done these evil things then you're not just you're forgiven but in the sight of god the bride is justified she never done it in the first place standing there married to the virtuous son of god she's married to him now never sinned in the first place when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her and she stands there virtuous see she no sin on her at all therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout and what what is the voice brother ryan said in in the patmos vision way back in 1960 he said what is his voice it's the judgment the voice of the ministers through the holy spirit that's crying out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many waters cried out thickness and multitudes the voice of those seven stars in his hand to every church age preaching the baptism in the holy ghost the baptism in jesus name speaking in tongues the power of god the resurrection of christ the second coming divine judgment the voice of many waters came forth from this one that looked like the son of man many waters his voice he said in the voice of the sign there has to be human flesh on earth to speak his voice i am the vine you are the branches there's no way of getting around it friends that's just scripture it's the truth the spoken word the spoken word is the original seed and the word has got to be spoken the word has got to be spoken out now you see you see if you can look at this pattern there's the trumpet there's got to be something between that shout out between the shout and the trumpet which is the voice and brother i said the trumpet with the sound of a trumpet and when it does it caused always a trumpet called israel to the feast of the trumpets calling israel to the feast of the trumpets so between the shout between this message going out and between the israel coming back and beginning to get a revelation of who they are and what christ did for them between that span there's going to be a bride that realizes who she is there's going to be a bride to come to the fullness of the revelation i'm trying to find a place to close here he said we've had three witnesses three is a witness the bible says in matthew 18 16 if he will if he will not hear thee and take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established and there was three raptures in the old testament as a witness that the rapture is coming because god promised it enoch was one elijah was the other one how did enoch take a rapture brother brown preached about how the enoch he said i did everything that you told me to do now you can apply that to your own life i was born again because you told me i needed to do it i climbed up the statue of a perfect man because you said these virtues are required i come to the capstone because it was promised for this age you've come because and you've done just like enoch did i've done everything that you told me to do elijah was the other one jesus was the other one he said the word of the lord came to enoch the word of the lord that's how you go in the rapture the word of the lord came to elijah his prophet and the word of the lord was jesus now there's three raptures in the new testament the old testament saints the bride and the two witnesses and and jesus when when he was there on the cross i'm going to kind of hurry through this part he said when he cried again with a loud voice there's that voice again as he cried on the cross and the old testament saints rose up from the grave and they walked around in jerusalem and and people began to recognize him he said because of that voice there on the cross as he died he cried with a loud voice his loud voice awakened the old testament saints just exactly like the loud voice awakened lies were see the loud voice awakened they had offered the sacrifice to lamb and when he died and yielded up the ghost he screamed with a loud voice and the old testament saints awoke watch the shout and the voice over here the same thing that is coming there's a voice that will wake the sleeping saints what is that voice the life of christ revealed in his people being preached the way he wanted it to be preached being lived lived voices lived out and you and i and it's got to draw the sleeping dead from the ground and in first thessalonians for this we say unto you the scripture that we're preaching on that we which are alive and remain under the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shall that's the second rapture and in revelation 11 and they heard a great voice from heaven the two witnesses they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up heather and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld him what is it in all these cases it's the word of god the word of god received by these people and received to a place where they were called up he said the third one is the two witnesses of revelation 11. in first thessalonians then we which are alive and remain shall be called up and that word in the greek means to take by force to pl pull to seize claim for oneself equally snatch out or away you think about god wanting to just claim us all at once to snatch us away and he said now now the musicians can go ahead and come we'll close on this he said now we're ready now we're ready we're ready waiting for the raptures the rapture of the saints it's been spoken and so shall it be when god says anything all heaven and earth will pass away but that word will never fail you think about way back then he said now we're ready and and now i believe we can read that we can read with that with the correct interpretation of the message the correct understanding of what we're doing here and read that and i believe we can truly say now we're ready do you believe that with me tonight let's let's stand to our feet and just worship worship the lord 254 in a sparrow oh beautiful star of bethlehem [Music] [Music] the place where jesus lay oh beautiful star of bethlehem the
