[24:50] right
[24:50] Lord be with us and blessing that'll be
[24:54] going to do part of his sister service
[24:57] so we give him a give him a day off from
[25:01] here anyway so good to be here in the
[25:04] house with Lord you can congratulate Jim
[25:07] when she gets up here because today's
[25:08] our 40th wedding anniversary
[25:11] [Applause]
[25:13] we were we were at the shows of festival
[25:17] yesterday and the lady was giving her
[25:19] condolences that anyway she said well I
[25:24] don't have to go through that forty
[25:25] again that's good that's a blessing but
[25:28] you know I was thinking coming up the
[25:29] road we live 20 years without the Lord
[25:31] the first 20 and we've lived the second
[25:33] 20 with the Lord in our life and to say
[25:36] it's been easier you can't really say
[25:38] that but you know how to handle it
[25:40] when you have the Lord in your life you
[25:42] really a lot of things you didn't know
[25:43] what how to handle when you didn't have
[25:45] the Lord in your life but we're just
[25:48] gonna that first 20 was was experiences
[25:52] and this 20 that we've just come through
[25:55] we've we've grown and and I tell you you
[25:59] just can't can't put a price on love
[26:03] even though it's filial love but if you
[26:06] got the agape level of the Lord then
[26:08] you'll have filial love for your wife
[26:10] because Bible tells you you you you love
[26:13] your wife this cross love you so
[26:14] remember that next time remember that
[26:19] next time whose is this Bob leave this
[26:23] up here Wednesday must have anyway at
[26:29] least it's got color to it it's not
[26:30] white but if you got your Bibles let's
[26:33] turn to the Book of Daniel let's begin
[26:34] the six fold purpose we kind of hit on
[26:36] it a little bit last Sunday but we're
[26:38] going to background for a few minutes
[26:40] and then we'll get into part two which
[26:43] we should be able to go one two three
[26:44] does anybody not have the chart that to
[26:48] give out last Sunday afternoon if you do
[26:51] not have yours raise hand
[26:55] raise it up high he's getting old he
[26:58] can't see either so just it'll be
[27:02] something we can go over the chart make
[27:06] sure you got it with you make some notes
[27:08] and whatever you want to do this
[27:10] afternoon we'll put the big chart up but
[27:12] I want us to go through all six folds
[27:16] today we'll do one two and three this
[27:17] morning and then we'll do 45 and
[27:19] sickness afternoon some very vital very
[27:22] important because it's the purpose of
[27:25] the redemption of Israel and the land
[27:28] and that's all of Daniel 70 weeks is
[27:31] really compiled in that last week of the
[27:35] redemption of Israel and the redemption
[27:39] of the land remember a couple of
[27:44] announcements October 26 I think they
[27:46] said October 26 does the Fall Festival
[27:49] done it this down at the park so
[27:52] remember that that's coming up in a few
[27:53] weeks
[27:54] November the second will be our second
[27:57] Youth Bible study will be starting maybe
[28:01] 2:30 or 3:00 o'clock instead of 3:30
[28:02] because we didn't have time to answer
[28:04] all the questions and by the way we've
[28:07] already got questions piled up for this
[28:09] one coming up we don't have to sit and
[28:11] wait on anybody they've already sent
[28:12] them to us so well the youth has got a
[28:15] lot of questions and and you know if
[28:18] there's a Bible question there's got to
[28:19] be a Bible answer and we just believe
[28:22] you know as we're going to read here in
[28:23] a few minutes that face final resting
[28:25] places then the Word of God you can't
[28:27] use and you can say that you can say
[28:29] brother around said or the Prophet said
[28:31] that's okay but put it in the Bible
[28:33] because face final resting place lays in
[28:36] the Word of God not in what any man says
[28:39] but we know for one thing's for sure and
[28:42] let it be known from this pulpit that we
[28:44] believe that brother Branham was our
[28:46] prophet there was no one else not going
[28:48] to be anyone else he is the one that had
[28:51] the word for the hour and don't think
[28:53] you can correct him that's right that'd
[28:56] be like oh man that'd be like you trying
[28:58] to you be in the first grade trying to
[29:00] correct a rhodes scholar you know you
[29:04] just be just and i'm going to use this
[29:07] word brother i'm use it i took it out
[29:08] he said stupid he said that's just
[29:10] stupid six fold purpose part two all
[29:14] right everybody good say man all right
[29:16] here we go Daniel 921 let's bow our
[29:20] heads before we get started trying to
[29:21] let let everybody get in here Lewis kind
[29:23] of pulled the trigger a little too quick
[29:26] this morning but that's okay by our
[29:29] heads family Father we thank you Lord
[29:31] for all these things you give us give us
[29:33] a beautiful and a wonderful day to serve
[29:34] you and thank you Lord for all the lives
[29:38] that are standing here today Lord
[29:39] there's many testimonies there's many
[29:41] things we've been through the Lord you
[29:44] brought us do every one we praise your
[29:47] great name for that father we pray that
[29:48] you just be with us now in the Furman in
[29:49] this service you be the active
[29:51] participant or you be the one that does
[29:53] the revealing because without you here

[29:57] meeting but lord please reveal as I've
[30:00] always asked you Lord reveal yourself to

[30:06] of glory of the bride Lord we pray that

[30:11] going Lord brother Tim meetings you'll
[30:13] bless them Lord on the highways keep us

[30:19] in Jesus name Amen
[30:20] Daniel 921 says yes while I was speaking
[30:24] in prayer even the man Gabriel who might
[30:26] send in the vision at the beginning
[30:27] being caused to fly swiftly touched me
[30:30] about the time of the evening oblation
[30:32] always happens in the evening tonight
[30:34] and he informed me and taught with me
[30:36] and said Oh Daniel I am now come forth
[30:40] to give the skill and understanding now
[30:42] remember he didn't come to give him mass
[30:43] confusion he came to tell Daniel exactly
[30:47] what he was praying for and giving
[30:49] clarity on where he was standing and
[30:51] that's what I hope and pray that we do
[30:53] today at the beginning of the
[30:56] supplications that the commandment came
[30:57] forth and I am come to show thee for
[31:00] thou art greatly beloved therefore
[31:02] understand the matter and consider the
[31:04] vision seventy weeks are determined upon
[31:07] thy people whose that Jews and upon the
[31:10] holy city Jerusalem to do six things
[31:13] we're going to talk about three of them
[31:14] today number one is to finish the
[31:17] transgression look at these words finish
[31:20] to make an end
[31:22] of sin and reconciliation for iniquity
[31:25] let's remember those Finnish end and
[31:28] reconciliation all right and to bring in
[31:31] everlasting righteousness to distill up
[31:33] the vision and prophecy and to anoint
[31:34] the most holy
[31:36] know therefore and understand that from
[31:38] the going forth of the commandment to
[31:39] restore and rebuild Jerusalem let me
[31:41] stop right here just a second when you
[31:43] go back up to 24 that is the restoration
[31:46] are the redemption of Israel in that one
[31:49] one verse everybody got that say man
[31:52] that is the restoration of Israel and
[31:55] the city is going to be done in that
[31:58] time of 70 weeks that all right say man
[32:02] well you gonna you better say a man
[32:04] called this a Bible okay all right and
[32:06] now what's going to happen in verse 25
[32:09] he's going to tell Daniel how it's gonna
[32:13] happen but he's going all the way back
[32:16] to about five 30-something BC and bring
[32:19] it all the way up and tell Daniel what's
[32:22] going on so verse 24 is it I'll read
[32:26] this quote in just a few minutes brother
[32:27] Ram said that's all that's allotted to
[32:29] Israel and that's all that's allotted to
[32:30] the city is Daniel 9:24 now 9 25 26 and
[32:35] 27 tells you how it's gonna happen so
[32:38] keep that in your mind know therefore
[32:40] and understand that from the going forth
[32:42] of the commandment to restore and build
[32:43] Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
[32:46] shall be seven weeks and threescore and
[32:49] two weeks so that's one seven week
[32:52] period and a sixty two week period the
[32:54] street shall be built again and the wall
[32:56] even in troublous times we're gonna get
[32:58] to this couple week and after threescore
[33:00] and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off
[33:03] but not for himself who was he cut off
[33:06] for not Israel they turned him down as
[33:11] for this is for us okay we'll read about
[33:14] that in a minute about the engrafting
[33:16] alright where was that but not for
[33:18] himself and the people of the prince
[33:20] that shall come now who is that Titus
[33:22] shall destroy the city and the sanctuary
[33:25] totally destroy it like it had been
[33:28] destroyed during that 70 year captivity
[33:31] there buddy got there because when
[33:34] Daniels
[33:35] when Gabriel comes to Daniel in this
[33:37] moment of time the temple and the city
[33:40] is laying desolate according to second
[33:43] chronicles we'll read that in just a
[33:44] minute okay and the end of shall be with
[33:48] a flood and to the end of the war
[33:49] desolations are determined so there's
[33:52] gonna be a war somewhere and he shall
[33:54] confirm the covenant with many now who's
[33:56] that he he is the Antichrist because God
[33:59] won't confirm a covenant and then break
[34:01] it
[34:02] this man confirms a covenant but for one
[34:04] week and in the midst of the week he
[34:07] shall cause the sacrifice and oblation
[34:10] to cease and for the overspreading of
[34:12] abominations he shall make it desolate
[34:16] he's gonna walk into the temple the Pope
[34:19] is gonna walk in this Gentile Pope is
[34:21] gonna walk into the temple and say I'm
[34:22] God oh boy
[34:25] think what's going on with those 144,000
[34:27] Jews and all the others for the
[34:29] overspreading of abominations he shall
[34:30] make it desolate so some time after that
[34:33] what he does what the what the I say
[34:38] Pope but the Antichrist does when he
[34:40] breaks that covenant
[34:41] we'll see this afternoon that's when
[34:43] you're gonna have the Battle of
[34:44] Armageddon alright and for the
[34:46] overspreading of abominations he shall
[34:48] make it desolate even unto the
[34:51] consummation now what is the
[34:52] consummation of 70 weeks of Daniel not
[34:55] when the not when the two witnesses get
[34:57] finished preaching it's when they walk
[35:00] into the Millennium that's the end of
[35:03] the consummation and that determined
[35:05] shall be poured out upon the desolate
[35:08] you may be seated in the Lord at his
[35:10] blessing to the reading of the word
[35:12] because the one attack we got a lot to
[35:14] read but really a lot of it is scripture
[35:16] for some of you that's got the quotes in
[35:18] your hand but we will we will read them
[35:21] now I want you to two less background
[35:24] just for a minute as some of the other
[35:26] ones are coming in mm-hmm we know that
[35:29] there was a prophecy given and I told
[35:31] you this in the history part of this of
[35:34] this teaching if we go to 2nd chronicles
[35:38] 36 if you'll pull it up there verse 17
[35:41] through 21 since therefore he brought
[35:44] upon him the king of the Chaldees who
[35:46] slew their young men with the sword in
[35:47] the house of their sanctuary
[35:49] and had no compassion upon young men are
[35:51] made an old man or him that's due for
[35:53] age he gave them all into his hand and
[35:55] all the vessels of the house of God
[35:57] great and small and the treasures of the
[36:00] house of the Lord that was everything
[36:01] Solomon had built everything he had
[36:03] overlaid with gold everything he had
[36:05] overlaid with silver it's going to be
[36:07] gone the temples going to be broke down
[36:10] and the treasures of the king of his
[36:13] princess all these he brought to Babylon
[36:15] and they burnt the house of God and
[36:17] break down the wall of Jerusalem because
[36:20] remember a wall is a fortification it's
[36:23] kind of like us having a security system
[36:25] but once you break that security system
[36:27] down there's no city that's safe without
[36:30] a wall back then all right because you
[36:33] got to remember this is back to the Jews
[36:35] back in into 500 BC and they burnt the
[36:39] house of God and break down the walls of
[36:41] Jerusalem and burnt all the palaces
[36:43] thereof with fire and destroyed all the
[36:46] goodly vessels thereof and I think all
[36:48] that was left over if you'll continue
[36:50] looking in the history all that was left
[36:51] over with Solomon's porch and it was all
[36:53] made out of concrete so it you couldn't
[36:55] burn it but Solomon's porch is still
[36:57] there today that's the only thing was
[36:58] left from the original temple with
[37:00] Solomon's porch and really it was just
[37:02] the steps that go up to the porch so in
[37:05] other words man we will get into this in
[37:08] a little while when we get into the
[37:09] streets being built in trouble as times
[37:11] man has always hated the Jews but they
[37:15] know if they can keep them out of their
[37:16] homeland that God's not going to deal
[37:18] with them even the Gentiles that around
[37:19] them that that's why they had a sword in
[37:23] one hand and a trial in the other hand
[37:25] they were building the wall and they
[37:27] were trying to keep the white people
[37:28] away from knocking the wall down because
[37:30] they knew if and we even know now like
[37:32] where brother brown says God doesn't he
[37:35] only deals with Jerusalem our Jews when
[37:37] they're in their homeland all right so
[37:40] what man has been trying to do for
[37:42] hundreds and thousands of years is keep
[37:44] Israel scattered well it's Satan doing
[37:47] it you know that through the people is
[37:49] trying to keep Israel scattered but now
[37:51] we see that they're back in their
[37:52] homeland and they're not going to leave
[37:54] this time there's going to be 144,000
[37:56] taken in a rapture of what's going on at
[37:58] the moment there buddy okay with that
[38:01] and destroyed all the goodly vessels
[38:03] thereof and then that had escaped from
[38:06] the stored carried away to Babylon so
[38:07] anyway the ones he didn't kill he picks
[38:10] him up and takes him to Babylon and
[38:11] Daniel or his mommy and daddy one is
[38:14] included in that bunch because he's in
[38:16] captivity now in Daniel 9 everybody got
[38:19] that same and he'd been in captivity 68
[38:22] years so so he was probably born in
[38:25] captivity and then they had escaped from
[38:27] the sword carried he away to Babylon
[38:29] where there were servants to him and his
[38:31] sons until the reign of the kingdom of
[38:33] Persia because remember this kingdom is
[38:36] cursed another kingdom comes in
[38:38] Nebuchadnezzar gets he gets destroyed
[38:41] actually remember Nebuchadnezzar God
[38:43] said you've made yourself too high and
[38:45] mighty I was just reading it the other
[38:46] day he said you're gonna eat grass for
[38:48] seven years your fingernails are gonna
[38:49] grow out and you're gonna grow hair all
[38:51] over your back and you're gonna eat
[38:52] count on me eat like a cow for seven
[38:54] years well then he comes back into power
[38:56] and then his son Belshazzar comes in and
[38:59] Belshazzar is the one that God wrote
[39:02] many many tinkle of purse in and said
[39:04] that you've weighed in the balances of
[39:06] found wanting well he dies so then now
[39:08] what happens is the Medes and the
[39:10] Persians come and take over according to
[39:12] scripture because remember chronicles
[39:14] this is written back before it even
[39:15] happens this is the prophecy everybody
[39:18] okay with that where they were serviced
[39:20] to him and his sons until the reign of
[39:22] the kingdom of Persia to fulfill the
[39:24] word of the Lord by the mouth of
[39:26] jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her
[39:29] Sabbath's remember we're talking about
[39:31] two things here the land and the people
[39:34] nobody got that say men to fulfill the
[39:37] word of the Lord by the mouth of
[39:38] jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her
[39:41] Sabbath's for as long as she laid
[39:43] desolate she kept Sabbath to fulfil 62
[39:47] and 10 which is 70 years all right this
[39:49] 70 year of captivity and remember when
[39:52] in Genesis 29 if you'll pull that up
[39:54] we'll kind of get finished get through
[39:56] this background pretty quick Genesis 29
[39:59] verse 27 it talks about fulfil her week
[40:02] and we will give thee this for the
[40:04] service which thou shalt serve with me
[40:05] yet seven years that Jacob served seven
[40:08] years for Rachel and he fulfilled her
[40:11] week which was what seven years
[40:14] so the prophet of God had to just look
[40:17] in the Bible I'm sure the angel of the
[40:18] Lord said hey have you read it over here
[40:20] and in Genesis where it says that one
[40:23] week equals seven years all right
[40:24] because you know brother Branham just
[40:26] didn't come up with that he had to get
[40:27] it out of the Bible listen brother
[40:29] Branham was a Bible prophet he did not
[40:32] now sure he looked at Larkin and he
[40:33] looked at your eyes Smith and he looked
[40:36] at all these different ones and he said
[40:37] I agree with some of them he even in
[40:38] doctor Scofield he said there's some
[40:40] things I agree some things I don't agree
[40:41] with he said and they were scholars for
[40:44] their time but see there had to be a
[40:45] prophet to tie up all the loose ends
[40:48] here's the important part
[40:49] brother Branham tied up all the loose
[40:51] ends that was loose because remember
[40:53] look Clarence Larkins chart that he drew
[40:57] before brother Branham came on the scene
[40:59] is the exact same chart that brother
[41:01] Branham drew for the Daniell seventy
[41:03] weeks but remember Clarence Larkin was a
[41:06] Trinitarian right so see that part he
[41:09] was off had to be a prophet come in had
[41:12] to be a prophet to come in to bring one
[41:14] God back in line to bring water baptism
[41:15] back in line to bring all the no eternal
[41:17] health all those things that some of
[41:19] those had probed that and missed there
[41:22] were certain things they got right they
[41:24] weren't false prophets they were right
[41:27] for their time
[41:28] moody Sankey Finney Calvin all those
[41:32] great men you listen they're not gonna
[41:34] be in hell they're their bride their
[41:37] bride okay the same way with clear
[41:39] Larkin I would say his teachings are
[41:42] well good but they're not all exactly
[41:45] right that's why we put our resting
[41:47] place on the Word of God that the
[41:49] prophet of God gave us clarity while he
[41:51] was here and left us 1100 sermons so in
[41:54] the days of the voice of the seventh
[41:55] angel when he begins to sound where's he
[41:58] gonna sound he's not gonna sound from a
[41:59] tape recorder he's gonna same for me and
[42:01] you alright just the way it is that's
[42:06] what the Bible says amen
[42:08] so face final resting place is in the
[42:10] Word of God so we take what the Word of
[42:13] God says so now let's go back to Daniel
[42:15] nine one we're still in where this is
[42:17] where Daniels prayer in the first year
[42:19] of Darius now there Sebring Darius the
[42:21] Mede Persian Chaldeans and the different
[42:24] ones it's not Nebuchadnezzar he's
[42:26] already gone off the scene and died
[42:27] once is in the first year of Darius the
[42:29] son of a source of the seat of the Medes
[42:31] which was made king over the realm of
[42:33] the Chaldeans in the first year of his
[42:35] reign I Daniel understood by books the
[42:38] number of years where the word of the
[42:40] Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet what
[42:41] was Daniel doing Daniel was literally
[42:44] reading Jeremiah's quote book he was
[42:48] reading Jeremiah sermons if they went
[42:50] out of tape-recorder Jeremiah's
[42:51] tape-recorder would have been there but
[42:53] Daniel got a revelation but you know
[42:55] where he needed a revelation from he
[42:57] needed it from God it wasn't just a
[43:00] reading it was where he the angel
[43:02] Gabriel why didn't Gabe real come to
[43:04] give him what skill and understanding
[43:05] all right
[43:06] so God sends message during this day to
[43:08] give a skill and understanding thereby
[43:11] all right with that the first year of
[43:13] his reign I Daniel understood by books
[43:15] the number of years were of the word of
[43:17] the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet
[43:18] that he would accomplish in 70 years in
[43:21] the desolations of Jerusalem and I set
[43:24] my face into the Lord to seek by prayer
[43:26] and supplication with fasting in
[43:28] sackcloth and ashes and we know the
[43:30] prayer continues down and because of
[43:32] Daniels prayer nice thing about this
[43:34] yesterday we we I don't believe in luck
[43:41] as being a Christian I don't believe in
[43:44] being lucky
[43:44] I believe in being fortunate but I
[43:48] believe we all got a choice but God knew
[43:51] what our choice was before we got here
[43:53] we don't so we continued to pray that
[43:56] some I asked brother Branham on tape I
[43:57] was listening to this brother Brown if
[43:59] predestination is like you said then why
[44:01] are you preaching he said I'm throwing
[44:03] the net he's I'm throwing the net to get
[44:06] the ones that are out there that that's
[44:08] kind of you know out in the in the water
[44:10] he said I'm throwing the net and he said
[44:12] bringing them in so they're taking here
[44:13] from God which i think is wonderful
[44:16] because predestination is you know
[44:18] preed their term and destination but
[44:21] it's because of foreknowledge that God
[44:23] knew what you would do he knew you'd
[44:25] want he knew Daniel that's what in the
[44:26] whole point is he knew Daniel as soon as
[44:28] he come to that two years left it was
[44:31] close to getting out of there he knew
[44:33] Daniel was going to absolutely open the
[44:35] windows up throw the sackcloth and ashes
[44:38] go to fasting and praying and that's why
[44:41] he had Gabriel
[44:41] standing there ready to go give him a
[44:43] message all right same way with you and
[44:45] I we were we were screaming for what
[44:47] clarity we were screaming for a profit
[44:49] because you know what we're getting
[44:50] ready to get out of here and you're not
[44:52] going to get out of here with all these
[44:53] loose ends that were left with Larkin
[44:56] and Smith and all those different ones
[44:57] we had a profit come to give us clarity
[45:00] all right so now let's look that's why I
[45:03] mean I'm telling you this because this
[45:06] is one of the most contentious doctrines
[45:11] that brother Brown ever have because
[45:13] most time when people get ready to leave
[45:15] the message the first thing they say is
[45:17] he was wrong in Daniel 7 tea leaves hey
[45:22] they just don't have clarity right
[45:25] because that you know what I it was kind
[45:28] of funny when we had the ministers
[45:31] meeting several years ago they were
[45:32] denying quotes and we were bringing all
[45:35] the quotes in and they were throwing
[45:36] quotes out okay that's what I told him I
[45:39] said I said he preached three sermons
[45:41] just for nothing no if you read that if
[45:45] you go through and look and listen to
[45:48] read Daniel seventy weeks go from Gables
[45:50] instruction seat full purpose to the
[45:51] seventh week I got laying in there it is
[45:54] the most positive the man hardly it has
[45:56] ever preached
[45:58] I'm sure this thus saith the Lord this
[46:00] has got to happen this has got to happen
[46:02] you know I mean that there you know if
[46:04] you listen to that their commentary of
[46:06] the people that get ready to leave the
[46:07] message they say it was wrong it's like
[46:09] he was and don't get me wrong a bumbling
[46:11] idiot he was not he was absolutely the
[46:14] most positive he had ever been because
[46:16] he had to get that out of the way to get
[46:18] to the seven seals which nobody had ever
[46:20] preached all right so he couldn't be
[46:23] wrong
[46:23] we just didn't understand what he was
[46:25] saying but I believe we do understand
[46:28] what he was saying and then I believe we
[46:30] have clarity we have to have clarity you
[46:32] can we're not going to get out of here
[46:33] with fear and uncertainty fear and
[46:37] uncertainty is what kept us here from
[46:39] the Garden of Eden till this day it's
[46:41] fear and uncertainty so we need to get
[46:44] rid of that so now let's start with
[46:45] number one try to get finished here by
[46:49] 11:30 and I got this afternoon so that's
[46:54] why I like this
[46:56] now there's our lesson for the next
[46:58] three or four meetings whatever the Lord
[47:01] will reveal seventy of weeks now I'll
[47:03] ask dr. Phil tonight put up my board so
[47:06] I'll be able to mark it up no we know
[47:08] I've got to I've got the chart in there
[47:10] we'll give it out next Sunday I don't
[47:13] want you to miss it now you got to study
[47:15] with me and study deeper you'll miss it
[47:16] I want to draw it out here on the
[47:18] blackboard then you bring your pencils
[47:20] and paper and write down these dates
[47:22] these times and all about it now the
[47:24] seventy of weeks begins now get this
[47:26] after the church is taken out now that
[47:30] should not stumble you because the
[47:32] charts are holding in your hand we've
[47:34] already left the building we've already
[47:37] left this earth when those two prophets
[47:40] start preaching to redeem Israel and
[47:43] redeem the city we're going all this
[47:47] other is not filler but it's just like I
[47:49] said before Daniel 9:24 is right here
[47:56] but now 25 26 and 27 you got to go back
[48:00] and get the history of how you got here
[48:02] everybody got that say ma'am the history
[48:05] of how you got right here
[48:06] if y'all would look this way I'm not
[48:09] over there I'm over here you don't mind
[48:11] I'd like some participation look I mean
[48:14] if it doesn't bother you you can just
[48:15] leave if you want to not gonna bother me
[48:17] any if you think you don't need it I do
[48:22] so I'm gonna stay right here now the 70
[48:25] weeks begins after the church is taken
[48:27] out now everybody understand that say
[48:30] Amen now after the church is taken out
[48:33] because from revelation 6:1 to
[48:35] revelations 1921 is connected with the
[48:38] seventy of weeks
[48:39] therefore we must often explain it
[48:41] before we go further we must stop in
[48:43] this plane why these 70 weeks because if
[48:45] you don't you'll miss the seals you
[48:47] mister trumpets you mr. miles what
[48:49] you'll miss the positioning of it okay
[48:52] you'll miss the positioning of when one
[48:54] comes in one goes out that's my brother
[48:56] Brown was trying to preach the trumpets
[48:58] trying to preach the trumpets trying to
[48:59] he said I'll take a whole week God said
[49:02] you already preached him spiritually or
[49:05] supernaturally in the sixth seal he
[49:07] preached the trumpets they
[49:08] preached the Feast of the trumpets which
[49:10] is a little bit different than preaching
[49:12] seven trumpets individual you know why
[49:14] because it's all to Israel we're not
[49:15] even here when it happens all right
[49:18] revelation 6:1 or 1921 is connected with
[49:21] the seventy of weeks therefore we must
[49:22] stop and explain you'll miss the
[49:24] trumpets you miss the vowels to play
[49:26] three unclean spirits like frogs three
[49:28] woes casting out the red dragon and the
[49:30] woman in the Sun you'll miss it all if
[49:32] you don't cuz it takes place right here
[49:33] in this 70th week that's this week
[49:39] you've got in your hand the chart that
[49:40] you got that's the 70th week no there's
[49:43] no half weeks in here okay there's whole
[49:46] weeks there's no half weeks in the Bible
[49:53] now the prophet Daniel had been in Bible
[49:56] in for 68 years you won't run references
[49:58] back and save yourself time of looking
[50:01] it up 68 years he went into captivity in
[50:03] BC 606 and when the vision came to him
[50:05] was what BC 538 about 38 from 606 least
[50:10] 68 68 years he had been in Babylon
[50:12] amongst heathens and still had the
[50:14] victory
[50:14] we can't stay an hour about that number
[50:19] two Gabriel's instructions to Daniel the
[50:22] Jews that we know that's not the real
[50:23] Jew the real Jews that real Orthodox who
[50:27] is not has not defiled himself with the
[50:29] things of the world who's not won out
[50:31] and joined the church's reason I'm
[50:33] reading this cuz watch that's the ones
[50:35] that's returning under living on cheese
[50:37] and bread it's not the Wall Street you
[50:40] they stayed in America they stayed where
[50:43] the money was at all right these are the
[50:45] honest ones that come back this is where
[50:47] to come back on the wings of an eagle
[50:49] remember they couldn't get on the
[50:51] airplane brother branham that was back
[50:52] then transworld airway or TWA or
[50:54] whatever it was he said we go back on
[50:56] the angle eagle's wings so they're gonna
[50:58] go back they went back over there on
[51:00] those airplanes not allowed in the old
[51:02] city had to build them a city on the
[51:03] side and a no-man's land well machine
[51:05] guns pointing both ways
[51:06] brother Dale's been there they do they
[51:08] got Palestine they got this they got
[51:09] that but she's beginning to put forth
[51:12] her buzz amen and amen the timings in
[51:14] hand there's Ishmael and Isaac stand and
[51:16] they're fussing about the land so we got
[51:19] to get the land right too
[51:22] see you and I don't have a land we don't
[51:24] have a continuance city we're looking
[51:25] for a city whose builder and maker is
[51:26] God we're not looking for a Jerusalem
[51:28] that is natural over there sure we're
[51:30] going to go over there and live but it's
[51:32] not ours it's the Jews the whole
[51:36] millennium is to the Jews will read that
[51:38] this afternoon and get some clarity on
[51:41] that I think they won't let them come to
[51:43] old Jerusalem you have to go there first
[51:45] and let them explain all that to you the
[51:47] Arabs then take you over in the other
[51:49] side that's this most children but wait
[51:51] that's coming a time when God's children
[51:53] is going to take her over that's right
[51:54] Jerusalem will be rebuilt again
[51:57] scripture says be rebuilt the daily
[52:01] sacrifice will be set up that's what
[52:02] they're working on right now and the
[52:05] Antichrist will make a covenant for them
[52:06] last 7 weeks we know that's like seven
[52:09] years it's not seven weeks we know that
[52:10] and in the midst of it he'll break that
[52:13] covenant turn them in all into
[52:15] Catholicism the abomination will spread
[52:18] over the whole thing like that and then
[52:20] the end shall be watch all right let's
[52:23] start with the fifth sixth fold purpose
[52:24] let's read it now again seventy weeks
[52:26] are determined upon thy people and upon
[52:29] thy holy city two things to finish the
[52:31] transgression to make an end of sins to
[52:33] make reconciliation for iniquity to
[52:35] bring in everlasting righteousness to
[52:37] seal up the vision and prophecy and to
[52:39] anoint the most holy
[52:40] so inside of those seventy weeks are the
[52:43] 490 years are we okay with this 70 times
[52:47] seven is 490 years seventy weeks times
[52:51] one week equals seven years everybody
[52:54] got that 70 times seven is 490 that's
[52:59] why they asked Jesus they said are we
[53:01] supposed to forgive our brother seven
[53:04] times he said seventy times seven he was
[53:10] telling him exactly how long that they
[53:12] were gonna be in captivity and hey he
[53:15] was exactly telling them what Daniel was
[53:17] saying but they didn't catch it he said
[53:19] nope you gotta forgive seventy times
[53:21] seven you know what he was saying Bob he
[53:22] was saying I'm gonna forgive you in 70
[53:26] times seven so at the end of the 490
[53:29] years the land and the people will be
[53:31] redeemed back if I got that 70 times
[53:35] said
[53:36] in the seventy weeks of Daniel will be
[53:39] the redemption of Israel and the city
[53:43] the people and the city everybody got
[53:45] that same an alright so seventy weeks
[53:48] are determined upon thy city and upon
[53:50] the holy city to do six things all right
[53:53] six things finishes the redemption of
[53:57] Israel there buddy got that say man all
[53:59] right now let's read number three just
[54:01] to reiterate what I was saying a minute
[54:03] ago in the entombment first time we wish
[54:06] to look draw your attention to is the
[54:08] infallibility of God's Word God keeps
[54:11] his word to the letter and tonight we
[54:14] want to fast in our thoughts on that
[54:15] that God keeps his word
[54:17] we can rest assure of anything that God
[54:19] has said in his word to be the truth and
[54:22] faith does not rest upon the shifting
[54:25] sands of men's idea or man's theology
[54:28] let me read that one more time faith
[54:30] there's not rest upon the shifting sand
[54:32] of man's idea or man's theology but it
[54:35] has its final resting place on the
[54:37] unmovable rock of God's eternal word the
[54:41] word number for God hiding himself in
[54:43] simplicity and remember that's the same
[54:45] spirit from the days of Noah that says
[54:47] there's no rain we can shoot the moon
[54:49] with instruments and there's no rain but
[54:51] if God said there'd be rain there for
[54:53] faith is the substance of things hoped
[54:54] for the evidence of things not seeing if
[54:56] faith takes its final resting place on
[54:59] the Word of God there's where it finds
[55:03] its resting place so the resting place
[55:05] of you me and every other believer is on
[55:08] the Word of God and then anything that
[55:11] you think are the Prophet thinks or any
[55:16] man thinks if it's contrary to the Word
[55:18] of God it's wrong that's why brother
[55:21] Brown said you can't be you can't both
[55:23] be right one has to be right one has to
[55:25] be wrong but you cook you both can't be
[55:27] right when it's contrary to the Word of
[55:28] God
[55:29] you can't both be right in the word and
[55:31] you look in the word and you say well no
[55:33] let's not there's only three and a half
[55:35] years left of the 70 weeks of Daniel
[55:38] woolens that's not what the Bible says
[55:40] Bible says there's one week left of the
[55:43] to make the covenant from the Antichrist
[55:46] to the Jews that we're fixing to talk
[55:47] about so
[55:49] you have to make a lot of people what
[55:52] they're doing is they're trying to make
[55:53] the Bible fit the quote that's wrong in
[55:56] backwards that's what Satan did that's
[56:00] what Satan did
[56:02] Satan's quote he quoted part of what God
[56:05] said right if either quoted exactly what
[56:10] God said he'd have been right but he
[56:11] only quoted part of what God said added
[56:13] a little bit to it and he took Eve down
[56:17] and the whole human race went down so
[56:20] now in a 6-volt purpose let's read
[56:21] number five seventy weeks are determined
[56:25] upon by people for what purpose now this
[56:28] is brother Branham for what whose people
[56:30] was that determined upon Daniel's people
[56:33] the Jews so you got people Jews uh-huh
[56:40] and look upon not only Daniel but upon
[56:44] Daniels holy city Daniels holy city now
[56:48] class what was Daniel's holy city
[56:50] Jerusalem so when we look at the seventy
[56:53] weeks of Daniel it has to restore the
[56:56] people and the city inside of those
[57:01] seventy weeks because seventy weeks are
[57:03] determined to do these six things
[57:05] everybody got that say ma'am we're gonna
[57:07] take you a little bit slow so you make
[57:09] sure you understand we we flew through
[57:11] it before sometimes but maybe we need to
[57:13] kind of solidify it a little bit like
[57:18] brother Richard was in the back back
[57:20] there and he's I think I've got the
[57:22] original cassettes from nineteen seventy
[57:24] four of where daddy preached the Daniel
[57:29] seventy weeks and it ain't no different
[57:31] than what I'm telling you now what do
[57:34] you think I got to study from yeah I
[57:37] stole his sermon but God gives you a
[57:40] revelation where you can put things
[57:41] together but but like I said this is not
[57:43] a new revelation this has been since
[57:45] back then so so it's okay but we're
[57:48] gonna keep going until everybody gets it
[57:50] amen cuz brother Brown said if there's a
[57:55] question in people's mind there's a
[57:57] Bible answer for that question
[57:58] alright that's why we're putting a lot
[58:00] of that's why a lot of these are script
[58:03] sure's that we're gonna read today all
[58:05] right now let's look at number six well
[58:08] it talks about the redemption redemption
[58:10] of Jews and the city keep that in your
[58:11] mind if you keep those two things in
[58:13] your mind you'll understand this six
[58:15] fold purpose and you'll understand that
[58:16] there's not three and a half years left
[58:18] after the rapture of the whole of Daniel
[58:21] 70 last week 70th week because the Bible
[58:25] said there's not a man according to the
[58:29] Bible anybody questions you on that say
[58:31] read Daniel 9 let's see what it says and
[58:36] then if they give you another quote said
[58:37] let's read Daniel 9 don't don't get off
[58:40] for that because the Bible is not going
[58:41] to change 6 full purpose number 6 now I
[58:46] want to know friends that strike that
[58:48] striking on these things I'm certainly
[58:50] leaving out weeks of teaching but just
[58:52] kind of hitting it so where the weather
[58:53] cools off for a little bit we can get
[58:54] into the seventh seal seven by seven
[58:56] trumpets all these things I can refer
[58:58] back and say do you remember on the
[59:00] seventy weeks of Daniel now he does that
[59:03] many times in the seals and I'm back
[59:04] with you one more time again I want
[59:07] somebody to produce a quote where
[59:09] brother Branham says I was wrong then
[59:11] and I'm correcting it now now there's
[59:16] several times in the seals we just went
[59:18] through them and I read you the quotes
[59:19] where brother Brown said this was all
[59:20] the way away from my from my thought he
[59:23] talked to 104 he talked to this field
[59:25] you was the Saints under the altar well
[59:27] God had to correct him on that he taught
[59:29] the first seal he thought that was the
[59:31] white horse rider it was the Antichrist
[59:32] Godhead but you know what he came out
[59:34] and told us that what a man that come
[59:37] out and say I was wrong all that time
[59:40] when God corrected me on this when I
[59:42] show me one time he said he corrected me
[59:44] on Daniel 70 weeks he did not because he
[59:47] didn't correct you can't correct the
[59:48] word you just cannot correct the word so
[59:55] he says do you remember on the seventy
[59:57] weeks of Daniel do remember the church
[59:58] age when it went up and what taken place
[1:00:00] and the seventy weeks of Daniel covers
[1:00:02] from the going up of the church until
[1:00:04] the coming back of the church
[1:00:07] that space is one it covers not all
[1:00:09] seventy of weeks of Daniel part of it
[1:00:11] what he's saying is that part that we
[1:00:13] just said we got to go back to 606 and
[1:00:15] bring your dates and all the time
[1:00:16] when Christ was cut off and the Jew and
[1:00:18] the Gentiles were engrafted in that's
[1:00:20] the whole part of that chart but but
[1:00:23] that's all the 70 weeks there is for the
[1:00:27] redemption of Israel and the city is
[1:00:29] that one last week that's what you'll
[1:00:31] say right here all right look let's keep
[1:00:35] reading because remember from
[1:00:37] revelations for one look at me from
[1:00:39] revelations for one to 1921 we're gone
[1:00:42] we're not on earth for one there's a
[1:00:46] door open in heaven and we go up in it
[1:00:49] that's the rapture and we don't come
[1:00:51] back to revelations 19 you said well why
[1:00:53] is it in there this is what this is we
[1:00:55] get the spiritual part we get two
[1:00:57] allegories we get the the types and the
[1:01:00] shadows of the different things that's
[1:01:01] going on because remember you say well
[1:01:03] why did you preach for a year and a half
[1:01:05] on the seals if we're not even going to
[1:01:06] be here you got a spiritual part you got
[1:01:08] to get because it's a plan of redemption
[1:01:11] how you gonna throw out part of the plan
[1:01:14] of redemption you cannot throw out
[1:01:16] everything's got a we're redeemed
[1:01:18] Israel's redeemed the earth is redeemed
[1:01:21] remember everything fell in the Garden
[1:01:24] of Eden there was nothing nothing made
[1:01:27] it unscathed
[1:01:29] everything fell from Adam all the way
[1:01:32] down to Jesus Christ and he was even
[1:01:34] living in a falling body and it had to
[1:01:37] be redeemed it had to be made eternal
[1:01:39] but he gave his soul ransom that was
[1:01:43] eternal baby
[1:01:45] thank God in the 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:01:53] covers from the going up of the church
[1:01:54] until the coming back of the church this
[1:01:57] afternoon we'll get into that cuz this
[1:01:58] is taken up into a North the most holy
[1:02:00] he gets real clear on that seventy weeks
[1:02:02] are determined now there was a sixth
[1:02:04] full purpose of his visit telling him
[1:02:06] what was going to come to pass now there
[1:02:08] was a six full purpose of his coming now
[1:02:12] tonight I think we'll leave off over
[1:02:13] here in the scriptures where he was at
[1:02:14] this morning where's the sixth full
[1:02:16] purpose he's not gonna read it again in
[1:02:17] other words let's go down to the next
[1:02:19] paragraph and 70 of weeks and seventy
[1:02:22] weeks are determined upon by people now
[1:02:24] remember that is all the journey of the
[1:02:26] Israelites will have on this earth they
[1:02:28] are determined seventy weeks what for
[1:02:30] 90 years right 70 weeks is just
[1:02:34] determined that's always lauded to the
[1:02:36] Jews upon thy people and upon the holy

[1:03:30] start into it just a minute but I want
[1:03:31] you to see this part how is this gonna
[1:03:33] happen some somebody shows up when we
[1:03:40] leave there's two prophets show up
[1:03:42] they're not preaching now cause God's
[1:03:47] not dealing with the Gentiles and the
[1:03:48] Jews at the same time he's dealing with
[1:03:51] us it's what I said before I it's not I
[1:03:54] don't say it's a waste of time to go to
[1:03:55] Israel but that's not our part that's
[1:03:59] not for us why don't we get ourselves
[1:04:01] ready to get out of here get ourselves
[1:04:04] ready to get out of here then God can go
[1:04:06] to the Jews he's already promised that
[1:04:08] I'm reading it right here revelations 11
[1:04:10] verse 1 and that was given to me a reed
[1:04:12] and like them to a rod and the angel
[1:04:14] students that arrives and measured the
[1:04:16] temple of God and the altar and them
[1:04:18] that worship therein so guess what's
[1:04:21] going to happen they're gonna build that
[1:04:23] temple they're gonna put it back
[1:04:25] together as soon as we leave that's why
[1:04:27] the Pope's gonna go over there and say
[1:04:29] hey let's make a covenant and the
[1:04:31] Israel's gonna go well you've got our
[1:04:33] stuff you've got our menorah and you've
[1:04:37] got our Holy of Holies you've got our
[1:04:38] lavish you you get down there in the
[1:04:40] basement in the Vatican somewhere so
[1:04:43] Pope is gonna say
[1:04:44] okay let's make a covenant you know what
[1:04:46] he's got in his mind he's gonna take
[1:04:48] over so he gives them all that stuff
[1:04:50] back they put the temple back together I
[1:04:53] just read you that quote back over here
[1:04:55] a little bit it says Jerusalem will be
[1:04:57] rebuilt again the daily sacrifice will
[1:04:59] be set up and the Antichrist will make a
[1:05:01] covenant for them last seven weeks or
[1:05:03] seven years and in the midst he'll break
[1:05:05] the Covenant they're gonna get
[1:05:07] everything back together we'll talk
[1:05:10] about that in a little while but let's
[1:05:13] go to revelations a level one verse two
[1:05:16] but the court which is without the
[1:05:17] temple leave out and measure it not for
[1:05:19] it is given unto the Gentiles and the
[1:05:21] Holy City shall they tread under foot
[1:05:23] forty and two months now watch forty-two
[1:05:26] months three and a half years and I will
[1:05:31] give power unto my two witnesses we know
[1:05:33] to the prophet of God that is the spirit
[1:05:35] of Moses and the spirit of Elijah on to
[1:05:38] Jews nothing to do with the Gentiles
[1:05:42] listen folks even now we're dogs to them
[1:05:46] we're not even they hate us being even
[1:05:48] over there they treated that in them
[1:05:52] pretty bad you know while they were over
[1:05:53] there and that was back in the 90s think
[1:05:56] about now because you know it's
[1:05:58] two-spirit though that's them Jews it's
[1:06:00] not Christian Jews they're just used hey
[1:06:03] we're Jews and I will give power to my
[1:06:07] two witnesses and they shall prophesy
[1:06:08] one thousand two hundred and threescore
[1:06:12] days which is what twelve hundred and
[1:06:15] sixty days and if you don't mind
[1:06:17] somebody was asking me a question the
[1:06:19] other day I've got 1260 days that's that
[1:06:21] prophecy that we just talked about
[1:06:22] revelations 11 but there is 1260 days on
[1:06:25] this side to do you can drop that in
[1:06:27] there what oh I'm sorry you can drop
[1:06:32] that in there sorry John that's my boy
[1:06:39] so you can going right 1260 days up here
[1:06:42] because it's 1260 three and a half years
[1:06:44] and three and a half years of 360 days
[1:06:48] to a year not not 365 and the fourth
[1:06:53] everybody got that saying man all right
[1:06:55] so it's 1260 if you're riding on you
[1:06:57] chart 12c
[1:06:58] in 1260 all right everybody got that all
[1:07:01] right the two witnesses are going to do
[1:07:05] what they're going to do three things
[1:07:06] just like God come to us on the day of
[1:07:10] Pentecost that brother Dale has been
[1:07:12] preaching for months now what's he gonna
[1:07:13] do pull it up pull it back up to where I
[1:07:16] got the three that's exactly what
[1:07:19] they're gonna do to the Jews they're
[1:07:23] going to preach justification they're
[1:07:24] gonna preach sanctification they're
[1:07:26] gonna preach the baptism of the holy
[1:07:27] ghost they're gonna receive not the
[1:07:29] message of the hour us know they're
[1:07:33] gonna receive their message now sure
[1:07:35] they're gonna hear from that brother
[1:07:37] branham was here and there they're
[1:07:39] probably quoting but they're not gonna
[1:07:40] go over there like I said I'm sorry
[1:07:41] they're gonna go over and just play
[1:07:42] tapes there's two human people gonna go
[1:07:46] over there and they're going to preach
[1:07:48] and fire is gonna proceed from their
[1:07:49] mouth and whatever they say that's
[1:07:51] what's gonna happen you know what
[1:07:53] they're untouchable for 1260 days
[1:07:56] nothing can kill them don't you think
[1:07:58] I've said before the Mossad
[1:08:00] the FBI the CIA the KGB the BFI and
[1:08:05] whatever you want to call them they're
[1:08:06] all gonna be won't to kill them two guys
[1:08:08] right cuz all they're going to extend
[1:08:11] and go I'll open up the ground and you
[1:08:15] know big troop coming at you they go
[1:08:16] open up the ground like Moses did same
[1:08:18] thing suck up a thousand men at a time
[1:08:24] they're not gonna they're going to be
[1:08:25] untouchable for 1260 days don't you
[1:08:28] think this whole world is going to be
[1:08:30] mad at them amen cuz they have power to
[1:08:34] do all the shut up to heaven don't rain
[1:08:36] for three and a half years you think
[1:08:40] we're having a problem out here now
[1:08:41] think about three and a half years of
[1:08:42] that and the Bible says even in the
[1:08:43] largest time do didn't even fall on the
[1:08:45] ground
[1:08:46] they wouldn't even do on the ground for
[1:08:48] three and a half years so they're going
[1:08:50] to preach justification sanctification
[1:08:52] to baptism the Holy Ghost and we're
[1:08:54] going to show too that if you look at
[1:08:55] your chart
[1:08:56] we're going to show that they what in
[1:08:58] through their message they finish the
[1:09:00] transgression of Israel they make an
[1:09:02] event of sins of Israel and they reckons
[1:09:04] they make reconciliation for iniquity so
[1:09:07] they finish an end and reconcile and now
[1:09:09] what God did to you
[1:09:11] he puts you through justification
[1:09:13] chopped off your past sins got rid of
[1:09:15] what your old you your old you sins he
[1:09:21] in your hello you he got really over you
[1:09:22] since the oh you still there the ol you
[1:09:25] don't dial right here but you take
[1:09:27] sanctification what's that cleaned and
[1:09:29] set aside for service then the Holy
[1:09:32] Ghost is going to come in and fill them
[1:09:34] some hoard during that 1260 days 144,000
[1:09:40] twelve thousand out of each tribe of
[1:09:42] Israel is going to receive the baptism
[1:09:43] of the Holy Ghost and they're going to
[1:09:46] go in the rapture if they're going to be
[1:09:47] killed along with the two witnesses all
[1:09:49] right so let's go real quick finish the
[1:09:52] transgression all right everybody got
[1:09:55] that this is the what transgression
[1:10:00] means in the Bible in other words look
[1:10:04] at yourself in your justification put
[1:10:09] this also under the first seal where the
[1:10:11] white horse rider you look at
[1:10:12] justification what is that as recognized
[1:10:14] by center as God forgives what did he do
[1:10:17] what did God forgive he forgave your
[1:10:19] past sins enough for you to realize you
[1:10:23] were lost and then you moved into
[1:10:26] sanctification he gives you a new heart
[1:10:28] he gives you a new spirit not the Holy
[1:10:31] Spirit he gives you a new heart and a
[1:10:33] new spirit you move into sanctification
[1:10:34] well that's what's going to happen to
[1:10:36] the children of Israel during this time
[1:10:39] the Jews are going to be preached and
[1:10:41] they're gonna realize they transgressed
[1:10:44] they're going to realize they sinned but
[1:10:47] look I love what it says finish god
[1:10:52] finish your transgression when he
[1:10:54] justifies you now look at number seven
[1:11:01] six full purpose now if we go back into
[1:11:05] Daniel again we'll find out that in
[1:11:06] Daniel we find out the twenty fourth
[1:11:08] verse to finish the transgression to
[1:11:09] finish what to finish Israel's
[1:11:13] transgression now look this is not to
[1:11:15] the world
[1:11:16] there's not one Gentile going to be
[1:11:19] saved after the rapture after we leave
[1:11:20] so this is the only brother right to the
[1:11:23] 144,000 is
[1:11:25] not gonna be 144 thousand and ten but
[1:11:28] you understand what I mean I mean
[1:11:29] there's gonna be women and children
[1:11:30] there too but at 144 thousand heads of
[1:11:32] the household are going to be saved so
[1:11:35] let's be technical about it ok to finish
[1:11:37] Israel's transgression what is the
[1:11:39] transgress it's to go against something
[1:11:42] a transgress against me is to do a wrong
[1:11:45] to me what did we do our transgression
[1:11:47] was I live 20 years a transgressor I did
[1:11:55] wrong to God but accepted it is same in
[1:12:00] 12 years old or whatever the age of
[1:12:02] accountability is but I didn't do that
[1:12:04] you didn't do that so you transgressed
[1:12:09] against turns dressed against you as to
[1:12:11] do it wrong to you so Israel didn't
[1:12:14] wrong to God and in this 70th week now
[1:12:18] did he say half he said in this 70th
[1:12:22] week what's going to happen God is going
[1:12:26] to finish the transgression of Israel
[1:12:31] finish the transgression we'll be
[1:12:34] turning away the ungodliness from Jacob
[1:12:36] and then all Israel will be born again
[1:12:39] all of them will receive the Holy Ghost
[1:12:42] that buddy Scott has finished a
[1:12:44] transgression you got to start somewhere
[1:12:46] he's gonna finish the transgression cuz
[1:12:48] remember those who is justified he's
[1:12:49] already glorified all right same way
[1:12:52] with you you and I that's why the type
[1:12:54] is to me and you this 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:12:59] is a type to me and you of how we get to
[1:13:01] our Redemption but what happens to
[1:13:03] Israel they get a definite space of time
[1:13:05] and you got to put the land in our land
[1:13:08] is what you're sitting in today this is
[1:13:11] the land of the Gentiles that God won't
[1:13:13] still inhabit he'd sure he loves that
[1:13:15] City over there but he had rather
[1:13:17] inhabit you then it habit a house but he
[1:13:21] had to spark that way with Israel he had
[1:13:24] to give them Moses had to go and get a
[1:13:26] tabernacle put it up the Holy of Holies
[1:13:28] the priest would go in one time he would
[1:13:31] make an atonement for all of Israel
[1:13:33] that's how it had to begin but remember
[1:13:35] Christ came and made an atonement once
[1:13:37] for all
[1:13:39] took care of every bit of that so we
[1:13:40] don't have to build a building he built
[1:13:44] the building right here
[1:13:45] Hebrews 10 5 a body thou has prepared me
[1:13:51] so God can Tabernacle in it
[1:13:54] that's what brother Dale was preaching
[1:13:56] on the statue a perfect man he comes in
[1:13:59] and habits but you got to remember
[1:14:01] there's doors and doors and doors in
[1:14:03] doors you know so Israel did it wrong to
[1:14:06] God he will turn the ungodliness from
[1:14:08] Jacob then all Israel will be born again
[1:14:10] now you say oh he said all Israel
[1:14:12] hundred and forty-four thousand go back
[1:14:15] to the Bible all right
[1:14:17] all of them will receive the Holy Ghost
[1:14:19] that's true 144,000 will receive the
[1:14:22] Holy Ghost Romans 11 verse 21 let's look
[1:14:25] and see what the Bible says about the
[1:14:26] ungodliness of Jacob for if God spared
[1:14:28] not of the natural branches took heed
[1:14:31] lest he also spare not they behold
[1:14:33] therefore the goodness and severity of
[1:14:35] God on them which fell severity but
[1:14:38] toward thee goodness if thou continue in
[1:14:40] his goodness otherwise that also shall
[1:14:43] be cut off he's talking to the Gentiles
[1:14:46] we were grafted in we were the wild
[1:14:49] olive branch and I know you didn't can't
[1:14:53] see it but I'm gonna reach right here
[1:14:55] and get this I'd hand these out but you
[1:15:01] look at this and what look at me you see
[1:15:06] that part right there that's the
[1:15:09] engrafting of the Gentiles that's what
[1:15:11] Paul's talking about we this is Israel
[1:15:14] as always the olive tree right if there
[1:15:17] had not been a Gentile bride this is
[1:15:19] what would have happened that would have
[1:15:23] been 490 running years complete 490
[1:15:26] running years Israel would have been
[1:15:27] redeemed and they would have had a
[1:15:29] future home to go to but remember God
[1:15:32] had in his mind a Gentile bride so we
[1:15:36] had to be grafted in this tree but now
[1:15:39] remember these branches were cut off at
[1:15:44] Calvary Jews the Jews got cut off
[1:15:51] after 62 weeks Messiah will be cut off
[1:15:54] who cut him off who killed him the Jews
[1:15:57] kill sure you say well we killed him and
[1:15:58] no literally the Jew said let his blood
[1:16:00] be on us we'll get to in just a second
[1:16:01] but this is in grafting Paul's talking
[1:16:04] about but watch what he says and they
[1:16:07] also if they abide not still and
[1:16:10] unbelief shall be graffed it in for God
[1:16:12] is able to graft them in again he's got
[1:16:17] to finish that week he's got to finish
[1:16:20] that last part cuz they turned him down
[1:16:22] right here at Calvary they turned him
[1:16:25] down cut him off but he's gonna graft
[1:16:29] them back in that's what he says her
[1:16:30] hair shall be grafted in for God is able
[1:16:34] to graft them in again for if thou wert
[1:16:37] cut out of the olive tree which is wild
[1:16:39] by nature and we're grafted contrary to
[1:16:42] nature into a good olive tree that was
[1:16:44] us into a good olive tree how much more
[1:16:48] shall these which be the natural branch
[1:16:50] be grafted into their own tree because
[1:16:56] the tree is Jewish we were just grafted
[1:16:59] in the wild olive branch was just
[1:17:01] grafted in to live off the life amen
[1:17:09] but I would not brethren this you should
[1:17:11] be ignorant of this mystery lest you
[1:17:13] should be wise in your own conceits that
[1:17:15] blindness in part has happened to Israel
[1:17:17] until the fullness of the Gentiles be
[1:17:19] come in so God blinded his children we
[1:17:22] know on the fifth seal we were talking
[1:17:23] about that God blinded their whole of
[1:17:26] Israel's eyes he is not dealing with
[1:17:29] them during this whole time but he's
[1:17:32] going to graft them back in when we
[1:17:33] leave when we leave they're been blind
[1:17:38] but what's going to how that was your
[1:17:40] eyes open because remember before you
[1:17:43] were born again you were blind some
[1:17:49] person somebody preached the sermon
[1:17:51] somebody read a scripture somebody put
[1:17:53] you under conviction because of what the
[1:17:54] word said and what your eyes were open
[1:17:58] so through two prophets on that twin
[1:18:01] that 1260 days they're going to preach
[1:18:04] and sanctification the baptism of the
[1:18:05] Holy Ghost and their eyes are going to
[1:18:07] be open we read it in just a little
[1:18:10] while
[1:18:11] the blindness in part has happened to
[1:18:14] Israel until the fullness of the
[1:18:15] Gentiles be come in and so all Israel
[1:18:16] shall be saved now Paul all Israel know
[1:18:19] we realized that's 144,000 as it is
[1:18:23] written this will come out of Zion the
[1:18:25] deliverer and shall turn away
[1:18:26] ungodliness from Jacob for this is my
[1:18:29] covenant unto them when I shall take
[1:18:33] away their sins house their sins gonna
[1:18:37] be taken away to prophet 6 full purpose
[1:18:39] all right there buddy got that say man
[1:18:41] all right just for a minute here make an
[1:18:44] end of sin number to remember finish it
[1:18:48] when God justifies you he never
[1:18:51] remembers what you did from that point
[1:18:53] back hey men God's got to forget what
[1:18:58] Israel did to him you say that was
[1:19:01] horrible what you did to him was worse
[1:19:07] so let's don't crow like brother Branham
[1:19:10] says let's don't grow too much you said
[1:19:13] all them poor Liz realized they were
[1:19:14] blinded well so were you until God
[1:19:17] opened your eyes you were blinded and
[1:19:20] you know until you had an end of sin
[1:19:23] watch what this is going on watch how
[1:19:24] this I saw this the other day and it
[1:19:27] really touched my heart so let's see if
[1:19:29] it'll touch yours because remember where
[1:19:33] did they do their bottle number to make
[1:19:34] an end of sins now let's read again
[1:19:37] Daniel to finish transgression and make
[1:19:38] an end of sins now when God makes an end
[1:19:41] of something it's over the man when God
[1:19:45] makes an end of sin end of sins it's
[1:19:47] over now let's read Daniel 9 that's his
[1:19:50] second purpose of coming first to finish
[1:19:53] Israel's transgression and make an end
[1:19:55] of sin where did Israel sin where did
[1:19:58] they do their vile sin where did they
[1:20:00] separate himself from God now he goes to
[1:20:03] Mathew mm-hmm he looks says 24 but it's
[1:20:08] 27 we know that so he says here Matthew
[1:20:10] 27 the Gospel of Matthew so let's go to
[1:20:13] Matthew 27 21 and let's read this but
[1:20:16] the chief priests and elders
[1:20:17] persuaded the multitude that they should
[1:20:19] ask Barabbas and destroy Jesus the
[1:20:21] governor answered and said unto them
[1:20:23] we're never the twain well then I
[1:20:25] release unto you they said now whose day
[1:20:28] it is a congregation of the chief
[1:20:32] priests and elders of Israel not
[1:20:35] Gentiles the Jews is what came to him
[1:20:40] and said here we want him crucified
[1:20:42] because what Pilate he's trying to give
[1:20:44] them back to them Pilate said unto them
[1:20:47] what shall I do with this Jesus which is
[1:20:49] called Christ
[1:20:50] they all said unto him let him be
[1:20:53] crucified and the governor said why what
[1:20:56] evil has he done but they cried out the
[1:20:58] more sane let him be crucified when
[1:21:01] Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing
[1:21:03] but that rather a tumult was made he
[1:21:05] took water and washed his hands before
[1:21:07] the multitude saying I am innocent of
[1:21:10] the blood of this just man see to it
[1:21:12] then answered all the people and said
[1:21:15] his blood be on us and our children okay
[1:21:21] on us and our children so for two
[1:21:24] thousand years that prophecy has been
[1:21:27] running it's been a running prophecy let
[1:21:30] his blood be on us and our children in
[1:21:32] other words every generation from that
[1:21:34] time forward God has cut them off or
[1:21:37] blinded them let's look at something for
[1:21:41] you just for men what is sanctification
[1:21:45] what is sanctification red blood red
[1:21:49] blood cleaned and set aside clean and
[1:21:52] set aside what the red blood the red
[1:21:54] horse-rider
[1:21:55] sanctification is what red let's watch
[1:21:59] this let's go back to number nine
[1:22:01] there's where they done it he was making
[1:22:04] the end of sin for them how could he do
[1:22:07] anything else but forgive them knowing
[1:22:09] that he had to blind their eyes that we
[1:22:12] could come in it's like his own children
[1:22:14] calling for his blood listen the very
[1:22:18] blood they were calling for it's what
[1:22:21] sanctified them they were calling their
[1:22:24] own sanctification they just didn't know
[1:22:26] that and that is horrible but that's the
[1:22:30] best thing they could have said God knew
[1:22:34] that was going to be the Gentiles come
[1:22:35] in but when they said let his blood be
[1:22:37] on us he kept them for 2,000 years sure
[1:22:44] they went through horrible things but
[1:22:45] he's going to come out of this thing in
[1:22:47] sanctification through two prophets and
[1:22:49] by the cleansing of the shed blood
[1:22:51] they're going to see that blood was shed
[1:22:54] at Calvary for them no one had to blind
[1:23:02] him so they could come in it's like his
[1:23:03] own children calling for his blood and
[1:23:05] they were blinded and he knowed they
[1:23:08] were blinded that's the reason he cried
[1:23:10] for forgiveness for them forgive them
[1:23:12] father for they don't know what they're
[1:23:14] doing they were blind for our sake they
[1:23:17] were made blind in their unbelief they
[1:23:20] did this but when they see him again
[1:23:22] amen
[1:23:24] put an end to sin what is sin unbelief
[1:23:26] they did not believe it was the Messiah
[1:23:29] they could not see him to be the Messiah
[1:23:31] yet he done ever signed the Messiah was
[1:23:33] supposed to do but they could not see it
[1:23:35] they were blind now let's go to
[1:23:37] Zechariah 13 let's read a few scriptures
[1:23:39] right here Zechariah 13:1 says in that
[1:23:42] day there should be a fountain open to
[1:23:44] the house of David and to the
[1:23:45] inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and
[1:23:49] uncleanness Zechariah 13 let's continue
[1:23:52] read verse 6 though let's skip it down a
[1:23:55] little bit there you go and one shall
[1:23:56] say unto Him what are these wounds in
[1:23:59] that hand then he shall answer those
[1:24:02] with which I was wounded in the house of
[1:24:05] my friends awake o sword against my
[1:24:07] shepherd and against the man that is my
[1:24:09] fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the
[1:24:11] Shepherd and the Sheep shall be
[1:24:12] scattered now we remember I didn't get
[1:24:15] this in here because I thought it
[1:24:16] wouldn't have time but let me just
[1:24:18] interject right here brother Branham
[1:24:19] said Jesus quoted this very scripture
[1:24:22] but he stopped right here just like he
[1:24:27] said today this scripture is fulfilled
[1:24:28] in your ears and he was talking about
[1:24:30] you know and brother Graham said Jesus
[1:24:32] stopped because the rest of it will be
[1:24:34] full delightful field later well see he
[1:24:36] couldn't say the rest of it he couldn't
[1:24:39] turn his hand
[1:24:40] to the little ones which is the Benjamin
[1:24:42] group 144,000 he turned it to us and
[1:24:46] then now we read and I will turn my hand
[1:24:50] upon the little ones Jesus couldn't say
[1:24:51] that because he went what they already
[1:24:53] rejected him he was headed toward the
[1:24:55] Gentiles but he knew that when all this
[1:24:59] was over where the Gentiles had left
[1:25:01] that he's going to turn back to the
[1:25:03] little ones the little Benjamin group
[1:25:05] amen that all rights a man all right
[1:25:09] look let's go to number 10
[1:25:10] they'll be show so ashamed of their self
[1:25:13] when they stand there and see that very
[1:25:15] one that they crucified in the night
[1:25:17] standing there their own precious Joseph
[1:25:20] they'll be such morning they'll say
[1:25:21] where did you get those scars he said in
[1:25:24] the house of my friends see what I mean
[1:25:26] to make an end of sin of unbelief that's
[1:25:29] what he's coming for in this 7870 of
[1:25:32] year of Daniel made corrects itself 70th
[1:25:34] week 70th we not halfway 70th week
[1:25:38] rather coming to make an end of sin put
[1:25:41] it away you understand now what's the
[1:25:43] first to finish the transgression to
[1:25:44] make an end of sin now number three is
[1:25:47] going to be making reconciliation we'll
[1:25:49] get to that in about would give me about
[1:25:51] five more minutes
[1:25:52] but sanctification let's pull up the
[1:25:54] nation this is what I was talking about
[1:25:55] sanctification red blood they said let
[1:25:59] his blood be on us they were calling
[1:26:01] their own sanctification but now
[1:26:03] remember God had to cut them off because
[1:26:05] they didn't believe he was doing it
[1:26:06] remember brother Graham told us he said
[1:26:08] Christ died at Calvary for all of us
[1:26:11] justified us sanctified us right we just
[1:26:16] remember it was applied to us during the
[1:26:19] church ages but it was not applied to
[1:26:21] the Jews until we leave then it becomes
[1:26:23] applied to them he did not listen the
[1:26:27] day of atonement Christ don't have to
[1:26:28] get back on the cross you don't have to
[1:26:30] kill the major sacrifice he's already
[1:26:32] been killed at Calvary they're going to
[1:26:34] look and say where did you get those
[1:26:36] wounds and and this says well in the
[1:26:38] house and my friends but you know what
[1:26:39] the two prophets are going to do they're
[1:26:40] going to turn them right back to that
[1:26:42] very statement and they you're gonna say
[1:26:44] you put it on yourself you said let his
[1:26:48] blood be on us and thank God you did
[1:26:51] because
[1:26:51] covered you for 2,000 years and now your
[1:26:55] eyes are going to be open Jenny wait
[1:26:58] with us if you'll follow a lesson if
[1:27:01] you're born again you when we hit these
[1:27:03] these things of justification you'll say
[1:27:06] that's exactly what happened to me may
[1:27:09] not be exact same statement I make or
[1:27:12] brother Dale makes but when I became
[1:27:14] sanctified I knew somebody was cleaning
[1:27:16] me up and it was not me so they're going
[1:27:20] to come to a place to where they're
[1:27:22] going to say through those two prophets
[1:27:24] they're going to see Christ now
[1:27:29] physically you're not going to see him
[1:27:31] physically you're seeing them through a
[1:27:34] fivefold ministry and through your life
[1:27:36] that lives it back out let his blood the
[1:27:40] Red Horse let his blood be on us whoa
[1:27:44] hey let his blood be on me keep me
[1:27:47] sanctified keep me to a place to where
[1:27:50] what there's your daily sanctification
[1:27:53] just keep what keep going keep going
[1:27:55] keep going
[1:27:57] brother branham even says he said all
[1:27:59] they're trying to do away with the blood
[1:28:01] listen you do away with the blood you've
[1:28:03] took yourself out from under any type of
[1:28:05] keeping you clean I want to stay under
[1:28:09] there and just let it completely just
[1:28:10] run all over me so did they but when you
[1:28:15] know we looked at that you say well
[1:28:16] that's the most hideous thing they did
[1:28:18] that's all they could do to be to be
[1:28:22] where they can be sanctified when we
[1:28:24] leave where they can look back and the
[1:28:27] two prophets go there is where it
[1:28:29] happened Calvary is where this man
[1:28:32] called Jesus sanctified you could look
[1:28:34] just where did you get two wounds he had
[1:28:37] already been crucified the wounds what
[1:28:39] he was at Calvary he got wounded
[1:28:42] remember he was wounded for your
[1:28:43] transgressions bruised for your
[1:28:46] iniquities say with them all right let's
[1:28:48] go to acts 2:38 and Peter said unto them
[1:28:50] repent because we got one more level to
[1:28:53] go to right we got one more repent and
[1:28:57] be baptized everyone your name of Jesus
[1:28:58] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:29:01] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:03] for the promise isn't to you
[1:29:05] who was he talking to Jews
[1:29:10] because remember the first the first
[1:29:13] bunch that got the baptism as Holy Ghost
[1:29:15] were Jews they fell on the Jews first
[1:29:18] the Bible says then on the Gentiles so
[1:29:20] there was an overlap you're going to see
[1:29:22] overlaps everything has an overlap
[1:29:24] alright there's an overlap of the
[1:29:26] Gentiles coming in there was 120 in the
[1:29:29] upper room they were all Jews but there
[1:29:31] was three thousand downstairs it was of
[1:29:33] many nations but remember they were the
[1:29:36] spokesperson so it was a Jewish first
[1:29:38] run in other words of the baptism of
[1:29:40] Holy Ghost but there was a time in there
[1:29:42] where Paul says look we're closing the
[1:29:45] door
[1:29:45] God's closing the door on you because
[1:29:49] I've come to you and you've rejected me
[1:29:50] what to the Jews he said lo I turn to
[1:29:53] the Gentile will see that opened up that
[1:29:55] time of the Gentiles where you and I
[1:29:57] could come in right but there is an
[1:30:00] overlap in there for the promise isn't
[1:30:02] to you and to your children and to them
[1:30:05] that are far off even as many as the
[1:30:07] Lord our God shall call us do this real
[1:30:10] quick to make reconciliation for
[1:30:12] iniquity that's number three look on
[1:30:14] your chart you got you got to reconcile
[1:30:17] the people it's going to take 1 2 3
[1:30:20] finish the transgression make an end of
[1:30:22] sin and reconciliation for iniquity
[1:30:24] listen God talks about reconciling
[1:30:26] what's what's reconciling that means
[1:30:29] you've been apart for a while he can't
[1:30:32] talk to you sure he can talk to you a
[1:30:34] little bit but he really wants when he
[1:30:35] gives you the baptism to my Holy Ghost
[1:30:37] he is intimately communing with you
[1:30:40] hallelujah
[1:30:42] intimately communing with you and that's
[1:30:44] what he wants to do those 144,000 to
[1:30:48] make reconciliation for iniquity real
[1:30:50] quick what is that to cover to purge
[1:30:53] make an atonement make reconciliation
[1:30:56] cover over with pitch to cover over
[1:31:00] atone for sin make an atonement now when
[1:31:03] the priest went in to make the atonement
[1:31:06] he didn't have to go back the next day
[1:31:08] they were covered for a whole year
[1:31:10] according to what God had told him right
[1:31:13] but now God Christ went into the Holy of
[1:31:16] Holies one time and he's covered us for
[1:31:18] an eternity
[1:31:19] all right so they don't have to go back
[1:31:21] to sacrifices that's what's gonna kill
[1:31:23] them 144,000 they're gonna be killed by
[1:31:26] their own people when they walk into the
[1:31:28] temple and say that's not it right this
[1:31:33] the sacrificing of goats and animals and
[1:31:36] all them ones though those fonts Jews
[1:31:38] have been trying for 2,000 years to get
[1:31:40] that back together and all of a sudden
[1:31:42] they get it all back together and as a
[1:31:43] group walks in and goes god I ain't even
[1:31:46] in this God's in this now he's not even
[1:31:51] in that building he's in this now Lord
[1:31:53] they're gonna kill him 144,000 just like
[1:31:56] they'll kill us even not maybe not
[1:31:58] physically but they can kill you
[1:32:01] influence to cover over atone for sins
[1:32:04] to make an atonement so what's it gonna
[1:32:07] do when he gives you the baptism the
[1:32:08] Holy Ghost you receive the atonement the
[1:32:11] man right you receive the atonement
[1:32:12] Christ doesn't have to get back on the
[1:32:14] cross he's already covered you you just
[1:32:17] gotta accept it number 11 let's do this
[1:32:18] real quick six full purpose to make
[1:32:20] reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is
[1:32:22] doing wrong as they did at the cross he
[1:32:25] made reconciliations but it will not be
[1:32:28] applied to them why it wasn't applied
[1:32:31] back then he did it remember he don't
[1:32:34] have to go get back up on Calvary when
[1:32:36] the two witnesses hit the earth they're
[1:32:38] going to point them back to the true
[1:32:40] atonement that happened 2,000 years ago
[1:32:43] and said that's where you did your own
[1:32:46] it was not applied to them why because
[1:32:49] they were blinded and could not see it
[1:32:51] and the Prophet says we why did they
[1:32:54] blend you said well maybe today because
[1:32:56] I'm blind
[1:32:56] you're willfully blind they were blinded
[1:32:59] because God blinded them see if God
[1:33:01] blinds you that's why he's got to give
[1:33:02] that fifth seal Jew eternal life because
[1:33:05] he's the one that blinded him man didn't
[1:33:08] blind them God Himself blinded those
[1:33:10] Jews so that you and I could come in so
[1:33:13] he has to give them eternal life cuz he
[1:33:15] said just guard sorry brother Larry put
[1:33:18] your hearing aid him I'm about done well
[1:33:23] maybe today because I'm blind you're
[1:33:25] willfully blind they were blind because
[1:33:27] God blinded them but you're blind
[1:33:29] because you're willfully blind
[1:33:30] there's no reconciliation for you
[1:33:32] if you believe not I am he Jesus said
[1:33:35] you'll die in your sin he talks back to
[1:33:38] talks about in the days of Zechariah
[1:33:41] listen let's skip on down number twelve
[1:33:45] six-fold purpose now Jesus quoted that
[1:33:46] scripture here it is I didn't put it I
[1:33:49] did put it in here smite the Shepherd
[1:33:50] and scared of the Sheep but notice the
[1:33:51] next paragraph he just quoted that much
[1:33:54] of it but watch what the next sentence
[1:33:56] of it says and that's part of it I will
[1:33:58] turn my hand to the little ones what the
[1:34:00] Benjamin group that's coming up now I
[1:34:02] will turn my hand to the little ones see
[1:34:06] we can we can almost say it today that
[1:34:08] scriptures fulfilled because they're
[1:34:11] hidden he's headed toward them we're
[1:34:13] about over here we're about done there's
[1:34:16] no more Church agents no more prophets
[1:34:17] to come it's just getting ready to get
[1:34:19] out of here and then boom he's going
[1:34:21] right over there to them alright he just
[1:34:25] quoted that I'll turn it to the Benzema
[1:34:26] group that's coming up now turn my hands
[1:34:28] to the little ones smite the Shepherd
[1:34:29] Israel first Israel smote the shepherd
[1:34:32] Israel smoke Christ smoke the Shepherd
[1:34:35] back 2,000 years ago scattered the Sheep
[1:34:38] to all the world remember the promise
[1:34:41] was is you're going to be scattered
[1:34:43] dispersed all over the world and then
[1:34:46] what's going to happen you're going to
[1:34:47] come back we already read them but God
[1:34:50] said I will turn my hand back to get
[1:34:52] them little ones at the last day when
[1:34:54] when reconciliation for iniquity has
[1:34:56] been made Israel will be saved every one
[1:35:00] of them let's turn to Isaiah he says
[1:35:02] Isaiah 66 chapter and read just for a
[1:35:05] minute and see what God says about
[1:35:06] Israel being saved how long it will take
[1:35:08] to save Israel what's real quick as I in
[1:35:11] Isaiah 66 8 verse if you want to read it
[1:35:14] who has heard such a thing who has seen
[1:35:17] such a thing shall the earth be made to
[1:35:19] bring forth in one day for as soon as
[1:35:21] i'm travaileth she brought forth her
[1:35:23] children as soon as i saw that that was
[1:35:26] their Messiah she was born again in one
[1:35:27] day make reconciliation for sins to make
[1:35:30] reconciliation for iniquity you see what
[1:35:32] I mean this is what brother Dale is
[1:35:34] talking about you can be Saint justified
[1:35:36] and sanctified these people can be
[1:35:38] justified and sanctified for twelve
[1:35:40] hundred and fifty nine days but one day
[1:35:45] they're gonna be safe I'm just reading
[1:35:48] the Bible right but you got to go
[1:35:50] through the process same way with all of
[1:35:54] us you gotta go through a process as
[1:35:57] soon as I saw that her massage that that
[1:35:59] was her massage she was born again in
[1:36:01] one day make reconciliation for sin to
[1:36:03] make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:36:05] uncleanness no mind they did that what
[1:36:07] was evil that which was wrong
[1:36:08] reconciliation was made for their
[1:36:10] iniquity now let's go to 2nd Corinthians
[1:36:12] 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in
[1:36:15] Christ is a new creature now they're
[1:36:17] going to be totally a new creature
[1:36:19] because they're over there right now
[1:36:21] listen they're over there right now and
[1:36:23] they still don't believe that Christ was
[1:36:26] a messiah but they're going to be turned
[1:36:29] just like you didn't you you tell you
[1:36:32] out what that wasn't Jesus and there
[1:36:33] wasn't it no he did become personal -
[1:36:35] you got the new birth he's not gonna
[1:36:38] become personally balem until they
[1:36:39] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost a
[1:36:40] man therefore if any man be in Christ is
[1:36:43] a new creature old things are passed
[1:36:44] away behold all things have become new
[1:36:47] and all things are of God who has
[1:36:49] reconciled us now what we're taking on
[1:36:51] the reconciliation for iniquity all
[1:36:55] right reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:36:57] Christ and has given to us the Ministry
[1:37:01] of reconciliation as I said before
[1:37:05] through a minister you got convicted our
[1:37:08] reading scripture listening to a tape
[1:37:10] listening to somebody on you didn't just
[1:37:13] sit there one day and go I'm lost no
[1:37:17] there had to be a conviction you cannot
[1:37:19] tell me you just were walked out of the
[1:37:21] wilderness and said I'm lost no there
[1:37:23] was a conviction somewhere that that God
[1:37:27] said I am separated from you I have been
[1:37:30] separated from you for a long time now I
[1:37:32] want to reconcile you back to fellowship
[1:37:36] because what's what he says to win that
[1:37:38] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:37:41] unto himself not imputing their
[1:37:44] trespasses unto them and have committed
[1:37:47] unto us the word of reconciliation that
[1:37:50] word of reconciliation is going to go to
[1:37:52] the to witness through the two witnesses
[1:37:54] for the 144,000 and they're going to
[1:37:58] born again they're going to receive the
[1:38:00] new birth now they're not going to be
[1:38:02] bribed they've lost that position do you
[1:38:04] understand that but they will have the
[1:38:06] same Holy Ghost you get or there's two
[1:38:09] different Holy Ghost
[1:38:10] let's read zechariah 12 914 it's that
[1:38:14] all about the atonement of the new birth
[1:38:15] so there's your three processes they go
[1:38:17] through three processes just like you do
[1:38:19] you know why cause brother Brown said
[1:38:21] future home ready the other day I heard
[1:38:24] it the other day going up the road he
[1:38:26] said since the boy I taught those three
[1:38:29] processes you know what them three
[1:38:30] processes if it's good enough for seven
[1:38:33] churches it's good enough for 144,000
[1:38:37] because God don't change his word amen
[1:38:40] Zechariah 12 verse 9 this is last one
[1:38:43] that will musicians come after this they
[1:38:46] shall come to pass in that day that I
[1:38:47] will seek to destroy all the nations
[1:38:49] that come against Israel because watch
[1:38:52] we're coming up to the time where he's
[1:38:53] gonna break that covenant then there's
[1:38:55] gonna be a battle of Armageddon right
[1:38:57] here we're gonna talk about that this
[1:38:58] afternoon
[1:38:59] alright then prove it by the Bible that
[1:39:03] after the 1260 days the two witnesses
[1:39:07] 144,000 they going to rapture there's
[1:39:09] nothing left but destruction okay that's
[1:39:13] why that there can't be only
[1:39:14] three-and-a-half years left because you
[1:39:15] can't you're not finished with the six
[1:39:17] fold purpose the sixth fold purpose has
[1:39:19] to happen inside 70 weeks and annual
[1:39:22] that's according to the Bible all right
[1:39:25] and I will pour upon the house of David
[1:39:27] upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the
[1:39:29] spirit of grace and of supplication and
[1:39:32] they shall look upon me whom they have
[1:39:34] pierced and they shall mourn for me what
[1:39:37] as one mourning for his own son and
[1:39:40] shall be in bitterness for him as one
[1:39:42] that is in bitterness for his first
[1:39:44] board in that day there shall be a great
[1:39:46] mourning in Jerusalem not all over the
[1:39:49] world 144,000 in that day there'll be a
[1:39:55] great mourning in Jerusalem as the
[1:39:57] mourning of how to remain in the valley
[1:39:58] of megiddo what where's the Battle of
[1:40:01] Armageddon you went to both the Megiddo
[1:40:03] is a valley right there outside of
[1:40:05] Jerusalem all right and the land shall
[1:40:08] mourn the people
[1:40:11] and the land and the land shall mourn
[1:40:15] every family apart in the family of the
[1:40:19] house of David apart and their wives
[1:40:21] apart in the family of the house of
[1:40:23] Nathan apart and their wives apart and
[1:40:25] the family of the house of Levi apart
[1:40:27] and their wife depart family shamaya
[1:40:28] apart of their wives apart all the
[1:40:31] families that remain every family apart
[1:40:33] in their wives apart what they're gonna
[1:40:34] do they're gonna mourn they realized
[1:40:37] they killed them aside 2,000 years ago
[1:40:40] and God's gonna say they shall look upon
[1:40:42] me whom they have pierced and that's
[1:40:46] what's gonna happen is when that hundred
[1:40:48] and forty four thousand is saved God's
[1:40:50] gonna take them in a rapture and then
[1:40:52] there will be no one left on this earth
[1:40:55] that has the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:40:57] will be gone off of this earth they'll
[1:40:58] sure they'll be a there'll be a foolish
[1:41:02] virgin but they didn't receive the Holy
[1:41:03] Ghost there'll be a cup of water of my
[1:41:06] name there'll be all these different
[1:41:07] people that has to stay on the earth
[1:41:09] brother Brown says has to go through the
[1:41:10] tribulation to be purified but if you
[1:41:13] got your baptism the Holy Ghost you
[1:41:15] can't stay here
[1:41:17] Jew or Gentile Jew or Gentile so now
[1:41:21] what we've done is now we're going to
[1:41:23] regroup we're going to regroup tonight
[1:41:25] this afternoon we're going to review
[1:41:27] some of this show where the Battle of
[1:41:29] Armageddon is and then see the other
[1:41:31] half of that 70th week because one week
[1:41:35] equals what seven years not three and a
[1:41:39] half years all right let's stand to our
[1:41:40] feet musicians come you love the Lord
[1:41:52] we're a word born bride so we can't be
[1:41:56] born or nothing else we got to be born
[1:41:59] by the word and if that words anointed
[1:42:03] and you receive it then kind of helps
[1:42:06] you be annoying but that's part of this
[1:42:08] that's three of the six little purpose
[1:42:10] you know what that does that gets the
[1:42:12] people redeemed but we got to get Al and
[1:42:16] redeem member it's to Jerusalem I mean
[1:42:20] Daniels our people and the city well the
[1:42:23] city can't be redeemed
[1:42:25] until after the Battle of Armageddon
[1:42:27] because if you redeem it before and then
[1:42:30] you have a balla Armageddon you
[1:42:34] destroyed what you just built but a
[1:42:36] little because the Millennial temple is
[1:42:38] going to be built got to be built after
[1:42:40] the Battle of Armageddon and when he
[1:42:42] cuts us when the Antichrist cuts them
[1:42:46] off in the midst of the week which is 2
[1:42:49] 1260 days then he's going to step into
[1:42:52] the tabernacle or the the Holy of Holies
[1:42:55] and he said I'm God and they're gonna go
[1:42:59] no you're not
[1:43:00] boom boom boom then everybody's gonna
[1:43:02] start destroying each other but you know
[1:43:03] what we're gonna be in glory we're not
[1:43:05] gonna be here what I said before if they
[1:43:08] if you never get a revelation of
[1:43:09] anything of this message you get one
[1:43:11] revelation if you're born again you will
[1:43:14] not have to go through the tribulation
[1:43:16] period you will not have to stand before
[1:43:19] the white throne judgment so thank God
[1:43:21] for that
[1:43:21] amen let's think it's on page 1
