[0:02] am aren't you glad we're not under an
[0:05] American Spirit we're part of the
[0:08] kingdom of God that changes our
[0:10] nature well we're just going to continue
[0:12] studying through uh First Corinthians
[0:14] this morning the um the first chapter
[0:17] and and get to the end of the first
[0:18] chapter and just we're just taking some
[0:20] little uh thoughts from from from the
[0:22] different things that Paul said and this
[0:24] morning I just want to take a little
[0:25] thought from you um that where he said
[0:27] you you see your calling brethren and
[0:30] he's talking about how your um God takes
[0:32] the the base things and makes something
[0:34] out of it and uh and and and and he kind
[0:38] of runs that thought like that but let's
[0:40] just go to the Lord in prayer before we
[0:41] get into this Lord we're so grateful to
[0:43] be able to gather around your word this
[0:45] morning I pray you gu guide us through
[0:46] your scriptures Lord make it a living
[0:48] reality to us this morning I pray God
[0:51] that you'll prepare our hearts Lord
[0:52] Jesus and bless our precious brother as
[0:54] she's preparing to bring us the word oh
[0:56] God and just be with us that that we'll
[0:58] be receptive and and and just uh Lord
[1:00] that you'll guide it Quicken it to us
[1:02] Lord we pray in your name
[1:06] amen but now to back up and and uh we
[1:09] were looking at the little thought that
[1:11] Paul was saying in verse 18 of 1
[1:13] Corinthians chapter 1 where he was uh
[1:16] talking about the preaching of the Cross
[1:18] is the power of God so he said for the
[1:19] preaching of the Cross is to them that
[1:22] perish foolishness but unto us which are
[1:25] saved it is the power of God and and you
[1:30] we were you know meditating on
[1:32] how that that's that's in the book of
[1:35] Acts Simon the Sorcerer uh was trying to
[1:37] attract all the attention to him and
[1:39] trying to uh put the focus on him and he
[1:42] was putting forth that he was the great
[1:43] power of God but the power of God is
[1:45] actually in his word not in a a
[1:47] particular you know Pulpit Ministry or a
[1:50] particular movement like that but it's
[1:51] the word it's the word of God and and
[1:54] when we say it's the power of God it's
[1:56] because the word of God will actually
[1:58] it's not just like a education or not
[2:00] just a Theology of some things that you
[2:01] pack in your head to to know but it's
[2:04] actually the word of God will actually
[2:06] express it will Express deity it will in
[2:10] other words it'll bring to reality the
[2:12] things that are laying here in the
[2:13] scripture and so that's the power the
[2:15] power of God will is it's the the it's
[2:18] it's it's the um the power of God in the
[2:21] word to to bring Liberty to change your
[2:23] life to change things to to express his
[2:26] deity in your life so it says for it is
[2:29] written I will d destroy the wisdom of
[2:30] the wise and will bring to nothing the
[2:33] understanding of The Prudent where is
[2:34] the wise where is the Scribe where is
[2:36] the disputer of this world hath not God
[2:39] made foolish the wisdom of the world now
[2:42] what what he's talking about here is
[2:43] that in your learning and your and all
[2:46] the Scholastic exercises all the
[2:49] theology there's no way that you can
[2:50] know anything about deity there's no way
[2:52] that you could get Liberty from the
[2:53] bondage that sin has placed in your life
[2:55] there's no way you can know God so he
[2:58] he's he's he's framing it up that all
[3:01] this wisdom that the world has it's it's
[3:03] not going to bring you any salvation
[3:04] it's not going to get you anywhere you
[3:06] know at the end of the road no matter if
[3:08] you've got as much money in the bank as
[3:10] Bill Gates or as much money in the bank
[3:11] as Elon Musk at the end of the road
[3:13] what's that going to do for you so where
[3:15] is the wise where is the Scribe where is
[3:17] the disputer of this world hath not God
[3:19] made foolish the wisdom of this world
[3:22] for after that in the wisdom of God the
[3:24] World by wisdom knew not God it pleased
[3:26] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[3:30] save them that believe for the Jews
[3:33] require a sign and the Greeks seek after
[3:36] wisdom but we preach Christ crucified
[3:40] under the Jews a stumbling block and
[3:43] under the Greeks foolishness but under
[3:45] them which are called both Jews and
[3:47] Greeks Christ the power of God and the
[3:50] wisdom of God because the foolishness of
[3:53] God is wiser than men now now he's
[3:56] framing it up that preaching and the
[3:58] word of God and you know him standing
[4:00] there in the in the in the Greek
[4:02] amphitheaters and laying out out to to
[4:05] these Greek people that knew all knew
[4:07] all these different languages and had
[4:08] all this wisdom of the world to them it
[4:11] seemed like a bunch of foolishness to
[4:12] the Jews it seemed like something to
[4:14] just stumble over and and so he's
[4:16] framing it up that you know the Jews
[4:17] were looking they they you're preaching
[4:19] about a crucified Messiah and you're
[4:22] saying all these things that stum they
[4:24] stumbled over because they were looking
[4:25] for things to come in a totally
[4:27] different way now so he's he's using
[4:29] this word a stumbling block which is
[4:31] used repeated throughout the scripture
[4:33] stumbling
[4:35] Stone all throughout the New Testament
[4:37] this this uh this phrase is used to
[4:39] repeat how the reaction that many people
[4:42] have to the preaching of the Gospel but
[4:44] that is how God uh brings about
[4:47] salvation it's through this this the
[4:49] simp the the simple
[4:51] foolishness uh is what people would say
[4:54] foolishness of the preaching of the
[4:56] Gospel in Isaiah Isaiah said he shall be
[4:59] a saint uary but for a stone of
[5:01] stumbling and a rock of offense to both
[5:04] the houses of Israel for a Jin and for a
[5:06] snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[5:09] and many among them s shall stumble and
[5:11] fall and be broken and be snared and be
[5:13] taken and first Peter Echoes that where
[5:16] he says it's contained in the scripture
[5:19] behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone
[5:21] elect precious and he that believeth on
[5:24] him shall not be confounded unto you
[5:26] therefore which believe he is precious
[5:28] but unto them which be dis obedient the
[5:31] stone which the builders disallowed the
[5:34] same as made of the head of the corner
[5:37] the head of the corner and a stone of
[5:39] stumbling and a rock you you know you
[5:41] think I I just Illustrated here with a
[5:43] little picture of well we'll make it a a
[5:45] little triangular like a little pyramid
[5:47] Stone laying there on the ground that
[5:49] everybody would think it's nothing just
[5:51] a little simple would put it put it over
[5:53] in the New Testament terms in a Manger
[5:56] that everybody would oh he's in a little
[5:58] baby crying in the mang danger with the
[6:00] donkeys and all of those things around
[6:02] and that's the thing that they stumble
[6:04] over even to them which stumble at the
[6:07] word being disobedient but but now
[6:09] really to put it in the the right
[6:11] context this stone is it's like the
[6:13] foundation stone of a work of God it's
[6:16] the it's the starting point of your life
[6:18] as a Christian it's the starting point
[6:20] of the of the of the church everything
[6:23] is built upon this Stone and and what
[6:26] brother Brandon would frame it up as
[6:28] it's the Holy Ghost and and you know
[6:31] many people they they'll think well what
[6:33] is the Holy Ghost they well the Holy
[6:34] Ghost is running and shouting it's
[6:36] emotion and those kind of things but the
[6:38] Holy Ghost is a person it's actually
[6:40] that it's when Christ died on the cross
[6:43] he shed his life so that that P his
[6:45] deity could come back and live in the in
[6:47] the church and so what stumbles people
[6:50] is when they see when they see the uh
[6:53] you know he said my word is spirit my
[6:56] words are life that the word preached
[6:59] actually manifest deity in the lives of
[7:01] the Believers and it causes something
[7:02] that they they'll stumble at and so and
[7:06] and what this what the the the um New
[7:09] Testament is quoting from all these
[7:11] different individuals Peter and Paul and
[7:12] so forth they're quoting from in Psalm
[7:14] chapter 118 Verse 22 where it says the
[7:17] stone which the builders refuse is
[7:20] become The Headstone of the
[7:22] corner brother Brown would say in the
[7:25] building down here the next chapter that
[7:28] in this building there was one stone
[7:29] stone that was actually too odd to fool
[7:31] with so the builders rejected it so they
[7:35] just pitched it over in the corner said
[7:38] that stone is actually too odd to be
[7:40] used there's no such a place now
[7:43] remember it was the builders who should
[7:46] have know different Jesus spoke of it
[7:49] now you can follow that line of thought
[7:50] all the way through this in the in the
[7:53] uh when uh when John the Baptist began
[7:56] to speak it just threw them into that it
[7:59] was so different that they discarded
[8:02] what he was preaching and Jesus come on
[8:04] the scene and they discarded what he was
[8:06] preaching and all the way down till this
[8:08] age where they discard they they stumble
[8:10] over the revealed word of the hour being
[8:12] preached in power and demonstration and
[8:15] they discard it when it's the very thing
[8:17] that will finish the building he said
[8:20] but to come to find out they had built
[8:21] the building so high until they missed
[8:24] the stone and they didn't know where
[8:26] that stone was they might have searched
[8:27] all the ships they might have run
[8:29] through every Ox cart they might have
[8:30] sent messages up into japa and down say
[8:33] has another load come in or did you lose
[8:35] one on the road there's something wrong
[8:38] we just can't find that stone for this
[8:39] place and when they could not find it
[8:41] nowhere else come to find out it was
[8:45] right on the ground now a't that amazing
[8:47] how he lays that out in so such
[8:49] Simplicity where are you looking for it
[8:50] it's not it's not high up and some
[8:53] behind some stained glass windows or
[8:54] something but it's just right on the
[8:56] ground it was the Chief Cornerstone that
[8:59] the Builder is rejected and all of these
[9:01] scriptures in the new at Psalm 118
[9:03] Isaiah 28 Matthew 21 where Jesus said
[9:06] didn't you read in the scriptures the
[9:07] stone which the builders rejected
[9:09] Ephesians 2:19 now therefore ye are no
[9:12] more strangers and followers but the F
[9:15] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[9:16] Saints and of the household of God and
[9:18] are built upon the foundation of the
[9:20] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[9:23] himself being the Chief
[9:25] Cornerstone and whom all the building
[9:28] fitly framed together groweth unto an
[9:30] Holy Temple in the Lord and whom you
[9:32] also are builded together for in
[9:34] habitation of God through the spirit and
[9:36] first Peter quotes that we we just read
[9:38] a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[9:41] offense a stone of stumbling and a rock
[9:43] of offense because the Jews would look
[9:44] at this they' look at Christ the person
[9:46] of Christ and they would they it would
[9:48] stumble and he said in the message
[9:50] dedication he said that's why the bride
[9:51] building of Christ is not ready for the
[9:53] bridegroom bringing it on over to today
[9:56] is because that the builders has
[9:58] rejected the Chief Cornerstone that was
[10:00] laid on the day of Pentecost which is
[10:03] the baptism of the Holy Spirit now
[10:06] what's the baptism of the Holy Spirit In
[10:07] this case it's the person the person of
[10:09] Jesus Christ the person is what people
[10:12] are rejecting and what what manifests
[10:15] the person in this day is the word of
[10:17] God it's been odd people act funny and
[10:20] they don't come into the order of our
[10:21] psychology of our educational our
[10:23] learning our Creeds that don't fit in
[10:25] there and they kicked it out because it
[10:27] was too odd too peculiar too
[10:30] disagreeable with the plans that we as
[10:32] men had ideas of what the church ought
[10:35] to be now now this is what Paul's
[10:37] framing up as it's a stumbling block to
[10:39] the Jews and to the Greeks it's a
[10:41] stumble something to stumble over now
[10:44] now Daniel talked about a stone and and
[10:46] and you know you could the way he Daniel
[10:48] framed it up there's a a stone that come
[10:50] out of hued out of a mountain bring it
[10:52] over into the modern day or to this day
[10:54] that we're living in and there's a a
[10:56] cloud that came out of the heavens and
[10:58] both of those things signify the same
[11:00] thing that God God uh by his God is
[11:04] manifesting himself in authority to take
[11:07] over the kingdoms of this of this world
[11:09] by that little stone that the world
[11:11] stumbles over by by that little Stone
[11:13] and what was the Holy Ghost given for it
[11:16] it just call out that it what was the
[11:18] Holy Ghost given for because that's what
[11:20] we're talking about the Holy Ghost is
[11:22] what stumbles people and in that sermon
[11:24] brother R was framing out that there's a
[11:26] stone cut out of the mountain without
[11:28] hands that rolled into the world and
[11:31] smashed it out and what Daniel was
[11:33] talking about is that image of
[11:35] Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[11:36] where the stone hued out of the mountain
[11:39] comes and Strikes strikes what the the
[11:41] world systems and in other words God's
[11:44] taken over he's taken over the world
[11:46] systems he's taking over the kingdoms of
[11:48] your your uh you know all the things
[11:51] that uh uh afflict you in your life he's
[11:54] taking over he's changing your nature
[11:56] he's changing your being until it it
[11:59] it's just a holy ghost takeover and so
[12:01] he said that let that stone the Christ
[12:03] Jesus that stumbling Stone to the world
[12:06] a stone of offense a laughing Stone a
[12:08] stumbling block to the church but a
[12:10] precious and a load Stone to the
[12:12] believer a stone of assurance a stone of
[12:15] rest I know that I pass from Death un
[12:18] life my soul is at rest Oh Come unto me
[12:22] all ye that labor and heavy laden and
[12:24] I'll give you rest to your soul a sign
[12:26] that's to be evil spoken of said the
[12:28] prophet to Mary it'll be a sign sure it
[12:30] will but it'll be an assurance it'll be
[12:33] a love uh it'll be a satisfaction it'll
[12:36] be something that you know you've passed
[12:39] from Death un life a stone like uh the
[12:43] Jesus said told Peter that I'll build my
[12:45] church upon this this rock this Stone
[12:48] the rock of the revelation of Jesus
[12:50] Christ and and even in this in this
[12:52] story of of the rock coming out of the
[12:55] mountain that Daniel saw that rock that
[12:57] stone would actually grow into a
[13:00] mountain and Daniel said in in Chapter 2
[13:02] of Daniel then was the iron the clay the
[13:05] brass the silver and the gold broken to
[13:07] pieces together because it's a holy
[13:09] ghost takeover and became like the chaff
[13:11] of the summer threshing floors and the
[13:13] wind carried them away that no place was
[13:15] found for them and the stone that smoke
[13:18] the image become a great mountain and
[13:20] fill the whole earth I wonder what that
[13:23] mountain looked like and his you know if
[13:25] we could kind of it it must have maybe
[13:28] looked like this because when you get
[13:29] born again it's it God begins to take
[13:32] over your life he begins to grow until
[13:34] he just consumes everything this Stone
[13:37] the stone is what the the world has
[13:39] rejected and in the 70th week of Daniel
[13:42] he said this rejected Stone to the
[13:44] pyramid cut out of the mountain cut out
[13:47] without hands it wasn't something God
[13:49] did it I mean that the man did or not
[13:51] any denominational system but God sent
[13:54] it he said without hands God sent it the
[13:57] rejected one the rejected Stone is the
[13:59] head the Capstone and the Very one that
[14:02] they've rejected through this Gentile
[14:04] age is Christ and Christ was not cut and
[14:07] put in here as a Vicor or Son of God or
[14:10] some great dignitary in the church he's
[14:12] the Holy Spirit and the cap of the
[14:15] pyramid will be Christ coming do you see
[14:19] it and Jesus keeps all his appointments
[14:22] he said when Enoch and them in the early
[14:24] days built the pyramids down in Egypt
[14:25] they knew that the Cornerstone the
[14:27] Capstone will be rejected
[14:29] and you can see there there's the top of
[14:31] the Great Pyramid it doesn't have a
[14:32] Capstone on
[14:33] it and that pyramid is put so perfectly
[14:36] together till they don't need mortar it
[14:38] was so mechanically hued out until one
[14:40] stone fits against the other so tight
[14:43] you can't even put a razor blade between
[14:44] it and most of the casing stones on the
[14:46] Great Pyramid are gone but you can see
[14:48] there in the bottom left I got a little
[14:49] picture of the casing stones that are
[14:51] left and you can't put a razor between
[14:53] them that's how tight they are now just
[14:56] keep heaping up and now it's all honed
[14:58] off on top ready for the Capstone when
[15:00] it will come that's the way God has
[15:02] brought his church from
[15:05] justification
[15:06] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[15:08] Spirit and now the ministry of the
[15:11] spirit which is what quickens the word
[15:13] that Ministry in the church will have to
[15:15] be just exactly like his now it's so
[15:19] simple and so different from the way the
[15:22] world expects that it stumbles over
[15:24] people so simple and that's where Paul
[15:27] we're getting to you you see your
[15:29] calling Brethren how God can take a
[15:31] simple word a and make it something that
[15:34] will will turn into a mount he can make
[15:36] just something as simple as a little
[15:37] baby in a manger and make it grow into
[15:39] something that will take over the world
[15:41] systems and take something as simple as
[15:44] where you come from in your own
[15:45] background a a sinner saved by grace and
[15:48] turn you into a child of God and change
[15:50] your life to make you different take
[15:52] something that's worth nothing and make
[15:54] it something that's got real true value
[15:57] now that's what he's saying in verse 6
[15:59] for ye see your calling
[16:03] Brethren now see Paul Paul lays out
[16:06] these things to give us confidence that
[16:08] we're not here like like we were saying
[16:10] looking for the power of God in a man or
[16:13] in a system or in the church we go to
[16:16] but we're looking for the power our
[16:18] source of power comes from the word of
[16:20] God that we believe so when you look
[16:22] into a scripture like this and it says
[16:24] it ech goes back can do you see your
[16:26] calling do you see where you come from
[16:27] and what God has called you for for that
[16:29] there's a purpose in your life that
[16:30] you're here to fulfill for ye see your
[16:33] calling brother and how that not many
[16:34] wise men after the flesh not many mighty
[16:38] not many noble are called but God ha
[16:41] chosen the foolish things of the
[16:43] world to confound the wise and God has
[16:47] chosen the weak things to confound the
[16:49] things which are Mighty and base things
[16:52] of the world and things which are
[16:54] despised at God chosen Y and things
[16:56] which are not to bring to not things
[16:59] that are what does that mean things
[17:01] which are not to bring to not things
[17:03] that are it it means that God can bring
[17:06] something that you can't even see like
[17:08] faith and make it manifest he can bring
[17:11] so it's it's something that you where
[17:13] are you going to put your finger on love
[17:14] or humility and and he can take those
[17:17] things which look like there's nothing
[17:18] to it and actually put it in a church
[17:21] where the church is filled with love and
[17:23] humility and faith and godliness and all
[17:25] those things things which you can't put
[17:27] your finger on but the is expressed and
[17:30] so that's what this is talking about
[17:31] that God can take take things that the
[17:33] world has no it looks like there's no
[17:35] value to it and and and manifest it to a
[17:38] place where it's just taking over
[17:40] everything so all all you look at all
[17:42] these scriptures of of that Echo just
[17:45] like just like our own lives you can
[17:47] look back through the scripture and
[17:48] identify you yourself with all these
[17:50] characters like Moses that had a speech
[17:52] impediment and Ruth a little moabit
[17:54] Widow and we could go on and on through
[17:56] all these Amos a shepherd and a fig
[17:58] farmer
[17:59] Elisha a little farmer who didn't even
[18:02] know really what he was doing you know
[18:04] plowing behind the cattle Samuel A Child
[18:07] serving in the temple jeffa the son of a
[18:10] prostitute rejected by his own family
[18:12] and God takes these people and through
[18:15] the word that the world has disregarded
[18:17] and just treated like something just to
[18:19] stumble over he takes these individuals
[18:21] and brings them to their predestinated
[18:24] calling what's your calling your calling
[18:25] is the purpose in your life that God had
[18:29] for you that he made you to fulfill that
[18:31] he knew you would fulfill from before
[18:33] the foundation of the world and brother
[18:36] Rand would say he said you know if
[18:37] you're called to be a musician you can
[18:40] you could somebody somebody that's not
[18:41] called to be a musician can take all the
[18:43] lessons and everything but if you're
[18:45] called to be a musician you'll be able
[18:47] to do it in a way that nobody else can
[18:49] do it if you're called to be a little a
[18:51] little homemaker that that's your
[18:53] purpose in life then there's something
[18:55] in you that
[18:59] it's your calling that when you hear the
[19:01] word of God and it brings you to a line
[19:03] with what God wants you to do it
[19:05] manifests in a way that the rest of the
[19:06] world can't do it and if you're called
[19:08] to be a preacher you can study if you're
[19:11] not called you can study and try and try
[19:13] to act like a preacher but you'll never
[19:15] be able to do it if you're unless in a
[19:18] way that somebody that's really called
[19:20] to do it called in other words it's what
[19:24] God thought that you thought and planned
[19:27] for you from for the foundation of the
[19:30] world so that's what he's trying to
[19:31] express to the Corinthians you see you
[19:34] see your calling Brethren where God took
[19:37] you and molded you and put you into a
[19:40] place to match up to align with go what
[19:43] he knew you would be from before the
[19:45] foundation of the world like like for
[19:47] example we'll look at little Gideon that
[19:49] that somebody just of a low social
[19:51] status weakest Clan and manasse the and
[19:53] the least in his family fearful hiding
[19:56] in a wine press to avoid the medidan no
[19:59] experience no background in leadership
[20:01] or Warfare all these doubts question
[20:04] God's presence and care for Israel uh
[20:07] and and super hesitant but God raised
[20:09] him up to go to battle and so that he
[20:12] would use him in a mighty way and now
[20:15] same thing with all of these people that
[20:17] we just read we're just looking at and
[20:19] and when you look at these it echoes the
[20:21] plan and purpose in your own life that's
[20:24] how you get your identification from the
[20:26] scripture not from a particular person
[20:29] not from a particular church that you're
[20:31] going to that's why I believe that the
[20:33] bride is moving away from Pulpit
[20:35] Ministries and special Ministries where
[20:37] we're looking as individuals but it's a
[20:39] bride body Ministry where the bride body
[20:42] as a whole is preaching the gospel to
[20:45] bring the bride collectively to a place
[20:47] where she knows what she's doing and why
[20:49] she's here so you see your calling your
[20:51] calling renates relates to God's unique
[20:54] plan for your life that leads to his
[20:56] glory and the benefit of his kingdom
[20:59] God will call you to Salvation like in
[21:01] Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did
[21:04] predestinate them he also
[21:06] called and whom he called them he also
[21:10] Justified and whom he justified them he
[21:12] also
[21:13] glorified so if you're
[21:15] predestinated you're
[21:17] called it could be a call to service in
[21:20] Ephesians 4:11 he gave some Apostles
[21:23] some prophets some some evangelists and
[21:24] some pastors and
[21:26] teachers so he calls to Ministry and you
[21:30] know I we we'll look at this closely but
[21:32] when God calls you it's not
[21:35] like he he didn't think about it and
[21:37] then all of a sudden he calls you it's
[21:40] it's from before the foundation of the
[21:42] world he knew you were going to come to
[21:44] it exactly a call to Holiness in 1 Peter
[21:47] 1:15 but as he which hath called you is
[21:50] Holy so be ye holy and all manner of
[21:54] conversation so God is calling us these
[21:57] predestinated believers that he knew
[21:59] what you would do with it before the
[22:00] foundation of the world and he had it
[22:01] waiting for you he's calling to
[22:03] Salvation then he's calling to service
[22:06] he's got different roles different thing
[22:09] different thing jobs for us to do that
[22:11] he calls you to and he's calling us to
[22:14] Holiness and probably a whole lot of
[22:15] other things that we could lay out here
[22:17] in the scripture so when God calls you
[22:19] to Salvation he's calling you to a holy
[22:20] life he has called you the one that's
[22:23] called us is
[22:25] Holy brother R would say in questions
[22:28] and answers he' say now you say brother
[22:30] brandom told me told me I ought to do
[22:33] that see and maybe what if something
[22:35] happened to brother brandom I get killed
[22:37] or die or or get away now see this is
[22:39] the danger of looking at an individual
[22:42] like we were looking at last Sunday
[22:44] putting all of your identity on an
[22:45] individual or a church or something like
[22:47] that or a movement he said then see your
[22:51] calling goes over then but but if Jesus
[22:54] calls you if you're relying solely on
[22:56] the word of God for your identity
[22:59] if Jesus calls you brother as long as
[23:01] there's an eternity it'll still be
[23:03] ringing out see and then you know where
[23:07] you're
[23:08] standing in Romans 11: 29 it says for
[23:12] the gifts and calling of God are without
[23:14] repentance so and that's going back to
[23:16] the idea that the that your calling is
[23:19] not something that happens here in time
[23:21] there's a point in time where you you
[23:23] come to realize your calling but your
[23:25] calling is from before the foundation of
[23:28] the world and we'll be closing here in
[23:29] just a moment I'm not trying to wear
[23:31] everybody
[23:33] out uh the Bible also says brother BR
[23:36] would say I I just got some quotes here
[23:38] of some things that he said about
[23:39] calling he said the Bible says gifts and
[23:41] callings are without repentance not what
[23:45] you are repenting not none of your
[23:46] righteousness like not gifts and
[23:48] callings are without repentance it's
[23:50] God's for
[23:52] knowledge and he said it's not what you
[23:54] try to work yourself up to it's what
[23:57] you're born to
[24:00] be another place he said Jesus Christ
[24:03] was the son of God from the Garden of
[24:05] Eden Moses was born in the world a
[24:08] prophet a right
[24:09] child John the Baptist 712 years before
[24:13] he was born was the voice of one crying
[24:15] in the wilderness Isaiah saw him God
[24:18] told Jeremiah before you was even formed
[24:21] in your mother's womb I knew you and S
[24:24] and Sanctified you and ordained you a
[24:26] prophet to the Nations but you see it's
[24:29] without repentance in otherwi in other
[24:32] words you're called before you ever
[24:33] repent it's without repentance before
[24:36] you repent you're already
[24:39] called he said now let me explain it one
[24:42] more time so that you'll thoroughly
[24:44] understand and we'll we'll stop on this
[24:45] and musicians can go ahead and come
[24:47] forward he said gifts and callings are
[24:49] without repentance do you know that you
[24:52] can never make something make yourself
[24:55] something that you're not you born in
[24:57] this world sovereignly by God with
[25:00] different things to
[25:01] do and in in the message why I'm praying
[25:04] for the sick he said I believe that
[25:07] gifts and callings are without
[25:08] repentance see there's no way at all for
[25:10] you to do anything I believe in the
[25:13] election of God that God does the
[25:14] electing God does the calling you taking
[25:17] thought could not add one cubit to your
[25:19] stature see but whatever God has
[25:21] determined to be it will be and you are
[25:24] called by
[25:26] election so if you're called to be a
[25:28] Christian Christian if you're called to
[25:29] be a housewife called to be a preacher
[25:32] God's got that laying there for you and
[25:35] the word will bring it to pass that you
[25:37] just step into it and accept what God's
[25:40] got that little role that special role
[25:42] that God's got laying there for you
[25:45] before we close let's just go to the
[25:46] Lord in prayer Lord God we're so
[25:48] grateful for your word to give us
[25:49] encouragement and the hour that we're
[25:51] living in Lord and to to place us
[25:53] correctly Lord Jesus to give us that
[25:55] little booster of Faith Lord Jesus to
[25:57] believe I believe this morning that we
[25:59] can see our calling laying there in the
[26:01] scripture Lord Jesus identified by by by
[26:04] the word Lord we can look uh steadfastly
[26:06] and boldly at the at these promises
[26:08] laying there and recognize our
[26:10] identification and see our calling I
[26:13] pray God that you'll just bless the
[26:14] remainder of the service today bless
[26:16] brother Tim as he's preparing I pray God
[26:18] that you'll just be with us now we pray
[26:20] in your name amen God bless you Saints
