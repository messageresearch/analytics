the rain you faced through the wind you faced through the dark clouds amen to come and hear his word praise god god's got a reward for you i believe that amen so we just thank god for for that and you know when one some one of us is missing you know it you can you can you can feel it you can you can experience it for example here the musicians were playing i could tell something was not there it was the base because richard's not here right now so and so see when when you're not here amen we feel it that's right amen because why we're one body that's right amen we're one body and we're connected by that eternal life amen we feel it amen so so it's uh so important amen to make sure that we're we're here amen when those doors are open amen praise god amen so if you have your scriptures this afternoon i'd like to uh uh turn if you turn with me to first corinthians chapter two first corinthians chapter two and uh we're gonna we're gonna continue with a little thought that we we had last last time that we preached when the word sees the word this is part two and we're going to talk a little bit about the wisdom of god amen abiding in the wisdom of god and so uh this uh you know the scripture talks of some things here regarding the wisdom of god but it it uh it's very interesting very interesting what the word says about it so uh so let's just let's just go let's just go to the lord in prayer first and then we'll read the word our heavenly father we thank you once again one for your the opportunity to open back the pages of your word lord we would just ask you now father god that you would have your will in your way in this in this hour lord father it's our it's our lot lord to speak your word when we ask father that you would just use my lips lord to say exactly what the people need father god and not necessarily what i want to say but what you want to say lord anoint my lips so the lord god almighty you would speak exactly according to your oracles father uh bless those that are not here all the needs they were mentioned lord brother joe and and and richard's mom lord god and all the needs that were mentioned you know all of them lord every detail father god you knew that even before the foundation of the world lord and so we ask you father that you'd come down and be with with meet these needs lord and father god raise those that need father god this special touch from you lord we commit the rest of the service now into your hands thank you father for all your blessings in jesus christ's name amen all right we're going to read this this this whole chapter and i'll just read it real we'll try to go real quick and then we'll be seated so um first corinthians chapter 2 and our brethren when i came to you came not with the with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power they meant that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of god amen that's where we want to be amen praise god how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not in other words that they they're not going to be all the wisdom all the books that you see in the in the library and everything eventually that will not come to be the only wisdom that will stand is the word of god amen praise god so how important it is to have that word in you already amen that's the wisdom that we want praise god but we speak verse 7 but we speak listen to this but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained watch before the world unto our glory amen i like that which none of the princess of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but that is it but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him amen but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god amen if you have the spirit in you amen you're going to want to thirst more and more for this word amen not just be satisfied with one portion you want the whole counsel of god amen for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god so you're going to know the things of of man because you're the natural man that's all he knows right but when you have the spirit of god in you amen it's going to lead you to the word amen praise god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god and remember it were given to us even on before the foundation of the world amen in him what which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things amen i think that's important but he that is spiritual judgeth all things in other words you'll have the wisdom to judge all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him in other words who you do you know god enough do you know the mind of the lord for you to tell him what to do you see but now watch what watch what paul says here but we have the mind of christ amen praise god you may be seated amen now so we're just going to do just a little bit of review here but i wanted to i wanted to just uh just hit up on uh just a few of these verses here that we just read real quick verse seven but we speak the wisdom of god no actually verse six how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect amen so paul here we see that paul here was differentiating between the wisdom of man and the wisdom of god so there is two different wisdoms amen there is the wisdom that you obtain by studying by by by reading uh uh as far as natural books going to school and all these things which will lead you to to the things of the world in order for you to get a job and all and all these things nothing wrong with that as long as those things are not taking you away from god amen away from the wisdom of god nothing wrong with that whatsoever as a matter of fact if you can have the wisdom of god in your life the holy spirit in your life and be at school and be a a a witness to uh go go to school go go get an education and all these things i praise god amen i believe these colleges need it amen but but but most of most of the time what happens is that we so easily get called into the wisdom of the world to the wisdom of man and easily start forgetting about the wisdom of god now the reason why i'm talking about the wisdom in in in it's because i'm contemplating on on hopefully maybe doing a series maybe on the book of proverbs and the book of proverbs is amen is the whole book about wisdom amen and it's not it's not it's it's it's spiritual wisdom but this is what i want to try to lead to is spiritual wisdom in order to help you with natural wisdom as well it it leads you to think amen in a in a more wise manner but that wisdom is tied to god's holy spirit amen in other words you must have the holy spirit of god in your life in order to act wisely fool wisely amen you cannot do it without a spirit sure you can do it with the with the wisdom uh uh uh you can get get by with your own wisdom the wisdom of man but amen we must as christians have the wisdom of god amen in order for us to live out the christian life the way we we we should amen we can't do it without christ without him we can do nothing without him we think that we are going the right way there is a way that a man thinks that that is right that he should go the bible says every one of us have been that way but most of the time we always make the wrong decision and it leads us to death amen so we want to we want to go by the wisdom of god so howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect amen are you perfect in this hour you're perfect that amen in your soul if you were born again amen so if it it that's who paul is speaking about amen so to us who are perfect that's who that wisdom resonates to amen it doesn't resonate to the world because the world knows nothing about that wisdom amen it doesn't it sounds like like a bunch of noise to them it makes them what it it it doesn't it doesn't concord a naturally to what the way they reason things out because it's foolishness to them as paul was here mentioning you see so to us though this we speak this wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not in other words you have to realize that everything that we see here in this we are living in satan's eden in this hour everything that's going on going on right now i was talking to brother joe at work this afternoon you see all these wildfires you see hurricanes you see coronavirus you see uh black live matters uh protesting and and all these things going on everywhere is just coming up on us on us more and more and more and more squeezing pressuring amen why because this is satan's eden amen and obviously the word of god needs to be fulfilled but this is satan's eden this is satan's playground so that's fine he's doing what he wants to do he's doing what he needs to do amen he hates the image of god which is in us amen he hates that so he's trying to do everything he can to destroy that image to mar that image amen he hates that therefore that's why we see the things that we are seeing in this hour amen amen so to us it's no surprise we're we don't you know we we're we don't fight against flesh and blood but against powers and principalities in the air spiritual powers that's who we fight amen but satan would want us to fight one another and look at each other as the enemy instead of looking at him instead of looking at spiritual spiritual uh uh demons amen what is that noise anyways boo devil [Laughter] amen i hear some some noise or something going on over here anyways so you see um so that's that's what we need that's what we need to be fighting in this hour now verse 7 says but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery amen that's right you see this is this this wisdom is a mystery amen to to to the world amen amen and it's a mystery to you if you don't have god in your life it's it this wisdom is the word of god amen and and and to you when you don't have that word inside of you it's a mystery it's a total mystery to you amen but god i believe has opened this thing to us in this hour amen i believe that god it's open it's an open book so it's it's if you want to take it and read it and apply it but it's a total open book the seals have been open everything's open amen so there's no excuse in this hour for you not to receive amen glory even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory amen amen that's the hidden wisdom now that wisdom amen was with god even before the foundation of the world the bible says we'll look into that here in just a moment amen but we know that what was with god before the foundation of the world well i mean we know that he's eternal life amen he is life he is light as we've been talking about lately and brother wade's been bringing out lately he is that light he is that light that that life amen he is all in all amen wisdom knowledge power everything is in there amen that's the reason why the world is the way it is amen all that and so that's why we want so we want to have that with that power in us that eternal life in us in order for us to partake of that wisdom amen that wisdom of god amen which is a mystery to the world right but it shouldn't be a mystery for the bride amen which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory amen had they known who christ really was the power that that that he was god in flesh that he was the one that they were worshiping that they would not have crucified him amen and sometimes do we know amen what we really who we really are the speak the right here by the stool oh okay there you go well we had to deal with something physical there but satan was over there rubbing that thing back in i knew i was lit hearing something thank you sisters amen praise god so um now where was i i lost my train of thought so we we see that this wisdom amen the god the the people would not have crucified jesus if they had known who he really was amen amen so now we and we can just read that we can read that you can read that uh again another time but that's a that's a very uh uh the rest of that chapter amen now let's look at let's look at this quote here the brothers can can bring this quote we read this quote last time and so um it's an excellent quote uh brother branham says this here in the church age book down through the centuries we could go we find a moses a jeremiah a john the baptist and each one of these were god's eternal thoughts expressed in its season amen they did their part they weren't speaking of themselves they were they were prophesying speaking of the coming messiah of the word amen that was to be expressed in other words what brother branham says building the body of christ amen and then he came forth later on but that word needed to be expressed by them first or needed to be be spoken amen then we come to jesus the logos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be amen so uh that because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen now it says that he have chosen us in him jesus watch now now that he has chosen us in him and jesus before the foundation of the world amen before the foundation of the world now when was this wisdom ordained unto us before the foundation of the world right that means that we were right there with him in the mind see if we stop if we just stop right there right there with him amen you'll get a lot of glory hallelujahs by that people will be shouting jumping yeah i was right there with him but but brother brown said that you were not there physically brother branham makes it clear where you were at you were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of god before the foundation of the world but that doesn't that doesn't bring down the the power a man that lays within you when you receive a man that eternal life amen that that dwelled with god even then you see amen that doesn't diminish that power amen that's the same power amen it's the same eternal life that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of god before the foundation of the world now watch that gives an eternal quality to the elect amen that gives an eternal quality to the elect but you still came here as a sinner but that but the election had already taken place in the mind of god by foreknowledge amen predestination by foreknowledge amen that is what gave you that that that eternal quality amen amen praise god you can't get away from that there's no way that you can get away from that amen god saw it before the foundation of the world therefore you have to come to it you have to come to there's no way that you cannot god god makes no mistakes he's perfect in all his ways everything he knew everything that he knows everything that that he that he will i mean he doesn't learn nothing he just knows amen praise god and he knew what you needed amen he knew that you were going to come and receive this word amen at the particular time that you did receive it amen amen praise god not one minute less not one minute more amen amen praise god that's how exact in in in that he is praise god amen so that gives an eternal quality to the elect ephesians 1 chapter 1 verses 3 and 5 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world again when was this wisdom also uh uh granted unto us before the foundation of the world amen praise god yeah i'll keep saying that because i want you to tie this wisdom to that life amen to that eternal life that we should be holy and without blame before him in love look at all these things that god predestinated us to be i'm just reading here everything that he saw about you but everything that you see when you look at yourself in the mirror and satan says to you the opposite you don't believe that you just take them back to the word and say this is how god saw me and this is how i accept it this is how i i see it and this is how i'm going to receive it and you just step right into it amen and you watch that manifest more in your life do you know that science says that whatever i mean just in the physical there's people that have been healed of cancer not even christians cancer and in in different diseases just by just by positive confessions by what you train your mind amen amen to to to to say about yourself amen that's right remember everything that's negative that and teenagers especially they they they battle with this they're in a very unstable area a part of their life and so satan uses that on instability to really attack them and so when they look at themselves in the mirror and see that pimple on their face or see the the the different changes that are taking place in their life that's when he goes on will you look how ugly you are oh look look at that nasty old black zit all along the tip of your nose and he just keeps hammering at you and keeps hammering oh it's so ugly you know now it's worse now because well at least i could cover it up with a mask now see but that's what satan that satan wants to do amen but you just take satan back to the word and he can't say nothing about that amen now you're seeing yourself like this right now amen but look how god saw you even before there was anything on the world before there was anything in the world god saw you perfect amen amen praise god take him take take i'd rather take what god said about me amen then what so anything negative that comes at you amen you can certainly you certainly know it's not from god any condemnation that comes in your life you can certainly know that it's not of god amen because there is now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus to them that are in christ jesus amen no condemnation whatsoever praise god if there is that means satan's hanging around somewhere lurking around amen and you better watch you better watch amen according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love hallelujah amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen now how did he predestinate us i'm going to take a swig of water while someone says it yeah that's right for knowledge by his foreknowledge that's how he predestinated us amen because he knew therefore he could predestinate amen praise god not anything that you did there's nothing that you could have done no there's nothing it's because he knew that it was going to be therefore he could bring that word across in your life amen and he knew that that's what you would receive amen therefore you are where you are now have you ever stopped and thought about how it is that you got to where you are now amen i i think about my way the way the way that god just just led me to even even know about the message and one of the one of the things was when i was in columbia south america when i was a baptist at the time i was 19 years old and in 1999 which was when i was when i was 19 i uh uh we we started we started uh uh uh visiting a message church there this was we're already living here but this was the first time i went back to south america to visit since i had come here to the united states i had not been back to the country in 11 years and and a brother gave us a a message book it was it was uh christ the mystery of god revealed and it was in spanish but i went in there in a little room in my in my aunt's house and started reading that little book and one of the questions that i had always had in my mind throughout my childhood throughout my teenage years and as as a christian nominal christian amen is lord why is it that we live here on this earth knowing that you you knew that we were going to sin you knew that we were gonna we were gonna come into this condition that mankind was gonna be in this terrible horrible condition that they find themselves in and why is it that you allowed it why and out of all the 1100 messages that that that i could have picked up i picked that one right because in that one is where brother branham talks about later around uh later on in that book is where he talks about that if there was no no uh if there was nobody to be saved amen then he could not present his his him being a savior or his attributes if there was nobody sick he could not show forth that he was a healer right and and when i read that i mean something just sparked in me i i got out of the bed i ran i said i cannot believe that i jumped out of the bed ran out the door and my mom was over there washing dishes or washing some clothes with my aunt and i was sitting there mom look what i was reading look what i read look what i read and i was trying to tell her i was so excited about what i just read and of course my mom you know she was kind of busy and stuff i said okay well forget it now just went back sat back down and continued reading glory and that right there just really sparked something in me it was the word that i needed a man to draw me to the word amen now brother branham spoke that not maybe not thinking you know that that would be in existence but he thought it glory the lord thought it and that is what i needed to draw me amen to this word from then on amen it was it was me after that you know seeking more what about what the message was about amen and i took i took it in wholeheartedly amen and i and i and i pray that god keeps me that way amen praise god but it was some it was something so god knew what you needed amen to draw you to this word he had that word prepared for you he had that exact word for you amen prepared for it so now let's read this this quote here uh because last time we talked about representation from predestination and let's just review that here just a moment let's read this quote here proving his word brother branham says this here he the here he's speaking about the the woman at the well the incident that took place there between christ and the woman at the well he says here why he said you've told you've told the truth see because you've had five and the one you now have is not your husband all right now see that is the word that she needed to hear she needed that word she needed that was what was going to draw her attention amen because when we look at the story we we we see that she said sir uh uh we know that when messiah cometh he'll tell us these things amen and of course jesus says i'm he that speaks with you so she knew she'd had the word already spoken to her because she said we know that messiah when he comes he'll tell us these things she had been told i think maybe brother branham might have said this i could i don't know but he might she might have she grew up her mom may be teaching her about the word and and and ta and they would hear the scribes and they would hear the priests and stuff get up and talk the words she had been taught the word but now here is the living word before her speaking the word that she needed to hear in order for that word amen to respond amen that representation amen and so brother obama says here see watch something happened see something took life now if it hadn't been in there to begin with let's see if we put a period right there it sounds like there was something in her physically that took life but that's not what it what it says it says now if it hadn't been in there to begin with watch if she hadn't have had representation from predestination and remember last time we were talking about it it's pr representation from predestination and the foreknowledge of god amen because that's where the predestination took place in god's foreknowledge amen so see in god's foreknowledge he saw that woman at the well amen responding to what jesus was saying to her there at the well therefore that if god could present that word before her and she could respond appropriately amen praise god aren't you glad that you serve a god that knows all things that's why he is the god of all wisdom so much different from the wisdom of the world and in the wisdom in the wisdom of god amen amen and that's why we need to look into the wisdom of god if she hadn't have had representation from predestination it had never took hold right that's right because god saw it therefore it must need it to take place amen and god doesn't make mistakes amen praise god their stood priests there said this man is above see no representation amen god didn't see that amen there was they god did not see them except in him when the word come can't come through now correct me if i'm wrong brothers but he did not therefore that's why they could not respond to that word amen now the priests those priests they were in the mind of god they were in the mind of god judas was in the mind of god cain was in the mind of god uh hitler was in the mind of god everybody was in the mind of god amen but only some amen were predestinated by his foreknowledge amen to come to the knowledge of this word amen see and so that's why that's why it said that i just don't want to be in the mind of god that's right because cain was in the mind of god judas was in the mind of god hitler was in the mind of god all these people amen they have committed atrocities amen throughout the world they're in the mind of god amen amen but there's a predestination of you amen praise god they were that god saw amen when that word my word comes across them they're going to receive it they're going to accept it amen praise god eternal life now watch this eternal life you always was see now you could take that a different way it's very easy see you see how people could say uh people in the message in the message ranks they could say you've always been eternal not you physically amen i don't know the eternal life has always been eternal amen the life has always been into god's lone life has always been eternal amen and if you were predestinated in there amen then yeah you're eternal amen when you receive the new birth praise god eternal life you always was see you have eternal life there's only one form of it that's god amen you were his attribute he thought of you and knowed you before the foundation of the world where in his mind amen in his mind amen not that you were there running around or that or that because then we'd go back to like pre-existence of souls and stuff like that that's that's a mormon doctrine saying that we had a meeting up there and and and that that something about satan was cast down we were the ones who cast satan down or some something on those lines in other words we were there physically and and so that's where it leads us to and we know that's anti-word amen that's anti-word it's not anywhere in the word therefore when you read these quotes of brother branham you have to make sure you take them back to the word they have to fit in with god's word they can't be they can't be just feel good things amen yeah it sounds so good yeah we were there amen predestinated before the foundation of the world running around and jumping and screaming and shouting that sounds so good that causes for a good uh meeting to jump run around as we probably have seen in the past but that doesn't bring understanding therefore doesn't bring revelation right now if you have the rev the right revelation about that and you jump and shout and scream amen praise god amen but just because amen sometimes uh if you know big name preacher amen brings those things and it makes you jump shout and feel good and scream amen without no real true revelation of what is said or what brother branham was really trying to say then then it's not it's not doing what what it's intending to do you see that's right amen and so we also looked at last time that the descript that the word representation means this is one of the best one uh uh meanings that i could find it's the description or portrayal of someone or something in a particular way or as being of a certain nature amen so you are and you're standing where you are amen because god saw that before the foundation of the world in his mind amen he knew that you would be that way he knew that you would be who you are amen and would be uh receive the word the way you receive it amen right because he he had it portrayed in his mind it was like he was watching a film amen in his mind about your life about how you were going to receive his word his eternal life amen praise god he knew all of that amen amen i invite you that if you haven't received that amen if you haven't received that word that eternal life amen in your life yeah praise god right now is the time to do it don't wait don't wait till the coronavirus stuff gets worse and and then when i see things getting worse and when i really i mean when i see things it could just be too late then don't don't my mom always told me my dad always told me don't wait to do tomorrow what you can do today because you don't have tomorrow promised amen i go back to you know you know telling you things uh as such but then also try to bring them the way that you can you can you can grasp onto them as well you see because uh uh you know sometimes we might think oh well this is just too too deep and too hard for me to amen but but in reality it's all tied into just having christ in your life to change your life amen to live a christ-like life amen it's christ in you the hope of glory that's what that's that's that's what it all boils down to and that's the mystery that satan doesn't understand he doesn't understand the mystery of the of the spirit of god living in a human being like you and doing the great things amen that he did he doesn't understand that that's why we were that's why brother wade and brother dale been speaking about how it's tying in to why satan got so mad and though and acted the way he acted towards god why because here he's he's uh and brother i like what brother dale was bringing about about michael here's michael we know that michael is christ amen and here's michael amen and he gets upset at that but then here comes and god creates amen the human being a man in his own image in his likeness satan's really really hating that image amen that's the reason why he's marring and hating the image of of humans even in this hour amen yeah and uh and and going from abortions to pedophiles and all these types of things that we see that's trying to destroy human life amen praise god all right so let's let's just read real quick genesis 1 26. and we all we all know the scripture genesis 1 20 says then god said let us make man in our image after our own likeness amen let us make man in our image after our likeness amen god is is god amen god is the word god is the logos god is eternal life exactly right and so if you if that eternal life is in you amen you were part of this man right there amen you're part of that man praise god that's why god said let us make man in our image it was that doesn't denote a trinity a lot of people think oh there's there's there's there's there's the proof that there's a trinity you know or or no amen it's just it's us in him praise god and us chosen in him amen praise god so when god made man amen when god brought adam into being amen and adam having that eternal life amen being an eternal eternal eternal being amen yes we could say that we were in there amen even then amen amen because we were part of that life you see so you have to see yourself less this way in the word you can't just see yourself over here and and god over there no you have to see yourself as part of the whole word of god even from the beginning amen and and when you see yourself that way it it makes you realize and helps you realize what kind of power lays into me amen that if i was there amen as in the in the and that eternal uh uh uh being of in that eternal life like adam had a man that same power amen that he had amen that could that could say anything i mean there was nothing that that could stop adam was supposed to be the god of this world take full control of the world god said of the earth amen and i'll and i'll guard heaven amen so how how much power lays in you amen praise god do you see what i'm trying to say with that same life it's not a different life that adam had it's the same life remember the example about the spoon the ocean water amen yes sir now we christ had that that that that fullness of the godhead bodily dwelled in him the fullness all of god amen we have it in measure but it's still the same quality it's still the same quality because it's the same elements you take a spoonful of the ocean amen you take that spoonful it has the same elements the same chemicals the same everything that the whole ocean has amen yeah therefore it could do just the same if you needed to if you need let's say for example ocean water kills toe fungus i don't know salt water amen you don't need the whole ocean to do it right amen just a little portion you see therefore amen it's just as powerful as if you had the whole ocean but the thing is that we could continue going and getting more and more in partaking of more and more and more and the word the more you partake of that ocean of the word amen the more of that ocean can heal you the more of that ocean can can save you the more that ocean can amen can just do all kinds can can impart wisdom to you you see amen praise god amen now let's let's touch up on this on this wisdom here real quick so that was just a little review of what we were talking about last last week amen for those maybe that that weren't here um let's look at this uh and going back to first corinthians chapter two verse six through seven how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory amen praise god again god ordained this so god ordained us amen in him before the foundation of what god ordained this wisdom in amen to us before the foundation of the world amen praise god now um now wisdom the dictionary says about wisdom the the uh i don't have this here but uh but you can leave that there brother uh wisdom is the ability to discern inner qualities and relationships insight amen good sense generally or judgment generally accepted belief challenges what has become accepted wisdom among many historians accumulated philosophical or scientific learning knowledge a wise attitude belief of course or course of action the teachings of the ancient wise man when you look at this word wisdom in the new testament that paul was mentioning here in first corinthians chapter 2 it's the word it's the word sophia oh and she's she's asleep so i thought maybe her eyes i was i was looking at that and i said when i would say sophia and i was just imagining her eyes get big and [Laughter] but but rachel you tell her afterwards i put her to sleep well praise god amen i did something [Laughter] amen it's the greek word sophia amen which is wisdom higher or lower worldly or spiritual wisdom amen amen so it's uh glory can be worldly or spiritual now so that means in in in different verses in the bible where it talks about wisdom if it's talking about the wisdom of man it could be the same word as well but then it could also be the same with the same word for the spiritual wisdom of god colossians chapter two let's read colossians chapter two verses one through four amen are you still with me amen i'm i'm gonna make sure i don't keep you too late tonight i wanna you don't get caught in the rain and and uh and all these things so yeah for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea so it's it's so interesting that paul here is speaking and talking about laodicea [Laughter] i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh i just say that's you and me too you know i have not seen paul in the flesh amen and here we live in laodicea you know we know that our soul is not living in laodicea but we're here in this in our in the flesh that verse two that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god there he goes again talking about the mystery of god and of the father and of christ amen verse 3 in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge where are they hidden in amen where are those treasures hidden in amen amen that's why it's so important for us to be in christ amen and christ be in us amen because without that amen you would not have access to this wisdom amen and this wisdom is part of the eternal life of god amen everything amen everything is everything that that that is that is good that is just that is peace the power of god amen dwells in that eternal life amen and in whom our head all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words in other words paul's saying i'm telling you this in case a man somebody comes through and starts speaking to you enticing in his own and in his own wisdom amen try to entice you just as the serpent did with eve amen using his own wisdom use not used 99 word but it's that one percent that'll get you that's right that one percent lie that will get you a twist of the word because that's how satan can do is pervert he has he he's no creator he can't create he has to take what already is there and just twist it pervert it make it sound like make it sound good it makes it it makes it sound like it's something genuine and something oh my because it was so good it sounded good to eve made her act you see and that's how he gets us it sounds so good and so enticing and how could it be wrong it's the word but see you're seeing the word yeah but you're not seeing that one percent because you're so caught up in the emotion and you're so caught up in the in the jumping and the screaming in the shower you're not seeing that one percent right i remember one time i was at a tent meeting it was back when i first come into the message in anderson south carolina and uh we were there at a tent meeting and uh i had a brother's tent meeting there and they had a man from out west preaching and uh and he was just preaching i mean just saying things and now the church that i was going to at the time i knew that the brother didn't believe what they were saying at the tamp meeting but and they were just shouting and screaming i mean and there was people running up and down the platform and all kinds of stuff and i was i mean it sounded really good i mean i mean and that and my and my pastor at the time he was there and he was sitting like several rows behind me and he just tapped me on my shoulder and he said hey come here and he took me out outside and he said and he said he said you see all these people i said but that i said yeah i mean it sounds like they're having a wonderful great time i mean it i mean and things are taking place i mean even people are being healed and stuff like that but he was up there preaching contrary to the word of god i mean just just slap contrary i mean bring it you know just bringing uh you know this return ministry stuff and things like that you see i mean to the fullest i mean to the point of almost worshiping brother brandon right and and and i had heard you know i was i had heard that you know these you got to be wary of these doctrines and things like that but when you're in that atmosphere and you're not if you're not grounded in the word that one percent will get you it's so easy to get you amen now it's not for us amen to to act like we're better than them or or oh you know it's not that that's not the ad even the attitude that we should have amen amen but but you have to make sure where you are standing in the word amen before you say amen to something right amen you have to know i mean sometimes we just say amen because that's just what we're used to amen amen amen amen and the brother could be up there preaching anything and we're still saying amen because it's the church environment because it's it's it's the pastor saying it or or the preacher that that came for you know from another state to come i mean he's got to be right i mean he's he's well known around the world so we must but you see that's why you know i've i've i've learned amen that it's so important to listen amen right it's so important to listen and that's the reason why teaching is so important you see teaching is so important we need of course the evangelist to come through we need all those the five-fold ministry amen and some of those amen some of those will speak to us more than others amen but when teaching comes in amen usually when teaching somebody's teaching there's no jumping and shouting amen and going on why because we're trying to listen right because it's it's it's see satan was teaching eve right satan was teaching eve he wasn't he wasn't preaching amen he wasn't he actually had her in a chat room talking with her yeah had her in the chat room you know you know you know maybe uh facetiming her facetiming eve and uh you know just just chatting with her and uh or on a zoom call yeah yeah and just look just looking at just and he's teaching her and showing him showing her charts and everything i mean you see but she failed that little one percent that's right that little one percent yeah she she that the 99 he wasn't telling her everything a lie she she just she just fell that little one percent then put this this two and two together right here and it caused her to go to the downfall that we're in now amen so you be careful young people amen in your zoom calls and in your in your in your facetimes and in your facebook lives and all these things amen be careful the slicker could be in there amen oh my slicker is not uh brother brown called him the slicker and he wasn't he wasn't the ugly satan that brother wade has been saying satan is not a two-horned you know a long tail with a pitchfork and nothing like that he doesn't look like he doesn't look like uh uh uh you know some scary thing right no he looks like of somebody that's clean cut nice i mean dress is nice you know has might even have some sunglasses you know got some adidas on i mean he just looks cool man yeah i mean he just he looks like he fits in he always fits in he does it's not that he's he does i mean he fits in he knows how to talk to the girl because he knows how to talk to the guy to be able to amen to go with him or do things you see thinking's a slicker i don't even know how i'm getting to all this amen praise god but you know what i'm speaking about these things and maybe because uh you know proverbs talks about all these things you know but i wanted to delay kind of this foundation amen to show you that this wisdom amen right you have to have eternal wisdom in your life first before you can impart a mirror before that wisdom could come out of you amen has to be that wisdom of god amen praise god and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words so there is a difference between earthly wisdom and heavenly wisdom all right look what brother branham says here in the message wisdom versus faith it's just a little small quote and so the wisdom that i want you to get straightened out on for before we start there is a wisdom of god a wisdom of god is stay with his word amen as simple as that state is his word but satan in his wisdom tried to twist the word so that's the wisdom i'm speaking of and so when brother brown was preaching that wisdom versus faith message he was he was he was speaking about uh kind of like what brother he's been bringing the two spirits you see the wisdom of man the wisdom of god amen versus faith amen praise the lord so there is a wisdom of god and the wisdom of god is stay with his word amen the wise man amen looks and sees the danger ahead amen sees when somebody is meant is off the word the the prudent man you see and takes and and takes note right amen but the simple just keep moving on right and just and just let themselves get hurt and then find themselves in a in a church or something like that right where they're just completely in a mess you see because why we didn't discern the word amen you see we didn't discern what was going forth behind from behind the pulpit we just took it because it made us feel good you see what i'm trying to say so important in this hour amen stay with his word so the word we know what is his word the word is jesus christ amen now if the word is jesus christ then that means this the he's the wisdom of god amen right the word is the wisdom of god amen amen so if you have the word in your soul by the baptism of the holy ghost it will impart wisdom to you amen you see amen praise god and it will lead you amen it will lead you to to not be carried away with all kinds of doctrines and all kinds of things that come come through amen because that word that wisdom amen will lead you amen to discern things properly amen praise god having spiritual wisdom wisdom will lead you to think talk and act wisely amen amen the spirit of god leads us to do those things to think to act to talk wisely and sometimes amen we we think that we have the wisdom of god in our lives the holy spirit which is that wisdom the wisdom of god and sometimes we act and do foolish things that easily you know it's so easy amen that for us to to think that that we are right and and and we're acting foolishly right man and you claiming the wisdom of god in your life or the spirit of god in your life amen the true spirit of god amen will lead you to act wise will lead you to think in a wise manner praise god we'll lead you to talk wisely amen praise god amen so let's talk about solomon here for just a moment solomon we know that was the wisest man that ever lived on earth amen praise god he was he was the uh we know that god he was praying and and god uh in the bible and and god granted him and said ask what you wish and i would give it unto you now see solomon already had form of wisdom in him amen he was wise amen that's why that's why that's why the bible says jesus said to him that hath he will be given more you see but to him the hath not what he has will just be taken away from him you see but solomon had a form of some form of wisdom already enough to say he didn't ask for riches he didn't ask for for a nice uh uh castle or or anything like that he just said lord i want to have the wisdom to be able to lead these people because they are so many to be the the king that i need to be before them and you know what that pleased to god to answer that way just like it pleased jesus christ amen when the seraphim woman came asking him my daughter is so sick and and can you come and heal her and he called her a dog he said th this this bread is not for you gentiles but for the children of of of israel and she replies with one of the best statements i've ever heard because why she wasn't gonna leave there without a blessing she wasn't gonna leave there without getting something from him getting what she wanted and she said lord even the dogs eat from the crumbs off the master's table so in other words whatever benefits that bread has those crumbs come out of that bread and i have i can receive just the same benefit from that bread in other words the ocean and the spoon amen amen amen if you can just give me the spoon lord yeah with that hey man i i'll have the whole ocean that's what she was saying he said he even jesus was was was was uh uh astonished you know at the uh and he said daughter do you know what she said go receive your faith have made you whole or received amen he didn't even have to go right amen he said just go she's going to be fine amen praise god so here solomon was kind of doing the same thing responded responded the same remember hattie wright when when when god told her ask what you will as brother branham told her ask what you want and it'll be given to you she could have asked for a better home her her sister was sick she could have asked for her healing she could ask but she said she she asked for the better thing and that was the salvation of hers of her sons you see she asked for the better thing how many of us would have asked for that how many of us would have or would we have asked for the riches and the better house and the better truck and the better uh you know motorcycle or something if you did then god can't entrust you with with with you see but he could entrust here solomon when he asked for wisdom so the wisdom that he received was from god but watch now it was not enough to give him the new birth so really in a sense it was limited wisdom amen think about that i mean he was the wisest man in the world but it was limited amen we know eventually even with his wisdom the way he the way he ended he made unwise decisions later on with all the wisdom that he had he still made unwise decisions you see when the spirit of christ amen is in the believer amen he will lead you and guide you unto all truth amen and so that's the wisdom that we're talking about amen the wisdom of god amen just give me just a few more minutes amen maybe we might continue this next time yet the rulers the rulers around solomon including the queen of shiva the queen of sheba traveled three months to see about this wisdom and it and it changed her life you know when you read those messages that brother branham preached about the queen of sheba amen she traveled three months to go to church [Laughter] three months to go to church and sometimes we can't travel 30 minutes to a service we can't travel man 15 minutes to go to a service amen she because she wanted to see about this wisdom this wisdom that that man had a man that this man had she wanted to go see it and she received from it amen she received from that wisdom she saw greater things that she had never seen before that's the same thing that's the same attitude amen that we should have whenever we come to the house of god just kind of bringing it down you see right when you come to the house of god amen what attitude do you have when you come to the church amen what attitude do you have about church in general is it just a lodge to you is it just a meeting place to kind of is it a club like you know how the shriners they meet together or how the uh the uh uh you know all these different clubs that they're out there you know is it a club to you or is it life because the word of god which is the wisdom of god which is life which is eternal life is being is is coming forth from this from from this pulpit amen and so do you see it that way or is it just a club amen i'm afraid that some of us kind of see it that way we see it that it's just something that we could just do every now and then or whenever we want to whenever we want to and it doesn't work that way you will not get ahead of in your life amen when you when you see come into church like that that's right right i guarantee you amen you will not get ahead in life amen but when you see coming to church as a priority above anything else worldly amen above anything else there's a blessing in your life amen there's a blessing in your life amen and it will be it will show forth it will show forth amen we can't we can't even hardly travel 30 minutes to come to church sometimes and then we say that we have the spirit of wisdom in us amen see if if solomon's wisdom changed the queen's life how much more now us now with the wisdom of god imparted through us through the baptism of the holy ghost glory amen amen with the wisdom the true wisdom of god you see how much how much can that change our lives and change others as well help change others as well be salty being salty amen i want i want to be more of that sometimes i sometimes we just get so carried away with our own with our own selves and we forget amen where we've come from you see and where and where we need to be so that we can go where we need to go amen praise god i'm just talking to you all amen right now amen praise god praise the lord amen doesn't it make you happy to be part of that eternal life amen to know that you were in him before the foundation of the other world where in his mind but hey hey man i want to be part of that life amen if i give that be be part of that life amen so that life can manifest through me in this hour amen that godly eternal wisdom amen it just depends how how bad you want the spirit amen how bad do you want his spirit right amen to obtain to obtain true wisdom how bad do you want it amen praise god there was a little there was a little story that that i read uh about about and with with this i might finish up or we'll read a last quote here but just kind of it's kind of uh make you uh make you all smile just a little bit or i wouldn't be able to see your smiles but [Laughter] but there's a little funny story that that i read about a a little a young man who went to socrates the the the philosopher i think and was he went to him and he said he said socrates mr socrates i want you to to impart to me wisdom and knowledge and he said it to him with a smile like can you do that so socrates was looking at this boy and he's like man this is chump you know it's a chump he thinks that he could just get wisdom and knowledge just like that he said okay you want wisdom and knowledge all right let's go over here so he takes him over to the sea they live there next to the ocean and he takes them over to the sea they walk to the shore right there and they get into the water about about chest high and so and so socrates says what is it that you want again say i want i want wisdom and knowledge so socrates with his strong hands takes him and takes him puts his hands on his shoulder and just buries him in the water for about 30 seconds counts all the way to 30 and then lets me out and he comes out of the water what is it that you want again i want wisdom so socrates looks at him again and he pushes him down again this time he leaves him down for 40 seconds counts to 40. brings them back up what is it that you want i want knowledge so socrates go okay brings him back down again this time he leaves him in there for 50 seconds amen and he says and then and then after the 50 second he lets him out and he's really breathing really hard what is it that you want i really want knowledge and wisdom and he said if if you really want it that bad if you really want it that bad the way you're you're grasping you're you're gasping for air now amen because what he said was i really want air now that's what he said he said i really want air that's what i want he said the way you want air amen and that's if that's how you really want knowledge and wisdom amen then you'll obtain it then you see the way you need that air amen coming out of the water so the way you want amen the holy ghost to move in your life amen you will be desperate for it exactly right you will not be you know just just you know in your own way you know just doing your own thing thinking that you're going to get by amen you're going to be desperate for it and doing it the right way doing it according to the word seeking for it according to the word and according to the message amen you see that's that's that you want to obtain true wisdom of god amen seek it seek it the way uh the way we we seek other things you see the way we let other things amen take the place of god in our life amen if you could seek god that way you will get very far with god let me read this quote real quick and we'll finish with this and we'll just continue this maybe next time because there's something here i wanted to bring out here in the book of proverbs amen but we'll read we'll read it next time brother adam says here and the the last quote brothers if you want to bring it up and the only way that we can ever live is because we have eternal life this body dies all of our parts die but the part that's eternal is god and cannot die now the word the bible is eternal because it is god in word form and what and what was in god in his thoughts before there was any spoken word it was god amen you see it it was god therefore being predestinated and how are we predestinated by foreknowledge we who are saying we trust and i'm i'm along with you that was predestinated in other words he's saying i was predestinated just like you there in the congregation was the the things that was with god in eternity amen praise god and then if you are born again child of god you are and got the holy spirit in you see if you are a born again child of god you are and got the holy spirit in you are the manifestations of god's spoken word before it was the word before it was a word amen you are the manifestations of god's spoken word before it was a word it has to be a thought before it can be a word in other words you were in those thoughts amen of god in his mind a word is a spoken thought and the thoughts was in god and then we were in god in eternity in that eternal life and we were spoken into existence by the word oh what by what word this word god's word amen praise god this word god's word amen this is the word that spoke you into existence it wasn't a different word this was the word that created you in your mom's belly it wasn't a different word amen and this is the word amen that will come across in your life amen to fulfill that predestination that representation by predestination amen because it that has to be fulfilled when the word comes across your life if you were predestinated in god's foreknowledge amen praise god amen amen so i appreciate god and i hope that you learned something so maybe we'll continue with this i have something further to show but of course time i don't want to keep you all so let's stand to our feet amen i hope i didn't confuse somebody hopefully make makes make things a little clearer and amen glory and that's what we're here to do amen the minister is not here to just you know to to just preach things and and then you you know you just go you try to figure it out yourself you know we try to to try to explain things you know that's what teaching is about you see we try to explain things i'm not a teacher brother dell's a teacher you see because i start goofing off brother dale [Laughter] [Music] i guess that's my part you know but uh but god's good what a great time to be serving god what a what a great hour you know nothing has changed with god nothing has changed with his word the world is falling apart brother branham said and and chaos is is upon our land upon our world but the word still remains the same nothing has changed with the word and if that word remains in you amen if it's in you then you should be you shouldn't even change it either it's sad to see how the conditions of life and the in the externals of life change people and make them make him act different when the word of god never changed and the word of god is that eternal life and that eternal life is in you you should be the same yesterday today and forever just like christ praise god i'm getting ready to preach again brother boy 48 in the black notebook i'll bless your name amen in prisoner's chains with bleeding strides upon inside let's [Music] and in their pace [Music] amen i bless your name i bless your name i give you one gift give you praise oh [Music] the truth i bless your name i bless your name let's sing that last verse brother boy we bless your name [Music] give you praise [Music] we bless your name we bless your name praise the lord jesus amen what a wonderful name to bless in this hour brother dale do you have anything brother wait anything amen all right so remember service this sunday same as we've been doing uh 10 in the morning two in the afternoon amen so we saw more people come this sunday so that was this past sunday so so that was one that was good amen so so uh if you if you're viewing us hey man we miss you and uh the doors are open so you're welcome you know but but obviously you know we respect if you want if you still want to stay at home and when streaming amen but if you're streaming in i mean you can see even in the parking lot you can be in the parking lots as well outside as well exactly hey man but you're welcome hey man you're welcome amen and uh so we love you all and uh continue to pray for us so glad to see sister rachel and brother joe and all of them back amen praise god i know they had a good time and uh i'm sure jonas and sophia they all had a good time too and uh so we just thank god amen for bringing them safe amen being together again i want to see things back again the same way that's why the desire see this place amen and uh you all pray for us because we're trying to uh we're trying to make a decision about about maybe going this this november or december to central america but the things that the brothers are telling me i mean there's still so many restrictions and things i mean there's an invitation that invitation that i have to costa rica that i had from last december and the brother i talked with him the other there and the other day and he said brother he said honestly churches are not even open right now there's there's really i mean if you're going to come and then you're going to you're going to face the all these restrictions and all these different closures and all these different things he said and then if you do come and get through you know through the airport you're just going to be ministering through a zoom through zoom you know he said honestly maybe just re-double think it so i guess that was my answer for the to not go this at least to costa rica but there's still an option there for nicaragua and honduras again nicaragua doesn't have hardly any restrictions whatsoever churches are open there everything is just kind of pretty much the same and so uh there's some things that i would love to be able to help out with them over there but you all pray for me pray for us you know because that's what we would like to be you know to to help out and uh and just be part of that work amen right there but uh god bless you all let's just have a word of prayer before we dismiss our heavenly father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word and we would ask you lord that you would now just help us to take these things father god and lord to just to reveal them to us lord father god impart that wisdom into us father god that only can come from your holy spirit that we may live father god lives lord that are pleasing to you lord bless and protect my brothers and sisters lord and watch over them continue to be with the needs that were mentioned here today and lord you be the one who to guide and protect us bring us back lord sunday father god to receive from your word lord we love you and we appreciate you and we commit these things into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you all may be dismissed well i just want to take a little bit of time and shout glory glory glory lord
