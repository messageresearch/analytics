[22:39] thinking about lordy we hadn't seen in a
[22:41] while since Gene different ones lord

[22:56] and Lord now that they're back together
[22:57] we feel Lord that that we'll be
[23:00] strengthened by what they went through
[23:02] and the experiences they had and the
[23:04] things they had to say thank you for a
[23:07] church that stands behind Lord people
[23:09] that can go to the Foreign Fields and do
[23:12] your work Lord
[23:14] we don't know on this side but on the
[23:16] other side we'll know how much this
[23:19] church has impacted the places in the
[23:22] world the United States even
[23:24] we'll know it on the other side because
[23:26] somebody will walk up to us one day and
[23:28] say hey I got born again when you
[23:30] preached that service right there
[23:32] praise God
[23:34] ten thousand worlds
[23:36] Lord I pray that you'd be with us in
[23:37] affirmative service
[23:39] bless us and lead us guide us by the
[23:40] holy spirit let us sit and listen to you
[23:43] now Lord move me Lord out of the way and
[23:46] you use this vessel
[23:47] for your honor and your glory in Jesus
[23:49] name we pray
[23:51] amen
[23:52] Son of Man part 86 in the beginning was
[23:54] the word and the Word was with God
[23:57] and the Word was God and that word was
[24:00] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[24:01] beheld his glory the glory the only
[24:03] begotten of the father fall
[24:06] somebody say fall fall of Grace and
[24:09] Truth not just part full
[24:11] Genesis 2 9 and out of the ground made
[24:13] the Lord to grow every tree that's
[24:15] Pleasant to the site and good for food
[24:17] now stop there's that little uh whatever
[24:20] that is I can't remember what the
[24:21] semicolon
[24:22] thank you all you that are smarter than
[24:24] me semicolon I was not good in English
[24:27] math tear you up English barely made it
[24:31] so and you can tell it now and but then
[24:34] it says stop because that's trees with
[24:36] roots
[24:38] these two trees that he's fixing to talk
[24:40] about are not that's an allegory or
[24:43] that's a revelation that you've got to
[24:45] have to know that that tree of life is a
[24:48] person
[24:49] that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[24:51] is a person and there's only two people
[24:53] with power and that's God and the devil
[24:55] and devil don't have any power God
[24:57] allows him to have power all right but
[24:59] they are two trees though to make your
[25:01] choice
[25:02] that's where the chores comes from tree
[25:04] of life treating all is good to know
[25:05] there's no other tree that you've got
[25:06] that you live by you either live by the
[25:09] tree of life or the tree of knowledge of
[25:10] Good and Evil so you may be seated in
[25:11] the Lord as blessing
[25:13] to the reading of the word Isaiah 53
[25:15] says yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[25:17] him he hath put him to grief when thou
[25:19] shalt make his soul
[25:21] he gave his soul we're going to talk
[25:22] about that just for a second because I
[25:24] got a little extra Revelation the other
[25:26] day that I want you to to look at it
[25:28] with me uh when we pull the chart up
[25:30] well Thou shalt make his soul an
[25:32] offering for sin
[25:34] why his soul that's the most important
[25:36] part that's the person of God that's the
[25:39] theophany of God that's the Eternal
[25:42] person of God inside of that vessel and
[25:45] if you're born again tonight you've got
[25:46] a piece of that inside of your soul
[25:48] we're soul to soul
[25:51] Faith or doubt that's it Tree of Life
[25:53] tree of knowledge all right
[25:56] he shall see his seed what his progeny
[25:58] are his bride he shall prolong his days
[26:01] in the pleasure of the Lord shall
[26:02] prosper in his hand he shall see the
[26:05] travail of his soul listen Jesus didn't
[26:08] live a nice beautiful perfect life
[26:12] yeah he was perfect but he wasn't
[26:14] perfect around him people hated him
[26:17] because why he was the son of man they
[26:18] never had handled a man like that before
[26:21] they never have what the Bible says
[26:24] never have we heard a man like this
[26:26] before him how many of you can say when
[26:28] you get a revelation doesn't matter what
[26:30] man it comes from you said I've never
[26:32] heard a man speak like that before amen
[26:35] amen I hope you experienced that one day
[26:37] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[26:40] shall be what satisfied
[26:42] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[26:45] servant justify many who us for he shall
[26:48] bear who there our iniquity all right
[26:51] then Jesus said to those Jews which
[26:53] believed on him if you continue
[26:56] see if you continue up the statue of
[26:59] perfect man if you continue up the
[27:01] ladder
[27:03] then you are my disciples indeed because
[27:06] there's many of those which believed on
[27:08] him if you'll read later on they left
[27:10] him
[27:11] a lot of them didn't stay all the way
[27:13] they left him listen when he was at the
[27:16] cross they all left him they didn't
[27:18] understand they got what they got
[27:20] nervous in their in their Spirit realm
[27:22] and they didn't want to get put on that
[27:24] cross
[27:27] I mean it's bold as Peter was he he
[27:29] didn't want to do that he didn't want to
[27:31] go there
[27:33] but he did later
[27:35] so that's the same way you and I got
[27:36] across the bear maybe later but we do
[27:39] have a cross to bear what about a man
[27:41] Peter could stand up and say
[27:44] it's hard it's enough to crucify me
[27:46] straight up but how about upside down
[27:49] have you ever stood on your head upside
[27:50] down for a few minutes yeah don't try it
[27:53] now if you get our age
[27:56] but he was nailed to a cross upside down
[27:58] because he didn't want to be done like
[28:00] his Lord
[28:01] amen so if you continue in my word then
[28:04] are you my disciples indeed listen this
[28:07] is not like we said before this is not a
[28:09] microwave religion
[28:11] this is crock pot
[28:13] slow everything's slow in learning and
[28:16] look and you shall know the truth and
[28:18] the truth shall make you free if you
[28:20] pull that chart up I sure would
[28:21] appreciate it
[28:23] we appreciate everybody in the back
[28:25] working Aaron it is a little can you get
[28:27] us some cool up here please it's hot
[28:29] back there and it's really hot up here
[28:32] while they're getting that chart up I
[28:33] want to ask you a question
[28:35] and your soul when when when God gives
[28:39] you a soul
[28:40] it comes from God right we understand
[28:42] that correct All Souls are mine
[28:46] so think with me here All Souls are mine
[28:49] all right so if all souls are mine then
[28:51] God is the only one that can give you
[28:53] assault now the soul that he gives you
[28:56] is perfect but not eternal
[29:00] that's why all babies go to heaven
[29:02] that's why he'll give you from baby till
[29:04] the age of accountability which is where
[29:06] you know don't do that anymore
[29:09] then you've known right then if you do
[29:11] it then you're a sinner
[29:13] about with me you're a sinner right and
[29:16] then being that that position that
[29:18] you're in then you continue on and and
[29:21] brother Bynum even talks about your your
[29:23] soul becomes black
[29:25] because there's a nature that's attached
[29:27] to that that's like this world it's this
[29:29] it's the devil because you know why you
[29:31] were born in sin shaping an iniquity so
[29:33] you had to come the way you did your
[29:36] soul had to come the way it did lost
[29:38] doomed and on its way to hell as
[29:40] brothers always said take a little bitty
[29:42] beautiful young little sweet darling
[29:44] baby
[29:45] did you eat that cookie cookie all over
[29:47] their face cook it all over their hands
[29:49] cookie all over their shirt nope I
[29:51] didn't do that
[29:52] they're Liars them sweet little babies
[29:54] are liars that's why the Bible tells us
[29:57] to
[29:59] cry at the birth of a child
[30:02] and rejoice at the death of a saint we
[30:06] get it right backwards so the soul
[30:08] inside of that soul is either what now
[30:10] Faith or doubt that's your two trees
[30:13] that's your that's your free moral
[30:15] agency your choice to make in life we
[30:18] don't get anything else we want to nail
[30:20] this down
[30:21] so your soul is at Faith or doubt
[30:24] everybody with me all right then you've
[30:27] got you say well you're doing this all
[30:28] over again and all that listen there's
[30:29] these little extra part I want to throw
[30:31] in here in that Spirit Realm
[30:34] God gives you a spirit
[30:38] everybody with me remember reading the
[30:40] concert now
[30:41] that Soul has favored out
[30:45] so if it's doubtful it's of the devil
[30:48] it's black
[30:50] it'll make you do black things
[30:52] dark things sinful things right
[30:57] now when that unclean spirit's driven
[30:59] out cleaned set aside for service and
[31:03] then what filled up with the Holy Ghost
[31:05] that is God almighty
[31:10] now let me ask you a question
[31:13] you see that outside that Spirit realm
[31:15] is Imagination conscious memory
[31:18] reasoning and affection brother Brown
[31:21] says you do not love
[31:25] with your soul
[31:28] only agape love you don't love your wife
[31:31] because you know what there'd be no
[31:33] divorce come on somebody there'd be no
[31:36] divorce there'd be no fights
[31:39] because when we get over there that's
[31:41] the copy of what we brought here
[31:43] it's gonna go there now if it goes there
[31:45] and you're you're a jerk then you're
[31:47] gonna be a jerk over there I don't think
[31:48] dirt's gonna make it
[31:50] but you understand what I'm saying
[31:53] so the characteristics of your soul is
[31:56] God
[31:57] if you're born again
[32:01] now I want to ask you a question
[32:04] what's holding you accountable
[32:07] right now
[32:11] it's the memory that you have of what
[32:14] you did in the past
[32:18] be quiet listen to what I'm saying
[32:21] because if you'll see this you'll see
[32:22] why your body's spirit and soul how it
[32:24] works together because brother Brown
[32:26] says the soul is the nature of the
[32:28] spirit and people get that all twisted
[32:30] up and convoluted that's this and back
[32:31] in the other the Bible tells us that God
[32:34] had to send us a prophet to what
[32:35] discerned the difference between the
[32:37] soul spirit and body and I know that
[32:39] brother round did that he he was the
[32:41] only one scientists couldn't pull it
[32:43] apart now you can't cut your body in
[32:45] half and that's what it looks like
[32:49] okay there's not a center realm of you
[32:51] it don't look like a tree okay roof seen
[32:54] the inside of a body I'm pretty sure
[32:55] they don't look like that no it's a pile
[32:57] of mess
[32:59] but your soul is your firing mechanism
[33:02] that's what makes you work because when
[33:04] your soul leaves your body you're dead
[33:08] but now what makes your soul
[33:11] untouchable
[33:16] if you're born again what makes your
[33:18] soul untouchable
[33:20] it's God
[33:22] and there's no memory of what you did
[33:24] before
[33:26] how do you guys think we're going to
[33:27] make it
[33:28] to the body change and our soul remember
[33:32] what we did in the past
[33:36] think a little bit
[33:39] brother Brown never said that memories
[33:42] and conscious infection imagination was
[33:44] here he said that was Faith or doubt
[33:46] here is where we think if you're born
[33:49] again right here listen the Bible even
[33:51] tells us we're sending heaven in places
[33:52] that thing is eternal so there's no bad
[33:56] memory
[33:57] in your soul
[33:59] there's no human infection in your soul
[34:04] that's Agape period
[34:10] there's no reasoning
[34:13] your memory's been cut off in your soul
[34:15] because what happens when we take a body
[34:17] change or when we step over in another
[34:19] dimension the Bible says behold all
[34:23] things are made new where's that come
[34:25] from well it's just something God just
[34:26] throw no you got it in you right now
[34:30] we've not we've not known the soul like
[34:33] we should know what that is inside of us
[34:35] that's why I said let that part of you
[34:37] out though we've got it so hugged up in
[34:40] sin and our memory our reasoning our
[34:43] affection our Consciousness our
[34:46] imagination
[34:48] till we're not letting that man inside
[34:50] work
[34:52] but if you're born again that is God
[34:55] that is the PowerHouse I've been telling
[34:57] that's why brother around said he had to
[34:58] come
[34:59] Build Me Up Lord so I can teach others
[35:01] what teach you who's talking to you
[35:05] it's your soul talking to you from the
[35:07] inside
[35:08] and then Satan's talking to you from the
[35:10] spirit Realm
[35:12] then we have knowledge of who that guy
[35:14] is but when you're not born again you
[35:17] have no discernment
[35:20] you have no discernment it's just all
[35:22] together we did what we wanted to do
[35:25] there was no oh yeah that was a little
[35:26] something in there said hey you don't
[35:28] really don't need it you don't need to
[35:28] do that
[35:29] all right
[35:31] but you know what
[35:33] we did it anyway
[35:36] why did why did we do it anyway when we
[35:39] don't do it now
[35:41] the Soul's been changed
[35:44] the soul has been cleaned up the soul is
[35:46] God doesn't make a mistake never did it
[35:49] wrong I was thinking back in that
[35:51] Genesis 1 26 of course you know that's
[35:52] my favorite scripture I love to preach
[35:54] on it that thing that was made there in
[35:57] the beginning was the theophany of God
[36:00] it was the soul of God which is now
[36:03] inside of you by the new birth
[36:05] never did have a beginning never did
[36:06] have an end
[36:08] that's why brother Brown said the new
[36:09] birth is the most important thing that
[36:12] you could ever have
[36:14] is to realize your soul is now God
[36:18] with no memory of your past
[36:22] there's your C
[36:24] of God's forgetfulness
[36:26] now we remember in our spirit Realm it
[36:31] just works I don't know about you works
[36:33] on me all the time
[36:34] but down inside that guy's not
[36:37] remembering the bad things you did it
[36:39] can't if it's God
[36:42] can it there's no way it can
[36:45] there's no way it has a bad memory
[36:47] there's no way I had a bad thought
[36:49] there's no way to imagine stuff
[36:52] oh come on somebody see what I'm talking
[36:54] about see what you got when you got the
[36:56] new birth
[36:57] you got God the perfect part
[37:01] that's why he said be there for perfect
[37:04] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[37:06] that's where you came from
[37:10] everybody with me
[37:13] so the soul there's your remember that's
[37:16] your that's your key
[37:18] faith it out
[37:20] all right
[37:22] but now when you die
[37:26] and you go across the curtain of time
[37:29] all right let's say you're not born
[37:31] again
[37:32] your soul is still there
[37:35] not the sixth Dimension your soul is
[37:37] still here there here here
[37:39] you have the memories and conscious face
[37:41] and Imagination
[37:42] you take what you remember there
[37:46] because you're a sinner
[37:47] you've not been clean you've not been
[37:49] wiped out
[37:50] that's right brother Brown said a sinner
[37:52] is resurrected in the body they send in
[37:55] and we'll have to give an account of
[37:56] what they did
[37:59] but you and I
[38:00] hey I only got to give an account of
[38:03] what he did
[38:04] that's all I got to give a count up
[38:06] brother Danny is what he did I put
[38:08] everything I got on what he did he took
[38:10] my sin he took my shame and he's inside
[38:13] of you tonight so that's what goes to
[38:15] the sixth Dimension and then in that
[38:17] sixth Dimension you don't just have you
[38:19] don't have past memory you have all the
[38:22] memory
[38:24] remember brother Brown comes across the
[38:26] curtain of time
[38:27] his body's still there so he's still got
[38:29] a connection he's not dead
[38:31] he's just moved over into a faster
[38:33] Dimension and it saw with me
[38:37] their memory says if you had not come
[38:41] we would not have been here
[38:43] now where'd that come from that come
[38:45] from what they took over there
[38:48] their soul and their Spirit went over
[38:50] here
[38:51] in a faster dimension
[38:54] and it not only enhanced what you it
[38:57] just made you God all over
[39:01] perfect love is God's love perfect love
[39:05] is Perfect Memory perfect conscious
[39:07] perfect affection oh listen what you got
[39:10] tonight
[39:12] if it's a piece of God it's all of God
[39:18] but we're not complete those people have
[39:21] got to come back and get their body
[39:24] because you're a unit
[39:26] and that unit is not why did why didn't
[39:29] why didn't those people in the curtain
[39:31] of time say well we're fine here brother
[39:33] we don't want to go by it remember he
[39:35] said he didn't want to go back
[39:37] right he said I gotta go get back in
[39:38] that
[39:39] they said yeah you got to go back
[39:43] said but we'll be judged with you
[39:45] we've got to come back to earth with you
[39:49] to get our what to get our mortal bodies
[39:51] because we're human beings
[39:53] we're not fully human here
[39:56] right we're theophany
[39:58] we're eternal
[40:00] but why wouldn't they want to stay if I
[40:01] if you ever got me an eternal state
[40:04] why would you want to go back there
[40:06] what really why would you want to go
[40:08] back but see their Revelation showed
[40:11] them that when they got back over there
[40:13] according to the prophet's message when
[40:15] they got back into their body it became
[40:17] glorified then you don't have to worry
[40:19] about the sin curse anymore you don't
[40:22] have to worry about my Lord I'll be 63
[40:24] tomorrow yeah I know I'm not going to go
[40:26] there
[40:27] everybody wish me happy birthday today I
[40:29] know what y'all doing
[40:31] just in case you forget tomorrow
[40:33] I have a way of reminding you
[40:36] but I've got these little spots that
[40:38] come up
[40:39] that wasn't there three or four years
[40:41] ago
[40:43] all you older ones are laughing younger
[40:44] ones are going what are they talking
[40:46] about
[40:48] I got hair where I don't need it
[40:51] I don't have it where I need it
[40:54] that's because that's because of the sin
[40:57] curse
[40:58] but that's all going to be brother Brown
[41:01] you you're bald-headed he said I
[41:05] got a theophany had not lost one of them
[41:08] that 18 year old kid never lost a hair
[41:15] you love the Lord
[41:17] I mean he'd give us a revelation of Who
[41:19] We Are
[41:20] and what we're doing here and what peace
[41:23] and part of us by knowledge that's why
[41:26] I'm coming to this knowledge part by by
[41:28] knowledge we understand and we can
[41:31] divide rightly divide the word of Truth
[41:34] know that Satan is talking to us only in
[41:36] our spirit realm that God is talking us
[41:38] to those to us though through our Center
[41:41] realm which is the soul
[41:43] man all right
[41:45] Chief which one wins
[41:48] one I feed the most
[41:51] feed the outside man
[41:53] you'll get what the outside man is
[41:56] you feed that inside man if it's born
[41:58] again
[41:59] if it's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:01] that's God talking
[42:04] then brother I'm saying now deity
[42:06] resides in man
[42:09] deity resided in Jesus Christ at one
[42:11] time
[42:12] but now deity resides in The Bride of
[42:15] Jesus Christ that's what the world is
[42:17] not going to ever see and if they
[42:19] thought he was the devil they're going
[42:21] to think you one too because you're not
[42:22] normal
[42:24] you do things different what you think
[42:26] different your control tower is
[42:29] different
[42:33] I think Paul says talk about yielding
[42:35] your members well that's not these
[42:38] they're not yielding these it's yielding
[42:42] those memory reason conscious defection
[42:45] those members
[42:47] you're going to put towards what God's
[42:50] affection
[42:51] not the affection of this world listen
[42:53] this world will love you to hell
[42:56] come on somebody this world will love
[42:59] you to hell
[43:01] I ain't never used one of these before
[43:04] but it well
[43:07] like what a brother said the other day
[43:10] look how close Judas was
[43:13] to the Gates of Heaven
[43:16] he kissed it
[43:20] he literally kissed the Gates of Heaven
[43:22] that's how close he was
[43:24] to heaven
[43:26] he hugged the Lord Jesus and said Jesus
[43:29] said friend
[43:30] would in other words Jim Fran what are
[43:31] you doing and he kissed him
[43:33] that's how close he was to the Gates of
[43:35] Heaven
[43:36] and he wound up in hell
[43:39] same way with me and you
[43:41] how close I don't want to know how close
[43:43] I can get to the gates of hell
[43:46] I want somebody to say enter in
[43:49] praise the Lord
[43:50] made for you when before the foundation
[43:53] of the world before you messed up in
[43:56] your Humanity before you made a mistake
[43:58] in your human being in your human body
[44:00] before all that and then right here I
[44:04] will restore to you the years that all
[44:07] that was beat down
[44:10] Fellowship
[44:12] revelation
[44:14] faith
[44:16] that was eat down folks
[44:18] that was prevalent in the first church
[44:20] age it was okay in the second Church age
[44:23] then he really started eating brother
[44:25] Brown said like at nicaea
[44:27] he eat it down to a stump but he said I
[44:30] will restore you and I are in that part
[44:33] of this not it's not restoring
[44:40] we're not shook
[44:42] this age is not Shock this age is wheat
[44:48] seed
[44:49] what went in the ground sure all that
[44:51] had to come back up life had to come
[44:53] through it but remember when you harvest
[44:56] corn
[44:57] when you harvest that corn
[44:59] that stop dies
[45:01] there's no life in it there's no way it
[45:04] can
[45:05] there's no way it can reproduce itself
[45:07] Michael just went to seed
[45:10] but praise God his seed put in the
[45:12] ground
[45:13] it'll grow something else
[45:16] I will restore to you the years of
[45:18] locusty canker worm caterpillar Palm
[45:21] worm my great Army I sit among you you
[45:23] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[45:26] praise the name of the Lord your God I
[45:28] hope we get to it we're going to talk a
[45:29] little bit about teaching and what
[45:31] teaching does for us if we get to it if
[45:33] we don't we'll do it
[45:34] a couple weeks
[45:36] and praise the name of the Lord that
[45:37] hath dealt wondrously with you
[45:40] and my people shall never be ashamed you
[45:42] should never be ashamed to be a
[45:44] Christian if you're ashamed to be a
[45:45] Christian you ain't one hello
[45:50] well I might
[45:52] might what
[45:54] you might let your light shine and let
[45:57] somebody see it
[45:59] because this world is like really dark
[46:01] if y'all have not noticed that
[46:05] look at all that happened in California
[46:08] a six-year-old kid
[46:10] gets the gun off of Daddy's he should
[46:13] have been well I don't say he shouldn't
[46:14] be shot but the daddy should have never
[46:17] left that there
[46:18] but that six-year-old kid he watches
[46:20] movies he watches video games oh I'm
[46:23] just gonna go to my teacher well she did
[46:27] or he did whichever one I can't remember
[46:29] where we got a little boy I guess six
[46:31] years old
[46:33] six
[46:34] what were you doing at six
[46:37] I couldn't hardly walk
[46:42] and they're picking up guns now
[46:45] and the parents were letting them
[46:48] it's all parental delinquency folks once
[46:50] you see what's going on it is the
[46:52] parent's fault
[46:54] Prophets
[46:56] for man
[46:57] when I took out prayer and they took out
[46:59] the Bible and they took out punishment
[47:01] in the schools look what happened
[47:05] a bunch of a bunch of intellectual
[47:09] idiots
[47:11] when it comes to here when it comes even
[47:13] to the world just to live listen you
[47:15] didn't hear none of that when we were
[47:17] growing up
[47:18] the worst you had was maybe two girls
[47:20] got mad at each other for dating the
[47:22] same boy and they whacked each other
[47:23] around and pulled each other hair and
[47:25] then it was done
[47:26] worst fight I ever seen was two women
[47:28] two girls
[47:31] the Bible said something about a woman's
[47:33] scorn
[47:34] so anyway praise the Lord anyway
[47:37] Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom
[47:40] Shall he make to understand Doctrine
[47:42] who's us them that are weaned from the
[47:44] milk and drawn from the breast no where
[47:47] your soul is
[47:50] I don't mean is
[47:53] with God
[47:56] where your spirit is
[47:58] with God
[48:00] because if your soul is born again one
[48:02] more time you're just as Eternal as God
[48:04] is you've just got a human being
[48:06] attached to it
[48:09] and we have to because we fail because
[48:12] of Eve what happened between even the
[48:14] beast that's where we came from but you
[48:16] know what you can't blame it on Eve now
[48:20] you have the tree of knowledge and the
[48:22] Tree of Life in front of you tonight
[48:23] you're going to eat one or you're going
[48:26] to eat the other one of the two
[48:28] and the Bible said we'll read in just a
[48:31] minute God told them if you eat of that
[48:33] tree you're going to die if you eat of
[48:35] this tree that's why it's called a tree
[48:37] of life
[48:42] and we're heading toward adoption I hope
[48:43] you'll see that
[48:45] that we're not it's not an adoption like
[48:47] you adopt a kid we talked about last
[48:48] week about how you it say a girl can't
[48:51] have a sister can't have a kid and she
[48:54] goes and adopts the kid from a foster
[48:56] home or that's not what this is talking
[48:57] about
[48:58] this in the Bible is talking about
[49:00] taking your own son
[49:03] your own son and seeing how he grows and
[49:06] how he listens to the tutor or the
[49:09] teacher and how good that he obeys his
[49:12] teacher and obeys his parents then God
[49:15] will adopt you into the family of God
[49:17] not adopt you into the family like you
[49:19] never was he's going to give you more
[49:22] power
[49:22] that's what brother Branham really the
[49:25] whole the whole message sums up in one
[49:27] thing he he come to open the book
[49:32] to give us power
[49:34] that we lost in the church ages
[49:36] because of that bug eating everything
[49:38] down we lost it because he shut the door
[49:40] we couldn't get to what we couldn't get
[49:41] to the door
[49:43] I am the door he said to the Sheepfold
[49:47] all right let's look at this real quick
[49:48] knowledge
[49:49] add to Virtue knowledge
[49:52] no cease which is science knowledge I
[49:55] want to read this one right here we've
[49:56] been reading it before but such as
[49:57] belongs to the more advanced
[49:59] you say well I don't know anything
[50:02] an excuse
[50:05] listen
[50:07] God does not mind that you didn't go
[50:11] through the seventh grade sixth grade
[50:12] 10th grade
[50:14] brother Brown was seventh grade
[50:17] but he was an intellectual Einstein as
[50:19] far as the scripture he was an
[50:21] intellectual Einstein he was a
[50:22] supernatural Einstein that could look
[50:25] into the mind of God where where
[50:27] Einstein with his own human brain that I
[50:29] would assume I'm not trying to put him
[50:31] to hell but if he didn't get born again
[50:33] that's where he's ending up he could be
[50:35] the smartest man in the world give us
[50:36] all kind of Technology
[50:38] if you're not born again doesn't matter
[50:40] about all that
[50:41] but such as belong to the more advanced
[50:43] especially if things lawful and unlawful
[50:45] for Christians
[50:47] moral wisdom such as seen in right
[50:49] living
[50:51] then Genesis 2 9 we talked about this
[50:53] again out of the ground made the Lord to
[50:55] grow every tree the Tree of Life
[50:58] where
[51:00] in the midst of the garden
[51:02] the Bible says in the midst of the
[51:04] paradises of God in the midst and
[51:11] [Music]
[51:15] completely crazy
[51:17] and be born again in your soul you can
[51:20] let a demon get on you and you can do
[51:22] things that you really didn't want
[51:24] anyone come on somebody
[51:26] look at that preacher
[51:28] brother Brown said he was a believer
[51:30] he was a preacher of the gospel for his
[51:33] time
[51:34] he said I ain't preaching no more he got
[51:36] a spirit on him and that Spirit drove
[51:38] him to drinking well God just went ahead
[51:40] and just took him on home his life got
[51:41] real short at that point in time
[51:43] because he couldn't get that thing off
[51:45] of him
[51:46] we need to get that off of us
[51:49] not that drinking Spirit but any Spirit
[51:51] we got attached to us it's in that
[51:53] Spirit Realm
[51:54] and it's it's trying to affect your soul
[51:57] it can't move your soul it can't take
[51:59] your soul away from you
[52:00] but it can affect it that's what these
[52:03] that's what these virtues do because
[52:05] remember they would come the Satan would
[52:07] come to Jesus it is written
[52:10] he had knowledge to tell him the right
[52:12] thing at the right time
[52:14] look at the Pharisees they give him all
[52:16] this all these questions and he said let
[52:19] me ask you one
[52:21] did David say when he said to the Lord
[52:23] and said unto my Lord is he talking to
[52:24] this Lord of that Lord
[52:26] what the Bible tell you
[52:28] they never ask you another question
[52:29] after that why it confounded them by the
[52:33] knowledge of God that was in that man
[52:34] that same knowledge can be in you that's
[52:37] why we can confound the scholars that's
[52:39] why we can confound the people of this
[52:42] world that thinks that we're you know
[52:44] we're we're so bound and we're so do's
[52:47] and don'ts and we got to do this and we
[52:48] got no
[52:52] they just don't understand they're the
[52:53] most bound people
[52:55] we are free in Liberty in Jesus Christ
[52:58] and they are so Bound by the devil until
[53:01] they don't realize it
[53:04] now lest he put forth his hand now the
[53:06] Lord drove him out of the garden
[53:08] because if he had left them in the
[53:09] garden they'd become one of us knowing
[53:11] all tree of life and eat and live
[53:13] forever so they had to drive him out
[53:15] and where'd they drive it to they drove
[53:17] us out of the Garden of Eden so we could
[53:19] be born of a man but then what happened
[53:21] when Jesus came Jesus said I am the way
[53:23] the truth of the life to go back to the
[53:25] Garden of Eden
[53:26] right brother Brown said the threefold
[53:28] purpose of God was what all God was he
[53:29] poured into Christ Christ in the church
[53:31] and do what take her back to the Garden
[53:35] of Eden because in Revelations 20 or 21
[53:37] or 22 we see this tree of life pop back
[53:40] up in the new city
[53:42] and it is a tree then
[53:44] that we take the leaves off the Nations
[53:46] and they go outside and do all the
[53:48] things but that tree of life is me and
[53:50] you
[53:52] and the world is eating off of that
[53:55] how do you think people listen the seed
[53:59] life comes to the body even and lies
[54:01] even Paul the great prophet had to go to
[54:05] ananas and and nice pray for him to get
[54:07] the Holy Ghost
[54:09] why didn't he just say oh it just that
[54:11] thing just came alive inside of me and
[54:13] I'm I'm good to go no God said you're
[54:17] not going to see for about three days
[54:18] I'm gonna blind you naturally
[54:21] you're going to need some help it's all
[54:23] because you didn't think you needed any
[54:25] help for that
[54:27] sent him to a place and sent ananias to
[54:30] pray for him
[54:31] to get the Holy Ghost and the scales
[54:33] come off of his eyes
[54:35] a prophet of God yeah a proper to God
[54:38] Prophet at one time was lost
[54:44] we good
[54:46] I want to read you something I got in a
[54:49] um
[54:50] texted me today
[54:53] let me read you this quote let me tell
[54:55] you how
[54:56] how much knowledge people have
[55:01] direct quote
[55:03] from headquarters
[55:05] the bride is making herself ready by
[55:08] pressing play
[55:11] direct quote
[55:14] the bride is making herself ready by
[55:17] pressing play
[55:21] my knowledge doesn't go with that that
[55:24] don't ring a bell I can't shout about
[55:26] that that actually makes me really
[55:28] really sad is how many people are
[55:31] falling for that
[55:34] you might get born again under that but
[55:36] you're not stay Born Again under that I
[55:37] promise you that
[55:39] you won't grow I promise you that
[55:42] because without a Firefall Ministry you
[55:44] can't grow that's why the Bible when you
[55:46] take knowledge and teaching they go
[55:48] together
[55:49] all right without teaching there's no
[55:50] knowledge
[55:52] and you have no knowledge if you don't
[55:53] if you're not taught but am I with me
[55:56] all right I can get it on my own
[55:59] please try
[56:03] that's why
[56:05] we're a congregation we're sheep we need
[56:07] Shepherd we need somebody to run the
[56:10] thing we we're just that way I'm sorry
[56:12] that's what God Said
[56:14] and the Lord God look commanded the man
[56:16] saying of every tree of the garden
[56:17] you'll eat freely but of the tree of the
[56:18] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[56:21] not eat of it for in the day you eat
[56:22] thereof thou the day thou surely shall
[56:25] die man-made gunpowder so we can deer
[56:28] hunt with it also kills about 25 or a
[56:31] million people all over the world every
[56:33] year
[56:36] cars are the biggest killer in the
[56:38] United States there is
[56:40] and we made them
[56:42] not counting cigarettes and beer and all
[56:45] that other stuff that kills us
[56:47] everybody with me
[56:49] all right knowledge
[56:51] my knowledge my man's knowledge we die
[56:55] but we eat off that tree of life and
[56:57] just say God you said you'd feed me
[56:59] you said you'd do this for me
[57:02] you said oh that's kind of bold no
[57:04] that's not bold enough he said come
[57:06] boldly to the throne of grace ask what
[57:08] you will brother Brown said ask for big
[57:10] things
[57:12] well I don't know about that I I that's
[57:14] one thing gets under my skin is somebody
[57:16] tries to be humble that's not
[57:27] but y'all got to listen to me today
[57:31] press play under the angel of Church of
[57:34] Ephesus right these things saith who
[57:35] hold us the seven spiers in his right
[57:37] hand who walks Us in the midst of seven
[57:39] golden candlesticks I Know Thy works
[57:42] and labor in thy patience look look how
[57:45] the holy spirit is going through the
[57:47] church
[57:48] in the first church age Ephesus he's
[57:50] going through the church and he's
[57:51] Discerning what they're seeing and what
[57:54] they're not seeing ain't that what's
[57:55] happening now
[57:57] he's a discerner of the thoughts and
[57:59] intents of the heart
[58:00] I Know Thy Works in thy labor and thy
[58:02] patience and how thou cast not bear them
[58:04] which are evil and thou has tried them
[58:07] which say they are Apostles and are not
[58:08] and has found them liars and that's born
[58:10] as patience for my name's sake has
[58:12] labored and has not fainted nevertheless
[58:16] here we go to the human part
[58:19] here we go to the spirit Realm
[58:21] we know they were born again in the in
[58:23] the first church age amen there was a
[58:25] born-again powerful group of people but
[58:28] they fell from their first love
[58:30] they fell away from the love that they
[58:33] had in the beginning nevertheless I have
[58:35] somewhat against it because thou has to
[58:37] left thy First Love remember therefore
[58:40] from which thou are falling and repent
[58:43] and do the first words or else I will
[58:46] come quickly and remove your Candlestick
[58:49] out of its place except thou repent but
[58:54] their style has that thou haters to
[58:55] Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[58:59] hate us the Deeds of Nicholas God hates
[59:01] you after he just said he did
[59:03] God hates those deeds he hates for the
[59:06] laity to be conquered by one head person
[59:11] I'm reading the Bible you can argue with
[59:13] it if you want to
[59:17] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[59:19] the spirit says to the church now listen
[59:20] that's not your natural ear that's not
[59:22] that
[59:24] well there's a ear up here somewhere I
[59:26] thought there was seed field
[59:27] up here I think yeah right there that's
[59:30] not that ear right there thank you
[59:31] brother Joe that's not that ear right
[59:33] there
[59:34] you can sit here and listen to the
[59:35] message for 50 years and die and go to
[59:37] hell
[59:38] but if you'll ever hear what the spirit
[59:40] says to you
[59:41] you'll not die you'll go to heaven
[59:45] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[59:48] the spirit saith to the church to him
[59:49] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[59:51] the tree of life was in the midst of the
[59:53] paradise of God
[59:55] here we go teach it Whom Shall he teach
[59:57] knowledge that's what we were saying a
[59:59] minute ago and Whom Shall he make
[1:00:01] understand Doctrine them that are weaned
[1:00:03] from the milk and drawn from the breast
[1:00:05] I know that I I know I know I know for a
[1:00:09] fact from the 20-something years I've
[1:00:10] been back
[1:00:12] um serving the lord
[1:00:13] that you see people that just struggle
[1:00:15] over the little stuff
[1:00:18] the little stuff but the Bible said it's
[1:00:21] the little foxes
[1:00:23] listen just like I stumbled just now it
[1:00:26] was that little leg I wasn't looking at
[1:00:28] that stumbled me if it hadn't been a big
[1:00:30] brick there I'd have probably seen it I
[1:00:32] said probably
[1:00:34] but you see what I mean that's why I
[1:00:35] stumbled over because I didn't see it
[1:00:37] how many times you've been walking in
[1:00:39] the yard and you stumbled over a rock
[1:00:40] and it didn't stick up but about that
[1:00:41] high thank you brother all the time you
[1:00:43] need to be careful
[1:00:45] Lord of Mercy brother get you a cane or
[1:00:47] something
[1:00:48] but that's what you stumble over
[1:00:51] you still
[1:00:52] if you see a
[1:00:58] girl that's what we're looking at now
[1:00:59] everybody's got to start small though
[1:01:01] everybody's going to get those little
[1:01:02] things out of the way all of us do
[1:01:06] we need to be wise in God not wise in
[1:01:08] the world
[1:01:10] knowledge the fact or condition of
[1:01:12] knowing something with familiarity do
[1:01:15] you is there is this message familiar to
[1:01:18] you
[1:01:19] but now I ask you another question
[1:01:21] can you live it
[1:01:24] it can be familiar
[1:01:25] I've seen a lot of people
[1:01:28] know the message read the message
[1:01:32] and they walk out that door and their
[1:01:33] hair is just straight across and your
[1:01:36] hair don't usually grow that way
[1:01:38] ain't it happening so don't fool me and
[1:01:40] don't fool God all right
[1:01:44] don't take this armor to see stuff like
[1:01:46] that
[1:01:47] but we're familiar look with something
[1:01:50] with familiarity gained what through
[1:01:52] experience
[1:01:54] our association
[1:01:56] I come to this church because I believe
[1:01:57] it's preaching the truth
[1:01:59] not just me everybody all the all the
[1:02:01] ministry we have here is preaching the
[1:02:03] truth amen that's why I come here
[1:02:06] and that tells me I'm going to associate
[1:02:08] with this group of people I'm not going
[1:02:10] to associate with that group now I I'm
[1:02:12] going to go out there
[1:02:13] I got to go in the world and let your
[1:02:15] light shine but I'm not going to say
[1:02:16] well well now what did Brother Brown say
[1:02:18] one time he said he said don't you let
[1:02:20] some little Ricky
[1:02:22] tell you you go to my church one Sunday
[1:02:24] and I'll go to your church next Sunday
[1:02:26] I'm quoting brother Branham he said
[1:02:29] don't you do that you're on the Devil's
[1:02:31] Ground
[1:02:32] now how many I've heard people in the
[1:02:34] message well I think I'll just go over
[1:02:35] here for a little while let my light
[1:02:36] shine yeah buddy
[1:02:39] you didn't see them no more either I
[1:02:40] must either got put out
[1:02:42] or something happen
[1:02:46] but I can walk
[1:02:49] I feel if you're a mature Christian you
[1:02:53] can walk into a Baptist Church and sit
[1:02:54] there when they're having a meeting get
[1:02:56] something out of it but let your light
[1:02:57] shine and not get caught up in it
[1:03:00] now I want to ask you a question though
[1:03:02] can you go to another message Church
[1:03:04] and discern what they're preaching and
[1:03:06] be able to sit there and fellowship with
[1:03:08] them
[1:03:11] that's a question I ask you
[1:03:15] the circumstance or condition of what
[1:03:17] apprehending truth
[1:03:19] go get truth apprehending truth or fact
[1:03:22] through reasoning come let us reason
[1:03:24] together John 8 4 8 31 says then then
[1:03:29] said Jesus to those Jews which we
[1:03:30] already read this but I'm gonna give you
[1:03:32] the no part if you continue my word then
[1:03:36] you are my disciples indeed and you
[1:03:38] shall know the truth
[1:03:39] not know of it
[1:03:42] listen
[1:03:43] zillions of people's read this Bible
[1:03:46] but there's only going to be a small
[1:03:48] group of people that really knows what
[1:03:49] it says amen all right and you shall
[1:03:52] know the truth
[1:03:54] and the truth shall make you free now
[1:03:56] listen if we know the truth and it's in
[1:03:58] the Bible what's written in the Bible if
[1:04:00] we know that's truth and we do it then
[1:04:03] it promised us to set us free
[1:04:05] not bind us set us free
[1:04:08] and that word no means to perceive or
[1:04:11] understand get a knowledge of feel
[1:04:14] understand perceive have knowledge you
[1:04:16] have to understand it's a Jewish idiom
[1:04:18] for sexual intercourse between a man and
[1:04:20] a woman
[1:04:21] a woman knows a man I know no man she
[1:04:23] said
[1:04:25] Jesus said depart from me I never knew
[1:04:27] you that word knew is exactly right
[1:04:30] there I never had a personal
[1:04:31] relationship now Jesus Christ does not
[1:04:34] have nothing to do with sex act so so
[1:04:35] for those that are new I want you to
[1:04:38] understand one thing that is a that is
[1:04:40] an example that the Lord does Make Love
[1:04:42] To Us
[1:04:44] through agape love not filial love
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:49] and it's not in the womb anywhere else
[1:04:52] but in mind your mind the womb of our
[1:04:54] mind is where we have our relationship
[1:04:57] with Jesus Christ with the control tower
[1:05:00] is where we have that relationship to
[1:05:02] become acquainted with to know to the
[1:05:05] Greeks it's meant to know facts but
[1:05:07] these facts may or may not affect one's
[1:05:09] conduct now this one will
[1:05:12] the one I know the person I know
[1:05:16] it will impact my conduct
[1:05:19] or affect my conduct
[1:05:21] to the Jew true knowledge always
[1:05:23] manifested itself in one's conduct
[1:05:27] one did not know something until that
[1:05:29] fact had a
[1:05:32] practical
[1:05:33] out working in his life
[1:05:36] Proverbs 3 verse 13 says happy is the
[1:05:38] man that findeth wisdom and the man that
[1:05:41] geteth understanding for the merchandise
[1:05:42] of it is better than the merchandise of
[1:05:45] silver
[1:05:46] and the gain therefore then find gold
[1:05:50] wow now see that's totally opposite
[1:05:53] we're we we would I'm sorry we're humans
[1:05:56] if it says silver and gold
[1:05:59] we'd want it
[1:06:04] just go ahead and I'm gonna just say it
[1:06:05] for you yeah
[1:06:08] the Bible says to try for wisdom and
[1:06:11] understanding
[1:06:13] and it will be greater or better than
[1:06:16] having silver and gold in your hand
[1:06:17] because you know what with wisdom and
[1:06:20] understanding of God you can't go to
[1:06:22] hell but with a handful of silver and a
[1:06:24] handful of gold you can right and you
[1:06:26] will
[1:06:27] remember the Rich Young Ruler he said I
[1:06:29] lived all Ten Commandments Lord
[1:06:31] and in another place I Built Barns
[1:06:33] because I didn't have enough Barns and I
[1:06:35] put stuff over here and I put stuff over
[1:06:36] here
[1:06:37] where'd he end up
[1:06:40] in hell
[1:06:42] she she is more precious now now you see
[1:06:44] what you see what the writer is telling
[1:06:47] us in Proverbs we know it's Solomon he
[1:06:50] takes that wisdom to understanding and
[1:06:51] makes it into a she
[1:06:54] now who is she she's him she's the bride
[1:06:57] she is more precious the bride is more
[1:06:59] precious than rubies
[1:07:00] and all the things thou cast desire not
[1:07:03] to be compared to this bride
[1:07:06] Length of days is in her right hand and
[1:07:08] her left hand riches an honor
[1:07:10] her ways are ways of pleasantness and
[1:07:12] all her pastor peace
[1:07:14] she is a tree of life
[1:07:16] what a promise she is a tree of life to
[1:07:19] them that lay hold upon her and happy as
[1:07:22] everyone that retaineth her
[1:07:23] Philippians 1 9.
[1:07:26] you know I read that scripture and I
[1:07:27] think you remember when when the the ark
[1:07:30] was stolen and the Philistines took it
[1:07:32] and put it over in their
[1:07:34] um
[1:07:35] Tabernacle or whatever you want to call
[1:07:36] it Dagon or whatever it was they put the
[1:07:38] thing there and the next day they come
[1:07:40] back and Dagon was you know knocked down
[1:07:42] on the ground and they picked that great
[1:07:43] big statue up they say well maybe
[1:07:45] somebody knocked it over or maybe a mule
[1:07:47] come through here or a bull and they
[1:07:49] pushed it up well after about the third
[1:07:51] time they you know what they do what
[1:07:53] they say get this thing out of here
[1:07:56] get this thing out of here
[1:07:59] and that's what people
[1:08:01] you'll do to people
[1:08:05] right
[1:08:06] remember my little thing that brother
[1:08:08] dick gave me
[1:08:10] my spirit irritates your demons
[1:08:14] only brother dick could come up with
[1:08:15] that
[1:08:16] and this I practice your love may abound
[1:08:20] age and then what all judgment and then
[1:08:22] we come to Corinthians we talked about
[1:08:24] it Sunday where the Saints will judge
[1:08:26] the world
[1:08:27] and then the Saints will judge Angels
[1:08:29] how much more are things that pertaining
[1:08:31] to this life we shouldn't have to go
[1:08:33] outside these walls to settle a legal
[1:08:36] dispute between two brothers or two
[1:08:38] sisters or whatever we you know
[1:08:41] it should be done right here we should
[1:08:43] be able to be able to judge that
[1:08:45] if then you have Judgment of things
[1:08:47] pertaining to this life set them to
[1:08:49] judge who are at least sustained in
[1:08:50] church he's even telling Paul said look
[1:08:52] don't let the don't let the guy that you
[1:08:55] know don't let the deacon do it
[1:08:57] take it to the guy that don't know much
[1:08:59] just start it and let him do it that's
[1:09:01] what he says right here set them to
[1:09:03] judge who are least esteemed in the
[1:09:05] church
[1:09:07] wow
[1:09:08] that's putting God on display is what
[1:09:10] it's doing
[1:09:11] God's proven who he is if you've got a
[1:09:14] born-again Christian he's proven who he
[1:09:16] is
[1:09:17] brother Brown said knowledge now that
[1:09:19] don't mean worldly knowledge because
[1:09:20] that's foolishness to God but knowledge
[1:09:21] to judge everything has to do with judge
[1:09:24] with judging all right
[1:09:27] but when you can see the scripture is
[1:09:29] not contradictory that you can say that
[1:09:32] and conceive by the revelation of God
[1:09:34] the whole word is wrote in Mysteries and
[1:09:36] only the knowledge of God can reveal it
[1:09:38] that's why the Bible says you can't
[1:09:39] understand who Jesus Christ is without
[1:09:41] the Holy Ghost
[1:09:43] because that's that guy in your control
[1:09:44] tower that's gonna what he's going to
[1:09:46] bring you back
[1:09:48] to that Center to that tie post
[1:09:51] because listen we fail every day we
[1:09:53] backslide we go out brother white
[1:09:55] brother Brown Say
[1:09:56] the only way Satan can get to you is
[1:09:58] what
[1:09:59] you go out to his ground
[1:10:02] you stay hid behind the word of God he
[1:10:04] can't get to you
[1:10:08] let's try that sometime
[1:10:12] really we we've come to a place let's
[1:10:13] think about this
[1:10:14] the other day we've come to a place that
[1:10:18] and we do have a lot of knowledge and we
[1:10:20] do have a lot of and it has to be head
[1:10:22] knowledge first all right it's got to
[1:10:24] come ahead of knowledge first all right
[1:10:26] you got to run it through the filter you
[1:10:27] got to run it through the gray matter
[1:10:28] you got to run it through all them
[1:10:29] firing mechanisms and all that stuff
[1:10:31] that's going off you know and stuff
[1:10:33] putting over here and moving over here
[1:10:34] you got to remember what God Said in the
[1:10:36] word of God you got to be able to see it
[1:10:39] um
[1:10:40] but to discern we'll talk about in just
[1:10:42] a minute to discern a Christian is just
[1:10:46] born again not more than you know a
[1:10:49] month or two
[1:10:50] they start discerning
[1:10:55] from the spirit
[1:10:57] and the soul
[1:11:00] because what happens is you've got it
[1:11:03] all together
[1:11:04] then what happens is the word is a
[1:11:06] discerner of the thoughts and Tents of
[1:11:08] the intents of the heart
[1:11:10] it starts pulling it apart
[1:11:13] and were you never in your life
[1:11:16] thought things
[1:11:18] so different
[1:11:21] you're at awe
[1:11:23] when God gives you a revelation how many
[1:11:26] how many of you were trinitarians before
[1:11:27] you came to the message
[1:11:29] okay
[1:11:32] he was almost
[1:11:35] well sister Anna was so
[1:11:37] sorry you're not now I said was was is a
[1:11:41] good word
[1:11:42] she was
[1:11:43] but you had that ingrained in your
[1:11:47] Spirit Realm
[1:11:50] and if you weren't born again at the
[1:11:51] time your soul was happy with that
[1:11:54] I was happy to sit in the Baptist Church
[1:11:57] I was happy to sit in the Presbyterian
[1:11:58] Church I was happy to sit in my own
[1:12:00] church
[1:12:01] most of the time that's where I was the
[1:12:03] Churchill weighed down
[1:12:06] well praise God I'm just the only one
[1:12:07] that's been the center of my life I
[1:12:09] guess
[1:12:12] but the knowledge of God reveals
[1:12:15] starts pulling that thing apart don't
[1:12:17] you remember the day when you first saw
[1:12:18] water baptism
[1:12:20] when you first saw there was no eternal
[1:12:22] hell when you first saw there was one
[1:12:24] God not three
[1:12:26] when you saw that
[1:12:29] now what did you have in your mind
[1:12:31] before in your human mind in the spirit
[1:12:33] realm you had this three gods
[1:12:37] right
[1:12:40] but
[1:12:42] when God revealed it to you
[1:12:44] it took that part of your memory listen
[1:12:46] you can still remember why you were in
[1:12:49] the Baptist Church
[1:12:51] and I still remember the things I did
[1:12:53] and all the uh in the world and all that
[1:12:56] but it's beginning to dull
[1:13:00] it's beginning to dull away
[1:13:03] time is beginning to move
[1:13:05] I think by the word of Lord of the Lord
[1:13:07] too it's it's starting to wash us
[1:13:10] because we're supposed to be washed by
[1:13:11] the word of the word we're supposed to
[1:13:13] have the mind of Christ and we're
[1:13:14] supposed to be yeah we can't help the
[1:13:17] thoughts come but we can what not let it
[1:13:18] Nest well we used to let it Nest we used
[1:13:21] to let build a condominium
[1:13:23] everybody with me well I mean it built
[1:13:25] condominium had flowers and trees and
[1:13:28] all that stuff yeah that's how our yeah
[1:13:30] that's how them thoughts were but now
[1:13:32] they come as a breeze and they blow away
[1:13:35] you say a sinner can't see that a center
[1:13:37] cannot you couldn't fathom that when
[1:13:39] somebody was doing top fire bush bless
[1:13:42] his heart
[1:13:44] he'd say boy
[1:13:47] Jenny you know who you he said boy
[1:13:51] we waiting on you
[1:13:53] I ain't going if you're not going and I
[1:13:56] can't go till you go he said so hurry up
[1:13:59] well you know what that didn't to me
[1:14:01] that just went
[1:14:04] after a while I mean the impact of his
[1:14:06] great big hand doing that and point that
[1:14:08] finger about that big around at you
[1:14:11] foreign
[1:14:12] that was an impact but after a while
[1:14:14] though Jenny it was like you know weeks
[1:14:16] or so later I just went right back it
[1:14:17] didn't bother me and you know it just
[1:14:22] but he did that one time
[1:14:25] when I was born again
[1:14:28] had a different impact
[1:14:31] my firing mechanism had changed a little
[1:14:34] bit
[1:14:35] my spiritual eye had been opened my
[1:14:37] spiritual ear had been opened to know
[1:14:39] that that was God been speaking to me
[1:14:40] the whole time through that man
[1:14:42] the whole time speaking to me through
[1:14:45] that person but it took what the eyes of
[1:14:48] our understanding have been what
[1:14:50] enlightened
[1:14:51] so that we can understand these things
[1:14:53] now brother Brown said look then when
[1:14:54] you get and say and punctuate every word
[1:14:57] of God with an amen then add that to
[1:14:59] your faith then here's the prayer I love
[1:15:02] this prayer Build Me Up O Lord into this
[1:15:03] let Christ be my head that works through
[1:15:06] me on my Foundation my faith is in him
[1:15:08] let virtue in all his temper's places
[1:15:10] Godless brotherly kind of working Me O
[1:15:12] Lord is my prayer I don't care live or
[1:15:14] die how many you can say that live or
[1:15:15] die sneak or Swim I'm gonna make a
[1:15:17] rapture
[1:15:18] man I don't care you're not gonna stop
[1:15:21] me there ain't nobody gonna stop me but
[1:15:22] me
[1:15:25] so then what you know look if look if
[1:15:28] nobody can stop me but me
[1:15:30] where's the devil in that picture
[1:15:36] for God has set in a church apostle
[1:15:39] Paul Angeles to press play all for the
[1:15:42] Lord all for the perfecting and bringing
[1:15:44] all this prayer now that was quoted by
[1:15:46] their higher up that was quoted by their
[1:15:48] number one guy
[1:15:50] okay so we'll just leave them alone but
[1:15:53] I'm going to tell you something
[1:15:58] that's of the devil
[1:16:02] you can't do that and stay in the word
[1:16:04] of God you can't you just pray for them
[1:16:06] and just you leave them people alone
[1:16:09] all right
[1:16:10] each one of these stones are Material
[1:16:12] off of that one this is Material off of
[1:16:15] this each one of these virtues belong
[1:16:16] into him and they're pouring out of him
[1:16:18] where and do you
[1:16:21] down through them 70 weeks of Daniel I
[1:16:23] love this and I and I've been uh
[1:16:26] honing in on this Spirit of wisdom
[1:16:30] because it takes the spirit of wisdom to
[1:16:31] do all kinds of things
[1:16:32] takes the spirit of wisdom to get a
[1:16:34] sermon that that y'all won't
[1:16:37] it's not the one I want one y'all want
[1:16:40] you operate the gift you make the gift
[1:16:42] work I don't you do
[1:16:45] so the spirit of wisdom comes look it
[1:16:47] didn't say it comes into the preacher
[1:16:50] it said comes into the church
[1:16:52] to make known to the church or the bride
[1:16:55] by the revelation of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:56] bringing the church in and revealing
[1:16:59] what they were living in
[1:17:01] just the same as Gabriel came to Daniel
[1:17:03] the Holy Spirit comes to the what comes
[1:17:05] to the church
[1:17:06] in the last days to reveal these great
[1:17:08] deep secret things praise God
[1:17:12] we can understand them if you want to
[1:17:15] because when we say deep
[1:17:18] people just go
[1:17:21] don't do that
[1:17:22] don't do that when we say deep God told
[1:17:25] us
[1:17:26] through a prophet and in the Bible it
[1:17:28] even tells us that we can know even the
[1:17:30] Deep things of God
[1:17:32] because the Deep things of God is so
[1:17:34] shallow if you're a Christian
[1:17:36] if you'll get taught if you'll learn if
[1:17:38] you'll sit and do what God Said to do
[1:17:43] remember to get these virtues is one
[1:17:45] thing that's doing what God Said do be
[1:17:47] an obedience to what God Said to do
[1:17:49] right there shall come forth it Rod out
[1:17:51] of the stem of Jesse talking about Jesus
[1:17:53] Christ and the spirit of the Lord shall
[1:17:55] rest upon Him Spirit of wisdom and
[1:17:57] understanding in the spirit of counsel
[1:17:59] that's why that spirit's come back into
[1:18:01] the church to get us out of here
[1:18:03] you know what Spirit of wisdom we have
[1:18:05] now we have the spirit of wisdom of the
[1:18:07] son of man
[1:18:08] we don't have partial truth
[1:18:11] we have full truth
[1:18:13] we don't have to worry about being right
[1:18:15] or wrong I hope you all know that if
[1:18:17] you're sitting here today worried
[1:18:18] whether this is the right message or the
[1:18:20] wrong message
[1:18:22] go go find you a tree somewhere and get
[1:18:25] under it and stay there until God brings
[1:18:27] you a revelation
[1:18:30] because there's nothing like this
[1:18:32] message of the hour nothing
[1:18:35] it lights you up
[1:18:38] it'll turn your refrigerator into a
[1:18:41] stove
[1:18:43] some of y'all still got icicles
[1:18:45] let the god of our Lord Jesus the father
[1:18:47] of Glory may give unto you the spirit of
[1:18:49] wisdom
[1:18:53] for him the eyes are look there here it
[1:18:55] is the eyes of your understanding yours
[1:18:58] being enlightened
[1:18:59] that you may know what is that word know
[1:19:02] that you may have an intimate
[1:19:03] relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:19:06] what is the hope of his calling what the
[1:19:07] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:19:09] in the Saints I'm not going to get
[1:19:10] finished so I'm going to skip through
[1:19:11] just close your eyes because some of
[1:19:13] these people may make you sick when I
[1:19:15] start scrolling
[1:19:16] there's nothing of such prevailing power
[1:19:19] is a revelation of the word of God
[1:19:21] listen we want power in this church get
[1:19:24] a revelation of the word of God
[1:19:26] get a revelation of where you at give a
[1:19:28] revelation get a revelation of why
[1:19:29] you're doing here why are you here why
[1:19:31] are we here why are in the things we're
[1:19:32] doing why are you doing this why are we
[1:19:34] doing that
[1:19:35] there's nothing of such what is
[1:19:38] prevailing power now you can have power
[1:19:41] but what is prevailing power
[1:19:43] see you can have a lightning bolt and
[1:19:45] that's power but prevailing power is
[1:19:49] this is prevailing power
[1:19:53] as long as you keep them up
[1:19:56] that power will prevail over everything
[1:19:58] else
[1:19:59] and stay on
[1:20:01] so listen let's get our switch flipped
[1:20:06] right that's already
[1:20:08] the power's running through them lines
[1:20:10] right now
[1:20:11] it's just not got the right connection
[1:20:12] yet and you know where it's at it's not
[1:20:14] back there
[1:20:15] it's right here
[1:20:17] right here this is where it's at watch
[1:20:19] oh look at there
[1:20:22] that's why God wants to make it so
[1:20:24] simple when we make it so hard
[1:20:27] so simple as flipping a light switch
[1:20:30] power's already there
[1:20:32] revelation of Jesus Christ listen but
[1:20:35] the prevailing overcoming church is
[1:20:38] built on Revelation so we can expect God
[1:20:40] look we can expect God to reveal his
[1:20:43] truth to us that's a prophet telling us
[1:20:45] it he expects God to do this
[1:20:48] and so do we because it's the word of
[1:20:50] God any promise in the word of God Is
[1:20:52] Ours
[1:20:54] so we can expect God to reveal his truth
[1:20:57] to us however you actually don't need a
[1:20:59] revelation on water baptism it's right
[1:21:02] there staring you in the face
[1:21:04] I bet you let me see when that was
[1:21:06] that was in
[1:21:09] when he preached those 60 or 61 because
[1:21:11] I don't have a dog I cut it off
[1:21:13] it was the revelation of Jesus Christ of
[1:21:15] little bitty books there was a lot of
[1:21:17] trinitarians sitting in that
[1:21:18] congregation at that time a lot and he
[1:21:22] just burnt her hide right in front of
[1:21:23] him
[1:21:24] he said this is right here staring you
[1:21:27] in the face
[1:21:29] no man knows the things of God save the
[1:21:31] spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit
[1:21:32] of God reveals them brother Ryan said we
[1:21:34] need to call on God for Revelation more
[1:21:36] than anything else in the world or
[1:21:37] Brother Ray by the way I need this I
[1:21:39] need this pray for revelation
[1:21:43] if you have a problem pray for
[1:21:45] revelation
[1:21:46] if you have an issue pray for revelation
[1:21:48] more than anything else in the world
[1:21:51] you have accepted the Bible
[1:21:53] we have accepted the great truths of it
[1:21:56] we got all the truths down
[1:21:58] but it still is not real to most people
[1:22:02] because the Revelation by the spirit is
[1:22:04] not there
[1:22:06] it's words on a page
[1:22:10] we're a message believer
[1:22:13] well what message do you believe well I
[1:22:15] don't believe brother Ram was right over
[1:22:16] here but he was right over here I don't
[1:22:17] believe this is right over here I don't
[1:22:18] believe brother so and so right and it's
[1:22:19] not right and that's a boy
[1:22:22] it's like Paul Harvey said one time I
[1:22:23] was talking about brother about this
[1:22:25] message being a cult he said he said no
[1:22:27] I said the message is not a cult
[1:22:30] a cult they follow their leader
[1:22:35] just saying
[1:22:38] look what God's I mean look what God's
[1:22:40] give us in the end time and what Satan's
[1:22:42] doing he's going right to the top
[1:22:45] he's going to tear it down
[1:22:46] make us make us doubt
[1:22:49] whether the 12 people fell off the
[1:22:51] bridge
[1:22:54] I don't care
[1:22:59] yeah but he was supposed to be I don't
[1:23:03] care
[1:23:05] he has brought me a Clarity to the word
[1:23:08] of God more than any other man James
[1:23:11] Dobson all them people included and
[1:23:13] that's what I'll put my soul on on that
[1:23:16] because that man can make a mistake but
[1:23:19] that God can't
[1:23:23] somebody said one time said I'll believe
[1:23:25] I I would believe brother branham's
[1:23:27] opinion rather than most people's
[1:23:30] Revelation right that's about true
[1:23:32] but look
[1:23:33] we'll close right here I don't have time
[1:23:35] to get any further
[1:23:38] but this is talking about you
[1:23:40] he says because the Revelation this
[1:23:42] layer the word has
[1:23:43] weakened
[1:23:44] mechanics Dynamics all right the Bible
[1:23:47] says in second Corinthians 5 21 that we
[1:23:50] have become
[1:23:51] the righteousness of God by our Union
[1:23:54] with Jesus Christ now that's that Center
[1:23:56] guy right there that Union is in that
[1:23:59] middle realm called the soul
[1:24:02] it's did you get it
[1:24:04] it says that we are the very
[1:24:06] righteousness of God himself by being in
[1:24:10] Christ
[1:24:11] it says that he Jesus became sin for us
[1:24:15] it does not say he became sinful
[1:24:18] but he became sin for us that by our
[1:24:22] Union with him by what by knowing him
[1:24:26] by knowing him
[1:24:29] the people that know their God will do
[1:24:32] exploit
[1:24:34] if we accept the fact
[1:24:37] and we must
[1:24:39] that he literally became sin for us by
[1:24:43] his substitution for us then we must
[1:24:46] also accept the fact that we buy our
[1:24:49] Union with him have become the very
[1:24:51] righteousness of God
[1:24:54] to reject one is to reject the other
[1:24:58] to accept one is to accept the other
[1:25:01] which one do you want to accept tonight
[1:25:04] amen you think about it
[1:25:06] now we know the Bible says that it can't
[1:25:09] be denied but the revelation of it is
[1:25:12] missing that's the prophet
[1:25:14] it is not real to the majority look it's
[1:25:17] not real to the majority of God's
[1:25:18] children
[1:25:20] not the devil's kids
[1:25:23] you know what he's talking about he's
[1:25:24] talking about a further walk with God
[1:25:26] he's talking about okay you're born
[1:25:28] again you're in the family of God you're
[1:25:29] in the line of adoption you're just not
[1:25:31] going anywhere
[1:25:33] you're malnourished you quit eating you
[1:25:35] quit fellowshipping you don't come to
[1:25:37] church you don't do you don't read your
[1:25:39] Bible you don't study how you gonna get
[1:25:41] something from God
[1:25:42] okay it can't be denied but the
[1:25:45] revelation of it is missing it is not
[1:25:47] real to the majority of God's children
[1:25:48] it is just a good verse in the Bible
[1:25:52] are a good quote but we need to have it
[1:25:55] made alive
[1:25:57] to us
[1:25:59] that will take revelation
[1:26:05] what is a revelation somebody you know
[1:26:07] what's your idea of a revelation
[1:26:09] to me it's like that aha moment you have
[1:26:13] you you just didn't see something all of
[1:26:15] a sudden
[1:26:17] it was there all the time
[1:26:22] you know
[1:26:23] I love math and man I mean you could
[1:26:25] there was there would be a piece left
[1:26:27] out or something and you couldn't
[1:26:28] understand it but once that piece of the
[1:26:30] puzzle or once you've got to your A's
[1:26:33] and B's and C's and and uh I know shake
[1:26:36] your head it's okay yeah no we're not no
[1:26:39] boy boys wanted to play an instrument he
[1:26:41] said oh that's not it when you get to a
[1:26:44] plus b and then all the squares and
[1:26:47] somebody told me the other day what I
[1:26:49] was missing who was that told me that
[1:26:52] Adam was it you or or Levi
[1:26:55] when I was talking about a number that
[1:26:57] just kept repeating itself that it never
[1:26:59] wasn't it didn't have a definition it's
[1:27:01] pi
[1:27:03] what is it
[1:27:05] and it just keeps going there's no end
[1:27:08] to it well that's not God in that aspect
[1:27:11] because they just using that is you know
[1:27:14] it fits but it don't fit everything
[1:27:16] so now it's your confused we'll move
[1:27:18] right along for everyone that uses milk
[1:27:20] is unskillful in the word of
[1:27:21] righteousness for he's a baby can't
[1:27:23] understand a plus b equals c
[1:27:26] but once I got to that part of a I told
[1:27:29] you many times what helped me was my uh
[1:27:31] college football I mean baseball coach
[1:27:33] he would give us the answer and we had
[1:27:35] to back it into we had to make
[1:27:38] the not the question but we had to put
[1:27:40] all the numbers in to get to that
[1:27:43] and that was hard
[1:27:45] it's hard enough getting everything
[1:27:46] together and then getting the answer but
[1:27:48] when he wrote The Answer up on the board
[1:27:50] and you had to create the problem
[1:27:53] that was a problem that's why it was
[1:27:55] called that
[1:27:56] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[1:27:58] of what a full age even those who by
[1:28:01] look by reason of use
[1:28:05] have their senses exercised
[1:28:08] to discern both Good and Evil
[1:28:12] to discern means to separate make a
[1:28:15] distinction discriminate or to prefer
[1:28:19] we're Discerning right now
[1:28:21] you're Discerning God's Discerning your
[1:28:23] thoughts and intents he's taken me down
[1:28:24] one road that you need and he's taking
[1:28:26] me down another road somebody else needs
[1:28:28] he's taken you to when the brother comes
[1:28:30] up here and preaches that you've never
[1:28:32] met before and he preaches like you
[1:28:34] swear he was in your house last night
[1:28:38] how'd you know that well it wasn't him
[1:28:41] it was the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:28:44] intents of the heart brother Branham had
[1:28:46] it in a great gift worldwide we have it
[1:28:48] in little bitty gift
[1:28:51] discernment has not left the church
[1:28:53] but now that part of the discernment one
[1:28:56] gift to one generation brother Brown
[1:28:57] said when you can bring that person up
[1:28:59] here discern it 100 and do it not two or
[1:29:02] three times do it hundreds of thousands
[1:29:03] of times
[1:29:07] see now it happens hundreds of thousands
[1:29:09] of times all over the world
[1:29:11] it's not in one person it's all over the
[1:29:13] world that discernment and I wrote
[1:29:15] myself a note teach us
[1:29:18] because watch this preach the word be
[1:29:19] instant in season out of season
[1:29:21] magicians get ready to come reprove
[1:29:23] rebuke it start with all go ahead and
[1:29:25] actually come on with long all
[1:29:27] long-suffering and Doctrine for the time
[1:29:29] will come
[1:29:30] when they will tell you to press play
[1:29:35] when they will not endure sound Doctrine
[1:29:37] but after their own lust shall they Heap
[1:29:41] to themselves look Heap to themselves
[1:29:43] teachers having itching ears and they
[1:29:46] shall turn away their ears from what the
[1:29:47] truth and shall be turned into Fables
[1:29:51] II Peter 2 1 but there were false
[1:29:54] prophets among the people even as there
[1:29:56] shall be false teachers among you who
[1:29:59] privately shall bring indomitable
[1:30:01] heresies even denying the Lord that
[1:30:04] bought them
[1:30:05] and brought unto them Swift
[1:30:07] destruction and many shall follow their
[1:30:10] pernicious ways
[1:30:12] pernicious is the same word as
[1:30:14] prediction
[1:30:18] Judas was the son of what Perdition
[1:30:20] confusion destruction all right so it
[1:30:23] will follow in their destructive Ways by
[1:30:25] reason of whom the way of truth shall be
[1:30:28] evil spoken of
[1:30:30] wow
[1:30:33] be in the message and talk evil of the
[1:30:35] messenger how in the world can you do
[1:30:37] that
[1:30:38] let's stand our feet
[1:30:41] Hebrews 5 11 says of whom we have many
[1:30:43] things to say and hard to be uttered
[1:30:45] seeing you are dull of hearing that word
[1:30:48] dull is slothful slow sluggish indolent
[1:30:52] dull and languid it's just like
[1:30:56] for a win for the time you ought to be
[1:30:58] teachers you have need that one teach
[1:31:01] you again
[1:31:03] which be the first principles of the
[1:31:05] Oracles of God you know what the first
[1:31:06] principle of the Oracle of God is
[1:31:08] the Ten Commandments
[1:31:11] that's what the Jews had
[1:31:13] you know what Paul's saying Paul's
[1:31:15] saying please get up here in the in the
[1:31:17] New Testament but it looks like all you
[1:31:19] need is you need to be taught the simple
[1:31:22] things of the Ten Commandments first
[1:31:25] that's a good place to start
[1:31:27] but let's don't stay there
[1:31:29] you do not have to tell anybody in this
[1:31:31] building I hope not that thou shalt not
[1:31:33] kill
[1:31:35] okay our commit adultery are all the
[1:31:37] other one of The Commandments
[1:31:39] we shouldn't have to preach about that
[1:31:41] all the time
[1:31:43] but he said
[1:31:45] Paul said you have need that one teach
[1:31:48] you again which be the first principles
[1:31:49] of the Oracles of God and our become
[1:31:51] such as have need of milk and not of
[1:31:54] strong meat let me read this real quick
[1:31:55] having a form of godliness so there's
[1:31:57] people going to have a form of godliness
[1:31:59] but deny what deny what I was talking
[1:32:01] about not deny that there's a Bible not
[1:32:03] deny the tears of God not deny that
[1:32:05] there's a prophet not deny
[1:32:07] that there's a message
[1:32:09] but you deny the power of it
[1:32:12] you deny the power of it
[1:32:15] from such
[1:32:17] I'm gonna I'm gonna interject or
[1:32:19] interplay from such run away
[1:32:22] not turn away run away it will do you no
[1:32:25] good look for this sort are they which
[1:32:27] creep in the houses leading captive
[1:32:29] silly churches
[1:32:31] women in the churches right Laden with
[1:32:34] sins LED away with many lust
[1:32:37] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:32:40] the knowledge
[1:32:41] of the truth
[1:32:44] last one
[1:32:46] let us hold fast to profession of our
[1:32:48] faith
[1:32:49] without wavering
[1:32:52] for he is faithful that promised him
[1:32:55] and let us consider one another to
[1:32:57] provoke and to love and good works not
[1:33:00] for say who put that in there again
[1:33:03] not forsaking the ascending of ourselves
[1:33:05] together as a matter of some is but look
[1:33:07] exhorting one another and so much more
[1:33:09] as you see the day approaching for if we
[1:33:12] sin willfully now look
[1:33:15] and we'll say this one more time when if
[1:33:17] a preacher preaches something and it's
[1:33:19] the truth and he preaches it and
[1:33:21] presents it to you in ABC like this
[1:33:23] right here you need to be in church
[1:33:24] every time the door is open
[1:33:26] for if you sin willfully after you have
[1:33:29] received that knowledge there's no more
[1:33:31] sacrifice for your sins
[1:33:35] I'm just reading you the Bible
[1:33:38] we wonder why we're tossed about
[1:33:42] it's because we're going to do
[1:33:43] everything God says
[1:33:46] instead of brother brother they'll
[1:33:48] preached matching pieces years ago we
[1:33:49] got missing pieces
[1:33:52] not me too
[1:33:57] that's why he preached matching pieces
[1:33:58] because when what matches down here
[1:34:00] matches up there they're going to
[1:34:02] connect
[1:34:03] remember it vulcanized but he can't be
[1:34:05] Rubber and Bricks it's got to be rubber
[1:34:08] to rubber
[1:34:09] vulcanized together now remember this
[1:34:11] Christ in the true church is a
[1:34:13] continuation of the book of Acts
[1:34:15] but the Book of Revelation shows how
[1:34:17] that the Antichrist Spirit would come
[1:34:18] into the church look defile it make it
[1:34:21] lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:34:24] that doesn't sound like the word I'm
[1:34:26] used to
[1:34:28] it exposes Satan revealing his work the
[1:34:32] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:34:34] and the discrediting of God's word and
[1:34:37] let me interject something and God's
[1:34:39] people and God's prophet
[1:34:42] right down to the time he is casting the
[1:34:45] Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot
[1:34:47] stand it he knows if the people get the
[1:34:50] true revelation of the true church
[1:34:54] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:34:57] and that she can do the greater work she
[1:34:59] will be an invincible Army
[1:35:01] if they get a true Revelation what of
[1:35:04] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:35:06] the Christian church
[1:35:09] not that church out there
[1:35:11] this church right here
[1:35:13] within the framework of the Christian
[1:35:15] church and by God's spirit discern
[1:35:18] by knowledge knowledge that's why that
[1:35:20] knowledge is sold down at the bottom
[1:35:22] here at the pyramid we've got to have
[1:35:24] that we've got to have knowledge and we
[1:35:28] stand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will
[1:35:30] be what say that with me powerless
[1:35:33] before her one more time powerless
[1:35:36] before her he will be as definitely
[1:35:39] thwarted today is when Christ withstood
[1:35:41] his every effort to gain power over him
[1:35:44] in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation
[1:35:46] but we love it
[1:35:48] with a true Revelation in our lives the
[1:35:50] gates of hell
[1:35:52] cannot Prevail against us but we will
[1:35:55] prevail
[1:35:56] over them
[1:35:58] let's sing a song
[1:36:02] [Music]
[1:36:04] oh to Jesus I Surrender
[1:36:11] to hear my
[1:36:13] freely give

[1:40:13] it's real
[1:40:15] cause we've seen it real

[1:40:23] you've heard brother Dale tell about it
[1:40:24] that that deer hunting with us
[1:40:26] had prostate cancer four months to live
[1:40:30] doctor told him to go hunt

[1:40:46] shape
[1:40:47] he needs help
[1:40:49] so Dad reaching his bill phone we always
[1:40:52] carry him either in our pocket or on
[1:40:54] Acts 19 in our Bible
[1:40:57] so he just took the prayer cloth he
[1:40:58] walked over to him and he said Terry he
[1:41:01] said this is a prayer cloth that we
[1:41:03] prayed over
[1:41:04] should you believe
[1:41:06] don't believe in the cloth do you
[1:41:08] believe in the prayer that was behind it
