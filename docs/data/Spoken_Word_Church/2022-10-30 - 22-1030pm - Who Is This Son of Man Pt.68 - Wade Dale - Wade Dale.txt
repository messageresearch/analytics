fill you up you know I was um writing the Young Brother a friend of mine grew up in church in Maryland and he's in prison I was just writing him yesterday and um Lord just put on my heart I said my goodness you know he came he was in the message born in the message I probably told it before and ran out there and got in trouble and end up murdering a guy and he's been in prison 36 years old he'd been in prison for probably about maybe close to 18 years now you know and um you know I said my goodness you know we just looked back and the Brokenness you know that's what I was telling him I said my as I'm over 40 I'm looking at my own life and seeing some of the Brokenness you know maybe from my parents the past that I didn't know it affected me I thought I was strong but you know we grew up in the message you know and and to see my mom and dad as some of the older ones who knew them and they got divorced and that has an impact on you you know when you're in this word this this word that should be holding us together you know but I thank God because God's grace was over the problems that they had to pull us in and now we're fighting with everything that we have Amen to live this out and that's what the younger generation needs they need to see a life lived by the grace of God and it means we got to fight like brother Wade was saying we got to fight for every inch we got to fight through our marriage fight for our children fight to manifest what God is saying to us amen by his grace and praise the Lord and we're doing that one day at a time so I know my wife wanted to sing that amen God bless you all that's the only song that come to my heart right now Just One Day at a Time I'm only you mine I'm just a woman Lord help me believe what I can be and all that I am show me the pathway that I had to climb Lord For my sake help me to take one day at a time one day at a time sweet Jesus that is all that I'm asking from you you Lord give me the strength to do it everything

heart in this day this one day that we're in let's ask God to open our hearts bless our brother use him as a vessel this afternoon foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord I want to see you good job brother appreciate you shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy [Music] shining in the light of Glory thank you Lord amen [Music] your power in love As we sing Holy Holy holy holy you love him today holy holy holy Lord holy holy holy Lord holy holy holy I want to see here high and lifted up when I think about that you know what I think about they hoisted my God up on a tree one time as an offering for me and you he had to be high and lifted up he had to be lifted up between Heaven and Earth I love what brother Brown said Heaven didn't want him Earth didn't want him so he hung Between Heaven and Earth he couldn't go back to Heaven because he had our sins on him couldn't come back to earth because we couldn't have died for sin but he died Between Heaven and Earth so when I that song means a lot more than just than just a song it's high and lifted up those priests didn't know what they were doing when they were taking that offering and they would wave it and then there would be a heave offering where they'd raise it up and down the sign of the cross knowing that they would have to heave the Lamb of God up off of the Earth so that he can hang Between Heaven and Earth and take mine in your sins and be able now now we can enter in to the holy of holies now we can enter into heaven with no sin because he took our sin he became sin that we could be what righteousness and that's what we're looking today we want to further go further than just uh brother Josh Bennett last night or not before last one whenever he was preaching he was speaking on in other words I've been baptized now what going Beyond water baptism because we love to get everybody baptized and like I said we got all these people baptized that's fine but we got to go that's just the beginning that's just the start that's just down at the bottom that ain't even on the pyramids yet that's way down below there under the foundation all right but what are we going to do we're going to keep going on we're going to strive and push and pull and brother Ernie used to say well if we don't have no teeth we'll gum the devil to death we'll hack him we'll strike him we'll hit him we'll do whatever we can do because we know we're Victorious we know we win he just don't know it yet bless his heart but remember the ones coming back from the Youth Camp remember brother Louise will be speaking for us Wednesday night on the fifth there'll be no Bible study um we'll have a rehearsal here for the ones who are going to be in the in the wedding time changes next Saturday night change the clock back before you go to bed November the 6th which will be that Sunday we have one service here and Zach and literally be married at four o'clock that afternoon in Georgia if you don't have the um address then get it from uh sister Monica or brother Bob or or look on that whatever that Lily and Zach are getting married blah blah blah whatever that says so anyway well we've been announcing nothing left we're getting down now it's crunch time ma'am there will be no second service obviously and then Bob will be speaking for us on the ninth the 13th will be uh we'll have one service and then we'll have our dinner and if you have not talked to Sister June or sister Esther you need to talk to them about what to bring um the church is going to do the uh a couple of turkeys and and some spiral ham and then y'all will bring all the rest of it for the the I keep wanting to say condiments but it's not side dishes all right side dishes so um remember that there'll be no second service that that Sunday it'll be the dinner then on the 22nd there'll be um Church on Tuesday on November 22nd on the 20th brother Andrew Glover will be here with you two services and just remember these things I know December is coming up but remember the fourth that will be our one service and then we'll be going to the Hidden Acres to do our have our Christmas annual Christmas dinner so you love the Lord and also remember it won't be long February the 11th I think we'll be doing having our Valentine's banquet so Wowie man that's only four months from now less than four months from now good grief time flies thank goodness time's flying I don't want it to be back you know when we were growing up you'd say boy you're the slowest Christmas you can't say that now when I was a kid Christmas came about every three years uh Ruth but now it comes every three months so you can't say it's the Lord's Christmas anymore because Christmas is fast approaching we'll be here in just any moment now so let's just remember these in prayer remember the ministers that are coming remember the ones that are coming back brother Boyd and brother Louise and brother Aaron are bringing the kids back and we kind of got all that figured out so everything's going well with that and I'm glad they had a good time I'm sure we'll have some good testimonies from them they sang just a few minutes ago at the uh at the service they sang the song so um we've been represented well this weekend brother Aaron and him has been brother boy they've been keeping up with everything bro Luis so we thank God that we can help them out shoulder to shoulder helping to what forward the gospel to the youth amen so let's buy our heads Lord thank you for this day thank you for the time you've given us we pray now that you would just set aside everything just for a moment of time so we can talk about you Lord and you do the one that speaks father you'll be the one that as we study and and look at these different things and different quotes and different scriptures Lord we pray that you've put them together and not man father we pray that you just be with each one that's on the highways Lord with the weather being like it is I pray this should touch each one father be with our youth Lord and continue to strengthen them and bring them up in admonition of the Lord and father I pray that you'd save the Lost Lord bring the ones Lord the end they're sick Lord sin sick more than anything Lord Heal the one sister gay on the different ones Lord that are sick sister Freda and the different ones Lord do we we don't know everything's going on there we pray that you'll just be with each one that's not here a little bride around the world Lord we need you father be with the missionaries Lord and the different ones that are doing their work Lord in the Philippines Jamaica in different places we pray India and all those Lord we think of them often and we pray Lord that you will just be with them continually just bless us now and take care of us in Jesus name amen you saw that my sister Chichi she was almost it was almost underwater there at her house because of the rain and typhoons but the rain stopped rain stopped before it got to your house rain stopped when the bride goes to praying let me tell you something demons start going they going wild hold on hold on hold on what's going on here we never felt this kind of power before that's the power that you and I have on the face of this Earth today as the Bride of Jesus Christ there has not been with there's no one has has worked under an open book you and I work under an open book yeah not closed it's an open book and anything any promise in this Bible is what available to the bride now man it's available to each one of us so let's start here just a little bit more of what we were doing this morning and we'll talk a little bit about memories and conscious effects and Imagination because that's where the devil plays and that's where God actually does his work also so let's read here in the beginning was the word and where it was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth as we were talking about this morning you are his glory in other words you are what remember he was he was in John was on the Isle of Patmos he looked over in Book of Revelations he heard the voice he had heard that voice on Earth he knew it was the Lord Jesus but it was surprised when he turned and looked and there was the son of man gird about the paths with a golden girdle in Bride form all right and then John gets over into Revelation he said man there's bride everywhere he said there's Revelations 19. we got people coming back then over here in Revelations 21 or 22 when the city comes down and it looks like the bride the bride's just everywhere and the bride is the whole like brother Dale's always said the bride's book is a book of Revelations because it tells about us and our walk in life and our journey how we got here how what we're doing while we're here and when we're going home and the future home that we're going to be in so behold in glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now listen let me tell you something let's talk about this other day if God said this you're going to be his glory you're going to be his victory he's got to make a way that somebody does it all right so he's going to make a way he saw somebody by foreknowledge he saw somebody do exactly what he said and they made it amen amen so therefore somebody's going to make it you can't say you can't say well I can't do that well you're the only one stopping you all right so first Thessalonians 4 says every one of you should know how to possess this vessel and sanctification and honor you know as we go through this statue of perfect man when we get into the virtues I want you to be able to when you go into your life lesson which starts on Monday for those of us that work your life your life lesson starts on Monday and continues on through until the next week and that you can say man that used to bother me but that don't bother me anymore that used to hurt my feelings but that'll hurt my feelings anymore I used to handle it this way but now I handle it this way to me that's the renewing of your mind that's the changing of what you were doing and listen what you've done all your life right man that's right I'm 62 there's things I've done for at least 50 years that I'm not proud of and they don't some of them don't bother me sister Anna and then the only thing that's bothering me is you know you get then your body starts bothering you you know somebody told me one time as you get older you only worry about one thing I said what's that he said survival [Laughter] don't worry about it what do you worry about worry about surviving all right as we get older that's and that's just the way it is so listen and that's what we got to worry about now surviving surviving this world surviving this age listen even though we got the open book it's the darkest age it ever was right there's never been the highest power of demons on earth now listen I just told you that the highest power of of the Bride is on the Earth today but there's got to be a someone to combat that's where that greatest battle is because remember it's two it's too fat battling like this and what whichever we feed is the one that wins be not conform to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God you may be said what is the will of God it's his word so we're going to produce the word of God but we're not going to produce it on paper we're going to produce it in human flesh all right now that's his that's his John 1 1 I just read it John 1 14. in the beginning was the word words with God's word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us all right so the first thing we got to do over and over again I want you to know that we got to be born again if you're not born again remember what was it this morning that fountain that is that is Flowing out of your soul is bitter if you're not born again there's not a trickle of this and a trickle of that and and you've got this see down inside of you that's trying to you're lost I'll read you a quote here in a few minutes brother Brown said you were born in this world a sinner lost he said with no hope with no hope so let's just keep it that way I like it like that that way I know I was lost and now I'm found that way I know I had no choice in this at all as far as what I saw but I did have a choice but I made that choice for the foundation of the world God saw me make that choice and he knew and had it what I think I got to hear her back there brother Brown said before the world was formed this Bible was written exactly as it's written today because how can you change the word of God you can't change the word of God once it's written it's forever written in heaven and it was in the mind of God exactly Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph us John Paul P all that was already four new by God and by foreknowledge he knew exactly what we would do and then what do we do in Ephesians 4 11 he would send us a FireFold Ministry he would send us a way to get this not get it by herself but a way to get it what through human beings because the seed life comes through the body all right because what does the seed if you've got the seed life inside of you you can give it out that's what we're talking about virtue you can't give that kind of Godly virtue if you don't have it already inside of you all right can't because remember it's like you trying to manufacture something the the black birds sticking the peacock feathers in you know or or the wolf and sheep's clothing you're going to manifest being a a sheep or a goat one of the two or a wolf you might fool somebody sometime but you're not gonna feel fool God ever ever gonna fool God all right so right here's where we're at today we're born again we're coming up to a place to where now we realize we need these virtues in our life we need this to do one thing and that show Christ you don't want to show yourself you don't want to show the preacher you want to show Christ in you because remember in the book of Ephesus when you sell the Bible says they were called First Call Christians because they acted like Christ he didn't talk about Paul it talks about the church at Ephesus the church folks the church people were acting like Christ so they were called Christians in Antioch I believe and not Ephesians but Antioch he would call Christians in Antioch because they act like Christ right that's what we want to be affiliated with because remember um when you look at Christianity out in the world I mean it just has no moral it just has no it has no standard you can do pretty much whatever you want to do we were driving by a few minutes or this morning and one of the churches there on on the road coming up here the the girls were walking out of the uh Fellowship Halls away from the church and here they come out and one girl had like spandex um workout drawers pants on whatever you try to call and she was heading toward Church she wasn't going to the she went she wasn't going to the to the workout place she was going to church and it looked like she had just got up out of the bed and went to church so there's no standard you and I have a standard listen God's not obligated to work through that but he is obligated to work through this if we live the right life he's absolutely obligated to what his word all right we fail miserably but folks we we know there's one thing for sure they don't have what we got right and I don't separate them they're separating theirself and God said separate yourself from that right now listen he called them he didn't have a problem calling them and prostitutes amen so we shouldn't have a problem calling him that either no not to people the system love the sinner hate the sin all right but that thing's wrong that is a prostitute system working outside of this message of the hour the true message of the hour the True born-again Believer the true people that have messed I'm sorry they are in a prostitute system that's what the Bible says the great and her daughters all right so everybody with me on that I'm not talking about the people but but if they're caught in that system what are they right they're that system it takes people to make that work but what it does it took somebody to stand in the pulpit and say oh honey it's okay you can wear what you want to wear to church Come As You Are that's all right you can come as you are one time maybe twice but you'll never come back here if you get something you'll be changed you'll be able to walk and drive down the road and look at us standing outside and see a different set of people just by what we're wearing just by why we're not over there smoking in the wind got a smoking section over here in the parking lot for the for the Baptists that smoke they talk about the methods that drink and the methods talk about them to smoke so here we go but thank God for the truth I thank God for the truth not that I'm not that I stand up like the Pharisee don't ever stand up and say I'm glad I'm not like that person no I say Lord without you I'd be that person without you I'd be in that system out there listen without God I wouldn't be in that system I'd be in the devil system way out you under somewhere with no religion at all right and so would some of us yeah yeah then we talk about we talked about the Paradox I still enjoy about the what brother Brown was talking about this he's talking about the stand a decision you know it all works together for the good way you do it never heard them at least him in other words the fiery trials we have to go through the fiery furnace at the three Hebrew children went through they thought they were going to die actually it loosed them from what they were they were prisoners to What A system that said you've got to stand and bow to this image which is your friend they thought I mean the King Nebuchadnezzar probably when he said that he said I'll throw them in the fire remember then then he comes up one day and he gets all mad he says if they don't if if you catch them worshiping God then then put them in the Lion's Den well the first person that went was his friend Daniel Daniel had interpreted his dreams and he'd give him up you know Daniel was a he was a good man in the community but the king couldn't take back what he said either so he thought Daniel wasn't going to do that but Daniel did he remember he threw the his brother Brown said he threw them he didn't just barely crack the windows he threw him open and he worshiped toward what the temple there where where the worshiper was supposed to go and he couldn't get there because remember he's in captivity all right but he still worshiped listen even in captivity they should worship God so even in our captivity we should be able to worship God Amen and spirit and Truth all right listen Last Story brother random talks about committing committing it to him the greatest weapon that an old Christian needs today or uses today is a committal to God committed to God don't try to give it to me and God give it to God when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it now listen as human beings that's at least one of the hardest things you'll ever do is take somebody you love with all your heart and commit them to God and then take your hands completely off of them and whatever happens happens as we were talking about this morning if your kids get sick it's hard not to pray for them but what if God put that on them what if God did that but if he put it on to drive him back and here we're trying to pray for him to get it off of them so the best thing to do is say God save their soul save their soul I want that listen I want their soul to walk in this door I don't want just a person I want their soul to walk you I want that soul to say I need to go I need to change because that's where it's going to what if they walk in here with just the same old bitter Fountain right no you wanted to come in here wanting something you know what they want your fountain man I hope I remember the greatest battle ever fought we know where it's at and it's ready to go into action God's been selecting his soldiers listen this battle the battle between Satan and death has never been won before oh don't get quiet on me now Jesus died he died for me and you but he died a human death but you and I've got to come to a place that we don't die human death matter yeah listen I was thinking back there a few minutes ago we talk about defeating Satan the only time Satan is going to be truly totally defeated is when he's thrown into the into the Lake of Fire but he's getting a temporary beaten right now because we're going to beat him so bad in the Millennium till he ain't gonna have nothing he's going to be like somebody that's walking around trying to find somebody to work through I can't find this one man what what what do you mean because remember Satan is not thrown in a pit like this and he's going to be there for a thousand years now I believe he's going to be there he's going to be somewhere he's just going to be held back by what a chain of circumstances the prophet said and who is that circumstances me and you you and I are the circumstance he can't work through man amen but now right now today as you said today and as I stand here today he is working he's full well on the job at the moment all right but when we get into Millennium we're going to have a body change so what we're gonna we're gonna take and we're gonna preempt that we know the show and the stage is set for the Millennium where he'll be Chained and and you know not be he'll be bound for a thousand years and not be able to work in US but Folks at the body change he's going to be bound by us and not be able to work in us anymore the reason he's working now is because there's death still warring in our members as Paul said all right things I would not I do things I do it was not Paul Paul had the same thing about you same thing with me and you going up tattoo perfect man that's the same they had the same problems things I would not I do things I do not I would what was warring his his soul was the if anybody was born again Paul was born again he wrote half the Bible or more than half of the New Testament so he had to have the new birth everybody with me all right but he still had problems he was a first church-aged messenger he was a prophet and he still had problems the things I would not I do things I do not I would there's a thing warring in my members Paul listen Paul didn't have that problem when he was persecuting Christians right that's right no he just said ah and he was zealous in what he was doing wasn't just Paul going I think I'll get two three today no he went after the whole church if I didn't get the whole church he's figured he didn't have a good day that's how zealous Paul was to get them people out of there oh they're worshiping some false god and they think Jesus was if all they just told me he was some old some old guy you know that they followed and now he's dead boy did he have a rude awakening did he not have not have variance in that day when God himself knocked him off of that horse and said Paul I'm Jesus who you persecute and he's like man I'm done for her Jesus said no I did this because you're my first church age messenger he didn't know that but that's what God said you're my first church ain't messing you're going to get this thing started and you're going to save more people than you put in prison listen Paul's words are still saving people now that's Paul's Doctrine he said you'll be judged by my doctrine that was Paul's Doctrine and that's how we get saved by that Doctrine yes so he's still getting people saved that's how good a church age Mastery was but Jesus said listen you know Jesus is standing there one day and in eternity and he's going if he can do that for the devil you know this just be me and you if he could do that for the devil think what he can do for me think what he can do for me if I just change him a little bit knock him off his horse he got knocked off his high horse amen have you ever been knocked off your high horse it's not a real soft Landing I'll promise you that no you're gonna hurt for days but that's all right thank God at least God's want to knock you off the horse not the devil amen so I believe he's dressing he's dressing us now he's training us what he's training us how to take care of this life that we're living right now not past life this life this life right here the life that I now live Paul said I live by the faith of the son of God right now so he's dressing and training us the Battlefront is set knew where it is then the mind we know that it's the greatest battle ever fought it begins in the human mind and that's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the excuse me the place of battle where it was beginning it's because that decisions are made from the mind we'll get into that just a minute with memory region and conscious effects and Imagination then we there's the quote that we read every time we're going to read it again listen you have to suffer to rain this is not a picnic he says not the cruise ship he says not to Love Boat this is a USS Benjamin Franklin or whatever the no the greatest big one was John F Kennedy yeah this is USS John F Kennedy this is the we're on the boat now that that there's a fight every day you wake up every day and it's like Pearl Harbor all over again hey man if it's not for y'all pray for me please the reason is that character simply never is made without suffering character is a victory not a gift in other words God didn't give you this gift you gotta earn it it's a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from this character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule look if it was purpose to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still until you haven't got until you haven't got patience virtue and all these things brotherly kindness and all these things that's required so it's a requirement right Richard it's requirement hey man if you didn't know it you know it now it's a requirement this is required study this is this is your curriculum from now until the day you passed away or we take a body change and don't let up don't go third grade and say no I need to quit no somebody's going to graduate and the diploma they're going to get is a body change that's your diploma it's a body change if you go by the grade before then that's okay but somebody's got to get us up out of the ground somebody's got to come to this Perfection and then we were talking about hey you know it's all in your head well it all this is where I want to show you where memory reasoning conscious effects and Imagination it all starts in your head right you can't level your stomach well you can love to eat maybe but that comes from your mind that comes from your stomach telling your mind I need to eat right what we always say it has a mind of its own no it has one mind it originates from one place right it's not two or three different Minds no we're not some kind of schizophrenic with several different um uh whatever call characteristics or several different ways you know several different people several different people no you're either God or the devil one of the two James 1 6 is but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waverth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable look in all his ways that's why you see people struggle when they're they're they're they're in they're in that uh transition of justification sanctification baptism in the Holy Ghost and if they don't go on to the Holy Ghost there'll be a double-minded person they'll have just enough religion to be over here and just enough of of the devil to be right here but remember if it like what was Bob preaching the other day right a question that's not totally answered in other words it's not true it's false right it's got to be complete truth because Eve got 99 truth from Satan not was included and that's it Thou shalt die surely die Thou shalt not surely die so a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways he's wavering he's uncertain he's doubting he's divided in interest what he wants to serve God and he wants to serve the devil too he wants to stay just in between so that he can do either one you know lean one way and you can tell that because those people are in and out of church they disappear they come back I'm sorry that's double-minded because if you're single-minded you'll come to church because mind of Christ comes to church all right the mind of the devil gives you every other excuse to stay out but the right mental attitude I love what brother Brown says about that because it's not it's not knowing the seals or knowing Daniel 70 weeks or the plagues of the vowels at this moment we're talking about but it's a right mental attitude all right it's like somebody said the other day if we come to church begrudgingly if we come to church because well if we don't really gonna say something about me then don't come right you got a walk to go Sunday's our day to worship God Sunday is our day to come together one day Wednesday too but one day Sunday we've dedicated I was thinking the other day at work I hear all of them around me and and some of them are some of them do go to church one one service but our Postmaster she's a she's not a Christian lady and she was telling them well Sunday I'm going to do this and then she'll come back on Fridays she'll say well Sunday I'm going to do this well it ain't going to church she's doing all of her work on Sunday cleaning the house cleaning the swimming pool out washing the car and you see what they're doing they're substituting something right for the desire to do something and knowing Sunday is the day set aside for God to me I see that to somebody else you may not it's like Tara said one time we was talking about having one service a Sunday and all right it came up a long time ago and he said some of y'all's already decided that so truth anyhow now the right mental attitude all you along here he's talking about people in the prayer officially being a prayer line your right mental attitude toward God's Divine promise will bring any promise to pass now maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak I wouldn't confess it don't let the devil know that always say I've got good faith I believe God with all my heart see don't testify nothing of the devil you know we always said the devil made me do it no you did it the devil might have helped you do it but you're the one that did it because Satan can't physically now listen I think about this the other day too when we come to the fullness of God we are a we are going to be the son of man on Earth again right when we take a body change or when we get to the place of the Resurrection where death is not death is going to be destroyed by somebody saying Bride come out of the ground so Paul all the way to here Satan is going to see that power don't tell me he won't he's he's a powerful being himself and he's a spiritual being himself but there's no way that he can incarnate come on somebody listen he can't incarnate the pope and while we're here because you don't know how but he watches me and you he sees how God takes over us and changes us and he's going to literally step into that Pope and be the Beast not part of the Beast system right now they're part of the Beast system he's going to be the Beast he's going to be Satan and Kearney brother Brown said I was leading the other day Satan super Satan Superman yeah it's going to be that Pope and he's going to do signs wonders Miracles they're going to believe him and the whole world is going to fall down at his feet but not me and you we're going to be gone because you know what God has incarnated a bride now and took it out to our flesh that Fountain is going to so overflow until it's going to hit our body and our atoms will change according to what's inside of you because right now you've got it all encapsulated it's kind of like you know God's in there all cocooned up we just got to let him out amen you already got your body changed inside of you it's just what what is what's stopping you your heart everybody if you're born again your heart is not what's stopping you right it's what your memory reason conscious affection imagination what you think is what's keeping us here I say you I mean all of us so brother around tells us here about what how to know the will of God look know the will of God make sure you're objective and motive is right listen the reason I'm reading this our motive and objective is to be this at this point I want you to not say well I really want to learn Daniel 70 weeks well I really want to know what them Seven Seals are forget about it until you see only you get this and you know what I understand I'm trying to make it strong I don't say forget about it don't throw your seal book away but put that sailboat right here but put that statue a perfect man book right on top of it and read that first amen you can read a church age book that's fine that'll help you but all these Mysteries we're not going to get the Mysteries Paul said you can know all Mysteries and not have charity right which is the new birth and you just said blah blah blah blah sound embarrassed in a tinkling symbol but first know the will of God and my objective is what to glorify him and my motive is to give him all the glory that's what the statue of perfect man if your objective is to make money for yourself you'll never succeed and try to do something outside of the will of the Lord it won't work to begin with wow I'm just telling you what brother I believe he was a prophet right I'm the same place okay just wanted to make sure thank you brother Ryan give me that show us the father 1963 brother Ryan said look now he's pretty strong words I go on record I say this about the word of God being a seed and if you can take the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise he will bring it to pass if you can get yourself in what position what does teaching do it positionally places you that's why I said about this church you should know where you're at at all the time amen I don't understand this I don't understand that but I do understand this I do understand that maybe I don't understand Daniel 70 weeks right now maybe somebody will go over it again but do you have brotherly kindness can you love somebody that hates your guts ain't there yet well then don't get mad at the guy that cuts you off on the road brotherly kindness is not being kind to your brother that sits in this church well maybe yeah that too but it's loving those people that hate you it's loving those people that despitefully use you the ones that put you on a cross that's the one you're supposed to and love them so much until Nobody Knows the difference that's what brother Bram that's what brother Paul said I didn't know who was Daddy's enemies and I didn't know who his friends were he treated them all the same now I believe brother Brown knew who they were but they see they didn't change his attitude none whatsoever like I said this morning about God God knew before the foundational World we'd fail or pass right we've seen his son down here tonight for everybody anyway he died for all but he knew all wasn't going to take it he knew those two million people going through it took him 40 years to go 12 miles and he fed him clothed him yeah yeah give them all kind of protection but he knew only two was going to make it but yet he what he gave him a chance he gave me and you a chance didn't he man according to his divine power has given us all things that pertains unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue whereby giving unto us what exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption of the world through lust that's what we've been talking about the new birth and then the Bible says and besides this giving all diligence that means haste earnestness Earnest and accomplishing striving after anything interest oneself most earnestly so I said don't worry about the seals right now don't worry about the plays in the vowels don't worry about what we're going to eat in a millennium don't worry about what's going to go on in the Millennium or what's going to go in the future home I mean uh the marriage supper that'll all come we want to be we want to be able to help not listen what I'm saying we won't be able to be a help to God now and you know God don't need any help but he does want to work through you amen so let's just let's focus on that so add to your faith virtue into virtue knowledge that word add means Minister Minister nourishment so we're what we're being ministered to Faith we've been ministered virtue and knowledge and Temperance we've got to get it by the ministry as I said before you may get born again listening to a tape but you will not go up this statue of perfect man without a FireFold Ministry I'll promise you that that's thus saith the Bible that's what the Bible said yeah for the perfecting of the Saints for the edifying of the ministry till we all come to what Perfection that we be not babies anymore a person of virtue makes the progression from knowing what is right to doing what is right we don't want to be a knower we want to be a doer amen I know about this message I knew about this message when I was 14 years old but I didn't do anything about it I did not do anything about it neither did you until you there's no way to do anything about it till you get born again no way you cannot do anything about it until you get born again you get born again then we can start working then God can start working on you all right so these virtues are given to us what for an energy to me it to me it supercharges it not just charges if you're born again you're already charged but this supercharges you because remember what does God want God wants to adopt you to give you the checkbook not give you the checkbook with his name already on it he wants to give you a checkbook and say Bob whatever you need you write the check but you sign it amen well he's not power without character he'll write the wrong check pie with character he'll Rock the right check you know why because he'll have the mind of God right you'll not have the mind of man or be double-minded he'll have the mind of God to be able to write your check for what somebody needs or what he needs right you're not going to go out here and be able to move a mountain you're not going to go out here to Blue Ridge Mountains and say I want you all to move to to Arizona no that's frivolous that's power without character but if you need a mountain mood in your life if you need to get around something then guess what speak the word man here we stopped this where we was at this morning talk about affecting your senses what is your senses memory reasoning conscious imagination and affection remember the center realm of you is where the fountain is the center realm I said c-e-n-t-e-r not Center if you're not born again that is you're sitting around all right but Center realm of you it's where everything comes out everything starts from deep down inside of you every well that ever was dug starts from deep down inside it pushes its way up same way with me and you and you can't have bitter water and sweet water out the same well right we already know that so you can't have the new birth and not have the new birth you either you do or you don't I mean you can't have half sometimes they're sweet sometimes it's bitter no no so let's talk about they're just for men they don't have this in the back I pulled it off them I got off the internet the word memory means the faculty by which the Mind look stores and remembers information The Faculty by which the Mind stores and remembers information it also remembers something from the past because you can't remember the future anyway hello somebody you can't remember the future you remember the now in the past that's why God knows the future and the past and if you got the mind of Christ then you can tap into that and know the future brother right I'm tapped into it saw the future Paul stepped into it saw the future John definitely stepped into it and saw the future amen so you can do that but a normal human being can't do that they can't predict the future that's why brother Branham Swain was so used of God and not used of man he was used of God to be 100 right in telling people's future yeah 100 percent you know why because he saw it by Vision he saw him there the man with the green checkered shirt brother Billy brother um biscal was in that vision for an hour and a half before he looked down and realized he had on a green check his shirt he had to fall in the water you know have you ever heard the story you're deleted see it again how miraculous it was because what happened was brother bisco and brother Brown were hunting brother Brown said remember I saw the the green checking shirt and a man with little hands whenever the best school was a young boy then had little hands but he saw a great man with a green check his shirt didn't see his face so brother biscal takes him out hunting well brother biscal is jumping across the stream and falls in the water gets his clothes wet he goes back to the tent rumbles through the tent rumbles through his stuff and his wife had put that green checking shirt in there he didn't even know it because it's dry and it was a flannel shirt he picks it up puts it on goes back out they go hunting brother Branham even doesn't notice anything about it he shoots to whatever it was the Caribou or the bear or whatever and when they look brother Brown looks down he said this is that vision and he looks up and bro you know brother bicycle is going a great picture how'd that happen brother I'm saw it in a vision he literally saw the future happen and it happened exactly the way he said it was going to happen that's why I now listen you say well that was just for brother random brother Brown said we are prophetic people yes with prophetic Insight we may not be able to see exactly why and how they're going to take our money away and we can't buy or sell but I promise you if you don't have the word of God playing it inside of you it ain't gonna matter whether you know how to figure out to get around it yeah that's one thing that I just can't stand I can't stand people that says well if this don't work I got this you know if I don't if I don't make a Rapture in other words I ain't gonna live right but just in case I want to that's a double-minded man in case I do I'm gonna put me up a little bit of gold that's why I tell you about that guy that had the little gold bars that were one ounce which is like 13 or 1500 how you gonna take out of the grocery store and say give me a loaf of bread you gonna pay fifteen hundred dollars for a loaf of bread because they're not going to sit there and shave off enough to buy you a piece of bread with George Cara is silly to try to figure out how to make it I don't want to make it through the to the um tribulation I do not so I don't want to worry myself with thinking about what I would do if I made it through the trip in in the tribulation get the get the born-again experience folks and you ain't got work get bored again you don't have to worry about it all right memory our memories what kills us what we think about our memory of the things that we used to do remember we have to ask forgiveness of the things we used to do not the things we're fixing to do right you know we've heard preachers pray for for stuff like that and I just don't believe it I don't believe that you you can pray for something you ain't never done yet it's not true that's just kind of like the Catholic Church you know coming you you're saying okay I'm going to kill somebody tomorrow I said okay pay whatever fifty thousand dollars and you're good you're absolved or whatever they call it yeah to strand I knows what it is but that that's foolishness you ask forgiveness for what you've done and then what we have to do is then if I remember if it affects listen if this affects our memories and contraception imagination then you gotta let God change your memory to the good in right and when Satan brings that memory which he can you cast it out like I said before how many times did we sit around and just think about stuff in our past why do that why do that I'm not even one that sits around and go Coulda Shoulda Woulda I mean I know sometimes you do you say man finally made that choice I could have had a lot more money you know what you may not have been sitting in a church either hello right boy if I'd imagine yeah you've been over there with so-and-so amen you wouldn't be here take your memory and remember the good things remember what God's done for you Satan can't stand for you to tell him what God's done for you because he hates that because he can't do any good for you it's always bad everything he does is bad to you you and me amen so now let's take reasoning oh boy this is a good one the action of thinking about something in a logical sensible way all right listen the action of thinking about something in a logical sensible way that's okay that's the Bible says come let us reason together in other words take the facts and bring them together not reason on something you don't understand example was he explained the reasoning behind his decision of a media conference see God does the same thing he says come let us reason together but what does he do he brings us the truth so there's our standard right everybody with me that's the standard when God brings you a something to reason on he's got the truth that's this right here what you've got to do is a reason out in your mind not if it's right or wrong it's whether you can do it or not right or whether you want to do it or not come on boy you hate that but that's okay you know maybe you read in the Bible you weren't supposed to wear pants but you did for a long time you sisters we brothers did things that we've read in the Bible maybe when we were a kid that we didn't believe because we did them already we went and did them anyway hey man but now that you have the new birth see it's not that Fountain is pure water coming up and you're reasoning on the word of God you're not reasoning whether should I drink a beer today or tomorrow should I drink early or should I drink late anybody with me say Amen okay those of you that didn't drink put over whatever's in that little spot put it in there okay it doesn't matter whichever one you want to do smoke pot dope I don't care doesn't matter put it in there but you did it anyway we reasoned on the things of the world now we reason on the word of God not reason whether it's right or wrong reason whether we can connect ourselves to it anybody with me on that you reason whether you can connect yourself to that action of thinking about something in a logical sensible way brother Branham that quote where he says what excuse me he says the right mental attitude that's reasoning the right mentality listen you're sitting here with the disease they were sitting in that in that um Auditorium maybe couldn't get out of the wheelchair because they had cancer or whatever it's real but when brother Brown says the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring that promise to path past you've got a reason that that man's telling you the truth because in that service I believe it was that service or another service I was reading on where there was a woman that was in a wheelchair but she said he's the lady if you stand out what chair you're going to die yeah if I were you I'd get out of that wheelchair so she had to use her what her reasoning to reason that that man's telling her the truth that the promise of God was right same way with you and me on anything we do we got to look at the word of God just like brother Robin said look see if it's the will of God motive and objective listen that woman wanted to get better anybody that can settle I couldn't sit in a wheelchair all my life I'd want to get up I'd want to find a way to get up that's why they went to these meetings they wanted to see the Healer hey man we know brother I'm wanting the Healer but you know what they went to the right fountain they went to the right Fountain to get their healing they reasoned that this guy had a what had a connection with God the Centurion reason he didn't know that maybe didn't know that Jesus was a messiah but he knew that guy had a power a connection that he'd never seen before he said you just speak the word he took all what his old reasoning that he said I'm a man of power he's a man of power if I tell somebody to go left they go left if he tells that disease to leave it'll leave now he just that was his reasoning that's the reasoning we've got to use memory reasoning goes together because what is our reasoning what is it depending on what we remember if you've never read this Bible you can't reason on it but if you read it you can take your memory see how these are all connected you take the memory of you reading John 3 16. and you can reason that that's right and you can say well God you said this and this is what I'm going to do I'm going to get out of my wheelchair or I'm going to get out of the situation that I'm in or I'm going to take virtue knowledge tempers patience and Godless and I'm going to live them I'm going to let it be a part of my life remember doors and doors you got to let God in that door everybody with me you gotta let God in that door you can keep that door shut and he'll never do nothing remember he just Knocks because the doorknob's on the inside all right memory reasoning let's go to conscious real quick the question was does every human being have a conscience listen to the the reason of this the reasoning of this the concept of conscious as commonly used in its moral sense is the inherent ability of every look every healthy human being to perceive what is right and what is wrong you're conscious right on the strength of this perception to control and monitor and evaluate and execute their actions let me read that one more time because it's good the inherent ability of every healthy human being to what to perceive what is right and what is wrong and in other words know what to do about it remember go by your conscience go with your conscious people say go with your conscience what is it you're taking your memory and your reasoning and you're putting it all together and you're kicking out the bad you're putting in the good for us but you know what we did when we were sinners we kicked all the good out we care about the Bible we don't care what the Bible said about what we could what we should do and shouldn't do we did it anyway because we had no what the fountain that was coming up was dirty water right so we just stayed dirty so it's perceived what is right and wrong and on the strength of this perception all right is everybody with me on the strength of this perception what do I perceive but you know that lady said sir I perceive that you're a prophet she used her memory which took her back to where mama taught her that there was going to be a messiah everybody with me wake up just a man everybody's with me he took her memory back to we know when you say no that means memory we know that Messiah will come and do this all right you with me her reasoning was he told her who she was how many husbands she had had and she wasn't living with her husband at that point her reasoning was that guy must be the Messiah and through her Consciousness she made that statement right I perceive that you're a prophet what are you saying brother wait you got to know and perceive that you're being told the truth Bible prophet's message preaching of the Gospel you got to perceive you got to what in your conscious you remember what your conscious you know somebody says you does your conscience bother you right you've heard it says doesn't your conscious bother you well they did in the bad things but now also in the good thing because people go what a church every Sunday I have to go to church every Sunday I don't have to go to church every Sunday to be a Christian I thought what Bible you're reading what Bible you reading your memory must be something wrong wrong you've got a flu stopped up somewhere that it's a requirement for Christians to go to church boy it got quite didn't get one amen out of that wow one more time it's a requirement for Christians to go to church part of the curriculum I want y'all and everybody on the internet that's watching in to just think about one minute were you better off in that wishy-washy stage are you better off now when you know that you know that you know right oh well everybody woke up now I mean really come on think about it because you it is like a storm over here on this side you didn't know where he was going to hit you from right but at least now with a moral compass a memory a reasoning conscious we're over here going this is for my good this is my battle this is for me to fight thank you Lord thank you that I'm heading toward a fiery furnace's hit hit seven times it's heated seven times more and I'm heading toward it and all it's going to do is burn my feathers off of my arms wow to me that's that moral part that now the water's pushing up the good water and we're getting it we're getting that part yeah I mean listen you hear as well as I do every day about how people are struggling out there in the world much less Christian I mean listen um Ann and them she knows one thing's for sure we're in the 21st century right Walmart's stack full of stuff we got so much stuff in our freezer well Mama might have to invite you over I'm not going to but she can invite you over there but she's got my stuff in the freezer we have to take and push it shut like this and lock it like this all of us do but there's people that when they had coveted during covet when the kids couldn't get to this that's the only meal they had yeah it's 21st century everybody with me yeah what a shame you know why politics politics you said no it's because it's all politics right a kid's not gonna get a meal because he can't go to school I thought going to school you learned yeah yeah when I went to school I knew I was going to get a meal but I had to pay well Mom and Daddy had to pay for it right and when I was going to school folks it was probably a quarter a week so what it may be five dollars a week or now or whatever it is but we got fed a meal same way with hair are we starving to death and have the greatest meal that's ever been give us whose fault is it hours yeah right it's our fault it's those poor kids parents fault that won't go to work to give them their food right right okay but you don't remember though that's the mentality that's the mentality I mean they're giving free meals now more than they ever have right free breakfast I got free breakfast but Mama cooked it let me tell you something I'm not an advocate of this but you kind of need to be home when your kids get ready to go to school because we were never sent to school with a Pop-Tart and a Coca-Cola right right Mama where are we ever that's why it's her fault I have to eat breakfast every day you know why she fed us breakfast every day about nine o'clock in the morning if I don't have something in this in this 55 gallon drum of mine I get sick I do I get swimmy-headed and all that because she fed his breakfast Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday no break on Saturday Saturday and Sunday she fixed us hot food dance Anna hot food mama she knows that we had toast breakfast we had toast bacon eggs grits oh best grits in the world grits and all that and and and like I said before that wasn't well I'm just don't feel like getting up today so I'm gonna just send my kids to school with a with a Pop-Tart and a glass of water if you do that's your business but or nothing well see that's what they're doing I'm heading to that now it's nothing they're depend able to feed their kids are we depending on no we got to work for this God's not going to bring it to you and just hand it to you he is not a social program this is a fight this is a fight to the death and we're either going to win or lose everybody with me so in our Consciousness we need to be conscious that we've got everything we need we've got a mama that'll cook us hot meals it's called the Holy Ghost amen everybody with me on that that was a little life lesson there but that's how we grew up we didn't grow up depending on somebody else to feed us right we got fed ourselves right we went to school and learned supposed to learn this that's the way it was before you learned how to do that to your kids so you can make enough money to wear this where you could feed them Three Square meals a day or ever a couple at least but man I tell you they want no government cheese program when we was growing up and all that stuff wasn't my what none of that no Daddy worked got the eggs we might have had chicken or two we had a pig we killed it Jerome bless his heart don't ever name your animals if you're going to kill them I still think about that boy now see it's in my memory it's just really in my conscience I'm gonna cry but don't name me animals if you're gonna eat them okay just just don't do that all right but what are we depending on are we depending on just said anywhere we want to and God's just going to throw it out there to us no way you're gonna fight for every inch like I said before brother you'll fight for every inch not mile not not foot not not yard you're gonna fight for every inch inch that's little my new things but where are we gonna get fed we're gonna get fed where the food is just like we knew when we got up no matter what morning it was mom was cooking breakfast for us getting breakfast not pop Pop-Tarts or or giving us a Snicker bars or whatever it is and sending us out the door with a uh we call them things you um the juice little juice thing you stick to juice box no we ate there we're at at school I'm at home and then we went to school right right there wasn't on this grabbing and going I don't know where that come from but bless your heart it was my memory coming back of the good old days but is that what we're doing now though we're depending on God to just give us everything he's got it there for us but we got to get it and in our conscience we got to know like that woman at the well she knew in her conscious we know when Messiah comes he'll do these things we know that when the Holy Spirit comes in the end time he's going to do this this is what he's going to do he's not going to do Wesley or do Luther or do even Pentecost back in the 1906. no he's going to do what present day word amen he's going to give us Manna fresh Manna every day and listen you got to know where it's at because remember even though God reigned matter down to the children of Israel millions of pounds it had to be yeah to feed two million people yeah yeah it had to be millions of pounds that he rained out of heaven they had to go pick it up they didn't wake up and open the freezing but man there's all my Mana for the day no you had to what come on Mom you had to pick that man up every day except on Sunday or on Saturday at that time so what are we doing we got to be conscious to know where God is and what God's doing amen everybody with me all right imagination what is the meaning of imagination the act of power of look forming a mental image oh boy of something not present to the senses are never before holy perceived in reality creative ability in other words I imagine that tomorrow I'm going to get up and I'm going to go do so and so how many times you said that and it never worked right um yeah or you stayed up half the night or half the day worrying about something that never came to pass the next day that's your imagination working because you know what it wasn't real to begin with it never was real never was real to begin with it was all fabricated in your brain hey man so God doesn't have an imagination he doesn't think of something and it don't come to pass when he thinks it comes to pass that's the difference in us and him he doesn't have to think about something and say well I better not do it that way I better do another way no when he thinks it it comes to pass so listen hold on a minute you said that's God we must have the mind of Christ to know that when Jesus four days before Lazarus died Saul Lazarus died brother Brown said he saw a vision four days before he saw Lazarus died amen that wasn't an imagination that was reality because it was a vision do you and I know that if we pick up the vision of this message come on now people if we pick up the true vision of this message it's not an imagination it's a reality because this message because look hold on a minute you go out to the Baptist Church and you listen to they're going to preach you A good sermon I believe they do try to listen they're trying to get people saved not just out there trying to fill in space they're trying to get people safe but they're doing it with an imaginary word the Holy Ghost never baptized anybody in the titles of father son Holy Ghost that's an imagination of man's mind that God thank God he winked at the ignorance of man to let them do that until the truth came but once the truth came what happened they did away with it no we're not having that so what did God do he sent us a prophet to line us back up to get us start started straight again and what'd they do they fell backwards we kept going they fell backwards in their denominations listen if a preacher gets up here and said hey it's all right the man three or four times it's all right to wear pants it's all right to wear makeup where's he getting that from he's getting that from an imagination of his own mind or the imagination of somebody that put in his mind because that didn't come from God so wouldn't listen this is not an imaginary message so we need to cast down this imagination that we can get it by not doing this or we can get it because of doing this and it's not the will of God and it's not the word of God right so the true meaning of imagination the act of power forming a mental image of something not present to the senses or never before holy perceived in reality in other words it never came to pass and you can formulate it in your mind how this is going to happen I'm going I know Regina just got a new car so she formulated in her mind she's going to get a car right she imagined driving a Porsche yeah see what I mean you see imagine getting in a Tesla new car smell no gas to pump I just kind of plug that thing in that's an imagination of her mind because she's never gonna get one right now you didn't right not this time okay but you and my we always imagined these things that never come to pass like a but you can't do that with the word of God you can't imagine that's why now listen let's come back and get the ship back together again that we do have to have the right words or the right doctrine of Daniel 70 weeks of the Seven Seals and of all these different doctrines that man has what put their own imagination in brother by Adam never came and gave us an imaginary message put your faith on that not that he spoke was imaginary it was the mind of God it was bringing us back to cast down reasoning cast down imagination everybody okay with that let's get one more and then we'll then we'll take communion we'll get to this sometime later on what's the meaning of affection a feeling of liking and caring a feeling of liking and cared for someone or something fondness a moderate feeling or emotion that don't sound like agape love sounds like filial love remember all the different loaves there's lust and then infection for you you know I can me and me and Anna can hug each other because we're brother and sister but but I can't hug sister Anna that well this sister out of that way right or into you why different kind of love different kind of feeling any motion is going to come into into view right everybody with me on that so the affection that we have in that in the listen the affection this is where it's a paradox the affection that we have in the center Realm Center realm the soul is agape love God the love of God right there what runs around in our memories in conscious affection imagination is filial love or lust or whatever else that is Eros and all those different other kind of loves that's not in your soul if you're not born again yeah it is all that failed oh really yes it is yeah yeah cause don't tell me that Satan has agape love he's a destroyer if he's in your soul you don't have agape love you you have feel your love listen there's plenty of people that got married love each other and would just live together for a hundred years and never have the new birth but that's only filial love that will not get them to heaven that will not get them to heaven and you know people and praise God that people can stay together a long life you know Mom and Dad me and June's everyone's around here 40 50 years together 60 years together that's good but without agape love in your life you're not going to heaven you're not going to make it sorry what brother Brown say the angel told him the only thing that will get you here is what perfect love which is agape love not feel your love because look filio love has ups and downs right right agape love does not have ups and downs the ups and downs you have is because of you the ups and downs I have is because of me it's because I do have feel your love around that agape love and we'll talk about that maybe next Sunday you understand what I'm saying there's a difference there's a big difference in filial love and agape love big difference and I don't want to break it down so much maybe later on but this affection we're talking about here is liking and caring now if you take that liking and carry though and you put agape love in that very Central Realm look how it enhances look how it enhances to feel your love listen you can never have agape love for your wife brother I'm gonna tell you that you only have agape love for God feel your love is between me and Jim everybody with me I can't have that same emotion to Jesus Christ because you know what he's number one she's number two he's number one she's number two so you have agape love which is the love of God in your soul then it works its way out and we'll get to this later on everybody stand our feet uh all these memory reason conscious affection imagination they all are intertwined with each other and they're all in that middle Realm of you everybody with me so now if you're born again if you're born again today you have agape love in your soul it's locked in there you're sealed until the day of your Redemption you're going to you you're not just going to heaven you're bride I mean it's gonna be a lot of people not bright in heaven but you're going to be bride and you're going to have agape love and and somewhere in there even if you have to go by the grave that's going to what Break Forth and change this thing right because the love of God listen the love of God is what changes your body because he loved you so much he died in his to make sure you didn't have to and yours oh praise God what a what a Plan of Redemption that we is to me it's totally in a human being that's why most human beings can't fathom how that God that didn't need nobody that was eternal that didn't even uh need a molecule to Breathe by he decided to come down here and decided to die for me and you and go through the heartaches and trials that we went through and grew up as a man from a baby to a man and then died on a cross and then came back and now that's the mystery they don't know where he's at now but we know the mystery the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory let's bow our heads the Lord thank you for this day that you give us we appreciate the time that we have Lord now as we go into another part of the service Lord the communion I pray that you sanctify us Lord for this journey father forgive us of our mistakes and sins Lord that we do against you Lord Lord help us to be more like you give us Lord and let that agape love just move its way to the outside Lord let us not keep it bottled up Lord let us be able to show we know the world we know the world for a fact shows the the worst kind of love Is Just sloppy and they whatever they want to do in the world it just it's just not good but Lord you gave us agape love the love of God that shed abroad in our hearts not to be where we go out and commit adultery every day or we go out and sin like that when our body every day Lord you've given us a moral compass you give us something to what you give us something to live by these five senses can be lived right or it can be lived they can be lived wrong lord it's just a choice that we make as a free moral agent we didn't get to read that Lord but the prophet of God tells us we're we're free moral agents even after we're born again so our Free Will agency will tell whether we can climb this ladder that Jacob saw in his vision of angels ascending and descending up into heaven that the statue of perfect man can be lived a living breathing instrumentality of God that's what the prophet told us and I believe that was you talking to us telling us that Lord I pray you should be with us in The Firm of the service be the ones Lord I think maybe they're probably on their way back from from Camp Lord I pray that you give them traveling mercies and be with them Lord and keep them safe be with us and further with this service Lord in Jesus name we pray amen we'll read we'll start there again own next Sunday brother Louise will be speaking this coming Wednesday night and I hope that helps us to help us to realize oh because listen when we there's one thing for sure when we when we go through life brother Dale's not right there with us the whole time all right he's not right there beside of us ever you know but now what he spoke is what he preached is yeah amen that's what Julie crafts was telling us the other day he said you know we he says she said sometimes we we see ourselves quoting what brother was quoted from the pulpit from you from years ago you hear us quoting that to other people well that's not brother Dale physically being there but that if the words he spoke were eternal life then that's what was standing there right that's why we're brother Branham the words he was speaking to us was eternal life that's why we speak it brother John that's why we have confidence in 1100 sermons I can pull up in this in this computer I can pull up something that brother Branham said and have confidence that that's what God Said right if you don't then you need to hit the altar we all do you need to have confidence in something but I have confidence that the words right I was wrong at one time right against the word of God contrary but then when he brought Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost said hey read them 1100 sermons again read the Bible again with a different set of eyes with a different what with a different memory different reasoning different conscious different affection the Bible says set your what affection on things above not down here this can get into all kind of it's just gooey down here everybody wants that free love and you know you can just do this and do that and why it don't matter you do it's just your old body yeah it's just your body but it's controlled by that thing deep down inside of you amen because the things I used to do I do them no more things I used to do I do them no more why because you've been changed I've been changed I'm a new creation a brand new man why that man is one that's talking to us now that man's the one that's pushing the fountain up pushing the water up and now our Fountain is what pure water let's go into communion First Corinthians 11 if you want to read with me for I have received with the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that's the same night that's Lord Jesus the same night excuse me in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cut when he had stopped he said this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes you know you look back up there and say in remembrance of me those disciples remembered that night and when Jesus came back onto that Pentecost and filled them with the Holy Ghost the Bible says they broke bread in other words they took communion a lot they remembered that night he said you'll remember what you've done you don't probably don't know what you're doing now but you'll remember what you've done this night and this is a new testament in my beloved in other words your new testament disciples you're not Old Testament disciples anymore you're new when I come back on the day of Pentecost it's a new testament it's a new it's a new way of doing things not like it was before not the old way made over either the New Testament for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworldly he doesn't drink contamination to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many or weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him mean at home that you come out together into the condemnation and the rest will I sit in order when I come the Corinthians were just eating food and drinking and getting drunk at the communion table that's why Paul said don't do that you go eat at home you're not gonna do that in a sanctuary this is sacred this is something that we set aside from just eating and drinking you can go do that at home if you want to but don't do it here that's what he was saying and the rest will I set an order when I come so when he came back to Corinth II Corinthians they had to straighten out so I took the word to straighten them out took a preacher amen so let's tell you just for a moment and pray one for the other and just remember our pastor different ones Lord that's going through different situations Lord that you'll be with them we ask you blessings Lord and further in this service in Jesus name we pray amen he took bread and blessed it dear Lord Jesus thank you for this bread we know it's been made with holy hands and Lord it's just a simple recipe father so I pray that that simple recipe will now go into our hearts Lord and it will become part of us that this simple recipe Lord not something complicated or but it's a simple gospel that believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved Lord I pray that you should save all of us father forgive us of our sin save us from ourself in Jesus name we pray amen yeah I won't be saved from me amen get saved from herself y'all excuse me pray for my my voice my throat it's just tickles I don't have any kind of junk in it just tickling I like when brother Branham went to uh he's somewhere he went for an examination and examined his his throat he's wondering why his throat was so scratchy and the doctor told him said well you got calluses on your on your vocal cords he said praise God he said Lord let me have some more if I'm gonna do it for you let me have some more of those I mean if I'm gonna have calluses you might as well have me either on my knees or in my mouth one of the two dear Lord Jesus this wine Lord has also been made with holy hands it's been prepared in a way Lord that it gets stronger and stronger just as your word every Sunday every Wednesday every time we listen to a tape Lord or our fellowship around you Lord the word of God gets stronger Lord I pray that you'll just be with us and sanctify us for this journey that we're on in Jesus name we pray amen foreign by the river I'll rest knee the evergreen tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's Glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected boy you feel that way sometimes huh and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look what we go back to Calvary okay and what he did for us there nothing compared to what we're going through the strength to go on come morning I'll walk when it's all over and done with be the greenest green you've ever seen be the bluest blue skies you've ever seen it'll be the greatest thing you just I has not seen we don't we just don't know we go outside and we look at that dreary I know we need rain but you look at that dreary day but I'll promise you right above that cloud sunshine right above that cloud of sunshine there's a layer that may darken you every once in a while but there's a sun that's shining if you just get yourself Above the Clouds that's right get up above listen it's always Shining you say no it's dark no if you just keep following the sun it just stays daylight all the way around the world you just keep going with it you just keep following the sunshine that's what we do now we follow the sunlight of the word of God the gospel what of your salvation but let's don't be children anymore let's grow up with god let's grow up and get this thing get us get us out of here we got to get out of here we can't we just and it's okay you know we've we we we love each other and that's okay and that's fine but could it be just feel your love we'll find out one day you'll find out one day if it was just filial love because agape love can stand correction Agape Love is a judge agape love is not some sloppy um like we think about it down here no it's far above 10 000 times more than we've got here brother Branham I love my wife well I love my wife there he said you'll love the whole place ten thousand times more than you love and we can't fathom that I mean brother John can can you imagine loving sister Alicia 10 000 times more than you do now well you will and you know what you'll love me too ten thousand times more boy a lot of people that's going to be hard for him today everybody ready all right let's take well put my Bible up and I'm not done yet good grief yeah I said good grief they called me Charlie Brown in Ohio because I say good grief all the time I don't have a bald head yet though all right you ready and John that's what I needed that wine yes it will as soon as I get finished coughing except for being into this is John 12 John 13 verse 2. if you want to follow along and suffer being suffer being ended the devil having now put in the Heart of Jesus heart in his soul because because God wasn't there Judah stepped I mean Satan stepped in and did what he was going to do all right put in the heart of Judas this carrot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand and that it was come from God and went to God he rises from supper laid aside His Garment and took a towel and girded himself we're going to get back to that scripture right there when he says that he was come from God and he went to God that's what your soul is now if you're born again it didn't come from your mom and daddy it came from God and it's going back to God because it is God if you're not you know what it's going to come from the devil go back to the devil one of the two all right but we'll get to that because you know what that's what's going to shine when this thing starts when we start going up this statue of perfect man that's what's going to shine that came from God your normal human self contrary to God did not come with that in it you had to be born again and by the new birth he could form these virtues inside of you so it came from God and it's going back to God all right so we'll get to that later on maybe a couple more years he rises from supper and lay decided His Garment took a towel and girded himself after that he pouredth water into a basement and began to wash the disciples feet and to wiped in with the towel over with he was girded then cometh heed of Simon Peter Peter said unto him Lord you wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter thank God he could see in the future Peter I see Satan's sifting you as saying so I prayed for you he prayed for us too John 17 he said I pray for them Lord that I have chosen that's us Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said Lord not only in my feet not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that is washed need not safe to wash his feet but his clean ever wet and you are not all clean you are clean but not all for he knew who would betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken His Garment and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you he's asking him a question you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord see that's the whole thing if you don't wash feet that means you're saying yourself you've asserted yourself above the person that's standing and sitting there washing feet that's why he said you won't have no part with me because you don't put yourself way up here that you're better than that person washing feet my and that was God washing the people's feet that was God that wasn't a second person of a trinity that was God washing feet God washed those dirty feet of those people knowing one of them was the devil hmm so he also called Judas his friend too yeah remember in the garden Judas friend what are you doing here friend hmm if I then you Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy happy are you if you do them let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for this day that you give us for this time of communion Lord as we remember back even when we're singing the song that they raised you above Earth and put you on a cross and you hung there for hours for my sin you had told them just a few days before that or the day before that that that was what was going to happen and they didn't believe you and you went ahead and gave them communion washed their feet told Judas to go do what he was supposed to do but you had me on your mind me on your mind when you were on that cross Lord now not that just I can see you on the cross I see an empty cross I see an empty tomb but I see a soul that's filled with the Holy Ghost that used to be empty for years our soul as the song says was as black as night but Darkness has taken flight we were Sinners Lord and by your grace in my free moral agency come together that the Bible says Heaven and Earth has kissed Lord you brought down the Holy Ghost by representation and burn out that old nature and put you inside thank you Lord I hope we all realize that we are the luckiest people in the world we're chosen elected that we are you made manifest on this Earth again Lord and that we have now no limitations death has no dominion over us in the end time father I pray that you'd be with us now take care of us in the furthermore this service as we go to foot washing that you'll bless each one Lord that's here Lord give us all the refilling of the Holy Ghost this week Lord that you'll touch us now be your brother Louise this coming Wednesday night Lord that you'll touch his mind Lord and give us something from you father just bless each one now and be with the ones that are traveling on the highways bringing the youth back that Lord you will protect them on the highways and give them Lord safe travel in Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed as ladies go downstairs [Music]
