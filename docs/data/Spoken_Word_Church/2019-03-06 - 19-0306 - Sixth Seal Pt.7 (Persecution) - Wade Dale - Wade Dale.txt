seal you're gonna talk tonight we're gonna talk about persecution we're gonna go to Revelation six again and I want us to we're gonna kind of personalize a little bit because this seal and will will speak on it just a few minutes but I want you to just kind of file it in the back of your mind do you know what this seal is this is these change seal now we took a change in the fourth seal and went in the rapture we know that but underneath that is that thunder that we're looking for because in the sixth seal remember you laugh it back under we got the sixth seal has to break to us and that sixth seal that breaks to us is our body change so this is the that to me this is important this is your body change now it's changed the world and it's changed things it changed nature it's change 144,000 it changed a lot of things we're going to talk about a little bit tonight but it's going to change us but before it changes us we're gonna have to go through a little bit of persecution alright so the Bible tells us that all that live godly in christ shall suffer persecution alright so but we're gonna add a little bit to that not dad to the word but we're gonna kind of expound on that a little bit so let's read revelation 6 verse 12 let's go to the Lord in prayer generally father we thank you tonight for giving us an opportunity to come in the middle of the week and to Talk About You Father we know that Satan hates us the demons hate us but you love us and graters either send us and eat us in the world there's not a thing can stand before you Lord you're you're the king you're our husband you're our lover lords you did all the things for this bride you protected us Lord now I pray that you would just let this word soak down inside of a Florida and let it be lived the prophet of God told us that's the thunder of God would be thousands of lived voices that's the best thunder you can have is to is to not just be able to speak the word but to live it and Lord we pray that you just help us to do that Lord even though if we have to go through persecution so be it for us to get out of here because this world at this point is not our home father just be with each one of us be with the sick be with the ones that are not here Lord be with the ones that are having problems in their life we pray this you just you're the Prince of Peace that's what you said you said lay all your burdens on me so I'm want to lay all my burdens on you Lord code you told us to and clear my mind and clear my heart from this building all the way back for my flight tomorrow to leave out and to go over there and try to tell the people a little more about you Lord I'm taking this church with me Lord I'm taking Lord all the people that are here that support this church operation and all the other support that they give us in prayers and the things lowered up Lord of life that you have give us we're just one big family Lord now I pray Lord that this family will bind together and pray that everything will go well for your honor and glory not for us but for you father bless us and take care of us be with my wife Lourdes you'll be a couple of weeks they're being off without me

several ones have already been to the phillipines and and done a work Lord we pray that we just come right in behind them Lord and just lift the people up also father just be with us now and the further man this service blesses in Jesus name Amen and I beheld when he opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid himself in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand you may be exceeding the Lord as a blessing to the reading the word don t reach over in Kurt that cut the fan on please this kind of stuff you up here a little bit hot but thank the Lord for the reading of the word and we've come into this sixth seal now we know this a tribulation seals of tribulation period but I was thinking today there in revelation 6 or in Revelations 4 when the bride goes up in the rapture when it says after just okay let Aaron Hale let Aaron handle it he might let the maintenance director take over put your safety glasses on hardhat safe goodbye sir okay tilt oh hey tilt um cheese anyway but I was thinking about this and when revelations for one says after these things we go up so after the church ages we go up in Revelations for one we're not seeing revelations 19 now that is that is true has to be because we're not here on this physical earth during that time of 5:3 whatever the whatever the six seven eight nine it's like a brother Center sent a message online and God bless you brother field if you're watching in tonight I made a statement that the that the woes was the second world war but in the chronological order the scripture it looks like it doesn't happen happen yet but you have to remember when you talk about scripture and prophecy it's broad and it is spiritual but it also that whoa brother Brown said the three woes of the three world wars so you can't get away from that first well what's the first world war ii whoa what's the second world war and the third woe is going to be the one coming which would be the third world war war the war that will end all wars that we know of on the face of the earth but you have to look and see that though in chronological order sometimes it doesn't look right but it took a prophet to pull those pieces out and put them together so that we can understand what the Bible says because we wouldn't even know what a war was if it wasn't been for the Prophet and man I mean people have presumed and all these different things but we're brother Graham said the three woes with the three wars to me it just made it plain it just made it plain what the what the walls were and how that they held that first woe because that was a war to end all wars World War one like brother Dale was talking about it they nobody knows why it ended on November the 11th at the 11th nobody knows that will be angel did brother Branham knew what was going on he knew that we'll stop that war because they were getting ready to come out with a mustard gas if you'll read all that World War one was a horrible war because there was no and I know all war is horrible but World War two they kind of had a little bit of contract between we're not going to use this great big thing or than this but World War one there was no contract they was just getting ready to unleash everything on the people because there was no United Nations there was no control of any other country so it was going to be probably the war that would break out now they didn't have nuclear at the time but they could have destroyed a lot of places but what I'm saying is all this though revelation 6 when that sixth seal opens we know we're not here but that six seal opens because of you and me you said no it's the two prophets I know that but the two prophets are mute until we leave this place the two prophets are not even anointed at this moment to do anything until the blindness is lifted off of the of the Jew and it's always going to be there until we leave so this is all going to happen because of me and you because of the bride of Jesus Christ that's how important it is for us to get these things get them right and get out of here get out of the way and let God do what he's going to do alright but this is going to take though a little bit of persecution it's going to take you know think back even we were talking about the fourth seal it's obvious and if you're not if you haven't had a nature change you're not born again you must know that your old nature is not just hid it's dead you don't have that nature anymore if you still have that same nature now sure listen folks don't kid yourself my brother Dale said once he got born again he never drank a beer in his life hated beer but see somebody drinking a beer now you know you look over and you go you know I mean it wise it's in your brain though it's not in your heart there's no way you'd walk over there and do it now the one that was there that made you do it to start with he's dead but he can still play in that in that memories and conscience affection imagination he can play in that realm but what happens remember he played in that room when we were growing up and going through the things but what happened was when we brought Lewis let's have a party tonight brother Louisa died I got the drink so you know that's what it was you just went and did it why because there was the nature and there to do it but see that nature is gone now there's no way you would do that there's no way you would pick that up anymore the things I used to do I do them no more now it doesn't mean that you're not bothered with them but in this sixth seal purging you and I are gonna have to come to a sixth seal purging of that metal man to know that that middle man that memories and conservation imagination is just what it is memory reasoning conscious effects and imagination contrary to God's still contrary to God but what's inside of the inside of that person there's the real you the nature that it's not even you anymore it's God but let God work out to destroy those little ice you might say I've been reading back through numbers and Deuteronomy and all that man you get into that land and there's the hip dice and a high bias and the Jabba sites and all these other ice that Joshua had to deal with it wasn't just Joshua walked in and said Paul dead no he had to fight but you know what Rahab made an outstanding statement she must have heard among the community that the community said we were whipped when y'all cross the Jordan in other words we might have had some spies looking around we had the satellite up and the image showed us the sea just opened up and y'all walked right across didn't even get your feet muddy hey she said we were whipped when y'all did that but now did Josh win them know it no they didn't know it they had to still walk around Jericho in other words one of my saying you still gotta live your life you still gotta listen to the preacher you still gotta around your Jericho and then not take a bomb and blow it or blow it away speak to it that's what we got to come now into speaking condition in this sixth seal because if you're going to have persecution I say if you're asking if not me the persecution and I'll read you some quotes and I I don't know brother Jose here or not but I thank God he sent me a bunch of clothes and I had forgot that he sent them to me about persecution what brother Brown said we're gonna read them they're in the very back side of your of your paper that I gave you and it'll be some quotes that that brother Brown said thus that the Lord you're gonna there's something there's gonna be a boycott there's going to be it's going to be a troubling time but but everybody's on own to this third pull business which is okay but everybody's got the third pull being you know brother I'm coming back in tents and blah blah all that stuff brother Brown said the third pulls opening of the word the third pull is now laying dormant the Prophet said we're going to read it it's right there in front of you it's laying dormant we don't need it right now in that aspect we need the opening of the word but we don't need a pork chop on our plate we don't need God to fill the gas up now they do in other countries like we were talking before in other countries and let me just be real some of you to spend other countries they have more faith than we do they just have a faith that like brother Reed told brother Dale said brother Dale we don't have a CBS on every corner if our kids have a toothache we may have a little remedy that we give them an herb or something but we don't have a CBS to run and get the Ambus all or whatever it is that we just readily probably still have in our cabinet right now they don't have that so they have to have a certain degree of faith the brothers in the word brother Lewis work they had to have a certain amount of faith just to buy oil they couldn't buy oil to go in the so God supply them the only God supply them the oil okay he'll supply your needs now he didn't apply the oil in a brand new car he put the oil in the old car but the old truck got you there then it I mean it did what it was supposed to do you see what I'm saying with us you and I it's not gonna be I don't believe it's gonna be everything we thought it is but it's going to be some things that we need to be prepared for just in case we don't need to be I mean you know you can be a prepper if you want to and we put up stuff and you put up a little bit if you want to and and that's okay but there's gonna look at all now now when we did that back in the 70s look what happened there was no line of communication like cell phones listen I know why the cell phone come into be you can't hide nothing and everybody has a cell phone everybody how many times have you lost your cell phone you get a sick or feeling that if somebody would have stole your car out in the parking lot right a man you go and you go to digging and you don't care what else happens you got to find that phone well you know what that someone is right it's a GPS it has a receiver my scanner that I use for my postal service job it tells me exactly if I put the package on the porch or if I deliver it into their box it's within three or four feet accuracy and they can tell me how many times I backed up and if I sit still for ten minutes it sends an alarm a lot alarm to the post office that I haven't moved in ten minutes so if I stop and talk to some of my beekeeping friends I'm overdoing the scanner like this I'm taking my lunch break they just happened to be on my route sorry but anyway but that's the truth but you see but what I'm saying is now all the things that we thought we could do and do the you know do the sniper thing where the ghillie suit and you know we hide so nobody find us if you've got any kind of electronics on you hold you watch it oh the government just knew that he raised his hand it's in our watches now iPhone iPhone yeah I phone you said well I sell them we'll get rid of mine now they'll know what I'm saying is they're gonna know where you are they already know where we are they already know what we're what we stand for it's just one day they're gonna come in and say you can't do that anymore you just can't do that anymore unless you sign this paper right here now read where brother Brown said that some people will sign the paper and go right in why because they think you know what they think what will to keep my doors open and to keep my congregation coming in and to keep getting my tithe no to keep getting my to keep everything going I'm gonna sign this paper won't hurt anything that's what brother Brown said they'll do thinking that they can serve God underneath that but they're not gonna be able to do that and a real true son and daughter of God won't do it anyway we cannot yield to that that's where the persecution is going to be but don't worry about it they know everything about us man just look everybody knows everything about everything all the time so who we got depend on now we need to depend on God alone because Louise was talking about it Wednesday night you know Ellie I mean yeah Ellie's are and in Elijah Elijah is like open my servants eyes but what did he last you do Elijah walked into the camp of the people that were trying to find him and said who you looking for right who you looking for what we're looking for mark action Ralph and it's him standing there we're looking for Elijah God had changed their eyesight and that's what he's going to do but you're not gonna have to depend on God to do that because Elijah didn't depend on himself he just walked right in and dependent on God to change their eyesight because remember he changed it so much that Elijah I think he went got all the all the good guys and brought them into the camp wreath or took the bad guys into the good camp and God opened their eyes and they just laid there they just laid their weapons down what they walked right into I mean my heavens you're walking into a camp of your enemy same way with you and I saying wave Jesus and Paul and and all those that Jesus you know they were getting ready to stone him and throw him off a cliff and the Bible says he was he disappeared now he didn't disappear he was still there God just changed their eyesight so that he could walk right down through the through the crowd and they go oh that's Joel that's Joe that's John yeah just let him go see same way with you and I but you and I are dependency then it's got to be on guard to do that not brother down not me not william branham he's not here we got a pending on guard God's the one that's gonna take us out of this do not put your dependency on a man except that was not there because if you put your dependency on that man you'll never fail amen so the sixth seal then let's look at verse number one is a tribulation seal with no Tribulation Period and God is going to deal with Israel as a nation you and I are already gone now what I want you to see is the rest that we what we talked about tonight has happened or will be happening because you and I came to a place to take a body change a resurrection and a rapture so we're completely out of the way when this happens but that sixth seal has to come real to you too Cheng's you that's the change seal I want you to get that in your mind that six seals somewhere inside that seal something where that thunder is going to ring out that I have been changed my total nature has been changed to where payment listen when we walk into this world I was telling you this Sunday we walk into this world this is a world of death doesn't matter if you're a Christian now just lay it on the table this is a world of death amen you were born to die in your flesh you were born to die now what's gonna happen though we're same dimension but now watch when Jesus stepped out of the tomb he had a change buddy it was glorified now the world went right on like they like they were actually you know what they did they said no Jesus they took his body out and they throwed it out in the desert or they buried it or eat it see all the story same thing is gonna happen to us but when Jesus walked out what I'm saying is when Jesus walked out it wasn't that the whole world just collapsed it kept right on going same way with you and I when we take a body change it the world's going to keep on going actually several years later but these things are going to happen to cause the Tribulation Period right after we leave or even right at the point in time we all know one thing's for sure there were several earthquakes at the resurrection we know one thing's for sure that California is gonna have to sink to cause this thing to to get into turmoil and you can we can sit here and draw charts and read quotes and you I'm just telling you you better be ready if California sinks while we're here to me it's done and over with there's no running back to mom and daddy and there's no running - brother day on this road no running to God it's over the Gentile doors somewhere in there is gonna be shut cuz that's what's going to call you and I are it's kind of a paradox is thinking the other day you and I are whole holding off the wrath of God but because we're he leave it brings the wrath of God and there's a pre-tribulation happening now all the way around everywhere because what Satan still what he still sees you in your flesh body see this is what Satan's got he's got that one last mark which is this guy even with Jesus he'd say if you be if you be the Son of God do this if you be this even Satan said it Almighty God he was so veiled in human flesh until Satan didn't believe who he was he knew there was a power inside that man absolutely but if you be if you be if what he was he was telling him what the word said but what did Jesus do he didn't perform some great miracle he said it is written it is written it is written and that's what you and I are gonna come to Satan it's already written and our wing gotta write it it's already written all right and that's what's so great is what we're looking for to get us out of here is already here it's already in the Word of God it's already in the prophets message it's already here it's already inside of you amen because literally the world changed Helen today of Pentecost you had Jesus standing on earth for 30-something years he was the only one that was eternal in his soul on the whole face of the earth and then all of a sudden when he comes back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the Holy Ghost there's a hundred and twenty eternal people walking on the face of the earth and then 3,000 the next day or at the same time the 3,000 became eternal people walking on the face of the earth what it's what a change but you know what it didn't bother a lot of people 90% of the world just kept right on going didn't bother him one bit oh yeah they made their little accusations and all this they're drunk their Pentecost they're drunk the Jesus camp we can't find his body all they eat it he said eat my flesh and dream blood he said they saw what he just eat they eat the body so you see that same thing going to do with us they gonna make excuses about things so let's just continue on here number two when we know that this six seal is the judgment seal and we were talking last Sunday you your judgment praise the Lord is over as far as you going you will take a body change somewhere if you're born again your body is going to have to go through a change whether it be you to lay it down into the earth and we bury it into the earth but the Bible says we bury it in corruption but we raised it in in corruption it will not be corrupt twice amen it will not be corrupt twice you might have to deal with it like you're dealing with it now but you will never have to deal with it again now some of us feel like we get old twice but you know what that's just not so you will not get old twice you're I hope we see that and I'm I'm not I don't make light of people but but we're we're closer to our eternal 20-year old person even us younger ones if you get born again you're right there at that door that you're never gonna have to get old children don't worry do not worry you think oh I'm gonna miss so much if I don't get married have kids have a car where's your son have a car that boy got a car yeah house payment boy what is that be happy you don't have to do that my kids one time this winds did not take my time my kids one time they want to know who died why in the world do you make all these rules and we got to go buy all this in your house it's your house this is my castle Ida and I thought I told them so I said okay I'll tell you what you can do it you can be the leader you can be the king you can be the I'll do whatever you tell me to do but there's a few things you got to do that I do you got to go to work 8:00 to 5:00 Monday through whenever and when you bring the money in you got to give part of it to me cuz I'm gonna go Josh there's my son back there Josh you need to make the house payment this month what huh oh wait a minute the power bills due oh my cellphone bills due oh my car needs four tires oh oh I need something to eat I got some new shoes I said if you can provide all that you the daddy you can tell me whatever to do it in this house cause it will become yours but since you don't but since you don't my way or the highway well the debt won't mind he said his kids in you too two numbers 18 and 30 when you get 18 you got 38 days to leave I don't mind them staying my house they know but you know I said but that's the same way that we are we what we say well our kids it's all doom and gloom that's not doom and gloom if you look at the right way there's a lot of horrible things kids that you are being held away from that we keep you sheltered that you're gonna realize maybe one day if time does continue on you're gonna go whoa I don't know if I want to do this or not so you know so you understand what I'm saying teacher kids teach your kids that even though we may be heading toward a persecution that God is going to take care of us God's not going to leave us alone they're gonna leave a bunch of kids running around and we going in a rapture I just don't believe God's gonna do that I believe God's gonna take our kids and if they come to the age of accountability then now that's a different story they're gonna have to have it for their self but then you as you teach them and mold them all the way up teach them to be born again teach them the things to do and and just like the Bible says when they're older I had to wait till I was older because I had a hard head but when they're older they'll come back just live the life performance all you can do I mean but same way with this and we start talking about persecution and tribulation children don't be scared God is gonna take care of you I promise you it's thus saith the Lord it's thus that the eternal God that created everything you're standing on he will take care of you he promised it if he promised it you're right if you promised him if he promised it he'll do it so he'll take care of you do not worry do not worry worry brings fear fear brings torment do not do that but as we do speak on these things please remember teach your kids look God's gonna take care of us we're a family got listen God didn't God didn't give you a family not to take care of he gave you that family to nurture and take care of take care of that family and teach them the ways of the Lord teach them that God's gonna protect us teach them that God's already here to provide our needs not that he's coming and not that we're trying to we're trying to work something up no we he's in their everyday life he goes to school with him he goes in the you know he goes to he goes through puberty with him God went through puberty you know that don't you yeah Jesus went through puberty cuz he was a boy and he became a man all right there buddy okay with that he was a human so he understands that okay so now let's read if everybody's okay the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word so whatever that seal opens is going to be judgment but God's already judged you now let's be careful with that let's don't go all the way over to the other side and say well I'm I'm I don't have to do anything no there's still things you gotta do read your Bible pray come to church do the things that you're supposed to do because remember you put God first then the Bible say seek ye first the kingdom of God and then all these other things to be added to you all right so if you're having problems in your life you know what when I start having problems in my life I come to church cuz I want to get rid of them problems I didn't want them no more hey man I don't like trouble I don't like persecution but that's okay you got to look at the promise people God has got to do what he's already said he's gonna do hey man so let's look let's read Isaiah we read this last Sunday but Isaiah even tells us about the tribulation but now listen let me say one more time teach your kids get born again they'll get a body change and they'll leave this place you don't have to worry about none of this sure we all we all think we all say we the only people's got problem right your problems are the bad as mine who's judging how you for the day of the Lord is at hand they shall come as of destruction from the almighty therefore show all hands be fainting every man's heart shall melt you know why God put this in the word to judge the people it's gonna stay here not you it's not you that's not you that's for the people that turned the grace of God down and they're still here then God has to tell them what's going to happen he's a just God so he even has to tell the devil he tells the devil what he's gonna do he doesn't hope this in' therefore shall all hens be fainting every man's heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pains and song shall take hold to them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it because remember the sixth seal purging will read it to me it's a three-fold manner but the earth has to be purged also it's the third one the earth this literal earth has to go through a purging all right for the stars of heaven and constellation there shall not give their light the Sun shall be darkened and is going forth in the moon shall not cause their light to shine and I will punish the world for their evil this is gonna be a worldwide punishment it's not just going to happen to the United States that this time it's gonna be worldwide all right and I will punish the world for their evil in the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible the man the brother Brom tells us in the sixth seal he says see they're just exactly eyes they saw the same thing that Jesus spoke up that the Seventh Seal revealed who was the Seventh Seal Jesus Jesus is the Seventh Seal thereby okay with that Jesus says the seventh seal because six seals finishes everything that's why the seventh seal silent there's nothing going on there's it's all done brother Branham talks about we'll talk about it later it's the end it's the end of the struggling world the end of all things it's the end when the seventh seal came to you and gave you the new birth that was an end of your own nature that was the end of the old you you became a new creation or a new creature in Christ amen that's the Tribulation Period this sixth seal yes he was a prophet and the Word of God was made known to him he's talking about Isaiah alright let's go to the remnant just for a second then we'll get into these into this a few comments here let's go to number four excuse me what is a remnant the piece that's cut left some kind of good same kind of goods your ten what he's saying if you lay out up if you lay out a piece of goods you bought your material all right and if you're gonna cut out this piece of paper that's gonna be the one you you're gonna you're keying on this go this is going to make your shirt or whatever it's going to make but that doesn't exclude the remnant it's the same material as this it's just used different right it's just used different this is the bride of Jesus Christ he has cut us out of the cloth the remnant the foolish virgin they're virgins so they're not drunkards and whoremongers no they're trying to live a good life they're trying to live a Christian life they're trying to do the best they can it's just it like what brother Branham says the gospel never was preached totally tool or something happened that they couldn't get born again okay but it's the same material we're not going to walk into listen if you've got an idea and and let me put this in them you know we are the bride of Jesus Christ were the most special people on the face of the earth beside Jesus himself he said that he said that and we're in the seventh church age and were the most important people on the face of the earth to God right now right but we are no better than that man walking out on the street even brother Ram told us he's no different than us in a drunk you've got the new birth he don't that's the only thing he made a choice you made a choice okay so we're not gonna go to the foolish virgins and say oh you were just you were just the material no you won't be there if that's your attitude right but because this remnant is that remnant is the same cloth but what about if this can tell this about what they missed about the material because you listen you and I are gonna be the word made flesh you and I are already the word made flesh but when we get the glorified body and we get over on in the Millenium and all these other things we're not gonna just sit around and talk about right gene you know heard of things do you mind talk about no we're gonna have a godly mind but we're not going to be zombies where I'm gonna just be sitting there no we're gonna be what our mind is going to be so expanded that we don't need a Bible we are the Bible we can tell people about Abraham you know what if we can't remember about Abraham luisa go Abraham there is I'll tell you what happened when I was here I wonder what a logic allowed you glad to commit there's a lot you travel like a pilot right so if you need to talk to somebody no distance what wonderful is that how wonderful is that that we're so limited now it's why I'm telling you is why I'm trying to wind us into that six seal the sixth seal is just when we walk on this earth with a glorified body Nature has to fall this nature Kate standing it brother branham preached birth pains and we'll get into that when I come back but this world is in birth pains you've already been birthed you've already had your birth pains you've already been birthed by the by the Word of God it's this earth that when this thing gets birth this thing's gonna get birth because what happened is is Adam fell in this and that fell the ball call her right it's God business where he lays the pattern he cuts her right out now you know why he does that you got to go back to predestination in foreknowledge you got to go to foreknowledge that this part of the that this part of the material went all the way so let's don't forget and it's not predestination like God said all right that's the way it is remember that I said that's what the man said that would be you'd be in a tube and God just pull you through tube no he saw your choice therefore he could put the pattern right where he needed to put it say rhe destination by foreknowledge you can never go wrong you just keep it as predestinate it's my brother Brian would always say he said it's not a good word to use in the crowd why he'd have time to explain that is by foreknowledge but thank God he did pick some sermons that he explained this but really didn't have to Ephesians says foreknowledge of God those who afford new he did predestinate the Bible has always said that it just took a property to bring putting pieces for put it together for us take the pieces and put it together so the rest of this is Calico is just as good as calicoes address but it's God's election God elects his church God predestination Church God for ordained that foreknowledge ordain his church and he takes that church out so what's he doing he's cutting it out he's gonna take the church or the bride he means that the bride and the remnants left to go through the tribulation why they weren't part of the original bride the bride shirt or the bride whatever you want to call it let's say the bride dress but the remnants going to go through the tribulation period to be purged their persecution is going to continue on ours will stop I promise you the Bible it'll stop but there's will continue on into the tribulation period and then when they pass away there's going to stay dead a thousand years so they're purging is going to continue while we're in the Millennium and we're walking on the earth and we're having a good time with 144,000 and the fifth seal Jew and what more they're still going to be dead they're going to be in a dimension somewhere and they're gonna have to wait until the second resurrection they'll come up that white throne I read it to you last Sunday where they will be judged for what their works I don't want to be judged I don't ever want to stand before God with any work that I did yes or no you've got to go start you been in church ever since she's a kid they don't mean one thing to God I don't mean nothing going so I'll take what his work said I'll hide myself behind his word and then if if brother Branham said he said if God had to judge Jesus then he's got to judge me and if there's no judgment in Jesus he took all the judgment then there's none even me so that's read through read is why that's what I'll take I'll take it every time and that's where many Bible scholars get mixed up thinking the bride goes through the tribulation because remember you just keep going through you can see that this this brother here had two bride in heaven the dragon spurt and water to make war with the bride and 144,000 which is the bride stand on mountain now this is another brother talking not brother branham no no no you got it all mixed up the bride was in heaven so see he took us out of the way God takes us out of the way and there's no tribulation for us but the remnant has to go not her not the pattern the remnant was there the persecution the Roman Empire like they said the other day don't worry about don't worry about communism and all the mother is except Romanism Catholicism will consolidate it though you're not there power together with the great church and they're doing it now you see them getting closer and closer and closer and closer alright let's read number five now we find out in this sixth seal now being open it was for a three-fold purpose now here was the purposes the first thing was that the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification we went through that amen they're better out with that the foolish virgin has to go through the tribulation for a purging or a purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in Revelation 7 between 6 and 7 chapter that she had been purged and she had been given her robes all right now she's not the bride but it's the church the pure people that that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way that they were blinded by these false prophets we see that happening now and they didn't get their get a chance and yet they're really since they're in heart because remember God knows your heart it's like I said about 144,000 it's not gonna be just 144,000 of anybody they just taking choose no it's gonna be the ones that God knows their heart all right yet their sincere heart and God knows their heart and here they're purged during this time so that's the first purging of the of the food's version another purging is what Israel has got to be gathered together that's the second fold God purges Israel in the Tribulation Period out of the millions that are getting there or will gather there there'll be a select 144,000 and they will be purged don't remember they got a dial they'll be persecuted they're going to be persecuted by their own people now there is a whole earth to be purged this is number three there will be such a thing that the moon stars that all nature will be purged you see what it is the earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the millennium because remember there were millennium was coming and see everything's got this fields gotta be purged during the sixth seal because remember even your denominational teaching they teach that the Bible says having an earth will pass away so we're just always go to heavens wherever kind of place that is and the Earth's can be destroyed listen to them but they're reading the Bible but thank God it took a prophet to just go right back into dictionary heaven and earth will pass away and pass away he's got that big a you know what ever ever ever ever word and it means just to be changed so heaven and earth will be changed Earth's not gonna be your earth snuggle be destroyed see that's when they go back to the old the old and most people in the message that this body can't be redeemed so God's just gonna get rid of it and bring us a new one up that's really too easy there wouldn't be any persecution in that there wouldn't be any purging in that no God's gonna take that filthy thing you've been walking in all your life and he's gonna change it just like his body was changed when he walked on the earth it wasn't filthy but yet it was in sin in sin in the world of sin Jesus's body wasn't sinful right but still he had to eat he had to do all the things that were human being he had thoughts comes remember his body was made eternal that's where you get your inheritance of an eternal body it's because Jesus's body had to be made eternal remember the ridge of the quote brother Ram said the inheritance he inherited he inherited when he walked out of that tomb he inherited eternal life in his body same way with me and you when we take a body change you will inherit eternal life in your body it's already been done the firstfruits is already up so now the field can do just like the first fruit that's what that first fruit was remember the first fruit was as you went looked at the in the field and the one that was the month that matured first had his head stuck up a little bit higher maybe the apples were bigger or what more you want to say the priest would go out and what he would do he would cut that out bring it back and wave it over the field not just that this is the only thing it's an example that the rest of the field is going to come to maturity and they're going to harvest it just like they did that wave when Christ was on Calvary he was the priest he was the first fruit he was the first one up out of the ground that took a glorified body I don't care what anybody else says he's the only one that's reach to immortality the Bible says and immortality means you were once immortal and now you're immortal there's only one person done that you say what about inna I'm not worried about that Jesus is one I'm worried about if he can do it I can do it because he said he was gonna do it through me and you so this being the change seal let's look at this just for a minute I wrote these notes and then we'll get back to her to our quotes if this is the steel that changes everything remember the flood changed the world 4000 years ago didn't destroy it but what happened as soon as Noah come out of the ark started standing again right so I just started to cycle all over again Jesus come on earth he came through it wound that nothing never happened like that before never know a man know never know a man that's that before well when he stepped on the world into the world look what happened there was a change that begun he said I am the way the truth and the life I'm the door come by me I'm the one I'm the one not me but Christ to say he kept trying to tell him who he was I'm the light of the world I've come to give this place a change but what did they do in that Joseph boy don't even make benches and baseball bats and some kind of carpenter what is he he's but it hit me works with his old daddy's daddy's old you know they you see what I mean because it was it was common to them like a lot of people's gonna say he's coming to us well how in the world can you don't worry about how in the world can you your change is gonna come from right here inside so Jesus changed the world total disruption of nature because nature says every seed has to bring forth of its kind and it takes a male and a female see where I'm going with this take some male and a female Christ comes and it doesn't take a male and a female like we say male and female that changed the world saying that you can be born the right way not to mom and daddy but that you can be born again and you can come the same way he came so he changed the world on the day of Pentecost Wow that came from having the sound of a rushing it wasn't just a ain't the way God broke into this dimension I believe it world that whole building now you know if it don't matter if they could hear it outside they knew what was going on inside it changed the world because now there was a hundred and twenty people that were born in sin that were born by momma and daddy we're now standing in an upper room shouting and praising God and starting a new world order we always talk about all over the world they got this new bush he's got this new world know that that Pentecost started a new world order all it didn't change the world back up and it didn't just do away with the devil but it started a process there was a nature change a hundred and twenty natures were killed and the nature of God was put in that it never happened never happened didn't happen Jesus was he wasn't born like they were this is people that were born from sex of mom and dad either wrong or you know you won't something not the right way it was the right way to come that way now but it wasn't guards provided first way it was supposed to be spoken word so that's exactly what happened on the day of Pentecost they came with them from rushing mighty wind and God birthed 120 children into the body of Christ never touched them with male instrumentality understand what I'm saying he touched him with the Word of God and that started a new world order that started what 2,000 years of a difference 2,000 years of a church of church ages of seven church ages it brought you and I to a place because that had to change the world so that the son of man listen to what I'm saying so the son of man could come back in the end time ain't not just changed the soul but change your body had to happen that way and there's a new world order that begun when the Prophet came on the scene and it thundered and the thunder was not that William Branham was God he was the Prophet but he said I'm bringing Christ to you and Christ will change your body a new world order forget about that world out there it's alright and then there's two hundred thousand thousand demons they reside pretty close to me I don't know about you but they're put there to change you because you're not gonna change yourself everybody do this they're not you're not going to change by yourself that's why God has a provided way to do this he gave us the total he gave us the whole prescription and then he released two hundred thousand thousand demons on Israel to drive them back to the homeland now he took them same two hundred thousand thousand demons and he put him on the bride he let him go on us to do what brother Brown said drive us back to the word our homeland will see my homeland is not just the Word of God my homeland is that the Word of God is going to change this thing right here because that's what the word said it would do we which are alive and remain to the coming of Lord shall not prevent those which are asleep where we shall all be changed but you change started today God killed that old nature he started a new world order because I'm gonna tell you something if will realize that we'll realize that we're way further than we think we are when we notice that that new world order listen did it not change your world when you got born again please people good grief you go like I said before Louise don't mind me you go to me in him the same way I didn't have a problem going to the beer store grab into Miller Lite Bud Light and putting it on the on my cart I had no reservation why because my old nature was taking over right my old nature was prevalent it was right there and it didn't bother me one bit to roll up there you know put it in take my good hard-earned cash out and and pay for that thing you know cuz I'd going home and I really didn't ever do that Jim can tell you I never did stuff she's going what do you do why I mean I did a lot of other things you didn't in the same way there was no reservation why because that old nature just continued it just kept pushing you but now with a new nature it changed my whole world I don't have the things in my house I used to have do you and you know whatever list it wherever you want to list it I don't have them girlie magazines I don't have to this I don't have that you point every you got on there you make a list why cuz I had a nature change it disrupted in my world thank God only God can change your nature to the right way that's why if we can save our kids we would but you can't because the one nature can't change another nature God's got to change your nature so those 200,000 out thousand demons were released on us to drive us to our homeland and my homeland like I said it's not just I'm not satisfied listen the words been here forever and ever and is forever gonna be here but there's never been a group of people take a body change this not died first a group I said if you want to waste everybody's going what about Enoch can I be blunt I don't care cuz I can't explain it if brother Brennan would have explained it if the Bible would have explained it no Enoch took the translation so Enoch is somewhere else but he's not bride I'm worried about bride whatever changed his nature or whatever that's fine with me that has nothing to do with us it's an example sure but don't try to figure it out you know what brother Brad never really answered it he said I don't know you know why because it didn't matter you and I are going to be the only people ever Adam to be born by momma and daddy raised up by the devil that Dad will be pour out of your house God walked in your house and now he's gonna walk in this that's never happened before even with Jesus cuz he was not born of sex you and I this is the nastiest of nasty this is nasty but God's gonna take out of that nasty same way with this world look at this world man look at all the things that could you imagine we look at things and we look at things on the surface but can you imagine all you think well the earthquake is going to be bad in California but I read them an article somebody wrote about what if that happened in California what would happen afterwards you talk about you know 30 million people dying instantly because they're drowned no that ain't gonna there's gonna be another 20 million I think or 10 or 20 million people that's gonna die of horrible diseases because all your gaps lines are gonna break all your sewer lines are gonna break there's gonna be no water you understand so the peripheral is what's gonna kill more than than that but see that nasty I don't that's nasty but that's what I was I was that nasty but God took me out of it God reached down and plucked me out of this world oh yeah we live in this world but God plucked me out of this world he plucked you out of this world give me my hand clapping pray thank God and now listen nature now will literally explode when our body changes literally this earth cannot handle God walking Oh two feet in a bribe that was so nasty Satan hates that worse than anything for this whole world it's gonna explode because of you cause God exploded this world first hey man so persecution that's okay I may not like it when he comes but bring it on because the products always come better under persecution let's reach second Timothy 3 verse 10 but thou has fully known my doctrine manner of life this is Paul purpose faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions what about a man that walks up and preaches to a group of people four or five times and they hate him so much they put him on the spot and they beat him 39 stripes save one because they say 48 lashes is want to kill you he carried those with him and he continued to preach he didn't just says Jeannie he didn't say I think I'm gonna get to get me a ticket and go to another for oh no he stayed right there why he had a purpose persecution affliction which came upon me unto me at Antioch at Iconium at Lystra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution Matthew 13 verse 20 but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word now remember this is the story parable or the seed and watch what happens if you're not rooted and grounded but he that received the seed in the stormy places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth how many times have you done that brother Dale has always told us you know you you see people come in this that you know right on the front row and they're all you can't contain them and six months later they're gone I always think of this scripture right here with joy they heard it but he that received the seed and cuz it was seed they received a message it just didn't go deep enough because watch in dystonia places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy and other words brought brought it on heaped it on with joy received it yet hath he not root in himself but he endure it for awhile for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word not because somebody don't like what you drive or don't like what you eat it's the word because of the word by and by he is offended in other words they leave Wow Deuteronomy 431 says when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days now this is this is God talking to Israel but he also jumped up he said even in the latter days if thou turn to the Lord thy God he shall be Oh beating into his voice but the Lord God God is a merciful God he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of thy father's which he sware unto them he's not gonna forget Israel I told you he's not how can God told us that how can a woman that's had a baby forget the baby so how can I forget Israel God said he's not gonna forget it as I'm sure he's gonna let him go through some persecution because of what they did he's going to let us go through persecution for the things we do but he will not forsake you or destroy you Matthew 24 verse 22 for then shall be Great Tribulation such as we're not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor even shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not I preached on this a long time ago cuz that's what God's that what that's what the devil's gonna do he's gonna say hey I can do this I can do the signs and wonders right follow me no you know why he you know why you won't get caught up in that cuz Christ is in you and once you realize he's in you all that other goes away but if you don't realize he's in you you will get caught up with that don't don't think maybe I won't know brother branham said he said mark of the beast or the mark of God one of the two there's not an in-between if you're not born again you will take the mark of the beast that's why the foolish virgin has to go through persecution because they accept that what's that excuse me except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh stay but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened thank God then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not for their share arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders hmm and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect brother Brent said but the Elector wherefore if they shall say unto you behold his in the desert go not forth why do I not why do I need to go in the desert he's right here oh he's out there at that other place no he's right here if you know he's right here then you ain't got to go to that other place amen behold he's in the desert go not for behold he's in the secret chamber believe it not for his the Lightning coming out of the east and shinin even unto the West so shall all show the Sun coming of the Son of Man be coz what you look up in the air and you go well where'd that come from you don't know where that lightning came from it could have come across this away and went that wind banged off of this and down here and over here and over this way the same way with the Son of Man but you and I don't know cuz you and I will be that I have no problem knowing where the son of man is he's the word made flesh in you that's enough for me I ain't gotta go find him nowhere else for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagle's be gathered together amen so where the carcass is where the word is there will the eagle's be gathered together so don't worry about anything little bride God's gonna take care of it all number six and I'm sorry really to have held you like this or mine but to just get a tape of this now the Lord willing this is what I'm speaking out of Phoenix Sunday afternoon then Monday I'm going a little short meat and so forth purposed in my heart this year for a little willing I'd cut and tore from side to side he has problems too and we all know that's the identification we know what the third pull is now this is Shalom 1964 and what's what he said everybody's want to know what the third pull is we know what the third pull is we know what it is is he opening the word it's not a great day Saturday she opening a word here's what he just said is he opening the word why and I think now this is your prophet saying this not me now you got you'll have the tape so everybody listening to tape they'll hear this and I think that it'll just lay dormant for a little while what the third Pole until the great hour of persecution comes on that's when it be it'll speak it'll be manifested just like the five straight signs without failure perfectly that's what you promised it it's laying dormant now that's what he just said read it again and I think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great hour of persecution comes on we have not had that great hour persecution yet but when we do what happened under the third pole of his ministry there were things spoken into existence there was a nature of two boys changed a man there was a nature boys changed under that third poll a man stood and changed nature on the mountain big storm coming in feats of snuff feet of snow coming in all these different things speaks it away that's an interruption of nature yeah hey man then you got squirrels that come from nowhere and there were the squirrels he's saying it's laying dormant you know why cuz it wasn't for them it's for you and me it's for me and you that third Pole ministry is not for brother branham it was for me and you he used it showed us it could be done but I'm reading read that one more time I think it'll just lay dormant for a little while until the great our persecution comes on now has the great our persecution come no why do you need to speak your cabinet full of food when Boyd needs to probably take a lot of his out no no not sit there and eat it all give it away but not really listen to be silly go open your cabinet you don't need it you don't need food like Rodell always said why wouldn't pray for rain and we've got ten inches of rain and we've got Friday and Saturday is fixing the sprain again why don't we pray for right we don't need to pray for rain we don't need to pray for food we need we need to pray to God to get us in position get us in position that when that hour does come that we can speed not call brother down say brother now I need some pork chops he know he may not know you need a pork job but God knows you need a pork chop so there they come there's whatever you need now it's not going to be a hole he's not gonna fill your freezer he's gonna he's gonna give you what you need not your wants he's gonna give you your needs but I believe we're coming to that our that's what we're I'm looking forward to I'm looking to that place to where that God can speak through you and things will happen we've all seen parts of that we've already seen things materialized because of of the speech of the word man let's go to number seven real quick the ninety ones at the end time noticed the very day when this messenger now look not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message now once brother I'm talking about yeah I have many many clothes that brother Brown says not in the years of preparation not in the healing campaigns in other words not from the 47 to 63 was building up we don't listen what you know as well as I do in this church there's a lot of people that say well brother man was wrong so we don't listen for 63 if you don't you won't have a clue what he's saying unless you read 47 to 63 you you're lost if you think that you know why you've lost the word he preached the word from 47 till the day passed he preached the Word of God I depend on that but not when he starts on but when he begins to declare remember his message the declaration of his message was in these seals that's what he was commissioned to bring was the opening of the seals see first pull healing second pull prophesy he didn't just take him by the hand any more he told him the secrets in their heart he didn't tell him God told him but he yielded itself so much to God that it that the gift worked the way it was supposed to all right but now third Pole the opening of the word the mysteries revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the Prophet can be vindicated is by the word and remember the third pole was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the world in the word do you see it the congregation says they're men I'm reading what he said the third pool is the opening of the seals yeah so are the seals open seals were open and they may not be to you and you can sit there ignorantly and say that they're not open but they're not open to you because they're open to me this is an open we preach out of an open book amen so the third pole is skin' in that opening of the seven seals the voice of God the Thunder the opening of the word has never been seen before when brother Brown whipped that when he whipped that top off of that pyramid he said light had never it wasn't that the word wasn't there the words always been in the Bible but nobody had looked there was not light had shone on that what was in that pyramid but when he whipped that top off I believe that's when the seals were open because there was a lid on it and he popped that lid off and he told us what God had said in the love letter that God had already wrote it's already been there it was just a love letter there between the lines that me and you guys amen so there it is the third pole was the opening of those seven seals so what's gonna take what's gonna change our body the third pole the opening of the seal that's what's gonna change our body if not then there's brother Dale's always said and I agree 100% then there's somewhere that somebody you're gonna have to die cuz you can't take all the word sorry or either that or god forbid you're not born again but one of the two you're not gonna take a body change and be a baby standing on earth now you may have to die the death and go by the grave and you may have to come up so what let's go back to that point I ain't got to worry about taxes anger worry about phone bill car payment well I'll have a car payment anyway house payment all the other stuff but the third pole was the opening of the seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word that's pretty plain so now let's read this real quick I want to read a few of these and we'll be done number one that's in the back of you it's one of these that brother Joe so graciously all these together and these are just four of them he gave me a whole bunch but I just picked out these now look notice from the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the habitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication her wine is what she was giving out her stimulation we are the church we're the one that's got it see now just draw that in your mind now alright see carried like the angel told John I'll show you this judgment that's coming to this great church now watch so he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet colored colored beast scarlet in the Bible represents royal the color scarlet means red the Beast represents power did you notice the beasts come up out of the sea that was in Revelations 13 now that goes back to United States right revelations 13 is America because with 13 stripes 13 colonies and when you see the beasts come up out at sea it meant that this power was raising up among the people but in Revelations 13 when this lamb come up he come up out of the earth no people United States but then after he had two little horns silver civil and ecclesiastical power and then he received power and spoke like the dragon did before him so you just got to mark it down we are coming into a religious now listen folks we ain't gotta wait the religious persecution is happening right now right now is a religious persecution that's where our persecution comes from the drunk doesn't care how much words you know he might need to hear about Jesus Christ but he don't care about the words you know I read you one in just a minute I hope I still got it I it's back there in the background I've got it on here one where brother Branham says in other words basically he's saying they'll get mad at you cuz you got it and they don't I mean you come to my house I'm just saying this for an example oh wait a minute good go to sister Hannah's house she's sitting there eating I don't want pork chops Jude we have pork chops in a long time we need pork chops pork chop she's sitting there eating pork chops and I ain't got enough strength to get up the steps and I think crying out to God or whoever to bring me food and I got no food but she's sitting there going man this pork chop just fell right out of the ceiling God was so good he just materialized and I'm sitting here eating now in my humanity if I'm born again I'll get mad I'm going after that pork chop Louise we going out to that pork chop we're gonna get the board job but that's religious persecution and it's happened in now because look at them they cut you off because of the things you preach are the things you don't preach there's always religion being religious persecution with the same thing we are coming into a religious persecution with the same thing that they did in pagan Rome many years ago for it's dusts at the Lord now what is it sitting upon a beast a power number two spoken words original seed now what they're trying to do they're trying to manufacture a ladder rain nonsense why the latter rain will sweep the world brother been a former rain sowing words brother branham sowed the former rain now we'll see that the latter what the latter rain produces I'm looking at it I'm looking at that being made real right now that's right now you'll see what the latter rain produces you'll find out there'll be an affliction the Pentecostals and all the groups will come together and they'll shut the doors on them guys that won't listen to it they won't even be allowed to open your mouth you won't even be allowed only mother right that's when he'll come who he Christ that's when he cries that's when that third Pole you see that third Pole lays dormant but now it's coming into being that's how he'll show that's when you'll see a rain oh my lay still be quiet uh-huh let it go just become as you can be because you can't manufactory number three spoken words regional city paragraph four forty three remember there'll be such a denominational gathering pretty soon it'll be terrific and they will bring themselves together into this Federation of churches and when this kind of church will be then this kind of church will be put out of operation as far as they know Thank You brother branham I appreciate you putting that in there as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus will appear and he will show which his bride this is it right here and he will show which his bride and which is not remember brother Brown said there was all kind of showdowns but there's one coming here a Mount Transfiguration showdown because you're gonna come to that Mount Transfiguration and you're either going to be transfigured or you're lost all right and he will show which is bright and which is not and remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake all the words has been written must be fulfilled jesus said so so we got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that's one of these things this boycott to come but before this boycott can come of the marking of the beast there has to be a seed sowed that's right now packing it in sowing the seed for God to take a church out of it you understand now congregation says amen a seed has to be sowed a denominational seed and they're to make a form or an image to the beast of Church of Rome there has to be a true bride and we understand that the so-called bride is rejected everybody all right with that say Amen all right now number four last thing started easing church age musicians you can get ready to come home you know we're living in the end time it's in this age that the churches are going to come together and as there are even now controlling world politics they will soon control the finances of the world we see that happening now all right and then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy ourselves you will lose all these who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church orders will be physically bereft now that word breath means is you're gonna do without something that you previously had all right there will be presented to them a great temptation to give in preachers will give in it's got to be false it's got to be the fault Shepard just got true bride can't do that preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist system please they will give in to the flatteries and blandishments of the hierarchy and the people will follow these false shepherds right into the slaughter but in the judgment they will all be found naked they will not be given those white robes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in the spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God it's time to wake up spoke a word church and hear the voice of God crying come out of her my people that she be not partakers of her sins that you received in her plagues amen God is speaking shun the religions of the world like you shun the plague leave off walking with the world and make your garments white by repentance than the blood of the Lamb but do it now for tomorrow may be too late let's stand to our feet all that live godly in christ shall suffer persecution and don't get me wrong we all enjoy the air-conditioning and the heating in the plumbing and and getting in there you know what I would not want to take I would not want to take one of them little catamaran boats from here to the Philippines I'll be glad when I get on that bird tomorrow and they fly me to Seattle for five hours and then they fly me about 14 hours to Seoul South Korea and in about three hours to the Manila and I'll be standing in the Philippines hopefully be rested a little bit but but you understand what I'm saying so a lot of people take it to one extreme like these Preppers and all and you know some people are trying their best to not have this and not have that there's a balance there's always a balance there's a balance to the Word of God you know you can you can do that if you want to do what your electricity I'm sure they'll cut it off for you you want to do without your gas don't go to Walmart either cuz that's the Antichrist know live you'll out the best you can let God lead you and guide you what to do if you feel a tug to not go that way don't go that way do you feel a tug to go that way go that way amen you love the Lord God
