========================================

good hey you bought one made it already that's alright [Music] run run the camera yeah well that's the first time I'm doing this on this side of the room because the last time I've done Sunday school down here it was over there [Music] go to pray from this morning Oh Cigna Corinthians chapter 10 chapter 10 appreciate brother the weeks filling in for my last Sunday I didn't realize I was gonna do a whole month I just he asked me brother way to ask me if I want to do Sunday school and I thought I thought he meant like one time I don't realize it for the whole month do one thing well I think that voice told me yeah wisely maybe twice and maybe can do next Sunday too no there's just about one time and we're gonna have our Christmas from thing next time you don't give anything you say second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 1 says now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward to you but I beseech you that I may be that I may know may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which some of us some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled so bless your name yeah so it's not prepared this morning so but haven't have been looking at something look last the last few weeks and won't start up a little a little different this morning and so they don't have a whole lot of time so so a couple little stories don't tell you and need low class participation this morning so if you've heard these stories before please don't answer when we live into somebody that's not heard the stories and let them answer okay this gentleman goes jogging from home he jogs a piece and then he makes a left and he goes so forward he makes another left and he keeps going he makes another turn and as he's approached at home he sees two masked men waiting for tea so from from my little story well sir I told you got two questions for you number one who were the two masked men and number one why did he go jogging from home go jogging from home anybody have any ideas I don't well they don't have the picture so you're you're lacking on that the two the two masked men want to tell you who they are y'all understand the two masked man is the catcher and the umpire so why did he go jogging from home obviously he hit a home run and won and so my story illustrates our thinking right the others the other love story is I had a psychology teacher asked us one time said if you think somebody comes staggering in the room drooling and babbling incoherently and grinning walks up taken that's the week's on the leg and just drilling and babbling incoherently and then crawls under the table legs in the floor what would y'all do I tell him I'm already married say everybody everybody would be saying they'd be saying espera laid and Rabab from because they're Canadians we're leaving and go had to listen yeah I say everybody's got a lot everybody's got a thought in their month well what if I told you if it was a talking say automatically your mind puts us in a place that we're thinking it away and Paul says here that we're supposed to cast down imaginations and bring into our thoughts into captivity under the Word of God right because see are when we don't see things clearly as Paul said you know what we see we only see parked if we don't see things clearly then are we our imagination automatically goes to work sure and if tries to fill in the gaps the problem is is that puts this contrary to the world sometimes and the other thing you know brother branham said that the right mental attitude towards a baby promise of God will bring it to pass do you know what the word attitude means attitude the definition of attitude is a pattern of thinking is a pattern of our feelings the way we think you know that's you know I always talk about kids they say you know kids don't learn to be to be hate you know to hate or to be mean that's something that's learned right and you know there's a lot of kids in this world you know they don't know the difference in people you know they just look because you know that's just like you meet kids and see kids in the store don't know him from anybody but you know they just get together and they have a good time and they you know they just fellowship a half and but you know a lot of people's like well you know this person you know they're black or this person is from another country or they have a different religion for they you know whatever it is that they draw their lines through and you know then they they learn that and they're conditioned that way and so it's always well I have you know we don't fellowship with these people it's all that's a condition is something that's learned yeah and you know many times we we see you know that's as brother branham said he was told by two people drawing outside their circles and he said well I saw Ronnie said I'll draw you back in they said I'm just drawing my circle speaker you know because you know if that was a story that brother Perry Greene always told about brother Branham and when he was in really great had the church in Beaumont Texas was pastoring the church down there brother great brother branham never would go by the greens church and preach but he'd always go to another brothers church and preach there and brother green asks brother brown one day he said brother brown a piece and wanted to you always when you come to you never come to my church he said you'll go to this other brothers Church he said it's very simple brother Perry he said I know if I go to your church that church over there and that brother won't come to your church but he said I know if I go to his church y'all will come and so you know it's just you know it's them drawing the circle beard because that's the way that brother Brandon was able to spread the message you know because he and it takes wisdom sometimes because our thoughts and our our feelings our attitude we don't want to do certain things we don't want to go certain places we don't we don't want to be around certain people and that's the nets are because that's our absolute that's our thoughts that's our feelings and you know some thousand yes none there's not the way that God wants us to be what God wants us to do because you know we are to be the God representative to the world and many times you know God wants us to be a shining light to everybody and sometimes sometimes the people God wants us to talk to his people we don't talk to it yeah you know it's it's though you know it's the people that you know I have an aunt and she's no long to glory my mom's old his sister and you know I remember as a kid you know she didn't have anything to do with this message my grandmother used tried to talk to her about it and you know that was the last thing in the world she wanted to hear about was this message and you know she's like mom don't talk to me about it though and you don't have this thought in my mind I thought Lord if you save her you save me anybody you know I just had this thought you know and I thought man you and you know somebody because I'm sure we all over for me or somebody in our life that you try to share the gospel with and they are the ones that are most adamant most against it they're the ones that push against it brilliance at the most but you know they come and my aunt sloth and her daughters were going to a denominational Church and you know she was praying one day and she said you know what is right God can you show me what's right she said because is it is that what these people say is is the truth or is it what my mom's been telling me all these years to be true and when she sat down and wanted God to show her what that what the truth of the Bible was what the truth of the word was then God began to show her and she accepted the message and become a believer but you know she had to come to a place after all because she had it in her mind you know how things were going to be but we do have to come to a place and put all that aside and you know I told her before she passed one time and I told her yeah I said you know I said I've told many people I said that if God could say you'd say anybody thanks a lot but you know we get that in our mind and we think it's impossible yeah but you know thing is is it's not impossible with God you know sometimes we we look at situations and we wonder why things are the way they are and makes them the situations are are really bad and then continue to get worse but you know Walker maybe sometimes that's what God's won't listen you realize that you know these situations are getting to the place where they need to be yeah you know sometimes we complain about things that the way things happen and why they happen the way they do but you know the the promise in the scripture to me is Romans 8 he said full we know that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord who are the called according to his purpose how no matter what situation looks like some that's what I look back to because it always works out it doesn't matter how bad how good work it all works out you know you know I've taken many Falls in my life and doesn't love a lot of things that went too smart but you know July the 29th of this year doing something I've done thousands of times stepping off of Leo and falling two feet and brink available I never expected that to happen not in a million years I fall them further than that yet the ground I never got hurt and you know you get you know you changes your whole life everything that you do and you know why why am i what you know crippled one arm did but you know one thing it teaches you it teaches you patience and you know it's a trial of your faith and you know what I've seen God work yes because you know they they told me I'd be a lot you know I'd have a lot more therapy and a lot more problems and you know it's bad when you go in you know like I've said many times when you go in and you see the surgeon and he looks at your CT scan the first thing he does is go look what does that mean he said oh it's bad he's an eight to his bed when you come out of surgery and he tells you that it was actually worse when he got in there than he what he felt but you know I've got my physical therapist told me that you know she's got a patient that broke her elbow and she's been at it longer and she doesn't have as much flexibility than I do and you know thank the Lord I'm up to 15 pounds now actually um I actually have more than that but that's what the doctors got me lifting at work so I can actually 15 pounds so so I'm not moving up slightly but you don't it's you know sometimes I sit around and you know the devil will play in your my shirt and you you wonder it's like someone to your life has changed but you know what the promise of God is all things work together for me even one of the things I've been able to testify us because the doctor has been amazed at how well I've did and the physical therapist has been and I've been able to testify about that well because God is good and he's a healer but you know what he'd never prompt they never promised us that we would have problems and trials and heartaches but you know what he always told us that he'd make a way and we come through those and you know what we sometimes the devil to get in our mind and we let him get in our mind and feed us bunch of lives that are not true but you know if we actually believe what God says you know the Bible's already over before it ever been him there they actually they've actually want to believe that and you know there's there's some more things that I didn't I didn't bring them today but there's some neat little things that I'm willing to look at and maybe next Sunday we'll we'll get into some level but you know it's it's pretty amazing what God has given to us and just a little share a little thought we need before we get done and wait didn't think I could do it but you know it's not been that long and I think we get through so he had said much to this morning do you think I could make I could do it short I didn't give the world peace first which others uh there's a Pope brother Brent talks about you and you know he says that you know man was not not made to lie and that's the reason they use a lie detector they can say it because when you tell a lie though I actually changes your body it hasn't a negative effect in your body and that's what a lot of attacker picks up your heart breaks your breathing you changes you it affects you negatively and he said they took over took a ammeter of some sort and this lady was pregnant and when she was praying they hooked her up to this machine and brother Brent says I can't tell how many kilowatts it was or whatever but he said while she was training he said she hadn't she created enough energy enough power in her prayer while she was pregnant they said you could have sent a radio signal around the world 455 pounds he said that scientific and you know this will the reason I got on this suddenly what was going I was reading that do you know what hit me it was like wow that's amazing but you know the first thing comes in our mind well that was her and that's what struck me you know it's our thought is well that was her but you know what it likes if the power of God is if the life of God lives inside of it one person can do it if it's ever been done one time then anybody can do it it's it because he's not a respecter of persons and if we can see the power that it because you know we go back to the scripture and we look at all those all the things that that's taking place in the scripture you know if it's if our attitude is what controls this if our thinking is what controls this if it's been done once then it can be done again and at least it lays before us it's it's a horse yes and many times we think well that's for somebody you know sometimes God wants us realize that's us amen we're the ones that are quick to do that you know go back through the scripture and you know I think it was a no maybe y'all correct me wrong but thing was Elijah he outrun the chariots and you know some of the some of the amazing things have taken place in the scripture when we think wow you know but you know what if we ever had me Joshua token you'll call for the Sun to stand steel and all those different things and we think well that was for them but you know that we could do the same thing for the Browns from the storm out of existence they're saying open the of them hard so running yeah god bless you all this morning [Music]
