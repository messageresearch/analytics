chance to express themselves cuz I believe that experience would never leave them sometimes we think of the children as though they're not being just there with us but um you know the things you say to them the things you say about them and the liberty and latitude that you have given to them right will always be there with them amen so you know that's important uh you know Jesus it was that says you suffer the little children to come unto me amen and forbid them not for of such is a kingdom of God Amen and wh soever cannot accept accept the king kingdom of God as a little child amen cannot enter therein amen you know you said well but they're not Christians you know show me where their sins are yeah amen as brother bam said the children right will go to heaven amen amen right amen praise God so we're certainly glad for that and today back home is our young people service amen so amen I guess we're just doing the same this evening I'd like you to turn your Bibles to the book of Philippians chapter 2 and then we'll also read from Ephesians chapter 1 certainly thank God for the spirit pre of being here with you amen I think it's 4 years I've not traveled in August right and um you know being in school and so and so this time would have been my time of exams and so by God's grace four years and 6 months have passed amen amen praise God and um but yet I was there every year right I was here every year because you invited me I was here right amen so I start appreciate that amen praise God and um you know sometimes I come and see you all get a little younger oh brother weed riding you know riding on um I don't know if it's riding for Jesus or so but I think when you get older you know you put those things aside you want to be on steady ground so I think he's getting younger is that right amen amen praise God so we thank God then for that experience amen praise God so me just glad to be here and um you know we leave tomorrow morning at um 10 minutes to 6 is our flight out of Charlotte so after the service we go just remember us in your pray and um when I go back home you know I I don't know but might be we're going to be shutting down the Plant and so I've been there for it's going 24 years and um you know the economies get so bad that it's not profitable to operate it really and so you know just think of the over 600 people is going to be out of a job and you know of the uh four plants that's the third that would have been shut down and so you know just remember God always have a way yes sir amen amen yes sir God Be not Afraid God always have a way and so now we don't know how he's going to do it but one thing is certain he's always on time amen amen so let us just bow head approach him as we go to the word this evening our gracious God and our father Lord we want to thank you for this privilege you have given to us to be in your house Lord God oh you spoke to us earlier today oh God we we're here again for the dropping of your word cuz Lord God every time we come oh God and Avail ourselves before the fire lord it's not us oh God but Lord we speak things Lord God hard for even our understanding Lord God we speak the Eternal Word of God in a mystery yes Lord bless us God and bless your children and Lord God we pray that these words that we speak today will be a memorial in us because Lord God we believe that these are the same words that's going to change our bodies that we use oh God to call those that have gone before us to the Grave to come back to this great Mount Zion Rapture Showdown amen and so God for that we give you thanks just bless us now as we look to your word one more time in Jesus name we pray amen thank in Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 let this mind being you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal that's right with God amen amen but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man yes sir and being found found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and be obedient unto death even the death of the Cross am in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 we know that the scripture very well according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love right having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abound towards us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery the Bible says he has made it known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself may the Lord his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated you know we we we preach of uh adoption I I'd like to speak for a little bit this evening on agents by adoption amen it seems like the two words doesn't really go together but the Bible reflects in the New Testament and the words of Jesus and the the the portray of the Life of Christ it reflects the ministry of the Jewish son coming into adoption and adoption is the placing of the son right you know Jesus Transfiguration upon the mountain you know the Bible says that it was so important that God allowed Moses and Elijah to come and stand by him that's right and then the Earthly witness yep Peter James and John y you know standing there the Bible says they were taken up into the mountain apart and and there he was transfigured before them right and the words this is my son he he him Amen in other words that adoption brings the words of the son in direct line to the words of the father right exactly and that adoption did not stop there with Jesus but it was extended to you and I right so much so that you know brother Bri said in the M Spirit of Truth he's interested in you and he's interested in me he's interested to see his word made manifest and he's depending on us to do it for we are his agents am Hallelujah nothing in ourselves we are agents but it's nothing in ourselves hallelujah it's him yielding ourselves and walking with him amen an agent the we we say and in law an agent they said has certain Duty mhm and there's a covenant to an angel which he cannot break as long as he's an agent amen and in law we we say an agent has a fucy duty to his client right and an agent is a person that is authorized to carry on the affair of another listen what brother bam said in the Queen of Sheba he said but in every generation God has always had his agents it's got down to some time to merely one right right but God always have somebody in every generation that he could lay his finger on some people that he could put his finger on and says uh this is my people amen and they will do as I tell them to do right amen they act not on their own but they act on the behalf of the Messiah Amen brother bream in dealing with the placing of a son looking at uh Romans there he said he talk about the mystery of his will he said remember how he hands on that how many he was here this morning let us see and he said the mystery of his will now it is not just a little thing that it's a mystery God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for himself or herself Hallelujah God's mystery you've got to seek it out for yourself in other words you've got to become so concerned that I want to know the will of God for my life amen is that all right hallelujah amen and he talks about the life of Paul and Paul said you know when I when I receive it he said I confer not with flesh and blood right neither did I go to those that were Apostles before me but he went to Arabia Paul speaks you know of his own exploits to the word of God now Hallelujah he said God at the beginning predestinated us unto eternal life amen hallelujah amen those who he forn he called and those who we called he has already Justified and those who we Justified he has already glorify Hallelujah God since the beginning of the world predestinated us unto the adoption of sons amen God been predestinated you unto the new birth right no because he would have defeated his own purpose are you there with me amen he did not predestinated you as a bride right he would have defeated his purpose he never predestinated you unto the wife of God no sir but he predestinated you amen as an offspring of God are you there with Meen therefore you manifest the word of almighty God and coming into that adoption the words to Jesus is a the same word to you this is my son he he him Brethren I'm trying to say that the focus of Our Lives as believer is got to be the spoken word the bride's got to be the word made manifest hallelujah amen brother Bram said the word is in the bride as it was in Mary Hallelujah and all the the believer can make the word of God live in this day yes sir hallelujah amen praise God he said now God since the beginning of the world predestinated us to the adoption of sons now the so from the beginning he predestinated us to Sons he said but now the whole creation gr right and wait for the manifestation of these Sons amen that's right you are predestined to it right but now in the last days everything is groaning and travailing am me to see you the manifested word of God In Action again and he calls it the mystery of his will Hallelujah so he said this is the make known age he has made known unto us the mystery of his will therefore it's no more mystery Hallelujah to the world it's a mystery to you it's not a mystery right because God has made it known to you Hallelujah that you are Christ by the word of God Amen right hallelujah amen he said realize who attitude and who is God we are Sons and Daughters of God We Are The Offspring of God now then we are something like God was amen are you there with me amen Jesus said himself it is written you are God's Hallelujah written in your law right we become a part of God a Son of God by adoption through Jesus Christ amen hallelujah oh Jesus was glorified and in your adoption it is glorifying Christ in you the glorification is not in the 16 elements no this perish hallelujah amen to come it's got to change are you there but Christ in you is a hope of Glory can you take that amen oh Hallelujah then galatian 1 tells us that we were predestinated to the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ predestinated of God through many are called but few are chosen Hallelujah and Brethren we've got to seek God for ourselves because you got to be chosen and how do I know that I'm chosen because the word reveals it to me Hallelujah amen yes sir that's right many C you are chosen The Chosen was chose at the beginning amen now but we are predestinated to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ God chose you aren't you glad for that amen hallelujah sir amen identify Christ of all ages now it wouldn't be me if he did that because first it was God in the pillar of fire how many believe that God above us amen then God With Us in Christ now God in usall Hallelujah is condescending amen and if he condescend to me Hallelujah then I am ascending in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen that's right amen yes sir sons of God Amen in the adoption that Jesus comes to do to redeem God's attribute as he did at the beginning now if his word dwell in here and have told the truth and that it is and the word is in here in my heart then God will identify himself as that being the truth then what ought that to do to this congregation he said what it ought to do when you see the scripture right here before you and you know bre what it is is the very word of God stepping from the pages and living in a body amen hallelujah amen amen the Romans in Romans 8 even we ourselves grown so the whole creation grown grown for what they're waiting to see the manifestation of the sons of God what is the manifestation of the sons of God God manifested in flesh Hallelujah the word of God manifested in The Bride of Jesus Christ like we say this morning she become the final voice to the final age anything that's going to come out of that is going to come out of the Bride because God invested everything in the bride Hallelujah waiting for the adoption to know the Redemption of our bodies amen don't that make us all folks he said feel good yeah Hallelujah it ought to make us all feel good waiting for this hour right not that hour this hour amen but when this Revelation come to you it is this hour Amen in that day when he comes to you you shall know hallelujah amen amen right Glory because there has been New Life comes in here that speak a new world Amen how many love that yes amen hallelujah then if he's there if he's there then we represent him are you there with me Hallelujah now an agent speak not of himself that's right Hallelujah but yet he represent his CL mm are you with me yes and so when the agent comes along he's a bearer right but he's got Authority Hallelujah to carry off the Affairs now Paul in like manner of this he he speaks in Philippians to he said let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus amen oh being in the form of God he not robbery to be equal with God the focus of his conversation is not Jesus Christ the focus of his conversation is you Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah so he said you got to have the same mind that's right Hallelujah you know Brethren I find that many things that are there in the word of God the people becomes afraid even to say what is God's word because of what somebody's going to say y that's right you think of it between 1963 and 1965 the things that brother brandham said oh they said it took too much upon himself oh my because they weren't ready for that word in that day then I tell you what he there's God to be a word to wave the Bri to her position to let her realize this is your day this is your message this is your manifestation you've got to he on God in this day you've got to make the word of God live in your life you are living Epistles right off all men if another generation to come and read of the exploit of God it be your life on paper amen it be your words on paper amen amen hallelujah right that's what it is that's what I believe amen amen she's going to know who she is amen hallelujah and the end time sign seed and I believe that these latterday signs and things that happening everyone of them is speling together to show that Christ is ready to come for this bride amen it's God in the word made manifest in a man right a perfect man amen so it's God and his word coming again and making himself manifested in a bride where is he manifested in a bride not will do like Eve did no right will not do like Eve did I bre to something else but the unadulterated word of God will be born in that church and she'll stand like Jesus Christ did amen hello somebody can you take that and she will stand like Jesus Christ did with his Spirit anointing in his word amen hallelujah it's got to be the word amen amen amen and we talk about agents by adoption here he him amen his word is as good as mine brother Bren begin to say his name on the check is as good as mine are you there with me yes it it's not to say no I've accepted him now look at his exploit look at the works that he do no sir it is now his word whatever he say I say right hallelujah amen amen you know I've had some experience sometimes that you know in the church somebody would want a favor or something and and so they go to my wife and and they say it and and she didn't give them what she want so you know what they come to me yeah hello yeah and I had to get to a stage in the church where I said to them don't do it if she tells you one thing don't come to me because we to need to say the same thing amen hallelujah and so with the bride and Christ the two need to say the same word if she says contrary to his his word there's something wrong somewhere because it must be his spirit manifesting in her are you there with me so when she confirm the word he just perform it oh hallelujah amen so the Christ that we serve he said speak and I will perform it when you go representing me I'm with you right always Until the End of the Age Hallelujah and if you bind anything I will bind it and if you lose anything I will lose it you you see the agency amen hallelujah if you speak the word I'll perform it if you have fail to believe my words nothing will stand before you not even cancel Hallelujah that's the agent of God God knows what he's talking to and I tell you one thing his word cannot fail because he's God right Hallelujah so you carry a word Beyond yourself can I say it like that amen right Amen in other words you carry a divinely revealed word in other words can I say dainty Tabernacle behind skin am are you there with me I represent Heaven amen hallelujah and the authority of Heaven Hallelujah because I understand my position in the word of God that is why to the Jewish son sunship y was not just something he grow into no right sunship was something he was trained for because the father had to have confidence in the son right right and so the Bible said and and the that son though he is a he of all is under tutorship and government it differ nothing from a servant that's right until the tutors are true with the job and the father has called all the village together amen hello somebody in a grand celebration because the father is satisfied that now his reflection is in his son if you can see that in the natural think about it in the spiritual that the father is satisfied that his reflection is in his son and daughter are you there with me and he's calling all together and said have you considered oh hallelujah oh glory to God Amen de to Tabernacle amen amen right you know I was looking at the story of The Prodigal and you know Jesus tell the story he said and he gave him that portion of his living no by Jewish custom you wouldn't give a son who had not come to the position of adoption of the father what is due to him right right and so that son is not a bad son right right no that son had to be a good son and so he said father give me my portion because I've come to position and the father gave to him but I gave you a picture of you and that tonight right so the son that he take it to a far country and he's qued all of his living right and he feel himself oh but the servants I got a better position that I have Hallelujah I'm going to go back to my father and when I go I'm going to say father as so made me a servant but a son that has been conferred with adoption cannot be a servant amen yes sir Hallelujah that's right amen that's right because he's adopted not because he's born no sir but because he's adopted and it has been confirmed unto him amen as a son amen oh sunship is a place is a position and when this position was his it didn't matter if he will return the father would put a ring on his finger amen sh that his feet a robe upon Him royalties is amen amen because he was royalty before he left can I say to you amen so you are royalty amen amen roal blood run through your PR thank you Jesus Hallelujah and in that royalty brother B said in the message God's Gift always find their places he said then you identify yourself with the de is that right amen right because your adopted son right amen amen amen whatever you do you represent him deity is with you by giving all you are what you are to Dey himself now Christ in this day that we know living is still Dey right Hallelujah Dey among the people is still Dey because he is a word amen and when we see the word living itself then we know that man can't do that it's dity the word being made manifest by man Jesus said himself the son can do nothing in himself I can do nothing I'm a man Jesus said but my father that dwell in me he show me all things himself that himself doth amen there you are what is it de being identified in man now the same thing is today amen amen amen Lord right hello somebody amen that's right the same thing Y is today amen that deity the promised word for this day can identify itself in you cuz you're are royalty amen that's right amen amen the promised word it is promise for today amen and it's identifying itself in you yes sir oh glory amen hallelujah then can you hold to it show that you believe in it give it deity believe it service and be ready to die out to yourself and your own thoughts are you willing oh if you're going to get there you're going to die out to yourself you're going to die out to your own thoughts amen and let dity lives with within you you are agents right of Dey amen hallelujah the message perseverance he said he was crucified for us since died buried Rose the third day ascended into heaven and it's back here again in the name in the form of the Holy Spirit God dwelling one time God above us God God above us in Christ God With Us no God in us it's God working his way back into man to worship be worship true man God's agency God does nothing outside of a man being his agent his hel you've got a Duty right GL Hallelujah so Paul said If any man be in Christ is a new creature you can't be diry one day and a come the following day hello somebody the Bible says we are peculiar people said then then why don't we do like like they do no because you're peculiar people you're are royalty you can't do like they do we can't walk the Bible said walk not like other Gentiles walk hallelujah amen in the vanity of their minds no sir because we know who we are amen right oh Jesus but you know what the devil do to us this say like they did in the Old Testament he said let them work until the words mean nothing to amen you know let us be distracted let us do things that satisfy the flesh right right let us have a good time let us try to live out the American dream until the word of God means nothing it is just word spoken amen LIF up the word with the central theme of your life amen that's what the devil wants right hello that these words are spoken and you look to a day that is coming right you look at that which is past but what about now hello somebody that is why we're Weak and Powerless because we don't know who we are but Simon Peter said Master the victory that curse it's DED up he said I fa in God right right but you if you would say right Hallelujah because it's not just for me right God hallelujah sharing extending his strong Sharing his glory with you and I are you there with me oh he could have come down and do everything Hallelujah there is ordained for us in this day but God invested that in you and I Hallelujah it becomes our position in Christ am do you love him am hallelujah amen amen yes sir in said Mark 13:11 but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thoughts beforehand what you shall speak neither do you premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye right for it is not he that speak but the Holy Ghost what hour brother dick if what the scripture says pertains to this hour yeah hello y then the word has laid their dment for years righten on the page but in this day that word lives in a many body Hallelujah that's right and you've got more from God than you think you've got more Authority than you think but when you come crying Hall feel like you're powerless you need to turn around and tell the devil s you're a liar right amen you try to let us think that we are powerless you try to let us think we are po right you're try to let us think that we've got no power when God manifest and invested his word in US sir right right Hallelujah M amen amen because we are his agent we are the Agents of God by adoption amen we're wearing our children we grown up mature in the fith Hallelujah and because of that the angel of the Lord in 1951 and the only hands he has on Earth tonight is my hands and your hands do you believe that amen sir Hallelujah God would move this over here without you doing it and he wouldn't put it back without you doing it are you there with me he wouldn't lift this Bible off without you doing it you are the only answer he has he would heal the sick without you doing it are you there with me he would visit the fatherless unless you do it he would proclaim the accept of a year unless you do it in this name if you fail to do it then the sticks of the storm might rise up but they Ain rising up because I won't shut my mouths amen amen amen we say until the people believe amen amen the only mou that he has is your mouth and my mouth that's what he said yes he said that's why he said I will be with you even in you to the end of the world is that his word hallel see then it's him it is not you that speak he said but your heavenly father
