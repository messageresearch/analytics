[33:54] horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and
[33:58] upon his
[33:59] heads what upon his heads right the name
[34:03] of blasphemia yep and the Beast which I
[34:06] saw was like unto a leopard and his feet
[34:08] were as the feet of a bear and his mouth
[34:12] as the mouth of a lion and the dragon
[34:14] gave him his power and deceit and great
[34:17] Authority and I saw one of the heads as
[34:19] it were wounded under
[34:21] death and his deadly wound was healed
[34:24] and all the world wondered after the
[34:26] Beast
[34:27] they worshiped the dragon which gave
[34:29] power unto the Beast and they worshiped
[34:31] the Beast saying who is like unto the
[34:33] Beast who is able to make war with him
[34:37] there was given unto him a great a mouth
[34:39] speaking great things blasphemies power
[34:42] was given unto him to continue for in
[34:44] two months and he opened his mouth in
[34:47] blasphemy against God to blaspheme his
[34:50] name and his Tabernacle and them that
[34:52] dwell in heaven and it was given unto
[34:55] him to make war with the Saints and to
[34:57] overcome them and power was given un
[34:59] given him over all kindreds and tongues
[35:02] and Nations and all that dwell upon the
[35:04] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[35:06] not written in the book of the life of
[35:09] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[35:12] the world you may be seated the Lord
[35:14] that
[35:15] is blessing to the reading of the word I
[35:18] was start thinking and maybe some of you
[35:20] especially on the internet system
[35:23] wouldn't know what I'm going to say but
[35:28] the brother you heard saying just a
[35:31] moment
[35:33] ago back years ago he was fishing with
[35:36] his brother and he fell out of a
[35:39] boat and he don't know and they don't
[35:42] know how long he was
[35:45] underwater he said the last thing he
[35:47] remembered doing was just thinking cuz
[35:49] he had on boots and they just sucked up
[35:52] the water so he couldn't come back up
[35:54] and he just stuck the rod up and held
[35:59] it his brother had to get back to the
[36:02] boat get in the boat get back to where
[36:03] they
[36:04] were and he just reached down in the
[36:07] water with his hands and picked up and
[36:09] caught the end of the rod pulled him up
[36:12] out of it
[36:15] now I'll bet you that there's a lot of
[36:18] Rod and re Country Companies would love
[36:22] to put their name on that because how
[36:25] many that's right how many how many rods
[36:28] are they in the world that's right and
[36:31] this is not deep sea fishing no how many
[36:34] rods would pull up a little bit over 200
[36:39] lb and bring him up out of the water
[36:41] that's right amen you know there's
[36:44] miracles of god
[36:47] am
[36:53] we amen
[36:55] amen left and in a hurry getting down
[36:57] there cuz it was down in what was
[37:01] it way down the road there
[37:05] for gri gri going down that way and
[37:08] thinking Lord what in the world old
[37:11] see could no mad can survive under the
[37:13] water right he just ain't made that way
[37:17] no that's right but we got there and he
[37:19] just sitting under the bed Laing and
[37:21] talking just like nothing happen thank
[37:25] God Amen he's a miracle working amen all
[37:28] right now not just mention much about it
[37:31] but to back up a little bit and just say
[37:34] what we were talking about this morning
[37:37] that you know there's a compound
[37:40] meaning and even the prophet said a
[37:42] compound Revelation now not a
[37:44] different not a different Revelation and
[37:47] you say well that's the way I see it and
[37:49] that's the way you see it okay if if
[37:53] it's correct then all right but but it's
[37:56] not saying I see three gods in the Bible
[37:59] now what do you see well I see one God
[38:02] now see you're just arguing quotes right
[38:05] you know because you know the truth is
[38:08] the truth and a
[38:09] compound understanding like
[38:12] calling Jacob or Israel out of Egypt and
[38:16] calling Jesus out of Egypt right are
[38:19] like the things we covered about the
[38:21] remnant of the woman's seed which would
[38:24] be the 144,000 the remnant of Israel and
[38:28] then the the foolish virgins is the
[38:29] remnant of the Bride right all right and
[38:32] seeing those things and just looking at
[38:35] these scriptures as we go through to try
[38:38] to help and you could literally spend
[38:40] months on any of these uh scriptures but
[38:45] I'm just trying to just get a little
[38:47] idea as to we look at it and see what
[38:49] these things mean and their
[38:53] symbols all right and it took a prophet
[38:57] to come and give us the understanding of
[38:59] these symbols thank God for that we
[39:02] could have man's ideas and opinions and
[39:04] you can read them the commentaries and
[39:06] different things and one will say it's
[39:08] this and the other will say it's that
[39:10] and you know but thank God for the
[39:13] revealing of his word all right but not
[39:17] a different meaning
[39:19] now but even as to
[39:21] be the Israel of the old and the Jesus
[39:26] you know the brighter than you right
[39:28] that's compound
[39:30] meaning but it all ties together amen
[39:33] and it has in related connections it
[39:35] cannot be
[39:36] separated so thereby you can understand
[39:39] the Book of Revelations and see what
[39:41] I've said for 30 years or 40 nearly that
[39:45] the sealed is not to the bride no right
[39:48] they're to Israel amen the literal
[39:50] things but the Revelation is to the
[39:54] bride we don't have to go through the
[39:56] tri ration period to find out what's
[39:57] going to happen we just read the prophet
[40:00] and he tells us what these things are
[40:02] going to be well that's what I love to
[40:04] read is the scripture and that's why I
[40:05] said for many years see I I've studied
[40:08] and you anybody can see my Bible I just
[40:10] write right to the side of it there am
[40:12] what the prophet said this is right all
[40:15] right and that way then I I don't have
[40:17] to say well what's your input right
[40:21] that's really smart I'm just old country
[40:23] boy I never didn't know what input mean
[40:25] I'd have to go home look at do you know
[40:28] you say well it just means whatever you
[40:30] think well I didn't think we're supposed
[40:32] to think I thought we were supposed to
[40:35] believe the word all right but now
[40:39] listen looking at the
[40:42] symbols and seeing the symbols of the
[40:45] Bible and then it makes
[40:48] it
[40:50] simple and we're not looking for a King
[40:52] Kong Beast to run across not looking for
[40:55] a big leopard to be running or a line to
[40:57] be
[40:59] roaring and all
[41:02] right see looking at simple
[41:06] things well one of these days the Bible
[41:09] says the moon will turn to blood well it
[41:11] just well it's just going to turn the
[41:12] blood the prophet said I can show you
[41:14] where that's already
[41:15] happened I
[41:17] can't cuz I ain't never found where he
[41:19] told me to happened right but I believe
[41:22] what he said don't you
[41:24] right all right been looking for these
[41:27] great things to transpire we can be
[41:31] deceived that's right you know but if we
[41:35] are programmed by it to understand it's
[41:38] simple then amen it's not something that
[41:41] cannot be
[41:43] comprehended you could spend I said
[41:45] weeks and weeks going back to the Book
[41:46] of Daniel and just take this first verse
[41:49] that we read of the 13th or the first
[41:51] and the second and get a beast and a
[41:53] lion and a I mean a leopard and and feed
[41:56] of this and that and go back into the
[41:57] Book of Daniel go back there and read
[41:59] the book of Daniel y and you'll find
[42:02] some of those things where the mees of
[42:04] Persians and Roman governments as they
[42:06] were coming down in the stages as they
[42:08] were
[42:09] coming and yet we're looking for this to
[42:12] happen what it's already happened amen
[42:16] see but thank God for the truth amen
[42:19] right
[42:21] now we read here in Revelations 13 we be
[42:24] dealing with just a little bit probably
[42:26] verse one's about all we'll get because
[42:29] of what I want to say in a
[42:31] second but we see in Revelations
[42:36] 131 that it speaks now here's what I'm
[42:39] trying to say about the compound see
[42:41] watch it go back watch's this be one
[42:43] continual Vision as the Book of Daniel a
[42:47] dream or a vision whatever he have he'd
[42:49] have one and he have another one that
[42:51] next one just adds a little bit too and
[42:54] then the next one just adds a little bit
[42:55] too the next one just adds a little bit
[42:58] to and that's the way God does things
[43:01] amen you know to put it together to
[43:04] where that we can follow it the Book of
[43:07] Revelations to me see as I said we start
[43:10] Revelations uh
[43:12] 7 you're already picked up the
[43:14] tribulation period you're only dealing
[43:15] with a 3 and 1/2 year period but you got
[43:19] 7even 8 N9 10 11 12 13 they were already
[43:22] up and we're only dealing with 3 and 1/2
[43:24] years of time
[43:27] but yet these things that we're seeing
[43:28] are
[43:29] transpiring during that period of
[43:32] time so it's not looking for some kind
[43:35] of a great animal thing look at the
[43:38] symbols to see what it means right amen
[43:41] we were talking this morning there about
[43:43] the remnant and says it sent out the the
[43:46] floods well that looks like the whole
[43:48] world is going to be flooded with water
[43:49] there this great floods of water no it
[43:53] Waters is multitudes and people right
[43:56] amen right amen and you can see that
[43:59] your next door
[44:04] neighbor
[44:07] right is the one you're talking about
[44:10] right right right we're still protected
[44:15] by our government and thank God for that
[44:18] you we were trying to cover there a
[44:19] little bit about it this morning about
[44:21] the Jews coming to this country see the
[44:23] Bible says they come over the wall they
[44:25] come to Propet said they come to America
[44:27] why because that was the The Haven of
[44:29] Rest right because even the rest of the
[44:31] world was killing them and all of the
[44:34] different things but then we wound up
[44:36] talking about right at the end about how
[44:39] that you
[44:40] know they were
[44:43] were protecting of them in America
[44:47] Sister Barbara was bringing it to my
[44:48] attention she didn't explain it a whole
[44:50] lot better than I can that you know that
[44:53] the first person that stepped their foot
[44:55] off of Columbus his
[44:57] boat into American soil was a
[45:02] Jew and she says
[45:04] that's let her give you the page number
[45:06] the paragraph all right
[45:10] see is it something that they were sent
[45:12] here for protection right to take care
[45:16] of them all of those Millions being
[45:19] killed but you know what the shame of
[45:21] America is that they're allowed Millions
[45:23] to be killed right and remember
[45:27] remember that there was a rabbi went
[45:30] to one of our
[45:33] ambassadors and begged him to help them
[45:36] during this problem and he laughed and
[45:39] made fun of him and turned away and that
[45:41] Rabbi cursed that
[45:43] Family Y and that family has had cursed
[45:47] on them ever since that's
[45:50] right well I couldn't have because he
[45:52] wouldn't have God yes he was of God
[45:59] see that's where we want to tie
[46:00] everything to our little thoughts and
[46:02] ideas but you see they came to America
[46:04] for freedom and we came here for
[46:07] Religious Freedom right and now we're
[46:09] voting away yep our
[46:13] freedom that's why I told you last time
[46:15] I voted years before I came into message
[46:17] in ' 66 heard about it I voted for John
[46:21] F
[46:22] Kennedy brother R said look said you
[46:24] come over here for religion just Freedom
[46:26] you know freedom from from religion and
[46:29] said you voted into the White House you
[46:31] know I haven't voted since then for
[46:33] President
[46:36] right cuz I just don't you vote that's
[46:39] they doing I just said that's me see
[46:41] because look what a goof up and he said
[46:43] then said watch till they wormed their
[46:44] way into the Senate and the house and
[46:46] the C I got it written somewhere in the
[46:48] front of my Bible and this was about
[46:50] 1967 68 that I had I ran up as much as I
[46:54] could find of how many many
[46:56] representatives how many these how many
[46:58] congress how much Senate was already
[47:00] Catholic yeah and it was a big major big
[47:05] not a majority but a great big amount of
[47:07] people were already in those
[47:10] offices right Church we're we're in the
[47:12] end time whether we want to believe it
[47:14] or not you know not to try to scare
[47:17] somebody I like what was said the other
[47:19] day somebody was talking about it where
[47:21] you know that
[47:23] said man said well brother brandom said
[47:25] you scare of them people talking about
[47:27] the coming of Jesus Christ yeah I like
[47:29] what brother R said he said yeah you
[47:31] don't want to see us coming yeah right
[47:34] you don't want to see us coming
[47:38] right don't worry about it you ain't
[47:39] going to scare nobody right amen we've
[47:42] done spooked too much but now
[47:45] listen Revelations 13:1 talks about this
[47:50] Beast that will rise up out of the
[47:53] sea having seven heads and and 10 horns
[47:57] and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon
[47:59] his head the name of blasphemy well we
[48:02] you know we covered that on verse one of
[48:06] chapter
[48:07] 12 because it's almost identical
[48:10] carrying a woman clothed in the Sun and
[48:12] under her feet upon her head a crown of
[48:15] 12 stars and she being with child and
[48:17] then it comes down to the verse three
[48:20] and it comes down to verse three and
[48:21] appeared another great Wonder in heaven
[48:24] and behold a great red dragon having
[48:26] seven horns and 10 seven heads and 10
[48:29] horns and seven crowns upon his head y
[48:32] whoever who this is in Chapter 13 with
[48:35] this Beast is the same being person
[48:39] whatever you call it as chapter 12
[48:44] covers of verse three right so we don't
[48:47] have to worry about who this
[48:51] is all right who is that great red
[48:54] dragon WR
[48:56] amen who is this Beast here Rome we
[49:01] don't have time to get to it I know but
[49:02] I've got the notes in here for it but
[49:04] what about the image to the Beast right
[49:08] we'll get back to that if we have time
[49:10] but we don't I'm sure we won't but just
[49:12] think about it we don't have to in other
[49:15] words he's telling you here just like I
[49:17] said about the Book of Daniel it shows
[49:19] you this and then it shows you the Roman
[49:21] government as it preceded from mea
[49:23] Persians to to this to Alexander to to
[49:26] coming
[49:28] down and see here we look in the 12th
[49:30] chapter and we find this
[49:33] dragon with seven heads and 10
[49:37] horns you know and seven heads up crowns
[49:40] up on his head now we see the Great
[49:43] Dragon now the next chapter we see it as
[49:46] a beast
[49:48] right so if we see this is Rome over
[49:51] here then why are we hunting the Beast
[49:54] over here
[49:56] you know what I'm
[49:57] saying it would be the same
[50:01] situation right coming down as to to
[50:04] give us understanding and that has
[50:06] always been Rome we covered our you know
[50:09] Wednesday night I guess it was paragraph
[50:11] 53 of the 10
[50:13] virgins this for one to where you can go
[50:15] with it that it would be
[50:18] Rome and then you
[50:20] remember natural
[50:23] Rome was the first to try to kill Jesus
[50:29] right Caesar or hared you know
[50:34] right yep gave a commandment for all the
[50:37] babies to be killed yep amen trying to
[50:41] destroy Jesus
[50:44] Christ see then that same thing the
[50:48] prophet said he said that me same comes
[50:51] over into
[50:53] the Rome
[50:56] that there stood the Jews you say Well
[50:58] they're over here and Rome they're over
[51:01] there but when those Jews said let his
[51:04] blood be on us crucify him we have only
[51:08] one
[51:10] God and his name is Caesar they had the
[51:13] same Roman spirit that was killing the
[51:17] babies am right in the
[51:19] natural you
[51:21] understand see it's very simple to look
[51:25] at it right and to see what it's
[51:28] doing and see that Rome then it comes on
[51:31] down we'll get back to these because we
[51:33] don't have time today but we'll get over
[51:36] to where that the the womb was healed
[51:38] and and the Beast was and come back one
[51:42] of his heads and things and to see those
[51:45] things and look at it as looking in our
[51:49] day amen that's
[51:51] it then an our day in our time MH
[51:55] because even though this would be the
[51:56] tribulation period that we'd be reading
[51:58] about but this dragon that we read about
[52:02] in chapter 12 it it's taken that 2,000
[52:06] years to come into being into the way
[52:08] that that Satan wants it to be and then
[52:11] when we get over here we find in chapter
[52:15] 12 as we covering this morning if you'll
[52:17] watch the way I try to lay things out
[52:20] after the bride is taken up after this
[52:23] 144,000 is called out mhm after he's
[52:26] loosed onto these you
[52:29] know see now he's the Beast right cuz he
[52:34] can't be the Beast until we get out of
[52:35] here that's
[52:38] right he is not the
[52:40] Beast until we leave right why because
[52:45] he can't be here at the same time we are
[52:48] right man and God God would not allow
[52:51] that to take
[52:53] place Satan doesn't know how to be the
[52:57] Beast until the bride becomes the
[53:01] fullness of the godhead bodily incarnate
[53:06] in a
[53:06] people prise God because what is the
[53:09] beast beast is Satan
[53:13] incarnate in a man that's right amen he
[53:16] can't be that until we get out of here
[53:18] you break scripture right so he's not
[53:21] the
[53:22] Beast he is now the incarn
[53:25] false prophet our Pope
[53:29] right he's not in the form of the Beast
[53:32] right he won't do that until he sits in
[53:34] the temple of God showing himself to be
[53:35] as God Amen and that's after the Rapture
[53:38] cuz he doesn't know how to do it we read
[53:39] it this morning where brother R said as
[53:42] we go up for seal he said he comes down
[53:45] becomes incarnate in the
[53:48] Beast after we're
[53:50] gone that the Beast can come into be so
[53:53] it's just showing you this and then
[53:54] adding a a little bit
[53:56] more and then we go to the next chapter
[53:58] and just adds a little bit more to the
[54:01] story you know sometimes just read that
[54:03] away and say you know I found that how
[54:06] about do and you'll find out that some
[54:08] of these things are repeated a good many
[54:10] times right I believe I think mistaken
[54:13] this head in different things is about
[54:16] four times the Book of Revelation if F
[54:18] mistaken I got it written somewhere but
[54:20] it talks about the head and the crowns
[54:22] and the mountains and the thing see it's
[54:24] just keeps unfolding right amen here's a
[54:28] beast all right but then that
[54:32] Beast is
[54:34] sitting
[54:36] where on Seven Hills right
[54:42] y see then this keeps
[54:46] unfolding and that setting on Seven Hill
[54:49] we read me is
[54:54] what yep Rome sits on Seven Hills that's
[54:59] right you say Cincinnati well how
[55:03] old it's on Seven Hills Frome it
[55:09] is but it's just like figuring out your
[55:15] name Richard whatever Marlo might figure
[55:18] out to be
[55:22] 666 right you're name may be and mean in
[55:27] Roman numerals numbers 666 but you're
[55:31] not trying to rule the
[55:33] world and like the prophet says
[55:37] Cincinnati is not a
[55:41] church right and there's no way
[55:44] Cincinnati is trying to rule the world
[55:46] right no so then all right we just let
[55:48] the prophet break it down to simple
[55:51] terminologies and then we we look at it
[55:54] in the correct way
[55:55] you know uh I forgot I was looking the
[55:57] other day CU I got it down on the 666
[56:00] but some head of some great uh religious
[56:03] movement I'll bring it when I think it
[56:05] their name figured out to be 666 when
[56:07] the people was trying to figure it out
[56:09] but that's still mine may be that
[56:13] but you might run back William Mari and
[56:15] brandom and find it to be
[56:18] 666 I don't think it is because of the
[56:20] Roman numerals you know
[56:23] but
[56:26] he's not trying to rule the
[56:28] world so we're finding out these things
[56:31] but seeing that it's not somewhere else
[56:33] amen that's right seeing it unfold is
[56:36] being right here Among Us amen the
[56:40] things that we as organized religion
[56:42] people looked at until the prophet came
[56:45] is now already he said even been
[56:48] fulfilled are being fulfilled well you
[56:51] know that should give you Joy amen amen
[56:55] you know if I wasn't even a born again
[56:58] Christian and you would hand me the
[57:00] Bible with this understanding that I
[57:03] could
[57:04] follow and see these things
[57:07] unveil I want to read it cuz it give me
[57:10] a great understanding of History
[57:12] especially if I take the Book of
[57:13] Revelation and see the the Greeks the me
[57:16] of Persians and things coming down and
[57:19] coming on down to the 10 toes of Daniel
[57:23] y five Western countries five Eastern
[57:26] countries and I stood Eisen high and Cru

[57:48] wake up amen right and realize the
[57:51] message of the hour as the answer

[58:44] it let's see let's see if we have
[58:46] something go ahead put number two
[58:47] brother Joe and let's see if we can talk
[58:50] about this Seven Hills and and these
[58:53] things for a little bit cuz you remember
[58:55] the Bible says he that ha
[58:57] wisdom see here is the one that has
[58:59] wisdom you know that goes over to where
[59:02] to count the number of the man but yet
[59:03] if he has wisdom he can understand these
[59:05] things and what the seven heads seven
[59:07] mountains on which the woman sit how
[59:09] many Hills how many cities in the world
[59:12] that that a church sits on Seven Hills
[59:14] only one where's that the Vatican City
[59:17] in Rome that right the Bible said that
[59:20] this horrible that made all of the
[59:23] world commit forn ations and brought out
[59:27] a bunch of little daughters to teach
[59:30] about the same thing she did that wasn't
[59:33] as bad as her but they were harlots
[59:37] taught them the same thing said the
[59:40] beginning of the will be a w beginning
[59:44] of it will be a woman or a church
[59:46] sitting on seven heels in Rome I've
[59:50] looked all over the world tell me where
[59:53] it's at a church sitting on seven
[59:56] heels and I'm reading this to the
[59:59] Bible now where is it
[1:00:02] anywhere right now we're not against
[1:00:06] Rome right right amen I have no problems
[1:00:12] with it may be L way say I'd rather have
[1:00:15] them here than have beer joints on every
[1:00:16] corner
[1:00:18] right I'd rather have the Catholic I'd
[1:00:20] rather have a denominational Church
[1:00:21] sitting right over here than have a be
[1:00:23] CH setting down
[1:00:25] especially on Saturday nights when we
[1:00:26] were having meetings and line I he have

[1:00:43] for the the National Rifle Association
[1:00:45] fighting for the rights of the people
[1:00:46] for guns we' have done lost our guns a
[1:00:48] long time ago right well let them fight
[1:00:51] it out
[1:00:53] right we got no problems right we just
[1:00:56] go on through life trying to get into
[1:00:59] the word to receive from God am yes and
[1:01:02] see what he wants for you and I that's
[1:01:04] right do we need to understand these
[1:01:06] things what do you
[1:01:10] understand or are you looking for some
[1:01:13] great big something somewhere when you
[1:01:15] can look as simple as the prophet can
[1:01:17] read
[1:01:19] it we'll get back to those in a bit when
[1:01:21] he said he got no daughters teach about
[1:01:23] the same thing she did
[1:01:25] that wasn't as bad as her yeah now who
[1:01:27] are that they were harage
[1:01:30] right Methodist Baptist Presbyterian all
[1:01:33] come out of the Catholic church
[1:01:36] amen
[1:01:38] right and see we'll get to it later if
[1:01:41] that's the Beast then we're the image to
[1:01:42] the Beast oh no not
[1:01:48] me there's only one group of people in
[1:01:51] this
[1:01:52] world that is not
[1:01:57] the image to the Beast and that's the
[1:02:00] Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:02] am
[1:02:04] y do you realize then putting it with it
[1:02:07] without any backing up or any remorse or
[1:02:09] what forever to say that the biggest
[1:02:11] portion of people of this message are
[1:02:13] are worse than the Catholic Church CU at
[1:02:15] least the Catholic Church don't teach
[1:02:17] it's all right to have four or five Liv
[1:02:22] right that's right so I don't throw off
[1:02:25] out there I'm preaching here
[1:02:27] amen I'm talking to you and I now on the
[1:02:30] internet they're listening that's okay
[1:02:33] but I'm not Pastor for
[1:02:35] that I'm just trying to help us all to
[1:02:38] see the truth right man let see where
[1:02:41] we're at look at the next
[1:02:44] one why are we not a
[1:02:47] denomination 58 927 paragraph
[1:02:51] 60 and here it is here is and here is
[1:02:54] the mind which has wisdom the seven
[1:02:56] heads are seven mountains on which the
[1:02:58] woman sth now that's on over in the
[1:03:00] scripture one day we'll get over that
[1:03:02] far okay watch now there is only one
[1:03:06] city that I know of in the world there's
[1:03:07] two cities that I know of that has seven
[1:03:11] or more Mountains in it Cincinnati is
[1:03:13] one of them now I don't understand this
[1:03:16] what it means but he evidently did he
[1:03:19] said which is supposed to be the fiction
[1:03:21] story of Cincinnati it's the mother wol
[1:03:24] now I don't know what that mean I didn't
[1:03:26] look that up you know that so but but
[1:03:29] it's has more than that in it but
[1:03:32] there's no one Church
[1:03:35] denominates Cincinnati there's only one
[1:03:37] place in the world that has a church
[1:03:39] sitting on seven heels that dominates
[1:03:41] the entire world
[1:03:43] right right you know that in World War
[1:03:46] II you were allowed to fire on all of
[1:03:49] the other parts of the country but could
[1:03:52] not fire shot toward the Vatican go back
[1:03:56] and listen to you older
[1:03:58] brothers they wouldn't allow
[1:04:02] them they already had control right they
[1:04:06] got control of the world
[1:04:09] y right you say well they'll get
[1:04:13] us
[1:04:16] okay
[1:04:18] but they can't get us till God gets
[1:04:21] through amen that's right and when God
[1:04:23] gets through with us we're going under
[1:04:25] that's right so I'm not scared right
[1:04:30] amen I I don't go out on the street
[1:04:33] corners with the thing on my back
[1:04:35] Catholic Church is the Beast and the
[1:04:37] denominations is a mark of the beast I
[1:04:41] don't think there's no need of that
[1:04:43] no cuz ain't nobody going to look at it
[1:04:47] they just going to make fun of
[1:04:49] you it's not going to help
[1:04:51] anything we're already open to the
[1:04:54] internet I mean what we're saying is
[1:04:55] worldwide they can use it anytime they
[1:04:57] wish that's right amen and hear anytime
[1:05:00] they wish right but I have nothing
[1:05:03] against the
[1:05:04] Catholic I have nothing against the
[1:05:07] Protestants
[1:05:08] right you know I have great friends that
[1:05:11] are denominational people right we do
[1:05:14] anything in the world for
[1:05:16] me I'm not against that I'm against the
[1:05:19] denomination that's in this message
[1:05:22] that's destroying the people of this
[1:05:25] smash that's the denomination I'm
[1:05:28] against
[1:05:30] right but just think about
[1:05:39] it look at these crayons go to number
[1:05:42] four and look at these crayons that we
[1:05:44] read of because remember what did it
[1:05:46] have had seven heads 10 horns and upon
[1:05:51] the horns 10 crowns
[1:05:55] all right the crowns what do they
[1:05:56] represent the mark of the beast 1954
[1:05:59] 513 and the 10 horns which thou sawest
[1:06:02] are 10
[1:06:04] Kings which have received no kingdoms as
[1:06:08] yet that's up in the scripture you but
[1:06:11] receive power as kings one hour with the
[1:06:13] Beast watch it and who would ever
[1:06:16] thought about this being oh if we just
[1:06:19] had received no powers yet in case you
[1:06:23] just see people
[1:06:24] this is King so and so and that's King
[1:06:26] so and so and all at once you run out of
[1:06:29] Kings y
[1:06:32] right you don't have enough 10 to go
[1:06:34] around CU really is the king of England
[1:06:38] still alive and I know the queen queen
[1:06:40] see but the king's not
[1:06:43] alive you don't have a king in the world
[1:06:46] of any country you said well someone
[1:06:49] throw over and someone throws a king H
[1:06:51] what are
[1:06:52] they receive no power yet they're not
[1:06:55] Kings they didn't have the they T the
[1:06:57] horns didn't have
[1:07:00] crowns they receive power like kings
[1:07:04] what is it dictators not Crown Kings
[1:07:08] dictators what's every country
[1:07:10] controlled by
[1:07:12] now
[1:07:13] right
[1:07:16] dictators y you don't have any place
[1:07:18] where they vote
[1:07:20] kings are you can have little people
[1:07:22] that believe oh I'm the king of this I'm
[1:07:24] the king of that Napoleon too you know
[1:07:27] with his hand
[1:07:30] but they're
[1:07:33] dictators look around the world now
[1:07:35] going to the next one number
[1:07:37] five the nextage why we are honor
[1:07:40] denominations this is paragraph 71
[1:07:43] they're not Crown Kings they're
[1:07:44] dictators see they never were Crown
[1:07:46] Kings but they Reed power as kings one
[1:07:49] hour in the reain of the beast that's
[1:07:52] just in this little sh we time right
[1:07:55] now where dictators are rising up see
[1:07:59] receive power as kings one hour with the
[1:08:01] Beast now if they receive power with the
[1:08:03] King that means in the tribulation so
[1:08:05] we're not there yet so he says look what
[1:08:07] they're doing now see they're rising up
[1:08:11] little
[1:08:12] dictatorships rising
[1:08:15] up right all these little countries have
[1:08:17] dictators over
[1:08:21] them yep you know it would take here
[1:08:24] that could be a coupe any time you
[1:08:26] wanted to take and and somebody could
[1:08:28] kill the president and the vice
[1:08:29] president and take over this country and
[1:08:30] it would be a
[1:08:35] dictatorship I mean you have a coupe
[1:08:37] over in the country and the guy pushes
[1:08:38] another fell out right you know what I
[1:08:42] mean we just have them
[1:08:46] voted we just vote to push him out
[1:08:49] yeah right what's the
[1:08:52] difference
[1:08:58] when Kennedy was killed I wonder what
[1:09:00] the newspapers overseas
[1:09:02] wrote Coupe in process in
[1:09:07] America they killed the
[1:09:09] president you see Church come on
[1:09:14] yeah just get him a point look at the
[1:09:16] next one CU this is one I like which is
[1:09:18] paragraph 88 of the why are we not and
[1:09:22] what's that now these 10
[1:09:25] horns these 10 kingdoms see that's where
[1:09:29] everything falling
[1:09:32] in now I dropped off a point back up in
[1:09:36] my
[1:09:37] mind if this is in the tribulation
[1:09:39] period Then a lot of these dictators
[1:09:41] have not risen the power yet
[1:09:46] right you know that we as I was telling
[1:09:49] them last night in the Bible
[1:09:51] study we are trying to buy
[1:09:54] the Friendship of the world right to
[1:09:57] keep communism from taking over a
[1:09:59] country we go in and we literally Wipe
[1:10:03] Out the
[1:10:04] ruler oh no we don't do that we're
[1:10:09] Christian garbage can
[1:10:12] amen we kill more people than
[1:10:18] anybody you want a little
[1:10:21] statement if we're the image to the
[1:10:23] Beast and nobody can fight against us
[1:10:25] who do you think is ruling the world
[1:10:27] right now I'll get back to
[1:10:30] that you know that there's not a country
[1:10:32] in the world capable of rising up
[1:10:35] against us if they would turn us loose
[1:10:40] right
[1:10:42] right not a country in the world could
[1:10:45] survive cuz we've got the bombs we got
[1:10:48] the equipment that's why we're the image
[1:10:50] to the
[1:10:52] Beast
[1:10:54] Y and you and I are a part of
[1:10:57] that that's
[1:11:01] right
[1:11:03] okay
[1:11:06] listen look what he
[1:11:08] says that's everything falling in what
[1:11:11] these dictators are what's the way
[1:11:12] dictators lean to where is it leaning
[1:11:16] to are they going to lean towards the
[1:11:18] United
[1:11:20] States we're buying them right we're
[1:11:23] buying countries we're putting in people
[1:11:26] in countries to rule those countries
[1:11:28] right and giving them all kind of money
[1:11:30] billions of dollars going but if
[1:11:33] remember in the tribulation the United
[1:11:36] States is blown to
[1:11:38] peace so they won't be coming to us for
[1:11:44] money right if you fall want my point
[1:11:48] this is in the tribulation and the
[1:11:49] tribulation is not going to be the Great
[1:11:51] American economy ruling the world
[1:11:55] the American economy is going to be gone
[1:11:57] that's right so they're going to go to
[1:11:59] Communism right you said well we know
[1:12:02] communism can't rule the world that's
[1:12:04] right but it'll get ready to blow Rome
[1:12:06] off the map that is true brother R said
[1:12:09] communism will never rule the world but
[1:12:11] he said Russia put a bomb right in the
[1:12:13] Vatican one of these
[1:12:17] days so just
[1:12:20] think what's the way dictator gan where
[1:12:23] is it leaning to it's like tell me a
[1:12:25] dictator that doesn't lean to work
[1:12:27] communism and see they shall what hate
[1:12:30] the the woman the church but watch
[1:12:32] what going to do it I love thee they
[1:12:35] shall hate the and shall make her
[1:12:38] desolate and naked and shall eat her
[1:12:40] flesh and burn her with fire that's
[1:12:42] what's going to happen
[1:12:44] right to
[1:12:47] Rome and
[1:12:51] America because we are are the image to
[1:12:54] the
[1:12:57] Beast
[1:12:59] sensible right right
[1:13:05] right they' got head on their head's a
[1:13:08] name of blaspheming they don't need to
[1:13:10] run this up but what is blaspheming the
[1:13:12] brother around said is this to make fun
[1:13:14] of ridicule talk
[1:13:17] about you think the world don't ridicule
[1:13:19] in life about America sure
[1:13:25] and you know the biggest point of their
[1:13:27] laughing is the American people and the
[1:13:30] way we live and the way we do and call
[1:13:32] ourselves Christians right the way we
[1:13:35] dress and our actions and reactions
[1:13:40] yep name a
[1:13:47] Bless but where's it at to just get to
[1:13:51] point cuz we'll get the whole we'll go
[1:13:53] back and furthermore
[1:13:55] cover but you know Revelations 13 is a
[1:13:58] very odd
[1:14:02] thing and that's the United
[1:14:05] States of
[1:14:10] America is Revelations
[1:14:15] 13 and yet you and I are a part of
[1:14:22] it H you high up L people getting sleepy
[1:14:25] on me today so wake up ain't coming down
[1:14:28] with a pencil and F
[1:14:34] you Revelations
[1:14:39] 13 is
[1:14:44] America listen to your definition go
[1:14:46] ahead brother pull up number
[1:14:48] eight listen to the definition your
[1:14:51] Prophet gives the Hebrew series chapter
[1:14:52] 4 5 7901 paragraph 102 10 I mean 103 104
[1:14:58] did you notice this United States is
[1:15:00] number
[1:15:01] 13 and everything it
[1:15:03] does you know it was established the
[1:15:06] 13th
[1:15:08] colony colonies you know the flag had 13
[1:15:11] stars in it
[1:15:13] first you know everything that the
[1:15:15] United States does in a is a number does
[1:15:19] in a number 13 Did You Know It appears
[1:15:22] in the Bible in re aans the 13 certainly
[1:15:25] does the Little Beast the lamb that come
[1:15:28] up out of the water not thickness in
[1:15:30] multitudes of people not out of the
[1:15:33] water but out of a land where there's no
[1:15:35] one see one of them comes up out of the
[1:15:38] land so it's certainly not a water beast
[1:15:40] and it's
[1:15:42] people it had two little
[1:15:46] horns this animal in the Book of
[1:15:48] Revelation has two little horn civil and
[1:15:50] ecclesiastical Powers that's right
[1:15:54] right and he was a lamb freedom of
[1:15:57] religion is that where we came here and
[1:16:00] after a while they
[1:16:01] w't after a while they went together and
[1:16:04] he spoke like a dragon and exercise all
[1:16:07] the power that Rome did before him in
[1:16:10] other
[1:16:11] words all the power of Rome will be
[1:16:14] invested into that little lamb that's in
[1:16:17] America we're the only one that can
[1:16:19] control the world
[1:16:22] folks God has designed it that
[1:16:26] way what about a people and we're
[1:16:28] policing probably a half of it with our
[1:16:32] troops
[1:16:35] right that's coming to our nation you
[1:16:37] mark it down you watch to the
[1:16:39] Confederate of
[1:16:40] churches and the Catholic unite together
[1:16:44] Confederation of church and Catholic

[1:26:12] and how they would be I had them draw
[1:26:15] out on the board up there in church Ages
[1:26:17] which you see here draw out in a book
[1:26:21] and if that hold it Spirit didn't come
[1:26:23] down in a pillar of fire and went right
[1:26:25] back there on the wall and draw them out
[1:26:29] himself while 3 or 400 people sitting
[1:26:33] looking and just as the Poke started
[1:26:35] over here the moon somehow blacked
[1:26:40] out now what was draw out didn't become
[1:26:42] into reality right the moon blacked out

[1:27:21] steps
[1:27:24] Y and hey folks when he lands in the
[1:27:28] country he gets down and kisses the
[1:27:30] ground not because he's so
[1:27:33] humble everywhere he goes he's claiming
[1:27:36] that
[1:27:38] territory that's right for his
[1:27:41] own we get into the image of the Beast
[1:27:43] and see more where we're at but just
[1:27:45] think about it
[1:27:47] man we're right in the middle of the
[1:27:50] biggest thing m of taking
[1:27:53] place all forms and parts and looking
[1:27:57] for it wondering yeah
[1:28:01] you and I've for a year now I've noticed
[1:28:04] one
[1:28:05] thing that seemingly there even for a
[1:28:08] couple of years more seemingly there's
[1:28:10] not a lot of persecutions and things
[1:28:12] going on there's kind of a love a kind
[1:28:14] of a backing off maybe look like I don't
[1:28:17] know cuz I watch those things and I you
[1:28:20] know I'm not a doom day preacher but I
[1:28:24] watch and see it looks like that
[1:28:25] everything is kind of have you noticed
[1:28:27] it thing people just don't argue with
[1:28:29] you no more you know to get a good F
[1:28:31] you'd have to go down and start one you
[1:28:33] know what I me
[1:28:34] spiritually there people just don't come
[1:28:36] and looking for you they don't coming
[1:28:38] badly I thought when we opened up on the
[1:28:40] internet that I done told these brothers
[1:28:43] I said be ready that computer's going to
[1:28:45] be burning hot cuz when I say this is
[1:28:48] what the prophet said they're going
[1:28:50] to we're going to be getting quotes from
[1:28:52] all over the
[1:28:54] world surprise
[1:28:58] me I can get up here and say about
[1:29:00] anything I want to and ain't nobody
[1:29:02] calling me and telling me I'm
[1:29:05] wrong you say well you want to no I
[1:29:09] don't want to I was just expecting it
[1:29:11] right you
[1:29:13] know but you see there's always a love
[1:29:17] just before the stor that's right y just
[1:29:20] before things starts ripping rough is
[1:29:23] always a love you get in a hurricane and
[1:29:26] when the eye crosses you don't run out
[1:29:29] yeah and say it's over with it'll be so
[1:29:32] quiet and peaceful till you think it's
[1:29:35] all finished but the worst part is
[1:29:38] coming amen the rest of the storm right
[1:29:42] I'm not I'm not a doomsday preacher
[1:29:43] somebody's preaching this that other I
[1:29:45] want to get out of hereen I want to go
[1:29:47] out of
[1:29:49] here I I want a Rapture to take place to
[1:29:52] carry me out of here to get me out of
[1:29:54] this world and
[1:29:56] life but also realize that while I'm
[1:30:00] here that there things that are to take
[1:30:03] place right amen and us being in
[1:30:07] America is a wonderful
[1:30:09] thing because this is where the Prophet
[1:30:12] brought his message amen what if this
[1:30:15] message I'm not throwing off on these
[1:30:16] countries I'm I'm just talking okay what
[1:30:19] if the brother Rand have been born in a
[1:30:21] third world country
[1:30:22] reform the message could have never been
[1:30:24] put out no that's
[1:30:26] right think so God could have took care
[1:30:29] of it I know he did he brought him to
[1:30:30] America that's what he took care of okay
[1:30:34] he put him in America where the money
[1:30:37] would be Y and like I said we're the
[1:30:39] smallest country we were talking
[1:30:41] yesterday and they said how many we got
[1:30:43] about 380 million 380 million China got
[1:30:47] a billion China's got over a billion
[1:30:50] India's got over a billion
[1:30:52] put Africa all back in the HK together
[1:30:54] how many billions would they have 7
[1:30:56] billion people in the
[1:30:58] world and we just a little handful but
[1:31:01] yet we right at this moment are
[1:31:04] controlling the world
[1:31:06] right who's the first one that goes when
[1:31:09] a country Rises
[1:31:13] up I thought the UN was everybody to go
[1:31:16] at one
[1:31:17] time we
[1:31:20] go we bomb we do cuz nobody can make war
[1:31:26] against this beast and it's the image to
[1:31:29] the
[1:31:32] Beast we control the
[1:31:35] world we get his fight going down y okay
[1:31:39] that's right praise the lord we see the
[1:31:41] truth amen the only thing I'm trying to
[1:31:43] get you and I to see is don't look at
[1:31:46] the Bible essay and we can't understand
[1:31:48] the Book of Revelation it's in these
[1:31:50] symbols and things
[1:31:52] well we had a prophet to break the
[1:31:55] symbol now we can read the book amen and
[1:31:59] enjoy reading it right and find
[1:32:04] ourselves now to find myself as the bad
[1:32:07] is not too good but to find myself on
[1:32:11] the good side
[1:32:14] right you know God don't need but
[1:32:17] one
[1:32:19] person that's all he needs
[1:32:24] he went down to Egypt and whipped Egypt
[1:32:26] with one man and a stick that's right
[1:32:28] that's right that you don't need a world
[1:32:31] full of
[1:32:32] people you just need somebody to believe
[1:32:36] him I want to do that don't you let's
[1:32:38] stand together we go into the communion
[1:32:40] got everything
[1:32:44] ready
