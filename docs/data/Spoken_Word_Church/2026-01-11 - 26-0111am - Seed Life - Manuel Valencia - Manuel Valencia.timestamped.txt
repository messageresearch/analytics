[0:35] to make ready. Father, her the bride has
[0:37] made herself ready. So we pray that you
[0:39] would just help us, Father, with these
[0:40] portion of the words that we'll be
[0:42] reading today and we'll be teaching and
[0:44] expounding, Father, that it would uh
[0:46] prepare our hearts, Father, for worship
[0:48] and then for the preaching of the word
[0:49] later this morning. We ask these things
[0:51] in the mighty name of the Lord and
[0:53] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the
[0:56] Lord. See if this thing connects right
[0:59] in.
[1:01] Two.
[1:14] [clears throat]
[1:15] Wonderful. So, this this morning we're
[1:17] going to be talking about seed life.
[1:20] you know, the life that's in the seed,
[1:23] how the word is a seed, typifying uh the
[1:25] the plant life, the botanical life, the
[1:27] the different uh sources of life and
[1:30] plant types of lives, and how God said
[1:32] it all from the beginning. So, you know,
[1:35] and the question I I want to ask
[1:37] ourselves is why seed?
[1:40] Why did life have to come by way of
[1:42] seed? you know in the plant life we see
[1:45] and animal human god's word it just
[1:50] think about that you know ask yourselves
[1:52] you know why didn't it come in another
[1:53] way you have rocks we have other forms
[1:55] of life
[1:57] you have different things that that are
[2:00] didn't come by the way of seed in in the
[2:01] creation but if you really group what
[2:04] really did come by seed it just really
[2:07] puts it into perspective you know why
[2:08] why did it have to come by seed you know
[2:10] why did humans have to come and
[2:11] reproduce by seed why seed you know so
[2:14] again the topic being seed life so in my
[2:19] study I found these types of seed
[2:22] there's another one I'll touch upon uh
[2:23] here uh throughout but most basic form
[2:28] and even how the Bible starts it starts
[2:30] off with plants starts off with
[2:31] botanical life you know it says let
[2:33] their earth yield uh grass and trees so
[2:37] you have plant life they have the seed
[2:39] of plant life and I think it's so
[2:40] beautiful how it says that whose seed
[2:42] seed is in itself and it's a
[2:45] reproduction and it's the original life
[2:47] and then you have animal life then we
[2:50] have human life and then you have the
[2:51] seed of God Christ the word
[2:55] &gt;&gt; but then there's the seed of discrepancy
[2:57] brother Brandham also toned it the seed
[2:59] of the serpent so see follow the seed
[3:02] the seed line and it's just amazing to
[3:05] see as we read these scriptures just put
[3:07] that into perspective sometimes we're
[3:08] talking about these different forms of
[3:10] of seed and it's just amazing how life
[3:13] had to come by a little tiny little
[3:15] thing by seed. And I'll do a little type
[3:18] and a little contrast right now with
[3:20] something that the closest thing man has
[3:22] been able to come up with and that is
[3:23] like a microchip, right? Something that
[3:25] is got artificial life or not life,
[3:29] intelligence, something that's got
[3:31] function if you will and that we use. It
[3:33] was man-made and it can accomplish a lot
[3:35] and they can make them real small. But
[3:37] see it's just it's it's it doesn't it
[3:39] falls short from the real life from the
[3:41] original life anything of course that we
[3:43] create and of course there's also where
[3:44] you take take a seed or plant life and
[3:46] you modify or you pervert it or you
[3:49] genetically engineer it and how it comes
[3:52] with limitations how it it it stops and
[3:54] it might not reproduce itself after the
[3:56] second and and so forth. So it it just
[3:59] let's just look about the seed. Let's
[4:00] let's let's talk about
[4:03] how precious it is that God decided to
[4:05] reproduce plant, animal, humans,
[4:08] and even the the enemy, right? Um tries
[4:11] to copy that and then himself, God um
[4:14] through through a seed in type. So
[4:18] living things I I I wanted to put a kids
[4:20] dictionary uh definition for just life
[4:23] or living things. So, keep it real
[4:25] simple is living things are I remember
[4:28] helping my daughter in um about two
[4:30] years ago in a in a school project and
[4:32] she was trying to define what living
[4:33] things were and we came up with a simple
[4:35] thing was just things that and the word
[4:37] reproduce is is big on that but things
[4:39] that it's organisms that can grow so
[4:41] like a rock right cannot grow itself uh
[4:44] move breathe or or take in nutrients and
[4:47] reproduce themselves. So, I just I like
[4:50] it. I think it's simple, right? It's
[4:51] it's something that's got to have a
[4:53] little bit of movement. It's got to have
[4:54] uh grow and it's got to be able to uh
[4:57] change shape [clears throat] and form
[4:59] and it's got to be able to reproduce but
[5:00] it's got to have these different factors
[5:02] at the same time
[5:04] &gt;&gt; right so I put a depiction here so you
[5:06] can just be clear in our mind you have
[5:09] the plant right that that um all grass
[5:12] all everything it comes from a seed
[5:14] everything we see all the beautiful
[5:15] landscapes you know housed in a mountain
[5:18] and a valley flowers
[5:21] God chose to come in the form of a seed.
[5:25] Then we have, you know, animal life,
[5:27] right? And it reproduces after its own
[5:29] kind. Then we have human life depicted
[5:32] here by a mother holding a baby, right?
[5:35] But then we have, you know, a new birth
[5:38] by the individual and depicted here by
[5:40] somebody reading their Bible, receiving
[5:42] the life of Christ. And then then we
[5:45] have, you know, believers sharing and
[5:48] and bringing forth the word in other
[5:50] believers, right? of course, God God
[5:52] doing the work.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; So, I just think that's that's really
[5:55] what what um God had an interest in the
[5:58] seed. You when you read the Bible, um I
[6:00] was astonished there was like 257 just
[6:02] hits just for the word seed. That's not
[6:04] looking into other words like offsprings
[6:06] or errors and other words that mean the
[6:10] same thing. And I was just uh amazed
[6:12] when I was reading how much care God
[6:15] takes to protect the seed and the seed
[6:17] line. And sometimes people were called
[6:20] seed themselves. And it says and and
[6:22] then it brought forth uh seed meaning
[6:25] even though it's already born but they
[6:26] still call him seed. So I just think
[6:28] it's beautiful um how God chose to bring
[6:32] forth life through seed on the plants on
[6:34] the animals on humans on a Christian a
[6:36] believer. And um again the enemy wants
[6:38] to copy that by the seed of discrepancy
[6:40] and the seed of serpent the serpent
[6:42] seed. So just taking a step back here we
[6:45] have uh Genesis 1:11. And the first time
[6:47] the word seed I found it says, "And God
[6:49] said, let the earth bring forth grass,
[6:52] the herb yielding seed, and the fruit
[6:54] tree yielding fruit after its kind,
[6:57] whose seed is in itself." So that was
[7:01] the miracle of reproduction, right? That
[7:03] it just wouldn't stop there. It's that
[7:06] same seed that once was
[7:09] could have procreated all the orange
[7:11] trees we know. And to me that's powerful
[7:14] is is to is to have that kind of a
[7:17] adaptive life source where housed in a
[7:20] little pocket in a little in a in a
[7:23] little bag of a seed that is that it's
[7:26] lays there and it's able to bring out
[7:28] everything that was in it and then whose
[7:30] seed is in itself upon the earth and it
[7:32] was so and God blessed them. So this is
[7:36] now the man and God said unto them be
[7:38] fruitful and multiply. This is a
[7:40] commandment that was given. This is
[7:41] before the u the incident had happened
[7:43] and replenish the earth and it says to
[7:46] sub subdue it right over the fish of the
[7:48] and the the animals of the earth and all
[7:50] that.
[7:51] And then once once it starts getting
[7:53] interesting is when he says in Genesis
[7:55] 3:15 it says and God excuse me and I God
[7:59] uh will put enmity between thee talking
[8:03] of the serpent that's the serpent the
[8:05] woman
[8:07] and between thy seed and her seed. And
[8:10] I'll show an example here. Of course,
[8:12] it's depicted as her seed because it was
[8:13] talking about the woman. We know is is
[8:15] the seed of of human. And it says uh and
[8:18] later on we know that brother random
[8:20] says that seed was Christ, right? And it
[8:22] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[8:25] bruise his heel. So just to depict here
[8:27] how even though it talked about the
[8:29] woman seed in this place and another
[8:31] place I found that it called it the
[8:33] woman conceive the seed but we know of
[8:36] course the seed come from comes from the
[8:37] male. It says, "Speak unto the children
[8:39] of Israel, saying, if a woman have
[8:41] conceived seed, see, so it's saying her
[8:43] seed because it was a seed that was in
[8:45] her at the time and born a man child,
[8:47] you know, and then it goes on to say
[8:48] that it would be unclean for seven days
[8:50] and so forth, days of separations in the
[8:52] law." So, and then there's another place
[8:53] where it kept on calling it the woman
[8:55] seed, but as we know, everywhere else in
[8:57] the Bible, it talks about the man men
[9:00] having the seed. And here we find in
[9:03] Genesis 4:25, "And Adam knew his wife
[9:06] again, and she bare a son, and called
[9:09] his name Seth, for God said, she the
[9:13] woman hath appointed me another seed."
[9:16] See, instead of Abel, whom Cain slew,
[9:20] and this is where, if you know, the
[9:22] distinction between the seeds started to
[9:24] be made known,
[9:25] &gt;&gt; appointed me another seed.
[9:28] And it says in Genesis 7:3 of fowls also
[9:32] of the air by sevens. This is a time of
[9:34] Noah and the male and the female to keep
[9:37] seed alive upon the face of all the
[9:40] earth. So God was very careful to keep
[9:42] all the seed alive in in in the flood
[9:46] right humanly speaking the animals and
[9:49] as of course we know the the uh the
[9:51] plant life was able to sustain itself.
[9:54] And in here um this is an example where
[9:57] a promise being made for seed for Noah
[9:59] and then also for Abraham in the same
[10:01] page here. So God spake unto Noah and to
[10:04] his sons with him saying and I behold I
[10:10] established my covenant with you and
[10:13] with your seed after you. And to Abraham
[10:16] said and behold to me thou hast given no
[10:20] seed. He said, "And Abraham said,
[10:23] behold, to me, thou has given no seed,
[10:26] and lo, one born in my house is my
[10:29] heir."
[10:31] So, it's just amazing how the seed the
[10:34] seed uh the Bible talks so much about
[10:36] the seed in in six Genesis 16 says, "And
[10:39] the angel of the Lord said unto her, I
[10:41] will multiply that seed exceedingly that
[10:44] it shall not be numbered for the
[10:46] multitudes." We know that promise was
[10:47] also made to to Abraham.
[10:51] And in Exodus we find where it says and
[10:53] the house of Israel called the name
[10:55] thereof mana and it was like coriander
[10:59] seed white and the taste of it was like
[11:02] wafers made with honey. So in the Bible
[11:06] it speaks a lot about seed. It speaks a
[11:09] lot about different plants of seed and I
[11:11] I didn't have time to look into all the
[11:12] the details of that but I just know that
[11:15] that mana itself right the type of the
[11:18] word is also here being uh um it's being
[11:22] typified as a seed as a coriander seed.
[11:27] So let's look at this illustration here.
[11:30] So you'll see in the on the picture
[11:31] there's a a seed and then there's like a
[11:32] a small tree or a ceiling. This is a
[11:35] quote from brother Brandon where it
[11:36] says, "Let us see God and the word is
[11:38] like a seed." That was from Luke. And
[11:40] then he's skipping. He says, "Did you
[11:42] know that every orange that will ever be
[11:45] in that tree is in it when it's just
[11:49] about one inch tall?"
[11:52] Did you know that? Sure. It is where it
[11:55] comes from the seed. See, now the only
[11:59] thing it is is just planted out, set
[12:02] out. And in the same message in the same
[12:05] the next verse it says the next quote it
[12:07] says and it was to and it has to draw it
[12:11] it sucks water from the earth and gets
[12:14] nourishment and when it drinks in water
[12:17] it pushes out limbs drinks in more water
[12:20] pushes out leaves drinks in more water
[12:23] pushes out blossom drinks in more water
[12:26] pushes out oranges. It just keeps
[12:28] drinking and pushing out and it has to
[12:32] drink. Just reminds me so much, right?
[12:34] The to encourage us, right, that once
[12:37] you've been born of God, right, you just
[12:38] have to be drinking of his life,
[12:40] partaking, you know, being washed by the
[12:42] water of the word, just continue to draw
[12:44] new nutrients and nourishment like the
[12:46] sheep, right? Where he doesn't have to
[12:48] worry about reproducing wool. You just
[12:50] have to, you know, walk this life, be
[12:53] connected to to him, just keep on
[12:56] drinking and pushing out. I just think
[12:58] it's beautiful that in here it says that
[13:00] all the many bullshos of oranges that
[13:02] were ever going to be was at one time in
[13:04] something the size of of a seed.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; And and to me, it's just a the mystery
[13:09] that all life as we know it has come
[13:11] with something that uh it's a seed and
[13:14] those forms of organisms we spoke about.
[13:17] In Psalm 37 says, "For the Lord loveth
[13:19] judgment and forsaketh not his saints,"
[13:22] that's his seed.
[13:24] They are preserved forever.
[13:29] But the seed of the wicked, it shall be
[13:31] cut off. I was doing a little study to
[13:33] find out like if you put seed and if you
[13:35] bury it and if it does not bring forth
[13:37] if if it and for the most part they
[13:40] don't necessarily rotten is what I read.
[13:42] they can actually just remain there and
[13:45] then you know they can bring forth life
[13:47] in the future. That to me that was an
[13:49] encouragement to know that that you know
[13:53] with situations with wayward ones with
[13:56] loved ones it's just to be patient right
[13:59] &gt;&gt; and and and God's word will do the work
[14:02] right it's like somebody said you know
[14:04] you don't just plant a seed and then
[14:05] bury it back up to see if it's it's
[14:07] coming alive you just got to commit it
[14:08] because if it's not coming in in this
[14:10] season it might come in in the very next
[14:11] one
[14:12] &gt;&gt; that's right
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen's word said so he said let there be
[14:15] light as we heard brother random in the
[14:17] message this morning.
[14:19] He spoke these things into existence. I
[14:21] remember a brother um retirement age and
[14:24] he had a in Arizona, you know, it's it's
[14:26] hard to grow anything in Arizona, but he
[14:28] had a the most luscious 2acres I've ever
[14:30] seen in Arizona ever.
[14:33] They're full of green grass, all kinds
[14:35] of trees, and then just he pointed out
[14:37] to the to the tree and he says, you
[14:39] know, that's that's the word of God
[14:40] manifested there. He said you know God
[14:42] spoke that let he said everything it's
[14:45] that verse that he says let it seed be
[14:46] with in itself
[14:48] &gt;&gt; God's word original seed he said that he
[14:51] literally that's God's spoken word right
[14:53] there manifested
[14:54] &gt;&gt; right
[14:55] &gt;&gt; and it just really spoke to me much you
[14:56] know because he he had that conviction
[14:58] and that faith
[14:59] &gt;&gt; how much more are we able to say about
[15:01] ourselves right once we've been of
[15:02] course we had the human life but when
[15:04] we've been b born by his spirit
[15:06] &gt;&gt; right so I like this
[15:11] message quote the great warrior 55 David
[15:15] did if you said to me brother Brandham
[15:17] give me an oak tree it says you're from
[15:21] down in southern Indiana where they have
[15:23] the big white oak and so forth give me
[15:26] an oak tree and I'll give you an acorn
[15:30] well you've got a oak tree potentially
[15:34] it is in the seed form but it's an oak
[15:38] tree
[15:40] you've got say but but it's an oak tree
[15:43] you've got it in an acorn when we take
[15:46] God's word we got it in seed form
[15:51] when we can accept divine healing by
[15:54] God's word that settles it amen
[15:59] we have patience for that right brothers
[16:01] &gt;&gt; sometimes uh that's where we tested a
[16:03] lot because we we've we've been healed
[16:04] we experienced healing but sometimes
[16:06] there's that one thing that just bothers
[16:08] throughout life and you see healing
[16:11] touch and all that but it's just
[16:14] it settles it once you it will grow it
[16:16] will grow it will manifest you know and
[16:18] we know that there's miracles and
[16:19] sometimes there's a process of healing
[16:21] those are the ones that I think require
[16:22] the most faith but that settles it
[16:24] somewhere deep in in the same sentence
[16:27] the next sentence it says take the old
[16:29] acorn and bury in the ground and stand
[16:32] off there and watch her for a little
[16:35] while and she and see what takes takes
[16:37] place, your oak tree comes right up on
[16:40] it. Cut up comes right up with it. It
[16:43] says because the life is in the seed and
[16:46] God's word is a seed and it's alive.
[16:51] See, to me, it's a mystery how much how
[16:54] much life can be compacted in that small
[16:56] little um orange seed. If you can just
[16:59] simply receive it, take it out of the
[17:02] Bible
[17:04] and said, "It means me. By his stripes,
[17:08] I am healed." Right? Amen. Then you got
[17:11] something. See, substance faith. That's
[17:14] right. All the demons could not stop you
[17:17] from it.
[17:19] No matter what anybody would say, you
[17:22] wouldn't believe it because you know
[17:24] where you're standing. Isn't that
[17:27] amazing? When you have that true faith,
[17:28] that conviction. So every time we hit
[17:31] God's word, let's go to planning. You
[17:32] know, we we hear something, you say,
[17:34] "It's me." Plant it in that heart,
[17:37] meditate on it, pray on it, you know,
[17:39] take time outside to yourself
[17:42] and and have faith that it will grow and
[17:44] it will manifest. It is God's word.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Have faith, you know, in the life, the
[17:48] seed life.
[17:50] In Psalms 126, it says, "They that sow
[17:53] in tears shall reap in joy."
[17:56] I always wonder that, you know, why why
[17:58] would a sewer be out there crying and
[18:01] and sewing
[18:03] and one time um this word came alive to
[18:06] me at the time when my father-in-law was
[18:09] um in the process of communicating with
[18:11] me and giving her daughter into marriage
[18:15] and it it just opened up to me. You
[18:17] know, there's certain things that you
[18:19] have to plant in your lives that are
[18:20] harder than others. You know, if you
[18:22] just got a little bit of seed from your
[18:23] neighbor and you're just throwing it
[18:24] out, you're not going to be crying.
[18:26] But if you have something that means is
[18:28] near and dear to you, that means a lot
[18:29] to you,
[18:31] it's different. I I saw this. So it
[18:34] says, "They that sew in tears,
[18:36] you know, shall reap in joy." But it
[18:38] doesn't mean they're not going to sew in
[18:40] tears.
[18:41] Verse six, he that goeth forth and
[18:45] weepeth, bearing precious seed,
[18:48] something that's really precious to you,
[18:52] &gt;&gt; shall doubtless
[18:54] come again with rejoicing, bringing his
[18:57] sheets with him.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. And one time I had a photo
[19:00] with my wife and I in Arizona went to an
[19:02] apple um orchard
[19:06] and I had my wife when she was running
[19:07] with with the daughter and with the son
[19:10] and just running and I took a photo and
[19:12] I put the scripture and I sent it to my
[19:14] father-in-law and said see that's not
[19:16] where you get the the rejoicing part.
[19:18] [laughter]
[19:19] Now that's the she's part you know when
[19:22] um you had to go through all the
[19:23] decision making and the process of
[19:25] believing God for what he was planning
[19:28] you know what he was surrendering and
[19:30] committing to to the ground to you know
[19:32] bring forth more to to giving up and
[19:36] that's just a type now but um I think
[19:38] about it in your life think about
[19:41] why why would you go sewing seed crying
[19:45] or weeping so there are certain things
[19:48] that we We do got to uh we know that
[19:51] later on we'll find out where it says
[19:52] unless a seed
[19:55] is planted and dies it remains alone
[19:59] &gt;&gt; right
[20:00] &gt;&gt; but see but once it sprouts out it
[20:02] brings life
[20:03] &gt;&gt; amen so just just take that in your life
[20:06] you know there are certain things we
[20:07] know that we have to sacrifice that we
[20:10] had to surrender that we had to give up
[20:12] right and at that time you know it's
[20:15] it's um there's there's tears there's
[20:17] weep
[20:18] But just know that if it's um you're
[20:20] doing it in good faith, you know, God
[20:22] will God will honor your faith. In
[20:25] Isaiah 65, it says, "They shall not
[20:28] labor in vain, nor bring forth
[20:31] for trouble, for they are the seed of
[20:35] the blessed of the Lord." See, and their
[20:38] offspring with them. So just again
[20:41] sewing and sewing seed and knowing that
[20:45] it won't be in vain and that the work of
[20:48] the Lord all that you do does not return
[20:52] back to him void.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; It accomplishes what he sent out to to
[20:55] do.
[20:57] Acts 13:23 of this man's seed hath God
[21:01] according to his promise raised unto
[21:05] Israel a savior Jesus. See, this is Paul
[21:09] when he was speaking about David. And
[21:11] you know, if you don't think that seed
[21:13] matters and all that, just think of
[21:14] genealogy. I mean, I just read in
[21:16] Matthew where it um it says that from
[21:17] Abraham to David, it was 14 generations.
[21:21] And from um David to Christ, it says 14
[21:24] generations. Just how precise.
[21:27] I was looking at some of the pilgrim
[21:30] pilgrim um voyage uh of William Brad
[21:34] Ford and of Plymouth Foundation and some
[21:36] of that and just seeing how some of the
[21:38] people that were dropped into the water
[21:40] and were were able to get saved and all
[21:41] that. I'm just thinking how they became
[21:43] like George Washington's you know they
[21:46] were basically George Washington's
[21:48] father you know grandfather or such and
[21:50] so many others that have you know done
[21:52] something in life and just just to think
[21:54] how God had to watch watch your seed
[21:57] line your in the natural right and then
[22:00] in the spiritual as well but just
[22:02] knowing how God preserves the seed and
[22:04] and
[22:06] you you can't um you can't but help to
[22:09] know that it was it was a of course it
[22:11] was God's purpose behind it. It was
[22:12] designed like how can you have 14
[22:14] generations from Abraham to David and
[22:16] promising to David, oh your seed, your
[22:18] seed, your seed and then all the way to
[22:20] David and then your seed, the root of
[22:21] David, uh the root of Jesse, you know,
[22:24] and so forth. And then how precise
[22:27] 14:14. So genealogy, you see that all
[22:30] all played out through Acts 17, it says,
[22:33] "For in him we live, we move." Remember
[22:35] one of the definitions of being alive
[22:36] was something that has uh it's an
[22:38] organism that um that grows that moves
[22:43] that breathe everything that has breath
[22:44] praise the Lord and that can reproduce.
[22:47] Amen. So a rock is not an example of
[22:50] that. A plant, animal, humans are
[22:52] Christians and so forth. For in him we
[22:54] live. So we're a living thing. We move
[22:57] and we have our being like we sustain
[23:01] our being in him. as certain also of
[23:03] your own poet has said, for we are also
[23:06] his offspring. It's just amazing to know
[23:09] that you're God's direct offspring once
[23:11] you're born again,
[23:12] &gt;&gt; born of his spirit. Galatians 3:16, now
[23:15] to Abraham and his seed. So notice
[23:18] there's no S in there where the promise
[23:20] made. He saith not and to seeds with an
[23:24] S meaning multiple as of many but as of
[23:28] one and to thy seed which is Christ.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? I mean to Abraham
[23:34] how amazing it is that he was promised
[23:37] that Christ will be brought about from
[23:40] his seed.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; And you know it's amazing. And it makes
[23:43] you wonder, you know, the miracle that
[23:45] happened when he was able to give him
[23:46] the promise when he couldn't have seed
[23:48] and they were both, I read, fertile. I
[23:51] mean, um, infertile. Both of them were.
[23:54] I read it in the Bible this last night.
[23:56] So, naturally speaking, it was
[23:58] impossible. So, this is some
[24:00] supernatural miracle seed in the natural
[24:02] and in the spiritual
[24:04] &gt;&gt; in this case. Galatians 3:29. And if you
[24:07] be Christ, then are the Abraham seed.
[24:11] And you know to me that's powerful verse
[24:12] because a lot of times we read you know
[24:14] in the Old Testament
[24:16] Abraham and to his seed and to his seed
[24:18] and to his seed and you know a lot of
[24:19] times we feel like we're not Jew right
[24:22] but here it is and if you be Christ then
[24:24] you are Abraham's seed
[24:28] &gt;&gt; with no s and heirs that's seed too
[24:31] according to the promise. So that
[24:33] promise was very supernatural. is God's
[24:36] own word. And again, you know, being
[24:38] born again, it's a Bible term. First
[24:40] Peter 1:23, I know it gets preached a
[24:43] lot because that's what the basis of our
[24:45] faith is, but it it's being born again.
[24:47] It says right here, word for word,
[24:49] &gt;&gt; not of corruptible seed,
[24:52] not of the seed of discrepancy, not of
[24:54] the serpent seed, but of the
[24:56] incorruptible by the word of God, which
[24:59] liveth and abideth forever. So God shows
[25:03] it this way. He's typifying. Just look
[25:04] at a plant. Just have patience. You
[25:07] know, there's a birth seedling
[25:10] germination, right? Seeing then it then
[25:12] it comes forth.
[25:14] You know, take heed what you what you
[25:16] plant. Um my father planted um a tree
[25:20] and it was kind of very small. He said,
[25:21] "You should have just gone with the
[25:22] original seed, you know, with like just
[25:25] go buy an one organic orange instead of
[25:28] he planted an orange tree instead of,
[25:29] you know, the one you bought at the
[25:30] Walmart and then you planted it." So he
[25:33] didn't listen. So he planted it. This is
[25:35] like 20 years ago or more. So he planted
[25:38] it and here he is. He has it. Every two,
[25:41] three years it gets some kind of sour
[25:42] something lemon orange. He knows what it
[25:44] is. It's I know a lot of types of
[25:47] oranges, but this is like I don't even
[25:48] know what it is. I mean I know the lemon
[25:50] orange, lemon, limes and all kinds of
[25:52] things. This is like like this is not
[25:54] even what you call ornamental orange.
[25:55] I'm talking about and sometimes like you
[25:58] squeeze the thing and no juice comes
[26:00] out. And so the only thing that's good
[26:04] for right now is shade. I'll give it
[26:05] that. I mean, my my my mom washes her
[26:07] clothes outside kind of old style with
[26:08] the with the washer. And um they love it
[26:11] because of the shade, but
[26:14] here we are 20, 30 years later and just,
[26:17] you know, it's it's only going to do
[26:18] what was in that seed.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Right. So especially things that are
[26:22] longstanding in your life, let let's
[26:24] plant the good, you know, the good
[26:26] principle
[26:27] &gt;&gt; being born again of the seed incorrupt
[26:29] incorruptible. So Genesis 22, we'll wrap
[26:31] it up here. That in blessings I will
[26:33] bless thee, and in multiplying I will
[26:35] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[26:38] heaven and and and [clears throat] the
[26:39] sand which is upon the seashore and thy
[26:42] seed shall possess the gates of the
[26:44] enemy. So seed of the promises, many
[26:46] promises again born again again here 1
[26:49] John 3:9, whosoever is born of God does
[26:53] not commit sin. That means you don't
[26:54] have that unbelieving nature. For his
[26:57] seed remainth in him
[27:00] and he cannot sin. He cannot doubt as a
[27:04] day in day out from the inside of the
[27:05] soul out because he is born of God.
[27:10] First John 3:9. That's anorthy
[27:11] scripture. 1 John 3:9. And just here, I
[27:16] Jesus very clear who's speaking in
[27:17] Revelations have sent my angel to
[27:19] testify unto thee these things in the
[27:21] churches. So he's the one that sent the
[27:25] the angels to testify in the churches. I
[27:27] am the rude. So first person speaking
[27:30] and the offspring of David. You know
[27:33] what was said in Matthew that from the
[27:34] fourth generation. So that's the seed
[27:37] there. He said I'm the seed of David and
[27:39] the bride and morning star.
[27:42] And we know of course there's the the
[27:44] parable of the swer. We're not going to
[27:45] get into it but it says the seed is the
[27:47] word of God.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the parable
[27:51] &gt;&gt; in Romans 8:17. Just a few more
[27:53] scriptures. And if children, then heirs,
[27:54] that's seed. Heirs of God and joint hes
[27:57] with Christ. If so be that we suffer
[27:59] with him that we may also be that we may
[28:02] be also glorified together again. So
[28:05] that's that's our promise.
[28:09] And then u think two more scriptures.
[28:11] Verily, verily, I say unto you, except
[28:14] the corn of wheat fall into the ground
[28:17] and die, it abideth alone. But if it
[28:20] die, it brings forth much fruit.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Man, it's transformed,
[28:26] right? It's transformed from that seed
[28:28] life and it manifests what was in it and
[28:31] it goes forth and it has the it's alive.
[28:34] It can reproduce. It can move. It can
[28:35] grow. And it just means amazing that it
[28:38] can result back in the original the
[28:40] original life.
[28:41] I think this is the last quote that we
[28:43] have. The spoken word is the original
[28:45] seed. But oh God, where there's a germ
[28:49] of life come from the real seed
[28:53] that God proved it was his seed. He rose
[28:57] him up again. See that through that life
[29:02] that's going over the original seed
[29:05] like was given to Eve over his real
[29:09] church is bringing forth life again
[29:12] through the birth through the womb of
[29:14] the his bride. See? Oh, it's rich and
[29:17] glorious. I give it a little time to
[29:20] study and it it'll sink in. He's that
[29:24] seed.
[29:26] He's that seed that was produced by the
[29:29] word of God. Be it unto me according to
[29:32] thy word.
[29:34] There's the seed. See, taking the word.
[29:38] Taking the word. See? And it says seed
[29:42] life. God bless you, brothers.
