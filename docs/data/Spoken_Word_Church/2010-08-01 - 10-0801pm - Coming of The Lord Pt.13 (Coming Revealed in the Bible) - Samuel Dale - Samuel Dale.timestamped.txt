[30:23] 4:1 and the angel that talked with me
[30:26] came again and wed me as a man that is
[30:28] wakened out of his sleep and he said
[30:30] unto me what seest thou and I said I
[30:32] have looked and behold a Candlestick all
[30:36] of gold with a bowl upon the top of it
[30:38] and his seven lamps there own and seven
[30:41] pipes to the seven lamps which are upon
[30:44] the top
[30:45] thereof the two olive trees and two
[30:47] olive trees by it one upon the right
[30:51] side of the bowl and the other upon the
[30:53] left side thereof so I answered and
[30:56] spake to the angel that talked with me
[30:58] saying what are these my Lord then the
[31:00] angel that talked with me answered and
[31:03] said unto me knowest thou not what these
[31:06] be and I said no my Lord then he
[31:09] answered and spake unto me saying this
[31:12] is the word of the Lord unto zeruel
[31:14] saying not by might nor by power but by
[31:18] my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts who
[31:21] art thou oh great Mountain before

[31:26] shall bring forth The Headstone d RO
[31:28] with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto

[31:46] unto you for who ha despised the day of
[31:49] small things for they shall rejoice and
[31:51] shall see the plummet in the hand of
[31:53] zerubabel with the seven with those
[31:57] seven they are the eyes of the Lord
[31:59] which run to and fro through the whole
[32:02] earth you may be seated to the Lord at

[32:31] things and showing them
[32:34] and thank you
[32:37] baby and it come down to speak of the
[32:39] stone and it became down to speak of the
[32:41] Cornerstone you know the things and and
[32:45] it's showing see the Bible is written to
[32:49] reveal God to the people would you
[32:54] follow that line the Bible is God's word
[32:58] that he has given unto us to reveal
[33:02] himself unto us right by the opening of
[33:06] his Worden all right now he not only
[33:08] then just gave us the Written
[33:12] Letter he also gave us someone to
[33:16] interpret that because we chose that we
[33:19] we asked for it you know and that we
[33:21] chose to let God speak not man but there
[33:25] in Moses and then when God gave Moses
[33:29] the Ten Commandments see that was the
[33:31] word of God all right he wrote five
[33:34] books off of that and uh you know but
[33:39] the tables of stone was what we're
[33:41] talking about this morning was in the
[33:43] Ark of the Covenant and that was all
[33:45] which were the Ten Commandments and when
[33:47] they came into the temple that was
[33:50] completed or finished there in the
[33:53] scriptures of the the time in the
[33:55] wilderness and also the time in the it
[33:58] doesn't mention them in the the original
[34:01] ones you know it brings it on over to
[34:05] Ezra and Nehemiah and the Zachariah when
[34:09] it speaks of the tables of stone you
[34:12] know going into the temple but you know
[34:15] God is trying as I said to trying to
[34:17] reveal himself to mankind by his written
[34:21] word the prophet said first it was
[34:23] written in heaven you know and and the
[34:26] and then it was written in the pyramid
[34:27] and then written on letter by
[34:31] man but God is Not only trying to reveal
[34:35] himself to man that's the original plan
[34:38] and part of it you know but he wanted to
[34:41] reveal
[34:43] man you know himself he wanted to show
[34:47] us what we are or what he has made
[34:51] us he's made us a great thing and he's
[34:55] wanting us to see what he has made us
[34:59] you know it is he that hath made us and
[35:01] not we ourselves we are his people the
[35:03] Sheep of his Pastor the the psalmist was
[35:05] say but that's what I'm trying to get me
[35:08] and you to
[35:10] see that you know the Lord is trying to
[35:14] not only reveal himself but he's trying
[35:16] to reveal you and I I believe it's page
[35:18] 74 Christ of mystery where that the
[35:20] prophet said the bride is part of the
[35:23] mystery and being part of the mystery
[35:25] you know what she must be revealed
[35:28] right so then i' I'm I'm saying this now
[35:30] for this the the part that I want to get
[35:33] to after a
[35:34] while I told you if you want to see
[35:36] yourself see we were we were taught
[35:39] never to read the book of Revelations
[35:41] because it was in symbolics and we
[35:44] couldn't understand it you know and all
[35:47] like that you know well there's a lot of
[35:49] the symbolics that was in The Book of
[35:51] Revelation that God himself
[35:53] explained right and uh you know so it's
[35:56] no problem but then when the Prophet
[35:58] came we don't have any trouble but to me
[36:00] if you was to take away the entire you
[36:02] you know you going to take the Bible
[36:04] away from me and you said we're going to
[36:06] give you one book out of the
[36:09] Bible and you know you must take that
[36:12] and and live off of it and all you know
[36:14] what I would take I would take the Book
[36:15] of Revelations
[36:19] amen I would take the Book of
[36:21] Revelations go over any book that is in
[36:23] the Bible am because you remember I've
[36:25] tried to get you to see that the book of
[36:27] Revelations is the only book that's
[36:29] dealing personally directly to revealing
[36:32] you amen right it's revealing God in you
[36:36] you show me after service I'll be glad
[36:39] to sit in my office with you and you
[36:41] take the Book of Revelations and you
[36:43] show me Jesus Christ anywhere revealed
[36:45] in the Book of Revelation apart from
[36:50] mankind now you know what I mean by that
[36:52] you get in in Revelations 5 and you'll
[36:54] see one sitting on the throne but then
[36:55] there's a bride around the throne right
[36:57] M all right now you understand what I'm
[36:59] saying all right you'll see this that or
[37:02] the other but you'll always see the
[37:04] bride so to me the the Book of
[37:07] Revelations is the bride's
[37:08] book and that's what we want to title
[37:11] this this afternoon I didn't really know
[37:12] what the title was but I I believe that
[37:15] the coming of the Lord is the revealing
[37:17] of his word taught you that over and
[37:19] over I believe
[37:20] it I believe it started on the day of
[37:22] Pentecost in the baptism of the Holy
[37:25] Ghost you know started his second coming
[37:28] all right now then in doing that see
[37:32] then the title of the message is his
[37:36] coming or coming revealed in the
[37:41] Bible I don't believe God does anything
[37:44] that he doesn't show it in his word
[37:47] right he shows it in his word amen okay
[37:51] because that would be the complete
[37:54] revelation of Jesus Christ you know God
[37:57] on
[37:58] all right so he's coming his coming is
[38:01] being should be revealed to us in the
[38:03] Bible amen all right and you say but now
[38:07] uh we don't understand about we' got the
[38:09] prophet to express what the Bible is
[38:11] saying yet your Prophet himself said you
[38:14] don't have to change it he said you just
[38:17] take it what it
[38:20] says it's self-explanatory to where you
[38:23] know that we should understand now
[38:26] that's just like
[38:27] I said this morning read in
[38:30] Zachariah that Zachariah is shown seven
[38:34] golden
[38:35] candlesticks but he didn't
[38:38] understand H now he's a prophet so he
[38:42] knows God is not just dealing with him
[38:45] now um Joseph ran me off some things
[38:48] about that manora of the nine and the
[38:50] Seven right and uh it's all in my office
[38:53] You' be glad to have it I mean you can
[38:55] have it if you want it don't your
[38:57] computer it doesn't matter it'll come up
[38:59] there is a a nine candlesticks monora
[39:02] and it has a reason for being that in in
[39:05] the doing but then there is a seven
[39:08] golden candlesticks see and we read here
[39:10] in Zechariah that you know of the seven
[39:14] candlesticks and then or lamps you know
[39:17] and then U it took me back and I should
[39:21] have brought the scriptures but I just
[39:22] kind of assume everybody understands so
[39:24] you know I'm sorry that if maybe uh you
[39:28] don't just fully understand when I say
[39:30] candlesticks and I but Moses remember
[39:33] built the uh back in uh Exodus 3 25 31
[39:39] through about 37 Moses built the seven
[39:42] golden candlesticks and put it into the
[39:45] church so you know it it would come down
[39:49] from there cuz he built it now you have
[39:51] to be careful reading because it sound
[39:53] like he's only building six but then you
[39:55] read down to verse 37 and it says seven
[39:57] you know but uh you know my point is
[40:01] this or what I'm bringing that up
[40:03] for why would Zachariah be the fact that
[40:07] he wouldn't understand if he could see
[40:09] seven golden
[40:10] candlesticks would not that seven golden
[40:13] candlesticks be the same thing that he
[40:14] showed Moses and showed him how to build
[40:17] it maybe Zachariah had seen the seven
[40:19] golden
[40:21] candlesticks there were many times they
[40:23] were destroyed and taken back and made
[40:25] many of them and put them in many places
[40:26] and ET Etc backwards and forth and uh
[40:30] looked like he would have said well I
[40:32] see seven going to candles stick just
[40:33] like Moses built but he didn't he just
[40:36] plainly said I don't
[40:39] understand see and God was going to show
[40:43] him if you missed this morning's message
[40:46] please go back and
[40:47] listen God was showing
[40:50] Zachariah the seven golden candlesticks
[40:53] and what it would be and how that it
[40:55] would be the God revealing himself down
[41:00] through seven Church
[41:02] ages coming down to the end time and
[41:05] showing us the end time of where we live
[41:09] and how that we are here see and showing
[41:12] verse six then is what is this I don't
[41:18] know then he answered and spake unto me
[41:21] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[41:24] jerus saying not by power and by might
[41:27] or by my but by my spirit sayth the Lord
[41:30] H it was showing God to be revealing
[41:33] himself in the church ages and that's
[41:35] where we'll go in a little bit when we
[41:37] get to Point I've got something else I
[41:38] wanted you to see but we'll get over to
[41:41] that in a minute and we'll go to
[41:42] Revelations and and pick up this seven
[41:45] golden candlesticks to show it over
[41:47] there now what I want you to see is I'm
[41:52] I keep driving the point the prophet
[41:55] said God would be visible Among Us and
[41:58] raise the dead and we go into
[42:00] Rapture but he said he would not be here
[42:03] in a physical
[42:04] body we would meet that body in the air
[42:08] in the
[42:09] Rapture all right but now see visible
[42:12] Among Us is not visible like you know
[42:16] I'm holding up a bottle of olive oil you
[42:19] know and say well that's the way it's
[42:21] got to be
[42:22] now you know got to be like that be
[42:25] visible no
[42:28] if God is revealing himself to
[42:32] you now which had you rather
[42:35] have the understanding of the seven
[42:38] golden candlesticks verse 1 and
[42:41] two as to what Moses
[42:45] made you
[42:47] know or had youd rather have it as we
[42:50] read in verse 6 and 7 and going down
[42:54] that this would be the word of the Lord
[43:00] this would be God revealing himself
[43:02] which would you rather
[43:04] have after have God revealing
[43:07] himself but now he can't reveal himself
[43:10] contrary to the letter you hear a lot
[43:12] about in the people they take it and do
[43:14] it you know where brother Brown says you
[43:16] read between the
[43:17] lines well just remember that if you're
[43:20] reading between the lines it can't be
[43:22] contrary to what's on the line right but
[43:25] that's what the people of the message is
[43:26] take it they read between the lines and
[43:29] they get any kind of Doctrine they
[43:31] want right bless see I'm reading between
[43:34] the lines not read the line that's right
[43:37] and if the line verifies what you're
[43:39] saying we can talk about being between
[43:42] the lines right but if it don't verify
[43:45] that forget it you know all right now
[43:48] but be invisible Among Us I said it
[43:50] three times this morning and I believe
[43:52] it we've all spoke of and all around the
[43:55] message of the hour for 4 years now
[43:58] we've been talking about the coming of
[43:59] The
[44:01] Headstone all right I believe the coming
[44:03] of The Headstone is the revealing of the
[44:05] word of God I believe it I believe the
[44:08] headstone is the what the prophet said
[44:11] it was back Dar as it went into the
[44:13] temple when they got it completed that
[44:14] it was the Ten Commandments or the seals
[44:17] he said I believe that was the part that
[44:20] was not made known back there even in
[44:23] Jesus's Ministry he preached six seals
[44:26] but he didn't tell nobody that's what he
[44:28] was a
[44:29] preaching he spoke of it all right but
[44:32] then the prophet in the end time came
[44:35] and God revealed the seals I believe the
[44:37] seals are The Headstone to the church
[44:39] because headstone and Cornerstone is the
[44:41] same Stone except for the difference of
[44:43] the position that's doing it was the
[44:45] Cornerstone in the apostles the prophet
[44:48] said but said in the full church it's
[44:50] The
[44:51] Headstone now I believe that headstone
[44:53] to the Bride of Jesus Christ as around
[44:56] the world now not just one individual
[44:58] having it I believe brother random had
[45:00] that headstone don't
[45:01] you I believe that now I believe he was
[45:04] adopted manifested son of
[45:06] God and but now when the Bride of Jesus
[45:09] Christ around the world comes to the
[45:12] position of adoption it's only going and
[45:14] The Headstone unites with the body of
[45:18] Christ then it's not going to be
[45:20] long because it wasn't long when Jesus
[45:24] was shown on the Mount of
[45:25] transfiguration about somewhere close to
[45:27] 6 months from there to Calvary so then
[45:31] don't look for it to be a long time uh
[45:34] the reason that we haven't uh reason
[45:37] we're here 40 years 40 something years
[45:39] later after the prophet has gone is
[45:42] because you and I didn't understand the
[45:44] revealed word oh we had the
[45:48] letter yeah I I purchased a computer in
[45:51] the first ones it was one of the first
[45:53] ones brother Neil hav with his group now
[45:56] brother M had one earlier but I
[45:58] purchased one with brother Neil havin
[45:59] that's been what 30 years almost 30
[46:01] years ago uh see well you know what that
[46:05] computer had everything brother around
[46:06] said as far as they had
[46:07] entered but you know that dumb thing
[46:09] couldn't tell me
[46:12] a when we got it set up you've heard me
[46:14] tell about it I you know I bought it
[46:17] $3,500 for the computer and the message
[46:20] you know set it up at the house got it
[46:23] all ready brother hav walked to stru
[46:25] doing an an me put it together and we
[46:28] got through and I said boy now we can do
[46:30] something called we get a word search of
[46:32] course it was Dosh but it was all right
[46:35] so I typed in serpent you know what it
[46:37] came up
[46:39] zero I said now here I done pay $ 3500
[46:41] for this booger and you know how many
[46:44] times brother R used the word
[46:46] Serpent and here I am I can't find one
[46:49] of them and I said look at the
[46:52] spelling I spelled it word wrong was the
[46:56] computer's fault so when I spelled it
[46:58] right the computer there it was all of
[47:00] them quotes hey I was feeling good but
[47:03] understanding what I'm saying the
[47:04] computer had the message but it didn't
[47:06] have the Revelation right intellectually
[47:09] I I have done as much as read six books
[47:11] a day and listened to two tapes and I
[47:14] used to be called an educated Theologian
[47:17] but they kind of left the education off
[47:19] now in the Theologian too and just call
[47:21] me an intellect but that's all right I
[47:23] still love to read and study the
[47:25] prophet's message and if if that's wrong
[47:27] then you know I guess I'm wrong I just I
[47:29] just love to do it but you know because
[47:31] I believe in brother R was a prophet I
[47:33] believe he has the answer to all things
[47:36] I I don't believe me and you has too
[47:37] many He he'll tell you how to raise kids
[47:39] he'll tell you how to fish he'll tell
[47:41] you how to
[47:43] hunt oh you just you get in there
[47:45] hunting you know he said get down wind
[47:47] or stay over here stay over there don't
[47:49] do this you learn how to hunt listen to
[47:51] The Prophet you know cuz he got it all
[47:54] the way around but let me get off of
[47:55] that you know but see I believe that
[47:57] headstone came to the
[47:59] prophet which was those seals right now
[48:03] that didn't mean it was for me and you
[48:04] at that time right come wasn't there
[48:07] that's right brother Hal was there and
[48:10] brother Gary uh was there when the seals
[48:13] was preached but I believe he tell you
[48:15] he didn't understand a whole lot about
[48:17] what that Prophet had to say about it
[48:19] you know all right but you see
[48:22] irregardless the revealed word is The
[48:24] Headstone now here's the statement I
[48:26] made this morning morning I believe that
[48:28] the headstone uniting with the body of
[48:31] Jesus Christ not one individual the
[48:33] entire body of Christ around the world
[48:35] that that will be the closest thing that
[48:38] you'll ever see to the actual presence
[48:41] of almighty God dwelling upon Earth in
[48:44] the end time amen because that is the
[48:47] revealed word right would you not agree
[48:50] that that would be the headstone the
[48:51] Cornerstone was the faith of the fathers
[48:53] and The Headstone is that you know the
[48:56] the word all now here's what I want you
[48:59] to
[49:00] see the prophet said 363 Church age book
[49:03] number one on your notes that with the
[49:05] restoration of Power with the
[49:07] restoration of word comes restoration of
[49:10] power well we've been here 40 something
[49:12] years and we've read the message we read
[49:14] the message we read the message where's
[49:16] the power well I got another one over
[49:18] here a couple of quotes over but hold on
[49:21] before you read that one so let's just
[49:23] get to going
[49:27] the prophet goes on to show you that
[49:30] Romans or the Bible does I like to take
[49:32] the Bible and the prophet put it
[49:34] together and see what it talking about
[49:35] right Romans 1:16 And1 17 Paul said he
[49:39] wasn't ashamed of the Gospel of God
[49:42] because it was P the power of God un
[49:45] salvation right all right you want Power
[49:48] get in the
[49:50] word there's power in the word of a king
[49:53] is that right the meats and purins they
[49:55] couldn't even change it that's why
[49:56] Esther the the king could not take back
[49:59] what he had said about killing them so
[50:01] he wrote a decree they could defend
[50:02] themselves cuz he couldn't change his
[50:04] own word the word of a king cannot be
[50:07] changed or altered all right now but the
[50:10] prophet I gave it to you 117 samon
[50:12] Church age book that power without
[50:15] character is satanic but Power with
[50:18] character is fit to rule so if we're
[50:21] wanting the power of God why not deal
[50:24] with the word of God Amen yes but
[50:27] brother Dale I've heard you preach and
[50:28] you preach and yep and every time I
[50:31] preach I get a little higher or God
[50:33] revealed something to me now what is it
[50:36] to
[50:38] you uh it's never failed yet just like I
[50:41] said this morning the Lord showed me
[50:43] something about the two olive trees I'll
[50:45] get back to it later and I've been
[50:47] studying on it for over 40
[50:49] years to try to get an understanding
[50:52] because it just didn't click in my head
[50:55] I'm sorry it just don't don't click to
[50:57] me it don't click I'm just a dummy but I
[51:00] you know I I like for it to be revealed
[51:03] all right look what your Prophet said if
[51:06] you talk about see people will say but
[51:09] but brother Dale the power of God left
[51:11] when the prophet
[51:14] left well you know like that man quoted
[51:18] all God was he poured into Christ all
[51:19] Christ poured into brother randam he
[51:21] died and took it with him we don't have
[51:23] nothing no I don't agree with that if
[51:26] he's a same yesterday today and forever
[51:28] he ever was a Healer he's still a Healer
[51:30] ever was a savior he's still a savior he
[51:32] ever had power he still has
[51:35] power you're limited him by putting it
[51:37] to the basis of saying that only the
[51:39] prophet had the power of God look what
[51:41] he says on number three of your notes
[51:42] adoption 1962 522 and he's reading the
[51:46] scriptures about the eyes of our
[51:49] understanding being enlightened we may
[51:50] know the hope of the
[51:52] calling and what the riches of the glory
[51:54] of his inheritance in the saint
[51:57] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[51:59] power to us word we they say the power's
[52:05] gone the the the power hasn't even
[52:08] arrived yet
[52:10] amen no I'm sorry you know I mean like
[52:15] Paul said if I become your enemy because
[52:17] I tell you the truth I say have I become
[52:19] your enemy because I found what the
[52:21] prophet
[52:21] said you know I mean that I can't help
[52:25] it and then the one that we gave was
[52:27] quoting this morning the prophets and
[52:29] questions and answers in 54 where he
[52:32] says that after the door of the Gentile
[52:33] church is closed God will anoint a
[52:36] church and you'll see in one year what
[52:38] theologist tried to do in
[52:40] 2000 uh he said wait until the anointing
[52:43] of the church really strikes home to
[52:45] that Faithful Little
[52:47] Remnant all
[52:49] right so if you're looking for the great
[52:51] powers and the things now we're
[52:53] certainly not looking for it to happen
[52:56] as the prophet said people are looking
[52:58] for great things to happen that will be
[53:00] to the W to Witnesses right they'll
[53:03] close Heaven Etc but now we're supposed
[53:05] to have the power of God to take us into
[53:07] Rapture right so don't weaken it you
[53:10] know all right so let's just read a few
[53:12] right here on what we're talking about
[53:15] because I believe in the power of God I
[53:19] believe our problem is this is we doubt
[53:22] him we do not follow his word and you
[53:25] know stay with what he's saying so
[53:27] listen to what he says here on speak to
[53:29] the Mount 1959
[53:31] 11:23 but while we're up on that other
[53:34] he's on the church he said he's doing it
[53:35] now cuz that's what he's been doing he's
[53:37] been anointing the church all the way
[53:38] through the seven Church edges you tell
[53:40] me where he was in
[53:42] anointing see that's all we just got to
[53:45] get this way I it's great Revelation
[53:46] brother de yeah keep reading between the
[53:49] lines you will read right on over in the
[53:52] tribulation so I can't help that I'm
[53:55] sorry watch what what the prophet said I
[53:57] believe that the Church of the Living
[53:59] God is moving into it 1959 11:23 speak
[54:02] to this
[54:03] Mountain Church of the Living God is
[54:05] moving into a sphere now that's going to
[54:07] shake the whole
[54:10] world that's the first time it's been
[54:12] since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a
[54:16] human
[54:17] being ask anything that you will and it
[54:20] shall be given unto you is that Mark 11
[54:23] right anything you desire don't you see
[54:26] the words of Jesus Christ being
[54:28] fulfilled oh it's going to come to pass
[54:32] pretty soon I'm looking for it to happen
[54:34] in this meeting I'm waiting for it to
[54:37] happen now think of all the great signs
[54:39] and wonders he had seen and yet he's
[54:40] looking for
[54:42] something now that the anointing will
[54:44] strike the whole Church of the Living
[54:46] God and she'll rise to her feet like a
[54:49] mighty Army the sick will be healed by a
[54:51] word the blind will see the deaf will
[54:54] hear the dead will be raised up and the
[54:56] power of God will shake the world with
[54:58] the Church of the Living God we're in
[55:01] the process of it now I believe it's
[55:03] soon coming to pass I believe it will be
[55:05] just exactly that way I believe it's
[55:07] going to strike the Church of God soon
[55:10] and it's going to start a Revival
[55:11] that'll shake the world I believe
[55:14] it he goes on down telling his heart is
[55:17] under anticipation waiting for those
[55:20] things you say well that was only for
[55:23] him but that's you know that's all right
[55:25] that's your way of think thinking but
[55:27] now
[55:31] listen see when you read
[55:34] things automatically people
[55:39] will uh go to one extreme or the
[55:43] other you know see I can read that and
[55:47] boy everybody geared expecting great
[55:51] things well then here's the other side
[55:54] they don't understand
[55:58] all that was over with the prophet is
[56:02] finished want see that you're not going
[56:04] to satisfy everybody so forget it see
[56:07] I'm not trying to satisfy nobody I'm
[56:09] just trying to preach the
[56:12] gospel I'm not putting off something
[56:14] until this
[56:16] comes I've said it all along I believe
[56:19] God is here healing a sick and doing
[56:21] great things if we would just believe
[56:23] it and confess it yes he can take care
[56:27] of
[56:28] it I believe he's always been heing that
[56:30] because I believe Hebrews
[56:32] 13:8 right now here's what I want I want
[56:36] to show you I believe what the problem
[56:38] is see because we've heard the word by
[56:42] way of the Prophet we think we have the
[56:44] revelation of the word of
[56:47] God you know we think we have the
[56:50] revelation of the word of God you know I
[56:53] know I'm sarcastic arrogant hateful old
[56:57] Couer but you know what I like to do I
[56:59] like to get something that you don't
[57:00] know anything about and just stand up
[57:03] here and say well now who knows anything
[57:04] about it get on up and come on up
[57:08] here you said well why would you want to
[57:11] do
[57:12] that because I want you to think that
[57:15] you don't know
[57:19] everything and you better believe you
[57:21] get up here and ask me a question and I
[57:22] don't know the answer I ain't going to
[57:23] be dumb enough to get up and walk up
[57:25] there I'm going to sit back there
[57:32] too but you see I believe God has given
[57:36] us
[57:38] away but to just know the letter of the
[57:40] message it said my computers got it what
[57:43] if you had a photographic
[57:46] memory you could meor memorize the whole
[57:48] message that's right that wouldn't mean
[57:50] a thing that's
[57:53] right Paul said the let kill us but the
[57:55] spirit give us life
[57:59] but see we don't depend upon God to to
[58:03] bring it the way that he says he'll
[58:05] bring it now this is the point I want
[58:08] you to see you said well you're talking
[58:09] about yourself okay I'm talking about
[58:11] myself so forget
[58:12] it I just grin with you see cuz I don't
[58:15] care it ain't going to give me one more
[58:17] dime in my money and it ain't going to
[58:19] help me no more than anything else I'm
[58:22] just honest I just I preach if ain't
[58:25] nobody here
[58:26] my wife stays with me I'll preach to her
[58:29] you
[58:30] know now
[58:33] listen we've got to depend upon God to
[58:36] reveal his word do you
[58:39] agree now that God that we're depending
[58:42] upon to reveal his word has set certain
[58:47] guidelines that we must
[58:51] follow now you don't have to amen for a
[58:53] while cuz a lot of you ain't going to
[58:55] amen the any anyway you
[58:58] know but just listen try to stay away
[59:01] and do that part of
[59:05] it
[59:06] but I wasn't the one that chose
[59:11] this we as a people when Moses came out
[59:14] to the burning bush he was ready for
[59:17] everybody as I've always tried to teach
[59:19] you the whole Mountain was on fire and
[59:21] there was just a bush for everybody and
[59:24] they could have talked to God
[59:27] but do a scared you know why they done
[59:30] sin 10 times before getting very far and
[59:34] problems had taken place and so they
[59:37] said Moses you go up and get it and
[59:40] bring it back and we'll do it they never
[59:42] would do what he said right but they
[59:44] told him to go get it and bring it back
[59:46] and they do what he
[59:47] said now we chose for a man to speak to
[59:50] us I wasn't back there and you down here
[59:59] we chose for God to speak to us and he
[1:00:02] sent us
[1:00:04] away he gave us a
[1:00:07] prophet
[1:00:08] right now we can kind of stay right
[1:00:11] there can't we unless he differs with
[1:00:13] something we don't
[1:00:15] like oh my but what about a five-fold
[1:00:19] ministry that's
[1:00:24] right you know where it says he gave
[1:00:26] some Apostles and some proph you know
[1:00:28] those are gifts that are given to the
[1:00:29] church there in
[1:00:31] Ephesians and that's a five-fold
[1:00:33] Ministry I gave you a couple of quotes
[1:00:36] just for something for you to think on
[1:00:38] about I'm trying to get you to
[1:00:40] see that we've got to have the revealed
[1:00:43] word are the word revealed unto us
[1:00:45] brother brownon says on who is who is
[1:00:46] this mzd 1956 he says the Revelation is
[1:00:50] Sovereign number six on your
[1:00:53] note the Revelation is sovereign
[1:01:00] God's Sovereign in his
[1:01:05] choosing even the Revelation is
[1:01:09] Sovereign the re the very Revelation
[1:01:11] itself is Sovereign in God Amen that's
[1:01:14] how people Ponder at it and jump at
[1:01:16] things and hit all things not knowing
[1:01:18] what they're
[1:01:20] doing God
[1:01:23] Sovereign he reveals to who he want
[1:01:25] wants to that's right well I read every
[1:01:29] book lord it's your
[1:01:32] fault I read every book blist never tape
[1:01:35] and here one man over here just heard
[1:01:37] one tape and and you done reveal
[1:01:39] something to him now that's Cain and
[1:01:41] Abel again so you must be able to figure
[1:01:43] out somewhere which side you're on right
[1:01:45] about now on that basis
[1:01:47] yourself but then he gets down to the
[1:01:49] message of Grace 1961 827 and he's
[1:01:52] talking about God has five offices
[1:01:55] Apostles prophet F his pastors and teach
[1:01:57] he says they're sovereignly
[1:02:00] given you can't pray for them now he
[1:02:03] didn't mean you don't pray for me you
[1:02:05] don't pray for
[1:02:07] gifts gifts and callings are without God
[1:02:09] I mean without repentance right you
[1:02:11] don't you don't pray for gifts you pray
[1:02:14] to stir at the gift that is within you
[1:02:16] right amen you use the gift
[1:02:17] correctly but now
[1:02:19] once then in doing
[1:02:23] that that's what God put out there you
[1:02:26] got to depend on it and you're Prophet I
[1:02:29] agree with him he said it's hard for one
[1:02:31] human to believe another
[1:02:33] human you I come out here and say God
[1:02:35] spoke to me I look at the faces and some
[1:02:38] are grinning and some are frowning and
[1:02:40] some are asleep some you don't know
[1:02:42] which one's what I was laughing today
[1:02:45] thinking about the absenteeism here you
[1:02:47] know absenteeism is about like the
[1:02:50] Braves ball team I don't know much about
[1:02:53] it but I do know they do that but you
[1:02:56] know they get in the winning streak and
[1:02:57] they'll they'll win about six or eight
[1:02:59] games in a
[1:03:01] row well that's way some of you are you
[1:03:05] do pretty good for a
[1:03:07] while but then all at once they get in a
[1:03:09] slump and they lose about six or eight
[1:03:11] or all right that's the way people do
[1:03:15] feel me what kind of bat average do we
[1:03:18] have but that's up to you you claim the
[1:03:21] raptures coming and then you want to
[1:03:23] stay at home well I get it off the
[1:03:25] internet what if internet
[1:03:29] clicks well brother Dale you repeat
[1:03:32] yourself so much till we'll hear at next
[1:03:35] service that might be true but it might
[1:03:39] not
[1:03:41] listen but do you believe in a five-fold
[1:03:44] Ministry and do you trust it you say
[1:03:46] well I'm here
[1:03:47] today that's true but you can be sitting
[1:03:49] here and not be dependent upon the
[1:03:51] fivefold ministry
[1:03:53] right you can be sitting here listening
[1:03:56] to see if the fivefold ministry is going
[1:03:57] to agree with
[1:03:59] you or preach it the way you want it
[1:04:02] preached okay but now even in the
[1:04:05] fivefold ministry itself how many of
[1:04:08] ministers believe in the five-fold
[1:04:10] ministry how many
[1:04:12] ministers is it kind of like a man told
[1:04:14] me one time I said something about tithe
[1:04:16] paying and he said does a pastor pay
[1:04:22] tithe I said he's the first
[1:04:24] one he said well who do he pay it
[1:04:29] to I said
[1:04:31] well you can't pay it to
[1:04:34] yourself so that's a good
[1:04:36] point but you need to find somewhere you
[1:04:39] can pay it
[1:04:40] to you know then I've tried my best to
[1:04:43] explain a simple matter of what I do is
[1:04:45] I just you know the money is there and
[1:04:48] then we just give it to these brothers
[1:04:49] that come around and preach you know the
[1:04:51] ti pay and is taking care of it
[1:04:56] but you see this thing has gotten down
[1:04:58] until people are dealing with really a
[1:05:00] oneman Ministry and they're not brother
[1:05:02] random they're themselves and they're
[1:05:05] the only one that's got
[1:05:07] it but that's all right and see then
[1:05:12] when I come along and then I bring up
[1:05:14] something it's like we was in a
[1:05:15] ministers meeting one time and I got up
[1:05:18] and it was in a subject was on and I
[1:05:20] asked a question
[1:05:22] and I thought this man he's he's pretty
[1:05:25] smart fellow
[1:05:26] I would call his name but a lot of
[1:05:28] people wouldn't know it but I had the
[1:05:30] services over with he said you know what
[1:05:32] I hate he said I hate a guy that asks a
[1:05:37] question that he's the only one in the
[1:05:39] building that's got the answer for
[1:05:42] it I looked at him I said I wouldn't ask
[1:05:44] that question if I had wasn't the only
[1:05:46] one that didn't have it I mean that did
[1:05:48] have it cuz I figured nobody else
[1:05:51] didn't I know they got mad at me one
[1:05:53] time because I said you guys ain't added
[1:05:55] this is in a big ministers meeting I
[1:05:58] said you guys ain't added one word to
[1:05:59] what the Lord revealed to me in 82 when
[1:06:01] I preached him seals they didn't like it
[1:06:04] I don't
[1:06:05] worry and I didn't mean I'd preached
[1:06:08] everything I explained it some of you
[1:06:10] were sitting there I explained what I
[1:06:12] was saying amen what I was saying will
[1:06:14] God reveal one one God he revealed a
[1:06:17] seals he revealed a marriage and divorce
[1:06:19] he revealed marage and divorce you know
[1:06:22] to us he revealed all those things and
[1:06:23] everything was in order but now
[1:06:28] listen let's get on with what I'm trying
[1:06:30] to get to
[1:06:31] you we've got to believe in a five-fold
[1:06:34] Ministry to bring us for they're they
[1:06:36] are for the perfecting of the Saints and
[1:06:39] remember Romans 1:15 161 17 that the
[1:06:43] gospel is the power of God under
[1:06:44] salvation so the gospel would have to
[1:06:46] depend upon having a fivefold ministry
[1:06:49] right okay brother around and said I'm
[1:06:51] taking these things break them down big
[1:06:52] nuggets these ministers break it down
[1:06:54] into small smaller
[1:06:57] ones see but now follow me let's see if
[1:07:03] you agree for a little while
[1:07:08] now as we read in
[1:07:11] Zechariah of the seven golden
[1:07:15] candlesticks and what he done he was
[1:07:19] showing to
[1:07:21] Zachariah the seven Church
[1:07:24] ages now brother Rand said there seven
[1:07:26] Church AG in the Old Testament and seven
[1:07:28] in the new I cannot place the seven in
[1:07:31] the old because he never placed them he
[1:07:33] placed a few of them like marry him uh
[1:07:36] going through uh dancing in the spirit
[1:07:39] and things he said that was the
[1:07:40] Pentecostals well if I can never find
[1:07:42] them I'll be glad to give them to you
[1:07:43] but I can't but I believe him I believe
[1:07:46] there were seven Church ages in the Old
[1:07:47] Testament I believe there seven in the
[1:07:48] new the Old Testament would end with the
[1:07:51] seventh Church age probably because it
[1:07:53] would end up with John the Baptist to
[1:07:56] introduce the Messiah and the church
[1:07:58] ages would end with the Elijah Ministry
[1:08:01] in the last days to introduce the
[1:08:03] Messiah so we've got some things we can
[1:08:05] go by but now have you really thought
[1:08:08] about
[1:08:10] it is saying this morning that those
[1:08:13] Church
[1:08:15] ages I believe the church ages is God
[1:08:18] revealing
[1:08:20] himself right as I said about the Book
[1:08:22] of Revelations it is a bride's book
[1:08:26] he is revealing himself in the church
[1:08:29] right all right now if we can prove that
[1:08:32] part we should we should be somewhere
[1:08:34] closer to understanding you know the the
[1:08:38] things now I'll give you this uh if you
[1:08:40] look at number eight on your notes patas
[1:08:42] Vision uh which is church a book page 50
[1:08:45] brother randam is explaining uh the two
[1:08:48] olive trees down to bottom the two trees
[1:08:51] represent the Old and New Testament and
[1:08:54] of course the old tifies the Holy Spirit
[1:08:57] who alone can give the light of God to
[1:08:59] the people the angel who spoke to
[1:09:01] Zachariah was as much is
[1:09:04] saying this what you see means that the
[1:09:07] church cannot accomplish anything by its
[1:09:10] own might or power but by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:15] all right so then what is he
[1:09:22] saying what is he saying to us
[1:09:27] not by power not by might look at the
[1:09:29] number nine and you'll have to find it
[1:09:31] it's a whole page with the line of it
[1:09:34] okay and then we got a piece on the back
[1:09:37] we'll get to it's the message of Grace
[1:09:39] 1961
[1:09:41] 827 the prophet is using that scripture
[1:09:43] of
[1:09:45] Zechariah and he says there in the part
[1:09:48] of it he's talking about Zachariah and
[1:09:50] he said did you see the message will not
[1:09:52] come by some great mights or Powers but
[1:09:55] by the spirit of God we're all
[1:09:57] acquainted with this scripture paragraph
[1:09:59] 48 that reads the Bible we know that
[1:10:04] this was during the time of the
[1:10:05] preparation of the restoration of the
[1:10:07] temple and zerubabel was a great Prince
[1:10:09] among the people who had laid the
[1:10:11] foundation of the building now this is
[1:10:13] some of this morning you know but come
[1:10:14] on we holding it together and you I want
[1:10:17] you to put on your spiritual thinking
[1:10:19] anointing jacket this morning as we
[1:10:21] think and this great Prince that had
[1:10:24] determined to rebuild the house of the
[1:10:26] Lord and then when he did he had laid
[1:10:28] the foundation stone and we read on
[1:10:30] further we find out that God said aable
[1:10:34] has laid the foundation with his hands
[1:10:36] he also shall bring forth The Headstone
[1:10:38] I want you to notice he never said he
[1:10:40] shall bring forth the Cornerstone he
[1:10:42] shall bring forth The Headstone we all
[1:10:45] know that the scripture says that Jesus
[1:10:47] is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also
[1:10:50] the headstone now if you will think for
[1:10:52] a few minutes that the seven Church
[1:10:55] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:10:57] the children back to the fathers in
[1:10:59] other words rebuild the church again
[1:11:01] under the power of the spirit not by
[1:11:04] power not by might but by my spirit
[1:11:06] sayith the Lord not by organizations not
[1:11:08] by denominations but by the Holy Spirit
[1:11:11] H Holy Spirit God will bring forth the
[1:11:15] church in the last days all right now do
[1:11:18] you see what he saying
[1:11:21] jerub being in the book of Zechariah is
[1:11:25] representing the end time
[1:11:27] messenger that would be on the scene in
[1:11:29] the end time to bring the word all right
[1:11:32] and so that's what Zachariah is being
[1:11:36] shown is the church
[1:11:42] ages now keep it in mind he's being
[1:11:44] shown the church ages you say well I
[1:11:46] agree with that but I want you to hold
[1:11:48] that point for a few seconds paragraph
[1:11:51] 51 jeru Prince with Prince with Joshua
[1:11:54] was a one that that was to bring forth
[1:11:55] The Headstone he had L laid the
[1:11:58] foundation he took the people back to
[1:11:59] the foundation and tip which we all know
[1:12:02] that these candle sticks and so forth
[1:12:04] represented both Jewish and church they
[1:12:08] were Olive branches the Bible said here
[1:12:11] and the Olive Branch we are we are the
[1:12:14] wild wild branch that was grafted into
[1:12:17] the root of the T Olive Tree Gentiles
[1:12:20] and out of these two branches come
[1:12:22] sensor pipes going into the seven golden
[1:12:24] candle sticks to give the light to the
[1:12:26] seven Church ages now I'm trying to
[1:12:29] prove to you and I that the coming of
[1:12:33] the Lord is already taking place not
[1:12:36] something to look
[1:12:37] for it's been taking place since
[1:12:39] Pentecost amen because it's been the
[1:12:42] revealing of his
[1:12:44] word now all right you
[1:12:48] agree let's go over now to Revelations 1
[1:12:59] okay you read the whole thing we'll just
[1:13:01] jump over try to get to a
[1:13:03] place look at verse
[1:13:06] 12 of
[1:13:08] Revelations
[1:13:11] 1 and I turned to see the voice that
[1:13:13] spake with me and being turned I saw
[1:13:15] seven golden
[1:13:19] candlesticks
[1:13:22] now the same thing EX
[1:13:26] Zar we see it right seven golden cap St
[1:13:31] okay now but remember now Zachariah
[1:13:36] didn't
[1:13:37] understand the fullness what would take
[1:13:40] place in the
[1:13:41] ages
[1:13:42] Etc the
[1:13:44] time he was an Old Testament Prophet
[1:13:47] looking
[1:13:49] forward John is taken to patmas not John
[1:13:52] the Baptist John the Revelator with the
[1:13:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost is taken to
[1:13:57] patmas and going to be shown the future
[1:14:00] Church Ages which is chapter 23 and
[1:14:03] going through all right but before he
[1:14:06] does look what he shown to him and I
[1:14:08] turn to see the voice that spake with me
[1:14:10] and being turned I saw seven golden
[1:14:16] Candlestick John do you
[1:14:22] understand yeah understand and I read
[1:14:25] Zechariah and I read
[1:14:27] Moses understand seven go count I know
[1:14:30] all about seven that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven
[1:14:33] and then you got the bowl and then you
[1:14:34] got this and then you got that and you
[1:14:36] got this thing go here and this I
[1:14:38] understand it I got the
[1:14:41] reev now look what he got into trouble
[1:14:44] with
[1:14:44] it verse
[1:14:46] 13 he saw something very
[1:14:52] unusual right right
[1:14:56] and the midst of seven golden
[1:14:58] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[1:15:03] man clothed with a garment down to the
[1:15:05] foot and G about the pouch with a golden
[1:15:09] girdle his head and his hes were white
[1:15:11] like wool white as snow and his eyes
[1:15:14] were as a flame of fire feet like
[1:15:16] undefined brace as they burn in a
[1:15:18] furnace and the voice as a sound of many
[1:15:21] water and he had in his right hand Seven
[1:15:24] Stars out of his mouth went a sharp
[1:15:26] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[1:15:28] as the sun that shineth in his strength
[1:15:32] and when I saw him I fell at his
[1:15:38] feet watch you and he laid his right
[1:15:42] hand upon me saying fear not I am the
[1:15:44] first and the
[1:15:45] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:15:47] and behold I am aive forever more amen
[1:15:50] and have the keys of hell and
[1:15:52] death if that is a Scofield Bible you're
[1:15:55] reading that's in red letter signifying
[1:15:58] that's what the Lord Jesus is speaking
[1:16:00] shouldn't have any trouble thinking
[1:16:01] that's what it was
[1:16:03] anyway but now
[1:16:07] John being a prophet
[1:16:10] also God shows him
[1:16:14] something but does he
[1:16:18] understand he literally falls down to
[1:16:21] the feet to
[1:16:23] worship number 11 on your notes patas
[1:16:25] Vision brother Rand said that is not a
[1:16:31] prophet that was
[1:16:35] God must read
[1:16:38] letter personally
[1:16:42] speaking all
[1:16:44] right what did John
[1:16:47] see well they saw seven golden
[1:16:52] candlesticks later on he's given the
[1:16:55] word to go to each Church age of those
[1:16:58] seven right but before he goes he's
[1:17:01] given a
[1:17:05] vision translation whatever you want to
[1:17:07] call it and he sees one standing in the
[1:17:11] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:17:14] like unto the son of man he didn't say
[1:17:16] it was the son of man it was like unto
[1:17:18] the son of
[1:17:21] man John what did you see
[1:17:27] well I really don't know I'm like
[1:17:31] Zachariah I need an
[1:17:34] answer now God's going to give you an
[1:17:38] answer
[1:17:40] okay because now look at number 10 on
[1:17:42] your notes and you'll find brother
[1:17:44] bramon why why we are not a denomination
[1:17:47] paragraph 180
[1:17:50] 585 uh excuse me
[1:17:52] 927 1958
[1:17:56] look what he said he
[1:18:01] saw number 10 on your notes if you
[1:18:03] notice in Revelation 1 we find Jesus
[1:18:06] standing in the seven Church ages the
[1:18:09] seven golden
[1:18:11] candlesticks when he turned and saw one
[1:18:13] liken to the son of man like the son of
[1:18:15] man standing clo with a how was it it
[1:18:20] was a bride standing in the candlesticks
[1:18:23] drawn out
[1:18:26] now remember he's gir about the paps
[1:18:28] with a golden girdle which is
[1:18:31] femish you reading your scripture 13th
[1:18:35] verse gir about the PS with a golden
[1:18:37] girdle the prophet said that would be
[1:18:40] femish because the girdle would not be
[1:18:42] in that
[1:18:44] position they would have to be breasts
[1:18:46] and and all it would be femin not over
[1:18:50] the shoulder of Labor and the different
[1:18:51] things see all right so he saw that now
[1:18:56] what what did he see now go back to one
[1:18:59] the other when you have to pick it up
[1:19:01] it's no underlining and it's just page
[1:19:03] one Israel in
[1:19:05] Egypt 1953
[1:19:08] 325 now if you turn if had time to get
[1:19:10] these other scriptures in Revelation the
[1:19:12] first chapter that when John saw him
[1:19:14] standing one like unto the son of man
[1:19:16] standing in the midst of the seven
[1:19:18] golden candlesticks which was the seven
[1:19:21] Church
[1:19:22] ages and he starts off and I took this
[1:19:25] and took this and form and what it
[1:19:27] was look on down on the next one which
[1:19:30] is 52 of the church age
[1:19:32] book He's quoting that scripture one
[1:19:35] like unto the son of man there he stands
[1:19:37] one like unto the son of
[1:19:39] man as the is beautified by the
[1:19:41] beautified by the mounting of the ring
[1:19:43] so he is glorified in the midst of the
[1:19:47] churches it is the Lord's day for John
[1:19:49] sees him standing not as a priest but as
[1:19:52] the coming judge the gold gir is no
[1:19:55] longer gir about the waist where the
[1:19:58] priest must we it as he ministers to God
[1:20:01] in the holiest place but is now around
[1:20:04] his shoulders for he is not now the
[1:20:07] priest but the judge and where's he
[1:20:11] at in the
[1:20:15] bride in the
[1:20:17] bride so what is that
[1:20:20] John I saw one standing in the mid like
[1:20:23] unto the son of man
[1:20:25] he saw the
[1:20:28] bride he saw the word of God down
[1:20:31] Through the Ages now over in Chapter 2
[1:20:34] he starts writing the message to each
[1:20:37] Church
[1:20:39] age all right and each one of those
[1:20:42] Church ages gets a revelation of the
[1:20:45] deity of Jesus Christ amen right they
[1:20:50] get an overcomer position they get all
[1:20:53] the things because he's already been
[1:20:55] shown here in Revelations 1 that's why I
[1:20:58] said go into the chap book The Book of
[1:21:00] Revelations and show me Jesus Christ
[1:21:02] anywhere by
[1:21:06] himself he said well what about the lamb
[1:21:08] it takes a book where the lamb come
[1:21:15] from your Prophet said the lamb come
[1:21:17] from the seven Church
[1:21:18] ages because the lamb has seven horns
[1:21:21] and seven eyes amen he he said the lamb
[1:21:25] comes from the church
[1:21:27] ages you see why it's been so
[1:21:30] long is we haven't seen the
[1:21:33] revelation of what is taking place it's
[1:21:37] revealing who we
[1:21:38] are and what's taking here in the last
[1:21:42] days because each
[1:21:44] age is the word of God made
[1:21:49] manifest the son of man is the word of
[1:21:52] God
[1:21:54] right you agree that's why Jesus kept
[1:21:57] saying who the man the son of man
[1:21:59] am he never declared himself to be the
[1:22:01] Son of God he declared himself to be the
[1:22:03] son of man right then he's Son of God
[1:22:06] down through the seven Church ages then
[1:22:07] he's to be son of man for just a little
[1:22:09] while and your Prophet said that the
[1:22:12] Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son
[1:22:14] of man made
[1:22:17] manifest I preached that in
[1:22:21] 1968 the first sermon I preached in this
[1:22:24] message
[1:22:26] that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be
[1:22:29] the son of man which would be the word
[1:22:33] made flesh
[1:22:36] again Theus word when he comes in with a
[1:22:39] headstone uniting and all like that and
[1:22:41] just for a moment the world is going to
[1:22:44] see the son of man all around the world
[1:22:47] but brother brandom was was no brother
[1:22:49] randam wasn't the son of
[1:22:51] man brother randam was a son of man yes
[1:22:55] that's what your Prophet says about it
[1:22:56] now come
[1:22:57] on he was not the son of man but to
[1:23:00] bride together around the
[1:23:04] world which is the revealed word will be
[1:23:08] the son of
[1:23:09] man that's where she shown standing here
[1:23:13] turned to see the voice that spoke to
[1:23:15] him and he did he saw the
[1:23:18] bride well why can't we read the book of
[1:23:20] Revelations and see ourselves amen
[1:23:24] what's
[1:23:26] wrong you get tied up in the symbol what
[1:23:28] does that symbol mean go ask the prophet
[1:23:30] what it
[1:23:32] means you don't have time to look it up
[1:23:34] call me I got mine written right on the
[1:23:36] side the
[1:23:37] pages L people say I ain't writing in
[1:23:39] the Bible That's the holy word well it's
[1:23:41] all right that's your wife say I want to
[1:23:43] write it down where I keep up with it
[1:23:44] cuz I wasn't in the days of the
[1:23:47] computer I was in the days when I had to
[1:23:49] remember what he said right
[1:23:51] brother we had to write it down
[1:23:56] man I I I feel so sorry for those people
[1:23:58] that try to take off what brother R says
[1:23:59] and put it in in tape form I mean book
[1:24:02] book form or write it down try it
[1:24:04] sometime take you a tape and let brother
[1:24:07] random preach and you try to write it
[1:24:09] down I don't care how fast you can write
[1:24:12] it you even that can type how much 120
[1:24:16] words a minute or something some of you
[1:24:17] type or something you try to type off
[1:24:19] what he said you better go back and
[1:24:22] reread you will literally I have went
[1:24:25] word for word almost on a tape to take
[1:24:28] me hours to write a paragraph that
[1:24:31] much one paragraph take me an hour to
[1:24:34] write you know why because even the best
[1:24:35] I could listen I wouldn't hear what he
[1:24:38] said
[1:24:39] right that's right that's right that's
[1:24:44] what we had to depend on we had to write
[1:24:46] our own concordances of course did
[1:24:48] everybody the two Souls the seventh
[1:24:49] under virtue the Peruan all of them
[1:24:51] started putting out their their their uh
[1:24:54] their books you
[1:24:56] know you know what I got everyone in I
[1:24:58] got hold
[1:25:00] of why'd you get them you didn't agree
[1:25:03] no but they had a lot of good in their
[1:25:07] concordance first 15 pages prove where
[1:25:10] their Doctrine rest of it they settle
[1:25:12] down you can just read what you wanted
[1:25:14] so
[1:25:16] amen Jacob I will I'll use anything I
[1:25:20] can used to laugh at me they did when he
[1:25:22] go to Jeffersonville they go up and they
[1:25:24] give it'd be 700 people they'd be
[1:25:28] 500 books to give out to 700 people
[1:25:33] you've heard me tell about it we'd be
[1:25:35] sitting in the back realizing you know
[1:25:37] cuz we couldn't get no certain seats we
[1:25:39] get up front was okay right brother the
[1:25:40] house if you didn't you sat in the back
[1:25:42] if you're
[1:25:43] lucky shoot I would just go I'd get up
[1:25:47] I'd just go down through there like I
[1:25:49] looking for a seat I just looking
[1:25:51] looking like that and the brothers be
[1:25:53] taking the book and handed them out to
[1:25:55] the deacons that was passing them out
[1:25:57] and when they reach down in there I'd
[1:25:58] say thank
[1:26:02] you I guess they thought I was one of
[1:26:04] the deacons just got appointed or
[1:26:05] something but you know everybody ever
[1:26:07] went with us got a
[1:26:10] book oh you see I believe in the
[1:26:14] word Jacob I'm a Shyer when it comes to
[1:26:17] the
[1:26:18] word I'll do what I can to get the word
[1:26:21] amen I've put up with a lot of people in
[1:26:23] FKS doctrines to try to understand what
[1:26:26] they were talking
[1:26:28] about you said well that's silly brother
[1:26:30] Dale I'm just well that's all right
[1:26:32] that's your way that's right but listen
[1:26:34] can you see yourself in the
[1:26:37] word that's
[1:26:39] it the Bible reveals the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:43] Christ that's right do you understand we
[1:26:45] went through Zachariah in the Old
[1:26:47] Testament we've come to the New
[1:26:48] Testament of seven golden candlesticks
[1:26:55] showing the word of
[1:26:58] God living in a
[1:27:01] people and then people have the audacity
[1:27:03] to say that Luther and them was wrong
[1:27:07] sure a lot of their Doctrine was wrong
[1:27:09] but the word of the just you live by
[1:27:10] faith was what I stand on
[1:27:16] today cuz I believe
[1:27:19] it he may have sat in
[1:27:21] the pub and drank beer and talk about a
[1:27:25] Doctrine but there's one thing about it
[1:27:28] he had the word of God for that day and
[1:27:31] if you say he didn't then you're in
[1:27:33] trouble with almighty God so that's your
[1:27:37] choice listen
[1:27:40] Church John sees the same thing
[1:27:42] Zachariah
[1:27:44] sees John bows down as we were reading
[1:27:47] there to worship this
[1:27:50] one and he wouldn't let Him worship Him
[1:27:55] because he was still in Bride
[1:27:57] form oh if you'd ever get that down and
[1:28:00] then you can read the book of Revelation
[1:28:02] read the book of Revelation Revelation
[1:28:04] looking for yourself don't read it to
[1:28:06] try to figure out how many boms fall
[1:28:07] over here and what this Falls over there
[1:28:09] that falls over there like I said to you
[1:28:12] you'll find there one time The Book of
[1:28:13] Revelation it it states emphatically
[1:28:17] that there was an earthquake and 7,000
[1:28:19] men
[1:28:21] died what about it needs to take when
[1:28:25] 300,000 di
[1:28:29] right well what we got to do then we got
[1:28:31] to look back through history and see if
[1:28:32] there's ever been where there was only
[1:28:34] 7,000
[1:28:35] died that's not what I'm getting at the
[1:28:38] point of what I'm getting at if it was
[1:28:39] 7,000 was very important how much is
[1:28:43] 300,000 how much more do we see that
[1:28:45] we're in the plagues and the vials and
[1:28:48] the things are being poured out no we're
[1:28:49] not in the tribulation no cuz that's a
[1:28:52] wrath of God poured out upon mankind but
[1:28:54] we're in a
[1:28:55] pre-tribulation but in that
[1:28:57] pre-tribulation that's when the sons and
[1:28:59] God shine Sons and Daughters of God
[1:29:01] shine like the
[1:29:04] stars it's time now to stand on our feet
[1:29:07] as I said Wednesday night and say raise
[1:29:10] God out of
[1:29:13] history and talk about how real he is go
[1:29:16] outside we got to go doctor doctor said
[1:29:19] I got this well that's what you got cuz
[1:29:21] the doctor said you got it you believe
[1:29:22] it
[1:29:26] well you go the doctor sure do got one
[1:29:28] pretty quick got to
[1:29:29] go but you want to go with
[1:29:32] me and sit down and listen to me talk to
[1:29:35] them doctors
[1:29:38] sometime and tell them that God is
[1:29:40] either you're not that's
[1:29:43] right when you think you are I'll get up
[1:29:45] and leave out of this
[1:29:49] office I don't care how fancy a doctor
[1:29:51] they are that's right or how many what
[1:29:55] he's supposed to
[1:29:57] be I want to see God made
[1:30:02] manifest we're the big
[1:30:04] hindrances cuz we're not believing it if
[1:30:08] nothing else why not believe one thing I
[1:30:12] tried to make to
[1:30:15] you in a monsoon season You Don't Pray
[1:30:18] For Rain
[1:30:21] right right right
[1:30:24] right well it's got to get dry before
[1:30:27] you pray for rain and I don't understand
[1:30:30] why we hearing it's so dry we here
[1:30:32] because God is waiting on somebody to
[1:30:34] call it
[1:30:36] right somebody to say it and he'll back
[1:30:38] it
[1:30:40] up it's happened before stood here one
[1:30:43] night and I said it won't rain until I
[1:30:45] call for it it's on record in the takes
[1:30:48] back
[1:30:51] there and we went I don't know how long
[1:30:55] I came out here and I said the Lord just
[1:30:57] showed
[1:30:59] me that it's going to start raining
[1:31:02] now and it'll rain more than it's ever
[1:31:04] rained the newspaper in Gainesville said
[1:31:07] for the month of
[1:31:09] August of that year said they had never
[1:31:12] they had never been that much rain on
[1:31:16] record church I'm telling you we serve a
[1:31:19] living God yes but when we doubt what
[1:31:22] he's doing among us then we we hinder
[1:31:24] him from doing
[1:31:26] it believe that God is with you said I
[1:31:29] can't do I'm just so
[1:31:33] sick we having help us you got to be
[1:31:37] sick before you can get
[1:31:44] well before God can show the Healer
[1:31:47] somebody had to be
[1:31:49] sick but you know where we're missing
[1:31:51] that we think we got to have super duper
[1:31:52] faith I said the Lord was dealing with
[1:31:55] me about something on
[1:31:57] faith you know that the first man that
[1:31:59] was healed was not a
[1:32:02] Christian it probably had to
[1:32:05] be sure you know Cain or Abel or one of
[1:32:10] them or something or Adam and
[1:32:12] Eve who Born Again
[1:32:15] Christians you know what they believe
[1:32:17] God and God
[1:32:19] healed when now your Prophet said I
[1:32:22] didn't he did said you don't have to
[1:32:25] have a super duper
[1:32:27] Faith he said if you can have the same
[1:32:30] Faith the first person had that was
[1:32:33] healed God is obligated to heal
[1:32:38] you the first person that was saved in
[1:32:41] the
[1:32:42] Bible was 120 in the upper room of
[1:32:46] stinking rotten cowards that was draw
[1:32:48] back up there shaking in their shoe
[1:32:50] heels as we'd call it wondering what in
[1:32:53] the world is going to take place but you
[1:32:55] know how they got saved cuz God promised
[1:32:57] he'd send the Holy
[1:33:00] Ghost it wasn't their
[1:33:05] goodness do you know what it's not our
[1:33:07] goodness that's going to save
[1:33:10] us is when we can just get ourselves out
[1:33:12] of the way and believe
[1:33:15] God God is showing us right in the word
[1:33:19] anywhere you read is you
[1:33:26] anywhere you read it's
[1:33:30] you you can read that way it changes
[1:33:35] everything the prophet said what speaks
[1:33:37] of the groom speaks of the
[1:33:41] bride all right so now what do we oh we
[1:33:46] want to get by everything we don't know
[1:33:47] but no he he was beat and wounded and
[1:33:51] but brother Dale you don't think we
[1:33:52] going to have to do that he might choose
[1:33:54] for us to do
[1:34:00] that did he choose to allow people to go
[1:34:02] through the Dark Ages and give their
[1:34:05] life for the
[1:34:09] gospel come
[1:34:13] on he might choose for us to do those
[1:34:17] things and then what we're going to do
[1:34:19] GP and complain
[1:34:25] time to call God on the scene let's
[1:34:27] stand time to call God on the
[1:34:30] scene and begin to read the Bible for
[1:34:33] ourselves get rid of our bad dis glasses
[1:34:36] you know like I've always said you know
[1:34:39] all I can read now is about
[1:34:42] TOS everything I see is two
[1:34:44] Souls well get rid of them and read
[1:34:47] something for
[1:34:50] yourself and listen to the prophet amen
[1:34:54] that's what I
[1:34:55] love and I write it right down the side
[1:34:57] of it on the Bible the prophet said this
[1:35:00] is what this was talking
[1:35:05] about this is what that's talking
[1:35:09] about I listen to Big Man in this
[1:35:11] message one time and there's a bunch of
[1:35:13] them holling amen he was preaching about
[1:35:15] the scapegoats you remember there where
[1:35:17] they kill one and put the blood on turn
[1:35:19] the other one loose he said see there
[1:35:21] said they kill one and turn the other
[1:35:22] loose he's one they kill with Jesus when
[1:35:23] that turned loose with the
[1:35:25] devil he said brother randam said
[1:35:29] that I oh
[1:35:32] God I know he didn't say that
[1:35:37] Lord and I found it brought it
[1:35:40] up know as arrogant as I am you know
[1:35:44] brought it up you know what brother Bron
[1:35:46] said if you say one of them was Jesus
[1:35:48] and the other one was the devil you know
[1:35:49] what he said he said you're sacrificing
[1:35:51] to the
[1:35:52] devil that's what your Prophet
[1:35:54] said he said both of them goats was
[1:35:59] Jesus one died and the other would
[1:36:01] carried my sins away he said the devil
[1:36:02] can't carry your sins away you see we

[1:45:03] those things but to think of where that
[1:45:06] it's going to be something for people
[1:45:08] one day you have to give an account for
[1:45:10] and a little old lady stands up and says
[1:45:12] well how far did you come to church and
[1:45:14] she said about 5 hours one way you know
[1:45:18] and it's going to be something that's
[1:45:21] going to be the thing you out understand
[1:45:23] front of us and then to somebody to say
[1:45:25] well well you know you wouldn't in
[1:45:27] church too often no I was sick so well
[1:45:30] now we had two people there in the
[1:45:31] church that you know had a knee
[1:45:33] replacement and quick as they could
[1:45:35] that's back in church right see that's
[1:45:39] going to be the
[1:45:41] witness that's going to kill people well
[1:45:44] brother Dale you're just not as sick as

[1:45:48] am I tell you what if I ever get so sick
[1:45:51] that I don't want to come to church

[1:45:59] kids are sick and my mother said you
[1:46:01] going to the doctor I said I'm going by
[1:46:02] the
[1:46:03] church and then I'm going to the

[1:46:32] the
[1:46:36] sick a lot of people don't understand it
[1:46:39] that way I reckon and they get upset
